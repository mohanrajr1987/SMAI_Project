What this means is that you have at all times 300 threads available for blocking database actions or 300 requests per second at max also if I had more resources to the server like more Ram,CPU or cores does that increase the amount of threads available For example if I buy a server that has 4 cores or etc.. would the available threads jump to 1,200  As stated before all my actions are blocking from user registration to user chats so trying to get my misconceptions out now before they become more costly.p

Positive 74354 pConsider the following example JSONp  precodeproperties      key1 a,     key2 1,     key3 null,     key4 0.56     ....     key99 zzzzz  codepre  pMy code needs to be able to parse that into some sort of Scala structure case class and back into JSON.  p  pTo me, since there are not a finite number of elements inside of codepropertiescode, this looks like a codeMap[String, T]code.  And since the value of each inner property can be of multiple types, Im not entirely sure how to represent that as a finite Scala structure.  The documentation on implicit codeReadscode, codeWritescode, and codeFormatscode make sense to me, but they dont seem to handle more complicated examples, like the above.p  pIts also entirely possible Im thinking about this completely wrong.p  pIm new to the framework as well as the language and Im having a hard time wrapping my head around how this should be represented  any insight would be greatly appreciated.p
Positive 74354 pi have a play project with multiple subprojects. It is possible to share classes from the app folder between subprojects which depends on each other. p  pI have a class with methods which should be executed before every test. I need this class for nearly every test class and it isnt practicable to have this class in every test folder for each subproject. Is it generally possible to share classes in the test folderp  pI have tested this but it doesnt seem to work. IntelliJ doesnt show any error and it seems to recognize the class i want to use. But when i execute the tests, it shows me that it cant find the class.p  pThanks in advance for your responses.p

Can someone explain this behavior.p  pException Stackp  precodeCaused by java.lang.RuntimeException java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError     at play.api.mvc.ActionBuilderanon1.applyAction.scala498 [play2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2]     at play.api.mvc.Actionanonfunapply1anonfunapply4anonfunapply5.applyAction.scala105 [play2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2]     at play.api.mvc.Actionanonfunapply1anonfunapply4anonfunapply5.applyAction.scala105 [play2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2]     at play.utils.Threads.withContextClassLoaderThreads.scala21 [play2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2]     at play.api.mvc.Actionanonfunapply1anonfunapply4.applyAction.scala104 [play2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2]     at play.api.mvc.Actionanonfunapply1anonfunapply4.applyAction.scala103 [play2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2]     at scala.Option.mapOption.scala145 [scalalibrary2.10.5.jarna]     at play.api.mvc.Actionanonfunapply1.applyAction.scala103 [play2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2]     at play.api.mvc.Actionanonfunapply1.applyAction.scala96 [play2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2]     at play.api.libs.iteratee.DoneIterateeanonfunmapM2.applyIteratee.scala741 [playiteratees2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2] Caused by java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError null     at models.Model.getTitlesModel.scala121 [classesna]     at models.Model.getMatchingTitlesModel.scala48 [classesna]     at models.Model.getMatchingTitlesModel.scala56 [classesna]     at controllers.ApplicationanonfunsearchTitle1.applyApplication.scala15 [classesna]     at controllers.ApplicationanonfunsearchTitle1.applyApplication.scala15 [classesna]     at play.api.mvc.ActionBuilderanonfunasync1.applyAction.scala456 [play2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2]     at play.api.mvc.ActionBuilderanonfunasync1.applyAction.scala456 [play2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2]     at play.api.mvc.Action.invokeBlockAction.scala533 [play2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2]     at play.api.mvc.Action.invokeBlockAction.scala530 [play2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2]     at play.api.mvc.ActionBuilderanon1.applyAction.scala493 [play2.102.4.2.jar2.4.2] Caused by com.datastax.driver.core.exceptions.AuthenticationException Authentication error on host 10.65.5.449042 Username andor password are incorrect     at com.datastax.driver.core.Connection8.applyConnection.java368 [cassandradrivercore2.1.6.jarna]     at com.datastax.driver.core.Connection8.applyConnection.java338 [cassandradrivercore2.1.6.jarna]     at com.google.common.util.concurrent.FuturesChainingListenableFuture.runFutures.java861 [guava16.0.1.jarna]     at com.google.common.util.concurrent.MoreExecutorsSameThreadExecutorService.executeMoreExecutors.java297 [guava16.0.1.jarna]     at com.google.common.util.concurrent.ExecutionList.executeListenerExecutionList.java156 [guava16.0.1.jarna]     at com.google.common.util.concurrent.ExecutionList.executeExecutionList.java145 [guava16.0.1.jarna]     at com.google.common.util.concurrent.AbstractFuture.setAbstractFuture.java185 [guava16.0.1.jarna]     at com.datastax.driver.core.ConnectionFuture.onSetConnection.java1170 [cassandradrivercore2.1.6.jarna]     at com.datastax.driver.core.ConnectionDispatcher.channelRead0Connection.java1000 [cassandradrivercore2.1.6.jarna]     at com.datastax.driver.core.ConnectionDispatcher.channelRead0Connection.java922 [cassandradrivercore2.1.6.jarna] codepre  pLin 121 in Modle.scala is the one which calls CassandrClient.getValueFromCassandraTable.

Positive 74354 pI was trying to implement my own method interceptors using annotations Guice in Play. However, it seems like those annotations would only work and therefore intercept if the containing classes are created by Guice a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8862531cantgetguicemethodinterceptiontoworkreferencea. That brings me to the question How does Transactional work outside of Controller classes in Play It is essentially a method interceptor, and it works fine no matter how the containing classes were created I can use it within my models and service classes as well.p

Positive 74354 pI come from J2EE background and am trying to write an application with Play and angular js. The application is basically a booking app which basically looks like this p  pa hrefhttpsgb.youcanbook.medemos.jsptemplategenericampthemecity relnofollowhttpsgb.youcanbook.medemos.jsptemplategenericampthemecityap  pUp until now all things were nice and easy but now theres a design decision that I need to make. In the Play framework, as I understand, the routing happens under Controller and the business logic goes under Model classes. Model classes essentially are EBean annotated domain classes. As per my limited understanding, this is where all the heavy lifting of the applicationbusiness logic needs to happen.p  pComing from a J2EE background, my mind poses a question. Is this the right way to go I know I can easily create another service class and just call them straight away from the Controller. But, is that the right way to go Or has Play just given us the freedom to go whichever route we want to takep  pAlso, in my case, I am using Firebase as my backend store so EBean annotated classes dont make much sense. I can use spring but I dont want to take that route as that would mix in J2EE flavour which I want to avoid for the time being. p

Negative 74354 pUser would open the app and it would ask if User wants to use the camera or use a saved picture. If user selects camera, it would link with the camera view so that they can immediately take a picture.  Application would present the user with an outline of a human body so as to match up with a subject they wish to photograph. img srchttpi36.tinypic.com16llp9s.png altalt text p  pExample  this would be clear except for the outline of the body and the user would be able to move the phone or have the subject move until they closely fit into the shape seen above. Once in position the subject would be photographed and the resulting photo WOULD NOT display the outline above. It is used for targeting and alignment only. Once photo is taken a set of clothing could be held up and the same outline above could be used to align the clothes within the shape and photographed thus allowing the two photos to be merged and the subject would see what the clothing would look like on them. Application would then eliminate all of the image out side the body image. In more specific terms would isolate the subject from the subjects surroundings. The result would be the subject alone in a blank field. Now that subject is isolated application would allow for other images to be placed over subject image. example new clothes could be imaged in a similar manner as the subject and dragged on to the isolated image.p  pok thanks for your answer.it really helps me alot..p  pnow tell me if these functions are possiblep  pApplication will allow for adding isolated subject onto a background imaged stored on the iphone. example subject is photographed in San Francisco but background is replaced to make it appear subject is in New York City. All functions described above should be available to be employed with stored images as well. Image of subject should be able to be morphed to appear heavier or thinner.p  pBelow are some additional desired features which are price sensitive  please provide an estimate based on adding some of these features. If a feature is listed below and it appears above please disregard. Once photo is taken, app would ask user if they want to cut the head, replace the outfit or try on. This would drive the subsequent actions. If cut head is selected User would circle the outline of the head and the app would cut out the image of the head and save to the side User would then select another body from the picture,from a body template, or body from another savedstored photo. Once body is selected, user would touch the saved head and it will automatically fill on to the body. If outfit is selected User would touch key body parts such as the two shoulders, hands, waist, legs and feet from left to right. This would allow the app to know how best to superimpose the outfit. User would then select an outfit from the many available templates Once selected, user would hit a confirm type of button and this would put the new outfit on to the body. The outfit should conform to the persons body in the photo. i.e. stretch side ways to make the person fatter, make thinner, shorter, longer, etc.  If app could be aware of spatial alignment, that would be ideal. i.e. if someone is turned to the side, the replaced outfit would be a side view.  Another feature should be is for the user to manually alter the photo with the new outfit to make the person look taller, shorter, skinnier, fatter, etc.  App would also have option pose for frontal and rear view photo  In the camera view when this option is selected, a standard body outline would show in the frame. The user would try and match as closely as possibly the subject to the body outline shown in the frame. Once closely matched, user would take the phone of the frontal and rear view of the subject.  At clothing stores, the user can take a front and back photo of the clothes and have it superimposed to the posed photo of the body they took.  User would open the app, and it would start as outlined in the first bullet point above User would select the camera option User would take the photo of the front and back of the clothing Once photo taken, app would ask if they want to cut the head, replace the outfit, or try on.. User selects try on App asks if its a top, bottom, or both AND if user wants frontalrear view of the clothing User touches key points of the outfit as needed, ie.shoulders, wrist, waist, etc. Once key points touched and confirmed, app automatically fits the clothing into the savedposed photo App would need to conform the clothing photo to the users body shape and type. The app should work for saved pictures as well. ie stores have pictures online and the user is able to copy and save the clothing photo from the stores website to their iphone and use this feature the same.p

Negative 74354 pOK, this one is a puzzler. There is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1116121weirduitableviewbehaviorafterscrollingandinsertingnewrowone similar posta but its not similar enough to count, so Im posting this one. p  pIve got a grouped strongUITableViewstrong with a header and footer. The footer includes two strongUIButtonstrong views, sidebyside. Nothing major.p  pNow  there is a toggle button in a strongUIToolbarstrong at the bottom for moreless info in this table view. So I build my index paths to deleteinsert with fade row animation, all the usual ingredients, sandwiched between codebeginUpdatescode and codeendUpdatescode calls on the strongUITableViewstrong  and this works fine In also happens that my footer can sometimes be pushed off past the bottom of the display.p  pHeres where it gets weird. If I drag my finger up the display, scrolling the view upward, I should see that footer eventually, rightp  pWell  most of the time I do. BUT, if I flick my finger up, for a faster scroll, the footer is emmissingem. Even if you try to tap in that area  no response.p  pHowever, if I scroll back down again, just to hide that footer or rather hide the area where the footer would normally be, and then scroll back up, its there once againp  pThis only happens when eminsertingem rows. If I delete rows, the footer stays put  unless of course it was already hidden and I didnt perform the aforementioned incantation to get it back. codecodep  pI am trying to trace through this, but to no avail. I suppose tracing through scroll operations is a bit of a crazy proposition Perhaps some creative logging  suggestions, anyone Or is this a known issue in 3.1 where row insertdeletes are concerned I dont recall seeing it until 3.1.p

Negative 74354 pIm trying to get my head around Cappuccino. Id like my StackOverview peers to review the architecture below and see if it makes sense  the aim is to utilize the unique benefits of Django and Cappuccino without doubling up where the technologies overlap...p  pWhen the web browser requests a friendly URL eg, , articles, etcp  ul liDJangos urls.py matches this to a view. li liThe view, rather than doing DJangos typical work of filling in a template with the locals dict,br  returns the small stub HTML used in a Cappuccino app directly.   li liThe client receives the Cappuccino HTMLli liThe client requests the Objective J JS URLs mentioned in the stub HTMLli liThe enduser app is executed and displayed in the browserli ul  pThe browser now has a working app. When the user does something that    requests something from the serverp  ul liThe browser sends an XMLHTTPRequest to a URL.li liDjangos URLs.py matches this to a view. li liThe view does it work, perhaps interacting with the DB model. But instead of returning a template, Django returns some JSON.li liThe client recieves the JSON, and does whatever it needs to do.li ul  pDoes this make sense We still have the benefit of friendly URLs, and the database being created for us to model our code. However rather than using templates, were providing Cappuccino stub pages and JSON responses, in order to give users something more like a real app and less like an HTML templating engine. p  pIs there perhaps a better way of doing things What do other Pythonistas use Thanks for your feedback.p

Negative 74354 pInspired by the DDD hype, I designed my classes pretending there was no database at all. And then used NHibernate to map the classes to database tables. Part of my class graph look like this Order hasmany Product belongstoSeller. To retrieve all orders placed for a certain seller. I have the codep  precodepublic class OrderActiveRecordBaseltOrdergt      [HasMany]     public ICollectionltProductgt Itemsgetset     ...   public class Product OrderActiveRecordBaseltProductgt      [BelongsTo]     public Seller Sellerget set      ...   public class OrderRepositoryIOrderRepository      public IQuerableltOrdergt GetOrdersBySellerIdint sellerId              return Order.FindAll.AsQuerable.Wherexgtx.Items.Count gt 0 ampamp                                                    x.Items.First.Seller.SellerID  sellerId.AsQuerable        codepre  pNot pretty, but it worked with my unit tests. I was happy until we started to inject real data into database. The performance is so bad that I want to vomit. So, I did a little investigation for my repository code. Not surprisedly, in order to find the orders I want, I had to get All data from Order table, and All data from Product table and some data from Seller table. p  pSo, here comes my problem. As a total dummy in database area, I dont know how to improve my repository code even though I know it stinks badly. So, I am tempted to modify my Order class to have a reference to Seller class, so that I can use hql to add a Where clause to improve the performance. But modifying class structure due to database problem seems to be violating the DDD principles. p  pWhat is your suggestion,especially in improving my repository code I have tried Linq for ActiveRecord and hql. But couldnt get them to work.p

Negative 74354 pTechnical summary Im developing a Java web service deployed on GlassFish v3, running on CentOS 5.p  pMy web service uses functionality provided by a native library .so . The native library works fine, however I am not having much luck in configuring the environment correctly bto load the native library yet not be affected by web app redeployment, without restart the app server.b p  pWhat Ive done so far isp  pInitially I loaded the library static System.loadpathtolibabc.so in the web service code, all paths set correctly, and it works fine, until I redeploy the application and it complains that the library is loaded by another ClassLoader. I found out that native libs are only loaded once.p  pTo try and solve this I then removed the libraryloading code from the web application, created a Singleton class, wrapped it into a Lifecyle module, deployed it to GlassFish shared lib folder and then configured GlassFish to run the wrapper when it starts up. The idea being that now all web applications would be able to reference it since it is not tied to one particular web app and loaded by a ClassLoader higher in the hierarchy. p  pWhen GlassFish starts up the native library is loaded successfully  linux lsof  grep libabc.so . However, the web service code fails with a UnsatisfiedLinkError when executing the native method in my web service Java code. It seems to me that code in the web application does not have access to the library loaded at startup.p  pCan anyone tell me what Im doing wrong p  pThanks in advance.p

This is usually a great behaviour because it means you dont need to restart your localhost server when you make a code change.p  pHowever, this also clears out my initialised codethevariablecode variable, and when the next request comes in the initialiser obviously isnt run again.

Negative 74354 pmy layouts requirement is to keep all thumbnails at 80px height, not higher, not smaller. In my model I set the style to codethumbgt 500x80gtcode, so basically almost every picture which is not too wide gets its perfect miniature with 80px height. Sometimes, however, my pictures are narrow and high, so the thumb can have unclickable dimensions of like 5x80.

However, I fear maintenance issues due to includingremoving parent containers that would cause the ID to change.p  p1C User Client ID  Static. p  pI could choose static IDs for the controls such that I minimize the likelihood of a clash with auto generated IDs perhaps by prefixing the ID with StaticID  and use an external stylesheet with ID selectors.p  p2 I could place the style right on the control. The only disadvantage here, as I see it, is that style info is brought down each time instead of being cached , which is what Id get using an external CSS.

But I never see my error messages  Things are going badly never shows up in the debug error page.  p  pIt seems they should show up as the codeException Valuecode on the error page.  I walked back through the django source far enough to find out that this is the codevaluecode field from codesys.excinfocode which is consistently tersely documented as [the exceptions] associated value or the second argument to raise, which is always a class instance if the exception type is a class object.  Unfortunately, I dont know what to do with this information.p  pSo my question is How should I be writing and raising my custom exceptions to get more useful data to show up in places like the django error screenp

Negative 74354 pSo Im trying to speed up our applications startup times  and Ive identified a major bottleneck to work on.  Each of our webservice client classes takes forever and a day to instantiate.  Some investigation revealed this is entirely due to the SoapHttpClientProtocol running GenerateXMLMappings.  I started searching for information on this and found this SO post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions172095slowsoaphttpclientprotocolconstructorhttpstackoverflow.comquestions172095slowsoaphttpclientprotocolconstructorap  pI was ready to sound the trumpets since my issues mirrored what was talked about there to the letter.  I went through every step listed in the first post to use sgen to pregenerate a serializer dll, and then removed the various tags from the code and built that into a normal dll which I referenced in the applciation as a normal reference as opposed to a web reference.  However after all this, I dont see any difference when profiling the application.  Tons of time is still soaked up doing GenerateXMLMappings as part of the SoapHttpClientProtocol  constructor.p  pI have verified that it is in fact using my custom webservice client dll.  I have also verified that it is at least looking for the XmlSerializers dll if I do not include the file I can see a filenotfound is spit up about it.  p  pDoes anyone have detailed info about how the SoapHttpClientProtocol constructor decides what it needs to do  This is a really frustrating problem because the whole process seems to be blackboxed with no good way to see what is actually going on internally.  p  pThanks in advance for any help  Im completely against a wall on this one.p

Negative 74354 pIve finished my NPAPI plugin and it works great in Google Chrome but theres a strange problem. The problem is that Ive coded a method in the plugin that returns a string to the browser. In order to do so, you have to allocate a memory in the browser and copy the resulting string to it. Something likep  precodebool ScriptablePluginObjectInvokeNPIdentifier name, const NPVariant args,                                uint32t argCount, NPVariant result      if name  sMethodid    ...    free the memory if it is already allocated   if mpPtr NPNMemFreempPtr    allocate the string in the browser memory   mpPtr  charNPNMemAllocsize1   SecureZeroMemorympPtr, size1   memcpympATR, string, size    send result to browser   STRINGZTONPVARIANTmpPtr, result    return true     ...   codepre  pNote that mpPtr is a data member of the class and is initialized to NULL upon construction. The problem occurs when I call this method twice from Google Chrome. The first time it works great. From the second time and so on, it returns a garbage value displayed X in the browser.

Negative 74354 pBasically Ive wrote my own parser and Im parsing a string into and expression and then compiling and storing to be reused later on.p  pFor an odd example the type of string Im parsing is thisp  precodeif name  max and legs gt 5 and ears gt 5 then shoot codepre  pThe hash parts in the string are telling my parser to look at the properties on the object of type T that I pass in, if not found to look in a Dictionary that also gets passed in as extra.p  pI parse up the string into parts create an expression and join the expressions using methods from the PredicateBuilder.p  pI get the left value from where ever it may be and then the right value and turn it into an int32 or a string based on if its wrapped in single quotes.. for now, then pass both into Expression.EqualsExpression.GreaterThan etc. dependant on the operator.p  pSo far this works fine for equals and strings but take for example ears which isnt a property on the object but is in the dictionary I end up with does string equal int32 and it throws an exception.p  pI need to be able to parse the string from the dictionary into and int32 and then try the equalgreaterless than method.p

Negative 74354 pHello Ive got the following scenario WPF Treeview displaying custom objects, each of them containing a list of children. So the problem is Each of the custom objects is controlled by a combobox that can change the current object from Class A to Class BCD and vice versa. Classes AD are all subclasses of a superclass. So far so good. Each class should be represented by a specific Datatemplate in the WPF treeview, so each time, the user changes the object class using the inlinecombo the item should get a new template applied. So far Ive tried 1. DataTemplate Selector Class gets only applied at start 2. nulling DatatemplateSelector in treeview and reappling it after object change too slow 3. Datatemplate by class xType works, but I need three different Templates per Object, one graphic, one minimum, one maximum display width with additional TextBlocks 4. Datatrigger I do not know how to databind it to the changed Classp  pMight be some kind of systematic mistake. Your help is appreciated very muchp  pGreetsp  pMarkusp

Negative 74354 pIm currently designing an application for iOS using MonoTouch that will have a server component running on Windows Azure. The application will essentially be a chat type application where users will generate messages within their clients and send them to the server, which will then need to forward those messages out as quickly as practicable to other clients that the user might be sending the messages to.p  pMy question is  is there a recommended practice for architecting an application like this, where clients need to receive push messages from the serverp  pIve considered a few options but would appreciate feedback.p  ul lipThe first option is to use Apples Push Notifications service APNs. I have two concerns about this  first, the clients only need to receive the messages when theyre online APNs sends messages through when the app is closed too, which I dont need or want and second, there is a possibility that there will be a high volume of messages, which I know Apple would probably get unhappy about perfectly fairly.pli lipA second option I considered is using a web service WCFbased and having the client call this service every say 23 seconds, which is the maximum delay we could tolerate. This would seem to involve a great deal of potentially unnecessary network traffic, though have you got anything for me, no, repeated ad nauseum.pli lipA third option is to maintain a persistent web service connection between the client and the server. When the client app starts it would call a web service method on a background thread. The server would hold the connection open by not returning anything, and if any messages came through it would immediately return them. This connection might time out after, say, 2 minutes at which point it would be reestablished. This seems to do what I want, but again, Im concerned that thered be a lot of connections open to the server at any moment, which could require server resources unnecessarily.pli lipA fourth option is to use a persistent connection over TCP or UDP, although from what Ive found, Windows Azure doesnt support this. This seems to be a good option, but again, might be overkill in terms of server usage  there could potentially be hundreds or even thousands of clients connected at any moment.pli lipA fifth option is to somehow have the server push messages directly to the client, perhaps by having the client run a mini web server or similar. However, as the app will be running on 3G and WiFi networks beyond my control I dont expect incoming ports will be open for this sort of thing.pli ul  pIf anyone has any other suggestions, or thinks one of the above options would be a good idea or is a standard way of approaching this sort of problem Id be very interested to hear about it.p  pThanks in advance,p  pJohnp

Negative 74354 pIm using the Script library with ASP.NET. I want to listen and respond to the onBeforeUnload browser event. p  pI am currently intercepting the event like thisp  precodeWindow.AttachEvent onbeforeunload, OnNavigateAway  ... private void OnNavigateAway      Script.AlertYoure leaving.  codepre  pBut the second parameter to Window.AttachEvent is a DOMEventHandler, which has a return type of void. To use the onBeforeUnload event, I need to be able to return a string value, which the browser uses as the confirmation message.p  pIs there any way to do this without emitting a script literal or hand coding javascript I would really prefer to stay in the compiled C  javascript as much as possible.p  pIn case it matters, Im using version 0.5.5 of the Script library, which isnt the latest version, but I am restricted to this for now.p  hr  pUPDATE DuckMaestro answered my question perfectly, but it still didnt work for me. It is the correct answer to my question in that the compiled Javascript is exactly what I was expecting and wanting. But it doesnt have the desired effect of causing the browser to issue a warning prompt. p  pI do have a workaround, though, in case someone else stumbles across this answer and wants to know how I initially hacked it into working. Instead of thisp  precodepublic delegate string BeforeUnloadDelegate ... Window.AttachEvent onbeforeunload, DOMEventHandler Object      new BeforeUnloadDelegateOnNavigateAway  codepre  pI did thisp  precodeScript.Literal window.onbeforeunload  this.onNavigateAway  codepre  pThis is bad form for a number of reasons. This will only work on the .debug.js class that Script generates Script changes the names in the release version, so the script emitted by the Script.Literal statement wont match up. Also, it negates a lot of the benefits of using Script in the first place. For example, using Visual Studios refactoring tools to rename OnNavigateAway to something else will leave an orphaned reference in the string. Also, the C code declares the method as OnNavigateAway, whereas the Script.Literal has to refer to this.onNavigateAway. p  pStill, if, like me, youre on a deadline and looking for a hack, this is a place to start. If I make any more progress on a more correct version, Ill update this question with the details.p  pThanks again to DuckMaestro for answering the question I asked.p
Negative 74354 pIm wondering which is the best way to pass NSManagedObjectContext in IOS Application.

Negative 74354 pI have a Java project being tested with JUnit mix of Junit 3 and 4 style, where the classes under test might log a log4j error.  I would like to make a unit test fail if such an error is logged.p  pIs there a generic way to configure either log4j or the unit test infrastructure to make any call to a log4j error method in the code under test throw a runtime exception and therefore fail the test  AOP might be one way, but Im interested in other possibilities too.p  pThe intention here is to weed out places in code where log4j error is being used incorrectly.

Negative 74354 pPlease reference this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netFcznp relnofollowexamplea with the following explanationp  pI have a web page with an extrawide, centered background image.  I want the body width of the page to collapse to the content, and ignore the div that contains the background.  In the given example, I have a simplified example of how I do this An bgouter div establishes the proper page width 200px wide, and an bginner div 400px wide contains the extrawide image.  I then use overflowvisible and negative margins to attempt to center the wider bginner without increasing the page width.  However, as the example shows, horizontal scrollbars appear when the browser window is less than 400px, not 200px.

Negative 74354 pIm currently developing an application in HTMLJS based almost entirely in ajax connections using the codejQuery.ajaxcode call to ease the process.p  pI was thinking about the best practice to make secure calls without using HTTPS at least at this time. I cant afford paying for a certificate right now.p  pAt this point, the only thing that concerns me is the registration and login steps. Maybe the login is a bit easier. I thought of strongsending the username and a timestamp, and then encrypt them using the users password.strong So, by doing this, I wouldnt be sending any password keeping as a secret like in OAuth. The server should check the user, decrypt using the password and pairing the recieved timestamp with the decrypted result. The server should keep the emnonceemlike number into a database to avoid repetition attacks and then give back to the user another unique id encrypted with the users password. At that point the user should start using that key to encrypt all his information and probably another nonce and send it to the server. Please correct me if you find any mistake or leak.p  pThe very big problem to me is the registration. I cant encrypt with a regular password the information, because if I do that in the javascript, any could know the password. If I serve temporary generated passwords to encrypt and I send it from the server to the client, any sniffer could get it and use to decrypt the info.p  pI know HTTPS could save my life at this point and maybe thats the only solution, but at this point Im not able to use it.p  pIs there any other solution, or should I wait until I can use HTTPS Bear in mind that if I could skip the wait, it would be better. Thanks matesp

Negative 74354 pI have an application that binds two ports 6961 and 6963. It is an application of the form clientserverclient where one client controls the other.p  pThe application is working great, but after a seemingly random amount of accepted and closed connections, the server refuses to receive or send data thru the sockets. I can make the connection with codetelnetcode, but when I type something, I dont get back a response.p  pI have had times the server accepted up to 370 connections until it refused working, but last time it only accepted 70 connections.p  pI dont think it has to do with the closing of the sockets, which I think I do properly.

Negative 74354 pI recently did studying stuff and meet up with Donald Knuth. But i didnt found the right algorithm to my problem.p  pstrongThe Problemstrong We have a league with n players. every week they have a match with one other. in n1 weeks every team fought against each other. there are n2 matches a day. but one team can only fight once in a week. if we generate an nk combination we get all of the combinations... assuming k  2 but i need to bring them in the right order. p  pMy first suggestion was... not the best one. i just made an array, and then let the computer try if he finds the right way. if not, go back to the start, shuffle the array and do it again, well, i programmed it in PHP n8 and what comes out works, but take many time, and for n16 it gives me a timeout as well.p  pSo i thought if maybe we find an algorithm, or anybody knows a book which covers this problem.p  pAnd heres my code  a hrefhttppastebin.comRfm4TquYhttppastebin.comRfm4TquYap
Negative 74354 pI have a system using Entity Framework that is deployed in various production systems and also on a quality control system. My problem is that data entry is often done only on one of those occurrences of my system different databases.p  pI want to find the best way to transfer my data from one database to another database. Ids can change, as long as the relations between my objects are maintained. 98 of my data in in DB, some of it is external files, I can manage those separately, manually.p  pCurrently we use a xml structure as a transition file. The file is then imported in the destination system, and code manually imports the entities and recreates the data.p  pIm looking for a more generic way to do this, with less code. Since all my data in stored in Entities couldnt I simply create a big List and throw all my objects in there, then serialize that in some matter into an external file and finally generically import all the entities in there in my destination system Ill probably have to be careful in maintaining relation ids, but should be ok...p  pAnyways Im wondering if anyone would have smart approaches, Im pretty sure I,m not the first with a similar problem.p  pThanksp

Negative 74354 pI am developing an application that sends a stream of JPEG images MJPEG stream to a remote PC. I am having trouble changing the preview frame rate in the camera parameters. It seems that no matter what rate I set, the camera only gives me a frame at 15 fps. At first I thought it was due to image compression and then transmitting the data. But I created a debug instance where I store the first compressed JPEG image and send that image every time the onPreviewFrame function is called. That results in a reliable 15fps, but I have it set at 30fps. Anyone have any ideas of why the fps is so inconsistent When I set it up to compress every preview frame and send out over wifi I get a rate of 540 FPS and it jumps all over the place.p  pHere is of my code for my Preview sets up camera in full screenp  precodepublic class Preview extends SurfaceView implements PreviewCallback, SurfaceHolder.Callback  SurfaceHolder mHolder Camera mCamera DatagramSocket udpSocket  null final int PORT  1235 final String IPAddress  192.168.1.101 int packetSize  1024  Specify max size of each UDP packet int WIDTH  640 int HEIGHT  480    int FPS  30        int quality  70    Initialize the Camera Preview Holder and create a udpSocket.   param context   PreviewContext context      supercontext     mHolder  getHolder     mHolder.addCallbackthis     mHolder.setTypeSurfaceHolder.SURFACETYPEPUSHBUFFERS     try          udpSocket  new DatagramSocket      catch SocketException e          Log.etag, Error creating UDP Socket       public void surfaceCreatedSurfaceHolder holder      mCamera  Camera.open     try         mCamera.setPreviewDisplayholder      catch IOException exception          mCamera.release         mCamera  null         Log.etag, Error settign Camera Preview Holder       public void surfaceDestroyedSurfaceHolder holder      mCamera.setPreviewCallbacknull     mCamera.stopPreview     udpSocket.close     mCamera.release     udpSocket  null     mCamera  null  public void surfaceChangedSurfaceHolder holder, int format, int w, int h      Camera.Parameters parameters  mCamera.getParameters     parameters.setPreviewSizeWIDTH, HEIGHT     parameters.setPreviewFrameRateFPS     parameters.setRotation90      mCamera.setParametersparameters     mCamera.setPreviewCallbackthis     mCamera.startPreview   Compresses the preview framer data into a JPEG image and send to a host at   the specified IPAddress and Port number for playback.

Negative 74354 pIve encountered a weird issue that has gotten me stumped for a few days now.  First some background infop  pI have an activity that binds to a third party service given to me as a library.  This service sends asynchronous callbacks to the client my activity whenever the client requests an action be performed.  The service is never started with startService and stopService calls I  perform bind when i need the servcie and unbind when I am done.  I never have more than one activity bound to the service at any one time.p  pMy issuep  pThe user starts my activity lets call it instance A.  I bind to the service in onCreate and issue a request.  I receive a callback from the service and set some local variables accordingly.  Once i go through what i need to do, i call finish.  onDestroy gets called and i then perform un bind service.  My assumption at this point is that both the Service instance and my activity should not be able to be referenced any more.p  pNow, after A has finished, the user starts my activty again lets call this instance B.  I again bind in onCreate and issue a request.  However when i receive a callback, i notice that the service has issued a callback to my old ghost instance A.  I am now using all of instance As local variables instead of using This new instance B.  I even printed out the this reference before binding and again after receiving the callback and was able to see that the reference changes from instance Bs to instance As.  Execution in my activity continues to proceed, but since my local variables are now set incorrectly to their old state at the end of As execution, Bs execution fails.p  pSo a few questionsp  ol liHow is it possible that A is still being referenced after onDestroy and unbind is called   li liIs it likely that this issue could be related to the third party service and not my implementation again, I dont have the source code to this service, im just using itli ol  pThanks for any insights you all can offer.p  pJasonp

Negative 74354 pHello all I am using a jQuery uploader called uploadify which uploads multiple files to a server using javascript by having a flash multipicker for your hardrive.  This makes it easy to grab a bunch of files all at once instead of one at a time.  I have a problem. It would call the same script using ajax to upload the files individually even though you selected multiple items.  This would allow me to write a php function in a controller that I named upload to upload that file. p  pI would like to be able to allow a user to upload all their files during their sign up process.  The problem is that Im new to codeigniter and want to use the file upload class but as far as I know you cant find out what type of file it is before you make the upload.  Only afterwards you can find out if it is an image or not.  The reason for doing this is because I am putting them all in separate folders.  One for videos one for music and one for images.p  pI thought another way around this was to create a seperate upload field for each type of upload and just call a differenct ajax script.  This is actually what I would prefer to do but there is another problem.  I know that codeigniter uses the nameuserfile to do the upload and I need three uploader fields on my page with different names on them.  Can you have multiple upload fields per page with code igniter. p  pIf someone could help me out with this I would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 74354 pIts well known that Python classes cannot have emtrulyem private members. The notemasemobvious implication of this is that Java classes privates are made public to Jython. Hide thy nakedness, Javap  pSo, when using Jython, and accessing a Java classes privates that would usually be exposed to other Java classes through getters and setters, do you bother to use those methods Or do you just access the privates directlyp  pThe more pertinent question would be, strongshouldstrong you use the getters and setters If there are sideeffects of the methods, then the answer would undoubtedly be yes, but if the methods are just there because someone thought that a putting getters and setters everywhere is The Right Thing to do IMO its not, just make the damn thing public, then is there any reason to bother with all of Javas extra ceremonyp
Negative 74354 pIm trying to create an android project that contains shared code which will be used by others. In this project I only have POJO and no android specific classes.p  pSome of the functionality requires calling some activities and is depended on the result. My POJO classes get reference to the calling activity when used, but thats happening at run time and I have no control over the implementation of those activities.p  pMy problem is that with the reference of the calling activity I can emstartActivityForResultem but I have no way of adding the emonActivityResultem, which might exists in the calling activity but is not aware of the requestCode I used.p  pMy question then is how do I know, from within a regular java object when the activity has returned  since, as far as I understand I can only implement emonActivityResultem on Activity classes.p  pthanksp

Negative 74354 pI just stumbled upon some serialization issues in a recent project. While there are some common mistakes like beans residing in view scope without implementing codeSerializablecode there are some more sophisticated issues, that I dont have an answer for right now. p  p1 How to deal with codeManagedPropertycode when the injected instance is not serializable In this case a certain service implemented as singleton codeSpringcode bean is injected. While I could mark the attribute codetransientcodethis would leave the attribute with codenullcode upon deserialization of the managed bean. Another, rather unesthetic, approach is to omit the attribute und do a lookup when the service is needed probabyl encapsuled in the codegetServicecode method. While there is an approach for codeSpringcode beans using scoped proxies, Im unsure how this problem should be solved when codeSpringcode is not used or another nonSpring bean with longer lived scope than Request is injected. p  p2 During inspection of the codeViewMapcode I noticed that it is sometimes not serializable because of some codeMojarracode builtin classes that are not Serializable by default, e.g.codejavax.faces.view.facelets.ConverterHandlercode. I dont understand why this was put by codeMojarracode in the codeViewMapcode anyway. p  p3 With observations made in 2  Is it necessary for the ViewMap to be Serializable with standard Java serialization methods From my understanding, everything that ends up in a codeHttpSessioncodeneeds to be serializable but maybe there is some hidden serialization trick applied by codeMojarracode that Im not aware of.p  p4 Deserialization seems never to happen except if codecom.sun.faces.serializeServerStatecode is set. I put codeprivate void writeObjectObjectOutputStream out throws IOExceptioncode and codeprivate void readObjectObjectInputStream in throws IOException, ClassNotFoundExceptioncodein a codeViewScopedcodebean to see how serialization happens. But interestingly, while codewriteObjectcode   is called upon completion of the Lifecycle, codereadObjectcodeis never called, except if the codecontextparamcodementioned above is set. This leads to the question why Objects are beeing serialized when they will never be deserialized.p  pThis observations were made with Mojarra 2.1.6 on Tomcat 7.0.11.p  pIt would be great if someone with more insights coulds shed some light on this.p  pThxp

Negative 74354 pIve been building PHP tools with a MySQL backend.  Using multicurl I can run dozens and sometimes hundreds of each script concurrently on just one old PC that now run the latest Ubuntu desktop.  Each machine and each VM on each machine is capable of running dozens of concurrent instances.p  pAs a result I rapidly run out of MySQL connections.  When I upped the number of connections in MySQL I froze the quadcore machine I was using to host the MySQL server.  Since then Ive moved on to a scheme where I have a DB specific for managing requests of other DBs and using cron jobs that run for hours I maintain a few open connections per machine.  At this point Im still in the light testing phase and I havent attempted to make hundreds of simultaneous requests to see how the MySQL server handles it.p  pInstead Ive run into another issue that Ive tried several solutions for all with approx the same results.  The issue is that of duplicate data being entered into the DB because I have concurrent instances of the tool running on different machines.  For example, I feed a big chunk of new data into my DB and that data needs to have a few tasks performed on it such as linking an email address to a user profile.  Ive chosen to have a background cron process handle this a little at a time and each machine does its share every 5 minutes.  Since they all start at the same time they all grab the same email data and filter it using the same logic about which email addresses are higher priority.  Then each machine begins to do what needs to be done with the emails it picked.  Since they all kick off at the same time they frequently appear to grab the exact same data and attempt to do the same linkings.  This causes a primary key exception in the linkage table but not some of the others.  So I end up with duplicate data in some tables and occasionally incomplete linkage.p  pIve tried randomizing the SELECT data so the machines are working on different data sets.  However, this is of course suboptimal with respect to what Id like the tool to accomplish so I need to run the tool more often in order for certain tasks to get completed in the desired time frame.  Ive tried creating a flag in the DB that designates 1 server is actively using the data so all other servers should wait.  This works sometimes but sometimes 2 machines are polling that flag at the same time.  Since we are talking multiple machines I dont flock will work.  And from what Ive read locking the table in the DB may not be a good solution either.p  pSo Ive come to StackOverflow for advice rather than continuing to beat my head against a wall.p  p Update p  pGearman looked like a great solution so I gave it the thumbs up as the answer.  However, I was never able to get it working with my PHP install.  I attempted several sets of suggestionsinstructions online many of which never even got gearman installed.  The suggestion of using aptget install gearmanserver did get gearman installed as far as I could tell  i.e. no errors were generated and gearmand would run.  However, when I attempted to use gearman clients and workers in scripts I would get errors regarding not being able to find those classes.p  pAfter that I added a gearman.ini file to the correct directory.  It had 1 line codeextensiongearman.socode.  This lead to a different error where PHP told me it couldnt find gearman.so.  I attempted to use codesudo find  name gearman.code to find gearman.so with no luck  it returned C files but not gearman.so.p  pAt this time Id really, really, really like to implement gearman but since I cant get it to work Im stuck with my hack and slash PHP code for implementing my distributed toolset.  My solution to date is to create a flag that it set to OCCUPIED when 1 instance of the tool is doing something that would cause duplicate data issues.  I have created 5 of the same flag with postfixes of 1, 2, ... so that 5 instances can run concurrently.  I use the 1, 2, ... to create an offset into the returned DB data so that no 2 tool instances are working on the same data set.  In other words, if a SELECT statement would return 100 rows and I only work on 10 at a time then 1 works on rows 110, 2 works on 1120, ...  Not ideal but it should allow multiple servers to operate on the DB simultaneously without duplicate data being created.p  pThe DB API tool timeouts if it doesnt see a result in 30 sec.  The problem now is frequent timeouts when attempting to grab those flag states...p

Its not tied to a location in the filesystem, apart from where the .ppw file which stores the workspace meta information is stored.li listrongSimilarly why are projects tied to a particular folderstrong In PHPEd a project is not tied to a particular location in the filesystem. Yes, the project has a root folder defined, but its simply a property of the project. This means there are no project related files metafiles cluttering the filestructure of the project source files. Can Aptana be made to behave in this wayli listrongConnectionsstrong  The connections are similar, but the way projects reference them is not. In PHPEd I have a connection for each remote server I use. Then in a project I can specify a remote root folder relative to the connection  this allows me to have one connection used by multiple projects if they are all published on the same remote server. Can Aptana behave like this Or do I have to define a separate connection for each projectli lipstrongWhat is the best way to create a project from an existing sourcestrong I like my local file structure to mirror the filestructure on my host machine. This allows for easy moving of folders, easy synchronisation, allows me to syncronise browsing in Filezilla etc. So my work directory will look something like thisp  precodewww     devhtml         development lt this is the root of a development subdomain         test lt this is the root of the last build being tested in the test subdomain     intrahtml lt contains the root folders of various intranet subdomains         crm         kb     publichtml  lt this is the live site codepre  pNow, I really dont want to point Aptana at these folders and have it add its metafolders, but I dont want to have Aptana replicate these folders  introducing another shard. How can I create projects that point to these existing files I know this is related to my second question, but is there a way to have Aptana keep these local files uptodate if it has to replicate them locallypli lipWhat is the best way to integrate with git if I want to be able to easily upload to the remote host PHPEd handled this with a simple keyboard shortcut  CtrlShiftS  which would upload to the remote server immediately, but there was no support for git. I have a remote repository bitbucket which is separate from my remote host. I was hoping git integration would make it easy to have both immediate upload to my development environment, as well as the ability to easily commit once everything is working as I want. pli ol  pPart of my issue is that the terminology in Aptana is not really intuitive to me, coming from PHPEd and is not very well explained. If I want to add a framework folder for code autocompletion, is that an External Directory under the PHP Buildpath tab And what is the PHP buildpath p  pIn summary, I want to have a local file structure that mirrors the hosting file structure, I want to be able to very easily syncronise local files to the host, and I want to be able to easily stage and then commit those files I haveedited once I have tested them on the host. Is all this possible with Aptana Or do I need to go through the massive pain of integrating git with PHPEdp

Negative 74354 pI would like to use ASP.NET MVC 4 to build a web site that will target both desktop and mobile users will leave tablets to one side for this discussionp  pThere appears to be a number of options available to me and I would like to obtain some feedback.p  pThe first option involves using the same web site for both desktop and mobile users.  Each page request would go to the respective controller and would render a view dependent on the form factor and maybe even dependent on the device type, e.g. Windows Phone, IPhone, etc.  Responsive design would be used top ensure that the UI was suitably tailored to the expected user experience portrait, landscape.  This option has the following benefits as I see itp  ul liNo duplication of controller logicli liSingle site to maintainli lino redirect for the user to a different siteli lino duplication of pages to inform the search crawler aboutli ul  pThe second option involves having a separate site for mobile which only provides views and controller action methods for mobile.  This would also have the ability to provide device specific views using display modes and responsive design for orientation.  This option has the following benefitsp  ul liFull controll over the mobile experience in terms of what pages are available I know that I could conditional render action links but with this option, if functionality is not permitted on the device, a page doesnt exist in the siteli liSeparate release cycles for mobile.li liBut the biggest drawback is the fact that controller logic will almost certainly be duplicated between the desktop site and the mobile site which feels like it will really hurt in the future.li ul  pIt feels like the purist MVC should have the controller which should obtain the data and then provide a view which allows the data to be surfaced on the most appropriate page.  This feels like option 1.p  pI guess it comes down to should we have a device specific site httpm. or do we design a site that can be viewed from an array of devicesp  pThoughtsp

Negative 74354 pIn several of websites I maintaindevelop we use worldpay as the payment gateway. We have people experiencing strange problems with it. So I tried logging some stuff and the logging I implemented does not quite work.p  pThe problem that users experience is that they are supposed to be redirected to worldpay website, so magento plugin generates a simple form with hidden fields. Then on page load event it submits the form. Form action url is set to worldpay url. So its basicaly a post request with order info being sent to worldpay.p  pNow for some people, and this happens on a daily basis the worldpay gateway never loads. They are stuck on a page with hidden form that says please standby while we redirect you. We had people wait for several minutes before actually being redirected.p  pI decided to start logging various stuff from that form whenever the user spends more than 3 seconds on it. So I turned to javascript this is what I have donep  precodeltbody onloadjavascriptdocument.worldpaycheckout.submitgt codepre  pThen I have these linesp  precodefunction timerFunction     var dataObj       for var i  document.worldpaycheckout.elements.length  1 i gt 0 i         dataObj[document.worldpaycheckout.elements[i].name]  document.worldpaycheckout.elements[i].value          dataObj[BrowserCodeName]  navigator.appCodeName     dataObj[BrowserName]  navigator.appName     dataObj[BrowserVersion]  navigator.appVersion     dataObj[CookiesEnabled]  navigator.cookieEnabled     dataObj[Platform]  navigator.platform     dataObj[UserAgentHeader]  navigator.userAgent     .postworldpaylogworldpaylog.php, dataObj, functiondata          document.worldpaycheckout.submit         intervalId  self.setIntervaltimerFunction,5000          self.clearIntervalintervalId   var intervalId  self.setIntervaltimerFunction,3000 codepre  pWhat I try to do is get the form elements and some browser info and log that on the server by making an ajax post request if more than 3 seconds have passed. Then I resubmit the form. It looks pretty straight forward to me yet there are still a lot of ppl. who do not get to worldpay and are not logged by the script. Could it be that on some browsers javascript is not reliable after submitting a form before the browser starts expecting a new page load or whatever.p  pAlso, there is a minified jquery framework with just the components needed for ajax function to work on that page. I found it on github out of desperation thinking what I wrote before did not work on all browsers. But its all the same.p  pDoes anyone have any hints on what I should do here Maybe an idea on different approach to logging this data or somethingp

Negative 74354 pI want to know if it is a good idea to access shared data from a signal handler. I mean consider the scenario of multi process system and multithreaded system with a single process. In multi process system, lets say I have the processes handle a particular signal and update certain shared variable or memory by the processes. Can I do that from the signal handler itself.p  pHowever, in the case of threads using pthreads, I dont think it is doable.httpmaxim.int.rubookshelfPthreadsProgramhtmr40.html. As given in this article, they have mentioned that it is not asynchronous signal safe and have suggested to use sigwait for that. I am not why it is not asynchronous signal safe. I mean lets say, I handle a signal by a thread and is in the signal handler routing. I acquire a lock on the shared memory to update it. In the mean time another signal of the same type arrives and another thread responsible for handling it executes the signal handler again. Here the signal handler is same for the process but it is called multiple time. The second time around, it cannot see the lock and updatesoverrides the data. Is this the issue with multithreaded signal handlers using shared data.p  pI am a bit confused, in multi process systems, I have a copy of the signal handler for each process. But in multithreaded system, there is a single copy of the signal handler used by the multiple threads isnt it. So when multiple signals of the same type arrives and we have two threads that are responsible for handling it try to handle it, then both of them will try to execute the same piece of handler code How does it all fit inp

Negative 74354 pIve got an MVC3 project and one of the models is built as a separate class library project, for reuse in other applications.p  pIm using miniprofiler and would like to find a way to profile the database connections and queries that are made from this class library and return the results to the MVC3 applciation.p  pCurrently, in my MVC3 app, the existing models grab a connection using the following helper classp  precodepublic class SqlConnectionHelper      public static DbConnection GetConnection              var dbconn  new SqlConnectionConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[db].ToString         return new StackExchange.Profiling.Data.ProfiledDbConnectiondbconn, MiniProfiler.Current       codepre  pThe external model cant call this function though, because it knows nothing of the MVC3 application, or of miniprofiler.p  pOne way I thought of would be to have an codeIDbConnection Connectioncode field on the external model and then pass in a codeProfiledDbConnectioncode object to this field before I call any of the models methods. The model would then use whatevers in this field for database connections, and I should get some profiled results in the MVC3 frontend.p  pHowever, Im not sure if this would work, or whether its the best way of doing this. Is there a better way Im missingp

Negative 74354 pI am using MVC3 and have implemented IoC to provide servicemanager objects to controllers through constructor arguments.

Negative 74354 pI have a big SVG document a hrefhttpb2tf.commm.svg relnofollowherea, containing a map of all the quests in a certain online game.  Each quest node is inside a SVG codeltagtcode element, linking to a distinct named anchor in a big HTML document that loads in another tab, containing further details about that particular quest.  This works exactly as desired in desktop Safari, and Id expect it to work just as well in any browser that supports SVG at all since Im using only the most basic form of linking, but it fails badly on Mobile Safari iOS 6  which is my single most important browser target, considering that the game in question is for the iPad.  It only scrolls to the correct anchor on the initial load of the HTML page clicking a different quest in the SVG tab will cause a switch to the HTML tab, and the hash fragment ID in the address bar changes, but the page doesnt autoscroll.p  pThis appears to be a known limitation in Mobile Safari  hashonly changes in the URL apparently used to force a page reload, and that got overfixed such that nothing gets triggered at all now.  The fixes Ive found online all seem to be applicable only in cases where the URL change is being generated programatically, from within the same document, rather than static links from a different document.p  pFurther detailsp  ul liIve tried doing the named anchors in both the old codelta name...gtcode form, and the newer codelth1 id...gtcode form.  No difference.li liIve tried adding an codeonhashchangecode handler, to force the scrolling to take place, but the handler isnt being called at all verified by putting an alert in it.li liI could presumably fix the problem by having each quests details in a separate HTML file, but that would severely affect usability  with all the details in a single file, you can use your browsers Find feature to search through them all at once.

Negative 74354 pI am not sure if this is possible, so I am looking for suggestions. Here is the scenario. Use GAS Google Apps Script to fetch image files from slow source and uploadwritepost these files to somewhere else that is faster and more scaleable, like Google Developer Storage GDS. Then serve the files to my web site from GDS rather than the source.p  pI assume to use UrlFetchApp.fetchurl to get the image, and getContent to get the file, but I cant find how to sendpostwrite the file to a serverstoragep  pWhile looking through the docs, I noticed Cache Services. Maybe this is what I am looking for. But it appears to be for internal use, not to feed the cached data via a URL to a web site. I also noticed that the JDBC service allows you to write to a database, so I could store the image files in a database, but that seems overkill just to cache and reserve static images.p  pCheersp

Negative 74354 pI am working with a basic Bootstrap Carousel with three slides. Before I implemented the slider, I had one static image via css backgroundimage of its respective div. In my CSS, I was using backgroundsizecover, and really liked the way the image responded to different browser widths. Depending on the width of my image, I could get the important section of the image to always stay visibile and centered, while the extra width on either side was only visible on widescreen monitors as an added effect.p  pI want to retain that same image behavior now that Im using Bootstraps Carousel, but even if I assign dimensions to the slides viewport, I still cant get my background images to show up. I currently have it set up so each slide displays a separate css class, and each one has a different background image so it can scroll between three images.p  pIf this is not possible via backgroundimage, it there another way to manipulate image elements so their display behavior is the same as backgroundsizecoverp  pHeres my HTMLp  precode ltdiv idmyCarousel classcarousel slidegt   lt Carousel items gt   ltdiv classcarouselinnergt     ltdiv classactive item ad1gt       ltimg src STATICURL imgTestBannerAd.pnggt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classitem ad2gt       ltimg src STATICURL imgTestBannerAd2.pnggt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classitem ad3gt       ltimg src STATICURL imgTestBannerAd3.pnggt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt   lt Carousel nav gt   lta classcarouselcontrol left hrefmyCarousel dataslideprevgtamplsaquoltagt   lta classcarouselcontrol right hrefmyCarousel dataslidenextgtamprsaquoltagt ltdivgt codepre  pAnd my CSSp  precodemyCarousel      width 100  .carouselcontrol      margintop 20px  .carouselinner      width 100     height 400px  .ad1      background url..imgTestBannerAd.png norepeat center center fixed      webkitbackgroundsize cover     mozbackgroundsize cover     obackgroundsize cover     backgroundsize cover  .ad2      background url..imgTestBannerAd2.png norepeat center center fixed      webkitbackgroundsize cover     mozbackgroundsize cover     obackgroundsize cover     backgroundsize cover  .ad3      background url..imgTestBannerAd3.png norepeat center center fixed      webkitbackgroundsize cover     mozbackgroundsize cover     obackgroundsize cover     backgroundsize cover  codepre  pHopefully this isnt a stupid question and we can figure this outp

I would also like to make benchmark tests, like how many connected users or how fast the data will come.p  pI have googled and found that usually tickers are build in PHP as the server and the client has an ajax call for every 30 seconds which will return the new Data.

Negative 74354 pI have several tables in my application in which the data is retrieving and tables updated dynamically. I noticed on the device, when on screens which had more cells than the screen could fit, so required a scroll, it would lag while scrolling. p  pI started going through my code line by line to find the problem until I finally found itp  precodeCachedImages cache  [[CachedImages alloc] init]                     UIColor backgroundColour                     if[table getImage]  nil                                              backgroundColour  [[UIColor alloc] initWithPatternImage[cache getImageByPath[[table getImage] getName]]]                       cell.backgroundColor  [backgroundColour colorWithAlphaComponentfOpacity] codepre  pI have a table class which stores table info such as background image and datap  pIts this line in particularp  precodecell.backgroundColor  [backgroundColour colorWithAlphaComponentfOpacity] codepre  pif I comment out that one line, the table scrolls perfectly, but when I uncomment it, it causes the lag issue. So in order round this, I set up a instance variable which stored the background colour for the table and removed the cached images code from the delegate methods, so it is loaded before the table is, so it doesnt have to keep pulling it from cache everytime a cell needs redrawn.p  pThis has mostly fixed the issue, when I first access the screen and scroll down, it is a bit laggy, but after the initial scroll to the bottom, the performance is fine. Is there anyway to prevent this initial lag, I have moved all the heavy rendering out of the delegate methods, but this image code is still causing a slight lag the first time the user enters the screen.p  pAny ideas on how to prevent this The table is a custom table, and I is set up like thisp  precode  NSString CellIdentifier  CustomCellIdentifier                     CustomCell cell  CustomCell [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier]                     if cell  nil                                              NSArray nib  [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamedCustomCellView ownerself optionsnil]                         cell  [nib objectAtIndex0]                      codepre  pSo I am reusing the identifier.p  pAny suggestions would be much appreciatedp

Negative 74354 pIm implementing a web app that gives the user the ability to subscribe to a newsletter. Users only need to provide their email address, there is no signup page. To confirm the email address the system sends an email to the given address and asks the users to verify the email address by clicking a link. That links makes a GET requests to the servers and modifies a flag in the model that represents the users newsletter from confirmed  false to confirmed  true. The problem is that Im using a GET request that modifies the internal server state and this is bad. The thing is that all system that need email confirmation follow this pattern.p  pIs there a better way to do this Should I use Javascript to trigger an Ajax POST request when the users enters the confirmation page in his browserp  pSame applies for unsubscribes.p  pThanksp

The mobile view has 2 buttons which when clicked toggle the search form or main nav onoff.p  pHowever if I toggle off the search form and then resize my browser to desktop view the search form is still hidden in this viewp  pI have read about using classes such as visiblemobile etc but these seem to clash with the collapse plugin. I also realise I could probably write my own CSS hacks to fix this but thought Id ask if there was an easier solution.p  pBootstrap has events for show, shown, hide and hidden so I thought maybe I could write some custom JS which would show or hide these items in each particular device view. However I didnt know how to detect which device Im using at the time.p  pThoughtsp  pThanks in advancep

Do not expect this to be very heavy. p  p3 strongSmall operations on existing documentsstrong Increment an integer nested inside a document, or a check if value exists in an array nested inside a document, add a new entry to a list etc.p  pBased on your knowledge or experience, How would mongoDB perform given these tasksp  pThanks in advance.p  pI have been told that this question is vague, and I am not sure why. I am asking how well mongoDB is designed to handle these operations in general.p

Negative 74354 pId need to implement a custom project type that does not rely on a project file at all to persist its data, but, rather, is bound to a directory pretty much in the same way as the standard Website project works.p  pIve noticed that the Website project persists the path to the directory, as well as the website URL, in the .sln file. Is it possible for a custom project type to do the same, and, if so  howp  pNow, since there wont be a project file as such, it looks like I wont be able to use the standard approach to crafting project templates. Moreover, I am required to launch external code to generate the default project contents. I was thinking about implementing a custom wizard, but I am not at all sure if it is possible to craft a template that would just invoke a wizard to create the project and would not include any filebased contents p  pFinally, how do I provide an ability to open projects based on a directory and not a filep

Negative 74354 pIve been handed a project to complete and the clients have asked for a field from a customrecord attached to each customer to appear on their website. Were integrating with Netsuite on login, and saving their data in our database so we dont have to keep accessing Netsuite very slow.p  pOn login, we access Netsuite to do a SearchMultiSelectCustomField and find the customers company, and then do a CustomRecordSearchBasic and use their company ID to get a list of items they have access to.p  pWe loop over each of those items, and then loop over their custom fields. One of the fields has a typeId of 10, which means we do an ItemSearchBasic to get this items record and the items custom fields, saving the internalId of this item.p  pAt the end of this loop, we have an array of item IDs that a company is linked to. We also have the company ID custrecordnnitemcustomer and the Item ID custrecordnnitemcustomerlist.p  pI need to perform a get request on a custom record to check if that customer has been approved for that item.p  pThe customrecords ID is customrecordcustitem, and internal Id is 1.

Id like to be able to make a basic histogram showing the  of time spent in each diving bin, on average. It seems the best format for the data to be in for this purpose would be a table with two columns col1bin category e.g. avg50, and col2 numeric mean  time spent in that category. p  pYoull also notice that the data is broken up into different timing bins eventually Id like to be able to separate out the data by time of day, to see if, for example, the average diving depths shift between daynight, and so on. I figure that once I have this initial bit of code worked out, I can then do the same by timeofday by selecting, for example X0[whichHour.GMT.6]. Tips on this would also be very welcome.p  pThanksp
Negative 74354 pWe use IBM WCS v7 for one of our ecommerce based requirement, in which Apache solr is embeded for the search based implementation.p  pAs per a new requirement, there will be multiple language support for an website, ex France version of the site can have support for english, french etc. enFR, frFR etc. In order to configure solr with this interface, what should be the optimal indexing strategy using a single solr core p  pI got some ideas 1 using multiple fields in schema.xml for multiple languages, 2 using different solr cores for different languages.p  pBut these approaches dont seem to be the best one fitting to the current requirement, as there will be 18 language support for the ecommerce website. Using different fields for every language will be very complicated, and also using different solr code is not a good approach as we need to apply the configurational change in all the solr cores if ever it happens as per any requirement.p  pIs there any other approaches, or is there any way I can associate the localeId to the indexed data and process the search result with respect to the detected language p  pAny help on this topic will be highly appreciated.p  pThanks and Regards,p  pJitendriya Dashp

Perhaps sparks can only be created in an IO monadp  pIf this is the case, does anyone have an idea of how I could perform this tree product where each level is done in parallel without resulting in nested parallelism, which seems unnecessary for my task. In general, perhaps there is a better way to parallelize the tree product or make better use of Repa.p  pBonus points for explaining why the runtime increases as I increase the N parameter, even when no sparks are created.p  pstrongEDITstrong I changed the code example above to be a compiling example of my problem.

Why is that so The codeDerivedcode class can still access codebase.Valuecode, have logic for it, etc, and yet its value seems to be missing from the class. Is there a way to access it through reflection What is the reason that this value does not show up when reflecting through the codeDerivedcode type Note I realize I can reflect through codeBasecode and get the value, but I am asking why is that value not showing up when we reflect through codeDerivedcode even though its clearly there and can be manipulated.p  pstrongEDITstrong If instead both codeValuecode members were declared as fields instead of properties, the behavior is normal and reflection will get both of them.p
Negative 74354 pI am attempting to implement a proxy server and a proxy client in C separately yes. So in this scenario, we have a client, a proxy client, a proxy server and a server.p  pThe proxy client accepts a request for a specific host server and port number from a client and opens a single connection for that particular hostport pair with the proxy server. p  pThis connection is persistent. If any more requests come for the same hostport combination, it must be sent through the same connection. The requests are numbered with ids 0,1,... in each connection to distinguish one from the other.p  pFor every request not connection. there may be multiple requests per connection. received from the proxy client, the proxy server opens a connection for each request to the destination server. p  pHowever there needs to be a limit to the number of connections that can be opened to the destination server. I want to know how I can implement this limit. p  pSay I specify maximum number of connections that can be opened to h1 destination server to be 2. If a third connection comes in from the client proxy, what should the server proxy do p  ol lipShould I implement some kind of queue to store incoming requests, if there are already 2 open connections to the destination server pli lipIf yes, then should there be separate queues for separate hostport combinations And how would such a structure be implemented in Cpli ol  pIm feeling incredibly lost right now. Would really appreciate some guidance here.  P.S. Im coding in C using sockets.p

Negative 74354 hr  pI have this cakePHP app version 1.2 which started to behave oddly producing internal server errors when loading a certain page. p  pI then installed xDebug on my local Mamp environment and found out that the app runs into a loop when this page is accessed. Unfortunately I dont know how to interpret this, maybe you can help me out and point me into a direction before I start publishing code here.p  pMany thanksp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comT8OBY.png relnofollowpic infinite loopap  pEDIT  line 14 in the pic refers to the file mmenu.ctp which contains following requestp  precodemenus  thisgtrequestActionmenusreto codepre  pThe MenusController then contains following actionp  pclassp  precode MenusController extends AppController              var name  Menus             var helpers  arrayHtml, Form             function reto                 thisgtMenugtrecursive  2                 return thisgtMenugtfindall, arrayconditions gt arrayparentid gt 0, order gt Menu.order asc                   ...      codepre  pI hope that helps.p  pEDIT 2 Okey, I did more testing. In that page that is getting loaded, there are 3 requestActions The 1. one loads a Navigation from the database. The 2. and the 3. calls a GalleryController. At both times the same controller function but with different arguments.p  pNow when I either get rid of the 1. or the two gallery requests, the site loads without any problems. p  pMight it be, that requestAction uses up too much memory  But, why cakephp starts an infinite loop is still weird to me.p  pThe net tab of firebug did not reveal any usable info. It just stated the request to that particular site that I try to load.p  pEDIT 3p  pThanks for your reply Nunser  I did add the menu function in the appcontroler file within a beforeRender functionp  precodethisgtloadModelMenu              if issetthisgtviewVars[mainMenu]                             thisgtset                     mainMenu, thisgtMenugtfindall,                          arrayconditions gt arrayparentid gt 0, recursive gt 2, order gt Menu.order asc                                                             codepre  pI did not get rid of the recursive2 though, because i need joins from the menu table to a content table where additional infos are saved, like the url for example... the results array must look like thisp  precode[0] gt Array                      [Menu] gt Array                                      ...

Looked into a hrefhttpbook.cakephp.org1.3enTheManualCoreBehaviorsContainable.html relnofollowContainablea but with no luck.p  pAnyway, much more interesting is the 2. and the 3. requestAction to the GalleriesController Even if I have a very basic controller, only returning a string, when calling p  precodeecho thisgtrequestActiongalleriessidegal  ltphp     class GalleriesController extends AppController          var name  Galleries         var helpers  arrayHtml, Form          function sidegal          return testString                       gt codepre  pI get a loop. Any ideas on thisp  pEDIT 4 Soooo, after a hell of a lot of time I started up trying things with my GalleryModel, which looked like this firstp  precodevar hasMany  array         Gimage gt array             className gt Gimage,             foreignKey gt galleryid,             dependent gt true,             conditions gt ,             fields gt ,             order gt Gimage.order asc,             limit gt ,             offset gt ,             exclusive gt ,             finderQuery gt ,             counterQuery gt  ,             Child gt arrayclassName gt Gallery,             foreignKey gt parentid,             order gt Child.order asc             ,              codepre  pI spoted then, that the Child array causes problems. So I changed the word Child to Children it suddenly worked. The SOLUTION was the followingp  precodevar hasMany  array             Gimage gt array                 className gt Gimage,                 foreignKey gt galleryid,                 dependent gt true,                 conditions gt ,                 fields gt ,                 order gt Gimage.order asc,                 limit gt ,                 offset gt ,                 exclusive gt ,                 finderQuery gt ,                 counterQuery gt  ,                 Children gt arrayclassName gt Gallery,                 foreignKey gt parentid,                 order gt Children.order asc                 ,                  codepre  pI am happy that it works now. Thanks for your support Nunser, much appreaciated.p

The code of my custom adapter is the nextp  precodepublic class MarcaCursorAdapter extends SimpleCursorAdapter   private Context ctx  private Cursor cur  public MarcaCursorAdapterContext context, int layout, Cursor c,         String[] from, int[] to      supercontext, layout, c, from, to, 0     this.ctx  context     this.cur  c      TODO Autogenerated constructor stub   Override public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent      ifconvertView  null         convertView  View.inflatectx, R.layout.templatemarcas, null     View row  convertView      ImageView imgRk  ImageViewconvertView.findViewByIdR.id.tipoRanking     Dependiendo del ranking, cargaremos la imagen de mario o de wario     ifcur.getInt3  2  0         imgRk.setImageResourceR.drawable.btn1pressed     else         imgRk.setImageResourceR.drawable.btn1focus      return row   codepre  pAnd the content of templatemarcas.xml is the nextp  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidpaddingLeft10dp  androidbackground002EB8 androidpaddingTop20dp gt  ltTextView     androidididnomMarca     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue     androidlayoutalignParentToptrue     androidtextColorFFFFFF gt  ltTextView     androidididtextView69     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidlayoutalignBottomidnomMarca     androidlayouttoRightOfidnomMarca     androidtext es la numero      androidtextColorFFFFFF gt  ltTextView     androidididrankMarca     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidlayoutalignBottomidtextView69     androidlayouttoRightOfidtextView69     androidtextColorFFFFFF gt  ltImageView     androidididtipoRanking     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidlayoutalignParentRighttrue     androidlayoutalignTopidtextView69     androidlayoutmarginRight56dp gtltRelativeLayoutgt codepre  pSo, in order to use CursorLoader and ContentProvider, i converted my normal class that had a method to query the table to get a cursor of that table, i extended from ContentProvider and registered in the manifest file, the class is the nextp  precodepublic class MarcaDAO extends ContentProvider   private ConnHandler conn SQLiteDatabase dbObj  Override public int deleteUri uri, String selection, String[] selectionArgs       TODO Autogenerated method stub     return 0   Override public String getTypeUri uri       TODO Autogenerated method stub     return null   Override public Uri insertUri uri, ContentValues values       TODO Autogenerated method stub     return null   Override public boolean onCreate      conn  new ConnHandlergetContext     dbObj  conn.getDb     return true   Override public Cursor queryUri uri, String[] projection, String selection,         String[] selectionArgs, String sortOrder      Cursor cur  dbObj.queryMARCA, projection, null, null, null, null, null     return cur   Override public int updateUri uri, ContentValues values, String selection,         String[] selectionArgs       TODO Autogenerated method stub     return 0  codepre  pconn and dbObj objets are used to manage connection, those object works. And finally, i have the Activity which implements LoaderCallbacs with the overriden methods and initializing the CursorLoaderp  precodepublic class MarcaActivity extends Activity implements codepre  pLoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks p  precodeMarcaDAO dao MarcaCursorAdapter crsAdap  Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymarca      final ListView lstMarcas  ListViewfindViewByIdR.id.lstMarcas     Sacamos los datos de las marcas para mostrarlos en el listview     dao  new MarcaDAOthis     Cursor cur  dao.getList     getLoaderManager.initLoader0, null, this     crsAdap  new MarcaCursorAdapterthis, R.layout.templatemarcas, null ,              new String[]hipnombre, hipranking, new int[]R.id.nomMarca, R.id.rankMarca     lstMarcas.setAdaptercrsAdap   Override public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu       Inflate the menu this adds items to the action bar if it is present.     getMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.marca, menu     return true   Override public LoaderltCursorgt onCreateLoaderint arg0, Bundle arg1      return new CursorLoaderthis, Uri.parsecontentcom.example.crudapp.marcaData,             new String[]id, hipnombre, hipcodigo, hipranking, null, null, null   Override public void onLoadFinishedLoaderltCursorgt arg0, Cursor arg1      crsAdap.swapCursorarg1   Override public void onLoaderResetLoaderltCursorgt arg0      crsAdap.swapCursornull  codepre  pBut, when i run the application 4.2.2 i get a NullPointerException in the method getView of MarcaCursorAdapter in this linep  precodeifcur.getInt3  2  0 codepre  pBecause the cursor row values are null, and if i remove this code, the list loads the exact number of rows but with no values the textviews nomMarca and rankMarca are empty so i dont know what im doing wrong. Previously it worked without content provider and without cursorloader but i wanna develop good code so i changed my classes.p  pRegards.p  pUPDATE By the way, i forgot to say, if in the Activity instead using MarcaCursorAdapter i just use SimpleCursorAdapter losing the customization of my method getView the list loads without problems and showing the data, so i think that my problem is in the way that i coded my MarcaCursorAdapter class, but i dont know whats the mistake.p  pRegards again.p

Negative 74354 pPhones come with different camera apps from the manufacturer, and they all store the picturesvideos in their respective camera folder in codeDCIMcode. codeCameracode, codecameracode, code100ANDROcode, code100MEDIAcode, etc etc. The thing Im having problems with here, is to determine which exact folder name casesensitive the builtin camera app uses for its pictures and videos.p  pPlease correct me if Im wrong here, but some phones will have codeDCIMcode, others will have codeDcimcode or codedcimcode. Trying to match these names seems difficult, as matching is caseinsensitive due to the File System format of the SD Card, and Android Linux based is of course casesensitive, so any matching done will return true, but writingread will fail, because the actual folder name is wrong.p  pUsing codeDIRECTORYDCIMcode from the public class codeEnvironmentcode, will return the folder as DCIM in all cases in my scenarios, regardless if the actual name of the folder is DCIM, Dcim or dcim.p  pAny suggestions are welcome. There has to be a right way of doing this. Just matching with hardcoded strings is something I would like to avoid, but could be a lasthack option.  p

Negative 74354 pthe question refers to the sharded configuration of redis. I have implemented a small test application in Java which creates 100.000 user hashes over Jedis in the form of useruserID. Each hash has the elements name, phone, department, userID. I also created simple keyvalue pairs with the key phonephone number which contains the userID whose phone number is the ID and sets for each department with the userIDs who work for that particular department. The two latter types I use only for seaching. These structures and the search are similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17193176searchinginvaluesofaredisdbSearching in values of a redis dba.p  pIn short, the data structuresp  precodeuseruserIDgtname, department, phone, userID departmentdepartmentgt[userID1, userID2,....] phonephonegtuserID codepre  pUse cases for the searchp  ol liaccess to userhashes based on key i.e. userIDli lisearch for users with a phone numberli lisearch for all users of a departmentli ol  pEverything works all right in the strongsingle instancestrong and strongshardedstrong configuration but I would have the following questionsp  ul liIn the single instance configuration it is possible strongto look for phone number with a wide cardstrong e.g. with the strongKEYstrong method but this is not available in the sharded configuration.

Negative 74354 pMy objective is to use feedzirra, or a viable alternative, to access many varying RSS feeds and store them in ActiveRecords for later processing.  Obviously, these feeds will vary in composition.p  pJust running the sample feedzirra code, Ive found that its implementation of instance variables is sparse.  If the feed doesnt provide the information, the variable is left at nil.  This is okay, but as soon as I run a method like sanitize, I receive a NoMethod error on Nil.  p  pDoing some research, I see there is an instancevariables method that would allow me to grab active variables.  I could use that but it leaves the problem as to later downstream code that may be checking for instance variables that simply dont exist.p  pIm torn on how to handle the situation of sparse instance variables.  As I write my code, I need to be able to rely on the input so that I can run processes and methods without too much concern as to its reliability or existence.p  pAt this point, Ive simply set a rescue NoMethodError trap which is wholly insufficient.  I figure that I have to start with some of my own sanitize methods to ensure that the input is both safe and reliable.  But, when I get nil input, what do I do  I cannot leave it nil as later methods will fail.  I could inject some standard string such as   or unavailable, either of which could occur in the wild.  p  pThis is the first time that I have gathered input that Id considered wholly unsafe and unreliable.  I need recommendations on what I need to do to clean it up before I process it.p  pThanks... p

Negative 74354 pI have a div which has its CSS initially defined asp  precode.mydiv      position absolute     top 60px     left 60px     right 60px     bottom 60px     backgroundcolor cyan     overflow hidden  codepre  pThat is with equal distance from screen borders and I wanted to make it draggable via jQuery.

Which is not what I want it to be.p  pI know I could use codecalccode to solve it in a different way but I want to avoid it due to browser compatibility IE8.p  pI was wondering what Im doing wrongp

Negative 74354 pThis is a newbie R question. I am beginning to explore the use of R for website analytics. I have a set of page view events which have common properties along with an arbitrary set of properties that depend on the page. For instance, all events will have a codeuserIdcode, codecreatedAtcode, and codepageIdcode, but the codesignupcode page might have a special property codeorigincode whose value could be codeadwordscode or codeorganiccode, etc.p  pIn JSON, the data might look like thisp  precode[           userIdnull,       pageIdhome,       sessionIdabcd,       createdAt1381013741,       parameters,    ,           userId123,       pageIdsignup,       sessionIdabcd,       createdAt1381013787,       parameters          originadwords,          campaignId4            ] codepre  pI have been struggling to represent this data in R data structures effectively. strongIn particular I need to be able to subset the event list by conditions based on the arbitrary keyvalue pairs,strong for instance, select all events whose codepageIdsignupcode and codeoriginadwordscode.p  pThere is enough diversity in the keys used for the arbitrary parameters that it seems unreasonable to create sparselypopulated columns for every possible key.p  pWhat Im currently doing is preprocessing the data into two CSV files, codecoreproperties.csvcode and codeparameters.csvcode, in the formp  precode coreproperties.csv one record per pageview userId,pageId,sessionId,createdAt ,home,abcd 123,signup,abcd,1381013741 ...   parameters.csv one record per kv pair row,key,value    lt row here denotes the record index in coreproperties.csv 1,origin,adwords 1,campaignId,4 ... codepre  pI then coderead.tablecode each file into a data frame, and I am now attempting to store the kv pairs a list with nameskeys inside cells of the core events data frame. This has been a lot of awkward trial and error, and the best approach Ive found so far is the followingp  precodeevents lt read.csvcoreproperties.csv, headerTRUE parameters lt read.csvparameters.csv,    headerTRUE,colClassesccharacter,character,character paramLists lt sapply1nrowevents, functionx  list  applyparameters,1,functionx     paramLists [[ as.numericx[[row]] ]][[ x[[key]] ]] ltlt x[[value]]  eventsparameters lt paramLists  codepre  pI can now access the origin property of the first event by the syntax codeevents[1,][[parameters]][[1]][[origin]]code  note it requires for some reason an extra code[[1]]code subscript in there. Data frames do not seem to appreciate being given lists as individual values for cellsp  precodegt events[1,][[parameters]] lt list Error in [[lt.data.frametmp, parameters, value  list      replacement has 0 rows, data has 1 codepre  pIs there a best practice for handling this sort of data I have not found it discussed in the manuals and tutorials.p  pThank youp

Negative 74354 pI recently submitted my iOS app to Apple for review. It was written in C using Xamarin iOS, Monotouch and Monogame. I used the Xamarin IDE for development. A week later I get a rejection which specifies the reason being that the app crashes on iPad when the reviewer tries to access the InAppPurchase store, while on the iPhone 5s it doesnt crash, but indicates that it couldnt reach the Apple servers to retrieve the store items. Much of my store retrieving code is from Xamarins guide found a hrefhttpdocs.xamarin.comguidesiosapplicationfundamentalsinapppurchasingpart2storekitoverviewandretreivingproductinformation relnofollowherea. p  pThe problem is that I could not replicate those crashes. The store opens just fine with me and I tested it extensively. I tested on all simulators, and many real devices in debug amp release configurations iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 5s, iPad 3rd generation. I didnt test in adhoc mode since many of these devices were borrowed from my friends and I didnt want to sync in iTunes since that could wipe out device data. So am hoping release build and adhoc are equivalent in terms of finding the review teams bug. p  pAs for the crash logs given to me by Apple, they didnt help me since most lines dont get symbolicated properly in Xcode using the same archive that I submitted to Apple. There are a lot of lldbunnamedfunction lines in the log. All i was able to tell was that the crash occurred when trying to retrieve the store. Therefore am stuck and not  sure what to do next. Advice is appreciated.p  pBelow is the last portion of a long crash log.p  precodeIncident Identifier 24777CEA21FF434BA658BFB4BC89F7B2 CrashReporter Key   e981dd69858f1d35ba231cd2e288f3d33625919f Hardware Model      xxx Version             1 1 Code Type           ARM Native Parent Process      launchd [1] DateTime           20140109 133021.579 0800 OS Version          iOS 7.0.4 11B554a Report Version      104  Exception Type  EXCCRASH SIGABRT Exception Codes 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000 Triggered by Thread  0  Thread 0 name  Dispatch queue com.apple.mainthread Thread 0 Crashed 0   libsystemkernel.dylib          0x387e41fc pthreadkill  8 1   libsystempthread.dylib         0x3884ba4f pthreadkill  55 2   libsystemc.dylib               0x38795029 abort  73 3   MyGame                          0x00d8036d monohandlenativesigsegv miniexceptions.c2413 4   MyBeGame                        0x00d855b7 sigabrtsignalhandler miniposix.c206 5   libsystemplatform.dylib        0x38846721 sigtramp  41 6   libsystempthread.dylib         0x3884ba4f pthreadkill  55 7   libsystemc.dylib               0x38795029 abort  73 8   MyBeGame                        0x00e30744 monotouchunhandledexceptionhandler monotouchglue.m1436 9   MyBeGame                        0x00d8072d monoinvokeunhandledexceptionhook miniexceptions.c2749 10  MyBeGame                        0x00d8d7ab monothreadabortdummy mini.c2768 11  MyBeGame                        0x00d7ff35 monohandleexceptioninternal miniexceptions.c1710 12  MyBeGame                        0x00d7f6b7 monohandleexception miniexceptions.c2003 13  MyBeGame                        0x00d791b5 monoarmthrowexception exceptionsarm.c161 14  MyBeGame                        0x0023f7d4 lldbunnamedfunction12968MyBeGame  64 15  MyBeGame                        0x002da1d0 lldbunnamedfunction20307MyBeGame  92 16  MyBeGame                        0x00293960 lldbunnamedfunction17583MyBeGame  196 17  MyBeGame                        0x00212418 lldbunnamedfunction12101MyBeGame  168 18  MyBeGame                        0x0029205c lldbunnamedfunction17574MyBeGame  92 19  MyBeGame                        0x00295c58 lldbunnamedfunction17610MyBeGame  32 20  MyBeGame                        0x00083570 lldbunnamedfunction2892MyBeGame  860 21  MyBeGame                        0x000954f4 lldbunnamedfunction3194MyBeGame  1516 22  MyBeGame                        0x00093610 lldbunnamedfunction3176MyBeGame  40 23  MyBeGame                        0x0006246c MyBeGame.HintStoreController.HintStoreControlStateRetrievingltActivategtmF  624 24  MyBeGame                        0x0045d39c lldbunnamedfunction33945MyBeGame  48 25  MyBeGame                        0x0020c10c lldbunnamedfunction11957MyBeGame  196 26  MyBeGame                        0x00d8ce4f monojitruntimeinvoke mini.c6504 27  MyBeGame                        0x00dd482b monoruntimeinvoke object.c2827 28  MyBeGame                        0x00d5117b nativetomanagedtrampolineMonoTouchFoundationInternalNSNotificationHandlerPost registrar.m28 29  CoreFoundation                  0x2da4fe6f CFNOTIFICATIONCENTERISCALLINGOUTTOANOBSERVER  11 30  CoreFoundation                  0x2d9c3aad CFXNotificationPost  1717 31  Foundation                      0x2e3a9ec1 [NSNotificationCenter postNotificationNameobjectuserInfo]  69 codepre

Negative 74354 pCurrently developing an app for observing changes in a JCR Repository and replicate this changes to another repository. I cant rely on a cluster JCR cause the two repositories wont be on the same network, and the connection is not reliable, so my implementation takes care of the communication problem using a REST API between the two servers, and give some fault tolerance guarantees. The problem is I need to serialize nodes, preferably in a JSON format, and parse that JSON into a Node on the other side.p  pIve tried Apache Sling, using some internal classes it can serialize perfectly the node into a JSON format, but I cant seem to find a way to deserialize into a Node Object on the other side.

Negative 74354 pIm pretty new to android and am currently developing my third app, a button tapping game that involves a title activity, then a game activity. Before, When I wanted to rerun the game I would simply call onCreate from inside the game activity but Id much rather have it reset in a much smoother way, so I wrote a restart method to reset all the buttons back to their original state. The game runs fine when you run it from the title activity but when I try to restart the game, I find that some of my buttons are unresponsive when pressed. Ive tried many things but cant seem to find what the problem is I set the onClickListeners for all the buttonsthere are 15 in total in the onCreate then dont touch them again besides changing their color and giving them animations, but I just cant seem to find what the problem is. Could it be a memory issue they just seem to lag, like a have to hit them twice. I am also clearing the animations when the player looses the game.p  pI appreciate all the help you can provide.p

Negative 74354 pI am trying to have superfish render the menu so that each menu column has a set of css that will allow me to give each menu column different css attributes.

This creates an object using the template, which I then need to feed the live data into.p  pI want to use backbone marionette to update this object with the live data but Im unsure how it would be done.p  pCurrently, when I receive the correct type of iq to the pubsub node I am getting out the info I want, then calling a function updatewell which updates the object created by backbone from the original response.p  pIs backbone able to update this object from the pubsub event How would I call itp  pEdit below shows approximately what I do in the updatewell function. Can backbone marionette handle all of this Its not as simple as replace the template with new data, I need to hideshow information based on what is returned.p  pThe main issue I have using backbone marionette is that it constantly creates new objects. In the updatewell code you notice that I am defining divs with an ID that is unique, and updating based on that id which is returned in the IQ to the pubsub. This means the correct object is always updated, something I cant find to define in backbone marionette.p  pstrongIn essence, I need to tell marionette These are a new set of values, does a model with this value as its id exist if not, create it, if it does, update it with the other valuesstrongp  pPlease ask for more information.p  pMy code is below simplified as of 1st May 2014p  pBackbone Marionette codep  precodeInfoWell  Backbone.Model.extend  InfoWells  Backbone.Collection.extend     model  InfoWell   InfoWellView  Backbone.Marionette.ItemView.extend     template  templateinfowell,     tagName  div,     className  alert alertcustom,  initialize function       this.el.propid, this.model.getdatetime ,   InfoWellsView  Backbone.Marionette.CompositeView.extend     tagName  div,     id  infowelllist,     template  templateinfowells,     itemView  InfoWellView,    MainJs.addInitializerfunctionoptions      var aInfoWellsView  new InfoWellsView         collection  options.InfoWells          MainJs.InfoWellsContainer.showaInfoWellsView   var InfoWells  new InfoWells codepre  pResponse code to create wellp  precode    InfoWells.addnew InfoWell         id  datetime,         datetime  datetime,         title  title,         body  body,         comments  comments      codepre  pPubsub codep  precodepubsubHandlerInfo  functioniq      var date  iq.finddatetime.get     ...

I create a variable called update which gets its value from looking at the collection emInfoWellsem and getting the ID with value emdatetimeem, which from above you can see is the unique ID value I assigned every model.p  pI then check if this update value actually exists, and if it does I call the emstrongsetstrongem command, which tells it to send these new values into the model for the attributes mentioned. Note that I left out emidem as I will never update that for a model.p  pThen, as Dmytro mentioned, I added the render to the ItemView when a model changes.p  precode    modelEvents          change render      codepre  pThe next step for me, to replicate my update well, is use emstrongchangeATTRIBUTE  functionstrongem.p  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 74354 pI am updating a set of functions that previously only accepted codedata.framecode objects to work with codedata.tablecode arguments.p  pI decided to implement the function using Rs method dispatch so that the old code using codedata.framecodes will still work with the updated functions. In one of my functions, I take in a codedata.framecode as input, modify it, and then return the modified codedata.framecode. I created a codedata.tablecode implementation as well. For examplep  precode The functions foo lt functiond    UseMethodfoo   foo.data.frame lt functiond    ltDo Somethinggt   returnd   foo.data.table lt functiond    ltDo Somethinggt   returnd  codepre  pI know that codedata.tablecode works by making changes without copying, and I implemented codefoo.data.tablecode while keeping that in mind. However, I return the codedata.tablecode object at the end of the function because I want my old scripts to work with the new codedata.tablecode objects. Will this make a copy of the codedata.tablecode How can I check According to the documentation, one has to be very explicit to create a copy of a codedata.tablecode, but I am not sure in this case.p  pThe reason I want to return something when I do not have to with codedata.tablescodep  pMy old scripts look like thisp  precodesomeData lt read.table... ... someData lt foosomeData codepre  pI want the scripts to be able to run with codedata.tablecodes by just changing the data ingest lines. In other words, I want the script to work by just changing codesomeData lt read.table...code to codesomeData lt fread...code.p

Negative 74354 pThere has been a large number of parallel RNG questions here, but I couldnt find one which addresses my variant.p  pIm writing a function that given a seed fills a long array with random numbers based on that seed. I currently do that serially, but I find that the RNG is taking a significant amount of the running time of my program. I therefore want to speed up my function by using multiple threads. But I want this to be transparent to the user. That is, given a seed, one should get the same random number sequence out independent of the number of threads the function uses internally.p  pMy current idea for doing this is to divide the array into chunks independently of the number of threads, and generate a new RNG for every chunk, for example by seeding each RNG with the seedchunkid. The chunks could then be processed independently, and it would not matter which thread processes which chunk. But I am worried that this might reduce the quality of the RNG. Is this a safe way of doing this for a highquality RNG like mersenne twisterp  pTo illustrate, here is some pseudocode for the processp  precodefunction randomarray, seed, blocksize100000   for each block of size blocksize in array     rng[block]  createrngseedi   parallel for each block in array     for each sample in block       array[sample]  callrngrng[block] codepre  pThis should produce the same values for each seed,blocksize combination. But is this the best way of doing thisp

Cordova has   not yet been fully integrated with this new Storage Access Framework.   Because of this, the getPicture method will not correctly return   pictures when the user selects from the Recent, Drive, Images,   or External Storage folders when the destinationType is FILEURI.   However, the user will be able to correctly select any pictures if   they go through the Gallery app first. Potential workarounds for   this issue are documented on this StackOverflow question.

Negative 74354 pThis question came up while I was reading the answers to  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq140055081436796So why is i  i  1 welldefined in C11ap  pI gather that the subtle explanation is that 1 the expression codeicode returns an lvalue but codecode takes prvalues as operands, so a conversion from lvalue to prvalue must be performed this involves obtaining the current value of that lvalue rather than one more than the old value of codeicode and must therefore be sequenced emafterem the side effect from the increment i.e., updating codeicode 2 the LHS of the assignment is also an lvalue, so its value evaluation does not involve fetching the current value of codeicode while this value computation is unsequenced w.r.t. the value computation of the RHS, this poses no problem 3 the value computation of the assignment itself involves updating codeicode again, but is sequenced after the value computation of its RHS, and hence after the prvious update to codeicode no problem.p  pFine, so there is no UB there. Now my question is what if one changed the assigment operator from codecode to codecode or a similar operator.p  blockquote   pDoes the evaluation of the expression codei  i  1code lead to undefined behaviorp blockquote  pAs I see it, the standard seems to contradict itself here. Since the LHS of codecode is still an lvalue and its RHS still a prvalue, the same reasoning as above applies as far as 1 and 2 are concerned there is no undefined behavior in the evalutation of the operands on codecode. As for 3, the operation of the compound assignment codecode more precisely the side effect of that operation its value computation, if needed, is in any case sequenced after its side effect now must embothem fetch the current value of codeicode, emand thenem obviously sequenced after it, even if the standard does not say so explicitly, or otherwise the evaluation of such operators would emalwaysem invoke undefined behavior add the RHS and store the result back into codeicode. Both these operations would have given undefined behavior if they were unsequenced w.r.t. the side effect of the codecode, but as argued above the side effect of the codecode is sequenced before the value computation of codecode giving the RHS of the codecode operator, which value computation is sequenced before the operation of that compound assignment, that is not the case.p  pBut on the other hand the standard also says that codeE  Fcode is equivalent to codeE  E  Fcode, except that the lvalue E is evaluated only once. Now in our example the value computation of codeicode which is what codeEcode is here emas lvalueem does not involve anything that needs to be sequenced w.r.t. other actions, so doing it once or twice makes no difference our expression should be strictly equivalent to codeE  E  Fcode. But heres the problem it is pretty obvious that evaluating codei  i  i  1code would give undefined behaviour What gives Or is this a defect of the standardp  pstrongAdded.strong I have slightly modified my discussion above, to do more justice to the proper distinction between side effects and value computations, and using evaluation as does the standard of an expression to encompass both. I think my main interrogation is not just about whether behavior is defined or not in this example, but how one must read the standard in order to decide this. Notably, should one take the equivalence of codeE op Fcode to codeE  E op Fcode as the ultimate authority for the semantics of the compound assignment operation in which case the example clearly has UB, or merely as an indication of what mathematical operation is involved in determining the value to be assigned namely the one identified by codeopcode, with the lvaluetorvalue converted LHS of the compound assignment operator as left operand and its RHS as right operand. The latter option makes it much harder to argue for UB in this example, as I have tried to explain. I admit that it is tempting to make the equivalence authoritative so that compound assignments become a kind of secondclass primitives, whose meaning is given by rewriting in term of firstclass primitives thus the language definition would be simplified, but there are rather strong arguments against thisp  ul lipThe equivalence is not absolute, because of the codeEcode is evaluated only once exception. Note that this exception is essential to avoid making any use where the evaluation of codeEcode involves a side effect undefined behavior, for instance in the fairly common codea[i]  bcode usage. If fact I think no absolutely equivalent rewriting to eliminate compound assignments is possible using a fictive codecode operator to designate unsequenced evaluations, one might try to define codeE op Fcode with codeintcode operands for simplicity as equivalent to code intamp LE  int RF L  L  R code, but then the example no longer has UB. In any case the standard gives us no rewriitng recipe.pli lipThe standard does not treat compound assignments as secondclass primitives for which no separate definition of semantics is necessary. For instance in 5.17 emphasis minep  blockquote   pThe assignment operator  and the compound assignment operators all group righttoleft. [...] strongIn all casesstrong, the assignment is sequenced after the value   computation of the right and left operands, and before the value computation of the assignment expression. With respect to an indeterminatelysequenced function call, strongthe operation of a compound assignment is a single evaluationstrong.p blockquoteli liIf the intention were to let compound assignments be mere shorthands for simple assignments, there would be no reason to include them explicitly in this description. The final phrase even directly contradicts what would be the case if the equivalence was taken to be authoritative.li ul  pIf one admits that compound assignments have a semantics of their own, then the point arises that their evaluation involves apart from the mathematical operation more than  just a side effect the assignment and a value evaluation sequenced after the assignment, but also an unnamed operation of fetching the previous value of the LHS. This would normally be dealt with under the heading of lvaluetorvalue conversion, but doing so here is hard to justify, since there is no operator present that takes the LHS emas an rvalueem operand though there is one in the expanded equivalent form. It is precisely this unnamed operation whose potential unsequenced relation with the side effect of codecode would cause UB, but this unsequenced relation is nowhere explicitly stated in the standard, because the unnamed operation is not. It is hard to justify UB using an operation whose very existence is only implicit in the standard.p

Negative 74354 pI am looking to use vba to select and highlight a certain range based on a certain start and end period inputted into another column.p  pI would like to enter a start time into Column A row 20 and finish time in the same column row 22. From this I would like it to highlight a range between these times starting in column B across to Y. Therefore this highlights the time period down the column B and all its relevant readings across to Y.p  pThe input data in column A is the following 24Jun10 040000                                          and 24Jun10 050000 and so basically using these as a link to change the range.p  pThis will be used as a template and so the input cells will always be changing.p  pIs this possible to achievep  pThanks.p
Negative 74354 psince Im not that good in SQL I decided to make my first time posting here, because I stuck with creating a query for a few days and couldnt figure out how to make it properly.

Negative 74354 pI have two dictonaries A and B and both have the same keys a, b and value. All 3 values of behind those keys are numpy arrays of the same size, but the size may differ between A and B. If found this link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15677693mergedictionariesandaddvaluesherea but it is only for onedimensional keys One can see a combination a0,b0 as coordinates in cartesian space and value0 as their value. And i have two datasets A and B. As an examplep  precodeA  a numpy.array[1, 1, 9, 9],      b numpy.array[0, 1, 0, 1],      value numpy.array[1, 2, 3, 4] B   a numpy.array[1, 1, 7, 7],      b numpy.array[0, 1, 0, 1],      value numpy.array[101, 102, 1003, 1004] codepre  pI need to sum the values of those dictionarys, if both keys are the same, otherwise i want to append the keys and the values. In the example Both dictionaries share the key combination a1 and b0, as well as a1 and b1. Their values are added up 1101102 and 2102104. The key combination a9, b0 and a9, b1 are only in dictionary A The key combination a7, b0 and a7, b1 are only in dictionary B So I want this resultp  precodeC  a numpy.array[1, 1, 9, 9, 7, 7],      b numpy.array[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],      value numpy.array[102, 104, 3, 4, 1003, 1004 ] codepre  pI came up with a solution, which takes dictionary A and modifies it by adding or appending something from dictionary B. Therefore it first generates onedimensional hash keys of those twodimensional key combinations in A and one for those in B. Then uses numpy.intersect to find the common keys in both dictionaries and adds the values of B to the values of A at that indices. Afterwards i take the invert of the intersection and append both the uncommon keys and the value to dictionary A.p  precodedef exampleA, B      generate hash keys 32 bit shift because values in a and b are larger than in example     hashA  maplambda a, b inta ltlt 32  intb, A[a], A[b]     hashB  maplambda a, b inta ltlt 32  intb, B[a], B[b]       intersection is now 1dimensional and easy     intersect  numpy.intersect1dhashA, hashB       common keys     A[value][numpy.in1dhashA, intersect]  B[value][numpy.in1dhashB, intersect]       keys only in B and not in A     onlyinB  numpy.in1dhashB, intersect, invertTrue     if anyonlyinB         A[a]  numpy.appendA[a], B[a][onlyinB]         A[value]  numpy.appendA[value], B[value][onlyinB]         A[b]  numpy.appendA[b], B[b][onlyinB]      return A codepre  pBut my solution seems too slow to be useful and I cannot think of a quicker way of getting there. The numpy.arrays used have millions of entries, and this is done for several combinations of dictionaries. speed is an issue. Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 74354 pIm struggling to find the best approach to running multiple OS commands in parallel and being able to capture the output from them. The OS command is a semilong running proprietary utility written in C. running on solarislinux hosts and using python 2.4 From a high level, this script will pull jobs from a job queue, instantiate a class for each job, wherein the class then spawns the OS utility with provided arguments.

Negative 74354 pIm trying to implement a simple listout functionality from a table of placesspots of a city.p  pTo do this, I created a Place class and returned a codemysqlfetchassoccode array from a get function. This code is in a PHP file called placeops.php, containing only OO logic.p  pNow moving to another file called displayplaces.php, I call the same get function here to get the codemysqlfetchassoccode array into another variable.

If I use codecurrentcode to get a specific columnattribute value, it says current expects array, string passed error. By NOT using codecurrentcode, I can only access the first element, as expected.

Negative 74354 pMy official question will be Is there a clean way to use data types to encode and compress data rather than using messy bit masking. The hopes would be to save space in the case of compressing, and I would like to use native data types, structures, and arrays in order to improve readability over bit masking. I am proficient in bit masking from my assembly background but I am learning C and OOP. We can store so much information in a 32 bit register by using individual bits and I feel that I am trying to get back to that low level environment while having the readability of C code. p  pI am attempting to save some space because I am working with huge resource requirements. I am still learning more about how c treats the codeboolcode data type. I realize that memory is stored in byte chunks and not individual bits. I believe that a codeboolcode usually uses one byte and is masked somehow. In my head I could use 8 codeboolcode values in one byte.p  pIf I malloc in C an array of 2 codeboolcode elements. Does it allocate two bytes or just one p  pExample We will use DNA as an example since it can be encoded into two bit to represent A,C,G and T. If I make a struct with an array of two codeboolcode called DNABase, then I make an array of 20 of those.p  precodestruct DNABase  bool Bit1  bool Bit2  DNABase DNASequence[7]  false cout ltlt sizeofDNABaseltltsizeofDNASequenceltltendl Yields a 2 and a 14.  I would like this to say 1 and 2. codepre  pIn my example I would also show the case where the DNA sequence can be 20 bases long which would require 40 bits to encode. GATTACA could only take up a maximum of 2 bytes I suppose an alternative question would have been How to make C do the bit masking for me in a more readable way or should I just make my own data type and classes and implement the bit masking using classes and operator overloading. p

Negative 74354 pI want to draw a rectangle on a canvas around the mouse cursor that smoothly follows the cursor. Unfortunately, the mousemoved event doesnt fire quickly enough, and the drawing constantly trails behind it. So Im assuming I need to predict where the mouse is, and draw the rectangle at that point. Im trying to write a simple library to abstract that away, but its not tracking as closely as Id like for fast movements in fact, fast movements are jittery. For slow movements, it tracks fairly well, and better than the simple solution of using the raw mouse coordinates.p  pThe basic idea is that mousemove updates a couple of external variables with the current position of the mouse. A requestAnimationFrame loop the Watcher function tracks these variables and their previous values over time to calculate the speed the mouse is moving at in the x axis. When the PredictX function is called, it returns the current x position, plus the last change in x multiplied by the speed. A different reqeustAnimationFrame loop moves the rectangle based on the predicted x value. p  precodevar MouseLerp  function       var MOUSELERP       var currentx  0     var lastx  0     var dX  0     var lasttime  0     var xspeed  0      var FPS  60      function Watchertime          var dT  time  lasttime         if dT gt 1000  FPS              dX  lastx  currentx             lastx  currentx             xspeed  dX  dT              lasttime  time                   requestAnimationFrameWatcher           MOUSELERP.PredictX  function           return Math.floordX  xspeed  currentx           MOUSELERP.Test  function           var targetelement  .container         targetelement.appendltcanvas width500 height500 idbasecanvasgtltcanvasgt         var basectx  document.getElementByIdbasecanvas.getContext2d          var offset  targetelement.offset         var offsetx  offset.left         var offsety  offset.top          var WIDTH  window.width         var HEIGHT  window.height          var FPS  60          var t1  0          function updateRecttime               var dT  time  t1             if dT gt 1000  FPS                  basectx.clearRect0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT                 basectx.beginPath                 basectx.strokeStyle  FF0000                 basectx.lineWidth  2                  basectx.rectMOUSELERP.PredictX, 100, 100, 100                 basectx.stroke                 t1  time                          requestAnimationFrameupdateRect                  updateRect          targetelement.mousemovefunction event              currentx  event.pageX  offsetx                   requestAnimationFrameWatcher          MOUSELERP.Test     return MOUSELERP  codepre  pWhat am I doing wrongp  pHeres a jsfiddle of the above a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netp8Lr224p relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netp8Lr224pap  pThanksp

Negative 74354 pI am trying to do a PCA on a matrix in matplotlib but keep encountering LinAlgError SVD did not converge. Ive checked my data for bad values.

Negative 74354 pComing from a C background where I learned to restrict the use of exceptions to exceptional circumstances, I was very surprised about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq5981572932052Pythons cheap exceptionsa. In fact, some language features like iteration seem to be build on exceptions being thrown. This makes sense when considering that the python interpreter has to guarantee its own integrity and thus does several checks anyway.p  pDoes it make sense to expect cheap exceptions to be normal in interpreted languagesp  pstrongEditstrong p  pTo make clear that this question doesnt address primarily performance, I should add that I try to expand my programming skills by learning new languages. Id probably never use exceptions in nonexceptional circumstances in C or Pascal, but in python I obviously should and this is maybe not the only language. And because it makes a structural difference for my code if I use or not use exceptions, a simple guidelinerule of thumb would help to get started in a new language..p

Negative 74354 pIm dealing with a C system that offers a hook of this formp  precodeint EXTENSIONFUNCTIONNATIVEVALUE args[] codepre  pIts possible to register an EXTENSIONFUNCTION and the number of arguments it takes.p  pMy idea was that Id make a class codeExtensioncode to wrap up an extension.  It would be able to be constructed from a stdfunction emor any Callable, ideally, but lets just say it contains a stdfunction for nowem.  And the extension takes Value parameters, which wrap up NATIVEVALUE embut are largerem.  Id automatically take care of the parameter count with codesizeof...Tscode, for instance.  It might look like thisp  precodeExtensionltlibInteger, libStringgt foo      []libInteger i, libString s gt int          stdcout ltlt i         stdcout ltlt s         return 0      codepre  pProblem is that in order for the C library to register and call it, it wants that arraybased interface.  p  pI set out to try and get the compiler to write a little shim, but I dont see a way to do it.  I can have a variadic codeoperatorcode on Extension, and do a runtime loop over the NATIVEVALUE to get an array of Value[].  But what do I do with that  I cant call the stdfunction with it.p  pSo it seems I need to make an EXTENSIONFUNCTION instance which calls my stdfunction, as a member of each Extension instance.p  pBut basically I find myself up against a wall where I have a variadic templated class for the extension... and then a sort of cant get there from here in terms of taking this codeNATIVEVALUE args[]code and being able to call the stdfunction with them.  If stdfunction would be willing to be invoked with a stdarray of arguments, that would solve it, but of course that isnt how it works.p  pIs it possible to build a shim of this type  The ugly thing I can do is just proxy to another array, likep  precodeExtensionlt2gt foo      []libValue args[] gt int          libInteger i args[0]         libString s args[1]         stdcout ltlt i         stdcout ltlt s         return 0      codepre  pBut thats not as ergonomic.  It seems impossible, without knowing the calling convention and doing some kind of inline assembly stuff to process the parameters and CALL the function emand even that would work for functions only, not Callables in generalem.  But people here have proven the impossible possible before, usually by way of emthats not what you want, what you actually want is...emp  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong I just found this, which seems promising...Im still trying to digest its relevancep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7858817unpackingatupletocallamatchingfunctionpointerquotunpackingquot a tuple to call a matching function pointerap  pem Note There are a few crosscutting issues in what I aim to do.

Negative 74354 pI have a few ideas regarding this one, but would like to gather some intel before implementing a solution.p  pI have an app where new records need to be manually assessed by customer service agents. Lets assume that I get 100 new customer queries and I have 10 Customer Agents that need to answer these queries. What is the best way to implement this queuing processor Points to notep  ol liOnly one agent can work on a request at any given timeli liIf another agent is already working on a record, another agent should not be able to access it.li liThe system needs to be smart in the sense that it should be able to handle when multiple agents try to access the same record at the same time I know the odds of users trying to access the same record at exactly the same time might be slim but I still need to accommodate for thisli ol  pSome of he solutions Ive thought ofp  ol liLocking a database record if an agent opens it Does this solve 3 aboveli liAssigning records randomly to only one agent at a timeli ol  pDoes anybody have an idea of what the best solution might be Is there a gem that I can use for this sort of thingp  pThanks.p

Negative 74354 pI have acceleration x,y,z and roll, pitch, heading data from a 3axis IMU. I want to compensate the acceleration data based on the angles r,p,h measured by the gyro. For example, when the IMU is flat and stationary zaxis up, the accelerations read [ax,ay,az][0,0,1]. When the IMU is flat and stationary xaxis up, the accelerations read [ax,ay,az][1,0,0]. And finally when the IMU is flat and stationary yaxis up, the accelerations read [ax,ay,az][0,1,0].p  pSince data was collected with the IMU strongnotstrong being perfectly flat and level, I need to remove gcomponents from my acceleration data.p  pBelow is my first pass at removing the gcomponents.

Shouldnt it allocate the required memory with reserve For example for 4m records it allocates with reserve 38.9Mb and then after the inserts an additional 256.5Mb.p  pProblem B The insert process is rather slow. I checked the load factor, and it never increases more than 0.5. Are there any suggestions for anything else to check I use MyRecords.insert for insertion.p  pProblem C After i complete my calculations i call MyRecords.clear . Instead of deleting the contents instantly it starts removing record by record approx 3Mbsecond. If i dont call clear i get the same behavior. Is this normal I checked all previous stackoverflow questions and the only suggestion i found was that it might be related to debugging. I used the O3 option but it didnt change anything.p  pI am using the MinGW64 compiler 4.9.1 version.p  pThank you all for reading this and for your suggestions.p  pstrongEDIT After Comments and Solutions proposedstrongp  pIt seems that there is no way to release or preallocate the memory of the STL for unorderedmaps when using other than standard types for the the key and the data contained. The Reserve method, reserves memory only for the hashes. Using a vectorlt with indexes computed from the key of the values worked very well. Just preallocate the vector, then using myvector.at  value, set the values. The default destructor releases the vector almost instantly with 4m values takes 23secs rather than 5minutes with the unorderedmap. Memory usage with the vector is less since no key is stored Random access to the vector seems a little slower though, havent profiled the code yet.p  pThank you all again for the help.p

Negative 74354 plong time lurker first time poster here. My question is about Navigation Controllers in Xcode 6.1.1. p  pBasically Ive created a feed app that grabs posts from my Wordpress Site and shows them in a table list. When an item from the list is selected, a web view shows the url from the selected item. I want to manage moving between these two views table and webview with a navigation controller, so I embedded one into the table list view on my storyboard establishing the table view as the Root. When I run the app, I get a blank screen with an empty navigation bar at the top of the screen nav controller is set to initial view. I expect to see the list view inside the controller but I get nada. In the past Ive been able to do this without writing any code and its worked no problem.p  pNot sure why this is happening, but Im sure its something really simple that Im overlooking. Any help would be awesome. Thanks for looking.p

Negative 74354 pAs recommended by Heroku, I switched one of our Rails 3.2 Ruby 2.0.0 apps from Unicorn to Puma. Almost immediately we started seeing many 30 second timeouts H12 errors on at least 5 of our requests. Something we never had when running on Unicorn. p  pHeres our setupp  precodeworkers IntegerENV[WEBCONCURRENCY]  2 threadscount  IntegerENV[MAXTHREADS]  5 threads threadscount, threadscount  preloadapp  rackup      DefaultRackup port        ENV[PORT]  3443 environment ENV[RACKENV]      development  onworkerboot do    Valid on Rails up to 4.1 the initializer method of setting pool size   ActiveSupport.onloadactiverecord do     config  ActiveRecordBase.configurations[Rails.env]  Rails.application.config.databaseconfiguration[Rails.env]     config[pool]  ENV[DBPOOL]  ENV[MAXTHREADS]  5     ActiveRecordBase.establishconnectionconfig   end end codepre  pSince our app is likely not thread safe, weve set codeMAXTHREADScode to code1code and scaled the processes by setting codeWEBCONCURRENCYcode to values ranging from code4code to code8code. We generally run a number of 2x dynos, but we also tried 1x dynos. No matter how we up or downscale these, the H12s keep coming. Memory usage stays within the normal bounds. Additionally, since were running just 1 thread per processes, we have set the codeDBPOOLcode to code1code. We have also configured RackTimeout to timeout at 28 seconds.p  pIm stuck trying to find what is causing this. Does anyone have an idea of what might be going wrong or how to most easily find what is causing thisp  pThanks p  pP.S. The main reason why we want to move away from Unicorn, is because we tend to have a number of occasional slow clients that block a whole array of request transactions. Puma presumably does not suffer from this, so we would really like to get that going. p

Negative 74354 pI apologize if the title is a bit confusing, let me explain.  Part of my work is processing  tagging large datasets from an ERP system and make it more meaningful for reporting purposes.  I use 2010 access databases to manipulate and tag data to regularly create static datasets user can point excel pivot tables to, this allows them to create reports for their clients.p  pWe have had many issues of users using the default excel connection which is a [Share Deny Write] OLEDB connection.  This locks the source .accdb, preventing us from dropping an updated source.accdb file if any one of the dozens of users has their excel report open after refreshing their file.p  pTo get around this, I found creating a shadow .accdb which simply contains linked tables or queries that query the source.accdb, these connections do not lock the source.accdb allowing us to overwrite the file with updated data as we please.p  pSome users still seek out the source.accdb and link directly to it, so we are trying to password protect them to prevent this.  I have no issues creating a select from the shadow.accdb to query the source.accdb using the proper password.  The problem arises when I try to link to any of the queries in the shadow.accdb from excel, I am thrown an invalid password error.p  pThe issue seems to be the excel oledb or odbc connection is not being passed the password from the SQL query inside the shadow.accdbp  pYes, I understand this is a backasswards way of setting up data sources, but there are to many users to police the connections, I have no option of changing the programs we use, and there is no way from the database end to kill an excel connection to an access db, and so this is what I have to work with.p  pWhile I doubt anyone has specific experience with this setup, any ideas would be great.  An example of the connections from shadow.accdb to source.accdb is belowp  precodeSELECT  FROM table IN  [MS AccessPWDpasswordDATABASECdirectorySource.accdb] codepre

Negative 74354 pI am a beginner Python user and I am having troubles understanding some things. I want to convert 2 whole columns lat, long in a .csv file from degrees minutes seconds dms to decimal degrees dd ie. 465701N  to 46.950278. Im probably doing this the long way around, but I dont know any better. So far I have renamed the headings in my .csv to be readable in ArcGIS. Then I used Excel to replace the , , and N with spaces and then put them in a new .csv file with their respective ID number Accnum...wanted to use Python, but couldnt figure it out for the life of me. Then I replaced the spaces with commas to be able to convert each section coordinate. I also made a def to convert dms to dd, dm to dd and d to dd...did this because some of my coordinates are only degrees and some are only degrees minutes.

Negative 74354 pI have a specific set of requirements for parsing command line options.

I just happen to be working with 4bit colors.p  pExample of a valid input seriesp  precodez 1 r 5 g 2 b 12 z 4 colorffe zone3 color8,8,4 codepre  pThe z or zone is the separator that starts a new option group.

I expect to handle parsing that myself.p  pExample of eminvalidem inputp  precodezone1 r 12 g 15 z 3 r 8 g 6 b 10 b 18 codepre  pThis demonstrates exactly why I cant just work with an array of options. My program needs to be able to identify and alert that in between codezone1code and the next zone, it did not find a b, emandem that between codez 3code and the end of the parameters, it found two b. Using the arrays provided by codegetOptionValuescode, I would only see that there are two each of rgb, and assume there was no problem, because they arent tied to a parent or group of any sort.p  pI need to know if Commons CLI can handle repeating emgroupsem of options, or if I need to switch to another parser, or if Im better off writing my own parser for the admittedly small variety of options.p

Negative 74354 pI am trying to move the info of data flows to a DB. The data flows are something like thisp  pEApp1 sends data to IApp1. IApp1 then sends this data to IApp3. IApp3 then sends this data to IApp5. EApp2 sends data to IApp2. IApp2 then sends this data to IApp3. IApp3 then sends this data to IApp5. EApp3 sends data to IApp2. IApp2 then sends this data to IApp4. IApp4 then sends this data to IApp5. IApp5 then sends this data to IApp6. EApp4 sends data to IApp3. IApp3 then sends this data to IApp5. IApp5 then sends this data to IApp6. EApp5 sends data to IApp2. IApp2 then sends this data to IApp4. IApp4 then sends this data to IApp5.p  pI am thinking of having a property named OF of the sends data relationship that will contain names of the data that is being sent so I can trace the flow of a particular application. Something on the lines of the below diagram. Is it possible to query the OF values, like show all relations whose OF value contains EApp4 onlyp  pThis is the first time I am trying Graph DB and I am thinking of using it as the relationships are complex. I am not looking for high performance here. Is there some other approach I should follow to be able to achieve the result of tracing the flow of a particular applicationp  pLink to the diagrama hrefhttps27.postimg.org5qieemks3GraphDataModeling.jpg relnofollowhttps27.postimg.org5qieemks3GraphDataModeling.jpgap

Negative 74354 pIve got a weird issue here. Ill start by explaining my programp  pI have a C application. The main goal of the program is to get information about a book based on its ISBN. The ISBN is passed to the program via a TCPIP scanner on an Android device. The ISBN is then put into a valid URL which is used to grab the XML data from ISBNDB.com.p  pThe issue that I am having is this H2When I query an ISBN typed into a TextBox, the program works fine. When I query an ISBN scanned from the reader, it returns No Resultsh2p  pI have implemented various ways to try and get to the bottom of this case.

Negative 74354 pMy web server is based on Delphi  DataSnap.

It is a DataSnap based application that works as Web Api server. A codeTDSServerClasscode components instances my codeTServerMethodscode class. Then, when a web connection arrives, DataSnap creates a new thread and call to my codeTServerMethodscode methods. If within the method, a exception is raised, then it is lost because each thread has its stack. With codeApplication.OnExceptioncode, I only can catch unhandheld exceptions from the IDE thread. What I want to do is to log any handheld exception in a log file.p

Negative 74354 pI am building a an application around spring MVC that incorporates springbatch, that dynamically manages the batch processes in a manner similar to what springbatchadmin does.

Negative 74354 pAn a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comrurulibrarywindowsdesktophh80269028vvs.8529.aspxapplicationsupdatingasinglefilewithdocumentlikedata relnofollowofficial microsoft recommendationa on how to ensure that a file, representing a particular state, is written in a consistent way is to write it into a temporary file and a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comrurulibrarywindowsdesktopaa36551228vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowReplaceFilea it.p  pBut if well assume a bit more higherlevel task  a change to the state represented in the file  it becomes a bit more problematic.p  pTo make a change to a state within a file, you need to read the state from the file, make the change and write it back. While the writing portion we may consider be covered by the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comrurulibrarywindowsdesktopaa36551228vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowReplaceFilea function, the fact that the file could have been changed since weve read it is not.p  pIn other words, we may need to check if the file is still the same and has not updated since, before the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comrurulibrarywindowsdesktopaa36551228vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowReplaceFilea call. If we are about talking text editors here  a modification time check before the call should be enough. But if we want something a bit more robust  we should acknowledge the possibility of file changing after the modification time check, but before the call.p  pThe naive approach would be to implement a strongCompareAndReplaceFilestrong call, that will lock the original file, check that its the same file, then replicating what a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comrurulibrarywindowsdesktopaa36551228vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowReplaceFilea does. Nor only this is a bit hacky solution copypasting logic of a system function is not a good practice, but it also implies a longer lock period.p  pFor instance, on Linux, the same effect could be achieved by utilizing a hrefhttpman7.orglinuxmanpagesman2fcntl.2.html relnofollowfcntl2as emFDSETLEASEem file leasing to have a chance of aborting your operation once someone else opens a file for writing, prior to a hrefhttpman7.orglinuxmanpagesman2rename.2.html relnofollowrename2a, which is atomic and does not open a file, so you can keep a lease through it.p  pAre there ways to implement a transactional file change on Windows, aside of a hacky solution discussed abovep

Negative 74354 pstrongQuestionstrongp  pIve just come across the concept of using update statements on CTEs. This seems a great approach, but Ive not seen it used before, and the context in which I was introduced to it i.e. uncovered it in some badly written code suggests the author didnt know what they were doing. Is anyone aware of any reason not to perform updates on CTEs  any considerations which should be made when doing so assuming the CTE gives some benefit such as to allow you to update an arbitrary subset of data.p  pstrongFull Infostrongp  pI recently found some horrendous code in our production environment where someone had clearly been experimenting on ways to update a single row or data.  Ive tidied up the layout to make it readable, but have left the original logic as is.  p  precodeCREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[getandupdateWorkOrder]       Add the parameters for the stored procedure here      p1 xml Output  AS BEGIN      WITH T AS               SELECT XMLDoc         , Retrieved          from [Transcode].[dbo].[WorkOrder]          where WorkOrderId IN                       SELECT TOP 1 WorkOrderId              FROM                               SELECT DISTINCTWorkOrderId                 , Retrieved                 FROM [Transcode].[dbo].[WorkOrder]                  WHERE Retrieved  0               as c                  AND Retrieved  0           UPDATE T     SET Retrieved  1     Output inserted.XMLDoc   END codepre  pI can easily update this to the below without affecting the logicp  precodeCREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetAndUpdateWorkOrder]  AS BEGIN      WITH T AS               SELECT top 1 XMLDoc         , Retrieved          from [WorkOrder]          where Retrieved  0           UPDATE T     SET Retrieved  1     Output inserted.XMLDoc   END codepre  pHowever the code also introduced me to a new concept that you could update CTEs  see those updates in the underlying tables Id previously assumed that CTEs were read only inmemory copies of the data selected from the original table, and thus not possible to amend. Had I not seen the original code, but needed something which behaved like this Id have written it as followsp  precodeCREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetAndUpdateWorkOrder]  AS BEGIN      UPDATE [WorkOrder]      SET Retrieved  1     Output inserted.XMLDoc      where Id in               select top 1 Id         from [WorkOrder]         where Retrieved  0         order by Id Id have included this too but not including here to ensure my rewrite is exactly the same as the original in terms of functionality, including the unpredictable part the bonus of not including this is a performance benefit though thats negligible given the data in this table       END codepre  pThe code which performs the update via the CTE looks much cleaner i.e. you dont even need to rely on a unique id for this to work. However because the rest of the original code is badly written Im apprehensive about this new technique, so want to see what the experts say about this approach before adding it to my arsenal.p
Negative 74354 pIm one step closer for completing my thesis but I have a question for you cause I dont know if the way Im doing it is right. First of all. I wanted to make a program that runs in the background and sends a message to someone with the users location when a new sms is received. I have a programm that has 3 different layouts. When the user opens the programm for the first time, a service is created that checks for new messages. The service also has a locationlistener that checks regularly for users location and save the longitude and the latitude in two variables. Although, the gps needs around 1 minute to find my location, in the end, it does. I dont know why it takes so long to find the location. So thats my first of the problems. A Broadcast Receiver is analysing the new sms and keeps the cellphone number. It creates a sms that has a link to Google Maps with the longitude and latitude of the user. One of the three layouts, is the Settings of the program that saves the users preferences using SharedPreferences and PreferenceManager. The second layout is about sending the users location manually and not automatically from the Service... I couldnt find a proper way to pass the values of the longitude and latitude from the service to the activity of the second layout so I made the service to save longitude and latitude using SharedPreferences.... Thats my second problem cause I think that this is kind of wrong. The Activity sends the users location with a sms when a button is being pushed. Now the third and final layout is about a map. There is a button in the third layout that saves the current location as users home using the SharedPreferences. Inside the onMapReady I have put the buttons OnClickListener so, when the map is ready, and the button is pressed, it will create a marker in the map that shows the users home. The users location is taken as in the Activity of the second layout with the SharedPreferences method. Which I dont know if is a correct way to use.... So am asking you guys, is it cool to use SharedPreferences that way Would be better if I save the longitude and latitude in a file Please any help or opinion will be appreciated...p

Negative 74354 pIm aware that there are plenty of methods to use SVG sprites in HTML. My preference to this date has been to use something like p  precodeltdiv classcontainergt    ltsvg classicongt      lttitlegtIcon Titlelttitlegt      ltuse xlinkhrefsvgsprite.svgicongt    ltsvggt ltdivgt codepre  pHowever, now I wanted to load the sprite from a subdomain, like thisp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt    ltsvg classicongt      lttitlegtIcon Titlelttitlegt      ltuse xlinkhrefhttpssub.domain.comsvgspritehome.svgicongt    ltsvggt ltdivgt codepre  pUnfortunately, this doesnt work as the file is not fetched. Ive tried with codeltobjectgtcode as well, but that doesnt seem to work either. p  pSo far, Im only able to usep  precodeltphp includeoncehttpssub.domain.comsvgsprite.svg gt codepre  pIts ok as a quick fix, as this doesnt involve much refactoring. However, this also means the HTML gets bloated. p  pWith the codeltusegtcode method the sprite gets cached. But with the codeincludecode method the sprite isnt cached, only gets embedded, and so it is far from ideal. p  pDoes anybody use any alternative to the php include method that is compatible with cross domain requests and browser cachingp

Negative 74354 pUsing codeYii2code Ill need to provide a codeDataProvidercode with specific data.  The problem is that I need to create a single codeDataProvidercode with an array data and data from a table in a database. p  pTherefore, I think that I should mix an codeArrayDataProvidercode and an codeActiveDataProvidercode. I dont know if codeYii2code offers tools for this situations or should I create my own codeDataProvidercode from codeBaseDataProvidercode.p  pI cant post some code because is a knowledge question.p
