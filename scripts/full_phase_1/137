Positive 137 pI referred a tutorial app from Google playstore named AllTech where it is said that java is not a fully object oriented language as it is using PRIMITIVE TYPE.p  pI would like to know why it is not fully object oriented language as it is using primitive type. Every object oriented language would have primitive type. p  pSo what a language needs to have to be fully object oriented languagep  pThanks for your valuable time for looking into this.p
Positive 137 pIs it correct that in languages like Java and C you are forced to program object oriented, while in other languages like Python and R you can do so, but you dont have to. Are there terms which separate these two concepts.p

Positive 137 pTo exercise my OOP abilities on Scalaspecific features, I have tried to design a game where I have a codePlayercode class. It has an abstract method codeplaycode which decides, given a list of players different from the player the method is called on, what action to take. I wanted to prevent the codeplaycode method to alter the state of this other players. The right way to play is to cast a codeSpellcode and let the system reflect its effect on other players. p  pYet, the codeplaycode method needs read access to the other players to decide a strategy.

Positive 137 pLogEvent represents information like log level, message, user, process name, ... Some of these properties values require pretty much effort for generation, e. g. the process name. Those properties generated values are emusuallyem not changed, BUT despite this fact it should be possible to change them. p  pI considered the prototype pattern starting with a protoype, whose generic properties are preallocated. The protoype stays the same object during the lifetime of the application, but its properties values might change as described above. New LogEvent objects should use the current prototypes values, objects created before the change should continue using the old values, that means, referencing the prototype from the real LogEvent object is not an option.p  pHowever the real LogEvent requires some properties to be not null, whereas this requirement is not useful for the prototype. I would like to prevent invalid objects of LogEvent. However if I use usual protoype pattern I would have to add a constructor to create the prototype, but this constructor would not create a valid object and I want to avoid, that an invalid object the prototype itself or a clone of it is used accidentally.p  pI spent some time on searching a solution, but the approaches listed below are pretty ugly.

Positive 137 pI dont know if this question fits this site, but Ill ask anyway What are the downsides of using static getters For my website, I use CodeIgniter and I coded a finder function in MYModel.php. The individual Models use this model as a parent and just kind of mirror the database. I would use my finder method to get an object of a model and then with the static getter  also declared in MYModel.php  get the attributes. Like sop  precodeltphp article  Articlefindarray     id gt someId,  echo Articlegetarticle, title codepre  por for example if I have to edit an entry, I can just do it like thisp  precodeltphp article  Articlefindarray     id gt someId,  Articlesetarticle, title, theTitle        gtsetarticle, text, theText if articlegtupdate      return false  return true codepre  pThe first real downside I know is, that it completely goes against the Thin Controller, Fat Model principle, since Id only declare the variables in the model, mirroring the table fields plus maybe some individual functions. But it completely erases the necessity to write getter and setter functions for every attribute.p

The current schema was badly designed, many attributes that constitute a single codeUnidadecode entity are spread out in 3 tables, each table created specifically for that codeUnidadecode with only one row, they switched rows for tables and a fourth that has a row for each codeUnidadecode entity follows the correct convention.p  pDue to this situation I was recommended to use the repository interface, so I could easily integrate a new database schema in the future while unifying those 4 tables in a single database interface.p  pThis is what I havep  precodepublic function createObjectun       produto        thisgtconfigRepositorygtgetProdutoun     ultimoNivel    thisgtconfigRepositorygtgetDataUltimoNivelun     nivelEstimado  thisgtconfigRepositorygtgetUltimoNivelun     ultimaMedia    thisgtconfigRepositorygtgetDataUltimaMediaun     mediaInterna   thisgtconfigRepositorygtgetUltimaMediaun     nrCabos        thisgtconfigRepositorygtgetQtdCabosTotalun     nivelLivre     thisgtconfigRepositorygtgetNivelEstimadoLivreun      nCabosLaterais  thisgtconfigRepositorygtgetQtdCaboLateralun     nSensoresCabosLaterais  thisgtconfigRepositorygtgetQtdSensorCaboLateralun     nSensoresCaboCentral  thisgtconfigRepositorygtgetQtdSensorCaboCentralun                Im creating a generic object      unidade  object compact         produto,          ultimoNivel,          nivelEstimado,          ultimaMedia,          mediaInterna,          nrCabos,          nivelLivre,         arquivoCss               return unidade  codepre  pSorry for the variables in portuguese, but what those codeconfigRepositorycode methods do basically is query the database for some configuration option it is actually an attribute and return it, like number of cables, space occupied, some dates and basic information.

Each time you scroll up to look, the system adds more information, so the only way to view it is to disconnect the hardware.p  pId love to know if anyone has a way of redirecting the output from Tornadop  pI was hoping there might be a way to log it all from a small python app so that I can apply filters to the incoming information.

Negative 137 pFor one and a half years, I have been keeping my eyes on the git community in hopes of making the switch away from SVN.  One particular issue holding me back is the inability to lock binary files. Throughout the past year I have yet to see developments on this issue.  I understand that locking files goes against the fundamental principles of distributed source control, but I dont see how a web development company can take advantage of git to track source code and image file changes when there is the potential for binary file conflicts.p  pTo achieve the effects of locking, a central repository must be identified.  Regardless of the distributed nature of git, most companies will have a central repository for a software project.  We should be able to mark a file as requiring a lock from the governing git repository at a specified address.  Perhaps this is made difficult because git tracks file contents not filesp  pDo any of you have experience in dealing with git and binary files that should be locked before modificationp  pNOTE It looks like Source Gears new open source distributed version control project, Veracity, has locking as one of its goals.p

This trigger would then use cursors to go through the INSERTED table, checking each record. If any record conflicted with an existing record, an error would be raised. The two problems I have with this approach are I dislike using cursors in a modern version of SQL Server, and Im not sure how to go about implimenting the same logic for UPDATEs. There may also be the complexity of records within INSERTED conflicting with each other.p  pThe second, seemingly better, approach would be to create a CONSTRAINT that calls a user defined function, passing the PatrolID, GuardID, Starts and Ends. The function would then do a WHERE EXISTS query checking for any records that overlap the GuardIDStartsEnds parameters that are not the original PatrolID record. However Im not sure of what potential side effects this approach might have.p  pIs the second approach better Does anyone see any pitfalls, such as when insertingupdating multiple rows at once here Im concerned because rows within that group could conflict, meaning the order they are inserted makes a difference. Is there a better way of doing this such as some fancy INDEX trickp

Negative 137 pI encountered a strange problem with our Windows C  .NET application. Actually it is a GUI application, my job is the included network component, encapsulated in an assembly. strongI do not know the code of the mainGUI applicationstrong, I could contact its developer though.p  pNow the applications UI has buttons to Start and Stop the network engine. Both buttons work. To make my component threadsafe I am using a lock around three methods. I dontt want a client to be able to call Stop before Start finished. Additinally there is a Polling Timer.p  pI tried to show you as few lines as possible and simpified the problem p  precodeprivate Timer actionTimer  new Timernew                 TimerCallbackactionTimerTimerCallback,                 null, Timeout.Infinite, Timeout.Infinite  public void Start   lock driverLock     active  true    Trigger the first timer event in 500ms   actionTimer.Change500, Timeout.Infinite     private void actionTimerTimerCallbackobject state   lock driverLock     if active return   log.DebugBefore event   StatusEventthis, new StatusEventArgs  it hangs here   log.DebugAfter event    Now restart timer   actionTimer.Change500, Timeout.Infinite     public void Stop   lock driverLock     active  false    codepre  pHere is how to reproduce my problem. As I said, the Start and Stop buttons both work, but if you press Start, and strongduring the execution of the TimerCallback press Stopstrong, this prevents the TimerCallback to return. It hangs exactly at the same position, the StatusEvent. So the lock is never released and the GUI also hangs, because its call of the Stop method cannot proceed.p  pstrongNow I observed the following If the application hangs because of this deadlock and I click on the application in the task bar with the right mouse button, it continues. It just works as expected then. Anybody has an explanation or better a solution for thisstrongp  pBy the way, I also tried it with InvokeIfRequired as I dont know the internas of the GUI application. This is neccesary if my StatusEvent would change something in the GUI. Since I have no reference to the GUI controls, I used assuming only one targetp  precodeDelegate firstTarget  StatusEvent.GetInocationList[0] ISynchronizeInvoke syncInvoke  firstTarget.Target as ISynchronizeInvoke if syncInvoke.InvokeRequired    syncInvoke.InvokefirstTarget, new object[]  this, new StatusEventArgs   else    firstTarget.Method.InvokefirstTarget.Target, new object[]  this, new StatusEventArgs   codepre  pThis approach didnt change the problem. I think this is because I am Invoking on the main applications event handlers, not on the GUI controls. So the main app is responsible for Invoking But anyway, AFAIK not using Invoke although needed would not result in a deadlock like this but hopefully in an exception.p

Im developing a Bible reader application that would import translations from XML to core data SQL. Currently only one translation can be in use. Currently I only have different MOC and PS for each translation since the model is the same. I do believe, however, if you say that the stack should be created as a whole. The translations have no connections between each other, so there is no actual reason for using the same stack. The only thing that could complicate this would be notesbookmarksetc that will reference to the active translation. The references, however, will be textual so again there is no necessary need for a shared stack.p  pThank you for your input.p

Negative 137 pI am new to Spring and the bean concept, so sorry if asking the obviously. I have set up a Java project and used the Hibernate framework to make my connections to the DB using hibernate tool on eclipse, really recommended btw.  My basic setup was as followsp  ol lisome hibernate pojos generated by Hibernate tools,li lihibernate mapping files hbm.xml files. li liThe configuration was set in hibernate.cfg.xml file placed at my root of the packages.li liI initially setup a HibernateUtils class that gets a session from my sessionFactory.li lisome classes that act as Dao  creates the queries using the pojos and the hibernateUtils to get the session.li ol  pThis was working fine with hibernates powerful framework. Then I migrated to project to Spring MVC. From the various tutorials I read I understood that some changes need to be done in order to make things play nicely again. The main change is that the Spring FW now loads the beans by itself, therefore the followingp  ol lithe pojos did not change, nor did the hbm.xml filesli liThe configuration is no longer set at hibernate.cfg.xml  the Spring MVC FW loads its own LocalSessionFactoryBean once I declared it in the XML files Spring search for xmls as part of the initialization process. So I created a separate xml file called springhibernate.xml, that has the DB definition, the session factory bean and a hibernate template. To complete it, the xml file also declare the location of the Dao and the hbm files.li liwith hibernate template configured in the xml, there is a bean injection, therefore I changed the Dao files to add gettersetter to a hibernate template property. Then using this  the Dao class may create the db query.  li ol  pAll of this configuration works fine and I can get the Spring FW initialize the Dao classes I put a sysout just to confirm that the Dao classes are injected with the hibernate template during MVC startup. Now my problem is  how to get access to the Dao bean instance created p  pIn my logic part, I get a hold of the bean as followsp  pcodeClassPathXmlApplicationContext appContex  new ClassPathXmlApplicationContextnew String[] springhibernate.xmlp  pUserUIDDao userUIDDao  UserUIDDaoappContext.getBeanUserUIDDao codep  pProblem is  this is a NEW reference to a newly created bean and not the same one created during the spring MVC startup. p  pSo my questions are how to get a hold of the original bean created by the Spring init process and  is my setup correctp

Im talking about real applications used in real companies, like a hrefhttpava.ijji.com relnofollowIjjia and a hrefhttpvindictus.nexon.net relnofollowNexona.p  pBasically, from their websites you can click a Start Game button, which will launch an executable located at cijjienglish or cnexon[gamename] respectively.

The applications can also be launched through command line [as opposed to going to the game hosts website].p  pI figured this would be possible if the application created an ActiveX object to call for the creation of a new process.  However, the websites are able to launch applications from multiple browsers other than Internet Explorer, including chrome, which, to my knowledge, does not implement ActiveX.  p  pObviously the people developing these applications use their own means to do this.  p  pFrom looking at the services list as well as currently running applications list, I have no indication that theyre running something like gameLaunchingServer.exe which listens to some obscure port for an incoming connection [to be accessed using iframe  HTTP Protocol] and responds by launching an application...p  pIm stumped, and this is sort of stuck in my mind.

Negative 137 pthis is probably a silly question and I have the answer myself but I want to know if I am doing anything wrong. I have a website, lets call it codewww.mysite.comcode. Within this site, I have some FAQs but the person that built the site saved the FAQ pages under a directory on the site named FAQs. p  pAs an example an FAQ page would be located at p  pcodewww.mysite.compagesenfaqsfaqpage1.htmlcode. p  pNote the codepagesencode directory. Ideally I would like all the pages to be saved under codewww.mysite.comindex.htmlcode etc but I cant change this.p  pAnyway, when I am on any of these FAQ pages, and I try to link back to say the home page codeindex.htmlcode the navigation wont go to the page. So for example, when I am onp  pcodewww.mysite.compagesenfaqsfaqpage1.htmlcode p  pand I try to link back to the home page p  pcodewww.mysite.compagesenindex.htmlcode which is where the index page is saved the nav wont work. Instead it will try to go to codewww.mysite.compagesenfaqsindex.htmlcode. p  pNow I am assuming this happens because I am in the faq directory, but how do I go back to the root directory when linking The code for the link is simply codelta hrefindex.htmlgtHomeltagtcode. I could of course just put in the full link codewww.mysite.compagesenindex.htmlcode, which would solve this but is there another way around this Sorry for such a long post and I may have been able to explain this better but I cant Sp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 137 pI am working on an application in which all performance values for a given item are primitives. However, there is now the possibility that one of these values  Revenue  is not  available when adding new data to the system. In these cases we are fine with simply storingdisplaying the value for Revenue as 0.00p  pHowever, we now also want to be able to add this missing data at a later date but not overwrite data if present. Rather than adding flags to indicate whether Revenue was actually available when 0.00 was added to the database, it seems obvious to me to change Revenue from the primitive type double to a boxed primitive Double, and allow NULLS for the Revenue column in the db.p  pThere are various places in the application where getRevenue is called however, and mathematic operations are performed upon the value. Obviously now having the potential for getRevenue to return null could cause major problems. As I mentioned though, we are perfectly happy to present Revenue as having a value of 0.00 in the cases where there is no value present.p  pSo, it seems like an obvious solution would be to update the getRevenue method to return the value, or 0.00 in the case of the value being null. And to add a new method getRevenueDB which returns the true value of Revenue, including null. This method would only be called when accessing the value to add to the db.p  pHow does this seems as a solution It shouold work, and is quick. But does this seem a horribly dirty solution, for which there is a better option availablep  pAll comments are much appreciatedp

Negative 137 pI apologize in advance for the length, the solution may well be trivial, just wanted to be as informative as I could.p  pstrongThe Tablesstrongp  pI have two tables of note  items and products, which is a 1 to many relationship.  One item can have multiple product which are variations in color and material.  Brand is an external category table that doesnt have to much part to play in this select statement.p  pSo an item is, for example, a specific shoe, e.g. a park avenue shoe.

As an unfortunate result, those without at least one default set dont show up in the search.p  pstrongCurrent Select Statementstrongp  pHere is the current select, which filters out everything that

Negative 137 pIn my a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5550896siftandsurffeatureextractionimplementationusingmatlablast questiona I asked about SIFT and SURF implementation in MATLAB source codes and several links were received. Thanks for all. Now, I have another question. These SIFT implementations are like libraries that we are using for an example when coding c programming, we are including iostream library. But we dont have to change any code which is inside that library right. So, I can just use these SIFT implementations as a library and do not need to change any code for my images right That means sift implementation is working for any image Can someone please help mep

Negative 137 pSo here is the situationp  pI have an assembly called Lib1.dll. For some reason not relevant to the question I had to rename the assembly file name to Lib1New.dll, now while trying to load the renamed assembly using Assembly.LoadFile I noticed that the CLR tries to load the Lib1.dll as well. p  pIf Lib1.dll is found in the search path it gets loaded in the address space. The application works fine irrespective of whether Lib1.dll was found or not. The problem is that if Lib1.dll is found the file gets locked and cant be deleted by other processes.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxtn0X.png altenter image description herep  pI dont understand why the LoadFile searches and loads Lib1.dll. LoadFile is supposed to load the contents of an assembly file on the specified location, why is it searching for files. p  pMSDN documentation for LoadFilep  blockquote   pUse the LoadFile method to load and examine assemblies that have the same identity, but are located in different paths. LoadFile does not load files into the LoadFrom context, and does not resolve dependencies using the load path, as the LoadFrom method does. LoadFile is useful in this limited scenario because LoadFrom cannot be used to load assemblies that have the same identities but different paths it will load only the first such assembly.p blockquote

Negative 137 pI have a problem with texture mapping in Android using OpenGL . Basically the problem is, that most of the Squares my class I use for drawing 2 triangles are drawn properly, that is the textures on them are exactly as they should be and everything is sweet. But some Squares are drawn a bit weirdly. Basically every next horizontal line starting from the top gets drawn about 1 pixel shifted to the left. This is an example image a hrefhttppostimage.orgimage1la0mr99g relnofollowhttppostimage.orgimage1la0mr99ga and this is how it gets drawn the button above is the one that is exactly the same, but different texture a hrefhttppostimage.orgimage1lafildpg relnofollowhttppostimage.orgimage1lafildpgap  pThis is the class that is responsible for drawing images to screen. I must also add, that once a Square gets created I keep using and would potentially remap some textures later, but this is not the case for the images that get drawn wrong in fact some other images Ive remapped textures for get drawn fine. So basically, by looking at the code Ive no idea what could be going wrong, as most of the Squares get drawn properly, and there is no bug visible to me. Also, I actually have 2 buttons, and they are exactly the same sizes and their images are also the same size  but one of the gets drawn just fine, whereas the other gets skewed. The code for creating those buttons is literally the same, so Im totally at a loss at what is going wrong.p  precodepublic class GLSquare  private float width, height private FloatBuffer vertexBuffer    buffer holding the vertices private float vertices[]             1.0f, 1.0f,  0.0f,         V1  bottom left          1.0f, 1.0f,  0.0f,         V2  top left          1.0f, 1.0f,  0.0f,         V3  bottom right          1.0f,  1.0f,  0.0f          V4  top right   private FloatBuffer textureBuffer   buffer holding the texture coordinates private float texture[]                     Mapping coordinates for the vertices          0.0f, 1.0f,      top left     V2          0.0f, 0.0f,      bottom left  V1          1.0f, 1.0f,      top right    V4          1.0f, 0.0f       bottom right V3    The texture pointer  private int[] textures  new int[1]  public GLSquarefloat width, float height      this.width  width     this.height  height     vertices  new float[12]     vertices[0]  width2 vertices[1]  height2 vertices[2]  0.0f V1  bottom left     vertices[3]  width2 vertices[4]  height2 vertices[5]   0.0f V2  top left     vertices[6]  width2 vertices[7]  height2 vertices[8]   0.0f V3  bottom right     vertices[9]  width2 vertices[10]  height2 vertices[11]  0.0f V4  top right       a float has 4 bytes so we allocate for each coordinate 4 bytes     ByteBuffer byteBuffer  ByteBuffer.allocateDirectvertices.length  4     byteBuffer.orderByteOrder.nativeOrder       allocates the memory from the byte buffer     vertexBuffer  byteBuffer.asFloatBuffer       fill the vertexBuffer with the vertices     vertexBuffer.putvertices       set the cursor position to the beginning of the buffer     vertexBuffer.position0      byteBuffer  ByteBuffer.allocateDirecttexture.length  4     byteBuffer.orderByteOrder.nativeOrder     textureBuffer  byteBuffer.asFloatBuffer     textureBuffer.puttexture     textureBuffer.position0  public float getWidth     return width  public float getHeight     return height  public void loadGLTextureGL10 gl, Bitmap bitmap       Generate a texture pointer     gl.glGenTextures1, textures, 0      Bind texture to array     gl.glBindTextureGL10.GLTEXTURE2D, textures[0]       create nearest filtered texture     gl.glTexParameterfGL10.GLTEXTURE2D, GL10.GLTEXTUREMINFILTER, GL10.GLNEAREST     gl.glTexParameterfGL10.GLTEXTURE2D, GL10.GLTEXTUREMAGFILTER, GL10.GLLINEAR       Use Android GLUtils to specify a twodimensional texture image from our bitmap      GLUtils.texImage2DGL10.GLTEXTURE2D, 0, bitmap, 0       Clean up     bitmap.recycle     public void drawGL10 gl, float x, float y, float scaleX, float scaleY, float angle       gl.glPushMatrix       bind the previously generated texture     gl.glBindTextureGL10.GLTEXTURE2D, textures[0]       Point to our buffers     gl.glEnableClientStateGL10.GLVERTEXARRAY     gl.glEnableClientStateGL10.GLTEXTURECOORDARRAY       Set the face rotation     gl.glFrontFaceGL10.GLCW       Point to our vertex buffer     gl.glVertexPointer3, GL10.GLFLOAT, 0, vertexBuffer     gl.glTexCoordPointer2, GL10.GLFLOAT, 0, textureBuffer      translate to the wanted x,y coord     gl.glTranslatefx, y, 0.0f      ifangle  0.0f         gl.glRotatefangle, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f                   ifscaleX  1.0f ampamp scaleY  1.0f         gl.glScalefscaleX, scaleY, 0.0f                   Draw the vertices as triangle strip     gl.glDrawArraysGL10.GLTRIANGLESTRIP, 0, vertices.length  3      Disable the client state before leaving     gl.glDisableClientStateGL10.GLVERTEXARRAY     gl.glDisableClientStateGL10.GLTEXTURECOORDARRAY      gl.glPopMatrix  codepre  pp

Negative 137 pI have an existing database SQL Server which has several tables connected using primaryforeign key relationships.

I have a simple service that pulls down the data from the remote system but am now struggling to see how I can use my CoreData model to persist this data on the device.p  pAs CoreData is an object graph and not a database I do not know how I can preserve my primaryforeign key relationships as this is a CoreData implementation detail abstracted away from the developer. The data I have in my remote system relies on these already formed relationships to function correctly.p  pDoes anybody out there know how to solve this issue or has come across it before Or am I coming at this from the wrong anglep  pEither way I need some way of replicating my remote data onto a MaciOS device.p  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 137 pThis question has been asked before, but digging into the documentation for the various development tools it seems like this emisem possible, just not obvious.p  pMotivation   Making a static library for use by other iOS developers.  Some symbols in the library will cause problems if exported so I wish to make them internalonly symbols.  With a dynamic library this is easy, just use codeexportedsymbolslistcode codelibtoolcode codeldcode argument and list the ones you want public.  codelibtoolcode documentation will not allow this argument for static libraries.p  pLibrary has several ObjectiveC .m files that use code from each other.  Only one class in the group needs to be made public to users of the final .a static library file.p  pTried codelibtool exportedsymbolslist publicsymbols.expcode but that argument to codelibtoolcode is not supported with codestaticcode for static libraries.p  pCant make the symbols private with attributes if thatd even work because they are needed by the other .m files in the group.p  plooks like codeldcode can take several .o files and link them together into a new .o file via the codercode argument and it doesnt have the dynamic only disclaimer for the codeexportedsymbolslistcode argument which could just be unclear documentation....p  pjust as a test I build my project with Xcode so I have all the .o files made, and then try to call codeldcode on the command line, like sop  precodeld r x allload static arch armv6 syslibroot path     filelist UsersDadABCsdkiphoneABClibbuildABCLib.buildDistributioniphoneosABCLibdevice.buildObjectsnormalarmv6ABCsdk.LinkFileList     exportedsymbolslist exp file path o outputfile.o codepre  pwhere the path type things have long paths to the appropriate places in there.p  pbut I get errors like the followingp  blockquote   pusrbinldclassic UsersDadABCsdkiphoneABClibbuildABCLib.buildDistributioniphoneosABCLibdevice.buildObjectsnormalarmv6ABCmain.o incompatible, file contains unsupported type of section 3 emTEXT,empicsymbolstub4 in load command 0 must specify dynamic to be usedp blockquote  pso something seems wrong there...p  pAnyone know a clever way to make this work  Thanks.p

Negative 137 pIm finding that what Ive considered best practice for use namespace in c is hurting the readability of my code, and making me question how to use them well.p  pMy program consists of a few different modules which are mostly built into libraries that the main application uses. Each library uses its own namespace, and their namespaces are all inside a project namespace to help project against name conflicts with 3rd party code. So I end up with class names such as myprojectloggingLogger and myprojectreportingReportType As made up examples.p  pSo far so good. And in my .cpp files I have no problem. I use using myprojectlogging at the top for example, and can cleanly refer to my Logging class. In the unlikely event of a conflict between two of my namespaces I can just explicitly say which one I want. This works well.p  pHeader files are different though. Its considered bad practice to put using statements into header files as they will affect unrelated code that may not expect them. So I always fully qualify all the names in .hpp files. That was somewhat ugly but managable up to now so Ive put up with it. But now Im increasing using template code in my libraries which means that there is emmuch moreem actual code in my .hpp files now. And having to fully qualify every name is making the code practically unreadable due to the length of type names.p  pIm starting to feel that the benefits of namespaces and best practice for using them are beginning to be outweighed by the unreadablilty of the code Im having to write. Im starting to wonder if I would be better abandoning the use of namespaces to gain the benefit of more readable code and fixing any name conflicts if and when they appear.p  pAn alternative is to use short, single layer namespaces so instead of myprojectloggingLogger I would merely have logLogger which would help a lot but make the likelyhood of namespace conflicts much higher, and also have the namespaces convey less useful information.p  pAs Ive said, this only really affects code in .hpp files as Im happily using using namespace in my implementation files to make this manageable, but it emisem becoming a problem as I look at my templated code in .hpp files now and think eww.... which cant be good Pp  pAnyone got any practical advicep

Negative 137 pIm building a Silverlight app where users select photos from their computer, edit an associated titledescriptiontags etc. and then upload to a web server via WCF. Actually everythings working perfectly just with a emlittleem problem. I want to show the thumbnails of the photos in a list before uploading, and to achieve that, the only way I know is to load the file and then process it. If the users selects about 20 files, codesllauncher.execode eats huge amount of RAM, around a gigabyte well it could be more than normal for Photoshop3ds max, or Firefox that has run for an half an hour, but it IS too much for a web photo uploader app, and when I try to upload the images, the app even tries to load more and crashes completely. I want to be able to upload more photos, like a hundred or more, at a time, but how can I achieve that emwhile still having the thumbnail functionalityem One thing is queuing the uploads and therefore the loading of the files, but it would cause the thumbnails also not to load. Any suggestionsp
Negative 137 pIm writing a code to work through sockets in java. Ive created a multicast group to which anybody can join on the LAN. But the LAN has many different networks, operated by a router, and the multicast group created by the code would be different in different network and if a person multicasts something to the multicast group in the network A it will only be received by the people joined to the group in that network only, and not by all the peoples in different networks.p  pFor Example p  pThe multicast group is, lets say, 224.0.0.1. And the LAN has 2 different networks.p  pNetwork A  172.22.28.0255.255.254.0p  pNetwork B  172.22.30.0255.255.254.0p  pThen there will be two different multicast group, with the same address as 224.0.0.1, in the two different networks.p  pMy problem is How can I multicast over these two diff. networks on the LAN through javap  pAs I was searching for the solution, I came across the concept of a hrefhttpwww.networksorcery.comenpprotocolipip.htm relnofollowIP ENCAPSULATIONa, in which I can add an outer ip address to the packet, so that it can go through different networks.

Negative 137 pFirst off, Im not sure if this is actually a legal question to ask here on StackOverflow since it is not really about programming, but more on the frontendpart.p  pIm about to create a webpage which acts like a diasshow in fullscreen. Creating the actual diasshow isnt a problem at all, but it needs to run on emallem screensizes, all the way from an iMac 27 with its very high resolutions, full HD tv screens and all the way down to an iPad.p  pWhat I have done so far is to style every single element with percents. The design looks good on my own 22 screen and on my 42 tv, but when its shown on i.e. an iPad or iMac or even a difference size tv, it doesnt fit the screen. If its shown on the 27 iMac it only fills up the 14 of the screen and on iPad, the elements are too large to display.p  pI feel like I have overlooked something here  or is it just plainout impossible to create a fullscreen webdesign that works on all monitorsp  pAny helpinput on this is greatly appreciated p  pThanks a lot in advance.p  ul liBoli ul  pEDIT I took a few screenshots for youp  pFirst the iMac 27p  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacfirefox1920x1080.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacfirefox1920x1080.pngap  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacfirefox2560x1440.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacfirefox2560x1440.pngap  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacsafari1920x1080.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacsafari1920x1080.pngap  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacsafari2560x1440.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowimacsafari2560x1440.pngap  pAnd the TVp  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvfirefox1080itv.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvfirefox1080itv.pngap  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvfirefox720ptv.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvfirefox720ptv.pngap  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvsafari1080itv.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvsafari1080itv.pngap  pa hrefhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvsafari720ptv.png relnofollowhttpwww.bomortensen.dkslideshowtvsafari720ptv.pngap  pAnd the link to the solution p  pa hrefhttpgrenaabilhus.mercatusdemocms.dk relnofollowhttpgrenaabilhus.mercatusdemocms.dkap

Negative 137 pI am currently writing some code that has to be portable. For that purpose I am using the pimpl idiom since I think it seperates the actual implementations cleanly from the API. Anyways, the pimpl idiom only works very great if the implementations dont share code i.e. some generic functions that are shared across implementations.p  pThe other option would be abstract interfaces i guess. Anyways since I am using pimpl across my whole project I really dont think its a good idea to mix it with abstract interfaces on the API level.p  pSo what options would you suggest to share code across different pimpls I thought about an abstract interface class for the pimpl itself, so that the actual API is still cleanly separated, but that seems like a weird idea too. p  pPS I dont want to discuss if pimpl or abstract interfaces are better. From an API perspective I made the decision to go with pimpl and Id like to stick with it.p

I need to perform an action when all the ajax requests have finished loading or are completed.p  pFor this, I am using Ext.Ajax.isLoading in a recursive function in following wayp  precodefunction chechValid     ifExt.Ajax.isLoading         checkValid     else         Code for Action 1      EOF  checkValid  Code for Action 2 codepre  pThe problem is that when I do this, browsers give the following errorsp  pMozill FF  too much recursionsp  pIE  Stack overflow at line18134p  pIf this recursion is a heavy thing for the browsers, then how to perform a task when all the Ajax requests have finished loadingp  pUsing delay is not what I want as, if delay is used then browser begins executing the other code like Code for Action 2 as shared above which is not what is expected. p  pThe main aim is that the browser shouldnt execute anything unless all the Ajax requests are complete and once completed then it should perform a particular action.p  pAny suggestionshelp on this onep  pThanks in Advance.p  pPS Using ExtJs 4.0.7p  pstrongUpdatedMore Detail about the actual situationstrongp  pHere is brief description of the situtaion being faced   There is a form, in which I need to perform server side validations on various fields. I am doing so by firing an ajax request on blur event. Depending upon the server response of validation Ajax fired on blur, fields are marked invalid and form submission is not allowed. Avoiding change event as that causes alot of overhead on server due to high number of Ajas requests and also leads to fluctuating effects on a field when response from various such Ajax requests are received. p  pThings are working fine except in one case  when user modifies the value of a field and instead of tabbing out from the field she directly clicks at the save button. In such a case, though, the blur event gets fired but the processing of Save doesnt wait for Ajax Validation response and submits the form. Thus, I somehow need to check if Ajax requests have finihed loading and the process the saving of form. requestComplete would unfortunately not serve the purpose here. And if try using the recursion, then of course, the browser is hung due to high usage of resources. Same case occurs if I try using a pause script work around  as shared here  a hrefhttpwww.devcheater.com relnofollowJavascript Sleepa.p  pAny possible workaround for this onep  pTIAp
Negative 137 pI have a fairly straightforward setup in which a RemoteIO unit is taking input, doing a bit of processing, sending it out the output, and writing the output to a file.  Right now, Im just generating test signals inside of my RemoteIO render callback, so I dont really care about anything coming from the actual input.  My render callback is called and works a treat in the simulator, but is never called at all when run on the phone.  Any ideas where I should start looking  Am happy to post codejust not sure what everyone would like to see...p

Negative 137 pIve got a pretty simple MERGE query where the source table is only about 41MB and the target table is about 4GB.

Its already run 15mins and not completed. Just wondering if there are any options for speeding up execution or if Im doing something wrong.

Negative 137 pIm trying to fix a a hrefhttpsgithub.comitsalifezMark relnofollowsmall jQuery plugina which turns an HTML checkbox into a graphical one. The problem Im facing is that if I change the checked property on the checkbox, the codechangecode event doesnt get triggered, and therefore the graphical represntation doesnt get updated.p  pObviously, I can just trigger the change event manually when I change the property, but Id like to find a more general solution that will be contained within the plugin. p  pSearching around, I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma83922797581this answera, which pointed me towards propHooks, which I can use to get notified whenever a property gets set. So I can write thisp  precodejQuery.propHooks.checked       set function el, value          el.checked  value         el.triggerchange       codepre  pAnd now the change event gets triggered whenever the property gets set. p  pMy concern is, that this is not very localized. Now Ive changed the way jQuery behaves for everything on the page, just for the sake of this small plugin. Futhermore, Im not sure what happens if two plugins on the page happen to use the same technique. Will the event get triggered twice, or will the second hook overwrite the first Either behavior seems problematic.p  pIm having a hard time finding any documentation of propHooks. Whats the proper way to use itp

Negative 137 pI wish to implement a simulator for a subset of instructions for the x86 architecture. Given a binary, I wish to disassemble it and run a simulation on the instructions. For that, one would need to look at certain bits of an instruction to decide whether it is a control instruction, arithmetic instruction or a logical instruction and based on that, one must derive the parameters of the operation by looking at the remaining bits. One obvious yet painful way to implement this is by using nested ifelseswitchcase statements. Can someone suggest a better methodology for implementing thisp

My question is whether there is equivalent functionality in Java or if a similar approach is even considered best practices in the Java incarnation of AppEngine. p  pDoes Java have an alternate way to achieve this functionality, or is there some alternate paradigm for how Java Servlets handle this sort of thingp  pI am aware that the web.xml file gives you the opportunity to map urls to servelets, but Im not sure if thats the proper way. p  pWhats the standard way that one might map URLs in the Java version of AppEngine to have different functionality triggered by different URLsp  pThanks.p

Negative 137 pWhile testing my inapppurchases, I am receiving these in my console for both attached devices and simulators. Can anyone suggest what might be wrong with my build My app has been submitted to the store and is currently waiting for review. p  pProblem in iTunes connect configuration for product com.mugunthkumar.subinapptest.wk1 Problem in iTunes connect configuration for product com.mugunthkumar.caltasks.propack Problem in iTunes connect configuration for product com.mugunthkumar.inappsubtest.consumable1p  pWhile testing on devices, I also have seen this message. It may be related. I dont have entitlements checked on the summary. I did not set up the provisioning profiles, so I cannot say how the iCloud was configured on them.p
Negative 137 pim programming a system which records users achievements in games by collecting Trophy data which is uploaded to the system, it got it to work fine but i have started to think about one part of the system i can do in 2 different waysp  pthis part of the system gathers a Trophys rank Bronze, Silver, Gold, Crystal, Jade and how many points its worth, each user as a record in a games table, each field apart from the tables primary key and the userid foreign key represent each trophy that can be obtained in the exact order they are listed, this means they arent sorted in any way which a machine can easily search thoughp  phow i have combat this is that there is another table which each record contains the game and a string which lists the rank order of the trophies separated by s so when i use explodeSTRING, i get an array and each index of the array is a single character, it can look something like thisp  pbbsgcgsjp  pthat is just the trophy rank, the point value is done though function where i pass the game id and trophy id and a switch case statement will first check what game i have passed while nested switch cases in each case will check the id, in each case of these they return the point value of a trophyp  pnaturally i didnt plan out my code, the rank string above originally didnt have the  and i didnt do the point values like that cause unlike the rank, a score value van very between 1 and 3 digits, now i know i can do the same with the point value as i did with the rank orderp  pi want to know which method is more efficient for the web server and for browsers, pulling a string from a database and using explodeSTRING, and intval to convert the point values from strings to integers, need them like that for calculations or calling a function with switch case statement like a look up table or if what i already have is efficient enoughp  pim not really interested in trying to do what i am doing in a completely different way just to make it even more efficient as these methods perfectly fit the nested loops in which i am using them inp

Negative 137 pI write a program to implement environment mapping using OpenGL and Cg shader language.But the result is not very right.When calculate the color of the model,we will blend the reflection with a decal texture.A uniform parameter called strongreflectivitystrong allows the application to control how reflective the material is.p  pFirstly I list my fragment Cg codep  precodevoid mainffloat2 texCoord  TEXCOORD0,     float3 R  TEXCOORD1,      out float4 color  COLOR,      uniform float reflectivity,     uniform sampler2D decalMap,     uniform samplerCUBE environmentMap  fetch reflected environment color float3 reflectedColor  texCUBEenvironmentMap,R  fetch the decal base coloe float3 decalColor  tex2DdecalMap,texCoord color.xyz  lerpreflectedColor,decalColor,reflectivitychange  color.w  1  codepre  pI set the uniform parameter reflectivity as 0.6.And the result is  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3lQu9.jpg altenter image description herep  pAs we can see,strongthe color information from the decal texture is loststrong.There is only color information from environment cube texture.And if I set reflectivity as 0,the model will be dark. But if I change the color.xyz in the fragment cg code as p  precodecolor.xyz  decalColor codepre  pI can get the right resultonly has color from decal texture  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSU3xI.jpg

Negative 137 pIve got a CI instance which connects to a Db and checks permissions before serving pages. If the page isnt accessible to the current user, it redirects to a login page.p  pThe login page, obviously, has permissions set so that its accessible to all users.p  pAfter a recent glitch, the database server came back up on a different IP address thank you Amazon, EC2.

My shape is complex, but to keep the code simple Ive replaced my shapes by rectangles I know that I could use the Rect object just to draw rectangles. p  pWhen you run this code you will see 8 rectangles widely separated both horizontally and vertically to be clear, what I want is each of the rectangles tightly butted up against each other. p  pIm using constants width and height both to draw the rectangles in function drawFunc, and to position the rectangles in the code codexPos  cols 1  widthcode so I would have thought that they would be tight against each other. p  pThe code is pretty simple. I loop through the rows and cols, I create a drawFunc for my shape, I use the widthheight in the drawing, and then I position the shape according to its rowcol using the same widthheight. So they should be tight against each other, not widely separated.p  pConfused.p  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltstylegt  body      margin 0px     padding 0px  ltstylegt ltscript srchttpwww.kineticjs.comdownloadkineticv3.9.8.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscriptgt     window.onload  drawKineticGrid       function drawKineticGrid           var width  80         var height  150          var stage  new Kinetic.Stage             container  container,             width  800,             height  600                   var layer  new Kinetic.Layer         var messageLayer  new Kinetic.Layer          for rows  1 rows lt 2 rows               for cols  1 cols lt 4 cols                  var aRect  new Kinetic.Shape                     name    rows    cols,                     drawFunc     function                           var context  this.getContext                         context.beginPath                           Make a simple shape  my actual shape is more complex, but Im                          writing a rectangle here to keep the code simple  I know I could use                           the KineticJS Rect class here instead.                          context.moveTothis.getX, this.getY                         context.lineTothis.getX  width, this.getY                          context.lineTothis.getX  width, this.getY  height                          context.lineTothis.getX, this.getY  height                          context.lineTothis.getX, this.getY                          context.lineWidth  2                         context.stroke                          this.fill                         this.stroke                           Draw the X and Y, Row and Col values in the rectangle                         context.fillTextx,y    this.getX  ,   this.getY, this.getX  5, this.getY  15                          context.fillTextrow, col    this.getName, this.getX  5, this.getY  30                      ,                     fill  ffffff,                     stroke  green,                     strokeWidth  1                                   add the  shape to the layer                 var xPos  cols  1  width                 var yPos  rows  1  height                  aRect.setXxPos                 aRect.setYyPos                 layer.addaRect                                 Add the layer to the stage         stage.addlayer         stage.addmessageLayer        ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv idcontainergtltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

One of the things this solution does is work with a SQL Server table that  yep, you guessed it  is also named PIA.  So everything about my project  including the main namespace  is F.PIA.p  pIm using F.A.PIA, to access the PIA table this assembly includes a Table and a public partial class PIA.p  pIn my solution, I can distinguish the two, but I find references to F.A.PIA to be clumsy the actual names are significantly longer than that example.p  pSo I tried to Refactor, wo success.  Im pretty sure the renaming changes something in the DataSetDesigner, or doesnt change something there or a related item  but Im not nearly proficient enough to figure out what, exactly, goes wrong  nor how to fix it.

So when I am running it on dev. server, everything is fine, but on IIS the page loading is incredible slow.br  So first question is how can be compiled application slower then application in debug mode   I wanted to find out why, so I started to remove javascript includes from my site.master.cs file.

But after removing whole text in the script, nothing changes.p  pSo  finally the situation is this when there is include for codeformsv2.jscode even if its empty file, my app is very slow, but when this include is removed, everything works fine.p  pP.S. I know that to improve performance its better to have les js files and I will merge it and minify before deploying, so thats not my problemp

HttpContext.Current.Session in PageLoad of the inner page does not have the values I just stuffed into it from the outer page.p  pI used to think it would be specific to the machine per whatevers in the users cookie.

Negative 137 pWhat would be considered best practice when working with the following scenariop  pI have a dataset of 6 million records total, broken down into 30 tables with some tables having a few hundred thousand records.  I need to use an api that only allows an insert of 200 records at a time.p  pI am breaking down the insert by table. Now here is where I am considering the first two options that came to my mind.  I can either get the full dataset for that table and then in C loop through the dataset only inserting 200 at a time.  Or I can make multiple database calls grabbing 200 records at a time. Creating my object and making the call to the API to insert my records. Which I think I could make the next database call while the other records are being inserted.p

As this API is loaded async and calls a function once is loaded, I used a requireJS plugin called async, that worked before with google maps api.p  pHowever, this time something isnt working. My module starts this way codedefine[textfmwkwidgetsvideovideo.html,fmwkutilsbrowser,asynchttpwww.youtube.comiframeapi], function videoTpl,root  ... codep  pand chrome console fires this error codeUncaught Error Load timeout for modules asynchttpwww.youtube.comiframeapiunnormalized3,asynchttpwww.youtube.comiframeapi httprequirejs.orgdocserrors.htmltimeoutcodep  pIf I dont use async plugin the object YT or its functions are undefinded, and the same happens if I download the API code. The API is loaded sometimes if I put an script tag in the head tag of the html file. All this is expected, but I dont understand because async plugin fails.p  pThank you for your attention and help p

Then, each time using a fresh EntityManager, I fetch emtwoem detached instances of the MainEntity with the contents of subs loaded, modify the contents field of both of them, then separately merge them back.p  pWhat I expect to see is the first merge go through OK and the second to throw an exception.p  pWhat actually happens is that both merges go through OK so the backing store has the second version of the contents field, but the version field is still 1 on the SubEntity but 3 on the MainEntity.  I dont understand why the main is getting its version number updated, why it isnt throwing an exception itself since the MainEntity is getting updated with an incorrect version number, why the sub entity isnt causing a locking exception, and more generally what is going on.p  pSo, have I misunderstood something or does there seem to be a bugp  pMany thanks for any comments.p  pJonathan.p  pHere is the business bit of the main code very slightly cleaned upp  precodeprivate static final EntityManagerFactory emf      Persistence.createEntityManagerFactorygeneraluse  private void doGPrintWriter out       First make sure db is empty     resetDbout       Create default contents     initDbout, 1       Get the main entity, detached     MainEntity m1  fetchout       Get another version     MainEntity m2  fetchout       Modify both versions of the sub entity in the detached copies     m1.subs.get0.incContent2     m2.subs.get0.incContent3       Merge them back into db     mergeout, m1       See whats in the db     fetchout       Merging the second one should cause an OptimisticLockException     try          mergeout, m2         out.formatWe should have gotten an exception here.      catch Throwable th          out.formatWe got an exception here s, s, th, th.getCause            Look at db     fetchout      This gets the MainEntity from the db by its key private MainEntity fetchPrintWriter out      EntityManager em  emf.createEntityManager     em.getTransaction.begin     MainEntity m  em.findMainEntity.class, MainEntity.singletonKey     m.toString     Make sure that nothing is lazily fetched.

Negative 137 pIm new at signal handling in Unix through C and I have been looking at some tutorials on it out of pure interest.p  pMy questions is, is it possible to continue execution of a program past the point where a signal is handledp  pI understand that the signal handling function does the cleanup but in the spirit of exception handling such as in C, is it possible for that signal to be handled in the same fashion and for the program to continue running normallyp  pAt the moment codecatchcode goes in an infinite loop presumably a way to quit would be to call codeexit1code . p  pMy intention would be for codebcode to be assigned 1 and for the program to finish gracefully if that is possible of course.p  pHeres my codep  precodeinclude ltsignal.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  int a  5 int b  0  void catchint sig      printfCaught the signal, will handle it nown     b  1   int mainvoid      signalSIGFPE, catch      int c  a  b      return 0  codepre  pAlso, as C is procedural, how come the signal handler declared before the offending statement is actually called after the latter has executedp  pAnd finally, in order for the handling function to do its clean up properly, all the variables than need to be cleaned up in the event of an exception need to be declared prior to the function, rightp  pThanks in advance for your answers and apologies if some of the above is very obvious.p

How can I fix this It seems like I can only change the Shadow and ShadowOffset using the UITextAttributeShadow, so I dont know how to make it look centered.p  pAny help is appreciatedp

Negative 137 pIm working on a iOS app where the user is fetching a reasonably sized database online, and then working with it offline. The update, and sync is taking around 1015 minutes due to the memory constraints on the device and the way Im handling the transactional inserts. All the while I have a dialog view open notifying the user of the progress, and give him the option of cancelling and reverting the changes to the database.p  pAnyway, today while testing I noticed that the iTunes app was trying to contact as server and do some background work, but threw an errorp  precode itunesstored[68] ltWarninggt Could not load download manifest with underlying error                               Error DomainNSURLErrorDomain Code1001 Cannot connect                              to 112.168.198.2 UserInfo0x1f8d6150                               NSLocalizedDescriptionCannot connect to 112.168.198.2 codepre  pThis caused a dialog to display on top of the one I was already displaying, notifying the user that iTunes was unable to connect. p  pNow when I clicked the close button, that somehow also closed my dialog, causing only parts of the actions, to be taken when the user decides to stop the update, to take place. The async update kept on going in the background, while the database tried to revert the changes causing the database to lock up and I needed to kill the process and restart the app and update. By design, that reverts everything if something terrible like this happens.p  pNow I noticed that I should make some changes in my code to make it harder for the database to lock up like that, and Im working on that.  But what I want to know is strongis it possible to forbid iTunes, or any other process for that matter, to do any work on the UI thread while a certain critical process in your app is taking placestrong p  pThe behavior of the iTunes dialog cancel button, i.e propagating down into my dialog cant be considered normal or reasonable. p

I want to make a programme with a list, which the user can add words to with one button, or clear the list completely with another.p  pSo far, Ive used traitsp  precodemyList  ListStr  myList  [Item1,Item2] Initial items in list codepre  pTo display this list in a traits UI, I used ListStrEditor from the traits UI package     ItemmyList, showlabel  False, label  Data Files, editor  ListStrEditorautoadd  Falsep  pI have coded 2 buttons one for ADDing an item to the list codemyList.appenditem3code and a CLEAR button to empty the list codemyList  []code. The basic UI is good, the buttons work and my list variable is changed as expected.p  pHowever, the problem is, that my list in the GUI doesnt update. If I click on it, the new values are displayed however. Also, I want to potentially add many items to it and wonder if there is a way to add a scrollbar to the sidep  pIve looked up the ListStrEditor manual and usage, although Im getting a bit bogged down with terminology. Apparently a emrefreshem function exists, but Im not sure how to apply it to ListStrEditor and also, Im not sure if I need to use things called adapters and handlers.p  pAny tips  pointers in the right direction would be much appreciated p

Unfortunately, I think the sample code invokes undefined behavior.  The proposal says of codelatchlatchcodep  blockquote   pDestroys the latch. If the latch is destroyed while other threads are in codewaitcode, or are invoking codecountdowncode, the behaviour is undefined.p blockquote  pNote that it says in codewaitcode and not blocked in codewaitcode, as the description of codecountdowncode uses.p  pThen the following sample is providedp  blockquote   pAn example of the second use case is shown below. We need to load data and then process it using a number of threads. Loading the data is IO bound, whereas starting threads and creating data structures is CPU bound.

Threads can now start processing     startlatch.countdown  codepre blockquote  pIsnt there a race condition between the threads waking and returning from codewaitcode, and destruction of the latch when it leaves scope  Besides that, all the codethreadcode objects are leaked.  If the scheduler doesnt run all worker threads before codecountdowncode returns and the codestartlatchcode object leaves scope, then I think undefined behavior will result.  Presumably the fix is to iterate the vector and codejoincode and codedeletecode all the worker threads after codecountdowncode but before returning.p  ol liIs there a problem with the sample codeli liDo you agree that a proposal should show a complete correct example, even if the task is extremely simple, in order for reviewers to see what the use experience will be likeli ol  hr  pNote It appears possible that one or more of the worker threads havent yet begun to wait, and will therefore call codewaitcode on a destroyed latch.p  hr  pUpdate Theres now a new version of the proposal, but the representative example is unchanged.p

Ive been reading the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsphonedevelopjj20697428vvs.10529.aspx relnofollowMultiresolution guidea on MSDN for guidance on doing this, but its not entirely clear to me yet.p  ul lipIt recommends providing only WXGA assets. Is there any value in providing images for each resolution ex. logo.screenwvga.png, wxga.png, 720p.png Its fairly easy for me to generate each resolution, and Im not concerned by increasing the package size. I wonder if assets are expected to have a higher quality sometimes if the OS doesnt scale them down. This isnt for a background image that needs to fill the screen area  its for a logo and smallmedium icons used throughout the app.pli lipLets say I only make a WXGA version of an icon. Whats the proper way to describe the image in XAML If my original image for WVGA screens on WP7 was 37px by 36px, I generated WXGA one by multiplying dimensions by 1.6 my image is now 59px by 58px rounded. If I have codeltImage SourceMyWxgaIcon.pnggtcode and run it on the WXGA emulator, the OS blows it up by another 1.6x factor. It seems like I need to specify the dimensions of the original, prescaling image like this codeltImage SoruceMyWxgaIcon.png Width37 Height36gtcode. This seems unnatural as the asset doesnt have those dimensions  is this the expected waypli ul  pThanks.p

Negative 137 pI know that JPanel is, by default, automatically doublebuffered.

Negative 137 pI am currently developing an AJAX application using PHP and Javascript that allows people to upload images that will be printed on foil. Since I will be using a standard CMYK printer, it wont print any white parts, but rather just leave those spots blank  a thing that usually does not make a difference on white paper, but here it does, since Im printing on foil. It gets more complicated when you consider that a grey dot will become semitransparent black, and Im not even talking of colors yet.p  pYet I would like to create a PNG file with an alpha channel that will simulate the printing process, so I can give a preview of how the printed foil would look when being hold against different backgrounds.p  pNow I do understand the basic theory of subtractive and additive color models and also of RGBA and CMYK, but then again its only the basics and here Im kind of at a loss of how to proceed. I guess in theory you would convert every pixel into CMYK and interpret each channel as a scale from transparent to color instead of from white to color, but how would you translate that back into RGBAp  pThe nicest thing would, of course, be if ImageMagick would provide such a feature .... does it, or do I have to loop through the pixels manually If the latter, how would I do the calculationsp  pI dont know if this has been an issue before. I couldnt find anything on either Stackoverflow or Google, but maybe I just missed the right keywords. Any further reading, food for thoughts or hyperlinks with a note we discussed this a million times, idiot would be warmly welcome.p  pThanksp

Negative 137 pLong story short Im working on refactoring an old Android project of mine. Previously, it was using serialization, which was painfully slow and, from what Im reading, a pretty lousy idea in general for Android apps. Im looking for another way to persist both userspecific data as well and readonly data for the application.p  pThere is going to be a good deal of data on both sides and Im not sure if theres a good way to store it. Basically, the app is a small RPG. There are a number of maps that are represented as 2D arrays of Tiles. Each Tile will have a number of attributes, some simple primitives or enums, others additional objects, such as Events, which will also potentially contain various objects, etc. With 400 Tiles in a 20x20 map alone, theres a LOT of data to store. In addition to storing that data, it would need to store a lot of userspecific data, such as which Tiles have been visited, which Events have been successfully run, etc.p  pIve been examining methods of saving this data out and I just cant seem to settle on something. I guess it boils down to XML or JSON vs SQLite. XML or JSON would be more flexible in terms of future changes, which is good as I want flexibility in the data, ie, adding new attributes to existing objects, adding new objects as the need arises, etc. SQLite isnt as easily malleable as you have to change up the schema, perhaps adjust queries and indexes, etc, but I havent really used SQLite in the past, so maybe there are some features that help to simplify that process. However, I would also like fast random access to data to avoid loading everything into memory at once if it can be helped. For example, when moving from one map to another, Id much rather load the next map only when needed rather than having everything held in memory, which is where SQLite would shine as Id be able to directly query the data rather than traversing a JSONXML file to find potentially scattered data, ie, we load the map, but Events and objects contained in the Events may not be unique to that map and could easily lie elsewhere in the file or in another file entirely. However, normalizing the data in SQLite would mean a lot of tables and quite a bit of deconstructingreconstructing of objects.p  pWriting user data would only occur when the user manually saves the game, so write performance is not a big issue.p  pI sometimes have a tendency to overanalyze and get hung up on stuff like this. Maybe neither case is necessarily wrong and Im worrying about things that are infinitesimal. Maybe there are other cases that I havent considered. Ive used Hibernate and have considered something like ORMLite to handle a lot of the database nittygritty, but that would require a lot of retrofitting, likely much more than what I would need to do for other options.p

Negative 137 pThe question is in the context of Grails GORM programming, but it would be interesting to know the situation with this in other Hibernate uses, if there are indeed any real differences.p  pWhen one tries to save an object which was not selected with locking, one can get a StaleObjectStateException, if the database object was simultaneously updated by another threadapplication. Hibernate docs say that after such an exception the whole session is unusable, because this exception may somehow mess up the session state. It seems that every object which was opened in this session also becomes unusable, even if such object was in fact not even modified by another thread. It seems that one cannot even .refreshmodify.save the object in the same session either, even though logically that should work.p  pSo what is the deal with the session breaking and is there a preferred way to deal with it Reselecting the object itself is not a problem, but the fact that every other object selected in that session becomes unusable is very problematic. I have a complicated method which loads a lot of these objects and keeps them in memory in different places, how do I go about handling this after an exception strongI dont want to just rollback everything the method has done when one of the objects gets this exception, the logic is smart enough to just handle it, if there was a way to keep the sessionobjects operational.strong Does one really have to go through every single object in memory and somehow refresh it just because one of them was updated by another thread p  pIs a StatelessSession something to considerp  pAlso maybe I am missing something here There is a plethora of quesions about StaleObjectStateException, and almost none of them even list this as a concern Isnt the fact that any object selected in the same session can randomly become unusable if just a single one of them was updated in the background a big goddamn inconveniencep

Negative 137 pI have been using PLINQ recently to perform some data handling.p  pBasically I have about 4000 time series so basically instances of codeDictionaryltDataTime,Tgtcode which I stock in a list called codetimeSeriescode.p  pTo perform my operation, I simply dop  precodetimeSeries.AsParallel.ForAllxgtmyOperationx codepre  pIf I have a look at what is happening with my different cores, I notice that first, all my CPUs are being used and I see on the console where I output some logs that several time series are processed at the same time.p  pHowever, the process is lengthy, and after about 45 minutes, the logging clearly indicates that there is only one thread working. Why is thatp  pI tried to give it some thought, and I realized that codetimeSeriescode contains instances simpler to process from codemyOperationcodes point of view at the beginning and the end of the list. So, I wondered if maybe the algorithm that PLINQ was using consisted in splitting the 4000 instances on, say, 4 cores, giving each of them 1000. Then, when the core is finished with its allocation of work, it goes back to idle. This would mean that one of the core may be facing a much heavier workload.p  pIs my theory correct or is there another possible explanationp  pShall I shuffle my list before running it or is there some kind of parallelism parameters I can use to fix that problemp

Negative 137 pIm using codepdataTablecode from Primefaces 3.5 with lazy loading and dynamic columns.p  pI have three types of columns, the difference is in input for filtering.

I also have codeptabViewcode, where each tab includes this dataTable and with every request, all beans are initialized.

Negative 137 pWhen Im using MovieCliproot.gotoAndStop to navigate to another frame. The audio in the movieclips from the frames between will start playing. The audio is set to STREAM in all movieclips and there is no additional code to start the movieclips.

Negative 137 pHow do I write a cron for verified act emails amp lost passwords timerp  pIm using apache on Linux server with mysql database and php code. In the database, besides the  usual fields for an account, I have verified a boolean that is 1 for yes and 0 for no, actkey varchar50 for sending an email to users with link to special pages for verifying their email  or if they forgot their password, timedatetime and tempboolean that is 1 for forgot password or 0 for not.p  pWhen a user creates an account, I set the verified in the new act to 0, timecurrent date amp  time, temp0 and generate actkey that I send in email to them.  If they try to login and there act is not verified then they cant get in. If they click the link and go to a certain page within an hour I set verified to one and they can login.  If they clink on the link after the one hour then I tell them that the key is invalid and there account was deleted and to make a new one.p  pIf a user forgets their password, they go to this page where they enter their email and if the  email matches a record in the database I set temp1 and timecurrent date amp time. I tell user  that I sent out email regardless. If they clink this new link it goes to a page and if its less then an hour I make them reset there password and temp is set back to zero.  If they click on the link after the hour, I tell them the key is invalid. After one hour temp is set back to zero.p  pThe verification process was working fine until I added the time variable into the equation. I  never really got the forgot password part working.p  pI know I need to setup a cron job to do two things every hourp  ol lidelete accounts were verified0 and its been more than an hour since created that act.li liupdate accounts where temp1 and its been more than an hour since sent out forgot password emailli ol  pMy main questions arep  ol lipAm I using the correct datatype in my database for the time field And if not which should I usepli lipHow do I set the time variablestrongtime  getdatestrong maybe, the default is null time is the variable im using to insert into dB record for time field. pli lipHow do I make the cron script Im using godaddy, do I just point the cron control to this php file and if so is this the code I needp  precodeconnect to cron  webcgibinphp5 f HOMEhtmlhourly.php  connect to dB  include dbconnect.php   delete any unverified email act records that are more than 1 hour old  DELETE from members WHERE verified  0 amp time  1 gt NOW  make temp0 on any record where temp is 1 for more than an hour  UPDATE members SET temp0 WHERE temp  1 amp time  1 gt NOW  mysqliclosemysqli codepreli lipDoes any of my overall method sound fundamentally flawedpli ol  pPlease thank you in advance.p

Negative 137 pIve just realized that when you observe the codemovedTocode event on some codecursorcode, the event is only triggered for documents that actually changed their strongrelativestrong position in the resulting set, so not only its index. For example, if the resulting set of documents is first equal to code[1, 2, 3]code, and then it changes to code[3, 1, 2]code, the event will be triggered only for the third document, not all of them. While it sound reasonable from the efficiency point of view, the documentation is not at all clear look a hrefhttpdocs.meteor.comobserve relnofollowhereap  blockquote   pstrongmovedTodocument, fromIndex, toIndex, beforestrongp      pA document changed its position in the result set, from codefromIndexcode to codetoIndexcode   which is before the document with id codebeforecode.

Negative 137 pI  have configured the workgroup manager on Mac OS X Server 10.5.8 with 5 network users in 2 groups. Now I notice that when a network user makes a new folder, the folder is created with read amp write permissions for that user, but the group to which the user belongs as well as everyone has only read permissions and other network users are not able to add files or change things in the folder.p  pI found something about changing the umask by adding a launchdusers.conf file configuring the umask default setting. I did that on the server but that doesnt change anything.p  pIts a very annoying issue and I hope its easy to fix. Im not an expert, so Im not sure if you know enough with the details above.

Negative 137 pIm trying to read the contents of a list view using automation. The first time I navigate to it, Im able to go from item to item, getting the correct text for each list item. However, when I display a different screen which is apparently reusing this display object, the text on the screen is different, but automation gets the same text as the first set. From then on I can only get the text for the first view I looked at. Its like the text is being cached and Im only able to look at the cached view. UISpy, however, seems to grab the right values every time, and if I use it while my automation is paused, I end up getting the right values.p  pIn my automation, I use Find to grab the header, and walk the tree to the List View and get the text for each element.

Negative 137 pIm creating a code to delete some video files that I dont need.  The videos are from CCTV footage and  they record 247.

Negative 137 pI was trying to solve the Game of life problem for a teacher. Rules of that game arep  pAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.

Negative 137 pI have an Excel program using VBA to find the total costs for material, labor, and everything else from the configuration of a certain product. At this point in the project, I need to look up the price of a certain part of the configuration and the only way to do that is through regex. I have a list in one sheet, called Test Plan, that contains the actual strings and a list in another sheet, called bomtrafocost.csv, which contains all of the expressions. There will be an unknown amount of rows in column B of the Test Plan, but there will always be 204 rows in bomtrafocost rows 4 to 207. I need to compare each string in Test Plan to every expression in bomtrafocost. I attempted to attach a picture, but, unfortunately, I do not have enough reputation. Here is my code to test the stringsp  precodeFunction TestMLFBsMLFB, sPattern As Boolean Set re  New RegExp re.Pattern   amp ReplacesPattern, , ... amp  re.IgnoreCase  False TestMLFB  re.TestsMLFB End Function Function TestOptionCodesCode, sPattern As Boolean Set re  New RegExp bInvert  False If LeftsPattern, 1   Then     sPattern  RightsPattern, LensPattern  1     bInvert  True End If re.Pattern  . amp sPattern amp . If bInvert Then TestOptionCode  Not re.TestsCode Else TestOptionCode  re.TestsCode End Function codepre  pWhat I need to know is how to test each of the strings one at a time to every regular expression. Once it is returned True for a match, I need to know which row in the bomtrafocost sheet matched as to find the corresponding prices. I hope this makes sense. Thanks for the help.p

Negative 137 pIn my asp.net application, at first time launching the application, if there is no database connections provided, it will redirect to separate page asks for entering the database  details, if they provide valid details, we have to create the new database and need to use that connection string through out the application.p  pHere what my scenario is, after creating the database i stored the connection string in web.config file programmatically, but when i trying to reuse the connection string it showing the empty string.p  pI come to know that web.config file only gives the values what we provide at compile time. To overcome this situation i go for XML files to store connection string  which is not secured to store the secured and sensitive information. Because my application should have the capability to change the connection string from front end.p  pMy questions arep  ol liIs there any way to store the connection string securely,and that to have to change dynamically if change from the application.li liI can access my XML file though browser, and can view all connection details, how can i restrict to access the XML file from the URL.li ol  pand any other better solution is appreciated.p

Negative 137 pThis is a problem Ive been trying to fix for 3 hours now. How the app works Ive got a list of numbers in a txt file in assets.

Since the key is present and refresh period is over, the stale value should be returned and async refresh should be kicked offli lipThread.sleep2000Lpli lipMake another call for the same key. pli ul  pSince I am mocking the dao, I expect it to be called atleast twice. However, when I am trying to verify the mock, it fails saying that mock was just called once.

Negative 137 pI have got a question about unary operator overloading.

I know for codep  pcodef3f1f2code is equal to codef3f1.operatorf2code, that is the object in front of the operator will call the operator and the one behind will be passed as parameter, rightp  pThen, for unary operator codecode, the code is p  pcodef3f1code p  pfollowing the thought above for operator codecode, I think the code should be like codef3f1code, which is equal to codef3f1.operatorcode. Why the actual code is codef3f1code instead of codef3f1code I think the object in front of the operator should call it... I know in math, it is codef3f1code, but how can the compiler recognize the code codef3f1code which actually is that codef1code calls the operator how does it know that in this case, codecode is an unary operatorp  pThanks so muchp

Negative 137 pCurrently we have a website running on a Centos 6.5 webserver with Direct Admin. APC was configured in the past and is working nicely, but some reading suggested to also implement memcached to cache some static tables like for instance menus.p  pAs of MySQL 5.6, the innoDB tables are compatible with a mysql memcache deamon, so I started off following this guide a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.6eninnodbmemcachedinstalling.html relnofollowhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.6eninnodbmemcachedinstalling.htmla. The config script is ran and the deamon is installed. p  pHowever the a hrefhttpswww.drupal.orgprojectmemcache relnofollowDrupal memcache plugina does not see memcache is running. That module is obviously checking for the php memcached deamon, while my deamon is already running in mysql. p  pSince both extensions are called codememcached.socode, we strongly have the feeling this is the same thing. Are there actually two different things and does Drupal not support the InnoDB memcached deamon, do I need both php extension to access the mysql extension, or was this supposed to be working and did we something wrongp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThe status report showed something like not running, but one of my colleagues has installed the PHP PECL extension now and it seems to be working. But then I still dont understand what the MySQL innodb deamon plugin does. Is it not needed, or does it improve database access even more then the PHP extension wouldp

Negative 137 pEarlier today the TFS server where I work went down.

However, when I try to go online with the solution I get the error message stating Unable to determine the workspace for this solution. So I went ahead and verified that the workspace is correct with all the bindings from the associated source control folder to that of my local folders. So to try and fix the issue I did the following stepsp  ol liI completely disassociated the solution from source control even though its offline.li liRebinded the solution to source control. At this point all locks were visible on the solution and the files that were checked out.li liI got the latest version for the project and and updated my local solution.li ol  pRebinding the solution worked to fix my initial issue. However, every time I exit visual studio 2013 and go back into the solution it loses all the bindings and its unable to determine the workspace for the solution. Has anyone ran into this before Is there something that I am overlooking Any help will be greatly appreciated.p  pPlease Note, I have read though some of the posts already on stackoverflow and I have not found one that addresses the issue with Visual Studio losing the bindings on each startup.p

Negative 137 pIm currently working through The Little Schemer.

Then Ill recur through this list and check that every evaluated function matches its expected output. If any one of them does not match, the entire thing should return false.p  pThis will be easier demonstrated with a code examplep  precodedefine testfns listoftests    takes a list of pairs functions and expected outputs and returns true only    if all outputs match expected   define testfn test     let       [fn car test]        [expected car cdr test]       equal eval fn expected      cond     null listoftests t     else       and testfn car listoftests testfns cdr listoftests  let   [lat ice cream with fudge for dessert]    [lat2 coffee cup tea cup and hick cup]   testfns      multisubst brown cup lat2 coffee brown tea brown and hick brown     multiinsertL brown cup lat2 coffee brown cup tea brown cup and hick brown cup     multiinsertR brown cup lat2 coffee cup brown tea cup brown and hick cup brown     multirember cup lat2 coffee tea and hick     subst topping fudge lat ice cream with topping for dessert codepre  pHowever, this gives me an error codemultisubst unbound identifiercodep  pI used DrRacket to step through the execution and realised that I am passing the symbol codemultisubst brown cup lat2code and of course codelat2code is not defined inside codetestfnscode.p  pSo what I want to do in the second code block is somehow expand each local variable e.g. codelatcode and codelat2code into its component parts inside the list passed to testfns.p  pSo we would end up with codemultisubst brown cup coffee cup tea cup and hick cupcode instead for the car of the first pair.p  pI have a vague notion that this might be what macros are for but Im not sure.

Negative 137 pSo Im thinking of using MongoDB for a project.

I like that it resembles my json in my app so I can easily bind to it using libraries like Angular. I use Node.js. Im digging this whole MEAN mongodb, express, angular, node stack concept.p  pWhat I dont like though are these relational issues, it seems that it doesnt deal too well with real world data. Think a relational app schoolstudentsteachers with all sorts of relationships in them.p  pThat said, I dont like sql. I think its outdated especially for jsonjavascript based webapps and I dont like to define types, I dont like that its hard to dynamically add fields to a table and I dont like to manually do joins. p  pSo my question is.. is there something in the middle Somewhere in the middle between a mysql database and a mongodb database Maybe a normalized json store that handles the relationships for me. Or a mongolike db that is really fast with references as opposed to putting everything in the same document.p  pp.s I know there are such things as MySQL ORMs. but I want the actual database to store json, kind of like mongodb does, but just to be able to handle relational data as well.p

Negative 137 pIve notoced lots of websites allow users to register by simply asking their email and password [aside all the other information like name, username, genre etc.]. And the users dont have to do email verification as they register, they simply have a reminder that they should verify their email, but otherwise they can use the website normally. This is very good for UX, since the user can immediately start using a website and not wasting time to do email verifications etc. before he knows whether he will keep using this website or not.br So the question I wanted to ask is the followingbr Suppose a malicious user writes a program that will keep registering users with valid usernames and validsyntactically emails.br This will eventually cause lost of trouble if not correctly managedp  ul  lithe database will eventually run out of ids for usersli liThis will create lots of records, thus eating up spaceli liMore user records, means more lookup timeli ul  pSo, Im really curious how all this is managed, if at all.br NOTE most of websites Im talking about, do not use CAPTCHAbad for UX, so they manage the issue in some other way, again, if at all.brbut neither the solution is to delete the record if the user hasnt confirmed hisher email in a time term. For suppose user looses Internet connection[, or forgets, or anything else] the last day he has to verify email. So the user will loose hisher account and just forget about that website. So this is not a solution.br not sure about IP limitations. But suppose that is an Internet cafe and users keep registering. And there are dynamic IPs these days. Is limiting the registration to some amount of time a solution But how do I know when the last registration occurred if the IP keeps changing. So how is this issue solvedp

Negative 137 pUpdated  Im dealing with a scenario here in the company about high availability. Im not that knowledgeable in server and stuffs but, our adviser said that we also need to see if a lotus notes application is capable or prepared for high availability. All I know about high availability is that it is a server setup to prevent interruption of tasks performed by users who uses the servers, so when Server A is down Server B will handle the load. So its really unclear to me why we need to check if a lotus notes app is ready for high availability since setting up servers are the main concerns there. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 137 pI have created a single jar for Java 7 amp 8 for a JDBC driver using sourcetarget compile options. However, I am having difficulty compiling applications that use the newoverloaded methods in the codeResultSetcode interfacep  blockquote   pNew in Java 8p      pstrongupdateObjectint columnIndex, Object x, SQLType targetSqlTypestrongp      p Available in Java 7p      pstrongupdateObjectint columnIndex, Object x, int targetSqlTypestrongp blockquote  pNote that SQLType is a new interface introduced in Java 8.p  pI have compiled the driver using Java 8, which worked fine. However, when any application using the driver accesses the method codeupdateObjectint, Object, intcode from Java 7, it gets a compilation error saying class file for java.sql.SQLType not found, although the application is not using codeSQLTypecode. I think this is because Java looks at all the overloaded methods to determine the most specific one, and when doing so it can not access the new codeupdateObjectcode method in Java 8 as codeSQLTypecode is not defined in Java 7. Any idea how I can resolve this issuep  pNote that the codeupdateObjectcode method has a strongdefaultstrong implementation in the codeResultSetcode interface in Java 8  so I can not even use a more generic type instead of SQLType in the new method. In that case any application that uses the new method gets a compilation error saying codeupdateObjectcode is ambiguous. p

Negative 137 pWhat Im trying to do is, if I type red into a cell, then the cells backcolor changes to red and if I type blue into a cell, then the cells backcolor changes to blue. The problem Im getting is, if I type blue, only blu is recorded as mystring, as the textchanged event records the cell value before the change, so the cells backcolor never changes color as a result.

Negative 137 pfirst time here. Im trying to create my custom tumblr theme with 3 columns using Masonry plugin but im not going so well.

The below MSDN quote states the necessary of independent culture settings.p  blockquote   pStoring data in a cultureindependent format guarantees a known format   that does not change. When users from different cultures access the   data, it can be formatted appropriately based on specific user. For   example, if your application stores DateTime types in a text file,   formatted for the invariant culture, the application should use the   InvariantCulture property when calling ToString to store the strings   and the Parse method to retrieve the strings. This technique ensures   that the underlying values of the DateTime types do not change when   the data is read or written by users from different cultures.p blockquote

However, now in development a got a javascript error. Because angularytics.js needs the ga object created in the angularyticsyanpy.js. As this script is not created because is in development environment a get the javascript error. codepre  pI also added the codeltscript srclibpluginsangularytics.jsgtltscriptgtcode dinamically. But I got a new error, because this script defines a angularytics provider that is defined in the app.js file. p  pSo, the errors are chained and thats why I tried to update the angularytics.js script in order to keep the provider but in case of environment different that production it should do nothing.p  pProbably Im not so clear, but its not easy to explain. Just let me know if you need some more clarifications.p

Negative 137 pAlright, heres what Im dealing with you can skip to TLDR if all you need to see is what I want to runp  pIm having an issue with file formatting for a nasty conglomeration of several ancient programs Ive strung together. I have some data in code.CSVcode format, and I need to put it into code.SPCcode format. Ive tried a set of proprietary MATLAB programs called GS tools for fast and easy conversion, but fast and easy doesnt look like its gonna happen here since there are discrepancies in how code.spccode files are organized now and how they were organized back when my ancient programs were written.  p  pIf I could find the source code for the old programs I could probably alter the GS tools code to write my code.spccode files appropriately, but all I can find are broken links circa 2002 and earlier.  Seeing as I dont know what my programs are looking for, I have no choice but to try resaving my data with other programs until one of them produces something workable.p  pI found my Cinderella program if I open the data I have in a program called codeSpekwincode and save the file with a code.spccode extension... viola  Everything else runs on those files.  The problem is that I have hundreds of these files and Id like to automate the conversion process.  p  pI either need to extract the writing rubric codeSpekwincode uses for code.spccode files I believe that info is stored in a codedllcode file within the program, but Im not sure if that actually makes sense and use it as a rule to write a file from my input data, or I need a piece of code that will open a file with codeSpekwincode, tell codeSpekwincode to save that file under the code.spccode extension, and terminate codeSpekwincode.p  pTLDR Need a command that tells the computer to open a file with a certain program, save that file under a different extension through that program essentially codeopen.csvgtsave asgt.spccode, then terminate the program.br ORI need a way to tell MATLAB to write a file according to rules specified by a code.dllcode, but Im not sure I fully understand what that entails.p  pOf course Im open to suggestions on other ways to handle this.p

Negative 137 pCurrently current x8664 AMD64 machines do not implement the full 64bit memory space in wiring. Thus, the available memory space is quite less in my own machine codecat proccpuinfocode says code36 bits physical, 48 bits virtualcode.p  pIf we asume, for the sake of the question, that we need not make our application portable for the full 64 bits of addressing.p  pThen, we have a lot of room in pointers that are effectively being wasted. Can the unusable space for addressing be used for the storage of further information, or to use the same data type with an indicator of whether it is a tagged pointer or something else maybe an immediate small value instead of a pointerp  pI think the most prominent usecase could be to implement runtimes, intepreters and compilers of dynamic languages, but Im sure it can be extended to more usage.p

Something happens when I segue to the DoubleMenuViewController to break the menus. The menus wont even load. However, if Im in a SingleMenuViewController that only calls SideBarNSObject then the code will work so long as Im only calling one menu.

This includes renaming the initializers that you saw in the NSObject SubClass and the target view controller.pli lipIve tried using control flow in the viewDidLoad method with a button tag. I took away the swipe features to show the menu and added buttons because I thought system was struggling to deal with the Swipes.pli lipIve tried deinitializing in the SideBar subclass file of NSObject. All that got me was an infinite loop that crashed the application after login.pli lipThen I tried ondemand initialization in the targetViewController.....DoubleMenuViewController and SingleMenuViewController. I returned to a working menu with buttons in the SingleMenuViewController but it still wont show the left and right menu in the DoubleMenuViewController.pli lipLast I tried deinitializing the SideBar left SideBar and the RightSideBar in the DoubleMenuViewController. However, when I add println functions to all my sections the debugger doesnt run the print function for me to get values of objects or even show typed states like strongThisstrong. I added the print functions because I wasnt sure if I would know when deinitialization and reinitialization occurred.pli ol  pIt seems that my menu is initialized from the SideBar NSObject file and the RightSideBarNSObject file. What I mean is that my menu is being created before I hit the target view controller. This isnt a problem for me so long as I can get the compiler to initialize the SideBar and the RightSideBar in the same View Controller, but it wont do that.p  pI just need to be able to control both menus with swipes or button taps.p  pI think I have a problem with my initializers overriding each other.p  pHowever, I dont know how to fix that problem. Ive read through the Swift manual and read articles on the internet. Ive also searched StackOverflow.p

Negative 137 pOk so I am very new to C and retrieved a piece of code to display rss software update information from a site to my windows program. I noticed that one of the nodes had the description I needed displayed as  so I changed the code a bit to try and gather this information however, when doing this I broke the dropdown box feature, tried to fix it myself but couldnt figure out what went wrong.p  pSo what happens is on the formload event it should load the rss page into my display box then if I select a different patch note from the dropdown box it should change based on what I selected. Right now it only changes the bottom text link and not the main window displaying the  information.p  pThis is the code itself.

Negative 137 pOk, basically Im using Nginx, Passenger, Rails and Angular. Ive created an Angular app that compiles to Rails public folder. Rails provides the API underneath the Angular app.p  pId like to have all traffic that comes codewww.mydomain.comadmincode to this codeadmin.htmlcode file located in the public directory. Ive got a route in Rails codeconfigroutes.rbcode pointing to codeadmin.htmlcode like sop  precodematch     adminall gt redirectadmin.html, via get codepre  pBut that doesnt seem to do the trick. I also would like Nginx to redirect all traffic with codeadmincode to this codeadmin.htmlcode file in public folder.p  pBy the way, the codeadmin.htmlcode is the Angular app.p  pstrongEDIT The Angular app is not being served by Railsstrongp  pAt the moment, theres no views in Rails at all. Rails is just an API underneath a standalone Angular app that happens to be in the public directory inside Rails app. Ive chosen this approach at this stage for two reasons One I might deploy the Angular on a separate server at later stage, but not right now. So keeping the Angular completely independent and separate is a good idea. Two, At the moment, keeping the Angular on top of the Rails app will help reduce latency. p  pThe whole setup is part of an experience that will evolve, I wanted to keep my options open moving forward.p

With IOS Safari scrolling is discontinued at the breakpoint and is only continued if I am interrupting the touch gesture and then resume it. p  pPlease checkout the demo If the background is partly green then the native scrolling is disabled and alternative events touchmove, mousewheel, wheel are detected to move the content.
