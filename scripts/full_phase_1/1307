Positive 1307 pMy datagrid has a depthdimensions column that shows fractions one dimension used for example is 24 38. I have the ability to choose the text fraction or decimal, but essentially I would need to be able to convert back and forth from strong24 38strong to strong24.375strong.p  pstrongWhy the Decimal format is neededstrong I have checkboxes to filter the depthdimensions column, so Ill need decimal form for that logic e.g. checkbox to see filter depthdimensions between 20 and 26. p  pstrongWhy the fraction format is neededstrong Ill need the fraction format because that depthdimension data will be referenced as a string in another part of the application.

Positive 1307 pI have a strongWPFstrong codeWindowcode with a codeDataGridcode inside a codeGridcode like thisp  precodeltWindow xClassWpfApplication1.MainWindow         xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation         xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml         TitleMainWindow SizeToContentWidthAndHeight WindowStyleToolWindow ResizeModeNoResizegt     ltGridgt         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt             ltColumnDefinition WidthAutogt         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt          ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltRowDefinition HeightAutogt             ltRowDefinition HeightAutogt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt          ltTextBlock FontSize20gtSome header with some pretty longish textltTextBlockgt          ltDataGrid Grid.Row1 Height200gt             ltDataGrid.Columnsgt                 ltDataGridTextColumn HeaderColumn1 Widthgt             ltDataGrid.Columnsgt         ltDataGridgt      ltGridgt ltWindowgt codepre  pId like the codeDataGridcodes width to be at least the width of the codeTextBlockcode, which in this case is, because of the codeGridcodes codeColumnDefinitioncodes width set to codeAutocode.p  pBut somehow, the width of the codeDataGridcodes codeColumncode is at a minimum and cant even be resized, while I expect its width to be filled. Currently it looks like thisbr a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com6LtEt.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6LtEt.png altenter image description hereap  pNote that the window has to be a codeToolWindowcode and its codeSizeToContentcode set to codeWidthAndHeightcode.p
Positive 1307 pI need to import a CSV file to datagrid on a button click using silverlight 4.0 and Cp
Positive 1307 pI have created a WPF application which uses many DataGrid controls on different tabs in the user interface.  I applied a date format to selected date columns with this codep  poColumn.Binding.StringFormat  MMddyyyyp  pI also set some columns as hidden with this codep  poColumn.Visibility  System.Windows.Visibility.Hiddenp  pThose both work perfectly on my machine running both in Visual Studio and from an exe.  However, I gave a copy of the exe to someone else in the company here running on a different machine.  The date columns are not formatted correctly and the hidden columns are visible on her machine.  Also some of her columns dont sort when she clicks their header, but they sort correctly on my machine.p  pWe tried to solve this by creating a setup project and including .NET 4.5 in the setup.  She ran the setup and the problems continued unchanged.  We tried setting compatibility mode to Windows 7 on her machine and the problems continued unchanged.  Can anyone suggest how we correct this in production so that the user will see the DataGrid columns correctly formatted and sortingp
Positive 1307 pI needed to invert ColumnsRows on my DataGrid see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4132829wpfhorizontaldatagridWPF horizontal DataGrida and a hrefhttpsrotatedwpfdatagrid.codeplex.com relnofollowRotatedDataGridap  pOnce I inverted it, I am having some weird effects on the images displayed inside my datagrid.p  pWhen I scroll down, the column 1 will crop the image by the left and a little on the right. The more I go down, the more it crops the left until there is nothing more.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comQ3cwG.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQ3cwG.png altenter image description hereap

Positive 1307 pI have a Datagrid that I am attempting to display the value in a combo box. The comboboxs values are dynamic and are several lists concatenated together. I am having trouble getting the Node Name column to display its initial value after I Deserialize the XML and set the data context. p  pAll other columns and bound data works. The only one I am having trouble with is the Node Name column. p  pThe values in the combo appear when I drop it down, I am able to select a value, and the value displays after the selection and the combobox has lost focus. This is only the initial deserialization and displaying of the value that I am having trouble with. It is also worth noting that strongSelectedTeststrong changes when a column in another datagrid is selected, Updating the currently selected test and changing the data in this datagrid. This works, all other data populates except the Node Name column. p  pI have also verified that the object is deserialized properly and the data is present in the object.p  pXAMLp  precodeltDataGrid

Is there anyway to possibly do this You would think there would be a way I could just be like p  pcodeif myDataGridObj.cellselected[i] is in this Columncodep  precode    do stuff  codepre  pI basically want to give back the content of that specific cell when a user double clicks on that specific cell. I dont wwant anything to pop up though unless that specific cell falls under a certain column name and is clicked. I  only want to give back that cells content.p
Positive 1307 pI have 3 columns . One with check box , One with text  column and one column with drop down.p  pI am binding the entire table itemsource to StepTaskViewInfo.CurrentStep.ProjectTasks.Items . StepTaskViewInfo is a variable in my VM and others are nested in it. This works fine .p  pOnly thing that doesnt work is the IsReadOnly property of the FIRST Columns. Am assuming this is some issue because my items source is different and the read only property is different in terms of level of nesting from view model.p  precodeFor grid  Items Source  StepTaskViewInfo gt CurrentStep gt ProjectTasks gtItems   For read only propety of each columnwhich doesnt work   IsReadOnlyBinding StepTaskViewInfo.AreStepsTasksReadonly   StepTaskViewInfo  gt

These do not follow a similar pattern, so one regex in an .htaccess wont cut it.

Negative 1307 pHey guys, I would like to develop a lightlaser show editor and simulator, and for this of course I am going to learn some graphics programming. I am thinking about using C and XNA.p  pI was just wondering what aspects of graphics programming I should research or focus on given the project I am working on. I am new to graphics programming so I dont know much about it, but for example I imagine something that I might look into would empossiblyem be volumetric lighting.p  pFor example, what would be a practical way to go about rendering a laser of varied widthcolor I read somewhere to just draw a cylinder and apply a shader to it, I would like to confirm that this is the way.p  pGiven that this seems like a big project, I was thinking about starting off by creating light sources and giving them properties so that I can easily manipulate them. I have misread that only a certain amount of lights can be rendered at any given time, I believe eight. Does this only apply to ambient lights Given this possible limitation, and the fact that most of the lights I will use will be directional, such as headlights or lasers, what would be a different way to render these Is that what volumetric lighting would bep  pId just like to get some things clear before I dive into it. Since Im new to this I probably didnt make the best use of words, so if something doesnt make sense please let me know. Thanks and sorry for my ignorance.p

Negative 1307 pI am trying to convert compressed swf files to uncompressed swf files using the cws2fws utility written by Alex Beregszaszi and which is part of the ffmpeg set of conversion routines.  The compressed files I am using are valid files as they can be opened and played by Firefox and other programs, but when I run them through cws2fws the program gives an error 5 indicating that the files is corrupt.  I have downloaded the source for the program and compiled it using Visual Studio.  When I run my file through the newly compiled program I get the same result as from the program I downloaded from the web.  While debugging the program I noticed that the two of the four bytes that are used to determine the uncompressed file size of the swf are negative see line 64 below.p  precode00056     if bufin[0]  C  bufin[1]  W  bufin[2]  S 00057      00058         printfNot a compressed flash filen 00059         exit1 00060      00061  00062     fstatfdin, ampstatbuf 00063     complen  statbuf.stsize 00064     uncomplen  bufin[4]  bufin[5] ltlt 8  bufin[6] ltlt 16  bufin[7] ltlt 24 00065  00066     printfCompressed size d Uncompressed size dn, complen4, uncomplen4 codepre  pSo, my questions arep  p1  I am feeling a bit dense, so could someone please explain the logic of determining the file size from the 4 bytes as shown in line 64.

To me this indicates a bug in the program which has to do with signed and unsigned integers.

Negative 1307 pI just have a quick best practice question regarding custom cells in a UITableView. My problem arises when I have build a custom cell in the ifcell  nil block in thep  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView theTableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath codepre  p1 If I build labels and set the text property of these inside the cell  nil block only the cells visible on the screen will have the correct text in them, the rest will just be reused.p  p2 Ok, so I try moving the building of the custom cell outside the block. This of course results in my cells getting redrawn over and over again each time a user scrolls and on top of each other.p  p3 I also tried placing the drawing of the custom cell labels, graphics etc. inside the cell  nil block, but setting the labels.text property after the block. This cant be done as my   UILabels then cant be accessed from outside the block they were instantiated in. I could do some crazy forUILabel l in cell.contentView.subviews  but that would require an if statement for each label and probably some tags to identify them with.p  p4 I could then declare all my labels before the cell  nil block and then just do the instantiation and drawing inside the block and setting the text property after the cell  nil block. But as I passed 10 UIlabels this looks and feels really messy, having them spread out like this inside and outside the cell  nil block, plus they would be declared each time the table has to refresh.p  pThe reason I ask is because when using 24 labels I have always found a way around it, but this time I need 12 custom UILabels set up and I would like to do it so that I have to redraw the least amount of graphics, as there probably will be a lot of cells.p  pI have seen examples where people and the Apple docs uses ap  precode void configureCellUITableViewCell cell atIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath  codepre  pBut I cant really see how that would help me outp  pHope someone could point out a best practice for these sort of things.p  pThank youp

Negative 1307 pPosted Mon Nov 30, 2009 508 pm    Post subject Simple Problem With Intent Extras  Hello, p  pIm working on an app widget for the home screen. Im trying to make it so when a user taps on the widget it changes the data being displayed in the widget. However, Im also allowing multiple instances of widgets open with different data. So in order to tell my method which widget to update, Im adding an extra to the intent that is launched to change the data. p  pHeres the intent I have  Javap  precodeIntent changeData  new Intentcom.tonycosentini.mintdroid.CHANGEDATA  changeData.putExtrawidgetid, currentWidgetId  PendingIntent changeDataPendingIntent  PendingIntent.getBroadcastthis, 0, changeData, 0  This will return the correct value, but if I call it in my onreceive method it wont. Log.vTAG, stored id is   changeData.getIntExtrawidget, 0 codepre  pThis correctly stores the widget id, but when the change data method is called, the widget id that is read from the intent is the first widget instance. That is, there is is a for loop that generates all of the widgets and no matter what widget you tap, the widget id that is recieved is always the first widget id in the first widget. p  pAnyone have an idea on how to solve this Hopefully I didnt word it too poorly. p  pThanks for reading,  Tonyp

It seems that GUID is based on time and v1 uses a MAC address with v4 using a RNG.p  pFrom the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGUIDAlgorithm relnofollowwikiap  blockquote   pCryptanalysis of the WinAPI  GUID   generator shows that, since the   sequence of V4 GUIDs is pseudorandom   given full knowledge of the internal   state, it is possible to predict   previous and subsequent values.p blockquote  pDo i need to worry about this say when generating cookie data for users or password reset keysp  pMy question is how do i use GUID properly and how do i prevent creating the same GUID say via two threads on same machine created during same millisecond and how do i use it in a way it wont reveal previous keys. I switch from using async RNG to sync RNG locking between threads to GUID and now i think there may be a problem with this.p

This code will refer to various other items in the list.p  pSo, for example, one item lets call it codeItem0001code has this codegetcode accessor that may need to execute some code that may look something like thisp  precode[some code to get the following items from the list here]  ifItem0002.Value  Item0003.Value gt Item0004.Value  return Item0002.Value  else  return Item0004.Value  codepre  pWhich is all well and good, but these bits of code are likely to change on a weekly basis, so Im trying to avoid redeploying that often. Also, each item could will have wildly different code. Some will be querying the list, some will be doing some longass math functions, some will be simple addition as above...some will depend on variables not contained in the list.p  pWhat Id like to do is to store the code for each item in a table in my database, then when the app starts just pull the relevant code out and bung it in a list, ready to be executed when the time comes.p  pMost of the examples Ive seen on the internot regarding executing a string as code seem quite longwinded, convoluted, andor not particularly novicecoder friendly Im a complete amateur, and dont seem to take into account being passed variables.p  pSo the questions arep  ol liIs there an easiersimpler way of achieving what Im trying to doli liIf 1false Im guessing thats the case, is it worth the effort of all the potential problems of this approach, or would my time be better spent writing an automatic update feature into the application and just keeping it all inside the main app so the user would just have to let the app update itself once a weekli liAnother probably bad idea I had was shifting all the autospec code out to a separate DLL, and either just redeploying that when necessary, or is it even possible to reference a single DLL on a shared network driveli ol  pI guess this is some pretty dangerous territory whichever way I go. Can someone tell me if Im opening a can of worms best left well and truly shutp  pIs there a better way of going about this whole thing I have a habit of overcomplicating things that Im trying to kick Pp  pJust as additional info, the autospec code will not be userinput.

Negative 1307 pIm developing a web application at the moment. The web application needs to access a Patients database, which for now is a simple MySQL database but may likely be replaced by some other DB or data source in the future.

Negative 1307 pDoes anybody know if it is possible to capture something like a resource or connection id using the HTML WebSocket specification so that you can reuse or reopen a connection from a previous page.  Use case would be I establish a web socket connection while on one page, then the user navigates to a separate page but I dont want to reestablish a new connection but rather use the previous one.  You may be asking why let the user completely refresh the page and its a legitimate question but not for this use case  p  pThanks.p
Negative 1307 pBelow i have two tablesp  pstrongusersstrong and strongusersprofilesstrongp  pBoth are innoDB and collation utf8generalcip  pThey are as follows  p  pstrongusersstrongp  precodeCREATE TABLE users  uid int11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT, status char10 NOT NULL, username varchar15 NOT NULL, email varchar50 NOT NULL, password char32 NOT NULL, regdate int11 NOT NULL, ip varchar39 DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY uid, UNIQUE KEY username username,email  ENGINEInnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 codepre  pstrongusersprofilesstrongp  precodeCREATE TABLE usersprofiles  uid int11 NOT NULL, firstname varchar40 DEFAULT NULL, lastname varchar50 DEFAULT NULL, gender char6 DEFAULT NULL, website varchar100 DEFAULT NULL, msn varchar60 DEFAULT NULL, aim varchar60 DEFAULT NULL, yim varchar60 DEFAULT NULL, twitter varchar15 DEFAULT NULL, UNIQUE KEY uid uid  ENGINEInnoDB DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 codepre  pAfter creating the tables in phpmyadmin i created a foreign key on the usersprofiles table, code below is what phpmyadmin created.p  pas followsp  precodeALTER TABLE usersprofiles ADD CONSTRAINT usersprofilesibfk1 FOREIGN KEY uid REFERENCES users uid ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE codepre  pbasically the usersprofiles.uid is a foreign key and references the users.uidp  pIn phpmyadmin i go to stronginsertstrong and fill in some sample data leaving the uid obviously to auto increment. When i have inserted a record in users table i goes into the usersprofiles table and notice the users.uid is not inserted automatically in the usersprofiles,p  pIs this normal p  pReason is when someone for example registers on a form, they will be asked for username, email and password, and i do a query in php to insert that data into strongusersstrong table, i thought that because i have a foreign key that it would also automatically insert a row in the usersprofiles table with the uid from users table so there is a link between the user and there profile. But when i insert a record into users table the users.uid is not inserted into the usersprofiles table.p  pI tried another example to see what would happen and this one works as i would expect due to the cascade on update and delete.p  pIf i insert a row in strongusersstrong table and then manually insert the users.uid into usersprofiles.uid they are now linked and add for example my firstname and lastname then in phpmyadmin delete the user from users table it deletes the row in the usersprofiles table. This works like it should obviously as i dont want a user to be deleted and have there profile remain. p  pThis has confused me as when i do create a form and a user signs up, they essentially would not have a profile because on signup no profile is created for them with there users.uid in the userprofiles table no link between them althou i have a foreign key.p  pCan some explain why its not working as i expect, maybe it should be working like i want it to but something is wrong or i am missing the whole point i guess otherwise.p  pSorry for going on to much as per usual, i am not great at explaining things in small detail. Please forgive me for that.p  pThanksbr PHPLOVERp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIn reference to reply from Mark Wilkinsp  pI understand what you mean now. But something i am not 100 sure on is thisp  puser signs up, a record is created in users table they login and visit profile page where the can fill it in and submit the form.p  pOn processing the form am i rite in thinking i would need to do the followingp  puser filled in profile form and submitted first time they submitted profile as they are a new user, after validating data etc i first check to see if the uid in the users table match a uid in the usersprofile table, if theres a match then UPDATE record with new values this would mean the user has previously filled in there profile as on signup they dont have one but if no match is found on uid from both tables then i would perform an INSERT query because no profile yet exists for the user. I take it that obviously i would store the uid from users table in session with other data on successful login and the uid in session would be the uid that is inserted into the usersprofiles table in column uid  that way a link is created between two tables and if i now decide to delete the user there profile will also be deleted to.p

Negative 1307 pI am using codeGroupLayoutcode for my main layout, and baseline alignment works fine, until I add internal panels.

Negative 1307 pI have been reading and learning about NoSQL and MongoDB, CouchDB, etc, for the last two days, but I still cant tell if this is the right kind of storage for me.p  pWhat worries me is the eventual consistency thing. Does that type of consistency only kick in when using clusters Im hosting my sites in a single dedicated server, so I dont know if I can benefit from NoSQL For which kind of applications is OK to have eventual consistency instead of ACID, and for which ones it isnt Can you give me some examples Whats the worst thing that can happen in an application for which is OK to have eventual consistencyp  pAnother thing that I read is that MongoDB keeps a lot of things in memory. In the docs it says something about 32bit systems having a 2gb limit of data. Is that because of the ram limitation for 32bit systemsp

Negative 1307 pIm experiencing an issue with chromes click behavior. There are cases havnt been able to isolate the exact conditions, maybe dragging, dblclick, too quick... no idea chrome will stop triggering the onmouseup event and the tabs wont slide anymore Tested the issue on ff and ie, which work fine. I did however notice that there is a workaround by setting the return value to false. This isnt useful on a website as this would disable any clicking action... I cant seem to find anybody else with this exact same issue. This is the page a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netsteveterm7T9N8 relnofollowJS Fiddleap  pNote 1 If the animation function is called directly  overriding any click events no issues occur.

Any alternatives for this.p  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta charsetutf8gt  lttitlegtjQuery Mobile Testing Web Applttitlegt ltlink relstylesheet hrefhttpcode.jquery.commobile1.0jquery.mobile1.0.min.css gt ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.6.4.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.commobile1.0jquery.mobile1.0.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltbodygt   ltdiv datarolepage idpagegt     ltdiv dataroleheadergt          lta href relexternal dataajaxfalse datarolebutton dataiconhome datathemebgt Dashboard ltagt         lth1gtTesting Documentlth1gt      ltdivgt     ltdiv datarolecontentgt     ltform methodPOST action dataajaxfalsegt         ltdiv datarolefieldcontaingt           ltul datarolelistview datainsettruegt             ltli datarolelistdividergt lth3gt Services lth3gt ltligt              ltli datathemeagt Class 1 ltligt             ltligt ltlabel forflipbgtElement1ltlabelgt                 ltselect nameelement1 idflipb dataroleslidergt                     ltoption valuenogtNoltoptiongt                     ltoption valueyesgtYesltoptiongt                 ltselectgt              ltligt                ltligt ltlabel forflipbgtElement2ltlabelgt                 ltselect nameelement2 idflipb dataroleslidergt                     ltoption valuenogtNoltoptiongt                     ltoption valueyesgtYesltoptiongt                 ltselectgt              ltligt               ltligt ltlabel forflipbgtElement3ltlabelgt                 ltselect nameelement3 idflipb dataroleslidergt                     ltoption valuenogtNoltoptiongt                     ltoption valueyesgtYesltoptiongt                 ltselectgt              ltligt               ltligt ltlabel forflipbgtElement4ltlabelgt                 ltselect nameelement4 idflipb dataroleslidergt                     ltoption valuenogtNoltoptiongt                     ltoption valueyesgtYesltoptiongt                 ltselectgt              ltligt               ltligt ltlabel forflipbgtElement5ltlabelgt                 ltselect nameelement5 idflipb dataroleslidergt                     ltoption valuenogtNoltoptiongt                     ltoption valueyesgtYesltoptiongt                 ltselectgt              ltligt               ltligt ltlabel forflipbgtElement6ltlabelgt                 ltselect nameelement6 idflipb dataroleslidergt                     ltoption valuenogtNoltoptiongt                     ltoption valueyesgtYesltoptiongt                 ltselectgt              ltligt                ltligt                      ltlabel forselectchoice1 classselectgtMain Locationltlabelgt                        ltselect namemainlocation idselectchoice1gt                           ltoption valueNSWgtNSWltoptiongt                           ltoption valueACTgtACTltoptiongt                           ltoption valueVICgtVICltoptiongt                           ltoption valueSAgtSAltoptiongt                           ltoption valueQLDgtQLDltoptiongt                           ltoption valueNTgtNTltoptiongt                           ltoption valueWAgtWAltoptiongt                           ltoption valueTASgtTASltoptiongt                         ltselectgt                                    ltligt lt Select Menus Main Locationgt                      ltulgt         ltdivgt lt End of Field Contain div tag gt        ltbutton type submit datarolebutton datainlinefalse dataiconsearch dataiconposleft datathemebgtSearchltbuttongt        ltformgt    ltdivgt lt End of Content div tag gt      ltdiv datarolefootergt         lth6gt2012 ampcopylth6gt     ltdivgt  ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 1307 pI have been looking around for a solution that implements this, but google always gives me tutorials on establishing a live chat over an ssh tunnelnot the other way around.

Negative 1307 pMy understanding is that codewidth 100code lets the objects width be the same as its parents, whereas codewidth inheritcode does that only when the parents width is explicitly specified. Is this understanding correctp  pIf so, it looks to me that when codewidth inheritcode works, then codewidth 100code would always work, so you could always use the latter. Then, what is the purpose of writing codewidth inheritcode When does it become usefulp  pIf my understanding is wrong, what is the difference between the twop  pSimilarly with codeheightcode.p

Negative 1307 pIm trying to run a Java application that is supposed to take in several hundred at least zippostal codes and placing markers on a given map using JavaScript. Ive got the map out, and Im able to place markers on it, but once I hit past 20 markers I start getting the OVERQUERYLIMIT error.p  pIve done my homework and discovered that this is due to my clientside geocoding, and tried to look up methods to do serverside geocoding but havent been very successful. Im now attempting to store all the latitudelongitude pairs within a given database. Every time a new postalzip code is entered into the dataset, my application should the geocode the given postalzip code and search up the given latlong pair before placing it into the database.p  pEvery time I view the map, the application will attempt to pull the latlong pairs out of the database which will be stored as String values and place markers on the map. The problem is, Im not sure how to do that. Can markers be placed solely using latitudelongitude pairs If so, how can this be donep  pJust to clarify, the application is a Java one, using Servlets to handle the data and .jsp pages to print the maps.p

Negative 1307 pI am using Hibernate to map to a legacy data model that I am not able to change.

Negative 1307 pI have a moderately complex application using POJOs, and now come to migrated it to EJB3.1 so it can be deployed online, accessed through REST services and benefit from the container environment persistence being the most major, but transactions would be useful too.p  pI have been away from Java EE since the J2EE days, and am struggling to get my head around the loss of entity beans.  It took me a while to realise that Entities in EJB3.1 are not actually Beans in the old sense...   I have read a number of EJB3 books including the OReilly Enterprise JavaBeans 3.1 manual, all of which explain the concepts and components of EJB3 but not the implementation pattern options.p  pIn my research and investigation looking for Java EE 6 patterns Im rather taken by Adam Biens approach  particularly the Persistent Domain Objects PDO pattern in his book but summarised here too a hrefhttpdownload.java.netgeneralpodcastsrealworldjavaeepatterns.pdfhttpdownload.java.netgeneralpodcastsrealworldjavaeepatterns.pdfa, which appears to offer the least complexity and most synergy with my current POJO app.  PDO also closelyaligns with the traditional Object Oriented philosophies and approach, and really appeals to me.p  pRather than resparking a debate over PDO, Im interested to hear from people that have implemented it and what worked vs. where you had difficulties.  In particular Id like to find out how you made calls strongfromstrong JPA entities out into other services in the container like calls to stateless session beans etc.p  pId also love to know if there are alternatives to the PDO pattern that allow me to maintain the application structure using polymorphism etc without having to create a session bean and a JPA entity for every class in my model.  I dont want to do that partly because of the massive exercise required to refactor all of the unit and integration tests, and partly because  as far as I can see  Ill end up trying to replicate my 1toMany etc object relationship across my session beans too which seems crazy.  p  pDoes anyone have any experiences to share  or if youd like to point out Im an idiot and have missed something fundamental in Java EE 6 that would be welcome too p  pTIAp

Negative 1307 pIm using the Datepicker in two input fields to allow users to select a start and end date, respectively.  I was curious if theres a setting for jQuery UIs datepicker to initialize the start date field to a period that is two complete months prior to the end date, which defaults to the current date.  So when a user opens the page, the end date will be the current date and the start date will display the two complete months prior to the current date, e.g. end date is initialized to 432012, the start date would be 2112.p  pI was going to write some custom formula to handle this, but wanted to be sure there wasnt already a setting for this built into the Datepicker.p

As a consequence, these languages can describe iterative processes only by resorting to specialpurpose looping constructs such as do, repeat, until, for, and while.p blockquote  pI am not familiar with C language, what about Java or C Is this true with them as well And whyp  pemstrongNote I thought the author is talking about abilities of different languages.

Negative 1307 pI have an application where we want the user to either be able to run it using the camera on their phone and feed the camera bytes into our library or to use a jpeg sequence and feed those images in instead. We are planning on shipping with a few different image sequences, which will be packaged up into the assets folder on the device. Our API supports loading images either as a file path, or as the actual bytes of the image.p  pWhat is the best way to go about feeding in the jpeg imagesp  pAs I see it, I have two choices  p  ol liLoad the bytes of the jpeg directly out of the AssetManager and pass them to my API as bytes. This would mean that I am constantly pulling the bytes of each file of the AssetManager. I intend to do some profiling on what the cost is of doing this, but maybe someone already knows that the cost is too high.li liCopy all of the images into the cache folder and then load them by filename. It seems to me that performancewise, this approach is better, but it requires much more overhead up front, and will obviously take up much more space on the users device. For now we have a limitation that each image sequence will be less than 30 seconds, so 30fps30seconds  900images.li ol  pThanks for your help.p

I would like a blog inside that area on the blog page, so a blog on a separate page with its own layout is not what Im looking for.  p  pGoogling this doesnt really help me much since the majority of the hits are on sites offering blog services. p  pThanks in advance, I hope Im not being too difficult. Please leave some feedback on my question if you think there are things I should have tried out before asking. p

Negative 1307 pIm new to knockout and trying to get what should be a simple task up and running.

Negative 1307 pI have been playing around with clojurescriptone   neat project  to try and understand how clojurescript works. It is not clear to me how the three components, browser, browser repl and the http server interact.p  pI use emacs for my development environmentp  pTo understand ClojureScriptCS better I decided to try and port clojurescriptoneCS1 to use lein2 and use nrepl as my repl. The port did work and I was able to get the CS1 environment going and interact with the browser. I prefer  for now  not to start an inferior lisp process to work with the CS repl, but instead run the CS repl within the clojure repl. The only drawback with this is that the CS repl takes input from stdin and emacs prompts me to use stdin. To get around this I am trying to replace some code in CS1 so that it starts the repl from the piggieback library written by Chas Emerick.p  pIn doing so I have reached the limits of my understanding of how these components interact. Apparently from what I can gather the browser repl is a server that listens on some port while all along I thought it was some sort of client that send requests to the http server and redirected the output to the browser how after evaluating the result. Now I am not certain that is the case.p  pHow do these components interact p  pSorry about the long explanationp  pSidp

Negative 1307 pIve looked everywhere but there doesnt seem to be a standard I could see of how one would go about checking to see if an image is blank. In Cp  pI have a way of doing this, but would love to know what the correct way is of checking to see if an image is blank, so everyone could also know in the future.p  pIm not going to copy paste a bunch of code in, if you want me to, it will be my pleasure, but I just first want to explain how i go about checking to see if an image is blank.p  pYou take a .jpg image, Get the width of it. For example 500 pixels  Then you divide that by 2 giving you 250p  pThen you check what the colour of every pixel is in the location of 250 width, and i height where you iterate thought the hight of the image. p  pWhat this then do is only check the middle line of pixels of an image, vertically. It goes though all the pixels checking to see if the colour is anything Except white. Ive done this so you wont have to search ALL 500height of pixels and since you will almost always come across a colour in the middle of the page.p  pIts working... a bit slow...There must be a better way to do this You can change it to search 234 lines vertically to increase your chance to spot a page thats not blank, but that will take even longer.p  pAlso note, using the size of the image to check if it contains something will not work in this case, since a page with two sentences on and a blank pages size is too close to one anotherp  pstrongAfter solution has been added.strongp  pResources to help with the implementation and understanding of the solution.p  ul lia hrefhttpwww.csharpcorner.comUploadFilegregorypopekWritingUnsafeCode11102005040251AMWritingUnsafeCode.aspx relnofollowWriting unsafe code  pointers in Cali lia hrefhttpwww.csharpcorner.comUploadFilepcurnowusingpointers10022007082330AMusingpointers.aspx relnofollowUsing Pointers in Cali lia hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryct597kb0.aspx relnofollowunsafe C Compiler Optionsali lia hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary5ey6h79d.aspx relnofollowBitmap.LockBits Method Rectangle, ImageLockMode, PixelFormatali ul  pNote that on the first website, the stated Pizelformat is actually Pixelformat  Small error i know, just mentioning, might cause some confusion to some.p  pAfter I implemented the method to speed up the pixel hunting, the speed didnt increase that much.

Negative 1307 pI created a Dialog using LinearLayout and in this Dialog, I have a Button. I want to set its width to 50 of the Dialogs width, but no matter what I do, the button is still filling the entire width. The main problem seems to be that I cannot set the buttons weight programmatically. I tried creating a second horizontal LinearLayout that would hold the button with weight set to 0.5f the parent has a weightSum of 1, but that did not change anything. How can I set the button to be half the widthp  pIve looked at all the other questions but most of them were using xml so they were not relevant, and the one that solved it programmatically was using hardcoded values in pixels which is obviously an incorrect solution to the problem.p  pEDIT Adding some codep  precodeLinearLayout linearLayout  new LinearLayoutmContext linearLayout.setOrientationLinearLayout.VERTICAL linearLayout.setWeightSum1   I use these params when I call addContentView LinearLayout.LayoutParams layoutParams  new LinearLayout.LayoutParamsLinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, LinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT  testButton  new ButtonmContext testButton.setTextTest testButton.setId1 testButton.setWidth0 testButton.setGravityGravity.CENTER  LinearLayout buttonLayout  new LinearLayoutmContext butonLayout.setOrientationLinearLayout.HORIZONTAL  LinearLayout.LayoutParams buttonParams  new LinearLayout.LayoutParamsLinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, LinearLayout.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, 0.5f testButton.setLayoutParamsbuttonParams buttonLayout.addViewtestButton  linearLayout.addViewbuttonLayout  ...  this.addContentViewscrollView, layoutParams codepre

Negative 1307 pLets say I have sampled some signals and constucted a vector of the samples for each. What is the most efficent way to calculate dissimilarity of those vectors Note that offset of the sampling must not count, for instance samplevectors of sin and cos signals should be considered similar since in sequential manner they are exately the same.p  pThere is a simple way of doing this by rolling the units of the other vector, calculating euclidian distance for each rollpoint and finally choosing the best match smallest distance. This solution works fine since the only target for me is to find most similar samplevector for input signal from a vector pool. p  pHowever, the solution above is also very inefficent when the dimension of the vectors grow. Compared to nonsequential vector matching for Ndimensional vector, the sequential one would have Ntimes more vector distance calculations to do.p  pIs there any higherbetter mathematicsalgorithms to compare two sequences with differing offsetsp  pUse case for this would be in sequence similarity visualization with SOM.p  pstrongEDITstrong How about comparing each vectors integrals and entropies Both of them are sequencesafe  timeinvariant and very fast to calculate but I doubt they alone are enough to distinguish all possible signals from each other. Is there something else that could be used in addition for thesep  pstrongEDIT2strong Victor Zamanians reply isnt directly the answer but it gave me an idea that might be. The solution might be to sample the original signals by calculating their Fourier transform coefficents and inserting those into sample vectors. First element X0 is the mean or level of the signal and the following Xn can be directly used to compare similarity with some other sample vector. The smaller the n is, the more it should have effect in similarity calculations, since the more coefficents there has been calculated with FT, the more accurate representation will the FTd signal be. This brings up an strongbonus questionstrong p  pLets say we have FT6 sampled vectors values just fell out of the skyp  ul liX  4, 15, 10, 8, 11, 7li liY  4, 16, 9, 15, 62, 7li ul  pSimilarity value of these vectors could MAYBE be calculated like this 1615  10  9 strong 2strong   8  15 strong 3strong  1162 strong 4strong  77 strong 5strongp  pThose bolded ones are the bonus question.

Negative 1307 pI decided to add custom GetSetValuewith INotifyPropertyChanged helper functions in my ViewModelBaseClass similar to the type safe method mentioned a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma13215202259130herea. But I want to add optional initializer to the Get helper Function which has sane defaults. Unfortunately the default keyword initializes reference types to null, nullable value types to null, and value types to default values. p  pI want to make a generic function that would be called by the Get helper that returns default values for types, default values values for BaseType for Nullableif possible, and default constructors for reference types that have default constructors. For reference types that dont implement the constructor I guess it could return null. But figuring out how to call new T vs defaultT in an if else is difficult, the compiler says it doesnt have the right constraintsbecause of course constrains are checked at runtime.p  pAs an alternative I suppose I could use Jon Skeets a hrefhttpmsmvps.comblogsjonskeetarchive20101102evilcodeoverloadresolutionworkaround.aspx relnofollowhttpmsmvps.comblogsjonskeetarchive20101102evilcodeoverloadresolutionworkaround.aspxa on the Get helper method   of which he said p  blockquote   pThis is possibly the most horrible code Ive ever written.p      pPlease, please dont use it in real life. Use different method names   or something like that.   Still, its a fun little puzzle, isnt itp blockquote  p as a benefit it would might allow me to force reference types without default constructors to specify a non optional init Func.p

Negative 1307 pWhat Im trying to do is have a user on my vBulletin forum post the latest news story from a website each time its generated using an RSS poster. Unfortunately the website does not have an RSS feed, so I created one based on the source code of the site. The feed pulls in the title amp link to the news post. I also want the description of the news post to show in the vBulletin post, so I created a php script shown below to collect the description of the post.p  pMy problem now is that with the RSS poster on vBulletin using the php script, it always updates all of its old posts to have the description from the latest post.

As far as I know, there is no way for dir to cause a TypeError. The TypeError and message associated with it are from my code as part of the customized setter function for the objects eqTest field, but a call to dir does not, of course, try to set eqTest to anything it has already been successfully set in the previous line.p  pThis all leads me to believe that something went wrong in the C code to produce such strange behavior. My current hypothesis is a buffer overflow writing past the bounds of an array changed something that is causing these errors. Asking MATCHERS[0] to match a string simply crashes Python with no error message Ive been going over the initialization code for a while and just thought I would check if there is anything else that could be causing this.p  pMy code is too long to include here and is on Pastebin a hrefhttppastebin.com0Jj5xhD4 relnofollowherea you can ignore everything after line 434 as it hasnt been executed yet.p

Negative 1307 pThis question is a bit more specific than what the title indicates. Ive tried several methods, hoping to get the request XML to deserialize into an object, with nothing but problems.  Read on, and please just make a suggestion for some ideas for me to look into.p  pThe Problems br br I am stuck receiving a POST in HL7 format.  This is approximately a 55k post with about 200 bytes of useful info in it. I only need to extract those few bytes.  Normally, this will only be about 30 bytes, depending how many tracking numbers are sent to me.  NO, I do not have any say in changing this. br br This HL7 data is in standard XML format, with the exception that a lot of Attributes are used to carry data, instead of Elements.  Again, I seem to be stuck with the sender doing it this way.  My preference, and experience with web services, is the standard MS SoapWSDL setup.  br br I have used XSD.exe to create a class to contain the deserialized data  from some sample XML that will be sent to me. , however, XSD seems to convert all attributes to elements.  When I view the resulting WCF service page, I dont see xml that looks like what I am receiving.  This difference seems to be preventing the deserialization of the HL7 request  See the following abbreviated samples br Sample of an abbreviated inbound requestbecause dealing with the 55k sample was killing my brain, just the first few lines brp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltQUQIIN300102XXX xmlnsurnhl7orgv3 ITSVersionXML1.0gt   ltrealmCode codeXXX gt   ltid extensionXX011111 gt   ltcreationTime value201212201334240500 gt   ltresponseModeCode codeIMMEDIATE gt   ltversionCode codeV3201012 gt   ltinteractionId extensionQUQIIN300102XXX gt   ltprocessingCode codeP gt   ltprocessingModeCode codeT gt   ltacceptAckCode codeNE gt   ltreceiver typeCodeRCVgt     ltrealmCode codeXXX gt     ltdevicegt       ltrealmCode codeXXX gt       ltid extensionXXXIB assigningAuthorityNameService gt     ltdevicegt   ltreceivergt   ltsender typeCodeSNDgt     ltrealmCode codeXXX gt     ltdevicegt       ltrealmCode codeXXX gt       ltid assigningAuthorityNameCCC gt     ltdevicegt   ltsendergt   ltcontrolActEventgt     ltrealmCode codeXXX gt     ltid extensionTracking assigningAuthorityNameTRANSTYPE gt     ltcode codeOrder gt     ltstatusCode gt     ltqueryByParametergt       ltrealmCode codeXXX gt       ltqueryId extensionNJ011111A20121220133343 gt       ltparameterListgt         ltrealmCode codeXXX gt         ltaccessionNumgt           ltvalue extensionNJ011111A gt         ltaccessionNumgt         ltbatchNumbergt           ltvalue extension120927001 assigningAuthorityNameZZ1 gt           ltvalue extension120927002 assigningAuthorityNameZZ1 gt         ltbatchNumbergt codepre  pbr br The batchNumber is the primary data I need to get from the inbound request. br If I view the WCF project service help page  created by using the WCF REST project type nuget package, if I remember correctly , I get brp  precodeltQUQIIN300102QDgt   ltrealmCodegt ltrealmCodegt   ltcodegtString contentltcodegt ltrealmCodegt ltrealmCodegt   ltcodegtString contentltcodegt ltrealmCodegt   ltrealmCodegt   ltidgt ltidgt   ltextensiongtString contentltextensiongt   ltassigningAuthorityNamegtString contentltassigningAuthorityNamegt ltidgt ltidgt   ltextensiongtString contentltextensiongt   ltassigningAuthorityNamegtString contentltassigningAuthorityNamegt ltidgt   ltidgt   ltcreationTimegt     ltQUQIIN300102QDCreationTimegt   ltvaluegtString contentltvaluegt    ltQUQIIN300102QDCreationTimegt   ltQUQIIN300102QDCreationTimegt     ltvaluegtString contentltvaluegt    ltQUQIIN300102QDCreationTimegt   ltcreationTimegt codepre  pbr br Now, the XML that I fed into XSD.exe does not look like what the service page hands out, and for whatever reason, when I pass in the post request, it will not deserialize. br br I hope thats enough information to describe my problem. br br What is my best choice for a solution br Create an MVC project and accept an XMLDoc as the post datatype, and do XML manipulations to get what I need Or some other option br FYI, the return data has to be inserted into the XML at some point, but I havent gotten that far yet. br br FYI, my experience with creating web services has been limited to VS.  You know, File, New Project, Web Service.  Then adding a proxy to the WSDL page in the consuming project and just using the thing.  With, of course, a third project just containing the class objects for reference by the other two projects, and some dataaccess project. br br Using Fiddler to compose my requests, and I have WCF tracing turned on. br What I get from the trace is brbrp  pUnable to deserialize XML body with root name Binary and root namespace  for operation methodTrackQLSBatch and contract ShipmentTracking,  a hrefhttptempuri.org relnofollowhttptempuri.orga using XmlSerializer. Ensure that the type corresponding to the XML is added to the known types collection of the service. brbr It DOES know the type.  If I change everything around to use a very simple piece of XML, it deserializes perfectly.  brbr Thank you in advance for any thoughts. brbr I guess to put it succinctly, how can I accept this large HL7 request, extract data from it, insert results into it, and then return it   And I can probably figure out the return it portion, heh.

Negative 1307 pIm using a primefaces datatable with single row selection and pagination. For each row I have some commandlinks one of which is disabled that I want the user to click to perform operations on that row example delete, edit. In order to provide visual confirmation that the user clicked the button on the right row, I want the row to be selected upon clicking and then proceed to the desired bean method. This is working as intended if the table has only one page or if its page 1 on all other pages I get a NullPointerException.br I figured out why this happens I use rowIndexVar to perform the selection but it seems to be returning the index related to the whole table and the selectRow method expects an index related to the current page. Meaning that if I have 10 rows per page and I click on the third row in the second page, the index returned is 12 and not 2 and selectRow12, false returns null as there are only 10 items on that page.  p  pMy question is strongemhow can I pass the correct rowIndex so I get the correct selection on all pagesemstrongp  pThe backing bean is ViewScoped and the methods arent nothing extraordinary but since it has a lot of code related to webservices and jaxb generated classes and I signed an NDA I cant paste it here Im already pushing it by sharing the datatable code.p  precodeltpdataTable iddataTable varitem rowIndexVarrowIndex     valuedgRefTypePubBean.itemList           widgetVaritemsTable     filteredValuedgRefTypePubBean.filteredItems paginatortrue     rows10     paginatorTemplateFirstPageLink PreviousPageLink CurrentPageReport NextPageLink LastPageLink RowsPerPageDropdown     rowsPerPageTemplate2,5,10,20 rowKeyitem.EID     selectiondgRefTypePubBean.selectedItem selectionModesingle     emptyMessagemsgs[dgreftype.datatable.message.emptyList]     resizableColumnsfalsegt      ltpajax eventpage oncompleteitemsTable.unselectAllRows itemsTable.selectRow0, false gt     ltpajax eventrowSelect listenerdgRefTypePubBean.onRowSelect         updateformobs formindexinfo formeliminationjust formleftfooter formrightfooter gt     ltpajax eventrowUnselect listenerdgRefTypePubBean.onRowUnselect updateformobs gt      ltpcolumn styletextalignright width22px bordernone backgroundwhitegt         lthgraphicImage rendereditem.EState2 libraryimages namedatadelete.png width15 height15 stylebordernone padding0 gt     ltpcolumngt     ltpcolumn idcodColumn headerTextmsgs[dgreftype.datatable.label.functionalCode] filterStyleheight10px fontweightnormal styletextalignleft width120px filterByitem.EFunctionalCodegt         lthoutputText valueitem.EFunctionalCode gt     ltpcolumngt     ltpcolumn iddesignationColumn headerTextmsgs[dgreftype.datatable.label.name] filterStyleheight10px fontweightnormal styletextalignleft wordwrap breakword filterByitem.ENamegt         lthoutputText valueitem.EName gt     ltpcolumngt     ltpcolumn idvariableColumn headerTextmsgs[dgreftype.datatable.label.variableTypeName] filterStyleheight10px fontweightnormal styletextalignleft width200px filterByitem.EVariableTypeNamegt         lthoutputText valueitem.EVariableTypeName gt     ltpcolumngt     ltpcolumn idbuttonsColumn stylewidth55pxgt         lthpanelGrid columns3 stylebordercollapseseparate bordernone importantgt             lthcommandLink onclickitemsTable.unselectAllRows itemsTable.selectRowrowIndex, false actiondgRefTypePubBean.editSelectedItemgt                 lthgraphicImage libraryimages nameedittext.png width15 height15 stylebordernone gt             lthcommandLinkgt             lthgraphicImage libraryimages namedetaildisabled.png width15 height15 stylebordernone onclickitemsTable.unselectAllRows itemsTable.selectRowrowIndex, false gt             lthcommandLink onclickitemsTable.unselectAllRows itemsTable.selectRowrowIndex, false confirmation.show return falsegt                 lthgraphicImage libraryimages nameeditdelete.png width15 height15 stylebordernone gt             lthcommandLinkgt         lthpanelGridgt     ltpcolumngt ltpdataTablegt codepre  pIm using JSF 2.0 and Primefaces 3.4.2.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1307 pthis is my first post so excuse the novice like remarks. Im okay with PHP but I seem to be missing something here obviously. Im looking to redirect users after they have logged in depending on the usergroup they are assigned. So members will go to the members area, admin to admin area, and finally superadmin to the superadmin area. The code was recently working but seems to have stopped after I added a Javascript dropdown menu for links at the top of the webpage. I have narrowed the problem down to this snippetp  precode    ifcount1           Register myusername, mypassword and redirect to file loginsuccess.php         SESSION[myusername]  myusername         SESSION[mypassword]  mypassword         SESSION[myusergroup]  myusergroup             ifusergroup  SuperAdmin             headerlocationsuperadminloginsuccess.php             exit                          elseifusergroup  Admin             headerlocationadminloginsuccess.php             exit                          elseifusergroup  Member             headerlocationloginsuccess.php             exit                   codepre  pThe count represents the results returned from the SQL query. The query selects all fields from a table where the username and passwords fields equal to the form i have submitted previously on login. All of my login PHP code is located on the same webpage and an if statement at the beginning of the PHP prevent the code from being executed when the form hasnt been submitted. Can anyone spot anything wrong with this snippet or my logic, Ive been staring and reading around the issue from people in similar situations and I still cant get anywhere. p  pAs you can see Im using the header function to redirect, and there is issues with the functions when print output onto the page before the header is called. Im not entirely sure on the specifics of the issue but if anyone can clarify and give and example, then I will be grateful. Is it appropriate and correct to write these scripts seperately and then include them when required Ive also been thinking about that.p  pMany Thanksp  pRhysp

I thought of to ways to do this which both do emnotem workp  pstrongChecking upload.onload eventstrongp  precodexhr.upload.addEventListenerload, function e      uploadprogress.attrvalue, false     uploadprogress.attrmax, false     progress.textChecking file...  codepre  pThis doesnt work, because the codeonloadcodeevent firest when the request is ready, not when upload is ready.p  pstrongChecking if upload progress percentage  100strongp  precodexhr.upload.addEventListenerprogress, function e      if e.lengthComputable ampamp e          p  e.loaded  e.total         if p1              uploadprogress.attrvalue, false             uploadprogress.attrmax, false             progress.textChecking file...          else              var percent  Math.ceilp  1000  10             uploadprogress.vale.loaded             uploadprogress.attrmax, e.total             progress.textUploading...   percent                  codepre  pThis does not work, because the upload percentage sometimes stops at approx. 97, despite the upload is finished and PHP starts handling the filesp  pIs there another possibility checking thisp

Negative 1307 pLet me know if you need additional information as this is my first post to the forums.p  pThe design is for clinical studies. Easiest way to explain would be to give an example to a scenario which applies to all studiesprotocols in some shape or form. Say I havep  ul liStudy1, Study2, Study3li liStudy1 has Protocol1, Protocol2, Protocol3li liEach protocol has data collection set of forms, questions and sample collections, which can overlap across studies andor protocolsli liAll these data collections are scheduled to be completed in clinic visits.li ul  pI can build all the relationships between Study, Protocol and Questions similar to a questionnairesurvey design structure. However this is where it gets tricky with the protocol definitions and how to link protocols back to the data collection items, some examples arep  ul liProtocol1 has a form that needs to be filled every 3 months after enrollment to 24 months, then every 6 months.li liProtocol1 has a sample collection at 6month, 15month, 27month and then annually.li liProtocol1 has another sample collection which needs to happen at the age of 4, 5 and 6.li liSome data collection items are at the enrollment, some are every visit, etc..li ul  pWhat I want is to have a Todo list for that clinic visit for a specific patient based on all the relationships between studyprotocoldatacollection but I am not sure how to define these conditional criteria for protocols at the backend to be able to query or am I trying to do something unrealisticp  pI am using SQL Server by the wayp

Negative 1307 pDoes tmux allow us to do this p  pWhat im trying to configure is a commandline where you are to enter a pane that you intend to move somewhere, and whats quite unfortunate is that once you hit any key during the displaypanes display dismisses it. It would be awfully convenient to be able to see the displaypanes enumeration of the panes during the entering of the command. p  pWhat Im accomplishing with the command script is to specify a window to join. since tmux does not let us join a pane to the same window that its already in, I am scripting it to break the pane out of the window. I believe Ill need to use runshell to script this up, but thats not related to this question of if it is possible to somehow get it to display the pane indices during the command prompt. p

Negative 1307 pI was under the impression that an codeobject poolcode is a design pattern used for managing a group of preallocated objects to which a client can request and be returned one of these objects.  However, it seems that codeboost.poolcodes codeobjectpoolcode class has more to do with lowerlevel memory management than object management.  Why did they go with this name, as opposed to something like codememorypoolcode  Am I under the wrong impression that boosts object pool is really a memory pooling scheme  Or are they essentially the same thing  Also, why hasnt there been a standard implementation of a more highlevel object pool patternp

Negative 1307 pI need to add a new method that computes connected components to OpenCV 2.4.4 to use in one of my own projects.  I already have the code for the function from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4641817blobextractioninopencv1011659110116591this questiona Thanks to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers1327999jasonjasona, I navigated my way to a hrefhttpcode.opencv.orgattachments467opencvconnectedcomponents.patch relnofollowthe patcha where I found both the code and the header.p  pWhat I did was to add a new file codeconnectedcomponents.cppcode in codeCopencvmodulesimgprocsrccode, in which I placed the code for this new function.  Next, I went to codeCopencvmodulesimgprocincludeopencv2imgproccode and I added the appropriate export header to codeimgproc.hppcode.  Finally, I rebuilt the codeopencvimgproccode project in the OpenCV source code using Visual Studio 2010.  Everything builds fine, and generates the codeopencvimgproc244.dllcode, codeopencvimgproc244.libcode, and codeopencvimgproc244.expcode files for me.p  pNow, I copy these files except for the .exp, where I cant find where it should go into my existing OpenCV directory and replace the old files.  When I now try to build my own project, everything still builds fine, but I cannot access the new method from here.  I include codeinclude ltopencv2imgprocimgproc.hppgtcode, and from here I can access all the other methods in the file, except for the new one that I want.p  pThe fact that everything compiles but that the method is not exposed leads me to think there is some other file that I should have changed as well, however, due to lack of experience I do not know where or what this file could be.p  pExtra information I am using Visual Studio 2010, OpenCV 2.4.4 and built OpenCV with CMake 2.8.10.2 I am aware that there are libaries such as a hrefhttpopencv.willowgarage.comwikicvBlobsLib relnofollowcvBlobsLiba that compute connected components, and I have successfully used these in my project.  However, I want a faster and more recent solution cvBlobsLib still uses the old IplImage.p
Negative 1307 pI have a process that is writing to standard out, and I want to be able to monitor the output by grepping for various strings while running tail f. One way to do this is to write to a normal file and then tail the file grepping for one string, then tail it grepping for another. However, I dont want to write to a file because this will fill up the disk, and I dont want to deal with the hassle of rotating log files.p  pI thought I could achieve this using fifos. E.g.,p  precodemkfifo myfifo foo gt myfifo amp tail f myfifo  grep bar tail f myfifo  grep baz codepre  pUnfortunately, this doesnt seem to work. In fact, the only way I see any output when tailing is when I first execute codetail f myfifocode and then codefoo gt mfifocode, but I dont want to restart foo thats the whole point, otherwise I can just grep standard out directly and restart the process to grep for a different string. Does anyone know why this is happening or have a suggestion for how to achieve thisp

Negative 1307 pI am hoping you guys could help me understand how relocation entries and ELF section data are related, and how it is all processed and generated.  p  pI have an ancient unsupported tool that takes an ELF file and a related PLF file partially linked file, generated earlier in the build process and builds a custom relocatable file from it that is used on a platform PPC with tight memory constraints.  This works fine except that it contains about a meg of initialization code that we want to unload after start up.  So we put all that init code in a custom section in order to unload it, but unfortunately, the tool fails to properly handle custom sections and the rel file is invalid.  So my task is to make a new tool that correctly generates this relocatable file with the custom section in it.  p  pIve gotten relatively far with this tool and generating the rel file, but am currently bogged down in trying to figure out how to process the section data and build the relocation entries, etc.  I am a highlevel programmer way out of my element with this task, so all this reverse engineering business is new to me thank goodness for the internet.p  pI found a hrefhttpantmicro.comprojectselfsharpindex.shtml relnofollowElf Sharpa and used that as a starting point.  It allows me to load both ELF and PLF files and interact with their contents.  From there, Ive reverse engineered the relocation files header and contents for the most part, but its far from accurate.  When I compare the old tools version of the file to mine, I find that some of the section data has been fixed up while my file uses the section data straight out of the PLF file and is plain.  What I mean by this is the section data I copied over contains a ton of 48 00 00 01, but these are all fixed up in some way by the old tool.  What is the significance of those bytes, and what is being done to them  I also have to generate the relocation entries but am unsure how to proceed.p  pI found a few examples of processing elf relocations online, and I have something similar up and running in my tool, but Im still pretty unclear just what exactly I am supposed to be doing.  I have a good resource for all the relocation types and their formulas chapter 4.12.5 a hrefhttpswww.power.orgwpcontentuploads201207PowerArch32bitABIsupp1.0Embedded.pdf relnofollowherea, but Im still not quite sure what offsets, sections info, etc I should be using.p  pTLDRp  ul lipCan you help me visualize what exactly is happening with these relocation entries, how it is all generated and processed, and how it is used when the program is executedpli lipWhat has been done to all the 48 00 00 01 words in the section data  Im assuming theyve been resolved with the appropriate symbols, but how was this done  Using the .rela informationpli lipAlso, Im not sure when I should use the PLF contents and when I should use the ELF contents.  I think I only need the ELF to get the load address and segment information.pli lipWhen I generate the relocation fixups on PPC, how exactly do I evaluate the relocation type equations  The examples I referred to online are not intuitive on that point.  Im confused with the offsets  you get one from Elf32Rela, but is that the one you modify  And what is the offset that is used to record the result of the fixup  What exactly is the addend  I havent found anything online that is all that enlightening.pli lipSome actually most of the relocation fixups point to one of several .debugemem sections or .bss.  Should I skip the .debug fixups or are those important  .bss is a NoBits section so how do I handle that  And when it comes to actually generating the relocation entries, I understand how they are constructed, but whowhat is actually behind making the entries  I mean, Im ready to build it, but I dont know where to start  do I iterate over some data somewhere or whatpli lipAny other questions I should be asking but havent yet realized it  pli ul  pThanks for reading my long winded questionp

Negative 1307 pIve been looking at a few example programs in order to find better ways to code with Dart.p  pNot that this example below is of any particular importance, however it is taken from rosettacode dot org with alterations by me to hopefully bring it uptodate.p  pThe point of this posting is with regard to Benchmarks and what may be detrimental to results in Dart in some Benchmarks in terms of the speed of printing to the console compared to other languages. I dont know what the comparison is to other languages, however in Dart, the Console output at least in Windows appears to be quite slow even using StringBuffer.p  pAs an aside, in my test, if n1 is allowed to grow to 11, the total recursion count  238 million, and it takes on my laptop  c. 2.9 seconds to run Example 1.p  pIn addition, of possible interest, if the String assignment is altered to int, without printing, no time is recorded as elapsed Example 2.p  pTypical times on my lowspec laptop run from the Console  Windows.p  precodeElapsed Microseconds Print  26002 Elapsed Microseconds StringBuffer  9000 Elapsed Microseconds no Printing    3000 codepre  pObviously in this case, console print times are a significant factor relative to computation etc. times.p  pSo, can anyone advise how this compares to eg. Java times for console output That would at least be an indication as to whether Dart is particularly slow in this area, which may be relevant to some Benchmarks. Incidentally, times when running in the Dart Editor incur a negligible penalty for printing.p  precode Example 1.

Negative 1307 pSo I want to add properties to a model resembling the attributes of another model, that holds translatable fields.p  pMy modelsp  precodeclass MyModelmodels.Model     ... fields ...  class MyModelTranslationmodels.Model     ... the fields I want on MyModel ...     name  models.CharField     city  models.CharField     language  models.CharField     mymodel  models.ForeignKeyMyModel codepre  pSo I wrote following codeinitcodep  precodeclass MyModelmodels.Model      ...      def initself, args, kwargs         superModel, self.initargs, kwargs          gettranslation gets the object, that holds the translation fields for the          current active language         trans  lambda c c.gettranslation          setattrself.class, translation, propertytrans          fget  lambda c getattrtransc, name         fset  lambda c, v setattrtransc, name, v         setattrself.class, name, propertyfget, fset          fget  lambda c getattrtransc, city         fset  lambda c, v setattrtransc, city, v         setattrself.class, city, propertyfget, fset codepre  pThis works perfectly. When I then call codemymodel.namecode, I get the codemymodeltranslation.namecode for the active language. Setting this value is also possible.p  pSince I want to have this being made dynamically so I can use it in a mixin, I added it to a for loop, like sop  precode   def initself, args, kwargs         superModel, self.initargs, kwargs         trans  lambda c c.gettranslation         setattrself.class, translation, propertytrans           returns all fields of the translation model         transfields  [field.name for field in [             related for related in self.meta.getallrelatedobjects             if translation in related.name         ][0].model.meta.fields]           should then assign all those fields dynamically         for name in transfields             if not name  id and not name  mymodel                 fget  lambda c getattrtransc, name                 fset  lambda c, v setattrtransc, name, v                 setattrself.class, name, propertyfget, fset codepre  pSo I thought, okay, since the codenamecode value resembles the name of the field, that I used to add manually before, it should then add a codepropertycode with a name of the value of codenamecode on each run of the for loop. But it does not. When I call codemymodel.namecode it returns the model instance so basically codeselfcode. I have no clue, what is different, when I do it in a forloop instead of all manually.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 1307 pI hope Ive titled this question correctly, Ill try and explain what it is we are trying to achieve.p  pWe have built a white label web app using a template of files and directories.p  pWe are licensing this site to customers who can have their logo and custom colour styling via CSS on their version of the system. The site works exactly the same way for every customer.p  pEach sitecustomer has their own database and php configuration file to determine their database name and minor bits of information address, contact info etc.p  pWe have around 12 customers already but the problem we are finding is that we have to duplicate all our files and directories for each customer  making it very difficult when making small updates, we have to upload the new site 12 times.p  pTo add another spanner in the works we set each customer up with their own URL and direct them to our their directory using htaccess.p  pSo... Is there a way to use one version of the web app files and directories for all 12 customers, but if they go to www.customer1.com we can load in one configuration.php file and logocss and the same for www.customer2.com and so on p  pThey all use the same template files, but the URL determines which configuration file to load.p  pIm sorry if this is unclear, if it is Ill try and elaborate further.p  pThanksp

Negative 1307 pThis is a follow up question to my previous one, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18565057howtogetprotobufnetandprotostufftomutuallysupportinheritedclassesin18568619How to get protobufnet and protostuff to mutually support inherited classes in .Net and Javaa  p  pAs explained there, Im doing communications between an existing .Netbased program on a Windows system and a new program Im creating for Android devices.

Negative 1307 pIm performing a TFS Integration migration from tfs.visualstudio to an onpremise 2012 server.  Im running into a problem with a particular changeset that contains multiple binary files in excess of 1 MB, a few of which are 1516 MB.  [Im working remotely WAN with the onpremise TFS]p  pFrom the TFSI logs, Im seeing codeMicrosoft.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.Client.VersionControlException CTfsIPData42Foo.msi The request was aborted The request was canceled.  gt System.Net.WebException The request was aborted The request was canceled.  gt System.IO.IOException Cannot close stream until all bytes are written.codep  pDoing some Googling, Ive encountered others running into similar issues, not necessarily concerning TFS Integration.  Im confident this same issue would arise if I were just checking in a changeset like normal that met the same criteria.  As I understand it, when uploading files checking in, the default chunk size is 16MB and the timeout is 5 minutes.p  pMy internet upload speed is only 1Mbits at this site.  While I think the problem would mitigated with sufficient upload bandwidth, it wouldnt solve the problem.p  pUsing TCPView, Ive watched the connections to the TFS server from my client while the upload was in progress.  What I see is 9 simultaneous connections.  My bandwidth is thus getting shared among 9 file uploads.  Sure enough, after about 5 minutes the connections crap out before the upload byte counts can finish.p  pMy question is, how can I configure my TFS client to utilize fewer concurrent connections, andor smaller chunk sizes, andor increased timeouts  Can this be done globally somewhere to cover VS, TF.EXE, and TFS Integrationp

Negative 1307 pSo Ive got a codeListltTgtcode that I bind my codeComboBoxcode to through a codeBindingSourcecode. Works fine, no problem. Now I need to add one more item to my codeComboBoxcode that is not available in the List and I cant modify contents of the List either. The following schemes come to my mindp  ol liCreate a copy of the original List and add one more item to it before binding.li liCreate a UNION of two Lists the second one having only one item through LINQ and then let my BindingSource monitor the aggregate list.li liManually add items to the ComboBox and then monitor the List for changes.li ol  pNow I dont want to go for the 3rd option and lose binding advantages. The 1st option doesnt work because the newly created list is not linked to the original one and thus doesnt get updated. Combining two lists through LINQ would also create an independent List I guess.p  pSo what Im looking for here is what Id call an codeAggregateBindingSourcecode that would take one or more codeListltTgtcodes as its DataSource and update my ComboBox automatically.p  pOr does someone have a better ideap

Negative 1307 pI am working for a relatively small consultancy company, which delivers java enterprise web applications for big companies. In a recent meetup with the customer I developed some ideas on how to tailor our release process to their way of working.p  pFor each application platform they usually have a dev, test and production environment on which our applications are deployed. Additionally we have a local development environment, in which we do most of our development. p  pOur current approach is that we have 4 sets of configuration data, one for each environment. If we prepare a release for one of the environments, we exchange the configuration and use maven to generate the war file for deployment on a tomcat server. Furthermore, we use a git for version control.p  pI want to automate this process into one overall build process, but would appreciate some feedback  on which approach to takep  pstrongConfigurationstrongp  ul liShould the configuration integrated into the build as part of the war file or externalised and feed into the web application How could this be realised using mavenli liHow do you handle the difference of multiplatform configurations e.g. a flag based approach as part of the build process li ul  pstrongArtefact generationstrongp  ul liMy goal is to deliver an rpm for each environment instead of a war file, such that I can control the installation path and make the installation reversible.

Negative 1307 pIve been trying to read data from a device via Bluetooth 2.1 using an RN42. The device pairs to an iPhone or iPad Mini, and data is streamed across briefly, but the iOS amp BT module disconnect unpair within seconds less than 10. The device is outputting data 510kBs, so well within Bluetooths spec. Something that Ive also noticed is that when I run the function NSInputStream, [NSInputStream read maxLength], the number of bytes returned is always 158 or less. The app and hardware dont crash, but the Bluetooth just unpairs.p  pThe device is still sending data to the RN42 even after the disconnect, which reduces the likelihood of a problem on the electronics side. This setup also works perfectly fine on Android devices. I can stream data without any disconnects or crashes.p  pThings Ive tried...p  ul lifollowed the External Accessory example, EADemo, provided by Apple.li lipurely using the runloop instead of polling.  li liputting the stream on a background thread as suggested in this post. li liremoving all NSLogs to help with performance.li licompiled in debug and release modes.li ul  pOne thing which sort of works is slowing down the data transfer i.e. less than 5kBs, as that allows the iOS and BT module to stay connected and transfer data longer before disconnecting.p  precodedefine EADINPUTBUFFERSIZE 1024     Stream delegate    voidstreamNSStream aStream handleEventNSStreamEventeventCode      switch eventCode  [... other cases ...]          case NSStreamEventHasBytesAvailable                                  uint8t buf[EADINPUTBUFFERSIZE]             unsigned int len  0             len  [NSInputStream aStream readbuf maxLengthEADINPUTBUFFERSIZE]              iflen                   Read successful, process data              else                   Fail                               break                  default             break           Stream delegate with polling for better or worse       [...]         case NSStreamEventHasBytesAvailable                                  while [[session inputStream] hasBytesAvailable]                               Read the data                 NSInteger bytesRead  [[session inputStream] readbuf maxLengthEADINPUTBUFFERSIZE]                  if bytesRead gt 0                       Read successful, process data                   else if bytesRead  0                       End of buffer reached                     return                   else if bytesRead  1                       Failed to read                     return                                           break     [...] codepre

Negative 1307 pI have an app which I will call it the base app. The app works with many brands.  I need now to separate those brands, and to make a distinct app for every brand. Every app will have a slightly different design including different images and here and there maybe some specifictoabrand code. All of the apps should also use the same base code from the base app that deals with logic.p  pI have some options I have thought, but I am not sure if any of them suit my needs. Will be happy for clarifying the difference among the options.p  pThe options I have thought arep  p1 Creating an app for each one of the brands and just copypaste the class files from the base app as a reference, except the .xib files, which will be copied as a copy. The problem is that then I do not know how and where to write a brand specific code because it will be shared among others.p  p2 Creating a workspace that will include the projects for each one of the brand. Not sure how this works and if this is correct, will be glad for help clarifying here.p  p3 Nest a base app project inside every brands project. Any help clarifying what does it do will be appreciated.p  p3 Using the base app as a static library which will be linked in every brands project. Not sure what will happen with the UI shared, not shared. Will be glad for help clarifying here too.p  p4 Using a simple way of maintaining each one of the brands project, including the shared code which will be a disaster, I guess.p

Negative 1307 pI have a special use case where I have a series of input fields, and I switch from the current input field to the other based on the character typed. Its something like a keyword search where keywords are space separated or are enclosed in double quotes. So, as soon as I close a double quote around a word like India, it should become a keyword and the focus should move to the next input field.p  pNow, Im using a Mac with the US  International PC keyboard layout which allows me to type accented characters. For example,   e  .p  pWhat happens now, is if I type something like what and after the second quote, I hit space, the focus moves to the new input field perfectly, BUT, the new input field already has a  character prefilled in itp  pSome debugging showed that this keyboard layout causes two keyup events to be fired, one when you type  and the next when you type space. The event.keyCode for both these events jQuery is 229, and in the first case, event.shiftKey is true, and its false in the next. The same holds for when you type   e, the second event.keyCode is 229 again, which doesnt match .p  pThat helps me differentiate between the two events, but Im looking for a more concrete fix for this. As of now, Ive not been able to solve this.p  pIf anyone has any ideas, itll be great.p

Negative 1307 pAs described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18118749cameracapturetaskinwindowsphone8this threadsa first answer, for WP8 the Camera Capture Task automatically saves a copy of any images it creates to the Camera Roll. If an image is saved in this way, is it possible to strongprogrammaticallystrong surface the image in an application directly from the copy in the Camera Roll without creating a second copy in a location such as Isolated Storage or Application Data If so, how would you get a pointer to the Camera Roll location of this newlysaved image p  pId like to avoid having multiple redundant copies of each image floating around, if at all possible. And if using the copy in the Camera Roll will allow me to leverage the CameraCaptureTask functionality instead of working with the Camera API directly, then this would be ideal for my purposes.

Negative 1307 pIm having a problem with the code Im writing. p  pIm writing an iOS program Im an iOS rookie which basically requires me to use quick look framework to view some documents on the iPhone .doc, .ppt, .pdf etc.. which are stored in the database Core Data  SQLite, nothing external. I need to add the files somehow, but since iOS isnt really allowing me to browse through its file system I cant find and save the documents i need in database. Which kinda blocks everything else i need to do until I can get those documents from the database. to set up table views that list the files and the details about the files etc.p  pThis is for a class project so it doesnt need to be perfect condition, I just need to be able to browse through a few documents while Im presenting the project. I can add all the documents Im going to use at one time while Im coding and I wont need to be able to add any new files when Im using the program during the presentation. And I dont want it to make it more complicated if i dont have to. Like connecting to an external database with the files already saved in and use a php bufferpage to connect to that database or anything like that. I dont have the necessary server system to execute that php file. I want this operation to be done inside the phone. p  pThe solutions I was able to think of so far p  ul liGrab some random office files from the internet and save them into the database. Then use them later.li liCreate image scans of some office files and cheat by using the scanned image instead of actual documents.li ul  pI would really appreciate it if someone can tell me another and much easier way to handle this. Please just keep in mind that while I have a programming background with Java and C, Im still an iOS rookie and just barely moving on from scratching the surface. So it is likely that I dont know about something iOS provides by default and Im just pulling my hair out for nothing.  p  pI think thats it, I hope I didnt forget anything. If you need more details Im going to be here and I can provide them almost instantly. Thanks everyone in advance for your help. p

Negative 1307 pAfter spending a lot of time reading and thinking, I think I have finally grasped what monads are, how they work, and what theyre useful for. My main goal was to figure out if monads were something I could apply to my daily work in C.p  pWhen I started learning about monads, I got the impression that they are magical, and that they somehow make IO and other nonpure functions pure.p  pI understand the importance of monads for things like LINQ in .Net, and Maybe is very useful for dealing with functions that dont return valid values. And I also appreciate the need to limit statefulness in code and to isolate external dependencies, and I was hoping monads would help with those too.p  pBut Ive finally come to the conclusion that monads for IO and handling state are a necessity for Haskell, because Haskell has no other way to do it otherwise, you couldnt guarantee sequencing, and some calls would be optimized away. But for more mainstream languages, monads are not a good fit for these needs, since most languages already handle and state and IO easily.p  pSo, my question is, is it fair to say that the IO monad is really only useful in Haskell Is there a good reason to implement an IO monad in, say, Cp

Negative 1307 pSo, just getting started in Angular and its pretty tricky, coming from a pretty simple JS and jQuery background.  Heres what Im trying to do.  I have a tag template that has a couple categories and then some subtags contained within.  I have defined these as an object, with the idea that the objectfile can be called via file request and manipulated, etc.p  pI have loaded labels and tag category inputs dynamically by using a factory service and a controller with ngrepeat.  Likewise, I have deposited the subtags into another div on page2 using jQuery mobile page swiping.  Id like to use the checkbox state of the category tags to showhide the subtags on page2.  p  pI have tried dozens of things and searched all over stackexchange, the net, etc, but is simple and straightforward and similar enough for me to get it working.  If someone can point me in the right direction, that would be great.  Keep in mind that my next step is to add a button on page 1 to add a new category, and buttons on page 2 to add subtags to the subtag categories.p  pFinally, I have one more weird thing to report.  If I only have two pages in my DOM, I have some weird behavior when loading the page.  If I load from page 1, the tag checkboxes do not function, and I see a slight fattening of the border of the labels.  If I swipe left to page 2 and reload from this page, the borders of the labels are thin and the checkboxes function.  Cannot track down why this would be happening.  My hacky workaround is to add an empty page zero and then changepage immediately to page one, but this is far from ideal.  Any thoughts on that would be appreciated as well.p  pHere it isp  pHTMLp  blockquote   p                      p blockquote  precode   lt Angular version    gt              ltbutton classuibtn

Negative 1307 pI have a large multitabbed HTML form where the user can enter lots of data through input typetext, selection, and checkboxes and the data is store in a mysql data base via php. With the checkboxes user are able to check multiple boxes per field. After the form is submitted i need to allow the user to reopen a specific form at a later time and edit that data. p  pI have so far been able to populate the text and selection fields by doing a Query on that specific form ID and using php variables to fill in the value of the text field or using if statements to select the correct option within my selection boxes. I am stuck though on the checkboxes. I am storing my checkbox data by imploding it and saving each field in a single column within my table i know this isnt best practice but i have no need to query the specif c of these checkboxes just to display all the data when needed Is the best way to go about this to just run through each check box from a specific field explode the data check each part of the array to see if it matches and then set checkedchecked if it does This seems like a massive amount of work because of the number of checkboxes i have.p  pJust wanted to see if I am on the right track before i spend to much more time on this.

Negative 1307 pAm I right in thinking it is fine to treat a pointer as an int for the purposes of sorting an array of pointers, e.g.p  precodeqsortptrs, n, sizeofvoid, intcmp codepre  pI want to sort the ptrs to ascertain whether there are any duplicates, irrespective of the type of thing the pointer is pointing to, so the qsort is a precursor to doing that.p  pmy codeintcmpcode is pretty standard, e.g.p  precodeint intcmpconst void a, const void b      const int ia  const int a  casting pointer types     const int ib  const int b       integer comparison returns negative if b gt a     and positive if a gt b      return ia   ib  codepre  pit seems to work in my unittests but is there some reason why considering a ptr as an int may cause problems for such a scenario that i may have overlookedp

Negative 1307 pSo what Im trying to do with this program is take two arrays, and then merge them into a third array. The main method takes the data from a specified file and then creates arrays for each line, and there are only two lines.

Negative 1307 pIm writing a program, in Java, to simulate a molecular algorithm.  As the molecular algorithm inherently uses concurrency you can have as many chemical reactions going as needed, as long as you have the chemicals and concentrations to supply them, it requires me to use concurrency.  p  pHowever, I recently found out that the package I was using for my graph structures is not threadsafe.  I have an ArrayList of graphs set up for each thread.  During computation, a thread modifies its own ArrayList and some of the graphs within it, but I have no code allowing one thread to modify the ArrayList or graphs of any other thread, until it recieves the two ArrayLists from its child threads.  p  pTo accomplish this, Im using ForkJoinPool My understanding of this is, and please correct me if Im wrong, is that it divides the task up among two threads which divide the task up among two threads... When the calculations are done in the leaf threads, they return up to their parent thread, and so on, until the roots children return up to it, and the root, if ForkJoinTask, returns the result.  p  pNeedless to say, the notable exception to what I want happening is worksteeling.  My question, therefore is, if, with the exceptions of worksteeling and a child thread returning to a parent thread, if no threads interact with any other threads, can a nonthreadsafe object be used in a concurrent applicationp

I ended building a work around using notifications and a serial dispatch queue, but I think it can be improved. p  pHeres how Im saving the pictures and then repopulating the UICollectionViewp  pI built a method to call when I need to enumerate the photo album viewDidLoad and once Ive received a ALAssetsLibraryChangedNotification.p  precodevoidsetupCollectionView      assets  [[] mutableCopy]     block NSMutableArray tmpAssets  [[] mutableCopy]       This grabs a static instance of the ALAssetsLibrary     ALAssetsLibrary assetsLibrary  [ProfileViewController defaultAssetsLibrary]           Enumerate through all of the ALAssets photos in the users Asset Groups Folders     [assetsLibrary enumerateGroupsWithTypesALAssetsGroupAll usingBlockALAssetsGroup group, BOOL stop          if [[group valueForPropertyALAssetsGroupPropertyName] isEqualToStringalbumName]               Make sure we have the group... this may be redundant              if group  nil                 return                            I read in some SO posts that setting the filter might help, but I dont think it does             NSLogRefresh pictures  d,[group numberOfAssets]             [group setAssetsFilter[ALAssetsFilter allPhotos]]this will cause group to reload             if groupnil                  [group enumerateAssetsUsingBlockALAsset result, NSUInteger index, BOOL stop                      ifresult                         [tmpAssets addObjectresult]                     else                         stop  YES                                      ]                           self.assets  tmpAssets               Reload the UICollectionView             dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,                  [self.collectionView reloadData]                 [self.collectionView.collectionViewLayout invalidateLayout]                            failureBlockNSError error          NSLogError loading images , error     ]  codepre  pInitially this seemed to be working just fine, but occasionally, when calling this after writing an image to the custom photo album, the photo that was just taken would not appear in the collection view. The photo would be saved to the library it shows up in the Photos app and after exiting and rerunning the app the photo would appear, but the enumeration would not include that latest photo. p  pAs suggested by a few Stack Overflow posts on the matter, I tried implementing ALAssets notifications by listening for ALAssetsLibraryChangedNotification, but Ive had some issues with that. Heres what Im doing once I receive a notificationp  precode void handleAssetChangedNotifiationNSNotification notification      NSDictionary userInfo  notification.userInfo     NSSet updateAssets  userInfo[ALAssetLibraryUpdatedAssetsKey]     if updateAssets.countgt0                  dispatchsyncphotoLoadQueue,              [self setupCollectionView]                codepre  pThis seems fine to me. Im checking to see if theres any data in the ALAssetLibraryUpdatedAssetsKey and then throwing it on the dispatch queue, which Im started using once I discovered I was receiving several notifications for saving a single photo.

Negative 1307 pMy team has a lot of IOC conventions that look something like...p  precodeif type.Namespace  My.Fun.Namespace       do stuff  codepre  pOf course, maintaining this kind of thing becomes brutal after awhile, and we would rather not. The only option I could think of was to store these all in one place, as string constants or something of that nature, but that isnt a lot better... We have been considering making classes that basically serve as namespace identifiers in order to have almost an anchor type to key off of, like, say...p  precodeif type.Namespace  typeofMy.Fun.Namespace.MarkerClass.Namespace       do stuff  codepre  pBut that just feels weird. So is there another way to solve this one that we just dont know about If not, has anyone had any luck with the whole marker class conceptp  pResponse to commentsp  pI didnt architect this and it isnt up to me to change it Im just hoping someone knows a better way to get a namespace. What I have outlined above is actually a snippet of code from inside one of the StructureMap conventions were using. The convention scans an assembly for implementations of a given interface and, generally, gives preference to more specialized implementationshence one found in X.Y.Z namespace is to be preferred over the base implementation found in X.Y.p

Now given this, it would mean that there would not be multiple copies of B in C, as the instantiation would be cascaded down to the level it is needed. I am not sure how to word my explanation but say B has a function called print which prints i am B and C overrides this function put prints i am C. If you called print on C without virtual you end up printing i am B, using virtual would mean that it would print i am C.p  pcodeiiicode My idea here is that Java can use interfaces to avoid the use of multiple inheritance. You can implement multiple interfaces but you can only extend one Class. Im not sure what else to add here, so any input or relevant resources would be helpful.p

Negative 1307 pAre there any best practices or ways we can use to version a collection or objects in a collection in Mongo DBp  pThe requirement of versioning a collection is because, the objects in the collection maybe added with new attributes going forward but the already added objects i.e. old objects will not be having these attributes and the values for these new attributes. So on retrieval, we need to make sure, the code is not broken in deserializing the different versions of the same object in the collection.p  pI can think of adding a version attribute to the objects explicitly, but are there any better built in alternatives in Mongo DB for handling this versioning of objects andor collections.p  pThanks, Bathiya   p

Negative 1307 pSince a hrefhttpscode.google.compchromiumissuesdetailid386073 relnofollowthis Chrome issuea resulted in jPlayer 1.6.0 using the Flash solution for mp3 playback in Chrome 36, Ive discovered my mp3s wont play via the Flash plugin. The mp3s play fine via the HTML5 solution in Firefox 30 and IE 11.p  pNote Im not interested in fixing playback to use HTML 5 instead of Chrome  the newest version of jPlayer does that. Instead, I want to understand why playback via Flash is not working.p  pThe mp3s are hosted on archive.org.p  pWhat I observe when I start playing is that in the Chrome Network inspector, I get one request for the mp3 URL with Status Finished, and then another request for the same URL that sits in Status pending forever. p  pWhat I see in Firefox from the HTML5 solution is two requests to the mp3 URL that both receive 302 redirects, and then a long running request to the actual mp3 URL which successfully streams the mp3 for playbackp  pjPlayer inspector shows the progress and timeupdate metrics twitching between 3 and 4, and loadstart, play and waiting having all occurred but sit at 0.p  pSo I think the Flash player isnt handling the redirect probably. But Im unsure of how to go about troubleshooting this issue.p  pIve created a JSFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nete4WnF4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nete4WnF4a to demonstrate the issue.p  pIve attempted to use Wireshark to work out what is going on. Whilst with Firefox using the HTML 5 player I see the GET request that results in a 302, I see no sign of this GET request under Chrome.p  pIve worked around the issue by moving to jPlayer 1.6.4, but this doesnt change the fact that my mp3s will not work in browsers without HTML 5 audio support.p  precodeThanks codepre

Negative 1307 pSo I have a Partial view that loads in with p  precodeHtml.Partialpartial, Model, new ViewDataDictionary   DisplayCheckbox, true   codepre  pWithin that codepartialcode page is a loop that looks like thisp  precodeforeach var w in Model.WeekEndingDateRange      ltthgtw.WeekEndingDate.FormatDateltthgt  codepre  pwhich creates table headers for a jquery tinytable that is later populated with data in my view.p  pThe problem Im having is that the codeModel.WeekEndingDateRangecode can change. When the user presses a button to filter results shown on the table, it makes an ajax call to my controller that looks like thisp  precodefunction filterResults     do some stuff like creating model      .ajax         type POST,         url Url.ActionFilterTable, Report,         data model          .donefunction data          continue on to populate table data codepre  pSo when the ajax call finishes I can make a call likep  precodedata.WeekEndingDateRange codepre  pto grab the list which I want the partial to loop through. This will create size of the codedata.WeekEndingDateRangecode list amount of headers for the table. p  pTherefore I need a way for the partial to strongnotstrong grab strongModel.WeekEndingDateRangestrong but instead to grab strongdata.WeekEndingDateRangestrong. This way, before the table is filtered, the partial will create no headers because no information is populated in the table and as soon as the user filters their results, the table will create a new header for each element in strongdata.WeekEndingDateRangestrong. p  pIve already tried doingp  precodeHtml.PartialProjectAllocationReport, data, new ViewDataDictionary   DisplayCheckbox, true   codepre  pafter my ajax call, but this wont work because data is out of scope.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 1307 pSo I hope this isnt a duplicate, however I either havent been able to find the adequate solution or I just am not 100 on what Im looking for. Ive written a program to thread lots of requests. I create a thread to p  ol liFetch responses from a number of apis such as this share.yandex.rugpp.xmlurlMYURL as well as scraping blogs li liParse the responses of all requests from the example above json using pythongoose to extract articlesli liReturn the parsed results back to the primary thread and insert into a database. li ol  pIts all been going well until it needs to pull back larger amounts of data which i havent tested before. The primary reason for this is that it takes me over my shared memory limit on a shared Linux server 512mb initiating a kill.

Negative 1307 pI have an application that uses RabbitMQ as the message queue to sendreceive message between two components sender and receiver. The sender sends message in a very fast way. The receiver receives the message and then does some very timeconsuming task mainly database writing for very large data size. Since the receiver takes a very long time to finish the task and then retrieve the next message in the queue, the sender will keep filling up the queue quickly. So my question is Will this cause the message queue to overflow p  pThe message consumer looks like the followingp  precodepublic void onMessage throws IOException, InterruptedException      channel.exchangeDeclareEXCHANGENAME, fanout     String queueName  channel.queueDeclareallDataCase, true, false, false, null.getQueue     channel.queueBindqueueName, EXCHANGENAME,       QueueingConsumer consumer  new QueueingConsumerchannel     channel.basicConsumequeueName, true, consumer      while true          QueueingConsumer.Delivery delivery  consumer.nextDelivery         String message  new Stringdelivery.getBody         System.out.println [x] Received   message            JSONObject json  new JSONObjectmessage         String caseID  json.getStringcaseID         following takes very long time                     dao.saveToDBcaseID       codepre  pEach message received by the consumer contains a caseID. For each caseID, it will save large amount of data to the database, which takes very long time. Currently only one consumer is set up for the RabbitMQ since producerconsumer use the same queue for the publishsubscribe of caseID. So how can I speed up the consumer throughput so that the consumer can catch up with the producer and avoid the message overflow in the queue Should I use multithreading in the consumer part to speed up the consumption rate Or should I use multiple consumers to consume the incoming message simutaneously Or is there any asynchronous way to let the consumer consume the message asynchronously without waiting it to finish Any suggestions are welcome. p

Negative 1307 pI am new to android expansion files. I am not sure how it works or what to do stepbystep build an expansion file. As far I been reading, if I am not wrong please correct me expansion files can be files that are stored in the Asset folder or Res folder. What I dont understand is if my app is depended on files that are stored in both folders and I take them out wouldnt that cause an error build How does expansion really work Furthermore, If I successfully create an expansion file from res folder example would the expansion file store it in the res folder in the phone or I have to change all my code that makes reference to the resdrawable folder to the appropriate location If so, then what is the correct path that I need to change my code intop  pMy app is so far like 600mb and continue to grow. Within my app, the core dependance is a database stored locally in the asset folder and some images in the resdrawable folder. There are some images that are not dependance on the app directly which makes the remaining 550mb. Nevertheless, those images are needed because the database makes reference to those images just the name then I populate an imageview with reference from the database. I was thinking to store all those images into an expansion file but I was not sure if those images will be store within the resdrawable folder in my phone or it will be store in a different folder if so, would that cause an errorp
Negative 1307 pI want my codeUITableViewcode to only be as tall as it needs to be, as it floats above the main codeUIViewControllercodes codeviewcode. If I hardcode a height of 200 and theres only one cell in the table, it looks silly.p  pIm aware in my view controller I could monitor the table view and define the height of it based on the number of cells it has, but the height is a property of the view, and for MVC it doesnt make much sense for the controller to be actively managing a views height.p  pIs it possible to have a codeUITableViewcode subclass, and have it define an intrinsic height based on the number of cells it holds So with Auto Layout I could add the subclass to my view, specify its width, center it vertically, and perhaps define a less than or equal height constraint saying to keep it smaller than 200pts.  But for the most part have the intrinsic content size of the view define the height of the view automaticallyp  pThis would be just like a codeUILabelcode being able to be centered horizontally and vertically with some distance from the left and right, and have it grow and shrink vertically automatically.p  pCould I feasibly do this with a codeUITableViewcode subclassp

Now, this is very very memory heavy as I understand it has to recreate the underlying data structures again and it does not seem to be cleaning up the old objects.  I tried something like p  precodeold  mydata  mydata  mydata.append... del old codepre  pwhich did not make any difference at allp  pThe problem is that my process works on a host with only 1GB of memory and this kind of processing exhausts the host memory rather quickly. p  pI need the to keep at least the last 30ish hours worth of data in memory as analytics are performed every 200msevery tick. p  pAny suggestions to optimize memory  and still keep the pandas.TimeSeries functionality slicing based on time intervals. p

As you can see there are only 3 labels at the moment and they are not whole numbers.p  pThe way I bind my data to the graph is like sop  precode        Create total seconds of work out         ArrayList time  new ArrayList          for int i  0 i lt list1.Count i Each element means a second          Create time list             int seconds  i  60 Get seconds             int minutes  i  60  60 Get minutes             int hours  i  3600  Get hours              time.Addhours.ToString    minutes.ToString  .                             seconds.ToString Add hours, minutes and seconds to graph                   dataChart.Series[list1].Points.DataBindXYtime,list1         dataChart.Series[list2].Points.DataBindXYtime, list2         dataChart.Series[list3].Points.DataBindXYtime, list3         dataChart.Series[list4].Points.DataBindXYtime, list4         dataChart.Series[list5].Points.DataBindXYtime, list5 codepre  pIs this the easiestmost efficient way of plotting data to a graph Should I be doing it a different way p  pI tried only adding to the time array when the number of seconds is a multiple of 10 which would result in even whole numbers but I need to have an equal number of elements in the time array list and the other array lists. I have the duration if the session in as well only this is in DateTime format so maybe there is a way of simply telling the chart what the maximum and minimum values are and allow it to create the axis labels itselfp

Negative 1307 pIve been importing a lot of tab delimited text files from an external system.  Each time I download a file from the system the zip file contains the tab delimited text file or data and a schema that describes the data.  Only the tab delimited data is stored into my Hadoop instance and I ignore the schema file this might be an error on my part but I didnt want to store the same old schema millions of time over.  I made the assumption that the schema would not change but since then I have seen a couple schema changes every so often.  What Ive done to handle these schema changes is updated my parse method to try and read the data using all of the known schemas that I am aware of and which ever one reads without errors wins.  Am I doing this all wrong or does someone have a better way of doing this  Is there a product or concept that I can use to help me with thisp

Negative 1307 pIm trying to figure out how to automate a process on a work server with an S3 sync of images and then invalidate the CloudFront distribution that points to the bucket with the images. I have some images in the S3 that I uploaded manually and have created the CloudFront distribution, which is working.

Please note I do strongNOTstrong want to rotate the image, just it to be loaded clockwise. Also this is not an actual pie chart, just an image of the pie chart. Hence I have not used SVG.

Negative 1307 pDDD exposes bounded contexts, domain models, aggregates... but I often miss the keypoint of business rules. I would like to know how business rules integrate into this approach. Here is an example p  pImagine you have 2 bounded contexts in a credit company. One for debt recovery, the other for early refunds. These contexts embed real business specificities. In a conceptual point of view, I think these bounded contexts should separately embed common model parts, and similar domain model entities graph of 3 or 4 accountancy entities. Even if their respective models embed a common submodel we do not plan it can change, business rules that apply to these submodels are different. A DebtRecoveryService ensures rules are correctly applied, and another EarlyFundsService does the same, with specific accountancy rules. p  ul liShould this submodel be embedded and served to others by another dedicated bounded context if different business rules apply to them in terms of maths and respective behaviours .li liWhat defines an aggregate, is it only a part of a model li liDo specific business rules define specific aggregates  li ul  pemDo you think an aggregate should be considered only for the entity graph it represents, and be reused by other bounded contexts.

So if you use the only queue you will process 10 messages from A then 1 message from B. p  pBut what if you want to balance load and process one message from A then one message from B etc. Consuming from multiple queues is not a good option because we cant use wildcard binding in this case.p  pstrongUpdatestrongbr Queue per producer seems as the best approach. Producers dont know their speed which changes constantly. Having one queue per consumer I can subscribe to one topic and receive messages from all publishers available. But having a queue per producer I need to code the logic by myselfp  ol liGet all available queues through management plugin AMQP doesnt allow to list queues.li liFilter by queue name.li liImplement round robin strategy.li liImplement notification mechanism to subscribe to new publishers that can appear at any moment.li liRemove unnecessary queue when publisher had disappeared and client read all messages.li ol  pWell, it seems pretty easy but I thought that broker could provide all of this functionality without any coding. In case with one queue I just create one persistent queue, bind it to a topic exchange then start any number of publishers that send messages to the topic. This option works almost out of the box.p

Because my clients have very little computer knowledge the installation and update need to be as easy as possible. I want the installation to be the only manual step, updates should be done automatically.p  pInstallation will be done via Installshield or more likely by one of its open source clones. The installer will install these componentsp  ul lia Java runtime Oracle JRE as a kind of portable app that means by simply copying the contained files and not using the provided installerli liApache Commons Daemon to install my application as a Windows serviceli lithe application itself in the shape of several JARs created with Spring Bootli ul  pWhen one of those components changes I want to update them automatically and as silently as possible. The application will be able to determine if updates are available on the web and download them.p  pWhat options do I have to achieve this  Java Webstart is in my eyes not a good solution  for example it does not enable me to update the runtime. Providing an update installer will need user interaction and perhaps even administrative rights so it wil not run silently.p  pThe proposed link below does not fit my problem because I use a daemon which needs to be updated during runtime and neither of the given solutions in the linked post supports that.p

Negative 1307 pIn Java, I have an codeabstract class Playercode and the two classes codeStrikercode and codeDefendercode they both extend the codeabstract class Playercode.

I can create defenders, who can tackle somebody only with a given intensity.p  pWhat I want is to be able to create strikersresp. defenders who can do different tasksand not only shoot to a given distance. For example Id like to  have a striker who can shoot a penalty, a striker who can play with its head etc.p  pHow can I do that Do I need necessarily to create more classes for the strikersI mean a class for the strikers who shoot penalties, a class for the striker who play with head.

Negative 1307 pI need to extract two blocks of text from several files and put them in separate lists using python. The first block starts from line 30, and isnt too hard to extract.

For examplep  precodeprjfiles  [   line,   line,   etc ]  prjfiles2  [   line,   etc ] codepre  pSo I need to take all the lines between [] in the first block and put it in one list, and take the lines between [] in the second block and put it in another list. As of right now, I usep  precodefor i, line in enumerateprj   if i gt 29  codepre  pto start on a specific line, and then it uses a regular expression to find ] where it breaks the for loop and records the line it ends on in cnt. Then I use another for loop to start at cnt  2 to extract the second block. While I think this works, I feel like its super inefficient since Im basically doing the same thing twice. Is there an obvious better method that Im missingp  pEDIT So instead of parsing the file, I tried to use codeimportcode instead. I do think its much simpler, but since Im looping through some files to find all the files, I have a general variable that represents the file name. This means when I try to use the variable to import the file, I get the module doesnt exist error. So for example, my variable name is codepyfilecode, and codeimportcode is reading it as codepyfilecode instead of the actual path value. Is there a way to get around thisp

Negative 1307 pLets say we have a set of widgets each with their own input label. How do we create a reactive object whose value is the character that represents the input ID of the last widget that was modified p  pFor example, if we havep  pstrongui.Rstrongp  precodeshinyUIfluidPage    textInputtxta, Input Text A,    textInputtxtb, Input Text B  codepre  pstrongserver.Rstrongp  precodeshinyServerfunctioninput, output     lastupdatedwidget lt reactive       hypothetical code that indicates ID value of last updated widget      codepre  pThe desired result is as follows. If the user modifies the first text box, then the value of codelastupdatedwidgetcode would be codetxtacode. If they modify the second box, the value of codelastupdatedwidgetcode becomes codetxtbcode. Im in search of a result that extends to the obvious generalization of setting the value to be the ID of any of the widgets that was adjusted last. p  pId like this to work for an arbitrary number of widget inputs, including the case that they were generated by a coderenderUIcode statement. So making a separate codereactivecode statement for each widget isnt an option. However, if the reactive statement requires a loop over all the widget names or something like that I can certainly work with that. And multiple reactive statements is okay, as long as its a fixed amount, and not a function of the number of widgets.p  pIt seems like a pretty simple problem, so I was surprised when it became a roadblock for me. I feel like the solution would be really obvious and Im just not seeing, so if it is, I apologize for making it a new question. But any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1307 pMy implementation executes 3 OpenCL kernels p  pKernelA, KernelB and KernelCp  pThey all operate on the same data and kernel C depends on the Data, produced by A and B. p  pFor evalutation, I executed A and B first, and then Kernel C multiple times on the same input data. p  pWhat I noticed  When I execute C repeadedly, it is very fast.  It is like 3 times faster on the same data. 15ms vs 45 ms p  pIt is very interesting, as I cant explain this behaviour.  There are no RAMGPU memory transfers or anything. Only global, constant and private memory are used. The data is very big Global workgroup size is 640x480 and local workgroup size is 32x2 best result of brute force evaluation.p  pMy GPUs are a Nvidia Quadro NVS 4200 and a Qualcom Adreno 430.p  pI cant explain this because of data caching, since the there is such a huge amount of workgroups executed on differen data. I also execute clflush after each computation. So why is there such a huge performance differencep

Why How can I get venue codegardencode without query  I tried intent as codeintentBrowsecode. But in this case, I can see my codegardencode if I put radius as 100 meters. If more, I see venues with distances from farther to nearest and my codegardencode misses that list because it is too near to me.

Negative 1307 pWeve just upgraded to CF10, and Im finishing up a library of missing utility functions mostly iterationrelated, like codemapcode and codereducecode. These functions should always be available on every page and in every component in the application. They are methods of a stateless component thats basically acting as a module or namespace.p  pI have taken after Underscore and its ilk by referring to the component as codecode. So, usage looks like code.mapmyArray, myCallbackcode. My question is where I should put the codecode variable. I can start every page with codevariables.  new Shared.Components.Util.FunctionalUtilcode, but thats annoying and were going to end up with a lot of useless copies. Id like to have it declared globally and initialized no more than once per request.p  pColdFusions global scopes are CGI, URL, Form, Cookie, Client. These are the scopes used for name resolution that share their values across a request. Of these, the CGI, URL, and Form scopes run the risk of collision and the Cookie scope actually stores data on the client this leaves Client. However, components cannot be stored in Client scope. In fact, the only ones that seem to work are URL and Form, and Form doesnt always exist.p  pNow, stuffing a utility component into URL kind of seems like a questionable thing to do. Is there a saner alternativep
