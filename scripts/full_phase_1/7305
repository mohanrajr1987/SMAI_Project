The kind of emofficialem one is  codeyyyymmddcode but for easier keyboard direct input I was told to support codeyyyymmddcode format too.p  pThe server expects codeyyyymmddcode so I convert codeyyyymmddcode into codeyyyymmddcode if possible I am just keeping in simple here in this example. p  precodemypicker.datepicker         dateFormat yymmdd,         .onchange, function           Attempt to correct only 8 digits format. When pasting or typing         if dddddddd.testthis.value              this.value  this.value.substring0,4    this.value.substring4,6    this.value.substring6,8               codepre  pThis works fine in various browsers except in IE. As soon as I select a date in the picker the picker hides but it reappears again. Does this look like a jqueryui bug IE bug My bug Can I do it in another way so the datepicker stops reappearingp

Positive 7305 pIm using the Bootstrap Date Range Picker a hrefhttpwww.daterangepicker.com relnofollowhttpwww.daterangepicker.coma.  Overall the plugin works great, however I do have one question that im hoping to find the answer to.p  pThe input field that contains the date range picker sits within a bootstrap dropdown.  Therefore, the user has to click the dropdown to view the date range picker.p  pWhen the user clicks into the input field to select the date, the date range picker appears.  However, it doesnt generate the HTML that shows the picker within the dropdown DIV like I want it to.  It generates the HTML at the bottom of the page.  Id like to strongmove this generated HTML to the dropdown DIVstrong.p  pIn can view the generated HTML within the daterangepicker.js, but im not sure if this could be changed.p  pThanks for the helpp  pAdamp

The dates of October, although booked dont get to be marked in red.  There are 2 code snippets similar, but one is to fetch the dates booked done via ajax upon page loading, and then another which responds to a button in order to Add dates to be bookedp  pIn the code here, the myDate is supposed to be the running dates of the Datepicker being sent to the beforeshowday function, but it seems it only sends those of September, so the rest does not get to be compared with my baddates, that is, booked days returned in data.p  pYes, the documentation on beforeshowday saysp  pThe function is called for each day in the datepicker before it is displayed. So the function will be called only for the days to be displayed.p  pIndeed, I can imagine that jquery automatically can see what month is being displayed and then sends all of the days of that month to be compared against the json array of booked dates. Being this so, why is not sending October when I open that calendar monthp  pThere is some superfluous snippet in the code as bookedperiods is a route for a controller that does not have the method since I noticed it was unnnecesary. p  pThis can be seen live here p  pa hrefhttpchefvillas.comdetailsproperty36 relnofollowhttpchefvillas.comdetailsproperty36ap  precodeltscriptgt               jQuerydocument.readyfunction       function       var startdate  startdate.val     var owner 36     var user  24     var enddate  enddate.val     url  URLroutebookedperiods      .posturl,        arrival startdate,       departure enddate,       userid owner,       bookedby user     , function hola data        test.textdata          myBadDates  data            startdate, enddate.datepicker       dateFormat dd MM yy,       numberOfMonths 2,       beforeShowDay checkBadDates             function checkBadDatesmydate var returntrue var returnclass available checkdate  .datepicker.formatDatedd MM yy, mydate forvar i  0 i lt myBadDates.length i               ifmyBadDates[i]  checkdate                    return  false         returnclass unavailable               return [return,returnclass]       botoncalendario.clickfunction      var startdate  startdate.val     var owner 36     var user  24     var enddate  enddate.val     url  URLroutereservations      .posturl,        arrival startdate,       departure enddate,       userid owner,       bookedby user     , function hola data        test.textdata                 ltscriptgt codepre

Positive 7305 pI have a DatePickerDialog that launches successfully in a fragment. When an orientation change occurs the app crashes. The logcat output says the NPE happens with onDismiss in the DatePickerFragment. The onDismiss code is used to toggle the soft keyboard to show again after the launch of the DatePickerDialog toggles it off.  The InputMethodManager to launch the soft keyboard uses getActivity reference which I think is causing the crash after orientation since the Activity is recreated.  Can I replace that with a reference to the Fragment using findFragmentByTag as a way to reuse the dialogfragment upon orientation changep  pHere is partial DatePickerFragement filep  precodepublic class DatePickerFragment extends DialogFragment implements DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener   public DatePickerFragment    Override public Dialog onCreateDialogBundle savedInstanceState  ...

Negative 7305 pive noticed that plenty of games  applications very common on mobile builds pack numerous images into an image strip.  I figured that the advantages in this are making the program more tidy file system  wise and reducing uninstallation time. During the runtime of the application, the entire image strip is allocated and copied from FS to RAM. On the contrary, images can be stored in an image archive and unpacked during runtime to a number of image structures in RAM.p  pThe way I see it, the image strip approach is less efficient because of worse caching performance and because that even if the optimal rectangle packing algorithm is used, there will be empty spaces between the stored images in the strip, causing a waste of RAM.p  pWhat are the advantages in using an image strip over using an image archive filep

Negative 7305 pI am working on a Silverlight client and associated ASP.NET web services not WCF, and I need to implement some features containing user preferences such as a favourite items system and whether theyd like wordwrapping or not. In order to make a pleasant rather than infuriating user experience, I want to persist these settings across sessions. A brief investigation suggests that there are two main possibilities.p  ol liSilverlight isolated storageli liASP.NETaccessible databaseli ol  pI realise that option 2 is probably the best option as it ensures that even if a user disables isolated storage for Silverlight, their preferences still persist, but I would like to avoid the burden of maintaining a database at this time, and I like the idea that the preferences are available for loading and editing even when server connectivity is unavailable. However, I am open to reasoned arguments why it might be preferrable to take this hit now rather than later.p  pWhat I am looking for is suggestions on the best way to implement settings persistence, in either scenario. For example, if isolated storage is used, should I use an XML format, or some other file layout for persisting the settings if the database approach is used, do I have to design a settings table or is there a builtin mechanism in ASP.NET to support this, and how do I serve the preferences to the clientp  pSop  pWhich solution is the better solution for user preference persistence How might settings be persisted in that solution, and how might the client access and update themp  h3Prior Researchh3  pNote that I have conducted a little prior research on the matter and found the following links, which seem to advocate either solution depending on which article you read.p  ul lia hrefhttpwww.ddj.comwindows208300036httpwww.ddj.comwindows208300036ali lia hrefhttptinesware.blogspot.com200812persistingusersettingsinsilverlight.htmlhttptinesware.blogspot.com200812persistingusersettingsinsilverlight.htmlali ul  h3Updateh3  pIt turns out that Microsoft have provided settings persistence in isolated storage as a builtin part of Silverlight I somehow missed it until after implementing an alternative. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions826613persistinguserpreferencesinsilverlight832332832332My answer belowa has more details on this. p  pIm keeping the question open as even though Microsoft provides clientside settings persistence, it doesnt necessarily mean this is the best approach for persisting user preferences and Id like to canvas more opinions and suggestions on this.p

Negative 7305 pI am writing a Java multithreaded network application and having real difficulty coming up with a way to unit test the object which sends and receives communication from network clients.p  pThe object sends out a message to a number of clients and then waits for responses from the clients.p  pAs each client responds, a dashboardstyle GUI is updated. p  pstrongemIn more detail...emstrongp  pA Message object represents a text message to be sent and contains an array of Clients which should receive the message.p  pThe Message object is responsible for dispatching itself to all the appropriate clients.p  pWhen the dispatch method is invoked on a Message object, the object spawns a new thread MessageDispatcher for each client in the Client array.p  pEach MessageDispatcherp  ul lipopens a new TCP socket Socket to the clientpli lipdelivers the message to its client... PrintWriter out.printlnmsg textpli lipcreates a Status object which is passed to a Queue in the Message object and then on to the GUI. pli ul  pEach Status object represents ONE of the following eventsp  ul lipMessage passed to Socket via Printwriter out.println pli lipDisplay receipt received from client via BufferedReaderInputStreamReader in.readline... strongblocks until network input is receivedstrong pli lipUser acknowledge receipt received from client via same method as abovepli ul  pSo.. I want to unit test the Message object. using JUnitp  pThe unit test is called MessageTest.java included below.p  pMy first step has been to set up a Message object with a single recipient.p  pI then used JMockit to create a mock Socket object which can supply a mock OutputStream object I am using ByteArrayOutputStream which extends OutputStream to PrintWriter.p  pThen, when the MessageDispatcher calls PrintWriter object.out, the message text will be ideally passed to my mock Socket object via the mock OutputStream which can check that the message text is OK.p  pAnd the sample principle for the InputStreamReader.... The mock Socket object also supplies a mock InputStreamReader object which supplies a mock BufferedReader which is called by the MessageDispatcher as mentioned previously, MessageDispatcher blocks on in.readLine . At this point the mock BufferedReader should supply a fake confirmation to the MessageDispatcher...p  precode mock Socket Mockit.redefineMethodsSocket.class, new Object       ByteArrayOutputStream output  new ByteArrayOutputStream     ByteArrayInputStream input  new ByteArrayInputStream      public OutputStream getOutputStream              return output           public InputStream getInputStream              return input        codepre  pIf this wasnt multithreaded, this should all work OK. However I have no idea how to do this with multiple threads. Can anyone give me any advice or tips p  pAlso if you have any input on the design eg.

In this method I exclusively have class methods, amongst those my method to create object x which create the Object and fill its properties with the information that the method gathers from the web.p  precode ObjX getObjectXNSString key withParametersNSArray parameters codepre  pWithin this method my ObjX is filled with information...p  precodeObjX objectX  [[ObjX alloc] init] ... objectX.name  gatheredName   etc ... return objectX codepre  pSo my class method is invoked at several points from within the app btw. from within a separate threadp  precodeNSAutoreleasePool pool  [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init] ObjX myObject myObject  [GetDetails getObjectX09384f9a withParametersnil] [self performSelectorOnMainThreadselectordoStuffWithNewObject withObjectmyObject waitUntilDoneNO] [pool release] codepre  pI cant get rid of the feeling that this approach is not optimal. The Xcode analyzer also tells me that there might be a potential leak on return objectX.p  pMaybe someone could point me to the right direction and how I should do the splitting up of functionalities in general.p  pIt also doesnt have an init and dealloc method, no ivars, no instance methods...p  hr  pstrongEditstrongp  pOkay, obviously most see no release for the object, so I guess I was not clear with that  the Object will be released later after its assigned to a property of a view. Still, I see that its practice to return an autoreleased object. Unfortunately, my App crashes when I do that. Maybe its because of I am running that whole processing within a separate thread  autorelease pool I will test some configurations and will let you know how it went.p
Negative 7305 pThe C spec states in section 5.5 that reads and writes on certain types namely codeboolcode, codecharcode, codebytecode, codesbytecode, codeshortcode, codeushortcode, codeuintcode, codeintcode, codefloatcode, and reference types are guaranteed to be atomic.p  pThis has piqued my interest. How can you do that I mean, my lowly personal experience only showed me to lock variables or to use barriers if I wanted reads and writes to look atomic that would be a performance killer if it had to be done for every single readwrite. And yet C does something with a similar effect.p  pPerhaps other languages like Java do it. I seriously dont know. My question isnt really intended to be languagespecific, its just that I know C does it.p  pI understand that it might have to deal with certain specific processor instructions, and may not be usable in CC. However, Id still like to know how it works.p  p[EDIT] To tell the truth, I believed that reads and writes could be nonatomic in certain conditions, like a CPU could access a memory location while another CPU is writing there. Does this only happen when the CPU cant treat all the object at once, like because its too big or because the memory is not aligned on the proper boundaryp

Negative 7305 pFrom my understanding of .NET, if I use a BackgroundWorker and have an event handler for RunWorkerCompleted, the event handler will run on the same thread in which RunWorkerAsync was called.  If instead I use BeginInvoke on a delegate to run a method asynchronously, and pass an AsyncCallback parameter to BeginInvoke, is there any way I can specify that the callback runs on the same thread that called BeginInvoke  or for that matter any arbitrary thread  From my understanding the callback runs on the next available thread from the thread pool. Thats fine, but is there a way I can run code in an AsyncCallback on any thread I want  I do know you can use BeginInvoke on a form or control and make code within the callback run on the thread that created the UI element.  But what about if I want to run code on a nonUI thread with no forms or controlsp

Negative 7305 pIm having an intermittent problem when I move a UIImageView around the screen using CAKeyframeAnimation. I want the position of the UIImageView to remain where the animation ends when it is done. This bug only happens for certain start and end points. When I use random points it works correctly most of the time, but about 515 of the time it fails and snaps back to the preanimation position. The problem only appears when using CAKeyframeAnimation using the path property. If I use the values property the bug does not appear.

When this is YES, the bug appears. When I set usePath to NO, the snap back bug does not happen.

This seem pretty reasonable, but I could be mistaken.p  pIm using vertex arrays and glDrawArrays. I dont really have a lot of geometry. I can try to be more precise if needed. Each image is 2 triangles and I try to batch things were possible, though often maybe half the time images are drawn with individual glDrawArrays calls. Besides the images, I have 60 triangles worth of geometry being rendered in 6 glDrawArrays calls. I often glTranslate before calling glDrawArrays.p  pWould it improve the framerate to switch to VBOs I dont think it is a huge amount of geometry, but maybe it is faster for other reasonsp  pAre there certain things to watch out for that could reduce performance Eg, should I avoid glTranslate, glColor4g, etcp  pIm using glScissor in a 3 places per frame. Each use consists of 2 glScissor calls, one to set it up, and one to reset it to what it was. I dont know if there is much of a performance impact here.p  pIf I used PVRTC would it be able to render faster Currently all my images are GLRGBA. I dont have memory issues.p  pOne of my fullscreen textures is 256x256. Would it be better to use 480x320 so the phone doesnt have to do any scaling Are there any other general performance advice for texture sizesp  pHere is a rough idea of what Im drawing, in this orderp  p1 Switch to perspective matrix. 2 Draw a full screen background image 3 Draw a full screen image with translucency this one has a scrolling texture. 4 Draw a few sprites. 5 Switch to ortho matrix. 6 Draw a few sprites. 7 Switch to perspective matrix. 8 Draw sprites and some other textured geometry. 9 Switch to ortho matrix. 10 Draw a few sprites eg, game HUD.p  pSteps 16 draw a bunch of background stuff. 8 draws most of the game content. 10 draws the HUD.p  pAs you can see, there are many layers, some of them full screen and some of the sprites are pretty large 14 of the screen. The layers use translucency, so I have to draw them in backtofront order. This is further complicated by needing to draw various layers in ortho and others in perspective.p  pI will gladly provide additional information if reqested. Thanks in advance for any performance tips or general advice on my problemp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI added some logging to see how many glDrawArrays calls I am doing, and with how much data. I do about 20 glDrawArray calls per frame. Usually about 1 to up to 6 of these has about 40 vertices each. The rest of the calls are usually just 2 vertices one image. Im just using glVertexPointer and glTexCoordPointer.p

Negative 7305 pI have two small http servers. One using the sun com.sun.net.httpserver server and one using an embedded jetty. Now Im trying to get HTTP digest working on at least the jetty server well, that was one of the reasons to use jetty instead of sun httpserver. Regardless of which server I utilize the basic setup is done via spring IOC container.p  pI dont like to use servlets for this purpose well, using jetty I get HTTPServletRequest and HTTPServletResponse objects and Im new to spring security Im just using spring security because it seemed to be to most flexible approach regarding HTTP digest authentication. All I found about spring security was rather terse documented or completely servletfilter oriented.p  pI like to know which is would be the easiest way to enable http digest for my servers. And if spring security is the answer how to wire the spring classes into my IOC container. I can imagine that dealing with http digest needs some manual actions.

We have SQL Server and Oracle code bases, and support customers on Windows, Solaris and Linux servers.p  pMany of the tasks we do on a frequent basis are insufficiently automated, and where they are, tend to be much more automated via shell scripts, with little equivalent functionality on Windows.  Unfortunately, we now have this problem of redeveloping scripts and so on, on two platforms.  So, I wish for us to choose a cross platform language to script in, instead of using Bash and awkwardly translating to Cygwin or Batch files where necessary.p  pIt would need to bep  ol liDynamic so dont suggest Java or Cli liEasily available on each platform Windows, Solaris, Linux, perhaps AIXli liRequire very little in the way of setup root access not always availableli liBe easy for shell scripters, i.e. DBAs, to adopt, who are not hardcore developers.li liBe easy to understand other peoples codeli liFriendly with SQL Server and Oracle, without messing around.li liA few nice XML features wouldnt go amiss.li ol  pIt would be preferable if it would run on the JVM, since this will almost always be installed on every server certainly on all application servers and we have many Java developers in our company, so sticking to the JVM makes sense.  This isnt exclusive though, since I know Python is a very viable language here.p  pI have created a list of options, but there may be more Groovy, Scala, Jython, Python, Ruby, Perl. p  pNo one has much experience of any, except I have quite a lot of Java and Groovy experience myself.  We are looking for something dynamic, easy to pick up, will work with both SQL server and Oracle effortlessly, has some XML simplifying features, and that wont be a turnoff for DBAs.  Many of us are very Bash orientated  what could move us away from this addictionp  pWhat are peoples opinions on thisp  pthanksp  pChris p

Negative 7305 pIve got a slightly odd requirement that Im not sure how to properly articulate.p  pI essentially want to prioritise the emmost recentem requests to an ASP.Net handler. Im not sure if this should be clientside or serverside. Im leaning towards server side to ensure its enforced on all clients.p  pSo, as requests come in, theyre essentially stacked according to some internallydefined time interval, per client. Then, the top of the stack most recent request is processed first.p  pThe reason for this is that the clients will be requesting resources as a user interacts with a client. But the user only cares about the most recent request thats made think constantly seeking in a streamed file  I want to serve the most recent requests first, since thats where the user will want the media to begin playing.p  pHow should I approach this I was thinking something like a singleton, that all requests were sent to, and it handled stacking requests from each client, then sent them off to be processed.p  pIm after some suggestions for other ways to implement what Im suggestion dont have to use a stack. Or proscons and pointers for what Ive described here.p  pstrongUpdatestrong This may be possible, but it is very difficult to get reliable. I can get the requests to be processed out of order, but they are sometimes missed or not received by the client. Im starting to think that perhaps this is clientside functionality, rather than serverside. The client should manage requests more carefully.p  pEg. implement a monitortimer that only sends requests when it determines that the user will likely need the resource. This could be after seeking or if the position is change slowly rather than quickly.p

I can check if BT is enabled or disabled, and I can check if there are any devices paired, but not if any are connected.

Negative 7305 pHeres the basic setup. We have an ASP.Net WebForms application with a page that has a Flash application that needs to access an external Web Service. Due to security I presume limitations in Flash dont ask me, Im not a Flash expert at all, we cant connect to the Web Service directly from Flash. The work around is to create a proxy in ASP.Net that the Flash application will call, which will in turn call the WebService and forward the results back to the Flash application. p  pThe WebSite has very high traffic though, and the issue is, if the Web Service hangs at all, then the ASP.Net request threads will start backing up which could lead to serious thread starvation. In order to get around that, Ive decided to use an a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.ihttpasynchandler.aspxIHttpAsyncHandlera which was designed for this exact purpose. In it, Ill use a WebClient to asynchronously call the Web Service and the forward the response back. There are very few samples on the net on how to correctly use the IHttpAsyncHandler, so I just want to make sure Im not doing it wrong.

Negative 7305 pWe have a script used to edit certain files inline. Basically, each file is broken down into sections, and hovering over a section will bring up a set of tools just a codedivcode with image buttons that you can use to edit that particular section. We have the parent elements sections set as codeposition relativecode, and the set of tools set as codepositionabsolutecode which are set to the right side of the section. This all works fine, especially since many of these are rather small.p  pHowever, we do have many of these sections which can become quite large, reaching lengths of two screens or even more. In these cases we would like for the tools to sort of flow with the users scrolling, so say if the user is looking at the verticalmiddle of the section, the buttons will rest at the vertical middle as well, however, if the vertical center of the users screen scrolls past the section but the user is still hovering over the section, we would like for the tools to remain within their parent element and not be able to pop out.p  pWe already have a script to move an element with the users scroll if it goes out of the screen, so I was thinking I could modify that a bit to do that, Im just not sure how to bound the element by its parent.p  pTLDR How would I create an element that attempts to be vertically centered in the users window, but cannot leave its parent element.p

Negative 7305 pI have been asked to write an android app to connect to a http server. I did this by creating a web service and sending JSON data to a PHP script on the server which opens the desired database and then inserts the decoded JSON objects. p  pNow I am thinking about security. First of all the app will be proprietary, not on the ANdroid Market, but I am worried about two thingsp  ul lisomeone with a phone not in the company somehow gets the app. He can then manipulate the DB.

Negative 7305 pIm not terribly well versed with array manipulation in PHP, so I have a simple porting question. In C I have a map codestdmapltint, intgtcode, for which the implicit ordering on the key is a crucial part of the structure. What I want to do is to sum up all the values for an initial range of keys, which I do like thisp  precode accumulate helper, since valuetype is pairltint, intgt int pairadderint n, const stdmapltint, intgtvaluetype amp p  return n  p.second    To add up values for keys up to N int totalvalueuptotimeNint N    return stdaccumulatemymap.begin, mymap.upperboundN, 0, pairadder  codepre  pWhat would be an idiomatic way to write this data structure and accumulator in PHPp  pTo explain the context The data structure is a simple time series, and I want to know how much I have accumulated at time codeNcode. The C codemapcode is always sorted by key, so I can add elements codemymap[time]  valuecode in any order, and the map always contains the elements in time order.p  pTo explain the accumulation The codeaccumulatecode function sums up all the maps values whose keys are no greater than codeNcode. For example, take this mapp  precode mymap    1, 20, 2, 30, 3, 10, 4, 15  codepre  pThen for codeN  2code I accumulate 50, for codeN  3code I accumulate 40, and for codeN  12code I accumulate 55.p  hr  pemUpdateem I just realized that actually theres no reason why each timestamp should occur only once, so the data structure should really be a codestdmultimapltint, intgtcode. The same accumulation function works verbatim, but if the PHP solution requires the time to be an array key, than that would no longer work. But this is not strictly important I believe a solution in which each time is required to be unique will suffice.p

Negative 7305 pI  was going through ACID properties regarding Transaction and encountered the statement below across the different sites ACID is the acronym for the four properties guaranteed by transactions atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. p  pMy question is specifically about the phrase.p  blockquote   pguaranteed by transactionsp blockquote  p. As per my experience these properties are not taken care by transaction automatically. But as a java developer we need to ensure that these properties criteria are met.p  pLets go through for each propertyp  ol lipAtomicity Assume when we create the customer the account should be created too as it is compulsory.  So now during transaction the customer gets created while during account creation some exception oocurs. So the developer can now go two ways either he rolls back the complete transaction atomicity is met in this case or he commits the transaction so customer will be created but not the account which violates the atomicity. So responsibility lies with developerpli lipConsistency Same reason holds valid for consistency toopli lipIsolation  as per definition isolation makes a transaction execute without interference from another process or transactions.br But this is achieved when we set the isolation level as Serializable. Otherwis in another case like read commited or read uncommited changes are visible to other transactions.  So responsibility lies with the developer to make it really isolated with Serializablepli lipDurability If we commit the transaction, then even if the application crashes, it should be committed on restart of application.  Not sure if it needs to be taken care by developer or by database vendortransactionpli ol  pSo as per my understanding these ACID properties are not guaranteed automatically rather we as a developer sjould achieve them. Please let me know if above understanding regarding each point is correct Would appreciate if you folks can reply  for each pointyesno will also do.p  pAs per my understanding read committed should be most logical isolation level in most application, though it depends on requirement too.p

Negative 7305 pI currently have an application deployed using Tomcat that interacts with a Postgres database via JDBC. The queries are very expensive, so what Im seeing is a timeout caused by Tomcat or Apache Apache sits in front of Tomcat in my configuration. Im trying to limit the connections to the database to 2030 simultaneous connections, so that the database is not overwhelmed. Ive done this using the .. configuration, setting maxActive to 30 and maxIdle to 20. I also bumped up the maxWait.p  pIn this scenario Im limiting the USE of the database, but I want the connectionsrequests to be POOLED within Tomcat. Apache can accept 250 simultaneous requests. So I need to ensure Tomcat can also accept this many, but handle them appropriately.p  pTomcat has two settings in the strongHTTP Connectorstrong config filep  ul listrongmaxThreadsstrong  Max number of request processing threads to be created by the Http Connector, which therefore determines the max number of simultaneous requests that can be handled.li listrongacceptCountstrong  The maximum queue length for incoming connection requests when all possible request processing threads are in use. Any requests received when the queue is full will be refused.li ul  pSo Im guessing that if I set maxThreads to the max number of JDBC connections 30, then I can set acceptCount to 25030  220. p  pI dont quite understand the difference between a thread that is WAITING on a JDBC connection to open up from the pool, versus a thread that is queued... My thought is that a queued thread is consuming less cycles whereas a running thread, waiting on the JDBC pool, will be spending cycles checking the pool for a free thread...p

Negative 7305 pthis is a homework problem.. Im working on a program that uses codeJOptionPanecode to count votes, until Q or q is entered and the vote count stops. It then launches a codeshowConfirmDialogcode which asks the user if they really want to quit. the main task of the program has been accomplished, but one of the instructions states that on the showInputDialog, any entry that is not Y, y, N, n, Q, or q will be ignored. p  pIm having trouble with this because, for some reason any time any button on the dialog box is clicked, the program shuts down.

Negative 7305 h2The Maph2  pIm making a tile based RPG with Javascript, using perlin noise heightmaps, then assigning a tile type based on the height of the noise.p  pThe maps end up looking something like this in the minimap view.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comboOia.png altenter image description herep  pI have a fairly simple algorithm which extracts the color value from each pixel on the image and converts it into a integer 05 depending on its postion between 0255 which corresponds to a tile in tile dictionary. This 200x200 array is then passed to the client.p  pThe engine then determines the tiles from the values in the array and draws them to the canvas. So, I end up with interesting worlds that have realistic looking features mountains, seas etc.p  pNow the next thing I wanted to do was to apply some kind of blending algorithm that would cause tiles to seamlessly blend into their neighbours, emifem the neighbour is not of the same type. The example map above is what the player sees in their minimap. Onscreen they see a rendered version of the section marked by the white rectangle where the tiles are rendered with their images rather than as single color pixels.p  pThis is an example of what the user would see in the map but emit is not the same location as the viewport above showsemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comF0f9E.png altenter image description herep  pIt is in this view that I want the transitioning to occur.p  h2The Algorithmh2  pI came up with a simple algorithm that would traverse the map within the viewport and render another image over the top of each tile, providing it was next to a tile of different type. Not changing the map Just rendering some extra images. The idea of the algorithm was to profile the current tiles neighborsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCetyi.png altAn example of a tile profilep  pThis is an example scenario of what the engine might have to render, with the current tile being the one marked with the X.p  pA 3x3 array is created and the values around it are read in. So for this example the array would look like.p  precode[     [1,2,2]     [1,2,2]     [1,1,2] ] codepre  pMy idea was then to work out a series of cases for the possible tile configurations. On a very simple levelp  precodeifprofile[0][1]  profile[1][1]      draw a tile which is half sand and half transparent      Over the current tile gt profile[1][1]      ...  codepre  pWhich gives this resultp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comR4UPM.png altResultp  pWhich works as a transition from code[0][1]code to code[1][1]code, but not from code[1][1]code to code[2][1]code, where a hard edge remains. So I figured that in that instance a corner tile would have to be used. I created two 3x3 sprite sheets that I thought would hold all the possible combinations of tiles that could be needed. Then I replicated this for all of the tiles that there are in the game The white areas are transparent. This ends up being 16 tiles for each type of tile The center tiles on each spritesheet are not used. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4QXGR.png altSandimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqKUwD.png altSand2p  h2The Ideal Outcomeh2  pSo, with these new tiles and the correct algorithm, the example section would look like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSYNqQ.png altCorrectp  pEvery attempt I have made has failed though, there is always some flaw in the algorithm and the patterns end up strange. I cant seem to get all the cases right and overall it seems like a poor way of doing it.p  h2A Solutionh2  pSo, if anyone could provide an alternative solution as to how I could create this effect, or what direction to go for writing the profiling algorithm, then I would be very gratefulp

SOmething likep  precode  slide 1    image 2   slide 2    image 3    slide 3 codepre  pand so onp  pThis of course works only in a sense the slide, when scrolling, uncovers the following slide, but the previous images are always visible being all removed from the flow due to their fixed positioning.p  pSo I thought at giving the images a codepositionabsolutecode and give codepositionrelativecode to the codeltligtcode but that doesnt make them sticky in the center of the page until the new slides arrives and covers it, they of course naturally follow their parent codeltligtcode in their movement.p  pIm completely at loss on this, and also on how to get the current visibile list in the window. Ive looked at all the built in functions provided by jQuery codescrollTopcode, codeoffset.topcode, codeposition.topcode, I got codewindow.heightcode, the codecontainer.heightcode, codeltligtcodes height is fixed, etc  but all I get are absolute positions of the elements I mean, it doesnt change with scroll, I cannot figure out how to say when a slide is halfway across the screen so that I can do something still dont know what, though.p  pIm sure Im missing something obvious here. Ive studied the code from the linked site, and while I can understand almost everything of it I still cant figure out how it gets the current slide besides, it works differently from mine, as it loads the animated gifs dinamically and only does that for each slide. In mine each slide is a container with different elements, animation, and so on.p  pHow do I get if, for example, codelislide3code is inside view How can I solve the stacked images problem Do I need to set them as fixed dynamically, or recalculate at every scroll their position so that a codepositionabsolutecode would do For this second, I would still need to get the position of each element compared to a fixed point I believe codewindow.scrollTopcode, which so far gives me always 0 while scrolling, but I cant figure out how.p  pOh, Im using the jQuery codescrollcode method to bind the scrolling, as I also have a navigation list which let you jump to the desired slide, and it accounts for this too.p  pI hope I made myself clear on this images must always stay at the center, while scrolling the slides need to cover them up and while the image is being covered the following needs to appear and take its place, so I need to understand how to get the position of the current codeltligtcode element, say when its halfway across the window, and set the previous image accordingly.p

Negative 7305 pIs there a way to find out the emcurrentem number of connection attempts awaiting accept on a TCP socket on Linuxp  pI suppose I could count the number of accepts that succeed before hitting EWOULDBLOCK on each event loop, but Im using a highlevel library PythonTwisted that hides these details. Also its using epoll rather than an oldfashioned selectpoll loop.p  pI am trying to get a general sense of the load on a highperformance nonblocking network server, and I think this number would be a good characterization. Load averageCPU statistics arent helping much, because Im doing a lot of disk IO in concurrent worker processes. Most of these stats on Linux count time spent waiting on disk IO as part of the load which it isnt, for my particular server architecture. Latency between accept and response isnt a good measure either, since each request usually gets processed very quickly once the server gets around to it. Im just trying to find out how close I am to reaching a breaking point where the server cant dispatch requests faster than they are coming in.p

Negative 7305 pI am trying to display the value of a Boolean variable using a codeQCheckBoxcode widget, and render the user unable to change the displayed value. I dont want to disable it, as the resulting graying doesnt look good. I have tried to approximate the effect by changing the new value back to its previous value when the user clicks the codeQCheckBoxcode. However, the problem is compounded by the fact that the state of the widget is described by the checked properties of the codeQAbstractButtoncode parent class, and the state properties of the codeQCheckBoxcode class itself.

Negative 7305 pim going crazy for this. Im trying to write an archive library which can store and extract files. An archive file looks like thisp  precodelt0,homeuserfile.txt,154,0755gt file contents 154 byte codepre  pEach file is identified by an header  lt... , with four tags separated by commas, file type 0 for file and 1 for directory, path, size in bytes, permissions in octal. I retrieve the size and the permissions with the stat system call im on Linux. My problem is that i have to convert the octal value from stmode to a string, store it in the archive file the fourth tag in the header,then extract it and use it with the chmod syscall.p  pTo convert it to string i usep  precodechar mode[6] sprintf mode, o, statr.stmode codepre  pand to retrieve it i use atoi, but it does not seem to work. For example, the value stored in the 4th tag is 100644, but chmod set the permissions wrong file not readable by my user.p  pIm not sure if i explained well, i wil post the whole code if is needed but it dont think there are implementation problem, is just a problem between conversion from octal to stringp  pstrongEDIT Solvedstrong Actually the strtol method worked, but i had forgotten to apply it to the directories too so extracting a directory with files inside caused Segfault because of the bad folders permission mask.

Negative 7305 pI hope this is not too basic to be offtopic, but I am wondering to what extent it is possible to customize WordPress to fit an existing design. I have a design in mind and read somewhere WordPress manuals that it is possible to only manage a small part of a website with WordPress and then slowly migrate the whole site to be WordPressmanaged. If one would like to preserve a certain design, is this preferred to tweaking WordPress templates That is to say, should I start from a website and slowly move into WordPress, or should I start from the WordPress template, and try to tweak it until I arrive at the design I want. Are there any examples of WordPress sites, which fall into lightweight but image heavy websites, which exhibit freedom from the WordPress mold Is this too vaguep

Negative 7305 pWe currently have a WPF application showing some 3D schema and we have made a custom filter that enables to display only items that have certain properties. You can basically add new items to the filter and each item has a combobox to select what property you want to filter on and what values the property must have. We use this filter in the WPF  views, but we also have a COM interface though which we can use it as well, so the filter can be used without a GUI as well.p  pWe are trying to replace the filter with an off the shelf solution if possible. Does anyone know of any existing products with that sort of functionality p
Negative 7305 pIs there a sane way by which we can detect if an codeActivitycode is restarted due to screen orientation change or it is merely started because an codeIntentcode has arrived p  pIn my application, I have a codeFragmentActivitycode that holds two codeFragmentcodes. The users can navigate between these codeFragmentcodes using the codeActionBarcode tabs. Theres also provision that an codeIntentcode to this codeActivitycode can carry an codeEXTRAcode that can hold an indicator to the default tab to be selected. So, when the codeActivitycode starts, any of the two tabs can be selected by default determined by the codeEXTRAcode.p  pThe problem occurs when the user navigates to the other tab from the default selected tab. On rotation change, the codeActivitycode is restarted making the default tab to be selected from codeEXTRAcode again and not selecting the tab the user navigated to.p

Negative 7305 pOK, odd thing is happening on AWS. p  pI downloaded the AWS .NET developer tools and created an elastic beanstalk default instance.  I then, for one reason or another, created another instance via the Visual Studio interface and that instance is where all the clients code  configurations reside. I then returned to the default instance created by elastic beanstalk and terminated it. An hour later, I logged back on and another default instance was up and running. It seems that AWS has detected that I terminated the instance and has spawned another. Some sort of check seems to be in place.  Can somebody tell me what is going on here and how to completely remove the default instance and its termination protection behavior p  pThanks.p

Negative 7305 pWe have a long established, greatly multiplatform codebase that is currently being ported to WinRT. One of the challenges were facing is how to handle WinRTs asynchronous style. p  pFor example, we are unsure how to handle WinRTs async file operations. Unsurprisingly, our codebases API is synchronous. A typical example is our FileOpen function which attempts to open a file and return with success or failure. How can we call WinRT functions and yet keep the behavior of our functions the same p  pNote that we are unfortunately constrained by legacy we cannot simply go and change the API to become asynchronous.p  pThanksp

Negative 7305 pI am creating an RTS game in flash, AS3 for the Epic Flash Game design Contest a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvbpFBraUbHyoamplistUUfkxvxrvpNxXvdKusYS0NfQampindex1 relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvbpFBraUbHyoamplistUUfkxvxrvpNxXvdKusYS0NfQampindex1ap  pAm almost done, except that creating the class which manages all the sounds is being quite a pain. Basically there are only 32 available SoundChannels for AS3 before the buffer overflows. But unfortunately, my RTS handles several dozens of units fighting at the same time, and each unit, especially rifle soldiers  fire multiple shots at a time.p  pIf I let each sound effect be sounded, the buffer would overflow, even if it does not, it would sound very noisy and messy. so the question is, I have seen games like starcraft in the market where there are hundreds of units on screen, yet the sound is pretty unnoisy and organised. I would like to ask how those people achieved this effect What sounds do they accept or filter outp  pCurrently I have 3 possible models 1First in, first out model Accept all sounds being played, but as soon as the buffer limit is reached, the earliest sound in the buffer is silenced.p  p2 Accept or reject model Accept all sounds until the buffer overflows, then reject all further plays until sounds end and the buffer empties.p  p3 Loudest only model Currently my game has a variety of sounds of different loudness, for example, explosions are louder than gunfire effects. In this model, the loudest 32 sounds are being played, if a sound enters which is among the top 32, the lowest of the 32 is kicked and the sound replaces it.p  pWhich model is best, or perhalps you can suggest your own model p.p

Negative 7305 pI am very new to flash but I am learning fairly quickly. I understand about arrays etc but I have promised my boys i would try to make a YuGiOh game for them. I know there are some already out but I want to make a few changes to the original. The problem I can not get past is the array names. Most card games you use 2 types, coderankcode and codesuitcode. With YuGiOh you use about 10 such as codenamecode, codetypecode, codeattackcode, codedefensecode etc.p  pWith all of this in mind I searched through Google and found 2 ways to do this, an XML file which I have not any idea how to use, but the most promising seemed to be to make a card definition codeclasscode which got used by the card class that stored just the card name. p  pIn essence the card def class for say a card named dragon hold all of its values while the card class hold all the different card names. This way I could deal out say 6 card names from the card class and each card would be able to call the value from that cards def. Of course knowing what to do and knowing how to program is 2 separate things. Can anyone tell me of a way this could work please and bear in mind I have been trying to learn flash for a couple of weeks only. p  pEdit, im not allowed to answer my own question for another 5 hrs so will just edit this for now in reply to the answer below.p  pThanks for the reply Floran. I think i can work out the comparators easily enough. The hard part was all the data needed to be held. As an example [Alexandrite Dragon1, monster, light, 4, dragon, 2000, 100] are the stats of the Alexandrite dragon. I was thinking of having that as say the array of the alexandrite dragon and doing 1 of these for each card all held in a card def class.p  pAfter that i would want a card array which would hold each of these so that array may be [alexandrite dragon, ganbara knight] etc so when i dealt the cards if someone drew the alex dragon from the card array [0] then i thought maybe to get that cards atk maybe something like card [0] [5] would get it or even card[0[5]]. Im obviously not sure if this could work and after spending 3 days searching google etc i figured it may be easier to just ask. p
Negative 7305 pI am carrying out some performance test on scientific application and trying to take into account all elements that can affect performance of applicationlike cache size hierarchy cpu speed ... cache line and what ever can be involve with performance. This question comes to my mind although it might be stupid one but i would like to make it obvious to me.p  pstrongemQuestionemstrongp  pif I am not right correct me please.cost of processing int and float or double value is different on processor and that is because of using CPU floating point unit to calculate floating point values .

Dose compiler use cacheing for matrix which all elements have the same values.p  pAltogether processing processing floating value like strongA.Bstrong in which A and B can be numbers with different size in digits if size of A and B have any impact on processing time for example multiplication or not and if there is a difference dose it important to consider it or not .  I am able to measure performance of my application using performance counter library  but because of the overhead of used library you can not say for sure that Instructionflops variation is for random value or other parameter like IDcache miss, cache size, problem size or other parameters.p  pused machine intel E4500. compiler g 4.7.p  pThanksp

However, when I scroll down, I want the above two top left and right subcontainer redblue bars color in fiddle to remain at the top itself and not scroll down with the content.p  pThe plugin creates dom elements inside codecontainerrightframecode div and positions the elements absolute which are then positioned as per codecontainerrightcodes topleft. How do I achieve the fixed kind of positioning for the above two barsp

I am obviously able to get all the unselected items, but I need the one that was just unselected that caused the change event to trigger.p  pSo I have the following function, the bit in the middle is what I need to capture the item that was just unselected. cho is the id of the original select element.p  precodecho.chosen.change function    Need code here to capture what item was just unselected, if any...   codepre

Negative 7305 pI would like to write a program that uses several tabs, each showing a data grid. The data of all the grids is stored in a single data source. Each tab should look identical except for the number of columsrows and the values of course.p  pSo I am now trying to put the grid view into a user control and create a .dll. If a tab is added I put the user control into it  this works already. The grid works in virtual mode and if a new tabgrid is created it calls the event to load the data into the grid.p  pNow I have the problem that the grid and the LoadData event are in the user control while the data source is in my main program. So in the user control the data source is undefined. I thought that this would be ok because you do not run the user control alone and once it is used in the main program the data source should be available to the LoadData event. However, it does not seems to be possible to generate the .dll while the data source is unknown.p  pOn the other hand I do not want to put the data source into the user control because then it is dublicated every time a new tab is created.p  pI hope you can give me a hint what is the best way to implement it.p  pthank you very muchp

Negative 7305 pI just want to understand how android apps update notification works. What are requirements for update notification  to work Google play store ,google services . Any useful link will be helpful.p  pI feel android has information of what are apps purchased by user, so when user connect to internet some service should look for updates available. If this assumption is correct then I want to know information about user owned apps is passed from device or kept server side   I wanted to know updates will work for a side loaded app or not.  p

Negative 7305 pI add codes piece to watch window from code at runtime by copying it from code and adding it to the watch window. If the code contains a method like Convert.ToString, XMLDocument.Load, File.Write etc. of .NETs default namespace such as System.IO, System.Xml etc., then it gives an error The name Convert does not exist in the current context but it does not give an error when I add complete namespace to the added piece of code in watch window, like System.Convert.ToString123 gives correct value. My programs code does not have complete namespace before any .NETs framework method called in it because if I add namespace before any methods call then what is the use of adding namespace on top of each file using using keyword. If I add a namespace above a code in a file then I do not have to add whole namespace in that files code before the methods call. What can I do apart from adding full namespace in watch window every time I copy a code to the watch list, so that the watch does not give error. Please see screenshot below img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxTO90.png altenter image description herep  pUpdate I add method in the watch list to check the result of a method before it is executed. It makes sure the the method execution will not give any error or exception on execution and I can edit the code because the method has not actually been executed in the programs code execution. I put a breakpoint on that methods calling code and add that code in watch window first to check if there is any error, because if I do not do that then I have to rerun the whole program again to correct the value next time.p
Negative 7305 pI have an application where I write logs on a file located on the external memory card. This application runs on a lot of same devices, samsung galaxy S2, and when a user reports a problem we retrieve the logs through an mdm system in order to understand the cause. Every thing works really fine, but sometimes we find that there are holes in the log we see the web services calls in a specific range of time but there are no logs on the file.The code I use to write the code is the following, and I really dont understand how can it be possibilep  precodeFileWriter filewriter  null              try                   filewriter  new FileWriterfile,filewriter.appendmy log messagern                catch Exception e                finally                  try                      filewriter.close                     filewriter  null                  catch Exception e                                 codepre  pthe codefilecode variable is initialized once per usage.p  pWhat could be the cause of the missing log records in which direction should I investigate The only suspect I had was not confirmed by analyzing a users device on the galaxy s2 running android 2.3.5 the mount point of external sdcard is sdcardexternalsd, this virtual path corresponds phisically to the internal memory if there is no external storage, to the external storage otherwise So i thought that the missing records was caused due to a temporary unavailability, for any reason, of the external storage and the file was written in the internal storage, but when I took in my hands a pda where this problem occured there was no file in that path.p  pDoes anyone had similar problems I have no idea how this could happenp  pthanksp

Negative 7305 pI need to parse and manipulate Times without Dates in my code. For example i might get the string 1500 from a timepicker. I want to turn this into a Time object of some kind  I normally work in Python which has distinct Date, Time, and Datetime objects.p  pHowever all the solutions ive seen focus on using the Date object. This cannot parse a string like 1500 since it requires day information. I dont want to add arbitrary Date information to Times  especially since Date appears to make assumptions about things like daylight saving depending on the day and the locale, and there appears to be a risk of it automatically attempting to translate the time into a given locale. Furthermore I want to be able to add times, e.g. 1500  1 hourp  pWhat is the recommended solution to parse and handle raw times not associated to datesp

Negative 7305 pIll make this short and simple. In a side scrolling game, I have a sprite that the user controls, and a sprite that functions as the terrain. The environment sprite class, which in theory could be a floor, ceiling, or wall depending on its location and which direction the player is colliding with it from, needs to do one thing repel the player.p  pIf the player collides with the top of an environment sprite, the player rests on the top border. If a player jumps and collides with the bottom of an environment sprite, they stop moving upwards and begin to fall. Logic rightp  pI cant figure it out. My first solution hopefully illustrates my problem not actual code, just the problem areap  precodeif player.rect.bottom gt environment.rect.top     player.rect.bottom  environment.rect.top  1 if player.rect.top lt environment.rect.bottom     player.rect.top  environment.rect.bottom  1 if player.rect.right gt environment.rect.left     etc.     etc.     etc. codepre  pThis works fine some of the time, but gets real dodgy at corners becase every overlap by more than 1px means two or more sides of the player are actually colliding with an environmental sprite at a time. This, in a nutshell, is the problem I face with every solution Ive tried.p  pIve lurked every thread, tutorial,  video, blog, guide, faq, and help site I could reasonably and even unreasonably find on google, and I have no idea. Surely this is a thing someone has addressed before  I know it, Ive seen it. Im looking for advice, possibly a link, just anything to help me get over what I can only assume is a simple solution I cant find.p  pstrongHow do you recalculate the positions of colliding sprites with respect to any and all directionsstrongp  pBONUS I have gravity implemented too  or at least a near constant downward force. In case it matters.p
Negative 7305 pI have an MFC app that uses Rogue Waves Stingray Studio Objective Grid to display a dialog with a grid in it. When doing a print preview, the grid uses the MFC print preview mechanism to generate the print preview dialog. On the dialog I see all the buttons you would expect, including next and previous, and zoom in and zoom out. I have more than one page worth of data in the grid and so I see a scroll bar on the right, the Next button is enabled and the previous button is disabled. If I click on the next button, the dialog advances the preview to the next page of the data, and I see the scroll bar move down accordingly, but the Prev button does not become enabled. I can use the scroll bar to scroll in both directions, but the Prev button never becomes enabled and the Next button never disables when I reach the last page. I see a similar problem with the Zoom buttons. I can zoom in, but the zoom out button never enables so I can never zoom out anymore.p  pHas anyone seen this sort of behaviour before and know what causes itp
Negative 7305 pIve got a Repeater control, bound to a codePagedDataSourcecode, which datasource is a list of custom controls Ive made. These custom controls contains a couple of text boxes.p  pI have a save button, and when it is clicked I want to save the data in all the custom controls to a database, no matter which page they are on  but currently I only got access to the custom controls displayed on the current page.p  pWhat Ive tried to do is to, in the codebtnSaveClickcode event, create a new temporary datasource equal to the current one, except its not a codePagedDataSourcecode. That way my repeater contains all custom controls  BUT  the changes made in the textbox fields are no longer available. I then tried to add JavaScript onchange events on the textboxes in the custom control, so that a postback would be fired whenever text was changed, and the property in the user control codebehind would be updated. This didnt work either.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 7305 pI need to create a new list via the python C API containing new copies of objects of a codeQuaternioncode class Ive written in C.  [Actually, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19532871creatinganumpyarrayofcustomclassobjectswithcapiId really like a numpy arraya, but any sort of sequence would do.]  But Im getting seg faults with everything Ive tried.  Im terrible with pointers, so thats not a big surprise.  Im thinking maybe I need to give python ownership of the objects I create with codenewcode.p  pThe best Ive gotten so far appears below.  Am I not supposed to copyconstruct the Quaternion while codenewcodeing it  Am I doing something else stupid  Do I need to tell python it owns the reference now  Should the returned list exist and live a happy life, as I expectedp  precodePyObject ObjectifystdvectorltQuaterniongtamp v    Pyssizet size  v.size   PyArrayObject list  PyArrayObject PyListNewsize   forPyssizet i0 iltsize i      PyObject o  PyObject new Quaternionv[i]     PyListSETITEMPyObjectlist, i, o      return PyArrayReturnlist  codepre  pI can verify that the list still has the correct elements just before the return.  That is, after the loop above, I make a new loop and print out the original values next to the list values, and they match.  The function will return, and I can keep using python.  But once the list is used outside the loop, the segfaults happen.p  p[Actually, this is all being done in SWIG, and this code is found in a typemap with slightly different variable names, but I can look in the codewrap.cxxcode file, and see that its just how I would have written it.]p

Negative 7305 pI have a Django project in which I have a view subclassed from the Django codeCreateViewcode class. This view is used to upload a file to the server, and uses an codeUploadedFilecode model which I have created. The codeUploadedFilecode also needs to be associated with a project, which is stored as a codeForeignKeycode called codeprojectcode in the codeUploadedFilecode model.p  pThe project id is passed in as part of the URL coderprojectsPltprojkeygtd, UploadedFileCreateView.asview, , uploadnewcodep  pBecause codeprojectcode is not really a form field, I know I need to exclude it using a codeModelFormcode however, even after I have done so, django never enters the codeformvalidcode method if I put a logging call in it, it will never be written to the log, though logging works fine. Im guessing that the codeForeignKeycode is the culprit because as far as I can tell it worked before I added that in.

Negative 7305 pI am using the HttpContext.Current.Session.IsNewSession to decide on what page to show when my MVC4 application launches.p  pThis works great on desktop, iOS safari.p  pHowever on iOS Chrome, every time I close the browser actually close tabs and close the application from the task manager and relaunch it the IsNewSession is always false.p  pI am guessing it uses the session cookie ASP.NETSessionId to track this as there is a new cookie value when I close my desktop or safari.p  pHowever on iOS Chrome, when I close and relaunch the cookie has the old value  which I am guessing is the root of the issue.p  pSo why does iOSChrome not clear my ASP.NETSessionId cookie even though it should be a Session cookie and deleted when the browser is closed.p  pThanks.p

I must rename the class name and file name separately, and its sometimes annoying for me, because I always forget on it, so it results to that I have different class and file names. Is there option in Visual Studio to put the renaming in one stepp
Negative 7305 pI have implemented a custom adapter class for controlling my listview. Im implementing a button, a textbox and a checkbox against each row in the listview.

Negative 7305 pIve got a scenario Im trying to implement in my app where Id like to make a codeUIScrollViewcode behave more stiff once you start forcing it to scroll past its normal content bounds.p  pWhat I mean by this, is when youre either at the top or bottom of a scroll view, if you tap down and keep dragging, you can usually get the scroll view to keep scroling beyond its bounds, but it gradually builds up resistance, until it stops usually about half way in the middle of the views bounds. When you lift your finger, it snaps back to the bounds of the scroll region.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve, is Id like to make that outofbounds dragging effect a lot more heavy, so instead of the user dragging the scroll view and it bottomingout mid way through the scroll view bounds, it completely stops around 20 or so past its scrolling bounds instead.p  pIve been experimenting with overriding the scroll views codecontentOffsetcode inside the codescrollViewDidScrollcode delegate method, but that doesnt seem to work since resetting the contentOffset in there seems to screw up further delegate calls of the same method.p  pMy next idea was to monitor the codeUIPanGestureRecognizercode associated with the scrollview and try and determine the proper codeUIScrollViewcode contentOffset based off events coming out of that. That being said, I thought that might start getting on the hacky side, so I thought Id ask here for any other solutions I hadnt considered before I try something that could potentially be messy.p  pThanksp

So, does Java add one in at compile time  I tried explicitly adding one codeMaincode in to this statement, but the code wouldnt compile.p  precodeParentClass.InnerClass ic  new ParentClass.new InnerClass codepre

Negative 7305 pI am playing around with WCF and have a very simple WCF Service Library and Windows Application.  In the service library, I have the followingp  precodePublic Class Service1 Implements IService1  Dim MyRandomNumber As Integer Dim upperbound As Integer  50 Dim lowerbound As Integer  1  Public Function GetDataByVal value As String As String Implements IService1.GetData     Return String.FormatYou entered 0, value End Function  Public Function SendMetrics As Integer Implements IService1.SendMetrics      Return MyRandomNumber  End Function  Public Sub CreateRandomNumber Implements IService1.CreateRandomNumber      MyRandomNumber  CIntMath.Floorupperbound  lowerbound  1  Rnd  lowerbound  End Sub  Public Function GetDataUsingDataContractByVal composite As CompositeType As CompositeType Implements IService1.GetDataUsingDataContract     If composite Is Nothing Then         Throw New ArgumentNullExceptioncomposite     End If     If composite.BoolValue Then         composite.StringValue amp Suffix     End If     Return composite End Function codepre  pEnd Classp  pVery simple...  What I am testing is running a sub and then returning the value created by the sub mainly because my application will be doing some sending and receiving and I want to test the ability to run a subroutine and the ability to return data from the service.p  pNow... when I run CreateRandomNumber from my userform.. and then subsequently call SendMetrics from my userform  I always get 0.   The random numbers lifetime seems to be expiring.  I dont think it is how my form is calling it.. I have thisp  precodePublic Class Form1  Dim client As New ServiceReference1.Service1Client  Private Sub Button1Clicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles Button1.Click      Dim returnString As String      returnString  client.GetDataTextBox1.Text     Label1.Text  returnString End Sub  Private Sub Button2Clicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles Button2.Click      Dim returnString As Integer      returnString  client.SendMetrics     TextBox2.Text  returnString End Sub  Private Sub Button3Clicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles Button3.Click     client.CreateRandomNumber End Sub End Class codepre  pThat seems correct to me.

Negative 7305 pI am developing an app which is basically one widget and one service. The widget is only a button which I want it to run the service in the devices background. So the user just clicks the button and nothing happens in the UI, the service starts in the background. But I want the background service, which I have implemented using IntentService, to ALWAYS listen to my devices shake in the background after the widgets button is clicked. It has to monitor the accelerometer sensor for any change at any time. Finally I want to open a certain application if the user shakes his device.p  pI have implemented the widget part, I click the button and the service runs. I have also implemented the shake part, I can get the shake and do some stuff after the shake. I also know how to open another application after the shake. I just cant do this through the service So my question is thisp  ul liDo I have to make my IntentService class implement SensorEventListenerli liIf yes, is only this implementation enough for it to listen to the sensor at all times What should I do in onHandleIntentIntent intent then li liAll the sensor changes are going to be listened in onSensorChangedSensorEvent sensorEvent if it was implemented in a regular Activity.

Negative 7305 pI have been surfing on the internet and found an interesting video in which is mentioned that you can find number of primes between 1 and any number n using Riemann hypothesis and Riemann zeta function. My math knowledge is not this high and I dont understand how, using zeta function, can one find number of primes. p  pI wanted to write a program that takes one number as input and outputs number of primes to that number, which is calculated using aforemention zeta function, but I have no idea where to start learning.

Negative 7305 pI have a UITextView which displays some notes the user wrote down. There are multiple pages of notes. I added a swipe gesture recognizer to the text view so that it flips to the next page if the user swipes to the left, and previous page if the user swipes to the right. I want to add sliding animations when the user swipes. That is, when the user swipes to the left, the current page slides out to the left and the following page slides in from the right.p  pI saw some other posts saying that codeCATransitioncode can be used for this purpose but looks like there has to be at least two views, but I only have one here the UITextView. So whats the best way to achieve the sliding effect in my casep  pstrongEDITstrong Looks like codeUIScrollViewcode, the super class of codeUITextViewcode could be configured to enable the paging effect. Is there anyway to directly enable paging on the scroll view part of the text viewp
Negative 7305 pHeres the set up, I want to build a single page web app, Dart and Angular dart are my front end tools.p  pFor server back end Im using PHP with a view of it being only the CDN for the web app and a REST api for data to serve this web app.p  pI need to build in some log in and authentication and Ive settled on Openid to make sign up and login as easy as possible.

Negative 7305 pI need some help with a SQL query. An additional requirement is that it must work on mysql, which does not have support for FULL OUTER JOINs if that is indeed part of the answer.p  pIm not terrible at SQL, but this is pretty tricky. Ive tried a few things, but Im not sure where to start, to be honest.p  pIn essence, I want to union values from two columns in two different tables But the two tables have different mumber of rows, where Table A has more rows than Table B. For the missing columns in Table B, I want to pad out with the values from the row in Table A which I am linking to. p  pMy real life example, is that codeTable Acode contains a list of Concepts, each with a term, and codeTable Bcode provides synonyms for the Concepts term in codeTable Acode.p  pI need to union the terms and synonyms but not concat into one column, and then calculate the length of the unioned term in a separate column. In the end, the record will be used to create a Solr Document with a single, unioned, indexed, and searchable column. I will then Sort my queries by the shortest term or synonym hence the length column.p  pBut lets simplify this a bit, and try to come up with a tightly defined problem statement.

Negative 7305 pI have a bit complex situation. It may can easily be solved by inheritance, but I am now curious and due some other reasons I would solve it this way.p  pI have class which represents an algorithm and with time a different solution has been implemented.

I would have both of the algorithm and a switch to be able to use them according to the situation. p  precodeinclude B.h class A  public     typedef void  AFooFunction  float, float      AFooFunction mfooFunction     B mb      A WhichUseEnum algorithm   mb B               switch algorithm           case ALGA             mfooFunction  ampAFooFunctionOfA             break         case ALGB             mfooFunction    something like mb.FooFunctionOfA             break                    void FooFunction float a , float b                thisgtmfooFunction  a, b            void FooFunctionOfA float, float   implementation at the .cpp   class B  public     void FooFunctionOfB float, float   codepre  pAs you can see, I want to save the pointer to function of the member mb and call it as the FooFunction does. With the own function  FooFunctionOfA  I was already successful, but the other is much harder. I tried several idea, but I could not find the version which was accepted by the compiler. p  pI found a similar question where the solution looked like this codeampmb.mb.FooFunctionOfBcode and at this point I gave it up. p  pIf anybody has some idea, pleas do not hesitate to share with me.p  pI am using C but not C0x AND I am forced to avoid stl and boost.p

I was changing the image size to fit the screen, I though JCrop would take care of that for me but it seems you have to tell JCrop the original dimensions of the image. Ive added the true size option when initializing JCrop and it seems were almost there.p  pFor smaller images, those under 1000px the cropper seems to be working great. But for larger ones 1000px  its producing black images. It doesnt do this when I use it with the JCrop demo script but the only difference between the two is one is outputting the file to the screen and the other is saving it. I cant see any other difference or figure out why this would happen.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong It seems to only be affected if Im running the code through Ajax. If I run the exact same function just posting to a page and running it at the top, the thumbnail is created perfectly every time, no matter what the size of the original image or the size of the box I draw.p

Negative 7305 pI am using codahale metrics for monitoring purposes. Lets say there is a spike in latency at some point and later there are no values reported due to attribute that there are no traffic, the value in the graph stays as isI am using a histogram. At times it gives a notion that the spike remains and we might need to address it, but it actually means that no values are reported after that and hence the graph doesnt decay. Am I missing any config parameter in this case or is the behaviour expected p  pThe way we update the metrics is metrics.processingTime.updateprocessingTimep  pSo, when there is no traffic, we dont update this metric.p
Negative 7305 pFollowing on from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24651295activerecordqueryingatreestructureefficientlythis questiona, I have a situation where I have a heirarchy of objects in my Rails 3 application that is perhaps eight relationships deep, mostly through codehasmanycode and codebelongstocode relationships, so for example A codeproject hasmany userscode, codeuser hasmany permissionscode, a codeproject hasmany nodescode, a codenode belongsto permissioncode, a codenode hasmany propertiescode, a codeproperty hasmany edithistoriescode and so on. Its all fairly standard stuff, but there is a fair amount of it. This is an application which is already in production, so that architecture is one I am currently tied to. p  pThe problem I am having is that sometimes  for example when we open a Project  I want to eagerload pretty much everything, and other times I dont. So I dont want everything to be eagerloaded by default. When I do want everything, in spite of a serious list of preloads, Im running into some serious N1 problems, to the point that loading a single page is enacting hundreds of queries and in some situations requests simply time out. Using a hrefhttpsgithub.comflyerhzmbullet relnofollowBulleta has not shown any obvious missing codeincludecode statements on my relationships but when I look at the SQL that is being generated one thing I notice is some enormous IN queries with hundreds of ids on them although they are working with a primary key, that seems like a clunky way to retrieve data.p  pIf I was writing something like this from scratch I would probably put together a single sophisticated SQL statement that pulled out all the data in one shot  based on some things I know but ActiveRecord probably doesnt  and then match up the relationships afterwards. Obviously that would break the whole database agnostic thing, but right now pages timing out is going to trouble our users a lot less even if they did care about the purity of a Rails application, which they dont. My question isp  pIs there a way of doing something like this in ActiveRecord or a gem that would be able to help Are there any other ways of minimising the number of queries that are performed or any other tricks to bring this very hierarchical data back in a timely fashionp

Negative 7305 pCurrently at my company, we have three servers Development , Staging, and Production. When a new feature is requested, it is developed in the Development environment serverVM. Once the developer is satisfied that its complete, they move it to the Staging environment and test it. Once it is fully tested, it is moved to the Production server.p  pThe problem is that the team is very small and its hard to manually maintain the Staging and Production Environment. We need the staging environment to be exactly like the Production environment, and it is time consuming task to do that manually everytime.p  pIs there a software out there that can help or a processp  pOne method we thought could be possible is Cloning the Production Environment every time and use it as Staging.

Negative 7305 pI need help with something I cant get my head wrapped around regarding the emRepositoryem and emServiceUsecaseem pattern part of emDDDem design I want to implement in my next Laravel PHP project. p  pAll seems clear. Just one part of DDD that is confusing is the data structures from repositories. People seem to choose data structures the Repository should return arrays or entities but it all has disadvantages. One of which is performance looking at my experiences in the past. And one is which you dont have interfaces for simple data structures array or simple object attributes.p  pIll start with explaining the experience I have with a previous project. This project had flaws but some good strengths I learned from and like to see in my new project but with solving some design mistakes. p  pstrongPrevious experiencestrongp  pIn the past Ive build a website that was API Centric using the Kohana framework and Doctrine 2 ORM data mapper pattern. The flow looked like thisp  pemWebsite controller  API client HMVC calls  API controller  Custom Repository  Doctrine 2 ORM native RepositoryEntitymanageremp  pMy custom Repository returned plain arrays using Doctrine2 DQL. Doctrine2 recommends array result data for read only operations. And yes, it made my site nice and light. The API controller just converted the array data to JSON. Simple as that.p  pIn the past my company created projects relying fully on loaded Doctrine2 entities and its something we regretted due to performance.p  pMy REST API supported queries likebr codeapiusersincludelatestadverts2ampincludelocationtruecodebr on the users resource. The API controller passed codeincludelocationcode to the repository which directly included the location relation. The controller read codelatestadverts2code and called the adverts repository to get the latest 2 adverts of each user. Arrays were returned. p  pFor example first user arrayp  precode[     name     avatar     adverts [         advert 1 [             name             price          ]         advert 2 [             .          ]     ] ] codepre  pThis proved to be very successful. My whole website was using the API. It would be very easy to to add a new client because the API was perfectly in production already using oauth. The whole website runs on it.p  pBut this design had flaws too. My controller still contained A LOT of logic for validation, mailing, params or filters like codehasadvertstruecode to get users with adverts only. It would mean that if I created a new port, like a total new CLI interface, I would have to duplicate alot of these controllers due to all the validation etc. But no duplication if I would create a new client. So at least one problem was solved p  pMy admin panels were completely coupled to the doctrine2 repositoryentitymanager to speed up development sort of. Why Because my API had fat controllers with special functionality for the website only special validation, mailing for registering etc. I would have to redo work or refactor a lot. So decided to use the Entities directly to still have some sort clear way of writing code instead of rewriting all my API controllers and move them to Services for site amp admin for instance. Time was an issue in fixing my design mistakes.p  pFor my next project I want all code to go through my own custom repositories and services. One flow for good separation.p  pstrongNew project using DDD ideas and dilemma with data structuresstrongp  pWhile I like the idea of being API centric, I dont want my next project to be API centric in core because I think the same functionality should be available without the HTTP protocol in between. I want to design the core using DDD ideas.p  pBut I liked the idea using a layer that just talked as a API and returns simple arrays. The perfect base for any new port, including my own frontend. My idea is to consider my Service classes as the API interface return the array data, do the validation etc. I could have Services specially for the website registering and plain services used by the Admin or background processes. In some admin cases a Service would not be required anyway for simple CRUD editing, I could just use Repositories directly. Controllers would be very thin. With this creating a real REST API would just be a matter to create new controllers using the same Services my frontend controller classes do. p  pFor internal logic like business rules it would be useful to have Entities clear interfaces instead of arrays from repositories. This way I could benefit from defining some methods that did some logic based on attributes. BUT If I would be using Doctrine2 and my repositories would always return Entities my application would suffer a big performance hit p  pOne data structure ensures performance but no clear interfaces, the other ensures clear interfaces but bad performance when using a Data Pattern pattern like Doctrine 2 now or in the future. Also I could end up with two data types which would be confusing.p  pI was thinking something similar to this flowp  pemController thin  UserService incl. validation  UserRepository just storage  Eloquent ORMemp  pWhy Eloquent instead of Doctrine2 Because I want to stick a bit to whats common within the Laravel framework and community. So I could benefit from third party modules, for example to generate admin interfaces or similar based on models bypassing my DDD rules. Other than using third party modules, I would design my core stuff so switching should always be easy and not affect data structure choices or performance.p  pEloquent is an activerecord pattern. So I would be tempted to convert this data to POPOs like Doctrine2 entities are. But nope... as said above, with doctrine2 real models would make the system very fat. So I fall back to simple arrays again. Knowing this would work for both and any other implementation in the future.p  pBut it feels bad always rely on arrays. Especially when creating internal business rules. A developer would have to guess values on arrays, have no autocompletion in his IDE, could not have special methods like in Entity classes. But making two ways of dealing with data feels bad too. Or I am just too perfectionist  I want ONE clear data structure for allp  pBuilding interfaces and POPOs would mean a lot of duplicate work. I would need to convert an Eloquent model just a table mapper, not entity to an entity object implementing this interface. All is extra work. And eventually my last layer would be just like a API, thus converting it to arrays again. Which is extra work too. Arrays seem the deal again.p  pIt seemed so easy reading up into DDD and Hexagonal. It seems so logic But in reality I struggle with this one simple issue trying to stick to OOP principles. I want to use arrays because its the only way to be 100 sure I am not depended on any model choice and querying choice from my ORM regarding performance etc and dont have duplicate work in converting to arrays for views or an API. But theres no clear contract on how a user array could look. I want to speed up my project using these patterns, not slow them down  So not an option to have many converters.p  pNow I read a lot of topics. One makes POPOs amp interfaces that conform proper entities like Doctrine2 could return, but with all the extra work for Eloquent. Switching to Doctrine2 should be fairly easy, but would impact performance so bad or one would need to convert Doctrine2 array data to these own entity interfaces. Others choose to return simple arrays. p  pOne convinces people to use Doctrine2 instead of  Eloquent, but they leave out the fact that Doctrine2 is heavy and you really need to use array results for read only operations. p  pWe design repositories to be changeable right Not because its nice by design only. So how could we rely on full Entities if it has such big impact on performance or duplicate work Even when using Doctrine2 only coupled this same issue would arise due to its performance p  pAll ORM implementations would be able to return arrays, thus no duplicate work there. Good performance. But we miss clear contracts. And we dont have interfaces for arrays or class attributes as a workaround... Ugh  p  pstrongDo I just miss a missing block in our programming languages Interfaces on simple data structuresstrongp  pIs it wise to make all arrays and have advanced business logic talk to these arrays Thus no classes with clear interfaces. Any precalculated data normally would be returned by an Entity method would be within an array key defined the Service class. if not wise, whats the alternative considering all of the abovep  pI would really appreciate if someone with great experience in this domain considering performance, different ORM implementations, etc could tell me how heshe has dealt with thisp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7305 pI have a web application that should trigger an execution of a batch file on a server at some point. One of the tasks of the batch file is starting a browser on the server machine and doing some onscreen related things  thats why I need it to run in an actual window on the machine and not in a windowless hidden mode.p  pI tried to use codeProcesscode class for this, but it only allowed me to run things behind the scenes.

Seems like it should be there if the user has User Management role. p  pIs there any other way to provide basic level user management delegation to an application adminp  pThe only other way I can see is for a user admin to create a whole new azure subscription but part of same tenant and go through the management portal  which is not ideal because they have access to other Azure resources creating instances, db etc. I only need the admin to be able to access user management of ADp  pI know I can create another application and use the Graph API but this might be reinventing the wheel if Azure AD already has something like this. p

Negative 7305 pIn my project, I am currently creating a slider in my codebehind the view and this slider has an event for when its value changes. The place where the slider is created also has a custom object that is required for this project.p  pI wanted to have this custom object used as a property of the slider similar to say codeTicksPropertycode within codeSlidercode, so that this could be passed through the codeobject sendercode parameter of my codeSliderValueChangedcode event that Ive created. The reason for this was so that I could execute an existing command from another class my codeViewModelcode which uses this custom object as a parameter, everytime the value property changed.p  pHowever, I was aware that there was no way of adding a property to an existing WPF control so I decided to try an create a codeCustomSlidercode class that inherits from codeSlidercode, where it has this codeCustomObjectcode as a codeDependencyPropertycode.

Negative 7305 pI have a view which contains a square subview gray. This square subview then contains four smaller squares bluep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyS3Vr.png altenter image description herep  pEach of the squares are pinned to the top or bottom of the superview, and the left or right of the superview. For example, the topleft square has a constraint which pins the leading space to the superview and another constraint which pins the top space to the superview. Similarly, the bottomright has constraints which pin the bottom and trailing spaces to the superview.p  pI am having real difficultly implementing constraints which will result in the squares resizing based upon the screen size. I have put horizontal and vertical spacing constraints between the squares, but that results in a warning that the content compression resistant priority on one of the squares needs to be reduced. When its reduced, that square becomes tiny as the other square takes over all the space.p  pI just want each of the squares to be an equal size and resized by autolayout to fit the screen.p  pAny help would be appreciatedp

For JDK 1.2 and later use       the context ClassLoader.           public static ClassLoader findClassLoader              if System.getSecurityManagernull              this will ensure bootclassloader is used             return null                    Figure out which ClassLoader to use for loading the provider          class.  If there is a Context ClassLoader then use it.         ClassLoader context  SecuritySupport.getContextClassLoader         ClassLoader system  SecuritySupport.getSystemClassLoader          ClassLoader chain  system         while true              if context  chain  ...loop to get correct class loader          codepre  pNow in our project we have the problem that we have a SecurityManager implementation in place which means this implementation above just returns codenullcode instead of the context classloader.p  pBTW I would also expect to get the context classloader here, but with additional checks later if the SecurityManager allows to load a class, why des it just return null herep  pThis again means that my class is tried to be loaded with the boot classloader which does not know my class and therefore throws the exception. Removing the SecurityManager returns the context classloader which is able to load my class and the XML can be successfully transformed.p  pSo  if you are still here and asleep  is there a way to be able to still use my external Java methods in the XSL stylesheets Is there a way to load my class in this situation I thought about the following maybe possible solutions, but they all do not really satisfy mep  ul lipatch the ObjectFactory, remove or extend the check for a SecurityManager and put it on the boot classpath of my application that it is loaded before the original one dirty hackli liremove the SecurityManager is more or less a dummy implementation for now, but this would not be a permanent solutionli liwrite the Java methods as extension functions in XSL not sure if this works for all methods we have and would be very timeconsuming and errorprone also Im not sure if this really solves the issueli lipuse reflection to create an instance of my JavaClass inside the XSL in the following wayp  p pli ul  pHowever, the last way is also not working as the class is also loaded with the AppClassLoader and probably also not available during the parsing process. But maybe there is a similar solutionp  pThanks in advance.p  pBest Regards, Jensp

Negative 7305 pIm writing a simple and small program in Ruby to output the ordinal of a number based on user input. Here is what I wrotep  precodeputs Enter a number number  gets.chomp.toi  conversion  number  10  if number  11  number  12  number  13   puts That is numberth  end  if conversion  1   puts That is numberst elsif conversion  2   puts That is numbernd elsif conversion  3   puts That is numberrd else    puts That is numberth  end   codepre  pAs my code shows, I wanted to take the number from the user input, cut off the last number, and use that single digit number to determine whether number should be a first, second, third, or fourth type of ordinal. The conversion value should convert that for me. However, it can be seen that the numbers 11, 12, and 13 are exceptions. My program works fine except that when I input one of these three values, I get two outcomes, not one, in the terminal such as p  precodeThat is 11st That is 11th codepre  pMy intention is that 11th should be displayed, not 11st. Even though I tried to write an exception into my code, the conversion still gets executed. Im not sure what error I made, but is there a way I can isolate the first if statement, so that my conversion does not include 11, 12, and 13p

Negative 7305 pI created an MVC app using VS Express for web.  It it will only use the default built in CSS file that VS Express comes with.br Example  If I modify the bootstrap.css file change jumbotron color, and run locally from VS, the changes are apparent, however when i web deploy, none of those changes are apparent.  I also noticed when I modify the web.config file to Debugfalse, the CSS changes Ive made are not apparent when I run it locally from VS and on web deploy.  p  pCSS is still being applied, however any changes I make are not applied.  The site shows the old default jumbotron color.  If I change debugtrue in the web.config then the jumbotron shows my updated color.  When I web deploy my site none of the CSS changes are applied, it still uses the default CSS file, I even checked bootstrap.css on the server and it shows the updated jumbotron color, but the jumbotron is still the default color on the web  Super confusing.p  pI have done a lot of reading, tried adding the following to my web.configp  precodeltremove nameBundleModule gt ltadd nameBundleModule typeSystem.Web.Optimization.BundleModule gt codepre  pbut that doesnt fix it.  I tried removing .css from my file names, this fixed the problem when I run it locally from VS using debugfalse, however when I publish the website the site shows no CSS styles at all.

If I take out the codecommands.addversioncode, it will get the input that is output when running java.exe command on command line, so it seems adding the codeversioncode arguement is causing issues and this also indicates that the directory and java.exe commands are correct. Any help would be appreciated. p

It outputs the files and I throw them into a folder called Foundation. I then throw in my WordPress files, and throw that Foundation folder into the theme Im working on in WP in my assets folder. I know in the YouTube video CodeKit mentions not to pull the files out so that any linking isnt messed up, but I cant keep those files in the root of my project because they need to be within the theme. p  pSo it looks like thisp  pcodewordpressthemeassetsfoundationcodep  pAssets is also where my sass files live for the overall sitep  pcodewordpressthemeassetssasscodep  pWhere I get hung up is in the compiling of the files. p  pI have one master style.sass file where I import all my partials and that works correctly. I want to include the foundation codeapp.scsscode file so everything is in one place, but it doesnt call it up. It says the compiling is complete, but when I look at the code its just the import line without the foundation code actually being outputted. I also found that if I place my sass partials in a folder called partials, CodeKit cant compile them, even though Im importing them with the folder name, example codepartialslayoutcode, instead of codelayoutcode. p  pIm doing this locally so I cant show you the link, but I guess I just feel like Im setting this up entirely wrong.p  pstrongMy question arestrongp  pHow do others setup their projects on CodeKit with WordPress and Foundationp  pIs it correct to import .scss files into a .sass file  p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 7305 pIn my Android apps im using a hrefhttpsquare.github.iootto relnofollowOttoa as event bus and a hrefhttpsquare.github.iodagger relnofollowDaggera for dependency injection.p  pIn the userguide of Otto and in many blog posts its recommended to use injection to get a bus singleton. I have done that for some time, but lately im getting more doubtful if injecting the bus has any advantages over using a simple static singleton.p  pWith injection i have to inject every custom View or ViewHolder that i want to be able to post UI events on the bus. Especially with dagger it seems a bit clumsy to inject every class where i need the bus. Sure, i could pass the bus by constructor or setter method, but that can be kind of clumsy too if you think about an adapter with many different view types for example.p  pAnd i dont see any advantages in injecting the bus. In case of Otto a concrete implementation is injected an instance of Bus and that will never change. Wrapping Otto for decoupling does not make any sense if think, because of the way subscription works.p  pSo, does anyone see any advantages of injecting Otto that i dont seep

The problem is, I want the text to always be aligned to the top of the parent div the red box in the jsFiddle, however nothing I have tried makes that work.  The more text you type into the text field, the closer it gets to the top of the DIV, but this isnt the solution Im looking for. It should work no matter how much or little you have typed.  I have tried changing the inner span to a div, all different display types inlineblock, block, tablecell, etc, verticalaligntop, absolute positioning, using jQuery to calculate margins, and more.  Ive run out of ideas.  Please see the jsFiddle to get an idea of what Im talking about.  The blue box around the text is just for reference.

Differences between different vendor product lines like Atmel AT24C or   MicroChip 24LC, etc wont much matter for typical readwrite access.   There are also I2C RAM chips, likewise interchangeable. One example   would be the PCF8570, which acts like a 24c02 EEPROM 256 bytes.     However, misconfiguration can lose data. Set 16bit memory address   to a part with 8bit addressing will overwrite data. Writing with too   big a page size also loses data. And its not safe to assume that the   conventional addresses 0x50..0x57 only hold eeproms a PCF8563 RTC   uses 0x51, for just one example.     Accordingly, explicit boardspecific configuration data should be used   in almost all cases. One partial exception is an SMBus used to access   SPD data for DRAM sticks. Those only use 24c02 EEPROMs.     So this driver uses new style I2C driver binding, expecting to be   told what devices exist. That may be in archXmachYboardZ.c or   similar kernelresident tables or, configuration data coming from   a bootloader.     Other than binding model, current differences from eeprom driver are   that this one handles write access and isnt restricted to 24c02 devices.

I have tried replicating this in my own app with StrictMode on and dont get this error.p  pI understand that I should be calling coderesponse.body.closecode but Im still a little confused about why this isnt happening in my app. The stack trace that he sent me only has my classes in it so it doesnt seem like anything in his code is causing it.p  pAlso of note is that only one of the request my SDK makes actually has the response read. But that is not the request my user says is causing the exception.p  pIs there anything else that could be causing this p  pWhen should I call code.closecode Would calling it immediately after calling codeexecutecode be advisable Would closing the body prevent it from being read in the futurep
Negative 7305 pI am new to JS, HTML and CSS development and I tried to develop a hovering function for my webpage. However, I am facing the problem that nothing is being displayed when hovering over the links and the divs created for the specific hovering textboxes are appearing on the page even if not hovering.p  pI used The code fragments below to reach this. First I have some CSS this should be generic, so I can use it for different hover divs. I am not sure, if I wrote everything correctly. Secondly, I have a JS code for the hovering function. Then you see the divs I created for the different hover textboxes. These divs appear on the webpage even if not hovering. Do I need further if statements to indicate that these should only be displayed when hovering. Lastly, I added the link I use. Maybe someone could also tell me how I can bring away the blue part of the link, but this is currently only a minor problem.p  pFirst the CSS code Could you tell me the error I am doing here probably I want this code to be generic as well.

Negative 7305 pFrom emUsing the FreeRTOS Real Time Kernel  Standard Edition, p143em, I noticed thatp  blockquote   pint types are never used  only long and shortp blockquote  pI would like to know why, but I find no answer in its official site and no result after google.p  pstrongUpdate 0831strongp  pMaybe my question is not so clear, in short, I just wonder that why FreeRTOS defines codeBaseTypetcode as codelongcode instead of codeintcodeand other FreeRTOS defined types are never use codeintcode, too. From its a hrefhttpwww.freertos.orgFreeRTOSCodingStandardandStyleGuide.htmlDataTypes relnofollowCodingStandardandStyleGuidea page, it said thatp  blockquote   pBaseTypetp      pThis is defined to be the most efficient, natural, type for the architecture. For example, on a 32bit architecture BaseTypet will be defined to be a 32bit type. On a 16bit architecture BaseTypet will be defined to be a 16bit type. If BaseTypet is define to char then particular care must be taken to ensure signed chars are used for function return values that can be negative to indicate an error.p blockquote  pFrom the above description, I think codeintcode is more suitable than codelongcode, since codeintcode is always conform to the architectures word size.p

Negative 7305 pIm currently learning about the Java Memory Model, and how it affects the reorderings that a compiler may make. However, Im a bit confused about external operations. The JMM defines them as an action that may be observable outside of on operation. Going off of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26788260examplesforthreaddivergenceactionsandexternalactionsinthejavamemorymthis questiona, I understand external actions to be things like printing a value, writing to a file, network operations, etc.p  pNow, how are external actions affected by reordering I think its obvious that an external action cannot be reordered with another external action, as this will change the observable behaviour of the program and thus is not a valid transformation according to the JMM. But what about reordering an external action with a normal memory access, or a synchronisation action For examplep  precodevolatile int v  5 int x  v System.out.println codepre  pCan the print and codeint x  vcode be reordered here I cant see it changing behaviour, but the read of volatile v is the same as a monitor acquire, so I dont think the reordering is valid.p

Negative 7305 pI have been experimenting with abstract types.

My question is if theres a way I can implement this where the user of codemanagercode doesnt ever have to deal with pointers or codenewcode.p  precodefoo.addderived example codepre  pMy attempts to implement this end up asp  precodeclass manager  vectorltsharedptrltbasegtgt ptrs public  void addbaseamp ref   ptrs.emplacebackampref    codepre  pBut, the compiler says codeno known conversion from derived to baseampcode. I have no idea how to make a reference to codebasecode compatible with a reference to codederivedcode. How do I get around thisp
