Positive 4278 pI have been programming with PHP and MySQL for about a year now and I am going to have a go at my first large scale project. I am currently trying to play how I will structure the whole site database and I am running into a couple of issues to do with structure. Just for brevity Ill describe it as a social network for gamers. p  pSo each player will have a list of favourite games, and those games will have unique properties. In this site each user in the users table will have multiple games. Im trying to figure out what is the best way to approach thisp  ul liIs it best to store multiple games in a string that can be downloaded and parsed, and then a table of each individual games li liShall I have a table of users, a table of favourite games and a table of games with their attributes. And if I do it this way should I have a user as each row and then a string that could be parsed into a list, or should i have each row as 1 user and 1 game then run a search and return the rows when needed.li ul  pAs you can probably tell Im just getting confused with how to handle database structures. Any and all advice would be appreciated, thank you very much for reading this.p

Positive 4278 pBackground information I have a JVC GYHM600 Video camera where I recorded 3 hours of a Dance recital. It was recorded onto a Sony Mico SD 64 GB card. The video was recorded in the AVCHD format, this is a specific file  folder structure where the actual video files are files with the extention .mts under a folder named Stream.p  pPast actions I transcoded this video into .MOV files with Apples Final Cut Pro version 6 and successfully created an Final Cut Pro project.p  pFuture intentions My intention is to save this SD card with a copy of my Final cut Pro project file so that I can clear out all files on my IMAC to recover space and , if needed, reload  recreate the original project anytime in the future.p  pWhat happened I plugged this card into my USB SD card reader to visit files stored on this card and I started encountering file IO errors. I ejected the disk  chip, plugged it back in and instead of the name on the disk as seen in the finder window I saw the name as Untitled. The disk  chip had no files stored on it. The SD card used on a different camera my front camera worked perfectly. FYI Front camera chip was Scan Disk, bad one was Sony.p  pWhat I want to do Rercreate te entire AVCHD file structure on a new SD card using the transcoded .mov files still on my IMAC drive.  Why I want to do this. The size of the .mov files transcoded will not fit on a 64 gb card. The AVCHD format transcodes into uncompresed files with no apparent loss of quality. I know of no other compressed format that Final Cut Pro can transcode so well.p  pThanks for any help in this matter.p

Negative 4278 pI have a Rails application that Im in the process of designing.  I have a separate model that needs to link to only 2 of one model.  Specifically, my evaluations have 2 members, an evaluator, and an evaluatee.  They also have a few other pieces of information, too but they should not be relevant to this.  p  pWhat is the best way to represent this  Would 2 foreign keys in the evaluation be best, or a manymany relationship between the evaluations and the members  Would there be some other option that would work even better  p  pI would initially think many to many, but since there is a defined number on one side of the relationship I question the applicability here.  To my knowledge, manytomany generally implies that the number on each side of the relation is variable.p

Can the database be forced to run in memory only  When writing the packet data, can the data packet byte array be written in one statement rather than iteratively inserting each byteword  I suppose I could turn it into a string but I expect that would make it nearly impossible to query with any speed.  I dont see any mention of anything like a byte array type in any of the databases I briefly looked at.  FWIW All the data is coming up to a dedicated NIC on a static IP.  The packets are sequential I know its not guaranteed with UDP but Ive never seen one out of order yet I could stride through the data easily if the database supported an array type.

Negative 4278 pIm in the process of designing an iPhone app, using Core Data for data persistence with local SQLite store[s].  Before I get too far into the implementation, Im hoping for some qualitative advice on some basic design questions relating to Core Data.p  pHeres the scenariop  ul lipThe app handles data on dozens possibly hundreds of Students  EACH with several Hundred individual items of data numbers and text.pli lipMost of the time, the user of the app will be accessingmodifying information on one student at a time.pli lipOccasionally, theyll pop back to a directory view, which shows a list of all students to choose from.pli ul  pSo heres the first big design questionp  pCORE DATA STORESp  pIn such an application, whats the most reasonable approach to storing all this data with a single data store, or perhaps multiple storesp  pApproach 1  Would be using ONE data store for all the information on ALL the students.p  pApproach 2  Use of MULTIPLE stores, one for each student. Remember that theres hundreds of items of data on each and every one.p  pApproach 3  Perhaps a hybrid approach  Multiple stores, one for each student, with a separate index file used to associate basic metadata on all students with the filename of each students individual store.p  pp  p Assuming for a moment, approach 2 This means simplicity when accessing a particular students data.  However, in order to generate the directory screen which lists all students, Id need to iterate through each of the stores to tabulate the information needed to assemble that list first name, last name, and a few other items for each person  so using just each stores filename to represent that metadata isnt sufficient, or desirable.p  pIn this case, Id need to OPEN each of the stores, retrieve the students basic metadata, then close it up again amp move to the next file.p  pIs this inefficient  Is it expensive to openclose potentially dozens or hundreds of individual storesp  p[In fact, Id already started in with approach 2, but have gotten hung up in iterating across multiple stores to create that directory view  hence, Im wondering if its a reasonable approach to begin with.  p  pThe potential considerations included keeping the size of each file manageable the design of the object graph a little simpler and also to minimize the potential for data loss if a store should somehow become corrupt  but Im not sure how much of a practical issue that really is.]p  pCORE DATA STACKSp  p Next, and again assuming approach 2  How to actually do thatp  pTo openreadclose a particular store, should I reuse a singleton Context ... Coordinator  i.e., first, Remove any opened store from that Context, Add the next store, and iterate through that way  Or release amp reconstruct the stack for each store I need to iterate throughp  pOne possible consideration would be to eliminate the potential of commingling data between files.p  pAnd which of these operations are expensivep  p... Or would it much simpler just to use one largeish store to handle all data in the first place  Op  pp  pAnyway, I realize this is an elaborate question, but any guidance would be VERY much appreciated.p  pI also hope this helps others using Core Data for their apps as well.p  pTHANK YOU so much in advancep
Negative 4278 pIve been reading emJava Concurrency in Practiceem lately  great book.

Negative 4278 pIm building a new website which has one core application and many content pages. Content pages are mostly dynamic and I require a way to manage this dynamic content on a regular basis. The core applications main functionality is a 3 step process or reading user data input page, reading data from MySQL product page and submitting an application to an email address application page.p  pIdeally I would like to build the core application in regular PHP and leverage Drupal for its content management capabilities. Can Drupal and regular PHP be integrated as I suggest easily My feeling is that coding the core application as a Drupal modules will add layers of complexity that could be difficult to code from the outset and maintain later on as the system matures  so I would really like to just use regular PHP.p  pLet me explain where dynamic content managed by the CMS intersects with the core application p  pDynamic content such as FAQ data is used both on the normal help pages and also within a minifeed displayed within core application pages down a right hand side column. In this column, 3 random questions are pulled from the database and displayed as a feed. When users click on FAQ question they are not taken away from the core application product page but are instead shown data in a popup window displaying the question and answer. In addition, users can browse other questions and answers through a simple navigation menu within this popup. There are 3 such like feeds as I describe above that I require on the core application product page.p  pSo, what is the ideal solution here in terms of keeping things simple for both the management of dynamic content and the ease of coding the core application Can regular PHP and Drupal coexist peacefully If so, how is this technically possible strongBecause there is some content managed by Drupal contained within core application pages, can the core application still be coded in regular PHPstrongp  pAny advice  suggestions  Thank you Jim.p

Negative 4278 pIm not too informed on the nitty gritty of modifying the responder chain, so if this is stupid pls dont bash me p  pbasically i have 2 view stacksblue as a subview of a parent viewredp  pthey are both occupying the full frame of parent at one point in time, so obviously only the one on top is getting touch events, which travel upstream to the parent viewred and on to window.p  pDuring some cases i want the touch input to be picked up by the eligible child view of other view stack. That is, the view that woud be receiving these inputs if the current topmost view had userinteractionenabled set to no.p  pSetting userinteractionenabled works but i feel like its a dirty hack. The gist is this topmot view is mostly transparent and i want the events when touched in the specified region to end up on the other stack.p  phere is a picture to help visually explain, and keep in mind both blue views are 100 of parent.p  pa hrefhttpc.crap.ps35a5 relnofollowhttpc.crap.ps35a5ap

Negative 4278 pI am working on a small task which requires some base64 encoding. I am trying to do it in head but getting lost . p  pI have a 13 digit number in java long format say 1294705313608 , 1294705313594 , 1294705313573p  pI do some processing with it, bascially I take this number append it with stuff put it in a byte array and then convert it to base64 usingp  precodeString b64String  new sun.misc.BASE64Encoder.encodeBufferbArray codepre  pNow , I know that for my original number, the first 3 digits would never change.

I ignore the first 2 bytes since they are always 0p  pbArray[0]  byte time  40br     bArray[1]  byte time  32br     bArray[2]  byte time  24br     bArray[3]  byte time  16br     bArray[4]  byte time  8br     bArray[5]  byte time  0p  pThanks.p  pNotes I know that base64 would take 6 bits and make one character out of it.

Negative 4278 h2OVERVIEWh2  pIm working on a project and Ive come across a bit of a problem in that things arent happening in the order I want them to happen. So I have been thinking about designing some kind of Queue that I can use to organize function calls and other miscellaneous JavaScriptjQuery instructions used during startup, i.e., while the page is loading. What Im looking for doesnt necessarily need to be a Queue data structure but some system that will ensure that things execute in the order I specify and only when the previous task has been completed can the new task begin.p  pIve briefly looked at the a hrefhttpapi.jquery.comqueue relnofollowjQuery Queuea and the a hrefhttpdocs.jquery.comAjaxQueue relnofollowAjaxQueuea but I really have no idea how they work yet so Im not sure if that is the approach I want to take... but Ill keep reading more about these tools.p  h2SPECIFICSh2  pCurrently, I have set things up so that some work happens inside codedocument.readyfunction ...code and other work happens inside codewindow.loadfunction ...code. For example,p  precodeltheadgt   ltscript typetextjavascriptgt           I want this to happen 1st     .LoadJavaScript      ... do some basic configuration for the stuff that needs to happen later...       I want this to happen 2nd     document.readyfunction          ... do some work that depends on the previous work do have been completed       var script  document.createElementscript        ... do some more work...            I want this to happen 3rd     window.loadfunction          ... do some work that depends on the previous work do have been completed       .InitializeSymbols       .InitializeBlock        ... other work ... etc...        ltscriptgt ltheadgt codepre  p... and this is really tedious and ugly, not to mention bad design. So instead of dealing with that mess, I want to design a pretty versatile system so that I can, for example, enqueue code.LoadJavaScriptcode, then codevar script  document.createElementscriptcode, then code.InitializeSymbolscode, then code.InitializeBlockcode, etc... and then the Queue would execute the function calls and instructions such that after one instruction is finished executing, the other can start, until the Queue is empty instead of me calling dequeue repeatedly.p  pThe reasoning behind this is that some work needs to happen, like configuration and initialization, before other work can begin because of the dependency on the configuration and initialization steps to have completed. If this doesnt sound like a good solution, please let me know p  h2SOME BASIC WORKh2  pIve written some code for a basic Queue, a hrefhttphristo.oskov.comwpcontentuploads201101Queue.js relnofollowwhich can be found herea, but Im looking to expand its functionality so that I can store various types of Objects, such as individual JavaScriptjQuery instructions and function calls, essentially pieces of code that I want to execute.p  pemstrongUPDATEemstrongp  pWith the current Queue that Ive implemented, it looks like I can store functions and execute them later, for examplep  precode a JS file...  .fn.LoadJavaScript  function       .getScriptjsSymbolsSymbol.js     .getScriptjsStructuresStructure.js    another JS file... function init   symbols and structures    index.html var theQueue  new Queue theQueue.enqueue.LoadJavaScript theQueue.enqueueinit  var LJS  theQueue.dequeue var INIT  theQueue.dequeue  LJS INIT codepre  pI also think Ive figured out how to store individual instructions, such as codeequation.htmlcode or perhaps even ifelse statements or loops, by wrapping them as suchp  precodetheQueue.enqueuefunction  equation.html  other instructions, etc...  codepre  pBut this approach would require me to wait until the Queue is done with its work before I can continue doing my work. This seems like an incorrect design. Is there a more clever approach to this Also, how can I know that a certain function has completed executing so that the Queue can know to move on Is there some kind of return value that I can wait for or a callback function that I can specify to each task in the Queuep  h2WRAPUPh2  pSince Im doing everything clientside and I cant have the Queue do its own thing independently according to an answer below, is there a more clever solution than me just waiting for the Queue to finish its workp  pSince this is more of a design question than a specific code question, Im looking for suggestions on an approach to solving my problem, advice on how I should design this system, but I definitely welcome, and would love to see, code to back up the suggestions  I also welcome any criticism regarding the Queue.js file Ive linked to above andor my description of my problem and the approach Im planning to take to resolve it.p  pThanks, Hristop
Negative 4278 pI have an C application that performance ETL process.

In addition, the database runs on the same machine as the application.p  pEvent the application closes all its database connections, it would timeout again if it runs ETL process the next time. If I run the sql manually using SQL Manager Studio, it has no problem at all.p  pThanksp  pUPDATE  The application is turning off a number of constraints. It turns out the time out only happens to 1 particular constraint. This constraint is referencing to the Date Dimension table.p  pUPDATE  It looks like there is some weird abnormality for the testing database that I was working. I tried the same ETL process with other data warehouse and it has no problem so far. Other developers in the team also havent encounter this issue. This application runs on every midnight. I will keep it running overnight and hopefully I can reproduce the same issue on other databases. So far no luck on figuring out what is going on.p

Negative 4278 pI have written a word game using HTML5 canvas tag and a little bit of audio. I developed the application on the chrome web browser on a linux system. Recently during the testing phase it was tried on safari 5.0.3 on Mac and the webpage froze. Not just the canvas element, but interactive element on the page froze. I have at some times experienced this problem on google chrome when I was developing but since the console did not throw any error before this happened, I did not give it much credence. Now as per requirements I am supposed to support both chrome and safari but this dismal performance on safari has left me shocked and I cannot see what error can be thrown which might lead to such a situation. Worse yet the CPU usage on using this application peaks to 7080percent on my 2yr old macbook running ubuntu... I can only but pity the person who uses mac to operate this app, which undoubtedly is a heavier OS. Could someone help me out with a place I can start with to find out what exactly is causing this issue.p  pI have run profiles on this webapp on google chromes console and noticed that in the heap spanshot value increases steadily with the playing of the game, specifically root value which jumps up by 900 counts. Any help would be very appreciatedp  pThanksp  pEDIT I dont know if this helps, but I have noticed that even on refreshing the page after the app becomes unresponsive the page reloads and I am still not able to interact with the page elements but the tab scroll bar continues to work and I can see my application window completely. So to summaries the tab stops accepting any sort of user interaction inside the page.p  pEdit2 Nop. It doesnt work still... The app crashes on double click on the canvas element. The console is not throwing any errors either  I have noticed this problem is isolated only to safarip  pEdit3 Okay, so I performed some other tests today. I isolated the HTML5 widget and its HTML data only and ran it on safari locally to reproduce the error. Alas it works well So I tried playing the game from my server without Facebook integration, and it works fine again So The issue crops up only on safari on MAC OSX, while the widget is on Facebook canvas as a Facebook application. I am very hardpressed to come up with a reduced test case scenario for this app...  It gets weirder, the game works well on safari for windows. Also after the tab freezes the other tabs continue to be responsive and well working. This tab too closes on clicking the close button and stuff, but if I load another page on this same tab after its frozen the page loads in the tab canvas, but I cannot interact with it. Not even google.com So I am sure there is no bug with my game but its a safari bug... Will soon file a bug report, thanks for all the help people... p

Negative 4278 pI am writing an app for android. The app has many graphics moving around a canvas. If two meet they explode. In a nutshell, I have a nice couple of graphics for explosions, however the nature of an explosion is that it only lasts for a split seocnd, or a little longer, and I need to program the explosiongraphic to show on the screen and then disappear. I have some clumsy code to implement this.p  precode  public void flickerExplosion                  flickercounter                 ifflickercounter 100                      flickercounter  0                                     explodegraphic.deleteGraphic                                               ifflickercounter10gt4                          explodegraphic.setBitmapBitmapFactory.decodeResourcegetResources, R.drawable.exp1                                            elseexplodegraphic.setBitmapBitmapFactory.decodeResourcegetResources, R.drawable.exp2               codepre  pIn the code, explodegraphic is a class for holding a bitmap which is drawn on the canvas by onDraw. After incrementing 100 times the explosion graphic goes away. The explosion flickers between two bitmaps exp1, exp2. The code works OK. I realize I could have used a timer, orother such class increment. But my question is about a strongniggling feeling Im wasting resources with flickercounterstrong, which is a class int variable. For iterating things like this, is it possible to use anon inner functions i.e. closures If so would that make the class variable flickercounter obsolete and make my program more efficient I ask this as someone who only started learning about closures a week ago.p

Negative 4278 pFor storing WP7appdata it would be great if it was possible to use the current users live account. Is this possible somehow I guess not. The alternative is for me to setup my own server to store the data, which means I also will have to implement accountmanagement and require the user to create a new login and password for my perticular appsite. This is not very practical as the user allready has a live account on the phone. A compromise would be if I could use the logged in liveaccount on the phone as some kind of token to validate that the logged in user is who heshe pretends to be, and then store the data on my website.

Negative 4278 pIve been told a few times that its bad to use exceptions in javascript.

I have a case where I have iterator functions nested in each other, each one returns the next value on call, so I use an exception to indicate that theres nothing more to iterate  seems like a logical way to do it, makes the code clean and works perfectly in practice. Is there really any reason not to use exceptions in jsp  pSecond question, when Im using exceptions, what kind of objects should I throw For errors Ill obviously throw instances of Error, but for special cases stop iteration, etc I needed a quick way to check for those specific exceptions, and what I did is simply define an empty named function function StopIteration and since functions are compared by reference I can always check if its my special case or I should just rethrow.

Negative 4278 pI have a phpmysql application, part of which allows the user to upload a csv file. The steps in the process are as followsp  ol liUser uploads a file, and it gets parsed to check for validityli liIf the file is valid, the parsed information is displayed, along with options for the user to match columns from the csv file to database columnsli liImport the data  final stage where the csv data is actually imported into the databaseli ol  pSo, the problem that I have at this point is that the same csv file gets parsed in each of the above 3 steps  so that means 3 parses for each import. p  pGiven that there can be up to 500 rows per csv file, then this doesnt strike me as particularly efficient. p  pShould I rather temporarily store the imported information in a database table after step 1 If so, I would obviously run clear up routines to keep the table as clean as possible. The one downside is that the csv imports can contain between 2 and 10 columns  so Id have to make a database table of at least 11 columns with an ID field...which would be somewhat redundant in most cases.p  pOr should I just stick with the csv parsing Up to 500 rows is quite small...p  pOr perhaps there is another better alternativep

Negative 4278 pI am building a dynamic query as a stored procedure in SQL Server 2008 and Im getting some unexpected results when I compare a date supplied as a parameter and a datetime stored in the database. I searched around for some ways to compare the two without taking the time portion into consideration and found thisp  precodeDATEDIFFday, d, v.ScheduledDate  0 codepre  pWhat Im doing with this is trying to find records where the supplied date parameter and the stored ScheduledDate are the same in terms of days, e.g. 02052011 and strong02052011strong 112619.157. This is query that I wrote to do thisp  precodeSET sql  SELECT e.Id, e.FirstName, e.LastName, v.ScheduledDate             FROM Employee e, Visit v             WHERE 11  Several IF IS NOT NULL statements here  IF d IS NOT NULL BEGIN   SET sql  sql   AND DATEDIFFday,   d  ,  v.ScheduledDate  0   AND v.EmpId  e.Id  END EXEC sql codepre  pI would expect that this query would result in the all of the ScheduledDates for any employee who has a visit scheduled for that day. In other words, if I have two employees with Ids 5 and 7, and there exists in the Visit table two ScheduleDate entries on 02052011 for employees with Ids 5 and 7, I would expect to get both those employees back when I run this query. It seems, however, that when I run it, I only get one row back. As a side note, the two ScheduledDate entries Im working with are on the same day, but about 3 hours apart from each other. I would think that the DATEDIFF function would account for this, since a few hours is certainly within the time frame of a day. If I change the  in the query to a  0 or a lt 0, I get more rows as expected, but oddly enough still only get the single entry for that specific date. There are other records in the table where the same Employee has multiple visits on different dates, and those are returned accordingly when I use  0 or lt 0. For example, Employee with Id 41 has 3 visits on 10292011, 11242011, and 12282011 and all 3 of those are returned when I change DATEDIFF to  0. Im still confused as to why Im only getting back the single record when two different Employees have a visit scheduled on the same date. Could anyone provide some insight as to where my logic is going wrong here Note that when Im testing this, Im only supplying the ScheduledDate parameter. All of the other IF IS NOT NULL statements just fall through since all other params are inserted as NULL.p

Negative 4278 pOK I have looked and looked and I think I am missing something about custom keyboards and inserting text into a codeUITextFieldcode.  Like many people I am creating a codeUIViewcode custom keyboard with my own set of key caps on custom codeUIButtonscode.  I then assign this view to the UITextFields codeinputViewcode and then my keyboard pops up when that text field becomes the first responder.  Internal to the keyboard I capture button actions and translate them to what would be keystrokes.p  pBut from here I am puzzled about how to best send my keystrokes to the text field.  I have seen plenty of examples like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7140770ioscustomkeyboardupdatingtextfieldinparentviewiOS Custom Keyboard Updating Text Field In Parent Viewa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3224757returninputstouitextfieldwithcustominputviewReturn Inputs To UITextfield With Custom Inputviewa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4788937howtopushkeyvalueintouitextviewfromcustomkeyboardiniosHow To Push Key Value Into UITextView From Custom Keyboard In iOSa where the solution seems to be to embed a pointer to the target codeUITextFieldcode inside the custom view.  p  pThis does not seem right to me, as for multiple codeUITextFieldscode either I have to have to manually change references on a single custom keyboard  whenever a new text field becomes the first responder, or I have to carry around a matching  custom keyboard for each text field I want to support.p  pIt seems to me that a keyboard should just translate touches into tokens and send those tokens up the line to be interpreted by whoever receives them first responder.  a hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com1063ipadforiphonedevelopers101custominputviewtutorialiPad For iPhone Developers 101 Custom Input View Tutoriala seems to do this, but creates a custom protocol to do so.  I imagine actually a SWAG  Scientific Wild Arsed Guess that the standard iOS keyboards operate like that, but use a specific protocol to pass along the keystrokes.  So what I want to be able to do is to manually generate the same chain of eventsmessages that the standard keyboard does.p  pSo how can I do this  Or can I even do this with public APIs  Or is the operation of the standard keyboards bound too tightly to the UITextFieldp

Negative 4278 pFirst of all, Im still familiarizing myself with multithreading, and dont know much terminology. I need to make sure Im doing this right, because its a sensitive subject.p  pstrongSpecificationsstrongp  pWhat Im building is a component which will contain a dynamic number of threads. Each of these threads is reused for performing a number of requests. I can provide all necessary details to the thread as I create it and before I execute it, as well as provide event handlers. Once its executed, Im pretty much done with one request, and I feed in another request. The requests are being fed into these threads from another standalone background thread which is constantly processing a queue of requests. So this system has two lists 1 List of request records, and 2 List of thread pointers.p  pIm using descendants of the codeTThreadcode class at least this is the threading method Im familiar with. Im getting feedback from the threads by synchronizing event triggers which I assigned when the threads were created. The threads are loading and saving data in the background, and when theyre done, they reset themselves ready to process the next request.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pNow the trouble begins when deciding how to handle the event of changing the number of allowed threads via a property of the component codeActiveThreads TActiveThreadRangecode which codeTActiveThreadRangecode  1..20. Therefore, there can be anywhere between 1 and 20 threads created at a time. But when, lets say, the application using this component changes this property from 5 to 3. At this time, there are already 5 threads created, and I dont want to forcefully free that thread if it happens to be busy. I need to wait until its done before I free it. And on the other hand, if the property is changed from 3 to 5, then I need to create 2 new threads. I need to know the proper approach to keep track of these threads in this scenario.p  pstrongPossibilitiesstrongp  pHere are some possible ways I can think of to track these threads...p  ul liKeep a codeTListcode containing each created thread  easy to manageli liCreate a codeTListcode wrapper or descendant containing each created thread  easier to manage, but more workli liKeep an codearraycode containing each created thread  Would this be better than a codeTListcodeli liCreate an array wrapper containing each created threadli ul  pBut then back to my original issue  What to do with existing busy threads when the codeActiveThreadscode property is decreased Creating them is no problem, but releasing them is becoming confusing. I usually make threads which free themselves, but this is the first time Ive made one which is reused. I just need to know the proper method of destroying these threads without interrupting their tasks.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pBased on the feedback, I have acquired and begun implementing the OmniThreadLibrary as well as the long needed FastMM. Ive also changed my approach a little  A way that I can create these threaded processes without managing them and without another thread to process the queue...p  ul li1 master method to spawn a new process  ul licodefunction NewProcessconst Request TProcessRequest TProcessInfocodeli licodeTProcessRequestcode is a record with specifications of whats to be done Filename, Options, etc.li licodeTProcessInfocode is a record which passes back some status information.li ulli liFeed in an event handler for the event of being done with its task when creating a new process. When component receives this message, it will check the queue. ul liIf command is queued, it will compare the active process limit with current process countli li If exceeds limit, just stop and next completed process will do perform same checkli li If within limit, kick off another new process after ensuring previous process is doneli liIf no commands are queued, then just stopli ulli liEach process can die on its own after it has done its task no keepalive threadingli liI wont have to worry about another timer or thread to continually loop through  ul liInstead each process destroys its self and checks for new requests before doing soli ulli ul  pstrongAnother Updatestrongp  pI have actually reverted back to using a codeTThreadcode, as the OTL is very uncomfortable to use. I like to keep things wrapped and organized in its own class.p

Negative 4278 pI would like to know some interesting challenges based on distributed systems that could be solved within the time frame of a quarter my university follows quarter system.

Negative 4278 pIm trying to do some fairly simple hideshow of divs using prototype.js. The page is working completely correctly in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari, but one specific part wont work in IE the initial hiding of divs. The page has three divs, and the javascript is written so that you can switch between them, with only one being displayed at a time. This part works fine in IE too, but for some reason, when the page is first loaded, it shows all 3 divs. Ive tried many things to hide them, leaving me with this current incarnationp  pThe relevant HTMLp  precode    ltdiv classlinkbargt         lta classnormal hrefJavaScriptvoid secmapgtMapltagtltbrgtltbrgt         lta classnormal hrefJavaScriptvoid sectourgtTourltagtltbrgtltbrgt         lta classnormal hrefJavaScriptvoid secvidgtVideosltagtltbrgtltbrgt     ltdivgt  ltdiv classbggt     ltdiv classsection idmap secmapgt         ...html here...     ltdivgt     ltdiv classsection idtour sectourgt         ...html here...     ltdivgt     ltdiv classsection idvid secvidgt         ...html here...     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe relevant Javascriptp  precode document.observedomloaded, function      showSectionmap     var currSection  map      a.normal.eachfunctionp         Event.observep,click,function             var hr  this.readAttributesec             showSectionhr             currSection  hr                    function showSectionsectionname         div.section.eachfunctiond             d.hide                  sectionname.show        ltscriptgt codepre  pSo in IE, as soon as I choose any of the links, it correctly hides the divs and then opens the correct one, which would indicate to me that its able to find and hide the divs. However, when I first load the page in IE, it doesnt hide anything. Thoughts on why this is happeningp  pEDIT Upon further research, Im thinking this may relate to issues with IE and checking for DOM loading.p

Negative 4278 pI got PostgreSQL 9.1 from the official distro, not the builtin version to install and talk nicely to a browser in MacOS Lion. However I cant get it to work with ODBC. I installed XCode in order to have the required libltdl.3.dylib, and also the psqlODBC driver. I then made a symlink in usrliblibltdl.3.dylib so that psqlODBC would find the library. psqlODBC is registered in iodbcinst.ini. However, when I try to open a connection, I get two different errors.

Negative 4278 pIm currently trying to make a register form using mongoDB and nodeJS  Ive created new database and collection  I want to store username, password, email and inserttime in my database.p  pIve added unique indexes to usernameemail and checked if it works  and I can not add a duplicated entry using mongos console or rockmongo php mongodb manager  so it works fine.p  pHowever  when the piece of code that is supposed to register a new account is being executed and makes an insert with the data that is already in database  it returns an object that contains all the data that was supposed to be added with a new, unique id. The point is  it should return an error that would say that entries can not be duplicated and insert failed  instead it returns the data back and gives it a new id. Data that already resides in database remains untouched  even the ID stays the same  its not rewritten with the new one returned by scripts insert.p  pSo, the question is... what am I doing wrong Or maybe everything is fine and databases insert should return data even if its failed...p  pI even tried defining indexes before executing indexes. I tried inserting the data using mongoDBs default functions and a hrefhttpsgithub.comgettmongojsmongoJSa functions  the result is the same in both cases.p  pThe code Im trying to execute for a hrefhttpsgithub.comgettmongojsmongoJSap  precodevar dbconn  requiremongojs.connect127.0.0.127017db, [users]  var register  functioneveryone, params, callback       TODO validation      dbconn.users.ensureIndexusername1,uniquetrue     dbconn.users.ensureIndexemail1,uniquetrue      dbconn.users.save              username params.username,         password params.password,         email params.email,         inserttime Date.now     ,     functionerror, saved              iferror  saved                      callbackfalse                  else                      console.logerror             console.logsaved             callbacktrue                codepre  pFor both cases  inserting new data and inserting duplicated data that doesnt modify database in any way  ERROR is null and SAVED is just a copy of data that is supposed to be inserted.

Negative 4278 pIve got this code from a hrefhttpmadskristensen.netpostJavaScriptAlertShow28e2809dmessagee2809d29fromASPNETcodebehind.aspx relnofollowMads Kristensens bloga to display a message box on an ASP.NET clients page using Javascriptp  precodepublic static class Alert      public static void Showstring message               Cleans the message to allow single quotation marks          string cleanMessage  message.Replace,          string script  ltscript typetextjavascriptgtalert  cleanMessage  ltscriptgt           Gets the executing web page          Page page  PageHttpContext.Current.CurrentHandler           Checks if the handler is a Page and that the script isnt allready on the Page          if page  null ampamp page.ClientScript.IsClientScriptBlockRegisteredalert                      page.ClientScript.RegisterClientScriptBlocktypeofAlert, alert, script, false                codepre  pAnd it works fine when there is no master page involved.

Negative 4278 pEven if I associate the button with a class derived from codeICommandcode, I am still left with figuring out how the button should trigger the codeCanExecutecode method and refresh its enabled state. I do know about the codeCanExecuteChangedcode event for which a button with an associated command registers, but see the following paragraph for why this is troublesome.p  pOn a plain old dialog consisting of some 1015 controls, it seems haphazard to have to process every change notification for every single one of those controls, triggering the codeCanExecuteChangedcode event on the buttons command, causing the buttons enabled state to be affected by the codeCanExecutecode methods return value. Even stating what needs to be done in the last sentence was quite cumbersome. p  pThere must be a better way of coding a WPF dialog, so that the confirmation button e.g., OK is grayed out until all controls have valid information and is enabled at that point in time i.e., when all controls are properly filled in. Sample code, ideas and pointers to articles would be immensely appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 4278 pI want to dop  precodemasked  image  mask codepre  pBut I want to displace codemaskcode. That is, move it vertically and horizontally as long as the intersection between it and codeimagecode is not empty, this would be valid.p  pI have some handcoded assembly which uses MMX instructions which does this, embedded in a C program, but its unstable when doing vertical displacement, so I thought of using OpenCV instead. Would it be possible to do this calling only one OpenCV function p  pPerformance is critical using OpenCV, time should be at least in the same order of magnitude as the assembly code.p  pstrongEDITstrong Heres an examplep  pcodeimagecode medium frame, see the contrast in the guys skullp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4UOyem.png altImagep  pcodemaskcode first frame, no contrastp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvXatNm.png altenter image description herep  pcodeimage  maskcode, without displacement.

Negative 4278 pI have a server, and a client.p  pA client sends a request. The request has a certain key associated with it, e.g. codea1code, codea2code, codeb1code, codeb4code.p  pIf two requests for the same key come in at once, there will be a conflict error, as the same data structures are being modified.p  pI can adapt the client to simply not send two requests of the same key at once. However, Id like this system to work with multiple clients, too. It seems silly to have the clients coordinate what they send to the server. Instead, Id like the server to simply block on a request of a certain key if that key is already being modified, until the other requests with that same key are done.p  pTo this end, Ive created a locking system. At the beginning of the function on the server, I dop  precodekey  ... print Acquiring s lock...  key, KEYLOCKS[key].acquire print s lock acquired.  key, def aftercommithooksuccess     KEYLOCKS[key].release     print after s commit Released s lock  failed, successful[success], key transaction.get.addAfterCommitHookaftercommithook codepre  pwhere codeKEYLOCKScode is a dict mapping keys to codethreading.Lockcodes. Afterwards follows the code that modifies the persistent data structures.p  pWhat I assume would happen is that, if a request comes in for a key thats already being processed, it would block when acquiring the lock. Only when the earlier request stronghas already been committedstrong thus being beyond any conflict errors, would the new request resume. The requests do nothing that would conflict until the lock is acquired.p  pMost of the requests work finep  precodeAcquiring ab lock... ab lock acquired. after successful commit Released ab lock Acquiring ac lock... ac lock acquired. after successful commit Released ac lock codepre  pHowever, there is emstillem an issue when the same key is sent, even though the locking seems to workp  precodeAcquiring qq lock... qq lock acquired.

ConflictError database conflict error oid 0x13009b, class persistent.list.PersistentList codepre  pAnd then the request retries. Note that the codeqq lockcode was only acquired after the successful commit. p  pWhat gives Why is this system not preventing conflict errors Where is my assumption incorrectp  hr  pEDIT Well, if, before the codetransaction.get.addAfterCommitHookaftercommithookcode line I put codetransaction.begincode, it works. For the life of me I cant figure out why. Before the codetransaction.begincode line, the entirety of my code isp  precodepost  request.params if not post return ResponseNo data  data  evalpost[data] timeparsed  time.time  myapp  request.context codepre  pThis solves my problem but Im not putting that as an answer cause I still want to know Why does it give conflict errors if I dont start a fresh transaction right beforep

Negative 4278 pIm creating a 3D multiplayer game with Three.js, where players can join various existing games. Once play is clicked, the renderer is appended to the page and fullscreens. This works great, but the problem is that, when I exit the fullscreen, it still stays appended. Id like to remove it, but I dont know whenp  pSo, basically, Im looking for an event that says this element exited fullscreen.p  pThis is how I append the renderer to the pagep  precodecontainer  document.getElementByIdcontainer document.body.appendChildcontainer  var renderer  new THREE.WebGLRendererantialias true renderer.setSize WIDTH, HEIGHT container.appendChild renderer.domElement  codepre  pThis if how I fullscreen itp  precodeTHREEx.FullScreen.requestcontainer  renderer.setSizescreen.width, screen.height codepre  pAlso, is there a way to stop that annoying header from appearing whenever someone points his mouse to the top of the page And, I guess I can just prevent escape from doing what it does exiting fullscreen in Firefox and Chrome with codepreventDefaultcodep  pAnd, also, does anyone know why is Firefox so much slower than Chrome in 3D rendering I mean, Im using WebGL, this means that the GPU is being usedp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe fullscreenchange event is indeed fired, but it has different names under different browsers. For example, on Chrome its called webkitfullscreenchange, and on Firefox its mozfullscreenchange.p

Negative 4278 pIm having the weirdest problem ever when programming in C. My function sometimes runs and other times it doesnt, and even though I tried searching for these errors stack smashing detected and no source for getenv I cant seem to find the answer to why it fails sometimes. I tried debugging it and it only has a problem in the last character a , so it runs all those other functions and they have been tested a lot separately but sometimes it just falls apart and doesnt run the last function it works, that I can guarantee, because some other times it even runs inside this function. Also the few last times I ran the function it gave Segmentation Fault even though sometimes it ran all the way to the end.

Negative 4278 pSuppose my Azure role stores some data on the VM local disk and is then terminated.

Negative 4278 pIm writing a TCP server. Everything it has to do is to readwrite text tofrom TCP sockets and readwrite this text tofrom text files on the file system where the server runs.p  pIf theres a problem with the connection e.g. the client closes the socket, the server blocked on a readwrite receives a SIGPIPE signal. I want to ignore it the server simply closes its sockets end because the communication is now impossible. Is it a good wayp  pAre there other signals Ive to considerp

Negative 4278 pI have a simple directory structure that I use to build my projects which is compatible with a simple makefile. p  pI have a directory called codeincludecode within my project folder, and this directory contains headers, mostly from the libraries that I link to.p  pSo, in Xcode Id like to simply include this folder full of includes so that my sources and headers from the Xcode project can find them, so that I can compile. Im going to worry about compiling these libraries to link to them once I can get my source files compiled.p  pI have added my include folder so that it shows up as a blue folder in the Xcode project, and it also exists in real directory form inside the Xcode project directory in the filesystem. It is called include. p  pI have also put codeincludecode into the Project Search Paths configuration settings under Header Search Paths and User Header Search Paths and turned on Always Search User Paths to no avail. The build fails to find my headers. p  pI really dont want to have a completely different way to organize all my files in order to work with Xcode there are just too many of them. p  pSurely somebody here has experience getting an existing project like this to compile in Xcode. Any help is appreciated. Basically, Im trying to set up a reasonably quick way to get an existing makefile project compiling in Xcode.p

Negative 4278 pI am working on a small app to translate and import a large amount of data from one database to another. To do this, Im using Entity Framework and some custom extensions to commit a page of items at a time, in batches of 1000 or so. Since this can take a while, I was also interested in making sure the whole thing wouldnt grind to a halt if there is a hiccup in the connection while its running.p  pI chose the Transient Fault Handling Application block, part of Enterprise Library 5.0, following a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combappfabriccatarchive20101211sqlazureandentityframeworkconnectionfaulthandling.aspx relnofollowthis articlea see Case 2 Retry Policy With Transaction Scope. Here is an example of my implementation in the form of an ObjectContext extension, which simply adds objects to the context and tries to save them, using a Retry Policy focused on Sql Azure stuffp  precodepublic static void AddObjectsAndSaveltTgtthis ObjectContext context, IEnumerableltTgt objects     where T  EntityObject      ifobjects.Any         return      var policy  new RetryPolicyltSqlAzureTransientErrorDetectionStrategygt         10, TimeSpan.FromSeconds10     var tso  new TransactionOptions     tso.IsolationLevel  IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted      var name  context.GetTableNameltTgt      foreachvar item in objects         context.AddObjectname, item       policy.ExecuteAction gt              usingTransactionScope ts  new TransactionScopeTransactionScopeOption.Required, tso                      context.SaveChanges              ts.Complete                codepre  pThe code works great, until I actually test the Retry Policy by pausing my local instance of Sql Server while its running. It almost immediately poops, which is odd. You can see that Ive got the policy configured to try again in ten second intervals either it is ignoring the interval or failing to catch the error. I suspect the latter, but Im new to this so I dont really know.p

Negative 4278 pI currently have an application which receives live, raw PCM data from a remote source via UDP.  I would like to stream this to a web browser through a simple, straightforward HTML5 tag.  In researching this project, Ive come across IceCast a number of times which, as near as I can tell, can be configured to take in raw PCM and serve up an MPEG audio stream, thereby fulfilling my needs.  However much this may or may not work with IceCast, though, I would like to implement my own, custom solution.p  pSo, to phrase this question in more specific terms, is solving this problem as simple as LAMEencoding the raw PCM data as it arrives and passing it along via HTTP  I imagine this working as a CGIFastCGI application, but I am by no means wedded to this form of solution.  Is there any other magic going on behind the scenes with IceCast  And, finally, to sanity check there is no special streamfile header I would need to send first, rightp

Negative 4278 pIve been stuck on this problem for a while now...didnt have much luck trying to find what is going on.p  pIf I post a json request to the rails rest service, sometimes I am getting the params hash nested and sometimes not. For example, if I have controller A and controller B....as far as I can tell, there is no difference between the two. Just simple rest interfaces in both. However, in the create method of controller A, the params are nested in the json when I receive the request to create. In controller B, they are not nested. p  pIn other words, controller As create method I can access params[a] and it has all the params I am looking for. In controller Bs create method, I cannot access params[b]...everything is available in params but not nested under params[b] params[b] is an empty hash. p  pWhat are the things I have to check to ensure consistency What is it that triggers rails to nest the hash in some occasions and not in others. Any help or pointers greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4278 pThis has been driving me mad for months I have a little app to preview camera raw images. As the files in question can be quite big and stored on a slow network drive I wanted to offer the user a chance to stop the loading of the image.p  pHandily I found this threadp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9117332cancelnsdatainitwithcontentsofurlinnsoperation9117373comment186011349117373Cancel NSData initWithContentsOfURL in NSOperationap  pand am using Nicks great convenience method to cache the data and be able to issue a cancel request halfway through.p  pAnyway, once I have the data I usep  precodeNSImage sourceImage  [[NSImage alloc]initWithDatadata] codepre  pThe problem comes when looking at Nikon .NEF files codesourceImagecode returns only a thumbnail and not the full size. Displaying Canon .CR2 files and in fact, any other .TIFFs and .JPEGs seems fine and codesourceImagecode is the expected size. Ive checked the amount of data that is being loaded with codeNSLogcode and code[data length]code and it does seem that all of the Nikon files 12mb is there for the codeinitWithDatacodep  pIf I usep  precodeNSImage sourceImage  [[NSImage alloc]initWithContentsOfURLmyNEFURL] codepre  pthen I get the full sized image of the Nikon files but of course the app blocks.p  pSo after poking around for what is beginning to feel like my entire life I think I know that the problem is related to the Nikons metadata stating that the files DPI is 300 whereas Canon et al is 72.p  pI hoped a solution would be to lazily access the file withp  precodeNSImagetempImg  [[NSImage alloc] initByReferencingURLmyNEFURL] codepre  pand having seen similar postings here and elsewhere I found a common possible answer of simplyp  precode[sourceImage setSizetempImg.size] codepre  pbut of course this just resizes the tiny thumbnail up to 3000x2000 or thereabouts.p  pIve been messing with the following hoping that they would provide a way to get the big picture from the .NEFp  precodeCGImageSourceRef isr  CGImageSourceCreateWithDatabridge CFDataRefdata, NULL CGImageRef isrRef  CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndexisr, 0, NULL codepre  pandp  precodeNSBitmapImageRep bitMapIR  [[NSBitmapImageRep alloc] initWithDatadata] codepre  pBut checking the sizes on these show similar thumbnail widths and heights. In fact, codeisrRefcode returns an even smaller thumbnail, one that is 4.2 times smaller. Perhaps worth noting that 300  72  4.2, so codeisrRefcode is taking account of the DPI on an image where the DPI possibly has already been observed.p  pPlease Can someone [nicely] put me out of my misery and help me get the fullsized image from the loaded data Currently, Im specialcaseing the NEF files with a case insensitive search on the file extension and then loading the URL with the blocking methods. I have to take a hit on the app blocking and the search cant be foolproof in the long run.p  pAs an aside is this actually a bug in the OS It does seem like codeNSImages initWithDatacode and codeinitWithContentsOfURLcode methods use different engines to actually render the image. Would it not be reasonable to have assumed that codeinitWithURLcode simply loads the data which then gets rendered just as though it had been presented to the class with codeinitWithDatacode p

Negative 4278 pbHbello all,p  pIm creating a game where some particles are created after a collision between two objects.

Negative 4278 pI am using python 2.6.6 and I need to overload the default python print function. I need to do it because this code may be used on a system where a builtin function has to be used to generate output, otherwise no output is displayed.p  pSo, just for example, if you have a python script like thisp  precodefrom future import printfunction  def NewPrintStr     with opensomefile.txt,a as AFile         AFile.writeStr  def OverloadPrint     global print     print  NewPrint  OverloadPrint printha codepre  pIt works fine. The input to the overloaded print is in the file specified by NewPrint.p  pNow with that in mind I would like to be able to run the couple of lines above and have print to do what NewPrint does during the entire execution of the script. Right now if I call a function from another module that uses print it will use the builtin print and not the one I just overwrote. I guess this has something to do with namespaces and builtins, but my python is not good enough.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI tried to keep simple, but looks like this caused more confusion...p  ol liThe function that overloads print will print to a GUI, so no need to care about redirection strongIFstrong the function is overloaded.li lipI know my example does not do what the print function actually does.

So I did not really worry much about some other module calling print and having something else instead.li ol  pFrom all the comments I guess that just using some print function instead of print  which is what we currently do may be the best, but I got really curious to see if in python it would be possible to do what I described.p

Negative 4278 pWhile working on a LOB desktop application with a lot of CRUD operations using a hrefhttpcompositewpf.codeplex.com relnofollowPRISMa and a hrefhttpentlib.codeplex.com relnofollowEnterprise Librarya, I have noticed a recurring pattern that seems annoying. For every domain model entity eg. Contact I find my self wrapping it with a view model eg. ContactVM then I introduce a new codeContactsVMcode notice the s where the latter class accepts a repository interface which is used to populate an codeObservableCollectionltContactVMgtcode and for every codeContactcode entity that I read from the repository, I wrap it in a codeContactVMcode which I pass the entity to via the constructor along with other enterprise library services needed by my ViewModel.p  pThe problem is that all my view model constructors started taking this pattern like this p  pcodeViewModelEntityToWrap e, DependencyFromEntLib, OtherDependencies ...code p  pNow that is a problem because most tools and libraries require a default parameterless constructor eg. some commercial data grids need that to provide filtering support, plus you cant use design data to visualize entities because they need parameterless constructors too. and finally the question What is the right way to build view models and should Entlib services be provided via constructors or via the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff648968.aspx relnofollowServiceLocatora p

Negative 4278 pI have a program which will be receiving information from an external source via System.in.  There are two input modes line mode and raw mode.  During line mode, input is simply a series of UTF8 strings, each terminated with a line feed character.  At some point while in line mode, I will receive notification that I am about to receive N bytes of raw data.  At that point the input switches to raw mode and I receive exactly N bytes of raw binary data, which are not valid UTF8 characters.  After this point, it returns to line mode.p  pIs there a way to easily switch between reading strings and reading raw data  My only thought is to read an InputStream byte by byte and translate to characters as I go.  Are there any ways to wrap System.in with multiple types of input streams  I feel like reading from two different wrappers would cause problems.p  pstrongFIXED Updatestrongp  pI tried parsifals suggestion, but am running into a problem.  To simulate the switching input modes, I modified my test harness.  I realized that another process I have will eventually need to output this way as well.  I dont know if the problem is caused by the send or receive end.  When I switch between output modes, it doesnt seem to be reading in the bytes properly.  Also, its always the same byte values that appear.  Here are some code excerptsp  pstrongFIXstrong  The problem was that apparently you cant switch from the OutputStreamWriter to OutputStream too quickly.

If I instead give a pulse to the server, even one byte at a time, then I never get this exception and I can continue to transfer data indefinitely. Ive constructed a very simple example application to demonstrate this which uses basicHttpBinding with Streamed transferMode and I insert an artificial delay from within a custom stream implementation on the client that delays for 130 seconds. This simulates something similar to a buffer underrun condition in which the stream provided in my service call from the client is not feeding the data to the WCF infrastructure quick enough to satisfy some sort of unidentifiable timeout value that appears to be around the 130 second mark.p  pUsing the WCF service tracing tools Im able to find an HttpException with the a message that reads The client is disconnected because the underlying request has been completed.  There is no longer an HttpContext available.p  pFrom the IIS Express trace log file I see an entry that says The IO operation has been aborted because of either a thread exit or an application request. 0x800703e3p  pIve configured both server and client timeouts to use a value well over the 130 second mark just to rule them out.

This got me looking into what I could configure for HTTP.sys and also what type of issues people are reporting that for HTTP.sys that sound similar to what Im experiencing. This lead me to a log file located at emCWindowsSystem32LogFilesHTTPERRhttperr1.logem which appears to log specific types of HTTP issues on the part of HTTP.sys. In this log I see the following type of log entry each time I run my test.p  blockquote   p20130115 171712 127.0.0.1 59111 127.0.0.1 52733 HTTP1.1 POST   StreamingService.svc   TimerEntityBody p blockquote  pSo its down to finding what conditions could cause a a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb8207293TimerEntityBodya error and what settings in IIS7 or elsewhere may have a bearing on when and if that error occurs.p  pFrom the a hrefhttpwww.iis.netconfigreferencesystem.applicationhostsitessitedefaultslimitsofficial IIS webisteap  blockquote   pThe connection expired before the request entity body arrived. When it   is clear that a request has an entity body, the HTTP API turns on the   TimerEntityBody timer. Initially, the limit of this timer is set to   the connectionTimeout value. Each time another data indication is   received on this request, the HTTP API resets the timer to give the   connection more minutes as specified in the connectionTimeout   attribute.p blockquote  pTrying to modify the connectionTimeout attribute as the reference above suggests for in applicationhost.config for IIS Express doesnt seem to make any difference. Perhaps IIS Express ignores this configuration and uses a hard coded value internally Trying something on my own I discovered that there are new netsh http commands added to show and add timeout values so giving that I go I came up with the following command but unfortunately doing so didnt seem to have any effect on this error either.p  blockquote   pnetsh http add timeout  timeouttypeIdleConnectionTimeout value300p blockquote

Negative 4278 pI have written this code for pinging class C IP addresses on port 6789, the thread starts when I click on a button called codePINGcode.

Here is the code I thought would workp  precode voidviewDidLoad      if self.scrollView4.contentOffset.y gt 100 ampamp self.scrollView4.contentOffset.y lt     200               [self.scrollView4 setContentOffsetCGPointMake100,0]       codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp  pEDIT If forgot to mention that if I make an if statement to say that if the contentOffset is equal to the contentOffset that it starts off with, then the action is executed. It would seem that the contentOffset remains at the value that it was given when the app loaded. I should mention that earlier in the app, I set the contentOffset to a value but I dont know if that affects anything.p
Negative 4278 pI have recently implemented a typical 3 layer neural network input  hidden  output and Im using the sigmoid function for activation. So far, the host program has 3 modesp  ol liCreation, which seems to work fine. It creates a network with a specified number of input, hidden and output neurons, initializes the weights to either random values or zero.li liTraining, which loads a dataset, computes the output of the network then backpropagates the error and updates the weights. As far as I can tell, this works ok. The weights change, but not extremely, after training on the dataset.li liProcessing, which seems to work ok. However, the data output for the dataset which was used for training, or any other dataset for that matter is very bad. Its usually either just a continuuous stream of 1s, with an occasional 0.999999 or every output value for every input is 0.9999 with the last digits being different between inputs. As far as I could tell there was no correlation between those last 2 digits and what was supposed to be outputed.li ol  pHow should I go about figuring out whats not working rightp

Essentially, Im in need of the necessary .htaccess code that will allow me to redirect visitors attempting to access files situated within domainA.comfolderA to domainB.comfolderBp  pSo, if a visitor were to visit...p  pa hrefhttpdomainA.comfolderApage1.html relnofollowhttpdomainA.comfolderApage1.htmlap  p... they would be immediately transferred to...p  pa hrefhttpdomainB.comfolderBpage1.html relnofollowhttpdomainB.comfolderBpage1.htmlap  pIf anyone can help me out, I would be very much grateful. Thanks a bunch for looking into my likelyverystraightforwardbutstillheadscratching quandaryp

Negative 4278 pI am working on an application in which contains a few DIVs having IDs like stronga1,a2,a3strong etc. There is option of navigation DIVs by hitting emnextem and empreviousem button which brings one Div on screen at a time. strongstrong textstrong There are two more actions strongAddstrong and strongRemovestrong. Add adds a Div with ID greated than last ID, for instance if last DIV id was stronga3strong then Add brings stronga4strong.p  pThe real issue is removing current DIV. If the user is on Div stronga2strong and hits strongRemovestrong option then it deletes the current Div by using code.removecode method of jQueryp  pNow navigation breaks because it is sequential. It tries to find Div stronga2strong but does not find. What I think that Ids of all remaining DIVs should be renamed. Since there is no stronga2strong so stronga3strong should become a2 and so on.

Negative 4278 pIm having a pretty unique problem. Im using the python module urllib2 in order to get http responses from a local terminal. At first, urllib2 would only work with nonlocal addresses i.e. google.com, etc. and not local webservers. I eventually deduced that urllib2 was not respecting the noproxy environment variable. If I manually erased the other proxy env variables in the code i.e. set httpproxy to , then it seemed to fix it for my CentOS 6 box. p  pHowever, I have a second machine running Fedora 12 that needs to run the same python script, and I cannot for the life of me get urllib2 to connect to the local terminal. If I set httpproxy to  then I cant access anything at all  not google, not the local terminal. However, I have a third machine running Fedora 12 and the fix that I found for CentOS 6 works with that one. p  pThis leads me to my question. Is there an easy way to tell the difference between Fedora 12 Box1 which doesnt work and Fedora 12 Box2 which does Maybe theres a list of linux config files that could conceivably affect the functionality of urllib2 I know etcenvironment can affect it with proxyrelated environment variables and I know the routing tables could affect it. What else am I missingp  pNote  Pinging the terminal with both boxes works. Urllib2 can only fetch http responses from the CentOS box and Fedora 12 Box2, currently. p  pInfo Ive tested this with Python 2.6.2 Python 2.6.6 Python 2.7.5p  pon all three boxes. Same results each time.p

Here is a simplified version of my codep  precodeDELIMITER  CREATE PROCEDURE doSomething BEGIN     SET mycount  0     INSERT INTO results dataid, mycounter         SELECT data.id, mycount  mycount1         FROM data LEFT JOIN results ON data.id  results.dataid         WHERE ... GROUP BY ...         HAVING ...         ORDER BY ... END  DELIMITER  codepre  pstrongAnalysisstrong This almost works as desired except I need codemycountcode to reset to zero each time it is run and the codeSETcode statement above is not achieving that. When debugging, I can see that the last value of codemycountcode is always remembered from the previous run of the stored procedure.  Ive also tried setting it to zero after the insert.p  pstrongNotesstrongp  ol liI am using a codecode variable to increment and keep track of row number. Perhaps there is another option hereli liThe problem seems related to the Having clause.  When I run a similar but different query without the having clause, the variable resets no problem.li ol  pstrongQuestionstrong Why cant I set codemycountcode to zero before running each time  If it IS resetting and its just that my Having clause causes an unexpected count, is there some better way to rewrite my SQLp  pIm hoping someone has run into something similar, since this seems pretty obscure.p

However im not to physically sort the list by component percent gainloss instead provide a logical ordering with respect to this component.  so basically i added a data member, a vector to hold the indices of the stock list ordered by the component percent gainloss. i called it array indexByGain. so when i print the list ordered by the percent gainloss, i use the array indexByGain to print the list. my problem is an i need help on how to start if someone could show me an example or explain on how to go about this i can continue or correct me on my rough draft that will be helpful. i have an idea  but bare with me as this is a rough draft. below is a rough draft of my code. stockType has to do with the where data is stored from the file.p  precode   include ltiostreamgt    include stockType.h    class stockListType          public        void sortBySymbolssort out symbols and it comiples correctly.        void sortByGain        void printByGain        void insertconst stockTypeamp item      private    vectorltintgt indexByGaindeclared a vector array indexByGain..     vectorltstockTypegt list           void stockListTypeinsertconst stockTypeamp item             list.pushbackiteminserts the data from file to vector array.             function prints out the gain      void stockListTypeprintByGain       my code to print out the gain..          function to sort the gain and this is where i am stuck.       void stockListTypesortGain                    int i, j, min, maxindex           fori0iltlist.sizei                         min  i              forji1jltlist.sizej                list[maxindex].getPercentageltlist[j].getPercentage                  maxindex  j                  indexGain.pushbackmaxindex             codepre  ppls bare as it a rough draft. i know i am wrong but am i starting on a good base or totally of. please you could assist me or correct me.

Negative 4278 h3Backgroundh3  pI have to migrte a existing javascript application one page app to extjs. The display and behavior of the application depends on the users permission.p  h3Current designh3  pThe application is divided into empluginsem, which represent a feature set to which permissions are granted. Each of those plugins consists of a single javascript file. A user can have permissions for one or more plugins. Depending on the permissions, those files are loaded in the head of the page. Each of these plugins will add its entries to the main menu and expose the methods used to drive the application.br The permissions are stored in a mysql database.p  h3ExtJss default designh3  pIn ExtJs the source files contain each a class. During the build process, all .js files are concatenated to yield one big .js file, that contains everything.p  h3What would be the best design approachh3  ol liI considered to use custom compilation with codesencha cmdcode, and create that way a .js file for each plugin. Then I could load these empluginsem the same way I do it now. But this results in a complicated build and deployment process.li liI also thought about creating one and only .js file with a standard Ext build process. I would then load the permissions from the server via ajax in order to construct the menu. All the objects and methods would exist, but only those are accessible where the user has permissions.li ol  pIn my opinion, the second approach is much easier maintainable, but it seens to have a security problem, because everyone could look at the source and find out about the data interfaces exposed on the server and consumed by ajax.p  pAny comments, ideas or advices are welcome.

Negative 4278 pWe have a project to develop an AFISAutomated Fingerprint.. We have read many papers on the field and still reading Handbook of Fingerprint Recognition. What we arent able to understand is  Where are we exactly going to use Neural Networksp  pSo far we get  1Apply Histogram Eq.  DFTif necessary to get contrast and remove noise. 2Image Binarization  3Image Thinning Morphological Thinning These are okay. After that , there is feature extraction. Working in 3x3 windows we search for minutiae points , looking for patterns like  1 in middle , and only has one other 1 neighbor so it is termination . Then we get minutiae points and we use Poincare Index method to get singular points. But after that , while we have minutiaes and singulars , where are we going to use neural network If for classification , how Since we extracted singular points with poincare index why do we need ANN to classify If for extracting minutiae points , havent we done it with feature extraction Any resources you might want to point out Thanks.p

Negative 4278 pIm working on a problem from Algorithm Design by Kleinberg, specifically problem 4.15. Im not currently enrolled in the class that this relates to  Im taking a crack at the problem set before the new quarter starts to see if Id be able to do it. The question is as followsp  precodeThe manager of a large student union on campus comes to you with the following problem. Shes in charge of a group of n students, each of whom is scheduled to work one shift during the week. There are different jobs associated with these shifts tending the main desk, helping with package delivery, rebooting cranky information kiosks, etc., but.we can view each shift as a single contiguous interval of time. There can be multiple shifts going on at once.  Shes trying to choose a subset of these n students to form a super vising committee that she can meet with once a week. She considers such a committee to be complete if, for every student not on the committee, that students shift overlaps at least partially the shift of some student who is on the committee. In this way, each students performance can be observed by at least one person whos serving on the committee. Give an efficient algorithm that takes the schedule of n shifts and produces a complete supervising committee containing as few students as possible.  Example. Suppose n  3, and the shifts are Monday 4 p.M.Monday 8 P.M., Monday 6 p.M.Monday 10 P.M., Monday 9 P.M.Monday 1I P.M..  Then the smallest complete supervising committee would consist of just the second student, since the second shift overlaps both the first and the third. codepre  pMy attempt I cant find this problem in my solution manual, so Im asking herep  precode    Construct a graph G with vertices S1, S2, ..., Sn for each student.  Let there be an edge between Si and Sj iff students i and j have an overlapping  shift. Let C represent the set of students in the supervising committee.  [On  2m to build an adjacency list, where m is the number of shifts  Since we have to add at least each student to the adjacency list, and add an  additional m entries for each shift, with two entries added per shift since  our graph is undirected.]  Sort the vertices by degree into a list S [On log n].  While S[0] has degree gt 0     1 Add Si to C. [O1]     2 Delete Si and all of the nodes that it was connected to, update the  adjacency list.     3 Update S so that it is once again sorted. Add any remaining vertices of degree 0 to C. codepre  pIm not sure how to quantify the runtime of 2 and 3. Since the degree of any node is bounded by n, it seems that 2 is bounded by On. But the degree of the node removed in 1 also affects the number of iterations performed inside of the codewhilecode loop, so I suspect that its possible to say something about the upper bound of the whole codewhilecode loop  something to the effect of Any sequence of deletions will involve deleting at most n nodes in linear time and resorting at most n nodes in linear time, resulting in an upper bound of On log n for the codewhilecode loop, and therefore of the algorithm as a whole.p

Negative 4278 pIm currently working on a site hosted on a Drupal CMS which is performing a number of ajax calls to retrieve data from a java REST API. Basically drupal is only used for content purposes whereas the ajax calls are used to retrieve backend data like user account details, account balance. p  pIm performing an average of 3 ajax calls per page and theyre all passing through https which seems to slow things down. The main problem I have is that the pages appear without the data received from the ajax calls for a second or two which doesnt look good visually. If the user is running on a slow internet connection, the wait can take up to 5 seconds. p  pTo workout around this, I had to do some css hacks to prevent the html elements from moving when theyre populated with the ajax data. Im also noticing that https is adding a minimum of 100ms to every ajax calls which seems pretty steep to me. p  pWould node.js or ember.js help me remedy this situation in some form or another I recently started researching about the two and was wondering if they would be of any help. Im mostly using jQuery on the sitep  pThanks, Joep

I do this to manipulate some data before sending it via socket.send, reusing code that would otherwise be repeated.p  pThen I have some very basic html that includes this JS library and a simple script runs as followsp  precodedocument.readyfunction      myObject.doSomething  codepre  pThe error I get is Failed to execute send on Websocket already in CONNECTING state. p  pThe library successfully loads but the Websocket does not complete connection before the client script is run. How can I ensure my WebSocket is connected readystate  1 before the API finishes loadingp  pThanks for the helpp
Negative 4278 pI am trying to extract a substring code022014101code from a string codestr1codep  precodestr1  ltCUserTestxyz022014101morestuff0220141gt               I dont need the 2nd 022014, only the first occuring one 022014101 codepre  pI usually use codesplitcode and split the string after codecode to get the code[5]codeth item but that is bad in case I have more subfolders... As you can see the first 6 digits of code022014101code are representing a date plus some characters 101 in this case. I think I should use regex, but how can I match 6 digits and get everything until a codecode occurs. I dont have much experience with regex, anyone knows the solution Thanks.p

Negative 4278 pI have 2 problems when I added the restore method for iAP...p  pProblem 1 Everytime I open my app a iTunes alert comes up and ask if I wanna login  to the iTunes Store.

It seems that Apple already connects with iTunes at the  startup of the app. I wanna make this only when a user hits the purchase  or restore button. I read several things on StackOverflow that you have  to add something in your AppDelegate so that the app is not connecting  automatically but with still no luck.p  pProblem 2 When testing the iAP on my phone and hit the restore button the item can  be restored, even if I didnt purchased it before. Is this normal when  testing the restore function with a test account You should say that  Apple have to show alert that the item has never been purchased and  cannot be restoredp  pCan someone please guide me stepbystep with this to make it workp  pThanks in advance.p  pThe codep  precode IBActionRestoreidsender      [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] addTransactionObserverself]     [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] restoreCompletedTransactions]   voidpaymentQueueRestoreCompletedTransactionsFinishedSKPaymentQueue queue      [self unlockFeature]   pragma mark  pragma mark SKPaymentTransactionObserver  voidpaymentQueueSKPaymentQueue queue updatedTransactionsNSArray transactions      for SKPaymentTransaction transaction in transactions              switch transaction.transactionState              case SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased                 [self unlockFeature]                 [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue]                  finishTransactiontransaction]                 break              case SKPaymentTransactionStateFailed                 NSLogTransaction Failed                 [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue]                  finishTransactiontransaction]                 break              default                 break                codepre

Negative 4278 pI hope this is not a recurring question, but i dont seem to find anything on what i am trying to do. I am to store a small data structure about 40 bytes in size on a flash memory of the microprocessor as a look up table. The device can be interfaced to the PC, so that the end user can configure this tablewithout being able to program the micro to suit the needs of his particular system. It would make sense to me to store it in an array and it would be convenient for me to access this data in code, however then i would need some way of forcing this array to point to a specific memory location. Section of flash where the table is to be stored is not really flash  but EEPROM and is configured and partitioned by me. Any ideas on how I could go about it  using kinetis K60DX256 micro, not much experience in storing data structures Thanksp

Negative 4278 pI have an old Access project .adp that was tied to a SQL Server database using integrated authentication. The .adp is only used this time of year.

I got this with another .mdb and just remapped the linked tables through ODBC with a SQL Server login integrated authentication is not a requirement. However, with this .adp file, just about all the options are greyed out. For example, Linked Table Manager and ODBC Database buttons are greyed out.

Negative 4278 pI am trying to setup an codeEGLImagecode where the source sibling is a codeGLRENDERBUFFERcode the codeEGLClientBuffercode specified as an argument to codeeglCreateImageKHRcode. In another context, I create a codeGLTEXTURE2Dcode and specify it as the target sibling of the codeEGLImagecode by using codeglEGLImageTargetTexture2DOEScode. Unfortunately, the latter call leads to a codeGLINVALIDOPERATIONcode. If both the source and target siblings are codeGLTEXTURE2Dcodes, the setup works like a charm.p  pFrom my reading of the specification, this should be a permissable operation. It is also possible that my reduced test case has some other orthogonal issue. Though I doubt this since the setup works fine when both the source and target siblings are codeGLTEXTURE2Dcodes.

Negative 4278 pI am building a RSS reader using the Play Framework, play authenticate, and mongodb accessed through Morphia. Its running on a Ubuntu server with a VIA Nano processor U2250 1.6GHz Capable and 2ghz ram apparently. Despite every tweak and optimization I could think of, I still observe insane delays in the answering time from 2seconds to 1 minute to answer a simple HTTP GET request to mark an item as read Ill talk about this example because it is simple. Note that i am not facing this problem on local tests on my personal machine, just on remote deployment. Profiling gives me the following distribution of spent time to answer a dozen mark as read requests p  precode org.bson.io.PoolOutputBuffer.pipe 11  org.bson.io.Bits.readFully 10  scala.concurrent.forkjoin.ForkJoinPool.scan 8  org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.SelectorUtil.select 7  org.bson.io.PoolOutputBuffer.write 5  com.google.code.morphia.mapping.DefaultCreator.getNoArgsConstructor 5 codepre  pfrom which I gathered the IO with the database was the bottleneck. I have made the references explicit using a custom class Reflt because Keylt was handling package names fairly poorly. Therefore the aforementioned mark as read request only does 3 db queries  retrieve the item by its ref id, retrieve the inbox by its ref id stored in the session cache, remove the item from the inbox and store it back again.

Negative 4278 pOk, so Im working with my first serious experience in XNA. Heres my current task Download a file. From that file parse a list of shapes. Each shape contains a list of points. These points are the vertexes of lines to be drawn on a map. In fact, it is a county map of the entire United States, so the number of shapes is not trivial. We need to be able to zoom in and out of this map, so it needs to be a 2d rendering in 3d space. I want to know what the best strategy for this would be.p  pIve tried simply using DrawUserIndexedPrimitives, but the draw function takes way too long to process this.p  pSo then I thought Id try drawing to a series of RenderTarget2Ds in LoadContent, and just saving those textures for drawing in the Draw function.

Negative 4278 pI am running a simulation that competes two types of agents against each other. Lets call these agents red and blue. There are three possible outcomes red wins, blue wins, or everyone loses. Lets say, also, that the system depends on two parameters X and Y.p  pWhat I would like to do is create a pseudocolor plot that encodes outcome as a function of X and Y. p  ul lipThe hue of every point is the likelihood that either red or blue wins, given that somebody wins. If blue always wins, its blue if red always wins, its red etc. pli lipThe saturation is the probability that anyone wins. So if nobody ever wins at some value of X and Y, that point will be grey in an HSV model, anyway.pli ul  pEDIT So lets say that were using an HSV model as encoded a hrefhttptech.protutorial653javascriptinteractivecolorpicker relnofollowherea. It doesnt have to be that, but lets say that it is. Pure blue is 240, 100, 100 in HSV space and pure red is 360, 100, 100. Suppose, too, that red wins 50 of the time, blue wins 25 of the time, and nobody wins 25 of the time. Then this point will be 330, 75, 100. p  pNote that Im not worried about converting from HSV to RGB  for that, I can just use codecol2rgbhsv...code. The issue is the plotting itself. The image function, as far as I can tell, can only encode one channel of information this is two channels of information. p  pAdditionally, the outcome is a continuous function of X and Y, so I want to interpolate between the values. I am using the akima package for that, if it matters. Hence the solution that I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19289358howcaniplotaimagewithxyrgbcoordinatesusingggplot2herea doesnt help me I think.p  pIm happy to use any package. Im also happy to not use R, as long as the result is pretty and isnt too involved.p  pThank you for any help you can offer.p

Negative 4278 pIn many situations, I find it convenient to place square axes on a figure so that I can easily work in codetransAxescode units without having to worry about the aspect ratio of the figure. However, one problem Im having is that when you draw a line, the linewidth extends codelw2code points in either direction from the path. This is the normal, expected behavior, of course, but it causes the problem that if Im trying to inscribe something into some axes and use all the space in the bounding box, the lines will clip on the edge of the axis. I can set codecliponFalsecode, but that just makes it so that the figure I was trying to inscribe in the axis exceeds the boundaries of the axes. My question is this  how do I transform between the linewidth spec in points and the codetransAxescode units, so that I can compensate for the additional lengthwidth of the shapesp  pIve worked up a simple MWE that should demonstrate what I meanp  precode MWE demonstrating the cliping of linewidths that are inscribed in axes.  from future import division from matplotlib.pyplot import figure, show, savefig from matplotlib.pyplot import Circle from matplotlib.lines import Line2D   Make a figure figw, figh  7.5, 2.5 cdpi  150 figaspect  fighfigw fig  figure1, figsizefigw, figh, dpicdpi   Helper functions to center the circles getwfromh  lambda h hfigaspect getbfromh  lambda h 1h2 getlcentered  lambda left, span, w leftspanw2   Left circle 1  The line at the center shows that lw is the same number of pixels no matter   what transform you use. lh  0.25 lw  getwfromhlh        lb  getbfromhlh ll  getlcentered0, 13, lw lbox  [ll, lb, lw, lh]  lcax  fig.addaxeslbox lclw  2.0 lcirc  Circle0.5, 0.5, 0.5, lwlclw, colorFF3932, fillFalse, transformlcax.transAxes lline  Line2D[0.5, 1.5], [0.5, 0.5], lwlclw4, colorFF3932,               dashes[5,1e14,1e14, 5], cliponFalse, transformlcax.transAxes lcax.addpatchlcirc lcax.addlinelline lcax.axisoff   Left Circle 2 lh2  0.75 lw2  getwfromhlh2      lb2  getbfromhlh2 ll2  getlcentered0, 13, lw2 lbox2  [ll2, lb2, lw2, lh2]  lcax2  fig.addaxeslbox2 lcirc2  Circle0.5, 0.5, 0.5, lwlclw, colorb20500, fillFalse, transformlcax2.transAxes lline2  Line2D[0.1, 0.9], [0.5, 0.5], lwlclw4, colorb20500,               dashes[1e14,5,5, 1e14], transformlcax2.transAxes lcax2.addpatchlcirc2 lcax2.addlinelline2 lcax2.axisoff    Middle circle mh  0.9 mw  getwfromhmh        mb  getbfromhmh ml  getlcentered13, 13, mw mbox  [ml, mb, mw, mh]  mcax  fig.addaxesmbox mclw  4.0 mcirc  Circle0.5, 0.5, 0.5, lwmclw, colorb, fillFalse,                 cliponFalse,                transformmcax.transAxes mcax.addpatchmcirc mcax.axisoff   Right circle 1 rh  0.75 rw  getwfromhrh        rb  getbfromhrh rl  getlcentered23, 13, rw rbox  [rl, rb, rw, rh]  rcax  fig.addaxesrbox, zorder1 rclw  2.0 rcirc  Circle0.5, 0.5, 0.5, lwrclw, edgecolork, facecolor4E4E4E,                 fillTrue, transformrcax.transAxes rcax.addpatchrcirc rcax.axisoff   Right circle 2 rh2  0.5 rw2  getwfromhrh2      rb2  getbfromhrh2 rl2  getlcentered23, 13, rw2 rbox2  [rl2, rb2, rw2, rh2]  rcax2  fig.addaxesrbox2, zorder2 rcirc2  Circle0.5, 0.5, 0.5, lwrclw, edgecolornone, facecolorBBBBBB,                 fillTrue, transformrcax2.transAxes rcax2.addpatchrcirc2 rcax2.axisoff  savefigClippingMWE.png, transparentTrue, dpicdpi codepre  pThis generates this figure img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAteVB.png altClipping figurep  pBased on the comparison in the left circle, it seems like the linewidth is always the same number of pixels no matter what axis it is placed in which makes sense. The center circle is what Id like the circles to all look like no clipping, but of course the circle is actually slightly wider than I wanted it to be. The circle on the right shows where the clipping box acts relative to the line. Clearly theres no problem inscribing emfilledem circles in the axes.p  pWhile I would also be interested in knowing if theres a flag or something I could set to draw the line on a certain side of the path e.g. draw the line on the eminsideem of the path rather than centered on the path, Im primarily interested in how to convert from codelwcode to codetransAxescode units, because I have essentially the same problem when trying to calculate the amount of space I need to accommodate a font of a given size.p

Negative 4278 pI am using Quartz v2.2.3.400 downloaded from NuGet, .NET Framework v4.5, and using C. I have several jobs that inherit from codeIJobcode and utilize the codeIJobExecutionContextcode object passed into the codeExecutecode method. Those are working great. I also created a global job listener inheriting from codeIJobListenercode that logs every job that gets executed, again utilizing the codeIJobExecutionContextcode passed into the codeJobToBeExecutedcode, codeJobExecutionVetoedcode, and codeJobWasExecutedcode methods.p  pNow for my question. I also have a few jobs that scan directories for new files, which inherit from codeIDirectoryScanListenercode. This interface defines a method signature void codeFilesUpdatedOrAddedIEnumerableltFileInfogt updatedFilescode , which provides the file info for any new files in that directory since the last polling. That is great However, I cannot seem to find a way to access this jobs codeIJobExecutionContextcode , scheduler, etc. I would like to check some properties of the jobs context and add data to the data map, but I am unable to without the codeIJobExecutionContextcode  being exposed. Is there a way that this can be accessed to my class that inherits from codeIDirectoryScanListenercode p  pThanksp

Negative 4278 pI am going to write a script to parse a lot of log files, these files are on remote servers, so my script will have to telnetssh to these remote servers in order to issue some commandsCLI to get the data. Its going to be a lot of data, so i would like to know from your experience what is the best option to do this  Is it to download the commands output to local files and then do the parsing  or do it inline What makes one option better than other Other than occupying disk space.p  pThanks, Kimp

Negative 4278 pIve built a notification system, and its almost working. I just have one niggly bit that I cant seem to get my head around. When a new update comes in from a friend it prints out the number of new notifications as expected, only if a user posts twice numrows 2 pops up.. but if a user posts again it updates and replaces the 2 new notifications number back to 1 in the div because Im using html in the ajax to replace.  So my question is, how can I update the div to get the total amount of results so it goes 1,2,3,4 etc instead of 2,1,1,1,1. I dont want to replace the num of new rows with only the 1 update in the div, just add to the amount of new updates already inside it.p  pA bit like when facebook shows amount of notifications. say I have two and a friends posts on my wall I then will have 3.. but at the moment its adding the last new num row and going back to 1.p  pAJAXp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt function loadIt    var notificationidltphp echo notificationid[notificationid] gt   var notificationid window.localStorage.getItem lastId  .ajax type GET, url viewajax.phpnotificationidnotificationid,    dataTypejson, cache false,  success functionresponse  ifresponse     dataHandler     ifresponse.num        window.localStorage.setItemlastId, response.notificationid    var dataHandler  functionresponse    var isDuplicate  false, storedData  window.localStorage.getItem lastId     for var i  0 i lt storedData.length i       ifstoredData[i].indexOfresponse gt 1         isDuplicate  true              ifisDuplicate      storedData.pushresponse       ifresponse    ifresponse.num       notifactualtextnotificationid.prependltdiv  idnotifactualtextresponse[notificationid] classnotifactualtextgtlta hrefresponse[notificationid]gtresponse[notificationcontent] ltagtltbr gtresponse[notificationtime]ltdivgtltnrgt        mes.html response.num                      setIntervalloadIt, 10000 codepre  pPHPp  precodejson  array commysqliquerymysqli,select notificationid,notificationcontent,notificationtime from notifications where notificationid gt id AND notificationstatus1  echo mysqlierrormysqli  num  mysqlinumrowscom ifnum1      json[num]  num else     json[num]  0  resultArr  mysqlifetcharraycom json[notificationid]  resultArr[notificationid] json[notificationcontent]  resultArr[notificationcontent]  mysqlifreeresultcom headerContentType applicationjson echo jsonencodejson   codepre

Negative 4278 pIm working on a quite large application. The domain has about 2030 types, implemented as ORM classes for example EF Code First or XPO, doesnt matter for the question. Ive read several articles and suggestions about a generic implementation of the repository pattern and combining it with the unit of work pattern, resulting a code something like thisp  precodepublic interface IRepositoryltTgt    IQueryableltTgt AsQueryable   IEnumerableltTgt GetAllExpressionltFuncltT, boolgtgt filter   T GetByIDint id    T Create   void SaveT   void DeleteT   public interface IMyUnitOfWork  IDisposable    void CommitChanges   void DropChanges    IRepositoryltProductgt Products  get    IRepositoryltCustomergt Customers  get   codepre  pIs this pattern suitable for really large applications Every example has about 2, maximum 3 repositories in the unit of work. As far as I understood the pattern, at the end of the day the number of repository references lazy initialized in the implementation equal or nearly equal to the number of domain entity classes, so that one can use the unit of work for complex business logic implementation. So for example lets extend the above code like thisp  precodepublic interface IMyUnitOfWork  IDisposable    ...    IRepositoryltCustomergt Customers  get    IRepositoryltProductgt Products  get    IRepositoryltOrdersgt Orders  get     IRepositoryltProductCategorygt ProductCategories  get    IRepositoryltTaggt Tags  get     IRepositoryltCustomerStatisticsgt CustomerStatistics   get     IRepositoryltUsergt Users  get    IRepositoryltUserGroupgt UserGroups  get    IRepositoryltEventgt Events  get     ...     codepre  pHow many repositories cab be referenced until one thinks about code smell Or is it totally normal for this pattern I could probably separate this interface into 2 or 3 different interfaces all implementing IUnitOfWork, but then the usage would be less comfortable.p  pUPDATEp  pIve checked a basically nice solution a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma160858911515209herea recommended by qujck. My problem with the dynamic repository registration and dictionary based approach is that I would like to enjoy the direct references to my repositories, because some of the repositories will have special behaviour. So when I write my business code I would like to be able to use it like this for examplep  precodeusing var uow  new MyUnitOfWork    var allowedUsers  uow.Users.GetUsersInRolwmyRole    ... or   var clothes  uow.Products.GetInCategoriesscarf, hat, trousers  codepre  pSo here Im benefiting that I have a strongly typed IRepository and IRepository reference, hence I can use the special methods implemented as extension methods or by inheriting from the base interface. If I use a dynamic repository registration and retrieval method, I think Im gonna loose this, or at least have to do some ugly castings all the time.p  pFor the matter of DI, I would try to inject a repository factory to my real unit of work, so it can lazily instantiate the repositories.p

Negative 4278 pWhen Im benchmarking some code, either on a fixed set of input data, or on random input where the randomness doesnt affect the control flow what is the best metric to use to assess the performance of my codep  pIve always used minimum runtime over multiple runs because any deviation from the minimum will be due to the CPU being busy with unrelated things, but I couldnt find any reliable sources confirming that thats the best practice. Other obvious choices are average or median run time. Maximum seems odd, as it will probably be dominated by unrelated CPU spikes. Are there any better ways to make sense of the statistical data gathered from several runsp  pAs paxdiablo points out, if I can measure CPU time directly that would be ideal. But what do I do when I can only benchmark wall timep  pAs I said I was unable to find anything reliable on this, but maybe I just didnt find the right Google keywords, so if you can point me to anything existing, that would already be a great help. Also, please feel free to migrate this to Programmers.SE, if this question is too general for SO.p

There I put codeprimefaces5.0.jarcode and the following codemodule.xmlcodep  precodeltmodule xmlnsurnjbossmodule1.3 nameorg.primefacesgt   ltresourcesgt     ltresourceroot pathprimefaces5.0.jargt   ltresourcesgt    ltdependenciesgt     ltmodule namejavaee.apigt     ltmodule namejavax.faces.apigt   ltdependenciesgt ltmodulegt codepre  p2 In codeselene.earcode, in codeMETAINFcode, I have added the following codejbossdeploymentstructure.xmlcodep  precodeltjbossdeploymentstructuregt   ltearsubdeploymentsisolatedgttrueltearsubdeploymentsisolatedgt   ltsubdeployment nameSeleneWar.wargt     ltdependenciesgt       ltmodule nameorg.primefacesgt     ltdependenciesgt     ltlocallast valuetrue gt   ltsubdeploymentgt ltjbossdeploymentstructuregt codepre  pIt seems that everything is ok Wildfly starts with no errors if I remove the module folder then it start complaining about the missing dependencies. Yet, if I remove the primefaces jar from the war assembly the primefaces tags are not being processed, so it looks like the classes are not available.p  pI am using WildFly 8.1 on Java 7 on Linux.p  pWhat am I missingp
Negative 4278 pI am developing an Universal Windows app. It contains a ListView to display a set of terms and their definitions. The ListView is bound to a DataSource.cs file in the XAML part. The ListView is showing correctly. p  pThere is a requirement to add a searchbox to filter out the ListView items as the keyword is typed in. I have confirmed that the searchbox is able to filter out the terms from the DataSource.cs by using strongDebug.Writelinestrong. p  pThe issue I am facing is that Im unable to hide the items which have not been selected by the searchbox. The actual searching is happening inside of a strongemforeachemstrong loop that contains an strongemifemstrong block. Hence, my idea was to hide the strongListView.slectedItemstrong in the corresponding strongemelseemstrong block. The trouble is that this approach throws an exception that says, p  blockquote   pA first chance exception of type System.Exception occurred in mscorlib.dll   An exception of type System.Exception occurred in mscorlib.dll but was not handled in user code   Additional information Catastrophic failure Exception from HRESULT 0x8000FFFF EUNEXPECTEDp      pThe program XXXX.exe has exited with code 1 0xffffffff.p blockquote  pHere I have provided the code.p  pstrongXAMLstrongp  precodeltListView xNameItemListView      Margin0,0,0,4      HeightAuto      ItemTemplateStaticResource MessageListImageTemplate      ShowsScrollingPlaceholdersFalse     ContainerContentChangingItemListViewContainerContentChanging     ItemClickItemListViewItemClick             IsItemClickEnabledTrue      SelectionModeNonegt          ltListView.ItemContainerStylegt             ltStyle TargetTypeListViewItemgt                 ltSetter PropertyHorizontalContentAlignment ValueStretch gt                 ltSetter PropertyPadding Value0,0,0,20gt             ltStylegt         ltListView.ItemContainerStylegt  ltListViewgt  ltSearchBox       xNamesearch      PlaceholderTextSearch for a term       SuggestionsRequestedsearchSuggestionsRequested      SearchHistoryEnabledFalse      Grid.Row1     HorizontalAlignmentLeft      VerticalAlignmentCenter      Margin50,0,0,0      Height50 gt codepre  pstrongCstrongp  precodeStoreData storeData  null  public MainPage      storeData  new StoreData      setting the ListView source to the sample data      ItemListView.ItemsSource  storeData.Collection       making sure the first item is the selected item     ItemListView.SelectedIndex  0              void ItemListViewContainerContentChangingListViewBase sender, ContainerContentChangingEventArgs args      ItemViewer iv  args.ItemContainer.ContentTemplateRoot as ItemViewer      if args.InRecycleQueue  true              iv.ClearData          else if args.Phase  0              iv.ShowTitleargs.Item as Item           Register for async callback to visualize Title asynchronously         args.RegisterUpdateCallbackContainerContentChangingDelegate          else if args.Phase  1              iv.ShowDescription         args.RegisterUpdateCallbackContainerContentChangingDelegate            For imporved performance, set Handled to true since app is visualizing the data item     args.Handled  true   private TypedEventHandlerltListViewBase, ContainerContentChangingEventArgsgt ContainerContentChangingDelegate      get              if delegate  null                      delegate  new TypedEventHandlerltListViewBase, ContainerContentChangingEventArgsgt                ItemListViewContainerContentChanging                      return delegate        private TypedEventHandlerltListViewBase, ContainerContentChangingEventArgsgt delegate  private void searchSuggestionsRequestedObject sender, SearchBoxSuggestionsRequestedEventArgs e       IEnumerableltItemgt suggestionList  IEnumerableltItemgtstoreData.Collection.CastltItemgt      string queryText  e.QueryText      if string.IsNullOrEmptyqueryText               Windows.ApplicationModel.Search.SearchSuggestionCollection suggestionCollection  e.Request.SearchSuggestionCollection          foreach Item suggestedItem in suggestionList                      String suggestion  suggestedItem.Title             Debug.WriteLinesuggestion              if suggestion.StartsWithqueryText, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase                              suggestionCollection.AppendQuerySuggestionsuggestion                            else                               this is the line throwing the exception                       ItemListView.Items.RemoveAtItemListView.SelectedIndex                              codepre  pI am new to Windows development.

Negative 4278 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pMy company is thinking about bringing R into our work environment in conjunction with RStudio. As part of the security checks, we have to compile each of the different CC files in a package to scan for possible security flaws. I know that the binaries are available, and I really wish that I could use them, but we have to compile ourselves. I have no R experience and a little experience with c from about 5 years ago. Im trying to compile emjustem the Rcpp C code and I dont know if this is possible.p  pstrongWhat Ive triedstrongp  pI first tried to compile using VisualStudio and found its not c99 compliant. I then tried cygwin and it didnt support codewstringscode. I have now installed ubuntu and am getting a lot of undefined reference errors when I compile. I know or at least I believe that Rcpp is designed to help use C in R.

Negative 4278 pI have some code in VB.net that cycles through a directory of documents .docx and updates them.p  pThe code is fine other than if there is one document in there that is considered as Originated from the Internet then the code stops since Word will by default open it in Protected View visibility is set to false deliberately.p  pNow, I know how to change the trust center settings, but I need my application to run on anyones machine  and the users my clientele are not likely to know how to do it.p  pIs there a way round thisp  pThanks. p  pEDITp  pIn a recent example, one of the files I tried to open with my code was added to the directory externally via an FTP by me. so when my code was cycling through all the docs in the directory, the code halted at this file since it had now Originated form the internet.p  pMy issue is that once the document is opened, the code needs to continue and edit the document but my code cannot do so as it opened in Protected view. As the word object is set to not be visible, this results in the code pausing for use input Ordinarily choosing to Edit the document but they cant see it to do so.p  pManually changing the Trust center settings is unfortunately not an option here, as this code is being run on hundreds of different machines by people who are not comfortable with changing it themselves  their perception is just that my code does not work,p  pHeres my code that cycle through a directory and inserts an image into the header of the document.

Negative 4278 pI am trying to create a game in iOS without using SpriteKit.  I am stuck in getting the sound effects to play in a timely manner. Ive been using the following code which I have found online and the background music plays great. However, when I use the  playSoundEffect method it plays ok the first time but then starts to lag behind and becomes out of sync. I guess that happens because it initializes an AVAudioPlayer every time.

Negative 4278 pIm using NetBeans 8.0.1. Ive also used a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12163292phpdocdoesnotseemtorecognizeglobalvariablesinoutputwhatamidoingwrthis article to try and solve my problema.   p  pPHPDoc allows us to specify the names and types of global variables. However, Im not sure if Im doing something wrong or if Ive run into a limitation of PHPDoc.p  pMy problem is the following. I have a PHP file called Constants.php which contains a global variable called DATABASE, which is instantiated to an instance of my Database class stored in Database.php. The Database class is located in the codeCorecode namespace i.e. codeCoreDatabasecode. I use autoloading for all my classes.p  pBasically, I want NetBeans to show autocompletehints for all functionsproperties in the Database class as it would if I declared codeDATABASE  new Databasecode. In that scenario typing codeDATABASEgtcode would show a list of functions I can use.p  pHowever, I cant seem to get this working right. When I document my global DATABASE like sobr codeFile Constants.php           The instance of the database module.      global CoreDatabase DATABASE      name DATABASE ltI tried both with and without the name tag          DATABASEcodebr and my function like so assume the function is wrapped in class MyClassbr codeFile MyClass.php           My function description.      global CoreDatabase The database instance.          public function MyFunction              global DATABASE         DATABASEgtConnect     code  p  pIn the example as given above, when I run autocomplete ctrlspace on the codeDATABASEgtConnectcode line it tells me that the DATABASE variable refers to code DATABASE MyClass.phpcode type name class, which is the wrong class, and more importantly, misses the type. And while the function call works, the autocomplete and parameter hinting dont, which removes a big advantage of using PHPDoc.p  pOn the other hand, if I change the function documentation tobr code           My function description.      global CoreDatabase DATABASE The database instance.          public function MyFunction              global DATABASE         DATABASEgtConnect     codebr it tells me that the DATABASE variable refers to codeDatabase DATABASE MyClass.phpcode, which is still the wrong class, but at least contains the type. At this point autocomplete works.p  pMy issue is that according to the PHPDoc documentation and the thread I linked above, that usage is wrong. Also, it should tell me it found DATABASE in Constants.php.p  pThis all leads me to the problem I cant work around I also want the autocomplete when I use the DATABASE global outside of a class, and outside of Constants.php. I currently dont see any way to get it to display autocomplete when using it like thisbr codeFile MyOtherFile.php     namespace Core              DATABASEgtConnect     codep  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. It may just be Im trying to push PHPDoc to its limits, it may be PHPDoc doesnt support hinting on custom classes doesnt seem likely seeing as that I can get it to work sometimes, or I might just be doing something wrong.p  pAny help here would be strongextremelystrong appreciated.p

Negative 4278 pIm writing a program that needs to have Command Objects. A Command contains a String for its name, and an AbstractAction that represents what the Command actually does. Furthermore, a Command has a method, init, used higher up in the programs hierarchy that instantiates variables for the Commands use to provide access to the GUI, network, and so on, and a method, execute, that executes the AbstractAction on a special Thread. Here is an example of creating and using a Commandp  precodeCommand c  new CommandTest,  new AbstractAction      public void actionPerformedActionEvent a          System.out.printlnHello world       codepre  pAt this point, calling c.execute will print out Hello world, as expected.p  pMy goal is to have a text file with pairs of values, which can be parsed to generate a String name and an AbstractAction action. Once that has been done, another class will go through the found names and actions, create Command Objects for each one, and add them to the list of commands in the program, where they can then be used as normal. p  pRight now, my problem is that I read in a String that represents the body of the private AbstractAction above but there isnt an easy way to actually convert the String into an actual AbstractAction Object. p  pOne potential idea was creating a temporary java file with the AbstractAction String representation, compiling it, creating a new AbstractAction from it, and then get that reference using reflection, but that seems like overkill. Another was to directly modify the source of the file that parses through the file, so that it would have the code of the AbstractAction written out, but again, this is a bit crazy.p  pIve tried a few other implementations, including forcing the user to create a subclass of Command, putting their source into a special program folder, and then creating the Commands on initialisation, but this ended up being a lot of work for the user lots of redundant code.p  pPlease let me know if theres a better way to implement what I want to do or if theres an easier way to turn the String of the source into an inner Object as above. p  pEdit 1 Here is an example of what the text file would look likep  precodeAnything outside of quotes is a comment Foo, System.out.printlnHello world Bar, network.sendOverAFilenew Filetest.txt codepre  pFrom here, the parser on startup would read through the file and extract Foo as a String name, and System ...  as a String action. I need to turn action into the code in the body of the AbstractAction, as seen above when creating the Command. The same would be done for Bar Bar uses one of the variables passed by init.p  pAs for the subclass implementation I tried, the user would have to create their own subclass of Command, and put it into a source folder. A subclass would look something like thisp  precodepublic class TestCommand extends Command      public TestCommand          superTest, new AbstractAction              public void actionPerformedActionEvent a                  System.out.printlnHello                             codepre  pThis would then be put into a source directory, among every other subclassed Command, and compiled. The parser would go through the compiled code segments, and add the relevant information to an array. Every time a Command would normally be executed, the parser scans through the list of all names, and if there is a match, execute the relevant AbstractAction. This works, but involves a ton of references to external classes which will probably slow down the program with dozens of commands, and is two or three times as much work for the users making the plugin. As a result, I felt it would be much easier to use the text file technique above, but I dont know how to turn a String representation of the code into the code itself Ergo my initial question.p

Negative 4278 pI have a timer in my ASP.NET code using C that I am immediately changing its Interval for, however it never actually sticks when running on the server.  The timer continues to fire every 10 seconds.  I want it to fire after the first 10 seconds, execute my code codeLoadReportcode, but then wait 5 minutes to fire every other time.  The strange thing is debugging on my local machine it behaves exactly as expected, just not on the server where it will be running.  What am I doing wrongp  pstrongUPDATEstrong  This appears to be a ViewState problem, however I dont know how to fix it.  Not only is the timer not keeping its interval, but when I make charts on the page Visible they are not becoming visible.  Its as if on the server any dynamic code changes to the view of the page are being ignored, but not in development.

These are the steps of this conditionp  ol liCreate one object It stays in memory for some reason, although its usage obviously limited to ButtonClick method.

By this time the Generation 2 grows up, mostly because of DataBindingEngine hashtable Why, by the wayli liReplicate the first step.li liForce GC.Collect a few times.li ol  pBy doing this steps we reach Snapshot 2. Forcing GC to collect at any other time doesnt give any results. One more thing  if an application is build as a x32 it crashes with a StackOverFlow exception on a big amount of objects created. If its build as a x64  the second generation fills up all the memory availlable.p  pSo, I have a feeling that its not an intended behaviour. Could someone, please, highlight this situationp

I have been going back and forth between methods but I am super confused now. Can anyone help me outp

Negative 4278 pSo im having a small issue that seems to arise when getting a negative value back if the number isnt found in an array. Im instructed to essentially take the negative number of where it should be which would be 7 if it belongs in the 7th index space and make it a positive index number.p  pHere is the exact descriptionp  precode STEP 2 if the return value is negative then you realize that the number was not           found in the array and this negative number is an encoded index of where the           number belongs.  You must decode this index back to the real index it represents.           You do this by doing the opposite operations in the reverse order they were done in           when bsearch encoded the index. Once you have a non negative index you can go to           the next step.   codepre

Negative 4278 pI have Jersey 2.15 service deployed in tomcat 8 on Windows, which receives POST requests and handles them async via resuming AsyncResponse and then returns ID to the client.

Negative 4278 pi have a weird bug in my app that ive been working over two months. I know i should maybe paste some code but its probably pointless at this moment cause the bug spreads all over the application. Maybe its silly but it drives me mad cause I cant move forward from here. Maybe someone encountered the same problem and know whats up. Im pretty desperate at this moment and really dont know what to do.p  pthe thing is  wherever i want to put a text box, its always disabled. It doesnt work anywhere. Every other control im using works perfectly, but the textboxes just stopped working. I have no idea... the text boxes ive had in the app, on other pages, work perfectly. Im creating new pages and the boxes are always disabled on them. I know that the question is pretty general but i have no idea even which part of code to show, since the app is pretty big right now. Its really frustrating. Maybe im lucky and anybody has even a slightest idea of why the control can stop working on whole application all of the suddenp  pUPDATEp  pso what ive just realised is that the textbox usability depends on the container. It doesnt work in stackpanels and grids, but it does in listview. still dont know why though..p

Negative 4278 pI have an app that has a toolbar, but I dont want the bar at the top, in order to free more viewing space. Therefore I have decided not to use a navigation controller. Id like to add a back button to the toolbar. How would I go about this p  pAdding the button is easy enough, and setting the action to performSeguWithIdentifier is all fine, but what happens is that the previous view just gets loaded again, rather than show it as it was, like a true back button. So if I tap on the 10th row on a tableView and go to a new page, when I press the back button it loads the view from the top again, instead of showing it as where I scrolled down to last. p  pAny help would be most appreciated p

Negative 4278 pIm currently working on a small project, refurbishing and potentially implementing new features for a software created  sometime in 2008 in Borland C Builder. The software is obviously full of the Borland or VCL specific classes and to edit it I would need Borland C. p  pDue to company regulations it seems that I may not be able to get hold of Borland C Builder, therefore I would need to recreate the whole program in Visual Studio, which I have access to VS2010. Planning the project I thought this would be a sensible thing to do anyway, considering Borlands history.p  pNow heres where it gets tricky I have very little OOP experience and have barely started learning C and Visual C. The program itself is only a few hundred lines and I feel that I am capable of learning the language to an extent that I can tweak the code and potentially add a few new things to it within a reasonable time frame I have about 8 weeks to finish this. Over the past few days I have read through the code and understood most of it including how the Borland specific things worked, in addition to learning enough about C to work at this stage. However, I am now lost trying to decide how to proceed, whether I should start working with Windows Forms, use MFC or do something completely different. p  pFrom what I understand, the .NET framework works best with C, but I think its nearly impossible for me to learn C parallel to C now and also learn it to an extent that I can migrate a program from the latter to the former. If possible, I would like to keep as much of the current code, as possible.p  pI also think that if I work with Windows Forms and .NET even if I use CCLI instead of C, not having a native end result could be an issue for the company. The whole program is only a few MB, having to install the .NET bundle would be silly and potentially problematic. However, I am a bit concerned that MFC would be complex and very different to Borland C VCL classes and I may struggle to understand it, while the Windows Forms building process is fairly straightforward. At the moment I am reading Ivor Hortons Beginning Visual C 2010, but I havent yet found an answer from it or from other posts here.p  pstrongConsidering the abovestrongp  ol liWhat would be best now, should I start working with Windows Forms and create something fast with CCLI or should I use MFCli liOut of these two, which would be easier to learn and use with the limited knowledge I haveli liWhich one of the two would enable me to keep most of the original codeli liWould there be any point to try to learn C as wellli liIs there any other advice you could give related to my problemli ol

Negative 4278 pIm trying to speed up some matrix inversion in a model Im building, specifically by implementing some linear algebra routines in Cython.

In other words, Id like to modify the Cython function so that it only requires that I pass the array to be inverted.p  pMy questions are a Will this lead to speed improvements even small ones and, assuming it will, b how do I go about it defining the pivot and identity arrays in Cython directlyp

Negative 4278 pIm using Eclipse Mars on an Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine running in VirtualBox. Currently Im trying to debug initdb of postgresql after Ive change some code. Now initdb is starting correctly in the debugger.p  pThe problem When I set a breakpoint in certain source files, this breakpoint gets set and the little blue dot appears in the column on the left of the editor. But The gdb process prints the following error message on the console No source file named P., where P equals the path of the source file, in which I set the breakpoint. Furthermore, the debugger doesnt halt the program execution at such a breakpoint.p  pThis kind of problem Ive seen quite a lot while I tried to find a solution, but what makes my situation different is this The problem I described above doesnt appear with all source files in my project folder. Its only with some source files and in others I can set working breakpoints without any problem.p  pI appreciate any help.p
Negative 4278 pSo I have an app that has long intensive processes by its nature...

So I cant up date my users as to what the app is doing... Since the app appears to be crashed at this point.p  pIve looked into using an Async task but from my understanding it only can use 10 of the phones processing power which would increase run times...  p  pDoes Android have an accepted way of handling this Or is there some form of an onUILoaded event I can tie intop

Negative 4278 pI have a little problem with form data caching keeping it in a variable before its actually saved to a file. I have a pretty simple form layout  p  ol liObjectComboli liParamCombo1li liParamCombo2li liParamText1li liParamCombo3li liSaveButtonli ol  pThis form is meant to configure certain parameters for specific objects in my program. The list of all the objects is in the ObjectCombo. And the parameters are in the other form fields. Whenever I pick another object from the ObjectCombo I want the parameters entered for that object to be cached until I have configured every object in the ObjectCombo list. After everything is configured Id like to press the SaveButton so that every cached parameter for every object in ObjectCombo gets saved at once.p  pMy solution this far is that I created a Dictionary with int index of the object in the ObjectCombo as key and another dictionary with parameter name as key and parameter value as value.br    codeDictionaryltint, Dictionaryltstring, stringgtgtcode  p  pI will do the caching in ObjectCombo SelectedIndexChanged event and thus when I have configured the last element and clicked Save the last element does not get saved because no SelectedIndexChanged event was fired. Of course I could go back to a different object in ObjectCombo and that would solve the problem but thats not user friendly. Is there a different event I could subscribe to that lets me cache the config data before moving to a different objectp  pIs my approach to this challenge even reasonable Ive messed around with this problem for a day and everything Ive done sounds so simple but since English is not my native language I might have a problem articulating myself. If anyone interested in helping is having problems understanding what Im trying to achieve dont hesitate to ask more information.    p
