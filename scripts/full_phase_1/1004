Positive 1004 pPlease consider the icons bellow.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comiz2Vt.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiz2Vt.png altIconsap  pThats a screeshot of my Android 5.0 phone. On my 4.4.4 phone, the icon to the right MOVEME has a transparent background. The icon is symply the colorful ring with a transparent hole. Also on my 4.4.4 the WhatsApp icon is symply the talk baloon, withough the green background around it. My app icon has a symilar style as the MOVEME one, and the same happens, the system fills the transparent parts of the icon so it becomes the same shape of all the others. Im guessing that is the reason WhatsApp added the green background, to prevent this from happening. And this leads me to my questions. 1 What is the standard shape for Android 5.0 launcher icons 2 How can I choose icons depending on the Android API of the device Like WhatsAppp

Negative 1004 pI have a pretty complex object graph codeGcode with an object codeo1code in codeGcode. codeGcode is to be written into a database using NHibernate. However, if there already is a persistent entry of codeo1code lets call it codeo1pcode  in the database, I substitute codeo1code for codeo1pcode. Hence there should be no redundant entries in the database. Now I let NHibernate do its job and afterwards I look into the database. Now I have exactly the situation I tried to avoid. There are entries for the original codeo1pcode object plus codeo1code in the database. The only explanation I have so far is that codeo1code is reachable via another route in codeGcode so hibernate puts it into the database. Is there a way I can determine if this is the case, i.e. can I ask the garbage collector how many references there are to codeo1code. Or to speak in graph language How many incoming edges does codeo1code havep

Negative 1004 pSometimes, while sending a large amount of data via SocketChannel.write, the underlying TCP buffer gets filled up, and I have to continually retry the write until the data is all sent.p  pSo, I might have something like thisp  precodepublic void sendByteBuffer bb, SocketChannel sc    sc.writebb    while bb.remaininggt0       Thread.sleep10       sc.writebb                codepre  pThe problem is that the occasional issue with a large ByteBuffer and an overflowing underlying TCP buffer means that this call to send will block for an unexpected amount of time.  In my project, there are hundreds of clients connected simultaneously, and one delay caused by one socket connection can bring the whole system to a crawl until this one delay with one SocketChannel is resolved.  When a delay occurs, it can cause a chain reaction of slowing down in other areas of the project, and having low latency is important.p  pI need a solution that will take care of this TCP buffer overflow issue transparently and without causing everything to block when multiple calls to SocketChannel.write are needed.  I have considered putting send into a separate class extending Thread so it runs as its own thread and does not block the calling code.  However, I am concerned about the overhead necessary in creating a thread for EACH socket connection I am maintaining, especially when 99 of the time, SocketChannel.write succeeds on the first try, meaning theres no need for the thread to be there.  In other words, putting send in a separate thread is really only needed if the while loop is used  only in cases where there is a buffer issue, perhaps 1 of the time  If there is a buffer issue only 1 of the time, I dont need the overhead of a thread for the other 99 of calls to send.p  pI hope that makes sense... I could really use some suggestions.  Thanksp

True Smart Indent, on the other hand, is quite possibly the most technically challenging task Ive had to implement in the IDE to date, and Ive implemented my fair share. Even fullblown onthefly automatic code reformatting is easier it just defers to Smart Indent for the heavy lifting.p  pIm looking for highlevel discussions of general purpose Smart Indent algorithms. strongIn particular, Im looking for either research on smart indent strategies, or an objective description of all normal and edge cases that could be tested to ensure repeatable, bugfree results.strong Eventually, Id like to provide both a detailed workflow of the functionality, a concrete foundation for actually implementing the feature, and finally assembling a languagespecific version from that and integrating it into my language services.p  pPS Visual Studio 2010s C editor has several small bugs in this feature. Having implemented it myself, I have a whole new respect for the work it takes to polish it.p  pstrongEdit 825strong I managed to a hrefhttpwww.280z28.orgdownloadsvsx20090825SmartIndent.pdfwrite down a draft the rulesa for how I think things should be handled when the smart indent is inside a code comment. Ill probably be working from a CC perspective on the rules, but later they should be able to be parameterized for aspects of other languages.p

Negative 1004 pIm currently introducing Prism to a new Wpf application, and am using the MVVM pattern. My initial approach of structuring the Wpf application was to add one project to hold the model classes, one to hold the viewmodel classes, etc. These might be split at a later time to avoid having different logical components in the same project. However, this strikes me as a bad structure when using Prism and parhaps in general... p  pIn Prism you want to structure things into different logical modules  where anything related to the same things would be placed in the same module. So this tells me I should put all related to a logical part of my application into a module for this part. This might hold some different views for this component, the related view model, and the necessary model classes. Using this approach I would however get the model scattered around my solution. As the model will be tied to a database this strikes me as a possibly bad approach after all. I am using NHibernate, so the database wont really be that visual though. p  pSo I see three different structures. Are any of these typically desired Or is there a different way I should structure my application p  ol liProjects Model, ViewModel, and also one to hold UserControls. Etc.. li liOne project pr logical part  including both related view, viewmodel and model for this part. li liOne project pr logical part  including view and viewmodel, but the model being defined in a separate project. Maybe even one project for all model classes if they have a logical relationship. li ol  pAny opinions are greatly appreciated p

Negative 1004 pMy normal development platform for PHP is Linux.  I use a Red hat server for my website, my company uses red hat and Fedora for production, and I have Ubuntu at home.  I couldnt be happier.  Unfortunately, Im now required to spend a good deal of time working in PHP in Windows using WAMP.p  pI say this is unfortunate because I am continually finding things which Linux supports which Windows does not.  Last year, it actually delayed a project when we realized that WAMP used an earlier version of PHP this has been fixed by the port of 5.3 to Windows.  Today, I just learned that codecheckdnsrrcode is not ported to Windows, and the entire codepcntlcode library is unavailable.p  pSo, my questions is this bIs there anywhere which tells me the current differences between Windows and Linux regarding PHPbp  pIm not looking for idiosyncrasies, such as those found in the comments a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.mysqlconnect.php relnofollowherea though those would be nice, but rather which functions will not be available under Windows which are available under Linux.p  p EDIT p  pThere have been two commentsstatments which say thatcodecheckdnsrrcode exists in 5.3 under Windows.  Technically, this is correct.  PHP will not say that the function does not exist.  I dont know if this is the case with all installs or just WAMP, but while yes, it may say that it works, the function does not work as it does in Linux.p  p UPDATE p  pIt does not look like there is a good answer possible to this question, but I have found a workaround thanks to one of the suggestions belowp  pPlace this on the production environment.  REMEMBER TO FORCE SOME FORM OF SECURITY ON THIS.p  precode ltphp printr getdefinedfunctions  gt codepre  pThen run this on the dev environment.  it will output all of the functions which are exclusive to the local environment.p  precoderoot  filegetcontents ltpath to servergtavailable.php  root  pregreplace [[09]1,4]sgts,   , root  tmp   internal gt array root  explode n, substr root, strpos root, tmp   strlen tmp   1   arrayshift root  arrayshift root  internal  getdefinedfunctions internal  internal[ internal ]  function trimarray array root       nroot  array     foreach root as keygtvalue                 value  trim value            if pregmatch [azAZ][aeiouy][azAZ09], value  ampamp                pregmatch [azAZ]md5crcn12strsqrtch[az]rdltntftppng[azAZ], value                              echo n key                       else                         nroot[]  value                      return nroot   root      trimarray root  internal  trimarray internal   diff  arrayvalues arraydiff root, internal   foreach diff as key gt fname         if inarray fname, root                      echo [key] gt fname lt foreign server only              else                    echo [key] gt fname lt local                    echo n  codepre

Negative 1004 pI am using BOOSTPP for to do precompile computations in the preprocessor. I am focusing on an application where code size is strongextremelystrong important to me. So please dont say the compiler emshouldem or emusuallyem does that, I need to control what is performed at compile time and what code is generated. However, I want to be able to use the same name of the macrofunction for both integer constants and variables. As trivial example, I can havep  precodedefine TWICEn BOOSTPPMULn,2 .....  somewhere else in code int a  TWICE5 codepre  pThis does what I want it to, evaluating to p  precodeint a  10 codepre  pduring compile time.p  pHowever, I also want it to be used atp  precodeint b  5 int a  TWICEb codepre  pThis should be preprocessed to p  precodeint b  5 int a  5  2 codepre  pOf course, I can do so by using the traditional macros likep  precodedefine TWICEn n  2 codepre  pBut then it doesnt do what I want it to do for integer constants evaluating them during compile time. p  pSo, my question is, is there a trick to check whether the argument is a literal or a variable, and then use different definitions. i.e., something like thisp  precodedefine TWICEn BOOSTPPIF ISCONSTANTn,                                BOOSTPPMULn,2,                                n  2  codepre  pedit So what I am really after is some way to check if something is a constant available at compile time, and hence a good argument for the BOOSTPP functions. I realize that this is different from what most people expect from a preprocessor and general programming recommendations. But there is no emwrongem way of programming, so please dont hate on the question if you disagree with its philosophy. There is a reason the BOOSTPP library exists, and this question is in the same spirit. It might just not be possible though.p

Negative 1004 pIm still learning mockito and right now Im learning how to inject mocks.p  pI have an object under test with a particular method that depends on other objects.  Those objects, in turn, depend on other objects.  I want to mock certain things and have those mocks be used everywhere during executionthroughout the control flow of the method.p  pFor example assume there are classes likep  precodepublic class GroceryStore      public double inventoryValue  0.0     private shelf  new Shelf5     public void takeInventory          forItem item  shelf              inventoryValue  item.price                 public class Shelf extends ArrayListltItemgt      private ProductManager manager  new ProductManager     public Shelfint aisleNumber         supermanager.getShelfContentsaisleNumber        public class ProductManager      private Apple apple     public void setAppleApple newApple          apple  newApple          public CollectionltItemgt getShelfContentsint aisleNumber          return Arrays.asListapple, apple, apple, apple, apple       codepre  pI need to write test code with portions along the lines ofp  precode.... Mock private Apple apple ...  whenapple.price.thenReturn10.0 ...   ... InjectMocks private GroceryStore store  new GroceryStore ... Test public void testTakeInventory     store.takeInventory    assertEquals50.0, store.inventoryValue  codepre  pWhenever apple.price is called, I want my mock apple to be the one used.  Is this possiblep  pEDITbr Important note...br the class that contains the object I want to mock does have a setter for that object.  However, I dont really have a handle to that class at the level Im testing.  So, following the example, although ProductManager has a setter for Apple, I dont have a way of getting the ProductManager from the GroceryStore object.p

I have two entities one is Person and the other is Image. the relationship from Person  to Image is tomany and from Image to Person I got inverse relationship as well.p  pAll I need at the moment is to strongemadd multiple number of images taken from iphone camera or chosen from library to one Person entityemstrong.p  pId like to know whether there is any kind of sample code that deals with tomany relationship with UIImage using Core Data.p  pmany thanks.p  pp  pActually I wish I could specify the problem. What im trying to do is using access methods that are given for free in tomany relationship to add object such as p  precode voidaddPersonImageObjectPersonImage value codepre  pand also Ive implemented methods related to ImageToDataTransformer. p  pI spent almost a week on this matter and I think I need a guiding sample code that I can study first for my add project.p
Negative 1004 pIm using mssql server 2008 and having a problem with a trigger. Now, i have this aspx page, which has a stored procedure working in a button click, and that stored procedure has an execute permission for the user, lets says x. this procedure insert some values to a table on one db. and that table has a trigger for insert, which should insert those values to some tables at other databases.p  pAs i said, the stored procedure has an execute permission for the user x, and the same user have insertupdatedeleteselect permissions on the tables that the trigger should do the insert to.p  pBut when someone with an x permission starts the procedure, heshe gets this exception message  codeCannot find the object DatabaseName..tablename because it does not exist or you do not have permissions.codep  pBut i know that database and table name is correct.p  pSo i am thinking, maybe it has something to do with the table having permissions but i am not sure of course.p  pAny help with be appreciated, thanks.p
Negative 1004 pI have an app I distribute over Cydia. Its nothing hacky, just a GUI to connect to a web API.p  pThe last time I submitted an update was before SDK 4.0, I used the instructions available a hrefhttpthebigboss.orghostingrepositorysubmityourappcompileforcydiasubmission relnofollowherea to build it from Xcode without signing and, used codeldidcode on OSX terminal to sign it. Everything worked just fine.p  pNow when Im building using the 4.2 SDK exactly like I used to do, the nocodesigning and codeldidcode still works, and I can run it on a 4.2 device, but the app wont run on a 3.1.3 Device just shows Default.png and crashes. If I build amp run from Xcode, on the other hand, it runs just fine on any Device, from iOS 3.0 to 4.2. So I dont think this could be a issue with libraries or linking, but with the code signing.p  pOn project settings, I have 4.2 as the base SDK and 3.0 as the deployment target.p  pThis is what I get on the console if I try to start the app on a 3.0 iPhone 2G Devicep  precodekernel[0] ltDebuggt seatbelt hook..execve killing pid 913 outside of container ampamp icanhasdebugger SpringBoard[162] ltWarninggt Failed to spawn MyApp. Unable to obtain a task name port right for pid 913 oskern failure com.apple.launchd[1] ltNoticegt UIKitApplicationorg.lobato.MyApp[0xaa9d] Exited Killed com.apple.launchd[1] ltWarninggt UIKitApplicationorg.lobato.MyApp[0xaa9d] Throttling respawn Will start in 2147483647 seconds SpringBoard[162] ltWarninggt Application MyApp exited abnormally with signal 9 Killed codepre  pAnyone got some experience in this area that maybe could point me in the right directionp  pThanksp

Negative 1004 pIm using the MVVMLight toolkit and storing my ViewModelLocator in App.Resources.

In column one, I have a table.  In column 2, I have a text box.  The idea is that the textbox fills the height of the table in column one.p  pThis is fine for the initial view.  Other views of this report will hide Row 3.  When Row 3 is hidden, the Textbox stays the same size.  The desired behavior is to shrink the textbox in column two to match the new height of the table.  I assume it is actually the row height of the parent row that is not changing when the content changes.p  pAny ideas on how to get my desired affect  I thought about making the default row size really small and expanding as necessary, but this is not desirable because the inner table should have explicit row heights.p

Negative 1004 pOK, Im sure somebody, somewhere must have come up with an algorithm for this already, so I figured Id ask before I go off to reinvent it myself.p  pI have a list of arbitrary userentered nonempty text strings.  Each string can be any length except 0, and theyre all unique.  I want to display them to the user, but I want to trim them to some fixed length that I decide, and replace part of them with an ellipsis ....

And I guess it could ellipsize more than one place in the string, but within reason  maybe 2 times would be OK, but 3 or more seems excessive.  Or maybe the number of times isnt as important as the size of the chunks that remain less than about 5 characters between ellipses would be rather pointless.p  pThe inputs both number and size wont be terribly large, so performance is not a major concern well, as long as the algorithm doesnt try something silly like enumerating all possible strings until it finds a set that works.p  pI guess these requirements seem pretty specific, but Im actually fairly lenient  Im just trying to describe what I have in mind.p  pHas something like this been done before  Is there some existing algorithm or library that does this  Ive googled some but found nothing quite like this so far but maybe Im just bad at googling.  I have to believe somebody somewhere has wanted to solve this problem alreadyp

Negative 1004 pI have a rather strange problem that I cant quite get to the bottom of just yet, and I want to document it here because I havent seen this problem discussed anywhere else.p  pI have a iPhone app that I was developing under Xcode3. This was working perfectly and I had done some adhoc distribution that also worked perfectly on devices.p  pThen I upgraded to Xcode4 and the next time I did an adhoc distribution my app crashed on startup. Needless to say that it worked in the simulator and in devices hooked up to my development machine. The crash logs were none too helpful, they indicated a crash in main.m, in the standard call to UIApplication. I, of course, had never changed that file. After much digging and piecing together I discovered the problem.p  pXcode thought that the file type of my .xib files was text.xml instead of file.xib and so was only copying these files to the app bundle instead of compiling them. The app was then crashing on startup because it couldnt find the MainWindow.nib file.p  pBy tracing back through my subversion checkins I found that the file types, as recorded in the project.pbxproj file within xcodeproj, changed in the first checkin after the Xcode4 upgrade. I have no idea as to how or why that happened. Nor I can see through the UI how I would influence that setting and I didnt even open some of the xibs that changed. To fix my problem I modified the pbxproj file in a text editor.p  pSo, does anyone have any insight as to how or why this could have happenedp

Negative 1004 pstrongTHE PROBLEMstrongp  pI have an NSScrollView. Im using it to implement a custom Table View with rows of data that are actually NSViews. Note this is not an instance of NSTableView.p  pAs I scroll vertically there is no horizontal scrolling, I use a boundsChanged notification to add as subviews of the scrollViews contentView the NSViews that become visible the ones with frames that intersect the scrollViews document visible rect and to remove the ones that are no longer visible frames outside of the scrollViews visible rect.p  pThe process works wonderfully except when it comes to inertial scrolling. If I have my cursor over cell X and I flick the trackpad to scroll downwards FAST with inertia, cell X quickly leaves the visible rect and, as such, is removed from the scrollViews contentView. BUT, that kills inertial scrolling. If I do NOT remove cell X as a subView, then inertial scrolling works perfectly.p  pstrongWHAT I NEEDstrongp  pA way to keep inertial scrolling while still removing the NSView that the cursor happened to be on top of when the user started the scrolling gesture.p  pstrongWHAT IVE TRIEDstrongp  pIve looked at NSResponders methodp  precodescrollWheelNSEvent theEvent  codepre  pThe default implementation passes scrollWheel to the next responder. So, I subclassed NSScrollView and implemented this method to try to stop it from passing the scrollWheel event to the individual subViews inside the scrollViews contentView. Didnt work. p  pSo then I went into my NSViews the ones Im adding to the contentView and overrode scrollWheel to pass the event back to the scrollView itself. Didnt work. p  pI still get scrolling in both cases, but not with inertia. p  pAny ideas Thanksp

Negative 1004 pI am developing an iPhone application which streams datae.x.ECGData like points from a server and displaysmeans Plotting it on the screen  i.e., live streaming. For that purpose, I am using codeNSURLConnectioncode. p  pThe problem I am facing is that, since the data is coming so speedily from the server to the iPhone, the cache buffer is increasing rapidly, causing the displayed data to lag behind the actual data coming from the server. After some time, the application goes too slowly, and gets a memory warning.p  pSo my question is, how should I handle this data coming from the server Should I continue with codeNSURLConnectioncode or go for lower level socket programmingp

Negative 1004 pI have been using the Build Deployment Package BDP for short from visual studios 2010 for several months now. It works great and has done the basic requirements that we have wanted.p  pI decided to take it a step further and figure out how to get my custom configuration so it can be modified in the Project.SetParameters.xml file generated by the BDP.  The way we use this is we build this deployment package, and deliver it to a customers server.   Each server may be different, so we keep the SetParameters.xml on the server and just replace the zip file for upgrades later. We use the WebDeploy tool to deploy it with the supplied cmd file created by Build Deployment Package. p  pI started working on this transform web config which is quite cool, but I dont think I am totally getting it. I can get it to do items that are normal within the web.config such as connection string, web server settings, etc, however I cant for the life of me get it to generate Parameters for config sections that are part of other DLLs included in the web.config.

Negative 1004 pI have a simple app that has two fragments and when in landscape mode, both fragments are shown side by side and in portrait I show Fragment A and then if they select an option, start an Activity that shows Fragment B.  My problem is when I am in Portrait mode and showing Fragment B, if the user selects a menu option I want to refresh or redraw the View that is associated with Fragment B and cant understand how to make this work.  I tried the getView method and getLayoutInflater method but the screen doesnt change because I think I am creating a new view.  I also tried to get a reference to Fragment A thinking I could call its routine to build a new fragment and replace Fragment B but cant get a reference to it because it is not being displayed.  What I really need to do is just force the onCreateView method to be called again to inflate the new view but I have tried several methods to try to do this but cant get the onCreateView to be called again.  Any thoughts on how to thisp

Negative 1004 pI intend to use Netty in an upcoming project. This project will act as both client and server. Especially it will establish and maintain many connections to various servers while at the same time serving its own clients. p  pNow, the documentation for a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orgnetty3.2apiorgjbossnettychannelsocketnioNioServerSocketChannelFactory.html relnofollowNioServerSocketChannelFactorya fairly specifies the threading model for the server side of things fairly well  each bound listen port will require a dedicated embossem thread throughout the process, while connected clients will be handled in a nonblocking fashion on emworkerem threads. Specifically, one worker thread will be able to handle multiple connected clients. p  pHowever, the documentation for a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orgnetty3.2apiorgjbossnettychannelsocketnioNioClientSocketChannelFactory.html relnofollowNioClientSocketChannelFactorya is less specific. This also seems to utilize both embossem and emworkerem threads. However, the documentation statesp  blockquote   pOne NioClientSocketChannelFactory has one boss thread. It makes a connection attempt on request. Once a connection attempt succeeds, the boss thread passes the connected Channel to one of the worker threads that the NioClientSocketChannelFactory manages.p blockquote  pWorker threads seem to function in the same way as for the server case too. p  pMy question is, does this mean that there will be one dedicated embossem thread for each connection from my program to an external server How will this scale if I establish hundreds, or thousands of such connections p  pAs a side note. Are there any adverse side effects for reusing a single Executor cached thread pool as both the embossExecutorem and emworkerExecutorem for a ChannelFactory What about also reusing between different client andor server ChannelFactory instances a hrefhttpnettyforumsandmailinglists.685743.n2.nabble.comEffectiveuseofthreadpoolinserverclientsetuptd6613378.html relnofollowThis is somewhat discussed herea, but I do not find those answers specific enough.

In this manner, a single codeXCopyAreacode containing the changed area is performed stronglocallystrong on the server that is, the display.pli lipHow should actual changes on the visual display be synchronized to avoid artefacts that where not present in the graphics described The irregular flicker you see is not a privilege of PostScript, it seems to be present in any doublebuffered system I have seen so far.

Negative 1004 pIm using Caliburn Micro for my project, and I decided to use Fluent Ribbon as part of the UI. My ShellView is really simple, and its laid out like thisp  ul liRibbon Control with 4 tabs.li liActiveItem.li ul  pThe Active item is dynamically changed depending on the Ribbons selected tab.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pWhat is the proper way to use Ribbon control as a second view for my currently active ViewModel ActiveItem, while maintaining modularity and all the goodies which come inherit with CM itself Also, what would it take to share my Ribbon control among my ViewModelsp  pstrongDetailsstrongp  pMy ShellViewModel is of type emConductor.Collection.OneActiveem, and it changes the ActiveItem to specific ViewModel I associate with selected tab when event is fired.p  pMy Ribbon is defined in XAML like thisp  precodeltContentControl xNameRibbonBar MicroView.ModelBinding ActiveItem MicroView.ContextRibbon gt codepre  pAs it shows, Ribbon control is bound to currently active item as its context view. That actually works for one view, because due to default CMs conventions, where it looks for the contextual views in the sub namespace e.g. if my path to the view is emViews.TasksTabViewem, it will look for the Context view at emViews.TasksTab.Ribbonem.p  pProblem is, when I change the ActiveItem, context view cant be located anymore, due to the different namespace, so It only works for one Tab.p  pIve also tried writing my own ViewLocator convention but I had no success with it.p  pThank you. p

The reader connects perfectly fine because I keep one memory map fixed for passing the new map names.

Negative 1004 pI am running a Joomla 1.6 site, which I recently moved to a new server.  I moved the site file system using rsync, and I replicated the MySQL database using MySQL utilities. The previous server has running Ubuntu server 10.10 and the new one is Ubuntu Server 11.10. Everything seems to be working correctly, except one thing...p  pIn the site configuration, a users session is set to expire after 24 hours.  On the previous site it had been working correctly.  On this new site, I have found that after a user logs in successfully and uses the site for some time, the user is logged out intermittently randomly, well before 24 hours, and then upon logging back in to the site even in the backend the site is completely blank.  The main menu is not there and there is no content. The logout button still appears, however, and the main banner. If the user logs out and then logs back in, usually all the content appears again like it should, and the site continues to function properly until the next time the session is booted.p  pDoes anybody have any experience with this  Is there a place a can start debugging to find out why the session is ended abruptly  Why can I log in to the site and still not see any contentp

Negative 1004 pWe have a list of items and we need to allow the user to select more than one of them.  Instead of just using the default html select element with the multiselect attribute we would like to use the jQuery UI selectable interaction.  We have it all wired up and it works great except if the list of items is long, we put it inside a div that will overflow at a certain height.  The problem is that if the user clicks and drags to select multiple items in the list and they want to be able to select items that are not visible but in the overflowed portion of the div, if they drag their mouse down outside of the div, it doesnt automatically scroll to the hidden portions of the div like a normal multiselect element would.  p  pI have no doubt we could handle the mousemove or mouseleave events of the div and scroll it manually but I was wondering if there was a way anyone was aware to do this automatically or what the simplest way to do it is. p  pHere is a jsfiddle showing what doesnt work a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netCAZxk relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netCAZxkap  pIf you click on Item 1 and drag down, once you leave the demo div, I would like the ul to scroll so items 6, 7, etc start to show.p

Regardless, I dont believe this is an inordinate amount of data for todays computers.  p  pThis is part of debugging a larger issue, where Id written a routine that copies an entire datagridview to clipboard, opens a new Excel workbook, and dumps to Excel.  If I run that routine for this particular datagridview, I get a System.OutofMemory exception.p

The webserver works as the middleware between mobile client and database server.li liThe webserver receives the results from the DB queries and passes them to the mobile client.li liMobile client displaysmanipulates the data on the clientside.li ol  pMy experience with APIs are limited to the consumption of Twitter, Instagram, and Google Shopping APIs. From my experience, it seems to be best to transport data between mobile and webserver in JSON format.p  pNow, here are my concerns...p  ol liHow can I ensure that only the loggedin users can use the API Is OAuth the solutionli liFor the REST API, is it better if it is RESTfulli ol  pThe current environment of the website is on shared hosting with PHP and MySQL though Im thinking of moving it to cloudbased services in the future.

Negative 1004 pGday guys. Recently, I decided to try my skills with TCPIP, so at the moment Im trying to write some kind of serverclient chat, using sockets.p  pThe thing I wanted to ask is interaction threads and sockets. Specifically, Im interested in accept function. I tried searching it, but didnt quite find similar situation.p  pSo, the problem is  while Im trying to accept socket outside of the thread, it works perfectly. Contrary, if I use it inside the thread, its call is just ignored.p  pSo, heres the method which calls accept functionp  precodevoid ServerSocketAccept void       sockaddrin saClientAddr     int nCliSize  sizeof sockaddrin      sClient  accept sSocket, sockaddrampsaClientAddr, ampnCliSize       if sClient  INVALIDSOCKET               GetError         return       codepre  pSo, using it in following mannerp  precodeCServerObj.Accept codepre  pit works perfectly, and server waits for the input from the client and then resumes. But, if its used inside the threadp  precodeunsigned stdcall ServerThread void Param       while true               CServerObj.Accept          return 0  codepre  pand than begin the threadp  precodebeginthreadex 0, 0, ampServerThread, 0, 0, NULL  codepre  pthen accept is ignored every time and program goes into the infinite loop telling about the error GetError method.p  pSo, Im kinda confused with this situation. Is this because thread call is asynchronous and therefore it doesnt wait for clients responsep  pAnyway, Id be grateful if someone could explain me what did I do wrong.p  hr  pSo, after some trial amp effort, I figured out the reason behind this strange behavior. It seems like, codeCServerObjcode, which was declared as codestaticcode called constructor twice, therefor rendering codebindcode function useless. Figures, that was stupid error on my part.p  pBut well, now I have another question  why was constructor called twice there Code in the header looked like thisp  precodeifndef BLAHH define BLAHH  class ServerSocket      some code  static ServerSocket CServerObj  endif  BLAHH codepre  pI suppose it could be because variable was declared in the header file... but shouldnt codeifndefcode protect it against second declarationsp

Negative 1004 pOkay so Im familiar with a few techniques for debugging events attached to elements. Events like click, mousedown, focus, etc.p  pThose are easy, but what I am trying to do is log the sequence of events triggered by jquery plugins like sliders, form plugins, etc when the document loads. There is some native markup what gets mutated when the page loads and new elements are introduced and some old ones changed or deleted.p  pNow I tried chrome tools and firefox and setting breakpoints to break on subtree modification on certain elements Im sure are being changed but that only works after the page is finished loading. p  pWhat method would you guys suggest for debugging this kind of situationp  pThere is no code involved, its just an abstract, general situation.p

Negative 1004 pWhat option do I need to use with gcc in order to get rid of errors p
Negative 1004 pemNote Im working with a large complex database, so for claritys sake I have simplified the set up below.emp  pI struggled a bit with how to title the question since its a bit of a complex question. I hope its accurate enough....p  pstrongA bit of background firststrongp  pI have an Access 2010 database that contains a onetomany relationship between a table Called Products and a table called Datasets ie I have a bunch of products, and each product has multiple datasets. Each has an autonumber key field pID and dID respectively as well as numerous other fields.p  pI have a form lets call it frmMain that has two subforms subProducts based on the Products table and subDatasets based on the Datasets table. On the main form I have a control ctrlSelectedProduct which is linked to [subProducts][pID] to see which record in subProducts is selected  has the focus, and the subDatasets subform is linked to this control so that it only displays Datasets records that belong to the selected Products record.p  pOn the main form I also have a number of controls that Im using for filtering the data in the subforms. For example, I have a control ctrlCategory. I have this control coded so that when the user changes the value of the control, a filter is applied that limits the records in subProducts to only those that have a pCategory value equal to whatever is chosen in ctrlCategory. If the control is blank, it will show all records. All this works great when if comes to filtering based on fields in the Products table.p  pstrongNow the problemstrongp  pMy problem is that I also want to be able to filter based on fields in the Datasets table. For example, Datasets has a field called dStatus. I want the user to be able to chose the status in a control ctrlStatus, and based on thisp  pstrong1strong subProducts will be filtered to display only those Products records that have an assotiated Datasets record or records that has dStatus equal to whatever was chosen in ctrlStatusp  pthenp  pstrong2strong when a Products record is selected in this filtered subProducts, subDatasets will only show the Datasets records that has dStatus equal to whatever was chosen in ctrlStatusp  pI know how to do part2. But I have no idea how to get part1 to work. Since subProducts is currently based on the Products table, which does not have the dStatus field, I have no way to filter it based on that field. Thus, Im assuming my first step will be to change my setup so that subProducts is based on a query that combines the two tables or at least adds the dStatus field.p  pIf I do that, however, I get duplicate Product records. I cant use the querys Unique Values property because if I have a product that has two datasets, one with status Current and a one with status Archived, then those arent considered duplicates, and the product info is there twice. If I dont have the status field displayed, it shows only unique products initially, but then I cant subsequently apply a filter based on that nondisplayed field.p  pI also tried basing subProducts on a Totals query in order to utilize the Group By functionality, but I still couldnt get it to work right. Even if I could I dont think thats the best solution, because you can only have 10 fields with Group By, and my Products table has more than 10 fields that I need displayed in subProducts.p  pI feel like Im now just going around in circles and am at a loss of what to try from here. Please help p

Only primitive types or enumeration types are supported in this context. codep  pAlthough LINQ issues like this are easy enough to fix, the real challenge is finding them, given that they do not reveal themselves in the test environment.p  pAm I being unrealistic in expecting that I can mock the behavior of Entity Frameworks implementation  of codeIQueryablecodep  pThanks for your ideas,p  pTim.p

Negative 1004 pstrongThe questionstrong  How can I structure my code so that the knockout bindings are not applied until all of the queries for the ViewModel have been executedp  pstrongUpdatestrong  After some further research and experimentation I think that using something along the lines of a Deferred function may work.

Negative 1004 pAs is typical for grids in a dashboard application that monitors dynamically changing data, my Telerik Kendo UI grid is refreshed with fresh data periodically, every 60 secondsp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodegrid.dataSource.datafreshData grid.refresh   have been informed this refresh may not be necessary codepre  pThe schema does not change, but some new rows might show up in the dataset and some might have been removed.p  pAlthough the codegrid.refreshcode leaves the groupings intact, and the sort state is also preserved, any collapsed groups get expanded. p  pQUESTION How to preserve or restore the expandedcollapsed state of the groups so a user focusing on a particular expanded group with the other groups collapsed is not inconveniencedfrustrated by the periodic updates in which every group gets reexpanded by default p  pEDIT Some Winforms grids provide a way to take a snapshot of the group expandcollapse state before refreshing data, and then to reapply that state after the datasource refresh. strongIf the group header rows in the Kendo UI grid had UIDs that survived a refresh it could be done.strong  But see the suggested approach below that does not involve persistent UIDs.p  pUSE CASE Here is a typical if somewhat dramatic use case for this feature. Center for Disease Control is monitoring realtime outbreaks of a particular strain of flu, by city. Every 15 seconds the dataset is being refreshed. They happen to be focusing at the moment on Los Angeles and have that city expanded, and the other cities collapsed. If every 15 seconds the entire grid expands, it pisses off the doctors at the CDC and they go in and strangle the programmer and then they go home to play golf, and everyone in Los Angeles succumbs. Does Kendo really want to be responsible for that disasterp  pPOSSIBLE FEATURE ENHANCEMENT SUGGESTION Ignore my suggestion about a UID above. Heres a better way. The grid has p  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodeltdiv classkgroupindicator datafieldgroupedByDataFieldNamegt     ... ltdivgt codepre  pNow, if that kgroupindicator div could contain a list of the distinct values of codedatafieldcode with each keys associated data being the expandedcollapsed state of the corresponding section, it would then be possible to save that list to a buffer before making a call to the dataSource.data someNewData method, and then in the eventhandler listening for dataBound event, those expand states could be reapplied. To find the corresponding grouping section for the grouping value, it would be very helpful if the codekgroupingrowcode could have a property called codegroupdatavaluecode which held the grouping value of the particular grouping section, e.g. Sales or Marketing if one were grouping by a datafield called Department.p  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodeltdiv classkgroupindicator datafielddept datatitleDept datadirascgt        ...    ltdiv classkgroupdistinctvaluesgt      ltdiv groupdatavalueSales ariaexpandedfalse gt      ltdiv groupdatavalueEvents Planning ariaexpandedtrue gt    ltdivgt   ltdivgt codepre  pand then in the codekgroupingrowcode  codelttr classkgroupingrow groupdatavalueSalesgtcodep

There werent any errors, but there was a warning, located in the script that causes troublep  pcodeCall webshims.polyfill before DOMReady or set waitReady to false.codep  pSo I took a look into the documentation and set codewaitReadycode to codefalsecode because I load the script at the bottom of the page. As a result, the warning was gone  but IE8 amp IE7 still only display a white page As a test I again removed the call to the script, the page works in IE8 amp 7. As soon as I add the call again  white page.p  pAfter hours of being puzzled, one thing came to my mind As a default, jQuery in Wordpress runs in no conflict mode, meaning instead of writing codesomethingcode you have to write codejQuerysomethingcode. My idea was that this could cause some problems, so I deactivated the no conflict mode. Still Nothing, white page.p  pI dont have any more ideas what could cause the problem, so I am asking you Did you ever encounter that problem Do you have any solutions or ideas for solutionsp  pAny input is really appreciatedp

Negative 1004 pI have a WPF DataGrid that has 10 DataGridTextColumns displaying numeric data that require identical formatting.

Negative 1004 pI have run into a problem with the AJAX response using jquery and coldfusion serverside. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt. When I test the serverside component calling it directly  it always works, so I guess the problem is with the ajax response.

They can contain different additional fields, for example standart product can content no additional fields, but picture can contain fields like author and so on. Really standart product and picture can differ ideologically, not only because of additional fields.p  pThere is table like Order, that should contain link to product and other data. But when I put field like product id, it should be data, is it standart product id, or picture id. p  pThere can be design like table of additional fields, but there will be another problem. I can make tableid, additionalfieldname and table for mapping id, addfieldid, productid, fieldvalue, but fieldvalue can be number and can be string, so this idea is not good I think.p

Negative 1004 pFirst post here Although StackOverflow has been invaluable for years...p  pSo Im working on a Drupal 7 site for a local nonprofit. The goal of the site is, among other things, to allow people to sign up for membership to the organization. These memberships are paid, and vary depending on what the particular service is some will be onetime charges, some recurring. I think I can handle the payment parts with ubercart or something similar, but the problem is figuring out how to allow the main members to add subusers to their accounts. The main members are allowed to add their family members to their account for no extra charge, so a user may have several subusers such as children and spouse.p  pI have tried the Subusers module, but it seems to be buggy, doesnt work as expected, and isnt being maintained or fully ported over to D7. I have researched Organic Groups and that seems to be more suited to large groups of people. There is Relation, but Im just not sure how to implement it along with other modules to get this to work.p  pDoes anybody have any suggestions or hints to point me in the right direction I really want to learn how to do this, because I plan to use Drupal for some other projects after this is complete. Thanksp

Negative 1004 pIve been trying to learn more about generic programming since its something I think I dont know enough about. So Im thinking about how I would implement a template version of one of my programs. The program I am trying to do this with is a numerical integrator program in which the user selects which integrator to use i.e. Euler, Runge Kutta, etc and then integrates whatever function they choose. My current method of doing this is by having an abstract base class called Integrator, and several derived classes that implement the integration method. So the code would look something like this much more going on but this is just to show the methodology. Note that I use Qt for this and I declare an Integrator integrator in the MainWindow class.p  precodevoid MainWindowonintegrateButtonclicked  string whichIntegrator  getUserChoice  integrator  getIntegrator whichIntegrator, whichFunction, order  integratorgtsetUp data   things like initial conditions, time, step size, etc...  runIntegratorInNewThread  codepre  pwith getIntegrator essentially using the factory methodp  precode x being current data, xdot being the results of evaluating derivatives typedef void pFunctionconst double t, const double x[], double xdot  Integrator getIntegrator const string ampwhichIntegrator, pFunction whichFunction, int order        if whichIntegrator  Euler          return new EulerwhichFunction, order      else if whichIntegrator  RungeKutta          return new RungeKuttawhichFunction, order       codepre  pSo this method works fine, and the integrator program runs very well. Now I know that template functions are generated at compile time and given that Im using run time information, how would you implement this using templates If the question is not clear, what Im asking is... Given a user choice at run time, that being which integrator to use, how do I call the correct integration function using a template methodp

No updates to the database will occur outside of the application.p  pMy question is if when defining the caches, setting the eternal attribute to true makes sense. I cant think of any reason that objects should expire from the cache and thus am inclined to set eternal to true. Am I misunderstanding how Ehcache will behavep
Negative 1004 pI couldnt find an answer adequately satisfied my curiosity.p  pSo, why are the add and update commands for codeaptgetcode separated Although I am far from a Linux guru, I dont understand why the Advanced Packaging Tool developers would separate the two commands. It would seem to me that the codeaptgetcode database would only need to be updated after a package source was added, so why not just perform the functionality of aptget update implicitly during a aptget add commandp

We just use the pre defined constants GLKit set up.  The second parameter specifies how many values are present for each vertex. If you look back up at the Vertex struct, youll see that for the position there are three floats x,y,z and for the color there are four floats r,g,b,a.  The third parameter specifies the type of each value  which is float for both Posi tion and Color.  The fourth parameter is always set to false.  The fifth parameter is the size of the stride, which is a fancy way of saying the size of the data structure containing the pervertex data. So we can simply pass in sizeofVertex here to get the compiler to compute it for us.  The final parameter is the offset within the structure to find this data. We can use the handy offsetof operator to find the offset of a particular field within a structure. codepre  pMy glkView looks like thisp  precode voidglkViewGLKView view drawInRectCGRectrect      glClearColor0.65f, 0.65f, 0.65f, 1.0f     glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT       Render the object with GLKit     [self.effect prepareToDraw]      glBindVertexArrayOESvertexArray      glDrawElementsGLTRIANGLES, sizeofBallindexsizeofBallindex[0], GLUNSIGNEDSHORT, 0   codepre  pCan someone shed some light on what I am doing wrong Thanksp

Thanks in advancep  pI cant even say I am doing any of this right, so feel free to chastise me.p  pHTMLp  precodeltbody onloadgetLaneWeightgt ltform idWarehouseWorksheet nameWarehouseWorksheetgt lttable aligncentergt         lttbodygt             lttrgt                 ltthgt                     Lane Types                 ltthgt                 ltthgt                     Total Weight                 ltthgt             lttrgt             lttrgt                 lttdgt                     Lead 1                 lttdgt                 lttdgt                     ltinput typetext nameLead1 readonlyreadonly gt                 lttdgt             lttrgt             lttrgt                 lttdgt                     Lead 2                 lttdgt                 lttdgt                     ltinput typetext nameLead2 readonlyreadonly gt                 lttdgt             lttrgt             lttrgt                 lttdgt                     Poly 1                 lttdgt                 lttdgt                     ltinput typetext namePoly1 readonlyreadonly gt                 lttdgt             lttrgt             lttrgt                 lttdgt                     Poly 2                 lttdgt                 lttdgt                     ltinput typetext namePoly2 readonlyreadonly gt                 lttdgt             lttrgt             lttrgt                 lttdgt                     Poly 3                 lttdgt                 lttdgt                     ltinput typetext namePoly3 readonlyreadonly gt                 lttdgt             lttrgt         lttbodygt         lttablegt   ltformgt   ltbodygt codepre  pJS FILEp  precodePopulate Lane Type Weight Table function getLaneWeight  .ajax     type GET,     url .phpgetLaneWeight.php,     data lanenameLead1,     success function mydata          document.forms[WarehouseWorksheet].elements[Lead1].value  mydata     ,     error function        ,     complete function           getLead2Call next Lane Type        Set Next Lane Weight function getLead2  .ajax     type GET,     url .phpgetLaneWeight.php,     data lanenameLead2,     success function mydata          document.forms[WarehouseWorksheet].elements[Lead2].value  mydata         alertdocument.forms[WarehouseWorksheet].elements[Lead1].value     ,     error function        ,     complete function           getPoly1Call next Lane Type        codepre  pPHPSQLp  precodeifisset GET[Poly2]     sqlSELECT SUMweight         FROM bundlelanes         WHERE lanename  Poly3 else ifisset GET[Poly1]     sqlSELECT SUMweight         FROM bundlelanes         WHERE lanename  Poly2 else ifisset GET[Lead2]     sqlSELECT SUMweight         FROM bundlelanes         WHERE lanename  Poly1 else ifisset GET[Lead1]     sqlSELECT SUMweight         FROM bundlelanes         WHERE lanename  Lead2 else      sqlSELECT SUMweight         FROM bundlelanes         WHERE lanename  Lead1   result  mysqlquerysql or die Error.mysqlerror  while data  mysqlfetchrowresult      weight  data[0]     echo weight  codepre

Negative 1004 pI am using entity framework to persist data in a Ntier Wpf application. My dbcontext is shared amongst all repositories and is never disposed.

If an error accurs while persisting the object the object is still markted as modifed and if the user aborts the current opperation he will get the same error when saving another object.p  pI have solved this by overriding SaveChanges in my dbcontext and if any error accurs I accept all changessee code below. So if an error accurs the object and all objects are marked unchanged even if theyre not persited.p  pThis doesnt feel right...

Negative 1004 pI have an embedded C project which uses subversion for source control. I want to use a hrefhttpwww.hitex.comindex.phpidmoduleunittest relnofollowTessya for unit testing and have these tests archived in subversion too. However, it generates many small files which will make analysing diffs for the actual source code changes a real pain.

Negative 1004 pI am working on an app that is more like a photogallery, where user have high res images and will be zooming and inspecting every aspect of the image. I dont have a technical question but rather asking for advice about this issuep  pall images are formatted in 640 X 960 format, which works fine for retina device, except for iPhone 5. which is 640 x 1156. I can have the imageview expand but that would stretch the image and make it look elongated. If anyone has come across this issue, what did they do I would rather not add any extra controls to compensate for the extra space If I decide to stick with 640 X 960 on the iPhone 5  theres about 88 pixels of height to work with .p  pThanks.p

Negative 1004 pIn my project Im using Angular UIs uirouter for nested views. My layout on a particular record page looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCSFhw.jpg altenter image description herep  pOn first load everything works great, the validation works, the form saves changes to the model etc. The problem arises when you make changes to the form leaving it in an invalid state, then browse to another sub nav link, and then go back again. At this point the previous loaded form had changed the model inherited from the parent view making it invalid, but the new form has loaded with that model believing all its fields to be pristine, and so the form is now in a valid state allowing the user to bypass clientside validation. I cant seem to make the form wake up and validate automatically again unless the user edits a field.p  pOne way I can fix this is to load the model in the nested views controller, so when you click back to the form again from sub nav it loads a fresh model, but I dont feel that this is the right solution especially since on first load both the parent and sub view will both perform a GET for the model.p  pIm a little stuck on this one, any help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 1004 pI recently asked a question on how to insert an item into an array based on the objects percentage as shown a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18264524rubyinsertintoanarraybasedonapercentage18264568noredirect1comment2678790018264568herea.

Negative 1004 pI have confusion on what I need to do here. I am new to Mongo. I have set up a small Mongo server on Amazon EC2, with EBS volumes, one for data, one for logs. I need to do a backup. Its okay to take the DB down in the middle of the night, at least currently.p  pUsing the boto library, EBS snapshots and python to do the backup, I built a simple script that does the followingp  psudo service mongodb stop run backup of data run backup of logs sudo service mongodb startp  pThe script ran through and restarted, but I noted in the AWS console that the snapshots are still being created, even through boto has come back, but Mongo has restarted. Certainly not ideal.p  pI checked the Mongo docs, and found this explanation on what to do for backupsp  pa hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgecosystemtutorialbackupandrestoremongodbonamazonec2ec2backupdatabasefiles relnofollowhttpdocs.mongodb.orgecosystemtutorialbackupandrestoremongodbonamazonec2ec2backupdatabasefilesap  pThis is good info, but a bit unclear. If you are using journaling, which we are, it saysp  pstrongIf the dbpath is mapped to a single EBS volume then proceed to Backup the Database Files.strongp  pWe have a single volume for data. So, Im assuming that means to bypass the steps on flushing and locking. But at the end of strongBackup the Database Filesstrong, it discusses removing the locks.p  pSo, Im a bit confused. As I read it originally, then I dont actually need to do anything  I can just run the backup, and not worry about flushinglocking period. I probably dont need to take the DB down. But the paranoid part of me says no, that sounds suspicious.p  pAny thoughts from anyone on this, or experience, or good old fashioned knowledgep

Negative 1004 pI have a form that contains two elements a codeCheckedListBoxcode and a codeCheckBoxcode. The codeCheckBoxcode, which is called codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode, is used to checkuncheck all items in the codeCheckedListBoxcode. I achieve this via a codeCheckedChangedcode event handler associated with the codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode, so that when it is checked, all items in the codeCheckedListBoxcode are checked, and vice versa. This works fine.p  pI also have code that unchecks the codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode when the user unchecks one of the CheckBoxes in the codeCheckedListBoxcode. For example, if the user checks the codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode, and then unchecks one of the items, the Select All codeCheckBoxcode should be unchecked. This is achieved via the codeCheckedListBox.ItemCheckedcode event handler. This also works fine.p  pMy problem is that when the codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode is programatically unchecked as in the above scenario, its event handler causes all items in the codeCheckedListBoxcode to become unchecked.p  pIm sure others have run into my issue is there an elegant workaroundp

Negative 1004 pI am working on the Linux Kernel as part of my course homework and this is the information I seekp  pIn the latest systems, memory is split up into ranks under which which memory is interleaved among the different ranks in a noncontiguous way.

Negative 1004 pLet me start by clarifying what this question is NOT.  Its not a request for an simple explanation of how Flash memory management or garbage collection works reference counting, mark and sweep, etc..  Nor is it a request for tips for avoiding memory leaks like recycling renders, weak references, removing event listener, IDispose pattern, stopping timers, avoiding static pointers and pointers from global object like stage, etc.p  pAssume you have a reasonably large Flex program coded in MXML and Actionscript, and assume that it is coded by persons who are reasonably conversant in all of the above, and assume it STILL has a memory leak.  At this point it is necessary to debug the problem, and the question is how to do it.p  pThe Flash Builder Premium IDE can take a memory snapshot at time A and time B, and then compare the two snapshots, and then report on loitering objects.  To use this, a program is run to a steady state time A, then it is run some more time B, and the implicit assumption is that the system should contain approximately the same objects  if it doesnt then the new ones are loitering the memory leak.  Conveniently, the IDE will provide a list of pointers leading to each loitering object.p  pBut the IDE doesnt appear to provide the critically important information which of those pointers are locking an object in memory and preventing garbage collection, vs. which are merely pointers from child objects cycles that should go away naturally if the object is collected.  While the IDE does flag some pointers as gcroot, anecdotally pointers from child objects are often usually flagged as gcroot so this flag doesnt provide the necessary information.  Since a reasonably sized program can have a LOT of objects, and since they can be connected in a complex graph via pointers, it is difficult to use the IDE to find which pointers are causing memory leaks.p  pThus, my question is, does anyone have any tips beyond what is already mentioned above on how to find the cause of memory leaks in a Flex program implemented in Actionscript and MXMLp

Negative 1004 pI have two ASP.NET MVC 4 projects created in VS2012. For each, I created an Azure deployment project and they are both deployed successfully to Azure. I got a new dev machine and started fresh with only VS2013 installed, hoping that, as advertised, I wouldnt have to go through the pain of migrations that would make the projects tied to this version. Well, that didnt turn out true, as Azure projects must be upgraded to v2.2 of the Azure .NET tools and API to be opened in VS2013. p  pOn the first project, I installed the 2.2 tools and with a few other relatively minor adjustments, the project works fine. Now, on the second project, however, I can find no way to  perform the upgrade. When I opened the project in VS2013, it gave me a migration report saying that the Azure project was incompatible and the only solution offered was to install the 2.2 tools, which of course, has already been installed. I then decided to remove the existing azure deployment project and create a new one as I did before on vs2012, by rightclicking on the web project and choosing Add Azure deployment project, which wires everything up automatically. Well, that menu item does not appear in the context menu on the web project.p  pNow, Im at a loss for how to resolve this, other than installing VS2012 and forego taking advantage of the advances in VS2013. Does anyone have any suggestions how i can get an Azure deployment project working with this project p  pBTW, this is a must, because I am using the azure api to get config items out of the azure config.p

Negative 1004 pstrongoriginal questionstrong  p  pI have a standard texttospeech, android.speech.tts.TextToSpeechp  pI initialize it and set a language by using codetts.setLanguageLocale.getDefaultcodep  pThat default Locale is deDE for germany, correct. Right after setting it, i ask the tts to give me its language codetts.getLanguagecodep  pnow it tells me that its set to deuDEUp  pThere is no Locale with that setting. So i cant even check if its set to the right language because i cant find the Locale object that has the matching values.p  pIssue might be related to Android 4.3, but i didnt find any info.p  pBackground is, that i need to show values with the same decimal symbol, but tts needs the correct symbol or it says dot in german which makes NO sense at all.p  pstrongConclusionstrong  p  pA Locale is a container that contains a string that is composed of a language, a country and an optional string. Every texttospeech engine can return a custom Locale like engUSAtexas.p  pFurthermore the Locale that is returned by the tts engine can only be a close match to the wanted Locale. So enUS instead of enUK.p  pHowever, Locale has a method called codegetLanguagecode and it returns the first part of above mentioned string. en or eng. Those Language codes are regulated by ISO and one can hope that everyone sticks to it. see link in the accepted answer  p  pSo checking for codetts.getLanguage.getLanguage.startsWithencode should always be true if its some form of english language setting and the ISO standards are fulfilled.p  pIt is important to mention that Locales should not be compared by codelocalea  localebcode as both can be different objects yet have the same content, they are containers of sort.br Always compare with codelocalea.equalslocalebcodep  pI hope this helps people sort out some problems with tts and languagep

Negative 1004 pits the first time Im seriously using autolayout so Im sure Im missing something obvious.p  pI have a very simple view embedded in a UINavigationController. There are three subviews a UIWebView, a UIToolbar which in turn contains three UIBarButtons and a UIActivityIndicatorView. Its just a basic browser view, basically.p  pI managed to have everything appear as it should even on rotation, except for the toolbar if the view is first loaded in vertical orientation, going landscape will not resize the toolbar from 44 to 32 points. Originally, before I wiped everything out, it did resize the toolbar BUT the builtin UIBarButtonItems appeared lower and cut off, as if the toolbar was still 44 points tall but pushed 16 points out of the screen. If the view is first loaded horizonttaly, the bar is 32 points high but the builtin UIBarButtonItems appear still like that, and rotating to vertical will keep it at 32 points.p  pimg srchttpi61.tinypic.comw0j9g9.png altexamplep  pI honestly have no idea how to make this work as expected ie. resize properly when rotated, with the buttons showing properly, so if anyone could point me in the right direction  pun intended  I would be really grateful.p  pThe activity indicator is right in the middle of the frame, with these constraintsp  ul liAlign Center X to Superviewli liAlign Center Y to Superviewli ul  pThe web view is set to use all available space from the top of the view including the navbar up to the top of the toolbar, and has these contraintsp  ul liTop Space to Superviewli liBottom Space to Toolbarli liAlign Trailing to Toolbarli liBottom Space to Toolbar its actually listed twiceli liAlign Leading to Toolbarli ul  pThe toolbar is a mess. It hasp  ul liBottom space to Superviewli liAlign Center X to Superviewli liTop Space to Web Viewli liAlign Trailing to Web Viewli liTop Space to Web View listed twiceli liLeading Space to Superviewli liAlign Leading to Web Viewli liBottom Space to Bottom Layout Guideli ul  pThe problem is that by not adding any constraints at all, the web view is much bigger than it should be, and the toolbar doesnt even show. I mostly set these constraints using the horizontal and vertical red bars similar to springs and strouts in the pin popover for autolayout, but Im starting to think thats not the most appropriate approach.p  pNote that Im not trying to use autolayout emwithinem the toolbar, I read that it wouldnt work and Im just using the builtin buttons plus a couple of labelled ones those arrows are really unicode characters, I may change them to prettier images at some point.p  pThank you in advance. p

Negative 1004 pIm learning myself some D and wanted to implement a set of templates that safely handles physical values i.e. values with units. The final goal would be to be able to do something like thisp  precodeint mainstring[] argv     auto m1  meterfloat1.0     auto m2  meterdouble2.0      m3 should be meterdouble with value 3     auto m3  m1  m2      auto f1  feetfloat1.0     auto f2  feetint2      where f3 should be of type feetfloat with value 3     auto f3  f1  f2       and finally, where m4 should be meterdouble      with value 1.33 i.e. correctly converted addition of the feet value     auto m4  m1  f1  codepre  phowever, at the moment I cant even get the additon operator for a simple meterfloat  meterfloat to work. It interestingly fails the same way with meterdouble and even in a modified version with a simple float. This indicates to me, that Im either missing something fundamental or trying to do something that is impossible to do trivially. I looked at  github.comPhilippeSigaudDtemplatestutorial, Dlang.org and www.ddili.orgdersd.en and google for 2h now, but couldnt find any solution.p  pHere are my templates please note that I left out the isNumeric assertions and similar for the sake of readabilityp  precodeclass LengthValueT     ValueT value    string name    string symbol     thisValueT value, string name, string symbol             this.value  value         this.value  name         this.symbol  symbol       class meterValueTLengthValueT      thisValueT value         supervalue, meter, m            Try 1      the first try for overloading the op     ref opBinarystring op, otherValueT in meterotherValueT rhs     if op    op    op    op    op                mixinalias typeofthis.value  op  rhs.value ReturnT               return meterReturnTthis.value  op  rhs.value               output      Error no property opCall for type units.meterfloat.meter      Error template instance units.meterfloat.meter.opBinary, float             error instantiating       Try 2      I also tried this     ref opBinarystring op, RhsmeterotherValueT in Rhs rhs     if op    op    op    op    op                mixinalias typeofthis.value  op  rhs.value ReturnT               return meterReturnTthis.value  op  rhs.value               output     Error undefined identifier otherValueT, obviously       Try3      and finally this, to see if using a templated something on the right hand side      was causing the problem, passing just a float ie auto m3  m1  1.0     ref opBinarystring op, otherValueT in otherValueT rhs     if op    op    op    op    op                mixinalias typeofthis.value  op  rhs ReturnT               return meterReturnTthis.value  op  rhs               output      Error no property opCall for type units.meterfloat.meter      Error template instance units.meterfloat.meter.opBinary, float             error instantiating  codepre  pSo my questions arep  ol liIs something like my imagined endgoal accomplishable with Ds templatesli liIf so, how could it be doneli liIs template specialisation the way to go for the meters and feet part of the problemli liHow do I specify that my operator expects an instantiation of the samea specific template, but wit probably different instation arguementsli liIs it possible to overload the operator to achive polymorphistic behaviour that is yet typesafe and predictableli ol  pAs I said, Im new to D and relatively new to templates in general. So any kind of illuminating answer or reading hint would be appreciated. If you need clarification on details, post a comment and Ill try my best.p  pThank youp

The communication with server will be done using HTTPS. li ul  pIf authentication is successfulp  ul liusername is stored in Key Chain.li lipPassphraseUDID is hashed using PBKDF2 available in OpenSSL Library. This is also stored in Key Chain. The salt for this operation is stored in the Key Chain. For subsequent validations salt is obtained from the Key Chain.pli lipUsernamePassphraseUDIDStaticKey is used to generate a key using PBKDF2 and again salt is stored in the Key Chain and retrieved from Key Chain from subsequent uses. The generated key is stored inmemory and passphrase is forgotten after key has been generated. The StaticKey is present in the code.pli lipWhen the app goes to background, the Key is forgotten i.e. the variable is set to nil. pli lipUpon resuming or relaunching the app, the user is presented a screen to enter the passphrase. If the passphrase entered is correct the app will generate the key again. Otherwise on around five consecutive attempts the app will wipe the data and take the user back to login screenif possible also send a message to server regarding the event with necessary information.pli ul  pNow here are my two questionp  ul lipI would like to know that how stable is a hrefhttpsgithub.comprojectimasencryptedcoredata relnofollowprojectimaxEncryptedCoreDataa I know they do not support manytomany relations.

I have a very simple code that exports the contents of some tables into an excel workbook and then I want to save the workbook in the same directory as the database.  My code works just fine on my computer, but when I try to load the database on a colleagues, the tables export just fine, but the excel workbook will not save as the given nameit just gives a prompt and asks whether you want to save Book1.xlsx  If I disable the messages, it just doesnt save it at all.  His curDir is different than mine, but I checked and the workbooks arent in there either The database was created in Access 2013 and both computers have Access 2013 installed, although the second one the one thats not working also has Access and Excel 2010 installed.

Negative 1004 pI have been trying to get some data from my dotnet webservice and pass the results in json format to my android application.

Negative 1004 pOn my Apache webserver i can server PDF files directly in the Browser with a simple Anchor link likep  precodelta hrefmyfoldermysample.pdfgtClick to display PDFltagt codepre  pThis Works fine.p  pNow, ive got a lot of PDFs i want to Protect. So i moved them all outside the Web folder, and are serving them through a PHP download program  i called it download.phpp  pTo be sure that the pdf files are not downloaded as download.php i have to set the ContentDisposition Header to inlinefilenamemysample.pdf. Inline because i want to open it in the Browser.p  pNo Problem, all works fine. the files are downloading fine on Windows and Apple Browsers and are displayed IN the Browser, just like when its served directly from the Apache Server.p  pBut my download.php doesnt work with Android Browsers... Its always just downloaded but not opened in the browser. You have to find the file in your messages and open it separately. When served directly from Apache it IS opened in the Browser.p  pIt seems to be connected with ContentDisposition Header im setting in my download.php, because this is the only difference i see in the headers when download direct and indirect.p  pAnybody had the same problemp  pThanks Perp

And then, I convert the float back to an integer, something interesting happens. The new codeintegercode becomes the minimum integer code2147483648code.br The source codes look as belowp  precodeint a  INTMAX float b  a  b is correct int anew  b  anew becomes INTMIN codepre  pI am not sure what happens when the float number codebcode is converted to the integer codeanewcode. So, is there any reasonable solution to find the maximum value which can be switched forth and back between codeintegercode and codefloatcode typep  pPS The value of codeINTMAXcode  100 works fine, but this is just an arbitrary workaround. p
Negative 1004 pIn my codeSpriteKitcode project, I am learning to use the wonderful, built in physics engine. I am accomplishing this through the use of codeSKPhysicsBodycode instances attached to nodes, and it has worked out well so far. My current set up is when I add a node, I set its codephysicsBodycodes codevelocitycode vector to some constant velocity. Despite manually setting the velocity to some fixed value, after a few seconds of nodes colliding, strongtheir velocity decreasesstrong. I assume this is the default characteristic as it simulates real life physics loss of energy through multiple collisions. strongI would like to stop this behaviorstrong. For example, I would like, despite numerous collisions, all energy to be perfectly preserved and no velocity lost. Here are a few things I have tried to no avail.p  ol licodephysicsBody.linearDamping  0codeli licodephysicsBody.friction       0codeli ol  pIs this even a codephysicsBodycode property, or does this behaviour stem from a property on the codeSKScenecodes codephysicsWorldcode propertyp

Negative 1004 pThe new CloudSearch API uses Solr in the backend and Solr has the Did You Mean feature.

Negative 1004 pI have a container UIView that has constraints that will cause it to change height to match either an old 3.5 iPhone or a new 4 iPhone. Inside that container UIView, I have several copies of a custom UIView, lets call it codeDynamicButtoncode. codeDynamicButtoncode has three subviews which are laid out using their frames no constraints and whenever code[DynamicButton setFrame]code is called, the frames of the three subviews are recomputedp  pMy constraints are set up so that my codeDynamicButtoncode views will fill the entire container view with equal heights.p  pIn codeviewDidLoadcode and codeviewWillAppearcode the height of my containerView is the height it is in the storyboard regardless of the device. My codeDynamicButtoncodes are code58code pixels tall. p  pIn codeviewDidAppearcode, the constraints have finally taken effect and the containerView height gets reduced to the right value when being displayed on an old 3.5 iPhone, and my codeDynamicButtoncodes are code47code pixels tall. p  pHowever, my codeDynamicButtoncode class never receives a codesetFramecode message when it changes size.p  pWhat method do I need to override to intercept that size change so I can reconfigure the frames on my subviewsp

Negative 1004 pThis question is more like open discussion. I would like to start with an example. Suppose there is one service FooService p  precodepublic interface IFooService  void Method1 public class FooService IFooService  void Method1 ...  codepre  pIn order to test the service , we write the unit test code like below, no external servicesp  precodepublic void TestMethod1 ...  codepre  pThen suppose in Method1 we need to use another class called AService which inherit from IAServicep  precodepublic interface IAService void AMethod1 public class AService  IAService  void AMethod1  public class FooService  IFooService       private IAService a     public FooService IAService a this.a  a     void Method1 a.AMethod1 ..... business logic .....   codepre  pThen we have to refactor the unit test to mock AServicep  precodepublic void TestMethod1      IMockAService aService  MockRepository.StrickMockltIAServicegt      .....  codepre  pSo when need more external services, we have to add mock service, if some of services changed the logic or add or remove parameters, and so on. If there are 100 test cases, we have to modify all of test cases.p  pSo whats the best solution for mocking increasing external services and effective way to handle any changes of external dependencies for example  addremove parameters of methods.p  pthanksp
Negative 1004 pI am used to unused methods giving hints and having no blue dot in the gutter. But that is not happening. I have just moved a large number of methods from a form unit to another, expecting the hints to find them so I could avoid the danger of cutting them out then finding I would need them.p  pBut I have no hints, and the unused methods have blue dots. This is probable bound to be because of the new introspection. Which I dont like.p

Negative 1004 pWhen developing my apps I usually create a category on UIColor and a custom color palette CLR file for Interface Builder for my specific colors.

On OS X I believe I could achieve this with the codeNSColorListcode class. Since codeNSColorListcode doesnt exist for iOS I believe my only option is to build my own ColorList class that can create and return codeUIColorcodes from a CLR file.p  pIs the CLR file format documented somewhere Am I missing some other way to keep my colors in 1 place and access them from both IB and codep  pApple Docsp  ul lia hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaReferenceApplicationKitClassesNSColorListClassReferenceReference.htmlapplerefoccinstmNSColorListinitWithName3afromFile3a relnofollowNSColorList Classali lia hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualDrawColorConceptsAboutColorLists.html relnofollowColor Programming Guideali ul

Id like to match its height but not working codepre  pSome things arent working correctly. Firstly, the track bar emdoesnt even appearem until I either maximize the window or resize the window repeatedly and randomly. Once its displayed it remains there regardless of the window state.p  pThere are already three items in the status strip before track bar added. The first item is autosized label that springs to the second and third fixed width labels so the smaller fixedwidth labels always stay on the right for x and y coords.p  pThe trackbar created is gigantic. Changing the height of the control host or the trackbar itself isnt changing the trackbar height. Its making the entire status strip huge.p  pId even settle for adding a button that spawns a temporary vertical trackbar if that would be easier.p  pCalling Invalidate on mainStatus does not help.p

Negative 1004 pI have a specific question concerning the event bus design pattern in combination with androids activitiesfragmentsservices.p  pWhat I understood so far When using an event bus I create, lets say, a single event bus for my whole application singleton design pattern. Now I can make single activitiesfragmentsservices post an event on the event bus and the event bus spreads the news to all other activitiesfragmentsservices which subscribed to this specific event. This way all other activitiesfragmentsservices can react to this specific event. In order for all activitiesfragmentsservices to be able to use the event bus they have to register with the bus prefereably in their onCreatemethods and they should unregister if they are about to be stoppedcanceleddestroyed.p  pThis brings me to my question Lets say I want to implement a brand new actionbar NOT the android one or sherlock or any other, I mean from scratch here. As far as my understanding goes I could implement an actionbar with an event bus. So I would have my main activity with buttons on top of the activitylayout and each button has its own onClickmethod implemented. For each button I would have a fragment that becomes visible once the associated button is clicked. Now within each onClickmethod one for each button I could post an event to the event bus and the bus spreads it to the fragments. The fragments then check whether they should go visible or not depending on the additional event information.p  pNow the problem here is, each fragment would need to register with the event bus first, so in order for this to work each fragments onCreatemethod must be called at least once, is that rightp  pThank you for any insights into thisp  pSteffenp

Negative 1004 pI dont seem to be able to find a way to escape this hyphenated database name so that I can open a connection to it.

Ive tried enclosing it in square brackets, curly brackets, parentheses, backticks, single quotes, double quotes, etc.  Ive tried backslash and exclamation points.  I cant find a way to escape the database name so that I can connect to it.  p  pThe error message I get isbr codeRuntime error 2147467259 80004005  [Microsoft][ODBS SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Cannot open database [EDMSLok] requested by the login.  The login failed.codep  pThe database name and credentials are correct. I can access it if I omit the database name argument from the connection string, and then use the fully qualified name in my SQL statements i.e. codeSELECT  FROM [EDMSLok].dbo.tablenamecodep  pHowever, I really dont want to do this, as Im trying to use modular code that does the same actions on multiple databases. What I want is to open the connection to one database, run some SQL procedures, close the connection, then open a connection to another database and run the same SQL procedures.  Lather, rinse, repeat. p  pAlso, before someone asks, I do not have the option of changing the database name.  p  pAs a test, I used the exact same connection string to connect to another database on the server that did not have a hyphenated name and it worked without error, so Im pretty sure its the stupid hyphenated name that is the problem. p

Negative 1004 pWe are developing an internal website which has documents uploaded to it and when a user clicks on the link to the file in IE it has a login window pop up asking for a user name and password.  It does not do this in chrome or firefox.  It also does not do this with PDF files, only with Word or Excel files.  Our goal is to upload these documents without having a user having to enter credentials or deal with pop ups.  The few files we are having this issue with cannot be converted to PDF files due to functions in the documents.p  pThanks in advance for any help or suggestions.p

Negative 1004 pIm writing an application using MMAL. Much of how the hardware camera module was set up was derived from a hrefhttpsgithub.comraspberrypiuserlandblobmasterhostapplicationslinuxappsraspicamRaspiVid.c relnofollowherea. The purpose of the application is to overlay a texture onto the video stream and onto a file using the H.264 video file format.p  pIt would be ideal if I would be able to receive a callback of sorts with a buffer of raw RGBA data, manipulate it overlay the raw texture, and send it off to the encoder.p  pConceptually, I have a camera and encoder component. The camera component has a video output port, while the encoder component has both an input and output port. The video output port is connected to the encoder input port. In the encoder output port, a callback is registered and at each callback, the buffer data is appended to a file stream.p  pI attempted to register a callback on the video port, but a simple codeprintfcode inside the video output port yields no output.p  pIs this possible If so, what exactly am I missingp  pEdit I have added the splitter component and have made the following connections strongVideoOutputPort  Splitter  H.264Encoderstrong with no luck.p  pEdit Im looking into using stronglibavcodecstrongp

Negative 1004 pIs it possible to draw a border on a face with an arbitrary amount of triangles via a shader I managed to draw a very unclean line by passing an additional float3 for every border point, interpolating, and building the polygons in a way that only the borderlines have the same value for successive border vertices. Then I checked if any of the values is greater than x 0.9 and if so, painted the border. This gives a pretty unclean result and forces me to make rather ugly polygons where the first vertex is part of every polygon in the face. Is there a general solution to this  Btw. the faces have NO inner vertices. They will have inner edges though which must not be treated as borders.p

Negative 1004 pIm trying to design and implement a system, building on the ability to extend functionality of the Windows NPS service, when authenticating for a VPN service, through use of an extension DLL. The extension DLL, written in C, posts some information about the authentication attempt to a REST based servlet. This servlet is responsible for sending a code through email to the email address of the person authenticating. The user will have to authenticate himself through entering this code in an Android application, which sends this code back to the servlet for checking. If the code received from the user corrosponds the code sent previously in the process, the servlet will respond to the DLLs HTTPClient with a status code signaling the successful authentication process. p  pIm struggling to find a proper solution for handling the authentication code checking. I want to handle the request from the DLL, send the email, and wait for the user to send the authentication code back through the Android application. My first thought was make use of the Spring MVC framework, and utilize Asynchronous Request Processing a hrefhttpsspring.ioblog20120514springmvc32previewaddinglongpollingtoanexistingwebapplication relnofollowhttpsspring.ioblog20120514springmvc32previewaddinglongpollingtoanexistingwebapplicationa. However, I do not have a proper solution yet. p  pMy idea was to have two separate method, one mapped to handle to request from the DLL, the other to handle the request from Android application. The method mapped to handle the request from the DLL should sleep until interrupted by the method mapped to handle the request from the Android application and check if the authentication code matches. p  pThis idea sounds good to me, but I cannot find any pointers as how to implement this idea. Also an issue what dawned on me is that there might be multiple threads, waiting for an interrupt. How do I handle that the correct Android mapped method interrupts the matching DLL mapped methodp  pCould anyone give me some pointers where to look, or adjust my train of thought to a better way to handle this problemp  pThanks.p
Negative 1004 pI need to implement a simple tracking system. Basically when an image is viewed, I want to increment a counter. What database system is suitable for this Of course any database can do this. But I imagine at high loads, some database systems will be more suitable for it. p  pSince I have access to Amazon Web Services SimpleDBDynamoDB maybe used. Otherwise, might MongoDB or something supported by heroku suitable p  pWhat I might end up doing is increment in memory then periodically write to DB then any database can be used.

Negative 1004 pI am developing a number of separate applications that can work together. While they may start out hosted on the same server, they can if required and most probably will be moved to separate servers. Each application will have its own database, and while applications may be able to query each others databases directly, the overall structure will use OOP principles, so if a method already exists in one application to make a specific database query or perform some function, there should be no need to duplicate that method in another application that needs to make the same query or function. In such cases applications will need to be able to communicate with each other, and send queries and data back and forth efficiently and securely.p  pFor example, one application needs to determine if a user is logged in, what their role is and get some additional info about that user by querying a separate user application. Then if the user is logged in, it needs to send a request to a 3rd application to get the assets for that user.p  pWhile the applications will mostly be programmed in PHP, some applications may be programmed using a different language such as, Java for example. Each application may or may not be accessible through a sub domain via APIs. Each application server may or may not be on the same private network  this will largely depend on the requirements for the method used to enable apps to communicate with each other. Im still deciding whats best for these factors.p  pThe apps will be used through fairly simple, lightweight front ends using API requests. A front end could be a web site, a mobile app, etc. A front end may be able to access all apps or just one or more apps. The API calls from a front end will ideally be made to each app via a router, which will likely be built in to a front end. I.e. so all API calls are made locally through one domain and the apps them selves remain domain agnostic, and so will likely not receive HTTP requests at all. Thus, the router will need to communicate with the apps using the same behind the scenes method the apps use to communicate with each other.p  pThe kind of data expected to be transferred between apps would mostly be strings, integers, text and bullions which could be passed as integers. There would be a high volume of data being exchanged between apps, but the data will mostly be quite small such as an array of user profile data for example, that may include account information, profile, bio etc.p  pIt may help if I give a little more info as to why I am trying to do this and what I am trying to achieve. Basically I am building a vary large webmobile application that can logically be split into separate sub applications or modules. While all of the applications will be part of the main web site and appear to the end user as one large application, some applications will work well on their own as well, on separate web sites, perhaps with separate or combined user systems.p  pThe whole system will have to cope with high volumes of traffic and be expandable. So it makes sense to build each app as a separate, self contained module with its own database. Each module can be independently moved to another server when required and its database can be further moved to its own server or sharded etc. Each module can easily be developed, tested, rolled out, disabled, enabled etc without affecting the overall application. p  pAlso any number of front ends of any type, can easily be built to work with all the apps or just specific ones, and public APIs can easily be made available for other sites to hook into the system. Im developing this app on my own and Id like to get the basic modules launched ASAP and develop more and add more as I go. It makes perfect sense to me to split the apps up in this way in terms of making it most flexible and easy to manage, both for me as a sole dev and eventually for a teem of devs when hopefully it gets that farp  pSo what is the best method in terms of being efficient, fast, light on resources and secure, for these applications to communicate with each other behind the scenes Is it best to use SSH and JSON for this Or is there something better If using SSH how would you pass the resulting data back to the requesting application They do not need to communicate via HTTP, and doing so, I think, would be completely wrong and inefficient.p  pIn summary, what I am asking, is what protocols should I consider using to pass requests and data from server to server with out using HTTP, that will be efficient, secure, fast, language agnostic but mostly PHP etcp

Negative 1004 pIm a junior developer working with a fairly large ASP website with 100 web forms and 100 user controls. Our job is to converting the project to MVC5. The whole MVC conceptpattern is very interesting and right now Im contemplating on how to make the transition as smooth as possible according to best practice whatever it might be.p  pThis website is a customer portal oriented toward telephony which is heavily data driven. We fetch all data through a WCF proxy and the proxy usually returns a List of type T. For each list, we create a corresponding View Model. The View Model is populated with data and sent to the View. So far so good.p  pHowever, before the data is actually displayed, there is usually some kind of display logic for lack of a better term. For example, lets assume we get back a List from the WCF proxy. PhoneLogs has certain properties, such asp  ul liunit price  li liseason  li licustomer name li liinvoiceli liidli ul  petc. p  pFor the PhoneLogs that belongs to customer with the 1, we want to run a Linq query that summarizes the season price according to a unit price or whatever  just to illustrate a example. p  pI should add that some forms can be really complicated with lot of things going on one form might working with 67 different type of Lists that might have complex properties, such as List of , methods which ask for data from the proxy, methods that to some kind of formatting logic before displaying it in a GridView, logic when a customer has clicked on a radio button, link, button or whatever, etc. And all this stuff is on the same user control. Just reading through the code can be really confusing. And converting all this stuff to MVC in a proper way is challenging.p  pWith a large project like this, I really want to work according to some structure or pattern My question is, where should I put in all the display logic Should I put it directly in the controller as a helper methods Or should the logic be part of the View Model Or other separate files andor directories Any suggestionidea is highly appreciatedp

However, for the likert scale columns, Im concerned that there might be a risk with doing the same thing.

Negative 1004 pPlease consider I have 2 forms which will put in single view which are student form and teacher form. Each has different form action.

Negative 1004 pI would like to use the EZAudio framework to do realtime microphone signal FFT processing, along with some other processing in order to determine the peak frequency. p  pThe problem is, the EZmicrophone class only appears to work on 512 samples, however, my signal requires an FFT of 8192 or even 16384 samples. There doesnt appear to be a way to change the buffer size in EZMicrophone, but Ive read posts that recommend creating an array of my target size and appending the microphone buffer to it, then when its full, do the FFT. p  pWhen I do this though, I get large chunks of memory with no data, or discontinuities between the segments of copied memory.

In the beginning we had around 156 emails which resulted in approximately 23000 terms and everything worked as it was supposed to using the following codep  precodepublic static double[,] GetPCAComponentsdouble[,] sourceMatrix, int dimensions  20, AnalysisMethod method  AnalysisMethod.Center        Create Principal Component Analysis of a given source     PrincipalComponentAnalysis pca  new PrincipalComponentAnalysissourceMatrix, method       Compute the Principal Component Analysis     pca.Compute       Creates a projection of the information     double[,] pcaComponents  pca.TransformsourceMatrix, dimensions       Return PCA Components     return pcaComponents  codepre  pThe components we received were classified later on using Linear Discriminant Analysis Classify method from the Accord.NET framework. Everything was working as it should.p  pNow that we have increased the size of out dataset 1519 emails and 68375 terms we at first were getting some OutOfMemory Exceptions. We were able to solve this by adjusting some parts of our code until we were able to reach the part where we calculate the PCA components. Right now this takes about 45 minutes which is way too long. After checking a hrefhttpaccordframework.netdocshtmlTAccordStatisticsAnalysisPrincipalComponentAnalysis.htm relnofollowthe website of Accord.NET on PCAa we decided to try and use the last example that uses a covariance matrix since it says Some users would like to analyze huge amounts of data. In this case, computing the SVD directly on the data could result in memory exceptions or excessive computing times. Therefore we changed our code to the followingp  precodepublic static double[,] GetPCAComponentsdouble[,] sourceMatrix, int dimensions  20, AnalysisMethod method  AnalysisMethod.Center                Compute mean vector         double[] mean  Accord.Statistics.Tools.MeansourceMatrix           Compute Covariance matrix         double[,] covariance  Accord.Statistics.Tools.CovariancesourceMatrix, mean           Create analysis using the covariance matrix         var pca  PrincipalComponentAnalysis.FromCovarianceMatrixmean, covariance           Compute the Principal Component Analysis         pca.Compute           Creates a projection of the information         double[,] pcaComponents  pca.TransformsourceMatrix, dimensions           Return PCA Components         return pcaComponents      codepre  pThis however raises an System.OutOfMemoryException. Does anyone know how to solve this problemp

Negative 1004 pIm trying to integrate some thirdparty SceneKit code into my app, and Im experiencing a mysterious crash.  Oddly, the crash gives no error or log in Xcode, and the stack trace is just UIApplicationMain.

Negative 1004 pI have a simple app developed using Ember. It is more of a pet project than anything else. As I am familiar with Jetty, so I just deployed it into Jettys webappsROOT. The problem is, I have to start the app with the root url a hrefhttplocalhost8080 relnofollowhttplocalhost8080a. If I enter something like a hrefhttplocalhost8080foobar relnofollowhttplocalhost8080foobara in browsers address bar, I will get a 404. But I can go to that page by clicking some link in the root page.p  pTo my understanding, the reason why directly entering the nonroot foobar url not working is that Jetty is trying to locate the foobar resource. Since the foobar resource is only resolvable inside the Ember app, Jetty cant find it and hence it fails to enter nonroot url directly. However, my question is, how can I make that directly entered url work If it can not be done or not easily be done with Jetty, I am open to use another http server.p

Negative 1004 pWhile the actual code markup is pretty well explained, in Google  a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comstructureddatarichsnippetsreviews relnofollowdevelopers docsa, it is unclear where in a web page or on which pages the markup needs to occur and in what relation to the actual reviews that are aggregated.p  pFor example, I see many pages around the web that are getting rich snippets with reviews, however when you visit the page, there are no visible reviews or indication of where those reviews are coming from. Example Google search radio connections Los Angeles p  pI think this type of implementation may be against Google guidelines, but the guidelines are unclear. Do aggregateRatings need to reference where those ratings originate Do they need to be on the same page as the individual reviews or ratings p  pIm talking in a strict whitehat way, because it seems that to get the rich snippet in Google, the aggregateRatings do not actually need to reference or be connected anything and are essentially selfcontained.p
Negative 1004 pI have a use case where I need to draw a component consisting of around 100 lines and up to 1000 other elements rectangles and text, mostly.p  pThe content of the component should resize when the Parent node changes its size e.g. when the application window changes its size.p  pI can think of two approaches how to deal with thisp  ol liUse JavaFX Line, Text, Rectange etc. Nodes and bind the widths and heights to the parent Node.li liAs in 1. but, instead of binding, develop a Pane which layouts the elements accordinglyli liUse the Canvas node and draw everything like with Graphics2D in Swing.li ol  pWhich approach would be faster How large is the impact of using bindings to change the size of this number of Nodes p  pIs it possible to ensure, using the NodeBinding approach, that the lines are crisp AFAIK the lines need to be drawn subpixel to be crisp, so adding 0.5px to the position is necessary. But is it possible to do this conditionally in a Binding I already tested adding 20 Lines to the Pane and Binding their yposition to the height of the Parent, but some are drawn crisp and some are blurry.p  pIf creating a new container which layouts its children like VBox and so on is the best option, how complex would be the taskp

Negative 1004 pI was wondering if there is any API which helps us access the lock code for your phone from your code. I was basically trying to use it to provide two way authentication for my application. But couldnt come across any. p  pI know ways where you can figure out if the phone is locked using pattern lock or pin or stuff like that. But I want to know if we could actually access these codes and use them as a way of authentication in our codep  pWould appreciate any help.p

Negative 1004 pI have an UL. Each LI element contains an image and a div element. The div element is supposed to be hidden and shows up when the user hovers over the image to display more information about the image. And I just want the div element to just overlay on top of the other li elements. p  pThe problem is when the div element is shown, it expands the size of the li element and pushes other li elements out of place. I figured out a solution to this by specifying the size of the li element to a specific size with px. However, I dont really want to do that because its not good responsive design. When I use percentages, it does not work because the size of the UL element increases when the div element is shown, therefore, the size of li also increases automatically. p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecodelist  liststylenone overflowinitial width20  list li  displayinlineblock floatleft overflowvisible  .additionalInfo  positionrelative backgroundcolorwhite top20px left40px displaynone   .clearer clearboth codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltul idlistgt ltli classlistItemgt ltpgtimage here.....................ltpgt ltdiv classadditionalInfogt ltpgtadditional infoltpgt ltpgtadditonal infoltpgt ltdivgt ltligt ltli classlistItemgt ltpgtimage here.....................ltpgt ltdiv classadditionalInfogt ltpgtadditional infoltpgt ltpgtadditonal infoltpgt ltdivgt ltligt ltli class  .clearergtltligtcodepre div div p  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.nethduof4uk relnofollowDemo with image substituted with just plain text for simplicitya.p

Negative 1004 pUWP apps are supported by the Azure Storage SDK, but only a few methods for reading from Azure table storage are implemented. For example, the most basic query on a table is typically done using the CloudTable.ExecuteQuery method, but that method isnt exposed to UWP apps. In fact, the only query method that seems to be implemented is CloudTable.ExecuteQuerySegmentedAsync which is overkill for a simple query that returns 5 or 10 rows and will never need a token.p  pIs the storage SDK not the preferred means of UWP apps interacting with table storage Is the SDK assuming that all UWP apps will ever need is tokenized and segmented queriesp

Negative 1004 pI am writing a ASP.NET ApiController that is hosted on IIS. In an action I need to invoke a Web Service named A provided by a company named Tencent. The service requires that I use a key to authenticate. The key is generate by calling another web interface, named B from Tencent and key is valid for 3 hours. Service B has a limitation on calls per day. Therefore I cant call B whenever I want to use A. I can only call B once and store the key in the database for future use.p  pThat means every time I want to use Service A, I need to check the validation of key from database, and if its expired, call B and get a new one.p  pNow, when I need to renew my key by calling B, what if before a new key is returned, the ApiController action is called again The new request would also find that the key in database is stale, then goes on calling B again, invalidating As newly gained key, causing A to fetch key again, endless loop.p  pMy questions is, how do you get rid of this kind of worry How do I start From SQL or IIS or ASP.NET p  pI am readingwriting database with EF6 and using ASP.NET MVC 5.p  pThanks for your helpp  p Complement  I was advised to use lock keyword.

The currentTime is at 2160707 from the manifest.mpd, and the duration is 4.99 enormous. videojs seams to have some problem with infinite, but that is not important herep  pWhen the video proceeds, the SeekHandle stays at position 0, because the duration the enormous number is too high, and cannot be reached. videojs seams to progress the SeekHandle in percentage of the duration. When I set the duration to the currentTime,p  precodeplayer.ontimeupdate, function      this.durationthis.currentTime  codepre  pthe SeekHandle appears at the end.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comu1G17.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comu1G17.png altap  pWhen I now try to seek in the SeekBar, the SeekBar contains the values from 000000 to the durationvalue currentTime  2160707. As of the nature of a stream, I can not seek back to the beginning of the stream, but thanks to dvr i can go back 15 minutes. p  pThis means, I want to be able to seek from currentTime15min 2155207 to currentTime 2160707. To achieve that, I would have to alter the startvalue of the SeekBar, and that is exactly where I am lost. i do not know how to alter it from 000000 to currentTime15min 2155207p  pstrongtldr How can I change the startvalue of the videojs SeekBar on init or laterstrongp

Negative 1004 pI m developing an application using SignalR to manage websockets and allow my clients to dialog between each other.p  pI m planning to host this backoffice on an Azure worker role. As my SignalR requests carry data that is most of the time saved in the database, I m wondering if NoSQLs MongoDB instead of the classic SQL ServerEntity Framework couple should be a good approach.p  pAssuming that my applications data types will be strings for most of them, I think MongoDB will be a reliable and a performant solution, and it will allow me to get rid of Azures SQLs database costs.p  pFor information, the Azure worker role will be running on a machine with the following hardware 1 core CPU, 3.5GB RAM and 50GB SSD storage.p  pDo you think I m on a good start with this architecture p  pThanksp

Negative 1004 pIm using Liquibase to version my Oracle DB schema my system is made up of the following Maven projectsp  ul lipcodedbschemacode a Maven project which contains the Liquibase changes to my DB.

Includes the DAL as a Maven dependency. pli ul  pEverything is Gitversioned and deployed onto a private Maven repository so that the dependecies of codedbschemacode and codedalcode can be resolved.p  pThe point is that this system should be deployed via a Continuous Integration system like Jenkins onto different environment, machines and with different credentials. This means also that different DBs will be used and so the liquibase.properties stored into the dbschema project cannot be deployed into the Jar onto the private Maven repository becaus it is not unique for all environments and is also a security risk to share credentials on Git and Artifactory.p  pSo, I need a way to easily externalize the liquibase.properties file giving different properties for different environments to the Maven codeliquibaseupdatecode goal of the codedbschemacode project.p  pThese are the ideas I came top  ul liConfigure the Maven Liquibase plugin to read the properties from the a hrefhttpsmaven.apache.orgpom.htmlProperties relnofollowenvironment variablesa.
