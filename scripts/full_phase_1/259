Positive 259 pI cant understand the solution for the following problemp  pAlice and Bob are playing a game.p  pIn this game, the players are supposed to show at the same time using the hands an integer between 0 and 10 million. If the numbers shown by both players are equal, we have a tie. Otherwise, the players alternate writing down numbers in a piece of paper. p  pLet A be an integer shown by Alice in the beginning of the match and let B be an integer show by Bob, each number written down must be a product of A  B factors, with all factors being prime numbers, not necessarily distinct, belonging to the interval defined by the integers A and B.p  pAlice always play first.p  pFor example, if A  2 and B  5, there are only 10 numbers Bob Wins which can be written down in the paper, which arep  precode8  2 x 2 x 2    12  2  2  3   20  2  2  5   18  2  3  3   30  2  3  5   50  2  5  5   27  3  3  3   45  3  3  5   75  3  5  5   125  5  5  5   codepre  pThe input has two numbers A and B as described. p  pThe output has 1 line containing singly the match winners name, assuming that both players play optimally.

Negative 259 pI recently started learning Python and I was rather surprised to find a 1000 deep recursion limit by default.  If you set it high enough, about 30000, it crashes with a segmentation fault just like C.  Although, C seems to go quite a lot higher.p  pThe Python folks are quick to point out that you can always convert recursive functions to iterative ones and that theyre always faster.  Thats 100 true.  Its not really what my question is about though.p  pI tried the same experiment in Perl and somewhere around 10 million recursions it consumed all of my 4 gigs of ram and I used C to stop trying.  Clearly Perl doesnt use the C stack, but it does use a ridiculous amount of memory when it recurses  not terribly shocking considering how much work it has to do to call functions.p  pI tried in Pike and was completely surprised to get 100,000,000 recursions in about 2 seconds.  I have no idea how it did that, but I suspect it flattened the recursion to an iterative process  it doesnt seem to consume any extra memory while it does it. [Note Pike does flatten trivial cases, but segfaults on more complicated ones, or so Im told.]p  pI used these otherwise useless functionsp  precodeint fint i, int l  ifiltl return fi1,l return i   sub f  return f[0]1, [1] if [0]lt[1] return [0]   def fi,l    if iltl      return fi1,l    return i codepre  pIm very curious how other languages e.g., PHP, Ruby, Java, Lua, Ocaml, Haskell handle recursion and why they handle it that way.  Additionally, please note whether it makes a difference if the function is tailrecursive see comment.p
Negative 259 pI have a bit of a problem.  I wrote an API a long time ago for our production system, and it used Apache XML Beans.

Ive since written a far simpler and more elegant restful API using JAXB, with parts of the old one in mind, ie different schema, but some of the elements are identical.  In the hopes of cleaning up and simplifying my binding code in the old API, Ive replaced some of the parts by deleting them and importing the new schema and using those elements instead.  However, whenever I try to parse documents that use the new mixture of schema, I get a validation error from XML Beans p  precodeerror cvccomplextype.2.4a Expected element redundantelementhttpwww.my.comoldxmlns instead of redundantelementhttpwww.my.comnewxmlns here in element redundantelementlisthttpwww.my.comoldxmlns codepre  pHas anybody encountered this before  Have any solutions or ideas  Id really appreciate it.

This means appending a configuration line if it is missing, modifying it if it is there, leaving everything else as it is.p  pCurrently I use something like thisp  precode initialize BEGIN    somevalueset       0   othervalueset      0    somevaluedefault   some.valueSOME VALUE   othervaluedefault  other.valueOTHER VALUE    modify existing lines    if some.value.         gsub., somevaluedefault     somevalueset  1      else if other.value.        gsub., othervaluedefault     othervalueset  1      print 0    append missing lines END    if somevalueset    0 print somevaluedefault   if othervalueset   0 print othervaluedefault  codepre  pEspecially when the number of lines I want to control gets larger, this is increasingly cumbersome. My awk knowledge is not all that great, and the above just emfeelsem wrong  how can I streamline this p  pP.S. If possible, Id like to stay with awk. Please dont just recommend that using PerlPythonwhatever would be much easier. p
Negative 259 pIm trying to make use of a dictionary plist as shown below img srchttpi42.tinypic.com14uwffa.jpg altalt text p  pI read it into a temp dictionary just fine.p  pWhat Id like to know is if there is an easy way to get at the string children which are actually a single element in an array, as you can see.p  pI initially tried objectAtIndex but that was, of course, returning an array, not the string value. I next tried using an NSEnumerator an objectEnumerator and then use objectAtIndex0 to get me the string which does work.p  pBut Im really hoping there is an easier way to do that.p  pEdit clarifying what Im trying to do.p  pI want to use the key values e.g. All Items to populate a tableview cell.text and then use the string values e.g. find.png in order to help populate cell.image via UIImage imageNamed. I would prefer NOT to use hardcoded values such as objectForKeyAll Items so that I can change the data in the plist without also making code changes.p

Negative 259 pResearch code is often held up as a paragon of what emnotem to do when writing software.  Certainly, the kind of code that often results from trying to solve a research problem can end up being poorlydesigned, difficult to debug, etc.p  pBut my question is this does research code have to be this way  Is it possible to write emgoodem research code  Is the only approach to consider the first version a poorlywritten prototype to be discarded in favour of the betterdesigned second versionp  pSoftware engineering has all sorts of best practices about how to design and write good code, but I dont usually find this relevant when you dont have a good idea ahead of time what the final system will look like.  The final system is likely to be a result of what did or didnt work along the way, and the only way to determine what does or doesnt work is to write the code first.  As you find things that dont work, you change what the final system looks like, moving further away from your original design assuming you had one.p  pId be interested in any personal experience with these issues, as well as any books or other resources anyone can point me to.p

Negative 259 pto start with Ive gone through the entire notepad tutorial, Im a professional game programmer who has some extra time. though most of my time has been in C, I did take a year or two of Java classes in college, and remember some of it.  p  pIm not sure the site is a good site to ask questions like this.. If someone has a Forum that might be a good place to ask these newbie questions, please feel free to point me in the direction. p  pIve examined a few of the samples, and think Ive a grasp of what I want to do.  Ive a three to four project plan for some Android releases to sharpen my skills, but since this is my first project and I have never really developed for a mobile phone or the android before, Id like to make sure I have a solid plan.p  pThe first project is an example of the license plate game, however I want to do a few things to change it.  Heck maybe when Im done itll become a bingo style game, with bluetooth connectivity, you never know. p  pThe base idea is I want to offer a list of states, with checkboxes next to them.  so to do this, Ill be starting with a Linear List layout similar to the note pad example, and then have a row that is only a Checkbox.  I can use text and call strike through if its been checked off.   Perhaps offer an option to not show them if they are checked.p  pBut I want the list to be generated from a set of lists.  Maybe all of Americas states, maybe reasonable American states no Hawaii, no Alaska maybe a North American list, add in Mexico and some Canadian provinces, a European list, who knows.  p  pId probably have to have a pop up window that lists all of the lists I suppose using a radiogroup of some sort. p  pSo then as far as the data, after weighing options I think best solution is to make a database with two fields, checked and name.p  pI figure I can use the menu for most of the user interaction aside from clicking on stuff we want to check off with maybe a few context menu items, I understand how to make all of those already so I should be good. p  pThe question I have is what is the best way to populate the lists  Should I create raw data, and have different files for all the lists   Or is there some other way to do this  Ive seen this done on the searchable dictionary, but Id like to hear what people who have actually generated the data like this before. p  pIn addition is there an easy way to look at the sql database these applications create, or do you have to run searches on them and output the data p  pFinally any other suggestion or advice   I definitely want to try to get something like this on the market so I can see the full life cycle and see if anyone actually likes it.  luckily theres not a plethora of them already but I also want a few people to look over my code if theyre willing when Im done to make sure Ive done this right or at least not missing any basic mistakes.p  pThank you for your time,p  pFrank p

The funny thing is that no syslog output is ever seen in the controller process unless I include the ifdef section below. p  pThe worker processes logs flawlessly in Mac OS X and linux with or without the ifdefed section below. The controller also logs flawlessly in Mac OS X without the ifdefed section, but on linux the ifdef is needed if I want to see any output into syslog or the log file for that matter from the controller process.p  pSo, why is thatp  precodestatic int lockdownvoid      struct rlimit rl     unsigned int n     int fd0     int fd1     int fd2       Reset file mode mask     umask0       change the working directory     if chdir lt 0         return EXITFAILURE       close any and all open file descriptors     if getrlimitRLIMITNOFILE, amprl         return EXITFAILURE     if RLIMINFINITY  rl.rlimmax         rl.rlimmax  1024      for n  0 n lt rl.rlimmax n  ifdef linux                 if 3  n  deep magic...             continue endif         if closen ampamp EBADF  errno             return EXITFAILURE            attach file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 to devnull     fd0  opendevnull, ORDWR     fd1  dup2fd0, 1     fd2  dup2fd0, 2     if 0  fd0         return EXITFAILURE      return EXITSUCCESS  codepre  pcamh was close, but using closelog was the idea that did the trick so the honor goes to jilles. Something else, aside from closing a file descriptor from under syslogs feet must go on though.

Apparently it did not. An explicit closelog on linux was needed to tell syslog that the descriptor was closed. p  pOne more thing that still perplexes me is that not using closelog prevented the first forked process the controller from even opening and using a log file. The following forked processes could use syslog or a log file with no problems. Maybe there are some caching effect in the filesystem that make the first forked process having an unreliable idea of which file descriptors are available, while the next set of forked process are sufficiently delayed to not be affected by this p

Negative 259 pI have a general question regarding Androids separation of layouts into layout.xml filesp  pMy app needs to display a table where the number of rows and columns varies at runtime. So far I did the layout up to the TableView in the corresponding layout....xml file and then I added TableRows and cells TextView to the table at runtime as needed. The drawback of adding rows and cell programmatically is, that one can not really change the design later e.g. changing colors or margins for the cells without later code modification.p  pWhat I would this like to do is to add a single row to the table and a single cell to the row in the layout file and then use these as a pattern or templates to generate all the actual tables rows and cells. This would allow to specify colors and other parameters in the layout.xml file and thus also be able to change them later without code change but still allow for an arbitrary number of columns and cells.p  pHowever, I found no copyconstructor or duplicatemethod in Views. How can one achieve this What is the suggested method to create lists or tables from a single example or template element Or is there another method to achieve what I want p  pHope I could make myself clear...

Negative 259 pIn a DDD pattern should the unit of work be coupled with the repository Ive seen several different examples, including a repository that implements a unit of work interface, a repository that implements the behavior for unit of work itself, and a repository that has a property representing the unit of work so that it can be shared across multiple repository instances in the lifetime of the UoW. In the case of the latter, it kind of seems like an antipattern...that is, should a consumer really need to know to share an instance of UoW across repository instances Shouldnt that be encapsulated and not exposed to the consumerp  pId like to hear some input on the advantages of these different approaches over each other and why.p  pThanks.p

This does work well, and its code thats been in use for around 4months without any problems.p  pHowever, I wrote this code, without thinking too much at the beginning of my internship.

Negative 259 pFirst let me say Im fully aware sql server does not short circuit evaluate. It can if it sees fit because of the execution plan, but its best not to guess.p  pIm wondering if it can be forced in any specific situations regarding a null  such as a dynamic loading of all customers in this queryp  pre declare customerId int  set customerId  null select  from customer where  customerId Is Null Or CustomerIdcustomerId  pre  pCustomerId is a PK int, not nullable p  pQUESTION Does anyone know if the engine will always choose the left hand side in this case or if we would indeed end up checking if CustomerIdnull on the right hand side for every row. Im guessing this isnt guaranteed to work since the right hand side may be less selective but Im curious if sql server sees the null and knows in every case like this to use the left hand side because of the null statement.  I believe this is best done as a case stmt below if you can better the query below please do but Im just curious in this case for learning purposes if anyone is aware of a consistent internal behavior here. It works in all of my cases but its also a primary key, not nullable so that may be why this always works. if its a nullable type then the right hand side may be less selective than the left and we now are dealing with a different situation. p  pMy execution plan in both queries seems to be the same.p  panyways  a potentially better way to write this please enhance it if you canp  pre   declare customerId  int set customerId  null  select  from Customer where   case      when customerId is null then 1 end  1  or  case      when customerId is not null then customerId     else 1 end  CustomerId  pre  pThe idea here is to have workarounds for dynamic sql  so I just want to make sure Im aware of all situations.p  pThanksp

Negative 259 pIve recently started getting into low level stuff and looking into bootloaders and operating systems etc...p  pAs I understand it, for ARM processors at least, peripherals are initialized by the bootloader and then they are mapped into the physical memory space. From here, code can access the peripherals by simply writing values to the memory space mapped to the peripherals registers. Later if the chip has a MMU, it can be used to further remap into virtual memory spaces. Am I rightp  pWhat I dont understand are assuming what I have said above is correctp  ul liHow does the bootloader initialize the peripherals if they havent been mapped to an address space yetli liWith virtual memory mapping, there are tables that tell the MMU where to map what. But what determines where peripherals are mapped in physical memoryli ul
Negative 259 pI have a Java webapp running on Tomcat, with Hibernate and C3P0. All entity classes and JPA Controllers were done with Netbeans wizzard. There is a servlet that when called inserts many objects in the database using the JPA controllers.p  pThe problem is that looking at my webapp with Java VisualVM I found that there are a lot of Timers and com.mchange.v2.async.ThreadPoolAsynchronousRunner classes, and it grows as time pass. For every Timer there are 3 Threads created.p  pAll the Threads and Timers are in WAIT state, and I think that this problem may be behind an OutOfMemory error Java Heap Space that the app. produces. And even though I see at MySQL Administrator that all the connections are closed when the servlet ends the task, may be some objects are still in memory.p  pIs it normal that C3P0 creates leaves more than 700 Timeras and 2100 Threads in WAIT statep  pThanksp  pEzequielp

Negative 259 pIm reading Douglas Crockfords emJavaScript The Good Partsem, and Im a little confused about something.

And to my knowledge, the Number object does not inherit from the Function prototype though maybe Im wrong there. I see that this works, but I dont understand why Number objects are able to make use of this method method to add... methods.p

Negative 259 pI admit it. Im a mathematical imbecile. should I be attempting this at home Probably not without serious injury. Anyway. Anyone that has a bit of experience in games and physics who can review this code and provide insight into why there is a built in loss in velocity in prototype would be hugely admired.p  pthe concept the actor falls from the sky, at some point intersects a boundary trampoline.y after which gravity in this example a value of 1.6 stops operating and a restitution factor in this case a value of 6 takes over. p  pright now Im trying to create a zerosum situation where you have the same velocity coming out of the trampoline bounce hero.y  trampoline.y as you did going in. Thats just not the case as the traces reveal.p  pIve tried about five different approaches and this is the latest, given the insight that at any given tic of my game timer 33 ms we may have passed the boundary of the trampoline and thus the acceleration rules will have changed. I really thought I had it, but the results show a decrease in velocity after each bounce, which is not what I expected.p  pI submit the following code to your wizened reviewp  precodevar newVNumber if hero.y lt trampoline.y  newV  hero.velocityY  gravityAccelerationInPixels  else  newV  hero.velocityY  TrampolineActor.SPRINGACCELERATION   var newYNumber  hero.y  newV traceComing in y  hero.y   oldVelocity  hero.velocityY   newVelocity  newV   Change in V   newV  hero.velocityY  .

Negative 259 pI have this problem where a system contains nodes windows services that push messages to be processed and others that pull messages and process them. p  pThis has been designed in a way that the push nodes balance the load between queues by maintaining a roundrobin list of queues and rotating queues after each send. Therefore message 1 will go to queue 1, message 2 to queue 2 etc. This part has been working great so far.p  pOn the message pull end we designed it such that the messages are retrieved in a similar way  first from queue 1, then from queue 2 etc. In theory, each pull node sits on a different machine and in practice, so far, it only listened on a single queue. But a recent requirement made us have a pull node in a machine that listens to more than one queue One that typically is extremely busy and filled with millions of messages and one that generally only contains a handful of messages.p  pThe problem we are facing is that the way we architected originally the pull nodes goes from queue to queue until a message is found. If it times out say after a sec then it moves on to the next queue.p  pThis doesnt work anymore cause Q1 filled with millions of messages will be delayed approximately a second per message since after each pull from Q1 we will ask Q2 for a message and if it doesnt contain any we will wait for a second.p  pSo it goes like thisp  pQ1 contains 10 messages and Q2 contains nonep  ul liPull node asks for a message from Q1li liQ1 returns message immediatelyli liPull node asks for a message from Q1li li Waiting for a second  Q2 is empty and request times outli liPull node asks for a message from Q1li liQ1 returns message immediatelyli liPull node asks for a message from Q1li li Waiting for a second  Q2 is empty and request times outli ul  petc.p  pSo this is clearly wrong.p  pI guess I am looking for the best architectural solution here. Message processing does not need to be as realtime as possible but needs to be robust and no message should ever be lostp  pI would like to hear your views on this problem.p  pThank in advance Yannisp

Negative 259 pBackgroundp  ol lipDeveloping a trading system which subscribe to many events which are sent by API of Interactive Brokers. One interesting event is about my trading account value which fluctuates during trading hour so I would prefer to see the information with accountvalueupdate event immediately. I develop this one based on ActiveX api and c in Visual Studio 2010.pli lipthe presentation I wanna check this information is to use a gauge developed byhttpwww.devexpress.comProductsNETControlsWinFormsGauges. This gauge looks fancy but the principle should be similar to the normal gauge we use in Visual Studio. It seems like I could only update the value of the gauge by databinding since I tried to assign updated account value to this.myGauge.value and failed.pli lipI build up MySql connection between MySql and VS2010. I create only one table in MySQL which is called account. For the sake of simplicity, i only have two columnaccountID and accountValue and one rowwhich means when event comes with new accountValue, I just overwrite the value of accountValue last session then the number of row is always one. really simple idea......In that Gauge proporties I found databinng option and I setted up by using advanced option to navigate throw available table and bind it to the only useful column accountValue.pli ol  pIssuep  ol liI set up the default value of the accountValue as 500 as default for test. I build my software. The gauge shows 500 correctly. li liOf course, my real account value is not 500, so Now I click one button to connect to API and start listening the event. After few seconds, event arrives since I opened on Console for managing the mysql table and use select  from account to continuously watch the update. I noticed the value of accountValue columnTABLE WORKS RIGHT AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE ROW, OEVERWRITTING MODE becomes the right one, for example, 35000. li ol  pHOWEVER, THE GAUGE DOES NOT CHANGE AT ALL... Now If i closed my software and build again, the gauge shows the right value 35000. Now I shut down the api and no coming event and only use commandline of mysql to change the value of accountValue again to 500. NO UPDATING in gauge as well.p  pIt looks like the gauge only read the value of table during the build session or when it starts and never listen to the update of binding databases.p  pBy the way, I tried to set up the biding data mode to either onValidation or onPropertieschanged but it does not solve although the onPropertieschanged looks the right one....p

Negative 259 pAccording to a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSelectionalgorithmWikipediaa, the Selection Algorithm has runtime of codeOncode, but I am not convinced by it. Can anyone explain why is it codeOncodep  pIn the normal quicksort, the runtime is codeOn log ncode. Every time we partition the branch into two branches greater than the pivot, and lesser than the pivot, we need to continue process strongbothstrong sides of the branches, whereas Selection Algorithm only needs to process strongonestrong side of the branch. I totally understand these points.  But if you think of Binary Search Algorithm, after we chose the middle element, we are also continue searching strongonestrong side of the branch. So does that make the algorithm codeO1code emNoem, of course, the Binary Search Algorithm is still codeOlog Ncode instead of codeO1code. This is also the same thing as search element in a Binary Search Tree. We only search for strongonestrong side, but we still consider codeOlog ncode instead of codeO1code.p  pCan someone explain why in Selection Algorithm, if we continue search for emoneem side, it can be consider codeO1code instead of codeOlog ncode To me, I consider the algorithm to be codeOn log ncode, codeONcode for partitoning, and codeOlog ncode for number of times to continue finding.p

Negative 259 pemstrongLong versionemstrongp  pI have a very particular issue. Im a multimedia artist working at the moment together with an animator  we are trying to create an interactive animation that I want to make available online as a website and as free app on the App Store and the Android Market. But heres the key problem I am faced with now.p  pThe output video of the actual animation will be massive in resolution  probably something like 4 or more times the HD resolution, but its for a reason. The idea is to let the viewer only watch a part of the video at one time  like when panning around in Google Maps or any other canvaslike view eg. MMORPG or strategy computer games. So you only see a part of the whole image at one time, and then you can move around to see whats behind the corner.p  pSo the animation would be a Google Mapsalike canvas panning emand perhaps zooming if theres enough time to implement item but with strongvideostrong instead of images.p  pThe big problem that comes up is performance. I was thinking that the best way to make it run would be to scale down the video for different devices accordingly. But then even just considering desktop computers for now  scaling down to 720p for HD screen means there is in total of about 4 times 720p in resolution, which is probably too much for an average computer to decode Full HD is quite often already problematic  and the output resolution would be more than the 4K standard 5120 by 2880, whilst 4K is 4096x2160. Anyhow, that is unacceptable.p  pBut I reached the conclusion that there is really no point in decoding and rendering the parts of the video which are invisible to the user anyway why waste the CPUGPU time for that  since we know that only about 16th of the full canvas would be visible at any given time. This inspired an idea that maybe I could split the output video into blocks  something between 8 to 64 files stacked together side by side like cells in a table, then have a timecode timer playing in some variable and enabling the videoblocks on demand. As the user drags the canvas to the visible element it would automatically start the playback of the file at the given timecode read from the global variable. There could be some heuristics anticipating users movement and prematurely activating the invisible blocks in order to remove any delay caused by seeking within video and starting the playback. Then blocks which are no longer visible could deactivate themselves after a certain amount of time.p  pSo my first attempt was to try and see what are my choices platformwise and I really see it comes down top  ul liHTML5 with JavaScript heavily using codeltvideogtcode tagli liAdobe Flash using Flash Builder to deploy the apps to all the different devicesli ul  pAnd HTML5 would really be more preferable.p  pSo I did some research to see if it would be at all possible to even synchronize more than one video at a time in HTML5. Unfortunately its far from perfect, there are two available hacks which work well with Firefox, but are buggy in Webkit the videos often get out of sync by more than a few frames, sometimes even up to half a second, which would be quite visible if it was a single video split into blockssegments. Not to mention the fact that I have not even tried it on mobile platforms Android  iOS.p  pThese two methodshacks are Rick Waldrons sync as shown herep  pa hrefhttpweblog.bocoup.comhtml5videosynchronizingplaybackoftwovideos relnofollowhttpweblog.bocoup.comhtml5videosynchronizingplaybackoftwovideosap  pAnd the other one, also developed by Rick is the mediagroup.js this one doesnt work in Chrome at all a hrefhttpsgithub.comrwldrnmediagroup.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrwldrnmediagroup.jsap  pMy test here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netNIXinEQbAx10 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netNIXinEQbAx10ap  pIve hidden the controller, cause it is always playing back earlier than the rest of the clips for some reasonp  pSo after explaining all that I would really appreciate any feedback from you guys  what would be the best way of solving this problem and on which platform. Is HTML5 mature enoughp  pemstrongShort versionemstrong If I still havent made it clear as to what I need  think of a video zoomed in at 600 so that you cant see everything some bits are off screen and you need to pan around by dragging with your mouse or flicking your finger on mobile devices to see whats going on in different places of the video. How could I do that have the video run smoothly across platforms, while retaining the high quality and resolution of the videop  pThanks a lot, let me know if you need any more details or any clarification of the matter.p

Negative 259 pBasically what I need is to show the status of a fundraising using some kind of donut chart. Many people use a thermometer style or progress bar for that but I really would like to get as closer as possible of something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiouR5.png altp  pAfter I spent a lot of time researching I came up with a very easy solution to plot the donut using a hrefhttpcode.google.compflotflota, here is the demo a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net6b7nZhttpjsfiddle.net6b7nZap  pWhat Im missing now is a way to add the centered label. I dont have to say that if anyone can point me to a jQury plugin or something like that it will be even better.p  pI appreciate any help on this, thanks in advancep
Negative 259 pI have a toolbar at the bottom of my screen. I want to have two buttons on it, one on the left side, and one on the right. However, unlike a navigation bar, there are multiple spots that arent on each far side of the bar, but rather they stack next to each other from the left to right. p  pI tried using a fixed separator, however the length doesnt stay contant the button needs to stay on the far left while another is on the far right as orientation and device changes. So, how would I go about keeping the buttons on each side of the toolbar no matter the orientation and device I feel like there has to be an easier way than getting the device type and orientation and varying the length for each one.p  pI tried my best to explain, and I can understand if there was an issue understanding what Im trying to say. If you need any clarification or other details, just askp  pThanksp  ul liJakeli ul
Negative 259 pIm trying to do face detection in c with Neural networks and some basic image preprocessing. With AForge.NET I created NN and successfully trained it for detection is an image face or nonface. For faster learning I resized images to 20x20. Basically NN returns 1 for face otherwise 0. This works fine with image that contains extracted face but I want to apply it on new frame from webCam with my face and some background.  My issue is how to search through this frame and implement NN classifier on all 20x20 rectangles in my 640x480 image from webCam to find localization of face. p

Since my scripts do work for all other types of analysis I am wondering what might be going on.p  h2A bit about the analysis since I guess this plays into the problemh2  pThe different analysis are more or less timeseries extractions of voxels in the brain imagine a brain as a 3D matrix with time as the fourth dimension and matrix elements are called voxels. Any point in the brain has an activation value for every point in time. Then a timeseries is the vector of all activation values of a given voxel over time.p  pI then calculate the correlation coefficient between all the voxels gives me a square correlation matrix with dimensions voxels by voxels and return a vector of all the correlation coefficients lower triangle of the matrix as the output of the parallel processing.p  pNow for all the analyses that dont throw the error, I am averaging multiple voxels based on regional nodes and then using the average timeseries for this region  effectively doing two thingsp  ol lidrastically reducing the number of voxels to the number of regionsli ligetting rid of voxels which are always zero as a result of the averaging. no region will contain only zero voxelsli ol  pIn contrast, the analysis that gives the above mentioned error uses all voxels timeseries in the brain, resulting in a much larger correlation matrix.p  pI tried to get rid of zerovoxels by masking every subjects file and also, I am not getting any division by zero errors but these are the only two things I can think of.p  pAlso, as said above, the parallel part of the processing runs through without problems. The error gets thrown after it ran, possibly during the remapping of the results.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. Also, if I should provide additional details, please let me know.p

Heres the questionp  pAfter getting the broken pipe exception if I query the Sockets emisClosedem method it returns false  i.e., its not closed, and if I query the Sockets emisConnectedem method it returns true, i.e., that it IS connected.   Could someone please explain these results to me   Thanks in advancep

Negative 259 pIs there a way to avoiddisable keyword expansion in MKS Integrity 2009 p  pI found the parameter codeunexpandcode for codesi cicode which seems to have no impact at all. p  pThen there are the preferences that can be set with codesi setpreferencescode. When setting codekeywordExpandnoexpandcode for codecicode my sandbox file does not get changed. But if I create a new sandbox, the keywords are substituted again.p  pThe user manual suggests, the substitution takes places at checkout actually. But then, I wonder why there is a preference codekeywordExpandcode for checkin at all. Setting codekeywordExpandnoexpandcode for codecocode doesnt help either. p
Negative 259 pI have a procedure for screen capture. It works fine in main thread. But I need to do it in work thread. So I get ERRORACCESSDENIED when GetDc is called. I check error with GetLastError. This error I get only on Windows XP machine. Test in Windows Vista and 7 is working ok. Test program is simple GUI with main form so it is not console program. Thread I have for receiving commands from http client. So this program is actualy http server.p  pSorry I found out the problem is elsewhere. Runing test was not same. On XP I used remote desktop but on other Windows I run program normaly loged as normal user. So problem is access to desktop when app runs in background or from remote desktop. I have to find out how to acces to desktop when app is run with remote dekstop.p

Now we have switched to VS2012 but we want to continue building the projects with the VS2010 runtime we need to support Windows XP. p  pTo our understanding this could be possible using Windows SDK 7.1 as the VC compiler is there so we installed it. VS2012 recognized the SDK and now we have a codePlatform Toolsetcode named codeWindows7.1SDKcode.p  pThe problem comes when building the projects as some projects are returning ap  blockquote   perror MSB6006 CL.exe exited with code 1073741515.p blockquote  pAlso, projects depending on the MFCs are failing too. MFCs arent available with Windows SDK Does this mean that we need to buy VS2010 licenses to install them on machines with VS2012 just to build using the VS2010 compilerp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 259 pDuring the last days Ive tried to learn CSS and HTML, in order to make my first own theme for Tumblr dont judge me, seemed like a good platform for testing things. Ive ran into several problems which I was able to fix by myself, yet now Im at the end of my knowledge, and Google wasnt able to help me. Ive also tried to search this site, yet with no success. So if theres already a topic about this, Im terribly sorry.p  pBasicly, Tumblr adds an codeltpgtcodeTag around every codeltimggtcode you add, so the padding I applied to p also gets applied to the image, and Im unable to overwrite this. A dirty fix worked for some time, yet as Im trying to make the site responsive, I cant find any workaround or fix.p  pHeres the basic HTMLStructure for an entryp  precodeblockText     ltdiv classpostcardgt         blockTitle             lta hrefPermalinkgtlth2gtTitlelth2gtltagt         blockTitle         ltdiv classtextgt             Body         ltdivgt     ltdivgt blockText codepre  pWhich results in thisp  precodeltpgtDuis autem vel eum iriure dolor.ltpgt  ltpgtltimg srchttpi.minus.comdbmLqVdFyHN5Tg16.jpg altgtltpgt codepre  pI want some padding on both sides of a paragraph and some spacing at the end of one, so I added this CSSp  precode.postcard p, ul      paddingright 50px     paddingleft 50px     marginbottom 25px  codepre  pSo far, so good. Now, heres the main problem The image in a post should cover the whole width of code.postcardcode, while also being responsive. Using codemaxwidth 100code would work, yet because the img is inside a p, a total of 100px padding gets applied to it. The following code is a dirty fix, but is obviously not responsivep  precode.text img      width 700px     height auto     display block     margin 0px 50px  codepre  pSo how can I get rid of the padding for the image Many thanks in advancep

Negative 259 pIm trying to set up a networking event similar to speed dating but everyone can meet everyone.  People pair up and ask each other questions for 5 minutes and then rotate.  I have multiple groups of people interested in networking Meeting each other. Lets say for now I have group A and group B.  Groups may be based on age, interest, industry, etc  The groups are different sizes and there may not be enough time for everyone to meet everyone using this typical algorithmp  pa hrefhttpwww.slideshare.netMarkRodeffereasyspeednetworkingmethod2814054 relnofollowhttpwww.slideshare.netMarkRodeffereasyspeednetworkingmethod2814054ap  pSo I need a way to prioritize who meets who.  The members of group A are mostly interested in meeting others from group A.  The members of group B are mostly interested in meeting others from group B.  IE  The groups are mostly interested in networking within their own groups but are still somewhat interested in networking outside their groups.p  pThe question is, what would be an efficienteasy algorithm for prioritizing the matching so that group A meets each other and group B meets each other before the groups start getting mixedp

Negative 259 pI am trying to get this functionality going but am a bit uncertain and dont know how to approach it. I have a master page with a div called masterDiv. masterDiv makes a load call and loads content of an external html page called details.html from it content div. This is how I am doing itp  precode  masterDiv.loaddetails.html content codepre  pcontent loads up as expected and the url address pops in as httpwww.xyz.comdetailsp  pThis is all good and working, but then I thought of those users who may not have JavaScript endabled. I figure I would just direct those users to details.html page directly instead of having the Master Page load the content from details.html page. So now here is the issue, lets say if I send a user this linkp  precode    httpwwww.xyz.comdetails codepre  pAnd if that users browser doesnt have Javascript enabled then obviously JQuery cannot be invoked and therefore load call will not be made and so on. how can I direct the user to  details.html page directly, pleasep  pAny insight would be wonderfulp  pThank you.p

Negative 259 pIve recently entertained the idea of designing and developing a special mobile version of my website for the experimental web browser in Amazon Kindle. strongNotstrong Kindle Fire, but the eInk ones.p  pHowever, Ive failed to find any real resources on the web on this subject matter. I grant you, the market share for the Kindle browser must be so abysmal that most webmasters shouldnt even come to think of worrying about it. Even so, my website is ebookcentered, so I think a Kindlefriendly design would make sense for this case.p  pSo I ask you, what are the considerations on making a Kindlefriendly website in your opinionp  pWhat isare the screen resolutions and DPI I should design for How do I detect Kindle but not Kindle Fire via JSCSS media queriesp  pWhat browser engine do they use What is its HTML5 and CSS3 capabilities AJAX JavaScript timeouts jQuery animations Is there an emulatorequivalent for the PC I could test it withp  pOnly ever owning a Kindle Keyboard, what are the differences between the different iterations of Kindles again not Kindle Fire, in regards screen properties and technical capabilities Are there other electronic paper readers like Nook, Sony Reader and what have you that I should consider supporting Do they even have web browsersp  pAre there any other technical, design or philosophical questions I should take into account when creating a site for the purpose of displaying on an eInk screenp

Negative 259 pIve found many examples of DynamicProxy used to perform additional work when property changes in the object, but how do I not only emsetem the property value in the interceptor by calling codeProceedcode, but also emroll it backem, if something went wrong during interception itselfp  pUsecase here is this I use settings objects to provide setting values to some parts of the system, so they wont have to work with the configuration backend.p  pThese objects are also codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode, so if anyone changes the setting at runtime, the component which has the object gets notified about the change and can perform reconfiguration on the fly.p  pSo what I need to do is roll back the change of the property if codePropertyChangedcode event handler has thrown an exception the change led to misconfiguration or was invalid.p  pI wonder how it can be done.p  pstrongIve ended upstrong using both codeINotifyPropertyChangingcode and extended this interface a bit and codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode. Simply because the validation should be performed embeforeem the actual setting, becausep  ul liorder of events is not determined, and so the actual consumer of the setting can get the notification embeforeem it has been even validated, when you using only codeINPChangedcodeli liand overall the validation and consuming are different and should have different events one before the setting took place to prevent it from happening and one after  when the actual value of the property is already updated for the code to work as expected.li ul  pWhen I look at this now, the original design which the question is about seems bad to me.p

Negative 259 pIm playing around with a Kinect the original Xbox version on the libfreenect driver Im on Ubuntu 12.04 by the way.

As far as I understand, the Kinect is factory calibrated, and there is a lookuptable matching depth pixels to the proper RGB pixels.p  pI can open the Kinect just fine and retrieve the raw 11 bit depth data. That gives me values ranging nonlinearly from around 730 to 1045 for distances from 1 to 7.5 meter.p  pRunning codedevicegtsetDepthFormatFREENECTDEPTHMMcode makes the Kinect output distances in mm, so setDepthFormat seems to work.p  pRunning codedevicegtsetDepthFormatFREENECTDEPTHREGISTEREDcode seems to have no effect, as only the raw depth values are output.

Negative 259 pI have a JPanel subclass with custom paintComponent implementation. It is being refreshed at 50fps. It is typically in the range of 500x300 pixels in size. Im seeing some flickering not too bad but noticeable and Ive inserted some debug code that indicates that SwingEDT is skipping presumably redundant painting. I am guessing thats because the EDT is not giving enough time for paintComponent to always finish or it is taking too much time on the EDT.p  pMy thinking is that I need to take the code currently implementing paintComponent which is not very complex but not completely trivial either and refactor it so it is executed on its own Thread or at least not the EDT and draws to an ImageBuffer. I then implement paintComponent on my custom JPanel and draw render from the ImageBuffer to the screen actually to the buffer behind Swing components as my research into the solution led me some information about Swing being by default doublebuffered, though Im not completely clear on that. If it is true that the rendering from the ImageBuffer to the JPanel is faster than my implementation that constructs the ImageBuffer then I will be going in the right direction.p  pIs this the proper design direction for me to takep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI modified my implementation as discussed in reponses belowp  p1 Create a BufferedImagep  pcodeBufferedImage myBufferedImage  new BufferedImagemySize.width,mySize.height,BufferedImage.TYPEINTARGBcodep  p2 Create a Thread dedicated to peforming the processing to determine what is to be drawn.p  p3 Move the code previously in paintComponent to another method that is executed by the dedicated Thread. At the end of this method, call repaintp  p4 Create a new paintComponent that simply calls codeg.drawImagemyBufferedImage,0,0,nullcodep  p5 Where I previously would call repaint, trigger myThread to perform the drawing to myBufferedImage.p  pThis was a disaster, as predicted. Much worse flickering and sluggishness, partial paints, etc. I believe this was due to contention readingwriting myBufferedImage as mentioned below. So I then created a lock and lock myBufferedImage when I am writing to it in the dedicated drawing Thread and wait to get that lock in paintComponent before calling Graphics2D.drawImage The flicker and partial paints go away  but performance is no better maybe even worse than when I was doing all the calculations for the drawing in paintComponent and therefore in the EDT. p  pThis has me stumped at this point.p
Negative 259 pIve been doing some research and Im trying to figure out the best method to run one of our sites. In short, there will be about 100 subdomains and each subdomain has 21 cron scripts that need to be run. I have shortened it down to 11 by using some fopen functions where it can be used. Each subdomain uses the same APIs more less to extract data and store it in the local mysql DB. All subdomains have their own DB and it is not shared and information will never overlap between these databases as they are all unique pieces of data.p  pWe intend to host it on VPS hosting, which Im not sure would be the best idea, but it should do the job from what we are anticipating. Intervals for these 11 scripts are one of the followingp  p5 min, 8 min, 10 min, 15 min,30 min, 45 min, 1 hour, 3 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours p  pThe ones that run on under 10 minutes intervals are generally very quick to load under 20 secondsscriptp  pMy question is, what is the best waybest practices to opening this many scripts without... a. crashing the server b. slowing the server to something ridiculous c. Not timing out our cron scripts. p  pMy thoughts for a method  1 Create 11 cron scripts in total and run fopen functions with possible a sleep function inbetween each script. The problem is there may be 100 files that need to be opened per script.  2 Create 1100 cron jobs to run at set times.  3 Create maybe about 110 fopen cron scripts that will run 10 scripts per file.p  pIf anyone can help out with tips or tricks, that would be greatly appreciated p  pAlso, for server usage, dedicated or VPS be necessaryp

Negative 259 pSo I have an a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiIterativeclosestpoint relnofollowiterative closest pointa ICP algorithm that has been written and will fit a model to a point cloud. As a quick tutorial for those not in the know ICP is a simple algorithm that fits points to a model ultimately providing a homogeneous transform matrix between the model and points. p  pHere is a quick picture tutorial.p  pStep 1. Find the closest point in the model set to your data setp  pStep 2 Using a bunch of fun maths sometimes based on gradiant descent or SVD pull the clouds closer together and repeat untill a pose is formedp  p[Figure 2][2]p  pNow that bit is simple and working, what i would like help with is  strongHow do I tell if the pose that I have is a good onestrongp  pSo currently I have two ideas, but they are kind of hackyp  ol lipHow many points are in the ICP Algorithm. Ie, if I am fitting to almost no points, I assume that the pose will be badp  pBut what if the pose is actually good It could be, even with few points. I dont want to reject good poses. In fact from experimentation , with a good seed few points is actually better, but if the seed is bad then it is no goodpli ol  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHXR2x.jpg altFigure 5p  pSo what we see here is that low points can actually make a very good position if they are in the right place. p  pSo the other metric investigated was the ratio of the supplied points to the used points. Heres an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGsdpv.jpg altFigure 6p  pNow we exlude points that are too far away because they will be outliers, now this means we need a good starting position for the ICP to work, but i am ok with that. Now in the above example the assurance will say NO, this is a bad pose, and it would be right because the ratio of points vs points included isp  precode211 lt SOMETHRESHOLD codepre  pSo thats good, but it will fail in the case shown above where the triangle is upside down. It will say that the upside down triangle is good because all of the points are used by ICP. p  pYou strongdontstrong need to be an expert on ICP to answer this question, i am looking for good ideas. Using knowledge of the points how can we classify whether it is a good pose solution or not p  pUsing both of these solutions together in tandem is a good suggestion but its a pretty lame solution if you ask me, very dumb to just threshold it.p  pWhat are some good ideas for how to do thisp  pPS. If you want to add some code, please go for it. I am working in c.p  pPPS. Someone help me with tagging this question I am not sure where it should fall.p

Negative 259 pI have 180 SVM models to run concurrently. Currently I load the models into an array at the start. Then when I need to run the models, I use pthread to create 180 threads,  then each thread acquires the pointer to each model, and does some calculation.p  pMy concern is, creating 180 threads every time I want to do some calculation may create serious overheadand there are a lot of calculations to do.  So what I was thinking is, loading the SVM models into 180 threads at the start, and reusing them every time I want to do some calculation. p  pIs my idea at all feasible Loading different models into each thread and using all the thread at the same time I thought about thread pooling, but I dont think this is a typical thread pool use case.

Negative 259 pIm working on a small project with a few different types of arrays e.g. codedouble[]code, codefloat[]code, codeint[]code. For verification  testing  sanity purposes, Im printing out some of these arrays to the console as I go along. So I have multiple functions that look like these below simplified for this example  assume Im only dealing with singledimension arraysp  precodevoid Printfloat[] a  prints an array of floats      for int i  0 i lt a.Length i              Console.Writea[i]        void Printdouble[] a  prints an array of doubles      for int i  0 i lt a.Length i              Console.Writea[i]       codepre  pI, in my infinite wisdom, thought I could reduce some of the code duplication by simply creating a generic version of these functions. So I tried thisp  precodevoid PrintltTgtT t where T  Array      for int i  0 i lt t.Length i              Console.Writet.GetValuei       codepre  pIntellisense isnt complaining, but the compiler fails with a very interesting error p  blockquote   pcodeConstraint cannot be special class System.Arraycodep blockquote  pIve looked for an explanation similar to codeObjectcode or sealed classes, but havent found much, besides a mention a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary56b2hk61.aspxon msdna. Can anyone explain to me emwhyem this is the case Why cant I specify a type constraint of codeSystem.Arraycodep  pp.s. While typing this out, I realized that I can accomplish what I originally wanted more easily, with a simple function like thisp  precodevoid PrintSystem.Array a      for int i  0 i lt a.Length i              Console.Writea.GetValuei       codepre  pIs this why theres a special rule for arrays in the compilerp

They recommended I should develop in MFC. But I realized my productivity decreased. p  pNow its up to me what to use. So my questions is For the tasks this tool supposed to perform, is it worth going to MFC or its better I move to C or C CLR. Time is not the biggest concern if I gain significant improvement in terms of performance.p  pThis is the first part of development. Later, it needs to be expanded.

The data being read are binary images 25 MB 35 MB each. 1000s of images are stacked and processed not all at once, but pixel by pixel. I have implemented it in MATLAB so I have a fair idea about the process. Mainly, statistical analysis and Fourier analysis will be done on the data. Finally a point cloud is generated. I am thinking of using a PCL point cloud library which is in C. These are not very big, since I am displaying in MATLAb right now. In future, files might get bigger so we are moving to CC environment. Displayed data needs to have functionality such as selecting points, and displaying option to show propertiesplots of that particular point etc. emGraphics are not heavy to display, but more important is the ability to select a feature.emp

Negative 259 pIm currently creating a connect four game for fun and was just about finished when I decided that it would be cool to add a falling animation.

Negative 259 pI have a question about CPU virtualization from a virtual machine. I am not able to understand the difference between onthefly to native code translation and trapandemulate translation. p  pAs far as I understand, in the first case suppose I emulate binary code from a different platform the code is converted to the equivalent x86 instruction if I have an x86 CPU. Now in the trapandemulate method the virtual machine receives the ISA call from the guest OS and translates it to the equivalent ISA call for the host OS. p  pWhy do we need to translate from ISA to ISA Suppose I am running an Ubuntu guest on a Windows host. The Ubuntu ISA call is different from the Windows ISA call I understand that the Guest is not able to access System ISA on the host, only the monitor can do that. But why there is a need of conversion to the Host ISA The ISA depends also on the operating systemp
Negative 259 pIve recently looked at Modernizr and have read the documentation however a few things seem a little unclear to me. It appears from reading the documentation that Modernizr is primarily used to detect if certain things are available in a browser or not, for example borderradius, media queries etc. Does it fix these things to render as expected on older browsersp  pI read in the documentation about Polyfills but I am not exactly sure on how I would implement these to add rounded corners to a div on browsers that dont support them for example.p  pIn addition, can Modernizr be used to allow media queries to work in older browsers or again is it simply a way to detect if media queries can be used or not.p  pIf it is solely a detection tool then why is it so useful I know already that I cant use media queries or borderradius on older versions of Internet Explorer for example. If it is not solely a detection tool, then how can I use it to add newer functionality in older browsersp

Negative 259 pI have a question with regard to the most appropriate architecture on couchDB for a Messaging app use case I have.p  pThe use case is for a simple messaging platform which currently has one couch DB with all messages as documents.  Each document has a to field indicating the intended recipients of the message.  When a client app wakes up it queries the database for all new messages addressed to the specific user after the last check.  This is achieved by querying the changes feed with a normal filter checking for the presence of the users id in a to field in the document.p  pAs I understand couchDBs operation, this requires the database to retrieve all documents for the changes feed after the last sequence and run the filter function against them.  Since the likelihood of a new message in my use case is quite low, this would result in quite a large overhead Lets say I have 100 000 users each getting two messages per day, it will require the DB to read all 200 000 message 200 000 times to support all usersp  pOption 1 From what I read it is not possible to put a parametric filter on top of the changes feed.  This would be nice, since then I would have been able to use replication functionality to extract the messages.  Non Starterp  pOption 2 Implement a view with a key combining the to field and the update sequence. I can then query this view for the user value and sequence  last sequence.  Here I am struggling to gain access to the documents update Seq from the  Map function.   Is this viablep  pOption 3 Implement a database on the server for each user and set up replication on the common database to each user specific database.  The user then queries the changes feed of her own database which only has messages directed to her, so easy.  Now you need to maintain 100 000 x 2 replications on the server.  This has other drawbacks, but could work.p  pFrom the above, which sounds like the most feasiblescaleable approach  Or am I missing another optionp  pThanksp

Negative 259 pIm trying to efficiently plot tens of thousands of datapoints. For simplicitys sake lets say each datapoint contains 2 values. The first value is a decimal number.

Negative 259 pIt is very common for some of our inexperienced customers to mess around with the network settings on our devices. They often end up changing IP and subnet mask and then calling the support hotline and complaining about the device being unreachable. Therefore, we are trying to design a software that can detect the network configuration of the device, even if it is on a different network than the host PC. Is there anyway to achieve this, even if the MAC address is also unknown We will be using teamview to gain access to the customers PC.  p

Negative 259 pIm using a C library that has a few memory issues. Ive identified that sometimes it decreases the reference count too early, leading to segfaults, and managed to work around that by keeping a list of objects to inflate the reference count. On the other hand, Ive also identified specific cases where the reference count is too high. Is there any way to work around these cases, from Python code, by purposefully decreasing the reference countp  pI understand this is hackish and in no way clean code or anything, but Ive got to deal with the buggy C library somehow, and it seems this might be easier than figuring out where the issue in the C code is luckily its opensource, fixing it, then recompiling it on all the platforms I have to support.p

Is random matchmaking possible on the web Im look for a structure like thisp  ul lipThe user first logs onto a website and makes a name for him or herself, pli lipTHEN the person is able to click on a button that says Play Online and, using jquery, make a preloader while at the same time looking for a random opponent.

Negative 259 pI am trying to perform an upload to BigQuery from Perl with a sample schema and some sample data.  I ran into dead ends following the documentation they provide, and so now Im trying to mimic what the codebqcode command line client successfully does.p  pI am tracing what codebqcode does by adding a debug codeprint method, uri, headers, bodycode to the coderequestcode method in codehttplib2code.  I am tracing what my Perl library is doing by doing a codeDumpercode on the response, which also includes the coderequestcode that I sent.

The corresponding job is monitored with a series of codeGETcode requests, and finally they respond.p  pIn Perl my codePOSTcode succeeds, and my codeGETcode fails with codeInvalid Upload Requestcode but no hint why it is invalid.

Negative 259 pIn my application i have 3 nib files. In the first nib file i have a uiwebview which redirects the user to vimeo page for user authentication for my app, after the user presses allow in that link then the control is transferred to my app, after that to display the list of videos i designed a new nib file and the third nib file to play the video user selected. But i am not able to load the second nib file after the user approval.I tried these approaches After the user presses allow and i got the access. i removed the uiwebview then i tried to load the second nib using UInib , NSbundle but the nib dint appear, i have also tried creating a separate class for the new nib and assigning the files owner of that nib to the newly created class but that approach also dint work. Then i tried using appdelegate for loading the code. i write the code like this p  precode BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions  NSLogin the app delegate show UI  CustomInterface ci  [CustomInterface new]  [[NSBundle mainBundle]loadNibNamedInterface ownerci optionsnil]   UILabel lab  [ci valueForKeylabel]  [self.window.rootViewController.view addSubviewlab]  lab.frame  CGRectIntegrallab.frame   UITableView tab  [ci valueForKeytable]  [self.window.rootViewController.view addSubviewtab]  tab.frame  CGRectIntegraltab.frame return YES  codepre  pbut by using this the intital nib and the second nib both are loading when the app is launched but i want to load the second nib after the user authentication. I have tried many other techniques like creating a new delegate and class for second nib, creating a new method showSecondNib in the default AppDelegate but none of them worked. can you help me with this. Thank you.p

Negative 259 pIm not sure where and how to start, but I have a couple questions about the way how server and clients work with each other.

Negative 259 pFor a project, Im creating a hash table of strings. It uses separate chaining, and for each filled position in the table, a linked list is created.

If it matches the hash of another string, and the current string is NOT in the table, it will be appended to the list at this hash value, and will have a frequency of 1.p  p2.

Negative 259 pI am trying to understand the codeIEnumerablecode interface in C. As it is stated in a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.collections.ienumerable28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowMSDNabr codeIEnumerablecode exposes an enumerator, which supports a simple iteration over a nongeneric collection. This is quite simple. When we have a collection that implements this interface then, we get an enumerator, which implements the codeIEnumeratorcode interface, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.collections.ienumerable.getenumeratorvvs.110.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.collections.ienumerable.getenumeratorvvs.110.aspxa, and the using this enumerator we can iterate through all the elements of the collection in a way like the belowp  precodeforeachvar item in items       code goes here  codepre  pIn the above snippet of code, codeitemscode is a collection that implements the codeIEnumerablecode  interface. This is possible because the enumerator has a property called codeCurrentcode, which has the current element of the collection and a method codeMoveNextcode, which is used by the enumerator, to move to the next element. Last but not least, it has a method called codeResetcode, which sets the enumerator to its initial position, which is before the first element in the collection, as it is stated in MSDN.p  pLet we have the following snippet of codep  precodeint[] array  new int[10]  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  IEnumerableltintgt numbers  array foreach var number in numbers      Console.WriteLinenumber  codepre  pIn the above snippet of code we initialize an array of integers and then we define a type of codeIEnumerablecode that points to the array. Since codenumberscode implements the codeIEnumerablecode, we can iterate through its elements using the above codeforeachcode.p  pI think that the compiler behind the scenes emits some code, when we define the codenumberscode and then try to iterate through its elements. Actually I found that codeArraycode implements codeIEnumerableltTgtcode.p  pMy question is every time we define an array, since an array is an object that implements codeIEnumerablecode and codeIEnumeratorcode, the corresponding methods are implemented by the compilerp  pThanks in advance for any help p

Code above adds code1024code bytes alignment for widths which can not be divided by code32code and code2048code bytes alignment for other resolutions.

I was not able to calculate the padding which will work for both phones.p  pI also have access to codeSony Xperia Z1code running codeAndroid 4.3code with codeQualCommcode chipset and it looks like it does not have such problems. Video on every resolution looks fine and codeYcode plane does not needs to be aligned anyhow.p  pI understand that its hardwarerelated and might be complicated, but since I have to support users running Android prior to code4.3code I have a question. Is it possible to programmatically determine codeYcode plane alignment and vertical  horizontal stride values which encoder is expecting for the given color formatp

Negative 259 pstrongThe Scenariostrongp  pI have a codeUserControlcode which contains a couple of controls, one of which is a codeComboBoxcode. The codeUserControlcode is conatined with a codePagecode.p  pThe codeUserControlcode exposes a couple of dependency properties to allow the codeItemscode and codeSelectedValuecode of the codeComboBoxcode to be accessed. These are defined as followsp  precodepublic static readonly DependencyProperty SelectedValueProperty  DependencyProperty.RegisterSelectedValue, typeofint, typeofCustomComboBox, new FrameworkPropertyMetadataintnull, FrameworkPropertyMetadataOptions.BindsTwoWayByDefault public int SelectedValue      get  return intthis.GetValueSelectedValueProperty      set  this.SetValueSelectedValueProperty, value    public static readonly DependencyProperty ItemsProperty  DependencyProperty.RegisterItems, typeofListltComboItemgt, typeofCustomComboBox, new FrameworkPropertyMetadataListltComboItemgtnew ListltComboItemgt, FrameworkPropertyMetadataOptions.BindsTwoWayByDefault public ListltComboItemgt Items      get  return ListltComboItemgtthis.GetValueItemsProperty      set  this.SetValueItemsProperty, value   codepre  pThese are binded to the codeComboBoxcode control as followsp  precodeltComboBox ItemsSourceBinding PathItems, ElementNameThisControl DisplayMemberPathText SelectedValuePathID SelectedValueBinding PathSelectedValue, ElementNameThisControl, UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged gt codepre  pWhere the codeUserControlcode is named codeThisControlcode.p  pAlso, in the above, codeComboItemcode is a class which contains the definitions for each item, namely two properties called codeIDcode and codeTextcode. The idea here is that codeIDcode is the key that is stored in the database, and codeTextcode is the user friendly value that is displayed in the list.p  pWhen the codePagecode containing the codeUserControlcode is created using the Constructor, the ComboBox items list is populated with the following codep  precodeMyComboBox.Items.Clear MyComboBox.Items.Addnew ComboItem  ID  1, Text  One  MyComboBox.Items.Addnew ComboItem  ID  2, Text  Two  codepre  pFinally, the codeSelectedValuecode is binded to a class property via XML like sop  precodeltcCustomComboBox xNameMyComboBox SelectedValueBinding PathMyClassInstance.ItemID gt codepre  pwhere the property codeItemIDcode is of type codeintcode. It is important to note that the class instance is set emafterem the combo box items are populated.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pWhen the page is first shown, the initial selected value is not set correctly  it is an empty item selection. I can assure that the codeItemIDcode property is already set to a valid value i.e. code1code.p  pWhen an item is selected from the codeComboBoxcode, the binding emdoesem successfully set the codeItemIDcode property, and is correctly persisted to the database upon a save function.p  pOne strange behavior, which may help to identity the problem, is that if the window containing the codePagecode is closed, and then reopened. The codeComboBoxcode emdoesem get th correct initial value  and that is regardless of the ComboBox being set on first attempt, or otherwise.p  pSo, the question is Why is the initial value not shown the first time the page is displayedp

Negative 259 pIm running a basic taggingstyle system and am wondering how efficient my queries are. p  pMy specific use case involves tagging coderecipecode objects with codeingredientscode through a coderequirementcode object, which has a coderecipeidcode and an codeingredientidcode.p  pRecipes, ingredients and requirements are all completely siloed by codeusercode.p  pI want to be able to return a users recipes that include ALL ingredients in a given set. p  pThe way Im doing this, given a list of codeingredientidscode strong1,2strong and codeuseridcode of strong1strong, is like thisp  precodeSELECT recipes. FROM recipes    WHERE recipes.id IN      SELECT requirements.recipeid        FROM requirements        WHERE requirements.ingredientid IN 1, 2         AND requirements.userid  1       GROUP BY requirements.recipeid        HAVING COUNTrequirements.recipeid  2 codepre  pThis is returning the data I need but Im worried about its performance. The subquery doesnt look good because it is grabbing all requirements with ingredientid 1 or 2, grouping them by recipe and then counting them to match the given array size, simply to create an array against which to further query recipe ids.p  pBut the coderequirementscode table could be massive, as each entry manages one of potentially an nsquared number of bidirectional relationships between recipes and ingredients. So it doesnt make sense to me to query the whole table in this way.p  pAm I missing something p  pIve often heard that IN and NULL equality comparisons are so much faster than JOINs, but surely not when the complexity of the subquery negates the speed savingp  pIt seems like a very simple problem that Im overengineering, how would you improve itp
Negative 259 pI have a LibGDX scene with a couple of Images the Actor subclass. I want to drag one Image and drop it on another. I started with the source code located at a hrefhttpsgithub.comlibgdxlibgdxblobmastertestsgdxtestssrccombadlogicgdxtestsDragAndDropTest.java relnofollowDragDropTest.javaa. Since I basically want the source to be the payload Ive tried modifying codepayload.setDragActorcode to use the source Image. It kind of works, I need to add the code to place the payload actor back in the stage but that isnt my issue.p  pMy problem that that the payload when its the source actor or a separate actor doesnt really get dragged. Instead what happens is the payload actor positions itself slightly down and to the right of the mouse cursor. I want to place the payload, not point to where I want the payload placed. It doesnt feel like dragging at all, it feels like something is following the cursor. I see the same behavior on the Android emulator as I do on the desktop version of the app.p

Negative 259 pThis is a rather specific problem.p  pIm doing some work in a Java project that uses a database access framework, originally designed to work with Oracle DB 9i.p  pTo work on this project I needed an Oracle DB on my Mac, running OSX Mountain Lion, and the only apparent solution was to run it in a VM.  Therefore I downloaded the OTN Developer Day VM from a hrefhttpwww.oracle.comtechnetworkdatabaseenterpriseeditiondatabaseappdevvm161299.html relnofollowherea which comes complete with an Oracle DB 12c instance.p  pAfter jumping through various hoops, I have gotten my EclipseTomcatServlets setup to talk to the 12c database with the jdbc7 driver, which I downloaded from the Oracle site.  Everything works as expected, and as a note, Oracle SQL Developer connects to it just fine.p  pHeres the connection string Im using codejdbcoraclethinlocalhost1521pdb1code  I can log on as local users I have created within the default pluggable DB, or by using the connection string codejdbcoraclethinlocalhost1521orclcode I can log on as any of the common users that are set up.p  hr  pNow, the trick is when I want to use the Java DB access framework, designed for use with a 9i DB.  I get the error codeORA28040 No matching authentication protocolcode.p  pBased on what I could find, such as a hrefhttpscommunity.oracle.comthread2349728 relnofollowthisa Oracle thread, my 12c database is not configured to allow 9istyle authentication due to security holes in 9i.  So to fix this, I need to set my DB to allow this by going to this filep  pcodeu01apporacleproduct12.1.0dbhome1networkadminsqlnet.oracodep  pAnd adding the linep  pcodeSQLNET.ALLOWEDLOGONVERSION9codep  pNote that I have also tried code8code, as well as code12,11,10,9,8,7code and other such oddities, and I still experience the following.  Ive also seen codeSQLNETALLOWED...code, the underscore instead of the period, but I think thats for older Oracle DB versions.p  pWhen I do this, and reboot the VM, I can no longer connect to the DB.  When I attempt to connect to codepdb1code I getp  precodeAn error was encountered performing the requested operation  IO Error The Network Adapter could not establish the connection  Vendor code 17002 codepre  pAnd when I attempt to connect to codeorclcode I getp  precodeAn error was encountered performing the requested operation  Listener refused the connection with the following error ORA12528, TNSlistener all appropriate instances are blocking new connections   Vendor code 12528 codepre  pWhen I go into the terminal in the VM and check the status of the service with lsnrctl something I found with a bit of Googling this happensp  precodeServices Summary... Service orcl has 1 instances.   Instance orcl, status BLOCKED, has 1 handlers for this service... The command completed successfully LSNRCTLgt  codepre  pUnfortunately, I am quite the lightweight on Oracle DB and DB administration in general I would prefer to simply code stuff and have the DB just emworkem, but I do need to get this DB access framework to work, and I only have a copy of Oracle 12c, not 9i, so Im in a bind.p

Negative 259 pI am building a small GUI application which runs a producer worker and the GUI consumes the output on demand and plots it using pyqtgraph.p  pSince the producer is a blocking function takes a while to run, I supposedly moved it to its own thread.p  pWhen calling QThread.currentThreadId from the producer it outputs the same number as the main GUI thread.

Negative 259 pIve been having to do one or other quite often  Ill give just one example I have a little box with overviews of certain data obtained in python, but which doesnt happen to have the entire dataset, on the other hand using codeflotdatalengthcode on the dataset I am passing with codejson.dumpscode gives the length of the string. So I added another helper dict with lenflotdata as a key value code flotextras.length codep  pThese kinds of redundant things happen on more than one occasion  strangely enough something like code flotextras.min code which is a nonjson Python dictionary works in Jquery, while passing the entire dictionary to a variable does not.  p  pWhats the optimal way to passrender a dataset and additional information when some of which needs to be rendered in Jquery and some of it by the Django template renderer  The redundancy seems inelegant, but as long as its only 10s or even 100s of value should I even be worrying about it p

Negative 259 pI have a codenavbarcode at the top of my screen with elements on the left and right and when I resize the window left or right, I want the elements to push together until they hit, and then have the window start hiding it. Currently once my elements hit, it tries to take the text on the left of the codenavbarcode and stack it underneath. I used minwidth on the list on the right and that worked fine, but minwidth on the text on the right is just adding space between my logo and textp  pSorry if this is confusing.

Negative 259 pI am trying to override Ext.util.Format.decimalSeparator and thousandSeparator. So, in my app, when I chnage the language to Spanish and I try using this function, Ext.util.Format.number1234,0,000, still it converts the number to 1.234 instead of 1,234. p  pI want that, irrespective of what language I choose, strongit should always format the money to 0,000 format and not using my selected localestrong, e.g., never 0.000. I observed if I change the thousandSeparator of Ext.util.Format object, it works fine. So, I added the following code in Ext.Loader.loadScript callback function in launch function in Application.js,p  precode        var utilFormatObj         utilFormatObj.thousandSeparator  ,         utilFormatObj.decimalSeparator  .         Ext.overrideExt.util.Format, utilFormatObj codepre  pBUt, it seems to work only in this place, once it loads the app on webpage, it again gets back to thousandSeparator.. I can see that extlanges.js file has the function which sets these properties. Can anyone suggest how can I catch whether the app is completely loaded on webapge and then use the above code there. Thank you.p
Negative 259 pIm working on a project by myself, and in two different machines where Im using Gulp, and the gulpfile has two main goals  generate the build default task and compile SASS to CSS, within the app source folder.p  pAny advice on avoiding people me included to update a .css file that would be eventually overwritten by a compiled .scss file with gulpwatchp  pIm also using Git and recently I lost some changes Ive made to a CSS file for that reason.

Negative 259 pEdit this is for EFv4p  pI am trying to use an Entity Data Model, but allow the user to select the database.  We have three tables which have the same data types and relationships between different databases.  Two tables which are linked manytomany by a crossreference table.  I want to create a simple program in C that allows the user to view and edit the data, and the user must be able to select from different databases which have those tables.p  pI have created an EDM with the wizard based on one of these databases, but its tied directly to that database, and for the life of me, I dont see a way to programmatically change it.  There is an option to pass a connection string to the entity objects constructor, but it just hangs when I do.  Every search Ive tried has only brought answers to how to change the data source that gets built into the software, rather than setting it based on user choice.p  pEven if I keep hacking and manage to make this work, I feel that it is clearly not the way it was designed to work, or I would have found the answer in the few hours of searching and hacking Ive already tried.  Can someone steer me in the right direction  Basically, I want to bind my form controls to some code that represents the rules of the schema, and my understanding was that EF is the forwardlooking way to do that.  I just dont get why it wouldnt be an option to allow the user to select the data source.p

Some of our clients operate in many countries and some of the orders are placed in the base currency of the company and will not need conversion and some are placed in other countries and will need conversion. We have a currencyrate in the orders table and if the rate is NULL then no conversion is needed and if a rate is there we multiply the order total by the rate for the conversion. My question is  I do not think INSULL will do the trick.p  precodeSELECT SumISNULLordertotal,0  ISNULLcurrencyrate,1 AS [Total]  FROM   orders codepre  pThe ordertotal is always stored in the db as the base currency of the company and only converted when needed for display purposes. Some engineers here are worried that this may work on the aggregate and not the row level.p

Negative 259 pfor a recent application I want to provide the ability to subscribe to a calendar feed while staying on the android device so going to calendar.google ... and manually adding the http link ics isnt an option. I cant really find a lot of information on this topic. Since it is a completely new app it doesnt have to be ics. Just anything that works ok on iOS AND Android. p  pOn iOS this is so easy as you can just programatically make a call with the .ics link and the user will get a question to subscribe. Android ICS also introduced the Calendar API but I havent really found any clues on how you can subscribe to a public ics with this. Dont think its possible as it just seems to be a way to actually make a new calendar or addchange events but not subscribe to a changing .ics feed. p  pAnyway, I just want to be sure that this is true and just not an option. wich is a fail of Android imho anno 2014p  pThere is another question on SO that is related with an answer of CommonsWare. But making the user install another app together with my app just isnt an option and is to much cumbersome. Only a library of some kind that could make the subscription would really make this process acceptable for use within an app.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23091666webcalsupportonandroidnotworkingisthereasupportedcalendarfeedalWebcal questionap

Negative 259 pI have the following Xaml using Xamarin Forms Labs.  The images are way too small, and the text is centered.  Im trying to get the images a little bigger, but the ImageHeightRequest attributes appear to have no affect.  I also tried several combinations of StackLayout formatting, such as HorizontalOptionsStartAndExpand on the StackLayout only, and as well as the elements.  This results in the buttons being squished to the left side, and not wide enough to display the whole text of the button. Does anyone have any idea how to implement this with larger images, and everything aligned to the left  I know the images are bigger, because Im porting this from Windows Phone to Xamarin, and the same images are larger on Windows Phone.

Negative 259 paccording to paper which written by chawla, et al 2002 the best perfomance of balancing data is combining undersampling with SMOTE.p  pIve tried to combine my dataset using undersampling and SMOTE, but I am bit confuse about the attribute for undersampling.p  pIn weka there is Resample to decrease the majority class. there is a attribute in Resample biasToUniformClass  Whether to use bias towards a uniform class. A value of 0 leaves the class distribution asis, a value of 1 ensures the class distribution is uniform in the output data.p  pI use value 0 and the data in majority class is down so the minority do and  when I use value 1, the data in majority decrease but in minority class, the data is up.p  pI try to use value 1 for that attribute, but I dont using smote to increase the instances of minority class because the data is already balance and the result is good too.p  pso, is that the same as I combine the SMOTE and undersampling or I still have to try with value 0 in that attribute and do the SMOTE p

Negative 259 pI have a video game app that I have created in Xcode, SpriteKit with a Game template application. My game has a score label that keeps track of the score and is updated when the player scores a point.

There is a lot more code in my app but I just wanted to simplify it and just show the code that is relevant to this situation. When i close the app down and reopen the app the score resets back to number zero.

Negative 259 pIm trying to read DICOM files in Android. I successfully made my own parser, I can read study data, grayscale images and several other types and display them successfully. Unfortunately I cant handle all the different compressions like JPEG2000 or JPEG LS lossless on my own or even if I could it would take me a lot of time and reading to write the code. I know I can request images from the server in a specified format without compression, but I need those files to be as small as possible because there are studies, more than 1GB large and  3G connection will be used to download them.p  pSo I decided to use a library  DCMTK in particular. Its written in C and I have to use Android NDK to build it but I have no idea how exactly. I read the documentation and the INSTALL file and I can build a visual studio project for example and use the DCMTK tools. I also read tutorials on how to build a simple NDK application for Android. But how to build a whole library, how to write my Android.mk file. DCMTK have CMAKE files, but how to use them for Android. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advancep

Negative 259 pI have implemented Asynchronous property in Servlet 3.0 as below. After implenting a runnable class at backend, I have observed that the 2 threads are created and one ends up in asunchronous manner and other does backend processing.

In the runnable class, I have kept a sleep of 25 seconds and I have tried using outStream.printlnCalendar.getInstance.getTimeInMillis in the servlet class, I have observed a deviation.The time value which is printed in println is the time when the request started but the outStream is printed on the URL hit page after 25 seconds.

Negative 259 pIm new to Flux as a whole, but Im trying to get a grip on it by starting with Reflux, which seems a bit more opinionated and simpler to learn. p  pAs I understand, Reflux stores have a codetriggercode method which indicates the stores data has changed, and they pass the updated data into it. This data can then be set as a React components state, or as one of the states properties using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comspoikerefluxjsusingrefluxconnect relnofollowReflux.connecta mixin or similar methods.p  pstrongBut what if a store has multiple sets of data that need to be listened to separatelystrong Lets say Im modifying the TodoMVC a hrefhttpsgithub.comspoikerefluxjstodo relnofollowRefluxJS examplea, and I wanted the TodoStore to also include a codetitlecode property that indicated the name of the todo list as well as the codelistcode, the list of TODO items. Lets say there is also a codeltTitlegtcode component that is listening for changes to the codetitlecode property, and setting the codetitlecode as its state when it does.p  pA call to codethis.triggertitlecode would update the title component, but would also cause the todo component to try to use the title string as its state, so we need a way to indicate which data has been changed. Should these two properties codetitlecode and codelistcode be separated into different stores Or should all calls to codetriggercode include a string that indicates the property codethis.triggertitle, this.titlecode or codethis.triggertodos, this.listcode. Or should all the data be combined into one object which is then picked by the listeners e.g. using codeReflux.connectFiltercodep  precodethis.triggertodos,      todos this.list,     title this.title  codepre  pThese last two examples introduce new data to the codethis.triggercode call, meaning that codeReflux.connectcode cant be used any more, because codeconnectcode takes the data returned from a store and directly sets the components state to it. Does this mean we have to use codeReflux.listenToTodoStore,onTodoChangecode, and then filter out the codetriggercode calls that arent relevant to this componentp

The other way would be to supply the name as a parameterp  precodevar myObject  function     function myObjectmyName         this.myName  myName           myObject.prototype.checkNameIsJames  functionname       return name  James           return myObject   var newObject  new myObjectJames codepre  pIn which case I can do all kinds of unit tests with different namesp  precodevar o  new myObjectJames var result  o.checkNameIsJameso.myName var result  o.checkNameIsJamesPeter codepre  pThis is a fairly contrived example, but if you imagined this as a much larger example with many objects functions and vairables, should I be aiming to use parameters as much as possible even when not technically necessary so that I can improve the coverage of my testing Or would that be considered uneeded complexity for the sake of completing unit testsp

For instance, perhaps the status is always returned in a timely fashion and doesnt wait for any delays in transferring the images from my server to Twilio, and so, under heavy loads, no URLs are assigned until after the status has already been delivered.p  ol liShould the above shown technique work If not...li liAre there any parameters provided in the callback status that would provide this information If not...li liWhats the best way to retrieve this information after the callbackli liIf the URL can only be reliably retrieved after the callback, is there a way in the original creation of the message to pass a parameter that would be returned so the server would know that a MediaUrl been specified for that message Obviously, the server could use the SID to fetch the message parameters from its local database, but that wouldnt be as efficient.li ol

Negative 259 pI have a WPF component which comprises a ListView that holds 4 columns.p  pEach column holds a custom component that contains 2 controls  one for display, and one for edit.p  p3 columns display plain text, and one contains a ComboBox.  The custom component should behave as follows.p  ol liThe XAML defines a DisplayControl and an EditControl, both of which are UIElement.li liWhen the custom component is added to the ListView, the component will display the UIElement held in the property DisplayControl. A click handler is bound to the DisplayControls MouseLeftButtonUp property.li liWhen the control is clicked on, the DisplayControl is removed, and the EditControl is shown. An event handler is bound to the EditControls LostFocus property.li liWhen the control uses focus, the EditControl is removed, and the DisplayControl is shown again. The DisplayControl updates to the value in the EditControl.li ol  pThis behaviour is fine when the EditControl is a ComboBox. Clicking on the relevant column swaps out the TextBlock for the ComboBox, and clicking outside of the ComboBox drops the focus and the TextBlock is displayed.p  pWhen clicking on a cell which uses a TextBox as the EditControl however, focus is retained when another item is clicked on. The ListView is set to a single selection mode, yet multiple text values can be selected at once, which in turn results in multiple text boxes on the view at any one time.p  pAs I understand it, this is because clicking on the control within the cell does not necessarily select the cell it is in. As a result, the single selection mode of the ListView has no effect.p  pIs it possible to either have p  ol liA click in the custom control forcibly drop the focus of other controls in the ListView, orli liCause a click on the custom control to select the cell it is sat on, thus causing the ListView to handle the focus being shifted to another controlli ol  pEdit Occasionally, clicking on a cell will cause the component to lose focus, but due to problems with the combo box behaviour, I have remove the event handling for lost focus. At this stage, Im looking for a way to select the ListView cell whenever the object contained in the cell is clicked on. If I can hook an event when a ListView cell loses focus, I can trigger the component switch back to Display mode at that point.p  pThe code for the custom controlp  ppublic partial class

Negative 259 pI am about to build a feature in our DDP server a hrefhttpsgithub.comcortexlangweb relnofollowhttpsgithub.comcortexlangweba that allows a user to subscribe for a window of historic values for a given document. A simple subscription for historical values could look likep  precodeconnection.subscribeMyCollection, historyfromlast0, tolast10 codepre  pThis will return the last 10 samples for each document in the codeMyCollectioncode collection in an array.

Negative 259 pI am writing an OS X documentbased application using cocoaswift. So far I have a model, which is managed by the codeNSDocumentcode subclass. Custom views are managed by custom view controllers, which update the views to keep them synchronised with the model.p  pThe modelcontrollerview flow of information is strightforward. I have the view controllers observing the document and, when the document changes, the view controllers do their job with the views. The issue is that, in this process, the models objects are obviously exposed to the view controllers, and therefore the view controllers could also modify the model if I wish or if I make a mistake.p  pId like the document to be the only one who has permission to modify the model objects. The view controllers should have readonly access to them. Is there a way to do this in Swiftp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 259 pI have a Django application for a website that were trying to post to Facebook. Most of the time after a new page is created and we try to post it, Facebook will either hang or come back with blank information for the page. The pages that were trying to post have OG tags so it should be able to process it, but it doesnt. p  pIve tried adding some code to force Graph to precache the page before we try to post it. The response I get back is a 500 error or a message saying the ogtype property is missing, and the debugger shows Response Code NA and The ogtype property is required, but not present  even though the property exists.p  pIf I force the debugger to fetch new scrape information it will and it will report the correct tags and the image for the page. At that point were able to post the page properly. However that doesnt always work either, sometimes itll come back and say it cant find the tags but then if I fetch it again itll get the tags. The serverside logs show that the Facebook bot connects and the page is always delivered. p  pIm not really a Django programmer so Im kind of stumbling through this.

Negative 259 pSo I am having an issue with my serial communication between Python and an Arduino Uno. I have Python sending the number 38 along with other numbers through serial communication by a bytearray to Arduino and then back to Python. p  pThe array I am sending isp  precode [230, 0, 0, 0, 38]  codepre  pAnd the array it is printing out when using print isp  precodebytearraybxe6x00x00x00amp codepre  pThe ampersand is there because there is a weird nuance in the printing of the bytearray that when the number is between a certain range sorry I cant remember the range it prints it out in ASCII rather then hexidecimal, so the array I am sending to Arduino should still have all of the information needed. p  pI am receiving the information in Arduino byp  precodechar values[5]     Serial.readbytesvalues, 5 codepre  pOnce arduino reveives the information, I use Serial.write to send it back to  Python, where I print them out to ensure I have received the correct information. This output received in Python isp  precodebxe6x00x00x00xf6  codepre  pwhere the 0xe6 is 230 correct and 0xf6 is 246 which is incorrect, it should be the hex value for 38 which is 0x26. p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions as to how to fix this Any suggestions or help would be appreciatedp  pEDIT  Found my problem, I accidentally had a  misplaced minus 0 because at one point I thought that I had to transform the information from ASCII to hex, but it turns out that I dont. Thanks for the helpp
Negative 259 pI am puzzled by the styling of TButtons that have DefaultTrue. The issue is that at least with some styles Luna, for example, the most recently focused button is highlighted orange, which is the same styling used for a default button. As a result, I am concerned that users might be confused as to which button is the default or will at least think it odd that two buttons are highlighted. This behavior can be seen in XE7 and according to a comment, also in XE8. Questionsp  ol liIs this considered a modern way relatively to unstyled VCL to present default buttonsli liIf this is not considered standard behavior I can work around it in my own dialogs by strategically enablingdisabling the default button, but I was wondering whether I missed some setting that controls the relation between default buttons and the mostrecently focused button. Is there a setting that controls this li ol

Negative 259 pI have been using Database First Entity Framework EDMX and SQL Server Data Tools Database Projects in combination very successfully  change the schema in the database and Update Model from Database to get them into the EDMX. I see though that Entity Framework 7 will be dropping the EDMX format and I am looking for a new process that will allow me to use Code First in Combination with Database Projects.p  pLots of my existing development and deployment processes rely on having a database project that contains the schema. This goes in source control is deployed along with the code and is used to update the production database complete with data migration using pre and post deployment scripts. I would be reluctant to drop it.p  pI would be keen to split one big EDMX into many smaller models as part of this work. This will mean multiple Code First models referencing the same database.p  pAssuming that I have an existing database and a database project to go with it  I am thinking that I would start by using the following wizard to create an initial set of entity and context classes  I would do this for each of the models.p  precodeAdd  New Item...  Visual C Items  Data  ADO.NET Entity Data Model  Code first from database codepre  pMy problem is  where do I go from there How do I handle schema changes As long as I can get the database schema updated, I can use a schema compare operation to get the changes into the project.p  pThese are the options that I am considering.p  ol liMake changes in the database and use the wizard from above to regenerate. I guess that I would need to keep any modifications to the entity andor context classes in partial classes so that they do not get overwritten. Automating this with a list of tables etc to include would be handy. Powershell or T4 Templates maybe a hrefhttpsgithub.comaeslinger0sqlsharpener relnofollowSqlSharpenera suggested by Keith in comments looks like it might help here. I would also look at a hrefhttpscoding.abel.nu201203preventefmigrationsfromcreatingorchangingthedatabase relnofollowdisabling all but the checks for database existence and schema compatibilitya here, as suggested by Steve Green in the comments.li liMake changes in code and use migrations to get these changes applied to the database. From what I understand, not having models map cleanly to database schemas mine dont might pose problems. I also see some complaints on the net that migrations do not cover all database object types  this was also my experience when I played around with Code First a while back  unique constraints I think were not covered. Has this improved in Entity Framework 7li liMake changes in the database and then use migrations as a kind of comparison between code and the database. See what the differences are and adjust the code to suit. Keep going until there are no differences.li liMake changes manually in both code and the database. Obviously, this is not very appealing.li ol  pWhich of these would be best Is there anything that I would need to know before trying to implement it Are there any other, better optionsp
Negative 259 pI have an AngularJS app that makes a call to an API and returns a bunch of data that users can then filter by tags for greater granularity in the results. Each time a tag is clicked to filter the data, the app makes a new codehttp.getcode call, and the URL is modified with the appropriate query parameters so that the user can save the permalink and come back to any particular data set. p  pIm trying to give the app proper history handling with codewindow.history.pushStatecode, and passing the relevant query parameters for each history object as state data. Im using codewindow.onpopstatecode to detect when the backforward buttons are clicked, and using that to make the new codehttp.getcode call with the relevant state data from the history. p  pFor some reason, the codehttp.getcode function only fires on every emsecondem codepopstatecode, and then it makes two calls. Its almost as if theres some caching going on, but I havent been able to find the culprit. This behaviour persists in both directions, backwards and forwards, and is consistently every second event. Ive verified that codewindow.history.lengthcode is only incremented by 1 for every tag addedremoved, that the state data is being successfully sent, that new search queries are being correctly assembled, and that the request path is correct. Its just not firing.

Negative 259 pIts been a week since I am trying to access me project files through wamp and Im not being able.p  pI returned to default configuration, becaus i wasnt being able to access to localhost either.p  pthis it my httpd.confp  precode  This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the  configuration directives that give the server its instructions.  See ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4gt for detailed information.  In particular, see   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4moddirectives.htmlgt  for a discussion of each configuration directive.   Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding  what they do.  Theyre here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure  consult the online docs. You have been warned.     Configuration and logfile names If the filenames you specify for many  of the servers control files begin with  or drive for Win32, the  server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do not begin  with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so logsaccesslog  with ServerRoot set to usrlocalapache2 will be interpreted by the  server as usrlocalapache2logsaccesslog, whereas logsaccesslog   will be interpreted as logsaccesslog.   NOTE Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes  instead of backslashes e.g., capache instead of capache.  If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located  will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply  an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion. ServerSignature On ServerTokens Full    ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.   Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point  ServerRoot at a nonlocal disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the  Mutex directive, if filebased mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the  same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at  least PidFile.  ServerRoot cwampbinapacheapache2.4.9  Define APACHE24 Apache2.4    Mutex Allows you to set the mutex mechanism and mutex file directory  for individual mutexes, or change the global defaults   Uncomment and change the directory if mutexes are filebased and the default  mutex file directory is not on a local disk or is not appropriate for some  other reason.   Mutex defaultlogs    Listen Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses andor  ports, instead of the default. See also the ltVirtualHostgt  directive.   Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to   prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.

User daemon Group daemon  ltIfModulegt   Main server configuration   The directives in this section set up the values used by the main  server, which responds to any requests that arent handled by a  ltVirtualHostgt definition.  These values also provide defaults for  any ltVirtualHostgt containers you may define later in the file.   All of these directives may appear inside ltVirtualHostgt containers,  in which case these default settings will be overridden for the  virtual host being defined.     ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be  emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such  as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com  ServerAdmin adminexample.com    ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.  This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify  it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.   If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.  ServerName localhost80  HostnameLookups Off    DocumentRoot The directory out of which you will serve your  documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but  symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.  DocumentRoot cwampwww    Each directory to which Apache has access can be configured with respect  to which services and features are allowed andor disabled in that  directory and its subdirectories.    First, we configure the default to be a very restrictive set of   features.    ltDirectory gt     AllowOverride none     Require all denied ltDirectorygt    Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow  particular features to be enabled  so if somethings not working as  you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it  below.   ltDirectory cwampwwwgt           Possible values for the Options directive are None, All,      or any combination of        Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews           Note that MultiViews must be named explicitly  Options All      doesnt give it to you.           The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see      httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4modcore.htmloptions      for more information.          Options Indexes FollowSymLinks            AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.      It can be All, None, or any combination of the keywords        AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit          AllowOverride all            Controls who can get stuff from this server.          onlineoffline tag  dont remove     Require local ltDirectorygt    DirectoryIndex sets the file that Apache will serve if a directory  is requested.  ltIfModule dirmodulegt     DirectoryIndex index.php index.php3 index.html index.htm ltIfModulegt    The following lines prevent .htaccess and .htpasswd files from being   viewed by Web clients.   ltFiles .htgt     Require all denied ltFilesgt    ErrorLog The location of the error log file.  If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a ltVirtualHostgt  container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be  logged here.  If you do define an error logfile for a ltVirtualHostgt  container, that hosts errors will be logged there and not here.  ErrorLog logserror.log ErrorLog cwamplogsapacheerror.log    LogLevel Control the number of messages logged to the errorlog.  Possible values include debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,  alert, emerg.  LogLevel warn  ltIfModule logconfigmodulegt           The following directives define some format nicknames for use with      a CustomLog directive see below.          LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti combined     LogFormat h l u t r gts b common      ltIfModule logiomodulegt        You need to enable modlogio.c to use I and O       LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti I O combinedio     ltIfModulegt            The location and format of the access logfile Common Logfile Format.      If you do not define any access logfiles within a ltVirtualHostgt      container, they will be logged here.  Contrariwise, if you do      define perltVirtualHostgt access logfiles, transactions will be      logged therein and not in this file.          CustomLog cwamplogsaccess.log common            If you prefer a logfile with access, agent, and referer information      Combined Logfile Format you can use the following directive.          CustomLog logsaccess.log combined ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule aliasmodulegt           Redirect Allows you to tell clients about documents that used to       exist in your servers namespace, but do not anymore. The client       will make a new request for the document at its new location.      Example      Redirect permanent foo httpwww.example.combar            Alias Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to      access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.      Example      Alias webpath fullfilesystempath           If you include a trailing  on webpath then the server will      require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely      need to provide a ltDirectorygt section to allow access to      the filesystem path.            ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.       ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that      documents in the target directory are treated as applications and      run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the      client.  The same rules about trailing  apply to ScriptAlias      directives as to Alias.          ScriptAlias cgibin cwampbinapacheapache2.4.9cgibin  ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule cgidmodulegt           ScriptSock On threaded servers, designate the path to the UNIX      socket used to communicate with the CGI daemon of modcgid.

TypesConfig confmime.types            AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration      file specified in TypesConfig for specific file types.          AddType applicationxgzip .tgz           AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers uncompress      information on the fly. Note Not all browsers support this.          AddEncoding xcompress .Z     AddEncoding xgzip .gz .tgz           If the AddEncoding directives above are commentedout, then you      probably should define those extensions to indicate media types          AddType applicationxcompress .Z     AddType applicationxgzip .gz .tgz     AddType applicationxhttpdphp .php     AddType applicationxhttpdphp .php3            AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to handlers      actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server      or added with the Action directive see below           To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories      You will also need to add ExecCGI to the Options directive.          AddHandler cgiscript .cgi       For type maps negotiated resources     AddHandler typemap var            Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.           To parse .shtml files for serverside includes SSI      You will also need to add Includes to the Options directive.          AddType texthtml .shtml     AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml ltIfModulegt    The modmimemagic module allows the server to use various hints from the  contents of the file itself to determine its type.  The MIMEMagicFile  directive tells the module where the hint definitions are located.

Default setting is to accept 200 Ranges. MaxRanges unlimited    EnableMMAP and EnableSendfile On systems that support it,   memorymapping or the sendfile syscall may be used to deliver  files.  This usually improves server performance, but must  be turned off when serving from networkedmounted   filesystems or if support for these functions is otherwise  broken on your system.  Defaults EnableMMAP On, EnableSendfile Off  EnableMMAP off EnableSendfile off   AcceptFilter On Windows, none uses accept rather than AcceptEx and  will not recycle sockets between connections. This is useful for network  adapters with broken driver support, as well as some virtual network  providers such as vpn drivers, or spam, virus or spyware filters. AcceptFilter http none AcceptFilter https none   Supplemental configuration   The configuration files in the confextra directory can be   included to add extra features or to modify the default configuration of   the server, or you may simply copy their contents here and change as   necessary.

Most configurations  use only namebased virtual hosts so the server doesnt need to worry about  IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.   Please see the documentation at   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4vhostsgt  for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.   You may use the command line option S to verify your virtual host  configuration.    VirtualHost example  Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
