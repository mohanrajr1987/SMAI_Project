Positive 3664 pDescription of my situationp  pCurrently I am trying to generate a WSDL file.  This WSDL should be fully valid and represent the documentliteral wrapped style.  Moreover this WSDL should link to external xsd files which are contained in a specific FOLDER located in the same place as WSDL. As an additional info I can say that In this FOLDER have been located many subfolders and each of them contain 3 different XSDs.  I suspect, that in the Types section is only required to include the master file and the other two will be linked automatically.p  pProblemQuestionp  pAlways when I try to open file with i.e. XMLSPY I gain an error communicate which told me that the file have a problems with namespaces, with including of  the XSD files and also that elements that I put to the WSDLparts of the messages which should be a references to the mentioned earlier XSDs which  are not defined in the wsdl.p  pI am not proffesional in that area so  I would like to kindly ask you for help in the following areasp  p1.If I include every section needed to the WSDL file creation and its proper execution and validationp  p2.Is my file in the the documentliteral wrapped styleOr what sholud I changep  p3.How to include external xsd to the WSDL parts of communicate. I want to achieve a wsdl document which after import to i.e. xml spy would import my xsd from specific folder.p  p4.What are the role of namespaces and How to define it properlyp  pI enclose my WSDL

Positive 3664 pIm building a class which uses Winsock2 functions. The problem I have is that the linker cant resolve winsock functions bind, closesocket, etc because I wrapped the class inside a namespace. If I try to remove the namespace wrapper then it works, but then I cant code properly my class inside a namespace.p  pMy question is Is there a namespace that I can use to prefix winsock API functions in order to work inside a namespacep  h2See the example.h2  h2In Header fileh2  precodenamespace MyNamespace    class Server        ...

Positive 3664 pI started getting lookup errors recently with a nontrivially sized C project compiled with Clang. I assumed unclosed namespace, if or class definition, but found none. Ive managed to break it down to the following codep  precodenamespace A    class foo    namespace B    class bar  public Afoo   codepre  pThe definition of bar fails to find Afoo, but does suggest Afoo. Now the really strange thing is, if I set the name of namespace B to something specific and exists elsewhere Testing, in this case, it fails. Anything else, and it compiles fine. So my question is how can a namespace name affect lookup in another namespace in such a wayp  pThanksp  pEdit Seems to be some confusion over the question so Ill clarify. This example is all that is needed to exhibit the error, however the problem is a bunch of code is compiled before this which is causing some sort of side effects. The question is, what code compiled beforehand could cause the example above to fail What could be done inside a namespace such that future uses of that namespace have difficultly being found Im personally not aware of any code that could cause such a side effect in future uses of a namespace.p  pNote I am unable to find the code that is causing the prior side effect. If I could I probably wouldnt be asking here for deeper internal knowledge of C compilation and namespaces.p

Negative 3664 pI need to deserialize some JavaScript object represented in JSON to an appropriate C class.

Negative 3664 pThis is actually a solved problem, but its so esoteric I thought Id share it for other users.p  pAlso perhaps others might suggest reasonsp  pAnyway, Im working on a mixed mode .NET application written in managed C, but with heavy links into existing native libraries.p  pThe problem was, unhandled managed exceptions ended up as Win32 Access Violations. What I mean by this is that instead of showing the nice .NET dialog one gets with an unhandled managed exception, instead I would get the older style Unhandled win32 exception occurred in... message.p  pHeres the interesting thing if I start the app in the debugger, then the thrown managed exception gets correctly picked up. i.e., the debugger shows me the line. p  pHowever, when executing normally, it would turn into this Access Violation. Attaching the debugger at that point would produce little useful information it wouldnt even show a sensible stack trace.p  pSo, to me it suggests that something is happening in native code just before the unhandled managed exception reaches the exception handler.p  pSo anyway, I managed to solve the issue by comparing my project to a clean new C managed project generated by Visual Studio 2008.p  pThe fix was to do the followingp  ol lipChange the SUBSYSTEM flag Project propertiesLinkerSystemSubSystem strongfromstrong SUBSYSTEMWINDOWS strongtostrong Not Setpli lipSwitched from using old style WinMain to using the new style main.pli ol  pi.e. it used to be p  precode  int APIENTRY tWinMainHINSTANCE hInstance,                        HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,                        LPTSTR    lpCmdLine,                        int       nCmdShow codepre  pAnd it is nowp  precodeint mainarrayltSystemString gt args codepre  p[Why am I using this weird tWinMain This was what got generated by the Visual Studio .NET IDE many years ago when you create a sample mixed mode Windows app. Its always worked fine until now so I never bothered changing it. tWinMain is just a macro to WinMain]p  pI made this change and the problem disappears. Unhandled .NET exceptions now get properly trapped so I can now actually debug them.p  pI also made the inverse change to the clean sample C app and proved that it was the cause.p  pSo, really my questions is, what the heck is going onp  pWas it just that I was using the old style WinMain instead of the new mainarray p  pShould I maybe report this to Microsoft will anyone care  p

nested ListBox p  pI will add a command which will store selected Item to Database once double clicked. SubItems will be stored as child record  based on its IsSelected value.p  p2 Is there a way to make SubItems property of  c class  observable . I would not want to change by adding Observable to the object as it will be in another assembly and may be used by other applications.p  pstrongEdit 1strong Found somewhat helpful question p  blockquote   pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1200950wpfdatabindingtocompositeclasspatternsWPF Databinding to composite class patternsap blockquote  pBut again for this I will have to inherit from INotifyPropertyChanged. p  pstrongEdit 2strong  Let me see if I can explain  better  ListBox1 is Single select Mode and parent amp ListBox 2 is multiselect. ListBox1 is binded item source to property which returns observablecollection. ListBox2 is binded to a Property in Item Class Item.SubItems  which returns  IList. Item Class has IsSelected Property.I want to be able to select subitems  which should set IsSelected Property  for the subItems to true.   Knowing that there is no INotifyPropertyChanged inheritance in Item Class how can I achieve this. I assume that unless subitems come under  some observable collection any changes will not be notified back to source. Using the selectedData property I can update the subitems by finding parent Item but then to update the  view I will have to firePropertChanged for items which involves all items and subitems. I want only subitems change to be notified back by binding mechanism.  Sorry if I am still not clear.p  pEdit 3p  pI Guess there is no way but to implement INotifyPropertyChanged on Item class. Other way would be to implemnt a viewmodel which is very specific to needs of view but this will add up lot of code.p

Negative 3664 pI am weighing my options for integer primary keys that can be used in multi master replication. Im pretty much sold on using integer keys instead of GUIDsp  pThe best I can come up with is having the most significant data first and having the server number last eg. invoice 1 on server 1  101 invoice 1 on server 2  102 where the non serverno part invoiceno comes from a db number generatorp  palgorithmically genidINVOICENOGEN, 1  100  serverno and you can get the server number by both looking at the value and mathematically.p  pWhich leaves room for 99 servers while still being short and readable and wont collide. Using that scheme and normal integer size column would make the max rows 21 474 836 or if bigint is used many billions.p  pfor instance the invoice table keys would look like thisp  precodeServer 1     101 201 301 401  Server 2     102 202 302 402 codepre  pstrongSo my question is any critiques or flaws I have overlookedstrongp  pThe database is Firebird.p

The form submits the values to a PHP file which validates the values with the database and redirects to another page if the login is successful.p  pThe problem with this approach is that, if AJAX is not involved, it refreshes the page even if the login is unsuccessful.p  pI would like to remove the form tag altogether, merge the PHP code into the same file as the HTML. For this I attempted to add an codeonclickcode event to the input boxes. But since form tag was removed, something awkward happened.

Negative 3664 pI am new to the asp.net world but not new to .net and I have been playing around with various things to see how I want to architect a web application I am developing.  In my playing around I have decided I did not want to use asp.nets controls, as I have done enough php and ruby on rails to be decently familiar with regular HTML, and a decent amount of javascript.p  pI see a lot of comparisons between asp.net webforms and asp.net MVC, however when ti comes down to it I am not seeing that much of a difference and Ill admit that its probably me missing the differences rather than them not being there.  I already have coded my asp.net application using a MVC type of architecture aspx has the view, aspx.cs has the controller code, and models are separate classes in the appcode directory.p  pIf I do not intend to use asp.net controls and just intend to use pure html and javascript, what are the advantages of using the MVC framework  As of right now, the only one that I am seeing is routing, and Im sure if I look more I can find easy ways to do custom routing without using the whole MVC framework.p  pAnyways, if anyone could go into details of asp.net webforms minus the asp controls versus mvc framework, I would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 3664 pIs there an easy or at least elegant way to prevent duplicate entries in polymorphic hasmany through associationsp  pIve got two models, stories and links that can be tagged. Im making a conscious decision to not use a plugin here. I want to actually understand everything thats going on and not be dependent on someone elses code that I dont fully grasp.p  pTo see what my question is getting at, if I run the following in the console assuming the story and tag objects exist in the database alreadyp  precodes  Story.findbyid1  t  Tag.findbyid1  s.tags ltlt t  s.tags ltlt t codepre  pMy taggings join table will have two entries added to it, each with the same exact data tagid  1, taggableid  1, taggabletype  Story. That just doesnt seem very proper to me. So in an attempt to prevent this from happening I added the following to my Tagging modelp  precodebeforevalidation validateuniqueness  def validateuniqueness     taggings  Tagging.findall, conditions gt  tagid gt self.tagid, taggableid gt self.taggableid, taggabletype gt self.taggabletype       if taggings.empty         return false     end      return true end codepre  pAnd it works almost as intended, but if I attempt to add a duplicate tag to a story or link I get an ActiveRecordRecordInvalid Validation failed exception. It seems that when you add an association to a list it calls the save rather than save sans  method which raises exceptions if something goes wrong rather than just returning false. That isnt quite what I want to happen. I suppose I can surround any attempts to add new tags with a trycatch but that goes against the idea that you shouldnt expect your exceptions and this is something I fully expect to happen.p  pIs there a better way of doing this that wont raise exceptions when all I want to do is just silently not save the object to the database because a duplicate existsp

For the purpose of this homework, Integers will be used as Keys.p  pSince no other restriction or information about that is given, I first thought of just asuming that Key will always be an Integer. However, that makes the generic Key superfluous, and I dont think thats what the teachers expect. So, I think that the best solution involves forcing that whatever that is passed as Key implements a Comparator, or something like that Ive really never worked with Comparator, just guessing, and then using that comparator to compare the Keys instead of using the ,lt, and  operators. However, I have no idea on how to do it. Any hintsp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 3664 pGood morningp  pYesterday I watched Tekpubs amazing video a hrefhttptekpub.comviewconcepts1Dependency Injection and Inversion of Controla and it blew my mind.

Negative 3664 pI have a client that has a managed C DLL library that needs to be able to run on Unix. There arent a lot of references to .NET specific code in there except for the files that receive the inputs from an external processthread. The project is currently compiled on Visual Studio.NET 2010. What are some steps to follow in order to make this happen Obviously, I will need to create makefiles on the Unix side for example. Another thing I will need to do is to replace classes that are using .NET properties to use getterssetters is this the best way to go. Their front end GUI is currently an ExcelVisual Basic application that calls this DLL library to perform calculations on a set of data. However, they are going to rewrite the frontend as well not sure what technology they are going to use. Im assuming that another I will need to do is replace CLI types in the code with native types. Am I correct in my assumptions so far What other bigger things will need to be done Thanksp

Go to a hrefhttpccl.northwestern.edunetlogomodelsGiantComponenthttpccl.northwestern.edunetlogomodelsGiantComponenta and click Run in browser requires Java.  Click Setup then click Go.  You can see the graph evolve.  If we do this in Mathematica, then each of the successive graphs will look completely different, and it will be difficult to see that it is the same graph that is evolving.  In several applications its quite useful to be able to visualize small changes to the graph as such.  But if many successive changes are done, then recomputing the layout is a must, simply fading or highlighting edges is not sufficient.  Again, this is just an example Im not trying to use Mathematica to animate a graph, or to visualize the emergence of the giant component.p

Negative 3664 pIm dealing with a byte array that comprises a text message, but some of the characters in the message are control characters i.e. less than 0x20 and I want to replace them with sequences of characters that are human readable when decoded into ASCII for instance code0x0Fcode would display code[TAB]code instead of actually being a tab character. So as I see it, I have three optionsp  ol liDecode the whole thing into an ASCII string, then use codeString.Replacecode to swap out what I want. The problem with this is that the characters seem to just be decoded as the unprintable box character or question marks, thus losing their actual byte values.li liIterate through the byte array looking for any of my control characters and performing an array insert operation make new larger array, copy existing pieces in, write new pieces.li liUse codeArray.ToListltbytegtcode to convert the byte array to a codeListcode, then use codeIEnumerable.SelectManycode to transform the control characters into sequences of readable characters which codeSelectManycode will then flatten back out for me.li ol  pSo the question is, which is the best option in terms of efficiency I dont really have a good feel for the performance implications of the codeIEnumerablecode lambda operations.

Negative 3664 pI want to test my request builder in unit tests. But I have problem when I want to test my method that makes POST request.I want to test its content in request stream. But the problem is that that I cannot read this stream in my test so I cannot test whether my data is written in right way inside request. I have this problem because when I close stream after writing in it in my Request builder class. I cannot open it for reading because after calling the Close method on stream it becomes unreadable. So, is there a way to read a stream after calling Close methodp  pIf this isnt possible, how would you solve this problemp

At the moment all the tools I want to use are hardcoded into the library. For instance these tools validate or build the scaffold. Id like to split these tools out into their own gems, make it more modular, and to allow third parties to write their own commands.p  pThe ideal case would be that I run gem install scaffoldervalidate and this gembundled command would then be available as part of scaffolder. I know a couple of libraries make it easy to build a commandline interface thor, commander, gli, .... However I dont think any of them cater for this type of functionality.p  pMy question is how can I use a gem structure to create a module structure for installing these commands Specifically how can the installed commands be autodetected and loaded With some prefix in the gem name scaffolder then searching rubygems How could I test this with cucumberp

Negative 3664 pI am new to device driver programming. Ive followed the available tutorials on the web which has provided helpful information to get started. However now I have embarked on a new project where the exclusive goal is to search for functions which have been hooked by malware or keyloggers. So I think I have sorted out what I need to accomplish this though I still need to be able to locate the load address of the system dlls i.e. kernel32.dll, user32.dll and the like that are already loaded in memory. I need the load address so that I can parse their PE to get to the export and import sections. Furthermore adding the load address to the file size will give me a address range to cross reference the addresses of the export functions no  Cross referencing the the IMPORT address will be a little more involved but it can be done according to my estimates. I thought that building a kernel mode driver would be the right way to go since accessing memory outside the kernel drivers address range would not be an issue for the driver as opposed to a user mode app. How else will I be able to access the addresses located in the EAT and IAT of the target dll  I know there exist a user mode API that can provide the load address mainly being GetModuleHandle but I would like to find the equivalent in kernel mode. I could write a user mode application that could relay this information to the driver but prefer that this all be done in kernel mode if possible. Any suggestions or comments would be most welcome.p  pThanks in advancep  pVictorp  pp.s This post has been edited for more clarity. Hopefully it will make it more clear as what I am trying to accomplish.p

Negative 3664 pCurrently I am exploring a hrefhttpquartzscheduler.org relnofollowQuartza scheduler for one of our projects. While I am still in process of exploring it, I have a few doubts.p  pEarlier I was working with one of Javabased ecommerce platforms where they have implemented Quartz scheduler in a very good way. Defining a new task requires the following steps.p  ol liLog in to the GUI.li liClick on new button, and it will open a page.li liEnter the unique codeJobcode name and the method name that we want to call.li liAny parameters which we want to pass if methods need them, only primitives are allowed.li liProvide trigger details Time, Day, Month any possible combinations.li liHit the save button and we are ready to go.li ol  pNow this prompted a few question, since in Quartz we have to create a job class that should implement codeJobcode interface and should implement its codeexecuteJobExecutionContext contextcode method, which will perform the work. I am wondering how that API on the platform was doing all this, as I have never created a class which has to implement the codeJobcode interface.p  pFor example, if i want to create a codeOrderExportcode function, all I did is created a class namely codeOrderExportcode  with a method say codeexportcode. Then in the UI for scheduler, I just filled the textboxes with job name any unique name, class name e.g. codeOrderExportcode, method name e.g. codeexportcode and triggering details.p  pCan any one suggestguide me how they have achieved thisp

Negative 3664 pI am trying to parse data from commoncrawl.org using hadoop streaming. I set up a local hadoop to test my code, and have a simple Ruby mapper which uses a streaming ARCfile reader. When I invoke my code myself likep  precodecat 126287624425318.arc.gz  mapper.rb  reducer.rb codepre  pIt works as expected.p  pIt seems that hadoop automatically sees that the file has a .gz extension and decompresses it before handing it to a mapper  however while doing so it converts rn linebreaks in the stream to n. Since ARC relies on a record length in the header line, the change breaks the parser because the data length has changed.p  pTo double check, I changed my mapper to expect uncompressed data, and didp  precodecat 126287624425318.arc.gz  zcat  mapper.rb  reducer.rb codepre  pAnd it works.p  pI dont mind hadoop automatically decompressing although I can quite happily deal with streaming .gz files, but if it does I need it to decompress in binary without doing any linebreak conversion or similar. I believe that the default behaviour is to feed decompressed files to one mapper per file, which is perfect.p  pHow can I either ask it not to decompress .gz renaming the files is not an option or make it decompress properly I would prefer not to use a special InputFormat class which I have to ship in a jar, if at all possible.p  pAll of this will eventually run on AWS ElasticMapReduce.p

Negative 3664 pI have implemented an IDispatch interface in C.

When I take the cleanup code out, the code works fine but will fail when the program using the code exits I dont have debug info from the calling app but its likely to be the wrapped interface hasnt been disposed.

Negative 3664 pIm using Visual Studio 2010, InstallShield LE on a solution with about 10 total projects.p  pIve selected the main GUIs primary project output for the files portion, installed to a subdirectory of Program Files, pretty standard.p  pI built the installer a few weeks ago and installed it on my test machine, everything was working fine.  Since then, Ive made changes to each project in the solution. Today, I incremented my assembly version and rebuilt my setup project to continue testing.p  pAfter installation, in the program files installation directory, I noticed that one of my projects assemblies still lists the previous version, 1.0.0.0, and the file date is over a month old.  The other assemblies in the directory show the current versions and current modified date.p  pIve tried deleting every bin and obj folder in my solution directory and the installer project folder as well.  I reinstalled but the problem remains.p  pI searched google, but as the problem is odd, a good search phrase has been elusive.p  pObviously, I need the most current version of my assemblies to be included in the installer msi.p  pThanks for any help or suggestionsp

Negative 3664 pIve used a a few service references in vb.netvs 2010, but this was the first one that both required a certificate and a custom soap header. I was given a WSDL and request xml which I tested successfully in soapUI 3.5. After creating a service reference in vb.net I could not figure out how to add a custom soap header. p  pI saw many examples that implement codeIClientMessageInspectorcode, but could not get any of them to work for one reason or another. Most had to do with my lack of understanding of the Implements keyword, but there was also an issue with endpoint behaviors. I already use an endpoint behavior for the certificate and could not get two endpoint behaviors to work on a single endpoint.p  pI switched to HttpWebRequest, but cant get it to work either. The code runs, but I get a similar error from the server. The error is codeRemote server returned an error500 Internal Server Error.code I used Fiddler to see the actual request and response, and the response is from their data power server is, codeTID247456978.Catastrophic Error.

I agree because I can get a valid response using soapUI.p  pSo the question is, what am I doing wrong. Does the code below even look right.

Negative 3664 pI have a table view set up with a search bar. Everything works great when I type text into the search bar, the results update in the table view based on my search text. The problem Im having is in determining what the ID of the table cell is to pass that along when Im going to my detail view. To clarify the cells in the table view are usually generated from a SQLite3 database and ordered by their name. So if I have 4 cells Cabernet Cortis, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Ruby Cabernet, their IDs are normally 78, 79, 80, 378. However when I search cabernet, and these four items come up, the indexPath.row is 1, 2, 3, 4 instead of 78, 79, 80, 378 so its taking me to the wrong grape in the detail view which are the first four grapes in alpha order as entered into my DB.p  pHere is some code to help clear things up.

When you click the Enter button, the Start screen slides away. p  pThe Main DIV is set to a zindex of 50. p  pThe problem is that when the Start screen slides away, you can read everything within the Main DIV, but can not necessarily click the links. You can see this in effect at the end of the 3rd paragraph. If you scroll the mouse over the link, the left side will not allow you to click it, but the right side does. p  pNow, if I change the zindex of the Main DIV to be higher than that of the Start Screen, all links are accessible, but the Start screen slides up and down behind the Main DIV, which is not useful. p  pI am at a loss. I do not know why when the Start screen slides out of view, why it prevents the links from working. I am sure I am missing something obvious and I appreciate any advise from an extra pair of eyes.

Negative 3664 pIm new to HTML5CanvasGame programming, but have been tinkering around with it after reading a couple of books. I THINK I have a fairly good idea of how things work out. This question asks several smaller questions, but in general is basically a structural approach question. Im not expecting verbose responses, but hopefully small pointers here and there  Here is a link to a nonscrolling, and currently rather boring Super Mario World. p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netCrusader12m6ur39Super Mario World Testap  pstrongNOTE Controls are LeftRight and Spacebar to jump. This is only setup for Firefox right now as Im just learning.strongp  hr  h2Did I Do Something Wrong at This Pointh2  pCurrently Ive just focused on how Mario runs and jumps, and think that Ive gotten it down fairly okay. The coin box doesnt do anything and the background is just an image loaded in for looks. Heres my approach, please let me know if there is anything entirely wrong with thisp  ul liAllows Mario to jump by enacting on 2 Y velocities Gravity and Jump variablesli liAllows Mario to run by enacting on 1 velocity Left or Right Friction  Accelerationli liSprites are used and positioned according to keypresskeydownli liIm not sure if this is right, but Im using a constructor function to build an object, then inside the main animation loop Im calling the prototype.draw function for that object to update all variables and redraw the object.li liIm clearing the entire canvas each Frameli liShould I be splitting this into more than just a draw function, like Mario.moveli liIve setup a GroundLevel and a JumpLevel variable to create 2 planes of gameplay. The JumpLevel is setup to allow for controlling how high Mario can jump on the fly. The 2 places would allow for the ground to rise like a hill  keeping the point at which Gravity overrules Marios jumping force at the same distance from the ground.li liFor clarity sake, everything is separated into different JS files, but would obviously consolidate.li ul  hr  h2Moving Forwardh2  pNow that Ive finished setting up how Mario moves around I think there are a couple other minor things I might do like mushroom updown and shooting fireballs. I think I can figure that out, but Im really lost when it comes to visualizing the following and how HTML5Canvas can handle this easilyp  ul lipScrolling background Ive tried setting up Ground Tiles and using Screen Wrapping, but that seems to cause a lot of uneven issues since I was moving the tiles in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, since Im trying to account for acceleration, this threw off the count and was causing gaps in the ground. I ditched this idea. Would a DIV beneath the canvas with a large background image be the best solutionpli lipEnemies Would I create enemies the same way and run a loop for collision detection on every enemy during each framepli lipBackground Boxes Im trying to allow Mario to stand on the boxes in the background, but am unsure how to approach this. I currently have boundaries setup for Mario to stay on the canvas, do I continue to expand these conditions to setup different boundaries based on the boxes I can see that having several boxes on the screen and doing it this way would get kind of crazy, especially if I would be doing the same hit testing for enemies I know Im missing something here....pli lipLevel Movement This is somewhat related. When the Right key is pressed, basically everything in the level needs to move to the left. Would I need to track out all positions of everything that could touch Mario boxes for him to stand on and enemies for him to collide with during every animation frame This seems like it would get kind of inefficient pli ul  pThanks to all Ill keep this updated with resultssolutions p

Negative 3664 pIm looking for a Java scheduling framework which is not timerdriven or any kind of cronstyle scheduler like Quartz and others. There are awfully many questions and answers here that address timerdriven schedulers, but such a scheduler wouldnt solve my problem. p  pThe problem I have is that I have several threads where each takes messages from a blocking queue assigned to it. When a blocking queue is empty the thread that reads from it is blocked and cannot be assigned to some other thread. This way my system can run into some starvation problem. Because of this JDK5 thread pools wont fit in as they can only assign idle threads that are not blocked to another queue that needs to be served. p  pI found hawt dispatch on the Internet which is very much what I need, but its advanced features like futures, that would make things much more comfortable for me, are only available when using the Scala API. Anybody knows some Java framework similar to hawt dispatch Any hint much appreaciated.p  pRegards, Oliverp

Negative 3664 pI have an application which is based on animations. After hours of trying and searching the most effective animation processor which would have low delay and the best memory management I found out the amazing PNGAnimator httpwww.modejong.comiPhone. Funny thing is that I am actually using JPEGs due to size, but that is not the problem.p  pThe problem is that the class itself is a subclass of UIViewController and when I add it to my rootViewController the new  view controller overlaps it  so all the interface elements buttons... are hidden under it. p  pThat is why I would like to somehow convert the code to be a subclass of UIView. So I can add the buttons over it I tried converting the code myself, however the application would crash on an animation call. Could you please tell me what should I change in the code to so it will act as an UIViewp  pFor example, I tried to change it in .h file to UIView and then in .m file, changing the references self.view to just self.

Negative 3664 pThe watermark needs to be encoded by making pixels from the image even where the corresponding watermark pixel is black and odd where the corresponding watermark pixel is white. p  pFunction codeaddwatermarkcode must take two parameters, an image file name, e.g., codeStoryBridge.bmpcode, and a watermark file name, e.g., codedogwatermark.bmpcode, and it must create a new image file, e.g., codeStoryBridgeX.bmpcode, with the watermark invisibly hidden in the image.p  pFunction coderevealwatermarkcode accepts the name of a watermarked image file, e.g., codeBryceCanyonX.bmpcode, and creates a new image file, e.g., codeBryceCanyonXO.bmpcode, that reveals the hidden watermark.

I just dont know how to link them all together. p  pAnd I have a MySQL database with the building,floor,and room number.p  pThanks in advance everybody. I appreciate your effort.p

Negative 3664 pI am stumped here.  I have struggled to find any viable answer to my question both here and within NSubstitutes documentation.p  pIm trying to unit test a service method where, after an object is added to the repository, I access the navigation properties of that object to do other work.

Negative 3664 pWe have a WPF application that has a ListBox with a VirtualizingStackPanel with caching. Not because it has massively many elements typically less than 20 but perhaps up to 100 or more in extreme cases but because elements take time to generate. The elements are in fact UIElement objects. So the application dynamically needs to generate UIElements.p  pThe problem is that even though the virtualization appears to work, the application is still slow to become responsive, and this is in a proof of concept solution with minimal noise.p  pSo we figured that since the main problem is that we generate complex UIElement objects dynamically, we need to do that in parallel, i.e. offthread. But we get an error that the code needs to be run on a STA threadp  blockquote   pThe calling thread must be STA, because many UI components require this.p blockquote  pDoes this mean that we cannot generate UI UIElement objects on thread other than the WPF main UI threadp  pHeres a relevant code fragment from our proof of concept solutionp  precodepublic class Person  ObservableBase       ...

Negative 3664 h2Contexth2  pIn an interactive prototyping development on the notebook connected to a cluster, I would like to define a class that is both available in the client codemaincode session and interactively update on the cluster engine nodes to be able to move instances of that class around by passing such instances a argument to a LoadBalanced view. The following demonstrates the typical user sessionp  pFirst setup the parallel clustering environmentp  precodegtgtgt from IPython.parallel import Client gtgtgt rc  Client gtgtgt lview  rc.loadbalancedview gtgtgt rc[] ltDirectView [0, 1, 2]gt codepre  pIn a notebook cell lets define the code snippet of the component we are interactively editing p  precodegtgtgt class MyClassobject ...     def initself, parameter ...         self.parameter  parameter ... ...     def updatesomethingself, somedata ...          do something smart here with somedata amp internal state ... ...     def computesomethingself, otherdata ...          do something smart here with other data amp internal state ...         return something ... codepre  pIn the next cell, lets create a script that builds instances of this class and then use the load balanced view of the cluster environment to evaluate our component on a wide range of input parametersp  precodegtgtgt def processobj, somedata, otherdata ...     obj.updatesomethingsomedata ...     return obj.computesomethingotherdata ... gtgtgt tasks  [] gtgtgt someinstances  [MyClassi for i in range10] gtgtgt for obj in someinstances ...    for somedata in datasource1 ...         for otherdata in datasource2 ...             ar  lview.applyasyncprocess, obj, somedata, otherdata ...             tasks.appendar ... gtgtgt  wait for computation to end gtgtgt results  [ar.get for ar in tasks]  codepre  h2Problemh2  pThat will obviously not work as the engines of the load balanced view will be unable to unpickle the instances passed as first argument to the codeprocesscode function. The process function definition itself is passed successfully as I assume that codeapplyasynccode does bytecode instrospection to pickle it by accessing the code.codecode attribute of the function and then just does a simple pickle for the remaining arguments.p  h2Possible solutions that dont work for meh2  ul lipOne alternative solution would be to use the codepxcode cell magic on the cell holding the definition of the class codeMyClasscode. However that would prevent me to build the class instances in the client script that also do the scheduling. I would need to copy and paste the cell content in an other cell without the codepxcode magic or execute the cell twice once with magic and another time without the magic but this is tedious when I am still editing the methods of the class in an iterative development amp evaluation setting.pli lipAn alternative solution would be to embed the class definition inside the codeprocesscode function but I find this not practical as I would like to reuse that class definition in other functions later in my notebook.pli lipAlternatively I could just stop using a class and only work with functions that can be shipped over to the engines by passing then as first argument to the codeapplyasynccode. However I dont like that either as I would like to prototype my code in an object oriented way for later extraction from the notebook and including the resulting class in an object oriented library. The notebook session serving as a collaborative prototyping tool using for exchanging ideas between developers using the a hrefhttpnbviewer.ipython.orghttpnbviewer.ipython.orga publisher.pli lipThe final alternative would be to write my class in a python module on a file on the filesystem and ship that file to the engines PYTHONPATH using NFS for instance. That works but prevent me to work only in the notebook environment which defeats the whole purpose of interactive prototyping in the notebook.pli ul  pSo basically, is there a way to define a class interactively and then ship its definition around to the enginesp  pIt should be possible to pickle a class definition using the codeinspect.getsourcecode in the client then send the source to the engines and use the codeevalcode builtin but unfortunately source inspection does not work for classes defined inside the codeDummyModcode builtin modulep  pcode TypeError ltIPython.core.interactiveshell.DummyMod object at 0x10c2c4e50gt is a builtin class codep  pIs there a way to inspect the bytecode of a class definition insteadp  pOr is it possible to use the codepxcode magic so as to both execute the content of the cell locally on the client and on each enginep

Negative 3664 pI currently have a set of AES EncryptionDecryption functions that I use in ASP.NET for all of my cryptographic needs. I then pass these data in apps back and forth to another secure application that I have no control over. Everything is sent in strings, and the strings are sent to and from these apps with an ASCII encoding.p  pNow I am working with a preexisting Silverlight app, where I have a need to add encryptdecrypt functionality to data, but I will still be sending to this other secure application over which I have no control that uses ASCII encoding. Since Silverlight uses UTF8, this seems like it might be a problem. I know enough about encodings to know how ASCII and UTF8 are alike and different 0 through 127 are the same in each, but UTF8 has many more characters. Are there any risks to encryptingdecrypting in UTF8 on my end if I am going to be sendingreceiving data tofrom an app that uses ASCII My app will not be using any nonstandard characters before the encryptionp  pAlso, should Ip  ol liUse a Service Reference in Silverlight that has my ASCII encryptiondecryption functions ORli liEncryptDecrypt in UTF8 inside Silverlight app, no service reference requiredli ol

Negative 3664 pI am testing Piwik if it would be suitable for analytics and tracking for my Ruby on Rails application. For testing purposes, I am running piwik on localhost, tracking the rails application running also on localhost. Piwik tracking is integrated by the piwikanalytics gem, and to track goal conversions I am using the piwiktracker gem. All my goals are manually converted by calling the goal conversion method from a controller.p  pMy problem is that I wish to record goal conversions by a custom variable scope visit, but this does not seem to work. The custom variable is set correctly, and the goals conversions are recorded correctly, but the goal conversions are not sortable by the value of the custom variable. p  pIn my application, there are three different types of users, and I wish to track their actions by user type. To this end, I have defined a custom variable which contains the user type. I have included setting this variable in the piwiktrackingtag in application.haml.html, because I cannot know the entry page beforehand. I see that the variable is set correctly, because visits are recorded by this variable. The goals, too, are converted correctly.p  pHowever, in the goals panel, when I click on the By custom variable option, I see 0 conversions for each different user type. p  pI am wondering if this is a Piwik issue, and not caused by me. I have also tried resetting the custom variable when calling the goal tracking methodp  precodepiwik.request.customvariable1,Role,userrole.trackgoal1 codepre  pbut this makes no difference.p

Negative 3664 pAs of early 2014, SVG spec does not have any builtin support for Boolean Operationsp  pBoolean operations are methods for altering the inherent geometry of mostly overlapping paths. They allow the construction of complicated shapes by performing operations on simpler shapes and are somehow similar to a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiConstructivesolidgeometry relnofollowConstructive Solid GeometryCSGa. p  pHowever this question refers to 2D vector paths.

Negative 3664 pWe are using Drupal for one of the sites we maintain and JQuery as the library. One of our pages is using the jqueryisotope plugin specially the viewsisotope module for sorting in views, and fancybox to display the contents of the body field in full. This is because, as it stands, most of the content of the body is hidden by a css height and an overflowhidden. p  pAs you can imagine, such a crude method doesnt really look pretty. Much of the text is cut off, leaving spare serifs and whatnot to make it look particularly dirty. The next step in this, then, was to truncate the text and append a ... so that text wouldnt get cut off. p  pHowever, fancybox pulls the content AS IS into the overlay. So when you truncate the text of the body, it truncates in the overlay, too.p  pBasically, my question is, is there a way to truncate the text until the click that opens fancybox occurs How would I send the full content to fancybox without losing the truncation when I click When I started a jsfiddle to work on this, I didnt incorporate either isotope or fancybox into my calculations I just built it out with a substring, cloned the original content, and then replaced the substring on click. But that, as you can imagine, breaks the page, because there is nothing to tell it ONLY to do this in relation to fancybox, and not just on random. Nor do I know how to resume the truncation of the text when fancybox closes. p  pHere is my a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netKwEeq22 relnofollowjsfiddlea. p  pHere is the html p  precodeltdiv classelementgt     ltdiv classitemgt         ltpgtLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy             nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.

Negative 3664 pWe are looking at options to build the front end of an application we are creating and are trying to evaluate a tool that will work for us and give us the best platform to move forwards.p  pThis is a Node.js project Our initial plan was to use Express and go down that route but we decided that before we kick off this stage it might be best to review what is out there.  Our application has several areas which we dont believe fit the single page model in that they are related from an application perspective but not from a view one.p  pWe have seen a few of the frameworks we could use to build out the client like Backbone, Meteor etc and also Angular.js.p  pThis may be a fairly obvious question but we cannot seem to decipher if angular.js is purely for single page applications or it can be used for multi page applications like Express for instance.p  pstrongUPDATE 17 July 2013strong Just to keep people in the loop, i will be updating this question as we go through the process.  We are going to build everything together for now, and we will see how well that performs.  We have reached out to a few people who are more qualified with Angular then us and posed the question regarding splitting up larger apps that share context but may be too large working on a single page.p  pThe consensus was that we could serve multiple static pages and create Angular apps that work with only those pages, effectively creating a collection of SPA and linking those apps together using standard linking.  Now our use case is very specific in our solution has several apps, and as i said we are going to try the single code base first and optimise from there. p

Negative 3664 pI am working with an asp.net mvc application that holds data in a sql server database. It has a customer table which obviously stores customers on the system. The id for customers is an identity column that holds the unique identifier for the customers, which auto increments by 1 for each new record.p  pFor certain controller actions in mvc app, the customer id is included. I understand in get requests, this creates a security loop hole. It enables external bodies to gain knowledge on the database structure etc.p  pIt would cause great difficulty to alter from using the customer id to another more obscure field in controller actions. Are there any other ways of exposing the id in a secure manner I was thinking about mapping the id to another id and storing it in session, exposing this alternative id but unfortunately session storage is not available to me. An in certain situations the exposed id may need to maintained past the users session. Another way that I have looked at is increasing the seed on the identity column to a number other than 1, lets say a random number of 88. This would mean the exposed id would mean less to the outside user.p  pAny thoughts or suggestions on the abovep

Negative 3664 pI am interested in tracking leg and foot positions of a human body, with the upper body being outside the field of view.

Apparently, a special mode for the opposite tracking the lower torso seems not available. However, there is this a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarymicrosoft.kinect.frameedges.aspx relnofollowFrameEdges Enumerationa which can seemingly be used to Find out how much of a users body is visible [...].

Negative 3664 pIm new to using asynchronous callbacks and Im not sure if what Im planning out is the appropriate way to go about doing things. Im working with Google App Engine along with Google Web Toolkit, and they provide a simple way to perform asynchronous callback methods with their RPC service. Ive got the basic asynchronous callbacks working fine, but now Im looking to do something a little more complicated. I want to set things up so that the part of my web app thats immediately available to the user will be loaded first so that theres something for the user to use as quick as possible. Then the next most available parts will be loaded and so on. Eventually I might even want to get more complicated and load everything in the order I just described unless the user clicks to do something else, then load that part first.p  pThe way Im thinking about doing this is just using the asynchronous function calls in GAE and GWT and just on a success of the one call start the next one. This should work, but the more parts that need to be loaded the more this code becomes a bit like spaghetti. Is there a better way to make and organize these asynchronous calls Does Google provide a better method to organize this that I dont know about Also, am I going down a completely wrong road and should be doing something very different Thank you muchp

Negative 3664 pI am trying to retrieve a table from the following strongActionstrong table p  pColumns ID, Name, Status, ProductID, UserID and several other non relevant column for this issue.p  pEvery time a user want a product I create a record like this   Name  Want, Status  True, ProductID  ID of the product wanted and UserID is the ID of the user.p  pThen every time a user unwant a product I create a record like this   Name  Want, Status  False, ProductID  ID of the product unwanted and UserID is the ID of the user.p  pI did that because I have other actions name in my table.p  pNow Id like to retrieve all the product wanted, so I should retrieve all the last want actions grouped by productid for a particular user ordered by descending createdat, and then only retrieve the action where the status  true.p  pSo to get all the last want actions grouped by productid for a User I did that p  precodeAction.selectDISTINCT ON productid productid,createdat, status,  .whereuserid    id amp name  want.groupproductid, id, status.order productid,createdat DESC codepre  pThat retrieve the last actions per product and user but retrieve both true and false statuses The only issue is that I dont know how to filter this table to only get the action if its true.p  pI tried to do it like this p  precodeAction.selectDISTINCT ON productid productid,createdat, status,  .whereuserid  id amp name  want.groupproductid, id, status.havingstatus  true.order productid,createdat DESC codepre  pBut that would give me the last actions where want  true.

Negative 3664 pWe would like to start using salesforce for managing sales contacts, but there is also some business functions regarding contacts that we would like to retain in our current system.p  pAs far as I can see, that means that were going to need a twoway sync Ie, when anything changes on salesforce, we need to update it on our system and vice versa.p  pIm suggesting some kind of messaging product that can sit in the middle and retry failed messages, because I have a feeling that without that, things are going to get very messy Eg, when one or other service is down.p  pThe manager on the project would like to keep it simple and feels that using messages rather then realtime pointtopoint calls is overkill, but I feel like without it were going to be in for a world of pain.p  pDoes anyone have any experience with trying to do twoway syncs actually even oneway suffers from the same risks I thinkp  pMany thanks for your insights..p

Negative 3664 pIn a library that Im writing I have a classp  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt class myclass  codepre  pand a functionp  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt void myfunction...  codepre  pI want to guarantee that a user of my code has called codemyfunctionltTgtcode somewhere in their code if they try to instantiate codemyclassltTgtcode. In other words, I want to generate a compile error if they try to instantiate the codemyclasscode template without also instantiating the corresponding codemyfunctioncode template.p  pExamplep  precodeint main      myfuncltintgt       cause instantiation of myfuncltintgt      myclassltintgt foo   okay, because myfuncltintgt exists     myclassltchargt bar  compile error myfuncltchargt does not exist  codepre  pNote that codemyclassltTgtcode does not need to use codemyfuncltTgtcode internally so instantiating it wont automatically cause codemyfuncltTgtcode to become instantiated.p  pstrongEdit[0]strong I cant call codemyfuncltTgtcode myself because I need the user to call it and pass in  information that tells the library how to handle codemyclassltTgtcode. ie. If they want to use  a codemyclassltchargtcode they need to explicitly say so in a particular place in the code. I could make codemyclassltTgtcode constructor test whether codemyfuncltTgtcode has been called generate a runtime error if it hasnt but Id prefer to be able to generate a compiletime error since its knowable at compiletime whether codemyfuncltTgtcode is ever used.p  pstrongEdit[1]strong One lessthanideal way to do it would be to make a codeMYFUNCcode macro that creates a template specialisation of an otherwise incomplete template class...p  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt class incomplete  define MYFUNCT templateltgt incompleteltTgt  static const bool x  myfuncltTgt   templatelttypename Tgt class myclass      templateltsizet igt     class empty       typedef emptyltsizeofincompleteltTgtgt breakeverything  codepre  pNow the user can only use a codemyclassltTgtcode if codeMYFUNCTcode is used somewhere. However Id prefer a solution that doesnt use macros and doesnt force the user to use codeMYFUNCcode at global scope rather than in a function.p  pstrongEdit[2]strong Thanks for the answers everyone. I realise its impossible to guarantee at compile that the user will isnt calling codemyfuncltTgtcode incorrectly. But I can make it pretty unlikely and make it generate a runtime error early on if they do.p  pTheyre supposed to define a function called, lets say, codeinitialiselibrarycode. The function looks like thisp  precodevoid initialiselibrary      myfuncltintgt     myfuncltchargt     etc..  codepre  pDuring the library initialisation, it checks to make sure none of the codemyfunccodes have been called. It then calls codeinitialiselibrarycode. It then checks to make sure all of the codemyfuncscode have been called. This much is doable. If the user hasnt defined codeinitialiselibrarycode they get a linker error. If they havent called codemyfuncltTgtcode somewhere in their program for a codemyclassltTgtcode that they use then idealy they get a compile error. If theyve defined codeinitialiselibrarycode emandem theyve used codemyfuncltTgtcode somewhere embutem theyve used it in the wrong place they get a runtime error when their program starts up.p  pBasically I want to stop them from adding a codemyclassltTgtcode somewhere in their code and forgetting to put codemyfuncltTgtcode in codeinitialiselibrarycode, because thats something theyre likely to do. The only way to runtime check this would be during the construction of codemyclassltTgtcode. This will be an annoyingly late time to make this check if they only use codemyclassltTgtcode in a deep and rarelyused chunk of code.p

Negative 3664 pIm looking for a way to do the equivalent of Perls HTTPAsync modules nextresponse methodp  pThe HTTPAsync module doesnt spawn any background threads, nor does it use any callbacks. Instead, every time anyone in my case, the main thread calls nextresponse on the  object, all the data that has been received by the OS so far is read blocking, but instantaneous since it only processes data thats already been received. If this is the end of the response, then nextresponse returns an HTTPResponse object, otherwise it returns undef.p  pUsage of this module looks something like pseudocodep  precoderequest  HTTPAsyncurl do     response  requestgtnextresponse     if not response         sleep 5  or process events or whatever while not response   Do things with response codepre  pAs far as I can see, Pythons urllib or http.client dont support this style.

Negative 3664 pNeed a little help from someone who knows a little about logisticsp  hr  pI am currently working with an application known as Framework. The application is not really something that I am familiar with, but regardless I can figure out how it works. One of the tabs running in the application is for expected orders shipping trucks. Within that, I am able to see where an outbound trucks current location is, as well as its destination. I am trying to add functionality to the application that would allow me to see an estimated time of arrival to its current destination  the drive back to my location. This seems simple enough, but Im trying to figure out the best way that I could calculate this. I looked into The Google Distance Matrix API, but I have no need to display a map on the application, all I want is the ETA. I am pretty inexperienced with this kind of thing, so I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction. Thanks guys.p  pThis may not be the best forum for this question...p

Negative 3664 pSo my application is an iframe based ecommerce cart cart session is stored on the accessing domain.  When a user checks out the iframe deploys a pop up login to our SAAS which clears our domain for cross domain cookies.  After the pop up login is authenticated the popup closes and the iframe refresh and loads the users check out with their stored information all done correctly.  The cart session is past over to the iframe via http queries, so it is correctly hitting the server.p  pThe problem area My application deploys multiple cookies cart session, referring site, etc, it seems that ONLY on the iPhone and iPad safari, the headers dont show multiple cookies being set.  Only one is being set.  Keep in mind that I have my php header declaring valid multiple cookies or technically multiple headers allowed.

Negative 3664 pI am trying to create a database that will store a table of Devices and a Table of actions. Each device will be associated with multiple actions. There will be a lot of overlap between actions. For example, both an iPhone and Android phone would have basic actions such as Shake, Swipe, etc. To avoid creating many duplicate actions, I was planning to introduce a third table that maps Devices to Actions via their IDs.

Negative 3664 pOriginally, I have a main table view controller with a tableview of static cells laid out using Storyboards. Subsequently, I added a SearchDisplayController to this UITableViewController. In my tableview data source delegate methods such as numberOfSectionsInTableView and numberOfRowsInSection, I am differentiating between my own tableview with the static cells and the searchResultsTableView of the search display controller by checking the followingp  precodeif tableView  self.searchDisplayController.searchResultsTableView      logic for searchResultsTableView  else     logic for my main tableView  codepre  pAs far as I know, this seems to be the right approach. But when I tried the following for the cellForRowAtIndexPath method, I am getting a crash with the message Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException, reason UITableView dataSource must return a cell from tableViewcellForRowAtIndexPathp  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      if tableView  self.searchDisplayController.searchResultsTableView               Just want to use a default cell.

I guess my question is, how should I handle a hybrid case in cellForRowAtIndexPath as well as specifying both kinds of cells in the same storyboard, where I have a search display controller tableview with dynamic cells and a tableview with static cells I would imagine such a scenario to be not uncommon. p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pWhile calling the super method in the else clause as suggested by the first commenter seemed to fix the crash, I am encountering yet another issue which I feel is somehow due to inherent issues of the tableViewController being a delegate of both a static tableview and a nonstatic one the search display results table view. p  pThe new issue My static tableview has 2 static cells. When I populate my search results tableview with more than 2 rows, I get a NSRangeException, reason [NSArrayI objectAtIndex] index 2 beyond bounds [0 .. 1]. p  pIt seems like the searchResultsTableView derived the number of rows from my main static tableview somehow results were consistent when I added a 3rd static cell even though the delegate method numberOfRowsInSection was being fired for the case of searchResultsTableView, and returning the right number.p  pAny workarounds on making static tableviews play nice with search display tableviews I am thinking of converting my main static tableview to one with dynamic cells.. Any other suggestions are welcome, thanksp
Negative 3664 pI have an application that uses JBoss Cache to cache some internal objects and the cache data is persisted in a MySQL database. When the application starts, data persisted in the database will be loaded into the cache. Java serialization mechanism is used to persist the data. I assigned a fixed value to codeserialVersionUIDcode field for those persistent Java classes.p  pThe problem is that when someone introduces incompatible changes to the serialization format, then the cache data loading from database will fail due to deserialization errors. After some researches, I got some possible solutions, but not sure which one is the best.p  ol liChange the codeserialVersionUIDcode to use a new version. This approach seems to be easy. But do I need to change all the classes codeserialVersionUIDcode field value to the new version, or just the actually changed classes Because whats been read is actually an object graph, if different serialization versions are used for different classes, will that be a problem when deserializing the whole object graphli liUse the same codeserialVersionUIDcode value but create my own codereadObjectcode and writeObject. li liUse codeExternalizablecode interface.li ol  pWhich approach may be the best solutionp

Negative 3664 pThis is a strange one.  So I have an Ajax Toolkit file uploader called AsyncFileUpload located in an update panel.  This AsyncFileUpload control, as soon as you put a file there, begins to upload it and calls the server.  I then store this file as a BLOB and obtain the row ID from a database table using SELECT IDENTITY.  So far so good, I now have a row ID and I wish to store it.  I placed it inside a hidden field but when AsyncFileUpload calls OnClientUploadComplete, hidden field is blank  So I thought okay, Ill just store it in a ViewState.  Much to my surprise, same thing happened the viewstate gets cleared.  Finally I had success with using a Session variable.  My question is, why does Session variable work and ViewState or HiddenField do notp  pFRONTp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function UploadCompletesender, args          var fileSize  args.getlength         if fileSize gt 2000000              alertLogo size must be smaller than 2MB                   [idhfUploadSuccessful].val1         Calls a postback and thus lvMembersPreRender gets executed to get results         doPostBackltUpdatePanel1.ClientID gt, null      ltscriptgt                                      ltdiv iddivClassFileUploadgt                                         ltaspAsyncFileUpload IDAsyncFileUpload1 runatserver Width350 CssClassFileUploadClass floatLeft                                             UploaderStyleModern                                             CompleteBackColorLime                                             ErrorBackColorRed                                             ThrobberIDThrobber                                             UploadingBackColor66CCFF                                             OnClientUploadErroruploadError                                              OnClientUploadStartedStartUpload                                             OnClientUploadCompleteUploadComplete                                             OnUploadedCompleteAsyncFileUpload1UploadedComplete gt                                     ltdivgt codepre  pBACKp  blockquote precode    protected void AsyncFileUpload1UploadedCompleteobject sender, AjaxControlToolkit.AsyncFileUploadEventArgs e                   hfSelectedArticleId.Value  dt.Rows[0][ArticleId].ToString             ViewState.AddArticleId, dt.Rows[0][ArticleId].ToString             Session.AddArticleId, dt.Rows[0][ArticleId].ToString           codepre blockquote  pEDIT Found a similar post that sort of explains it.

Negative 3664 pIm working on an Android app that turns a devices screen off when the light sensor value is below a threshold value and turns the screen on again when the light sensor value rises above the threshold value. This threshold value is decided by the user through a onetime calibration. Everything works great, the screen turns on and off when its supposed to and Ive dealt with the constant fluctuations in the light sensors values so that the screen doesnt keep turning on and off randomly.p  pThe issue Im facing is that when the power button is pressed, the light sensors onSensorChanged event is triggered for some reason. This means that if the user presses the power button to turn the screen off, its automatically turn back on if its in the right lighting.p  pThe solution I thought of was to keep a flag variable that wont allow the code in my service to execute if the power button was pressed but the issue there is that Android does not allow me to detect a power button key press from a service.p  pIs there another possible perhaps a more logical workaround to this issuep  pI dont think it would be helpful to post the code but let me know if you need me to post it.p  pThanks.p

Negative 3664 pCan I use JPA codeVersioncode with Spring Data RESTp  pIn Spring Data REST 1.1.0.M1 I can configure the repo exporter to expose the entity ID, which as it happens also exposes codeVersioncodeannotated fields. So I thought that if I tried to codePUTcode an entity with some old version number, Id get the codeOptimisticLockExceptioncode. But that doesnt occur. Instead the codePUTcode succeeds including data updates, except that the version number is always strictly incremented instead of being whatever old version I set it to.p  pI read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2572566javajpaversionannotationherea that Im not supposed to set the version number myself, since the behavior is undefined. That makes sense. But it seems that this makes codeVersioncode useless in cases where all I have is the JSON representation of an entity instead of having a reference to the entity with the JSON representation Id need to send the version number back to the service, which would eventually call codesetVersioncode, which in turn leads to undefined behavior.p  pAm I understanding the situation correctly Can I use codeVersioncode with Spring Data RESTp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Given Martens response, I ended up using JPA events to achieve the optimistic locking capability.

Negative 3664 pI have two servers M1, M2 at different locationsp  pThe requirement is M1 just triggers a function at M2 say GetData and returns. After that function GetData at M2 executes, it will send the response to M1, say a text file.p  pNeed to implement SSL certificates in this scenario so that M2 should know M1 is authorized to call GetData function and when M2 starts sending data, it make sure M1 is the only one who requested the data and will deliver the file to M1 only not any body else.p  pI know WCF but I never used SSL Certificates. Also, if M2 is a different source at allsay an API from a vendor, then how I should give certificate to M2.p  pAny helpp
Negative 3664 pI am very new to Rails, and I cant understand how can I log something from a particular controller method.

Negative 3664 pWe have an application that allows users exchange messages, and delivers the message through email. But we dont reveal senders email, instead every time a message is sent out a new email address gets generated for the From field. Something similar to the way Facebook or LinkedIn send out messages. Everything works fine, except the recipients email client caches all these email addresses.  For instance, if Jack sends two messages to Jill, the senders addresses can be a123FakeEmail.com and a456FakeEmail.com, so next time Jill composes a new message and starts typing Jacks name, the email client suggests two addresses for Jack. p  pSo my question is, how we can prevent email caching on clients machine Is there something similar to HTTP header Pragma nocache for SMTPp  pThanks Nivreshp

Negative 3664 pCorrect me if Im wrong, but I thought Ember should most of the model  view binding for you What would be the case when you have to manually track model changes and updaterefresh the view accordinglyp  pThe app Im working have nested routes and models associated with them.p  precodeApp.Router.mapfunction      this.resourceexams, path exams, function          this.resourceexam, path examid, function             this.resourcequestions, path questions, function                  this.routequestion, path questionid                  this.routenew                             codepre  pEverything works fine and Im able to get exams and questions separately from the rest server.p  pFor each model I have appropriate codeEmber.ArrayControllercode and codeEmber.ObjectControllercode to deal with list and single model items in the view. Basically for both models the way I handle things is IDENTICAL except for the fact that one is nested within the other. strongOne more difference is that to display the nested route data Im using another outlet  the one that is inside the first template.strongp  pNow the problem is that the top level model binding to the views is handled automatically by Ember without any special observers, bindings etc..  e.g. When I add new item it is saved and  the list view is refreshed to reflect the change or when the item is deleted it is auto removed from the view. It just works cp  pFor second model question, on the other hand, Im able to reproduce all the crud behaviour and it works fine, but the UI is not updated automatically to reflect the changes.p  pFor instance I had to something like this when adding new entry the line in question has a commentp  precodeApp.QuestionsController  Ember.ArrayController.extend     needs [exam],     actions          create function               var examid  this.getcontrollers.exam.id             var title  this.getnewQuestion             if title.trim  return              var item  this.store.createRecordquestion,                  title title,                 examid examid                          item.save             this.setnewQuestion,              this.getcontent.pushObjectitem  lt this somehow important to update the UI                codepre  pWhereas it was handled for me for exam modelp  pWhat am I doing wrong How do I get Ember.js to track and bind model and change the UI for mep

Negative 3664 pI am using a Bootstrap modal for users to choose product options before adding an item to their cart. Ive used them before in this scenario with no issues but this one isnt closing as expected. p  pWhen a user clicks on the Add To Cart button, a few things happen and Im thinking the problem lies there. First, some script checks that certain fields have been completed correctly. Once that is all verified, the user is allowed to add the item to their cart at which point another window pops up for them to review their cart content and choose to either proceed to cart or continue where they left off.p  pId like the modal window to close once the Add To Cart button is clicked, after the script has verified all fields are filled out as necessary.

Ive also tried to look for the files online after I create a typemap file there it asks for a xsubpp file aswell, but to no avail.p  pHow do I install those modules so that the correct files will be therep

Negative 3664 pI am trying to implement an Onion architecture for a ASP.Net MVC 5 project. I have seen opinions that services should be injected rather than instantiated even though, correct me if I am wrong, the idea expressed by Jeffery Palermo a hrefhttpjeffreypalermo.comblogtheonionarchitecturepart3 relnofollowhttpjeffreypalermo.comblogtheonionarchitecturepart3a was that any outer layer should be able to directly call any inner layer. So my question is p  ol liCan the onion architecture work without IOC, and if yes, is it idealli liLets say we go with IOC, if the UI should not know about the actual implementation of domain services, should we apply the same principle to the domain models themselves e.g. injecting models into the UI instead of referencing them directlyli ol  pI am understand why some solutions apply IOC on domain services but are accessing the domain models directly in the controllers.p

I check connecting from telnet any response I should receive when I send some IRC commands, but now the buffer do not send me all I suppose I should get from the server, knowin the irc protocol.p  pHere is the main method of the class when I instanciat my bot core class and handle buffer readingp  precodepublic  static void mainString[] args     String name  Robocot777     String server  irc.freenode.net     String channel  botwar     String owner  M1k3     int port  6667      final Bot bot1  Bot.getInstanceserver,              channel, name, owner, port      bot1.setVerbosetrue     bot1.connect     bot1.nickname      whiletrue         try              String buffer              whilebuffer  bot1.getReader.readLine  null                 String[] splitBuffer  buffer.split                 System.out.printlnnBUFFER   buffer                 ifbuffer.containsPING                     System.out.printlnThe buffer totally contains PING on it                 ifsplitBuffer[0].trim.equalsPING                     System.out.printlnWe got receive a PING                     bot1.pongsplitBuffer[1]                 ifsplitBuffer[0].trim.equalsERROR                         ampamp splitBuffer[1].equalsClosing Link                     System.out.printlnWe got receive an ERROR  Closing Link                     bot1.waitTime                     bot1.setConnectedfalse                     bot1.connect                                   ifbuffer.contains433 ampamp splitBuffer.length gt 1                     ifsplitBuffer[1].split [1].equals433  The nick is already in use                         ifbot1.isRegistered  false                             System.err.printlnThe nick   name   is already in usen                                     So, Im leaving...set other nick                             System.exit1                                                                                 ifbuffer.contains451 ampamp buffer.split .length gt 1                     ifbuffer.split [1].equals451  User must register first on the server                         System.out.printlnMust register Asked                         bot1.setJoinnedfalse                         bot1.setUseredfalse                         bot1.userbot1.getName, Im just a bot                         bot1.joinbot1.getChannel                                                        ifbuffer.contains474 ampamp buffer.split .length gt 1                     ifbuffer.split [1].equals474  User can join channel, probably banned b                         System.out.printlnWow We have been banned                         bot1.setJoinnedfalse                         bot1.joinbot1.getChannel                                                        ifbuffer.containsKICK ampamp buffer.split .length gt 1                     ifbuffer.split [1].equalsKICK  Bot have been kicked                             ampamp buffer.split [2].equalsIgnoreCasebot1.getChannel                             ampamp buffer.split [3].equalsIgnoreCasename                         System.out.printlnWow We have been kicked                         bot1.setJoinnedfalse                         bot1.waitTime                         bot1.joinbot1.getChannel                                                             catch IOException e              e.printStackTrace                codepre  pYes, its a very messy method, Its like that again in my disperate for gerring what is the error. p  pAnd now here is my connect method, which I think is the relevant herep  precodepublic void connect     try          System.out.printlnServer   this.server  tChannel           this.channel  tBot name   this.name  tPort   port         socket  new Socketthis.server, this.port         socket.setKeepAlivetrue         setWriternew PrintWritersocket.getOutputStream, true         setReadernew BufferedReadernew InputStreamReadersocket.getInputStream         setConnectedtrue         setJoinnedfalse         setUseredfalse      catch UnknownHostException e          System.err.printlnWe got an error   e.getMessage         e.printStackTrace      catch IOException e          System.err.printlnWe got an error   e.getMessage         e.printStackTrace        codepre  pAnd yes, I send the commands to the server with carriege return and all thatp  precode writer.writeNICK   name  rn codepre  pSo, as I said before, my problem is that Im not getting the whole bugger from the server with my BufferedReader object, so I would highly appreciate any help.p  pGreetings.p

In the given tutorial you can set a certain threshold such that you can count the good and the bad matches, but thats not a justification that everthing was matched correctly.

Negative 3664 pagain because of curiosity I am trying to create a simple scrapbook page wherein the user can add frames, ribbon, balloons and other images on the editable layout. The problem is that I dont know where to start. I just tried this app call Everybody Scrapbooking from Google play and I was really amazed on how the author implemented the image rotation, cropping and adding sets of images in a single layout. The outcome is that I wanted to know how they do it. After the user is done with adding pictures heshe can then save the project and reedit it again if heshe wants to. Can you guys give me some hints on how to start this project Ive already read some tutorials on image rotation, cropping but still cant figure out how to put them together.p

Negative 3664 pAllp  pI need advise on how to use Nuget to make my project dependencies libraries available to other developers who will in turn have my project as dependency. See scenario below for detailsp  pI have created a Visual Studio 2013 project ProjA in a solution SolA which has a dependency on a Library LibA [which I do not commit into source control]. I have used Nuget to managefetch the dependencies of project ProjA i.e. library LibA via Nuget.Config in .nuget folder at solution SolA level and everything is working ok. Developers are able to checkout solution SolA and builddeploy with Nuget fetching LibA from a local server.p  pMy issue is that I now need to have developers build their project ProjB in another solution SolB but which will importuse ProjA as a dependent project. Issue is that I cannot find a way to make Nuget fetch the dependencies of ProjA i.e. LibA when built as part of solution SolB. I tried putting the Nuget.Config File in the level of ProjA, but VS build seems to ignore it.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 3664 pI know Agile came about as a group of adaptive software development methods, where Scrum is one of them.p  pSome background We are an innovative web agency, which implies design and development. We have multiple projects running and we use JIRA to log hours and create issues. JIRA  also have a Agile method where you can have your scrumboard online instead of offline. p  pWe want to start using Scrum for our project management or at least, use elements of Scrum. Im aware of the difficulties and the principles Scrum has in order to make a Scrum project a success. Yet, I think its possible to run multiple projects at the same time, using some elements of Scrum with minimal resources. We have a very small team, 3 developers 1 frontend2 backend and 1 Interaction Designer. p  pOur problem basically is that we have to manage multiple projects but we have a small team, so little capacity velocity.  So my one million dollar question is How can we manage multiple projects, as we design, develop AND test our products as one single Scrum team p  pAs for one project it is already difficult enough. Can you design, develop and test everything in 1 or 2 week sprint And how do you prevent the fact that other projectsclients wont be waiting for a month...p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 3664 pLets consider a twopage Silverlight WP application the main page PageA, and another PageB we can open from PageA and pass a parameter into it. As Charles Petzold suggests in his bestseller Programming WP7, we can instantiate PageB using a statement like thisp  precodeNavigationService.Navigatenew Uri     EditEntryPage.xamlItemIndex  myItemIndex, UriKind.Relative codepre  pAnd then use the following construct in the OnNavigatedToOnNaviagetdFrom events of PageB to process the parameter and the case when the app was tombstoned and reactivated againp  precodeprotected override void OnNavigatedToNavigationEventArgs e      string myParam     if this.NavigationContext.QueryString.TryGetValueItemIndex, out myParam              fItemIndex  int.ParsemyParam          else if PhoneApplicationService.Current.State.ContainsKeyAPPSTATEKEYITEMINDEX              fItemIndex  intPhoneApplicationService.Current.State[APPSTATEKEYITEMINDEX]        protected override void OnNavigatedFromNavigationEventArgs e      PhoneApplicationService.Current.State[APPSTATEKEYITEMINDEX]  fItemIndex  codepre  pHowever, we have one problem if the user left the app from PageB, the app was tombstoned, and the user returns again to the app to the same PageB using the task manager. In this case, codeNavigationContext.QueryStringcode in the OnNavigatedTo event returns the same ItemIndex parameter as if the page were called from PageA and the second if is never executedp  pDid I miss something important an app settings, etc, or the behavior was changed in WP8 and we can no longer use this approachp

Negative 3664 pI wonder about performance difference of 2 indexing options 1  multivalued field 2  separate fieldsp  pThe case is as follows Each document has 100 properties prop1..prop100.  The values are strings and there is no relation between different properties. I would like to search by exact match on several properties by known values like ids. For example search for all docs having prop1blue and prop6highp  pI can choose to build the indexes in 1 of 2 ways 1  the trivial way  100 separate fields, 1 for each property, multiValuedfalse. the values are just property values. 2  1 field named properties multiValuedtrue. The field will have 100 values value1prop1blue.. value6high etcp  pIs it correct to say that option1 will have much better performance in searching How about saving performancep  pthanx, Pavelp

Negative 3664 pHi everyone I have a table which stores visits of users on a museum. Every record is a visit of a visitor on a particular day and it has a column which stores the number of minors that came to the museum with the visitor i.e if I have a number of 3 minors it means that that visit was made by 4 people, the visitor and 3 minors.p  pI need to select the day where there was the max number of visitors minors included and I have made a query like thisp  precodeSELECT  FROM      SELECT COUNT  SUMvisitanumerominorenni as numberofvisitors, visitdate     FROM visite      WHERE visitdate BETWEEN 20140613 AND 20140620     GROUP BY visitdate  as b  WHERE numberofvisitors IN      SELECT MAXnumberofvisitors as numberofvisitors     FROM          SELECT COUNT  SUMnumberofminors as numberofvisitors, visitdate         FROM visite          WHERE visitdate BETWEEN 20140613 AND 20140620         GROUP BY visitdate      as c  codepre  pLet me explain how it works quickly The SELECT COUNT  SUMnumberofminors.... subquery recovers the total number of visitors per day in the specified range e.g. BETWEEN 20140613 AND 20140620, an example of the output isp  precodenumberofvisitors       date     58                   20140614     48                   20140615     41                   20140616     20                   20140617     138                  20140618     9                    20140619 codepre  pThen I simply need to recover the penultimate record of this subquery cause the max number of visitors in a day is 138, in the date 20140618. So I use a WHERE clause with an IN  which now takes a subquery with the MAX aggregate function and returns the expected resultp  precodenumberofvisitors       date 138                      20140618 codepre  pIt works but I think it is not efficient to run the COUNT  SUM... subquery twice, what do you think Can I improve this query p

Negative 3664 pIm considering using single table inheritance for my contacts model in order to implement different behaviour for different kinds of contacts. As I understand it Rails determines which model.rb, controllers, routes and so on to use by looking at the value of the type column in contact.rb.p  pI intend to use a single create form for contacts where users can select the type of contact in a select box. But how would this work if my default application language is german So instead of selecting a contact type like customer, users will select Kunde  however of course I dont want to mess up my filenames and would like to use customer.rb, customerscontroller.rb, customerpath and so on.p  pWhile I understand that you can kind of hide this problem by using german names and english values in the forms select box, it will be an issue as soon as I want to display the value anywhere else, where it needs to be german.p  pAm I missing something is or STI just not worth the effort if your app is not englishp

Negative 3664 pIn our web application, we are trying to allow users download large files upwards of tens of gigabytes for a file storage application. Currently we have a client side download method using the now discontinued LocalFileSystem a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPILocalFileSystem relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPILocalFileSystema feature.p  pOur reason for moving from our previous method of serverside downloads to a javascriptbased solution was for error handling and progress reporting. The files actually stored in chunks, and we need to stream them from the server to the client upon download. However, due to compression and several other factors, we cannot determine the content length before initializing the download, so any attempt to set a contentlength header would be futile.p  pWithout using LocalFileSystem, browsers like FireFox are forced to load the entire file in a javascript object in ram out of local storage to prompt the user to save the file.p  pMy question is this Is there any way to save these files via javascript without loading the entire thing in ram or are we forced to move back to our server side downloadp

Negative 3664 pBackground Many people are familiar with the socalled Birthday Paradox that, in a room of 23 people, there is a better than 5050 chance that two of them will share the same birthday. In its more general form for n people, the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is pn  365  365n 365n. Similar calculations are used for understanding hashspace sizes, cryptographic attacks, etc.p  pMotivation The reason for asking the following question is actually related to understanding a specific financial market behavior. However a variant on the Birthday Paradox problem fits exactly as an analogy and is likely to be of wider interest to people with different backgrounds. My question is therefore framed in these more familiar terms, as follows.p  pQuestion There are a total of 60 people in a room. Of these, it turns out that there are 11 eleven PAIRS of people who share the same birthday, and one TRIPLE i.e. group of 3 people who have the same birthday. The remaining 60  211  3  35 people have different birthdays. Assuming a population in which any day is equally likely for a birthday i.e. ignore Feb 29th amp possible seasonal effects and, given the specified distribution of birthdays, what is the probability that these 60 people had been chosen at randomp

Negative 3664 pI can make a three.js skybox using 6 separate image files.  But I want to be able to build a skybox from a single image made up of  tiles.p  pFor example if I have a composite tiled image as source see a hrefhttpwww.zen226082.zen.co.ukSTACKEXCHANGEGiantA.jpg relnofollowhttpwww.zen226082.zen.co.ukSTACKEXCHANGEGiantA.jpga... i dont have enough rep to post it here .p  pI can load the composite image into a canvas and copy each tile into a cache buffer and then send them into a Three.js materials array.  The materials are then used to make a skybox.p  pHowever there are two problems.  p  pProblem 1 is that the composite image needs to be flipped.  I can do this easilly in a graphics app like Paint.net but it would be nice to be able to do it programmatically in javascriptthree.js.p  pProblem 2 is that Three.js requires that the tiles for Y and Y also need to be rotated 180 degrees.  This is difficult for me to do in a graphics application.  For example here is a composite tiled image after modification to suit the Three.js code which I have been using  a hrefhttpwww.zen226082.zen.co.ukSTACKEXCHANGEGiantB.jpg relnofollowhttpwww.zen226082.zen.co.ukSTACKEXCHANGEGiantB.jpga Horriblep  pMy Question  Is there some way that I can perform a 180 degree rotation on the two tiles after extracting them from the composite image and before passing them into the skybox construction.p  pEDIT 10th August 2014 The Question should be How to make a three.js skyBox from a single image file made up of 12 equalsized tiles.p  pHere is the code I have been usingp  precode    var skyBoxGeometry  new THREE.CubeGeometryskyboxsidelength,skyboxsidelength,skyboxsidelength      var skyBoxMaterialArray  []      var widthOfOnePiece   20484...i.e. 512     var heightOfOnePiece  15363...i.e. 512     var numColsToCut  4     var numRowsToCut  3      var image  new Image     image.src  TRIVPfilesimagesSOWskybox20481536v7.jpg     image.onload  SOWFcutImageUp     ...

Negative 3664 pIs there a reliable way to check for screen resolution using CSS  I say reliable as I have been using the minresolution media query which appeared to be working when my site was used on my desktop PC.  However, when used with a tablet specifically a Windows Surface Pro 2 the screen DPI being reported was not what you would expect and my media query did not work.p  pUltimately what I am trying to achieve is for larger buttons to be displayed when the screen DPI is over a certain value. The buttons look small otherwise. So I have CSS like thisp  precodemedia screen      .uitoppane          minheight 135px         width 100        media screen and minresolution 192dpi,              webkitmindevicepixelratio 2      .uitoppane          minheight 175px         width 100       codepre  pBut even though a Surface Pro 2 has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 and a screen size of 10, the DPI being reported is just 96.  So this would appear to be an unreliable way to detect this.  If this is the case, can anyone suggest a better way to do thisp  pMany thanks.p

So when you press it to return to the above activity, it opens a new instance without being restored. I call codefinishcode upon hitting that back button, so if I remove it, all it does when clicking this button to open the activity abovep  precode        vitals  Button findViewByIdR.id.vitals     vitals.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener           Override         public void onClickView v               TODO Autogenerated method stub             try             Class goVitals  Class.forNamecom.vexos.emspal.Vitals             Intent goIntent  new IntentTools.this, goVitals             startActivitygoIntent             catchClassNotFoundException e                 e.printStackTrace                          finish               codepre  pIt opens a NEW instance with still no saved values. It does not resume the old instance with the saved values. However, if you hit the back button to KILL this new instance, it reveals the saved instance with the stored value. codefinishcode seems to be the only way to get it to not do this, but it kills the activity so things may not be saved.p

Negative 3664 pthe issue is this, When you use the HTML file input type , allmost mobile browsers offer you the choice to  Take a picture or Select from a gallery p  pOn the iPad this is shown as     Take Photo Or  video    Photo Library p  pIf you click on Photo Library it gives you an option to    Load from the gallery.p  pWhen using the strongjQueryFileUploadstrong that offers multiple files uploads and drag amp drop etc  , on the Ipad it strongskipsstrong the first step and goes straight to Load from Gallery .  This is a major problem for us  .p  pUsing the official demo of the libraries we use a hrefhttpsblueimp.github.iojQueryFileUpload relnofollowhttpsblueimp.github.iojQueryFileUploada this behaves in the same way, so I have to assume our implementation is correct p  pNote     This also does not work when using Chrome on an iPhone     This does seem to work as expected on Android devices p  pAny ideas gratefully received .. p

Negative 3664 pI am using a 32.768Khz sec oscillator with the PIC24fj64ga002 to make use of the RTCC of the PIC. So far my RTCC code is working but I am not able to get my oscillator to work properly. I used an alarm of 1 minute to toggle an led using RTCC but I am getting the RTCC interrupt at around 13sec and thus some error. For the secondary oscillator I have connected it in the required pins of the PIC and enabled it using   OSCCONbits.SOSCEN1. Do I need to do anything more to make the sec oscillator to work. I checked the oscillator using a logic analyser but I am not getting any signals. But my led does toggle though the interval when set for 1 minute is giving me only 13 seconds.  Even when I test my RTCC code the seconds and minuted seems to be updating at a far greater pace.  Please tell me if I should paste my RTCC code. Do tell me if I need to make any changes for setting the Sec oscillator other than the one I had mentioned.p

By the way, boardwindow is a gui object, gameboard is my internal logic gameboard array, redraw has the gui redraw to update the positions of the pieces, and restart restarts the internal logic board to the original starting gamestate. The gui class is a swing gui that is pretty simple, and works pretty well. The problem is, in the game loop, when its checkmate, the loop breaks and the runner function ends. The user should then be able to press the new game button in the gui, to have the game restart after the checkmate. The new game button calls resetGame. The problem is that the gui window freezes when runner is called again, and Im not sure why, it wouldnt need multiple threads for this, I thought. I have other buttons which call functions that I have not shown you, and those functions call other functions like restart and such, and they have no problem, its only when runner is called. p  pI know my other code is probably awful in formatting and convention, but please try to keep answers focused on the main problem.p  pThanksp

To find out the number of LOGINATTEMPT I also wrote an expression in SSRS by adding another column called as Count and then typing the following function CountFieldseventtype.Valuep  pHowever the above query wont give me the number of LOGINATTEMPT for a particular assignment performed since for datawebappsassignmentuploadAssignment the eventtype for this data is COURSEACCESS . p  pstrongIn short I need to find number of LOGINATTEMPT event type in a range of data from Login succeeded to Logout succeeded such that within this range there is data called as webappsassignmentuploadAssignment where data and eventtype are fields and LOGINATTEMPT and webappsassignmentuploadAssignment are records in eventtype and data respectivelystrong My doubt is how do we find a record consisting of a string within a range of records that are itself strings Is there a way to do this in SSRS Filters Thank you in advance p
Negative 3664 pHello Im quite new to Kendo UI so my question is probably simple as well. I am working with datasource of Kendo UI Javascript that reads a simple JSON object from a remote source, what works fine.  I struggle now with populating the data into single text fields within the HTML page. I find some example on Kendo UI documention talking about template, model, columns, binding, etc. but there is nothing I think I can adapt it to my needs. All examples I find are focussed on Kendo Widgets or grid, what is not what I want.p  pExample  I read the JSON by datasource object from remote source, looking like this  [productid30,titleapple]p  pIn my HTML there are two input fields, one with IDproductid and another one with IDtitlep  pI dont need a precise code solution just a hintlink how to proceed to populate the JSON elements into the value attributes of the two input fields. If this is possible is there also the other way possible like storing the values of the input fields back to a datasource and send it back to remote server for savingupdating purposesp  pAny hint is welcomep

Negative 3664 pMy understanding of Java synchronized blocks is that, if a thread already owns a lock on an object, it can enter a different block synchronized on the same object reentrant synchronization.  Underneath, I believe that the JVM uses a reference count to incrementdecrement the number of times a thread has acquired a lock, and that the lock is only released when the count is zero.p  pSo my question is, if one encounters a piece of code that looks like thisp  precodesynchronizedthis      if condition  WAITING              synchronizedthis                      condition  COMPLETE              notify              try                              wait                          catchInterruptedException  e                                             else         condition  READY  codepre  pwhat specifically happens when wait is called  Does it merely decrement the count, or does it release the lock regardless of the count  p  pIn the first case, it seems to me that it will produce a deadlock if lock reentry had occurred, because it will still own the lock and would thus wait forever on another thread which is waiting on it.p  pIn the second case, I cant really see what the point of the second synchronized block is at all.p  pThe documentation for wait says p  blockquote   pThe current thread must own this objects monitor. The thread releases ownership of this monitor and waits until another thread notifies threads waiting on this objects monitor to wake up either through a call to the notify method or the notifyAll method. The thread then waits until it can reobtain ownership of the monitor and resumes execution,p blockquote  pso I think that the second case is the correct one, but I could be wrong.

Negative 3664 pI am using Spring oAuth with JdbcTokenStore for persisting tokens. Everything is working fine and everything is configured in XML, but I cant find a way to increase the validity of tokens given a specific event.p  pFor example, instead of having a fixed validity, I would like to when the user logs in, that both the access and refresh token increase their validity, or at least the refresh token since the access token is used in other places but the refresh is only for the authentication server.p  pMaking the user log out because the refresh token has expired seems counter productive IF they usually use the app. But if the user would stay too long without using the app then the refresh token could expire no problem and make the user login again.

Negative 3664 pI a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma295480902398375answered a questiona regaurding an codeImmutableMapcode. I suggested using the Proxy pattern.p  pThe problem with this is that codeMapcode contains a codeputcode method, which would throw an codeUnsupportedOperationExceptioncode. Replacing other instances of codeMapcode with codeImmutableMapcode would break the Liskov Subsitution principle. Not only that, the need to declare codeputcode and codeputAllcode [violates the interface segregation principle]p  pTechnically, there is no way to replace a codeMapcode instance with codeImmutableMapcode, since codeMapcode is simply an interface. So my question isp  pWould creating an codeImmutableMapcode using the codeMapcode interface be considered breaking the LSP, since codeMapcode contains a codeputcode and codeputAllcode method Would not implementing codeMapcode be considered an Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces code smell How would one create an codeImmutableMapcode that abides by the LSP yet doesnt contain code smellsp

Negative 3664 pIm currently building a medical scheme type application in winforms. I have implemented a lazy loading approach to the data access.

Negative 3664 pLets assume I have a class with a datetime field, a key to a user and a simple string.p  pAs I will track all the changes to certain fields, lets assume those fields are  loggedversioned Ill probably use the StofDoctrineExtentionsBundle.p  pI need a general logger viewer to which Ill pass the field, and it will display a table with all the versions of the field value, who did it an when.p  pThe challenge is displaying the value for a string I simply get it, for a user which is in the form of a user object I might want to display Name, Surname, for a datetime Ill have to print a decent date. But the same general logger viewer would have to work for every kind of variable, so I was thinking of having something like if the value is of the type user display this, if string display that etc.... So basically I need a way to get the type. But it must be a custom type for instance the Doctrine value could be an integer, but in reality Im storing the information for an enum, e.g. Project Type [0IT, 1nonIT] so basically for each field Id have a sort of getTypefield and that would return the custom type field, and according to that Id print one thing or another.p  pHow could I do thatp  pOne way I foresee is creating the function name dynamically, so when Im trying to access the type of the attribute codeusercode, Id simply dop  precodemyEntity  ...whatever fieldName  user varFunction  get.fieldName.Type type  myEntitygtvarFunction codepre  pBut Im missing how I could call the function code above of course does not work, the creation of a function name dynamically can be done AFAIK, but I dont know how to call when its supposed to be a function inside another entity...p  pSNp

Negative 3664 pI am using z3py. I am trying to check the satisfiability for different problems  with different sizes and verify the scalability of the proposed method. However, to do that I need to know the memory consumed by the solver for each problem. Is there a way to access the memory or make the z3py print it in the STATISTICS section. Thank you so much in advance.p  pstrongUpdate2752015strongp  pI tried with the paython memory profiler but it seems that the generated memory is very large. I am not sure but the reported memory is similar to the memory consumed by the python application and not only Z3constructing the z3 model and checking the sat and then generating model. Moreover, I used formal modeling checking tools for many years now. I am expecting Z3 to be more efficient and have better scalability, however, I am getting much less memory than what the paython is generating.  What I am thinking to do is to try to measure the design size or the scalability using factors other than memory.  In z3py statistics  many details are generated to describe the design size and complexity. However, I am not able to find any explanation of these parameters in the tutorial, webpage, or z3 papers.  For example, can you help me understand the following parameters generated in the statistics for one of the basic models I have. Also is there any parameterparameters which can replace the memory or be good indication of the Z3 mdoel sizecomplexity. p  ul liaddedeqs               152li liassertlower            2li liassertupper            2li libinarypropagations     59li liconflicts               6li lidatatypeaccessorax    12li lidatatypeconstructorax 14li lidatatypeoccurscheck   19li lidatatypesplits         12li lidecisions               35li lidelclause              2li lieqadapter              2li lifinalchecks            1li limkclause               9li lioffseteqs              2li lipropagations            61li ul  pThank again for your time. p

Negative 3664 pWith Angularjs,p  pI want to hide the ngview until all XHRs have resolved. Because by default, the view will display while XHRs are still resolving. p  pThis is a problem when the XHRs are not quick example .net IIS application warmup and the screen is displayed to the user before the XHRs have resolved.p  pAn example of the issue I have a screen with select lists populated from a XHR and an anchor href string that gets built with data returned from a XHR. If the user attempts to use the select list, or click on the anchor, before the XHRs are resolved, they will get unexpected behavior. An empty select list. An anchor that doesnt work properly.p  pId rather not litter the view with ngshow or ngdisable and a bunch of flags and logic in the controller.p  pMy thought was to hide the entire ngview, until all XHRs are resolved, and then show the ngview.

Negative 3664 pA web designer friend of mine is moving a customer of hers to a new hosting provider but she wanted me to look at their email setup to make sure that nothing she was doing would affect their email. I did an assortment of MX record and dns record lookups and to me there seems to be something really strange with their mail setup. For example, there are two mx records where Im used to seeing one domain names and ip addresses are dummys just to be safe Pref 10 hostname mx.name.net ip address 111.222.555.333 and the second Pref 20 hostname mx.ct.diffname.net ip address 111.222.444.222 and neither name nor diffnam is their domain name. Then the dns entry for mail.theirdomain.net points to an address thats different from either the two addresses pointed to by the mx record.p  pI havent setup a mail server in a while but I checked the last one I did and in the mx record the hostname was mail.domainname.org and there was only one entry and the address in the mx record was the same as the address in the mail.domainname.org dns entry.p  pI could understand if there were two MX records for either load balancing or failover in case the main server went down but the setup seems strange and the fact that the mail.domainname.com dns entry doesnt point to the same address as the mx record makes me think something is setup wrong in their email system. Does anyone have some insight into thisp

Negative 3664 pIm having a problem on controlling what touch event should trigger upon touching an object. The problem is, my background has a touch function and it is overlayed by a button, when I tap the button the background also detect a touch function even though I dont want it to happen. How can I make the button only respond when I tap it, or the background only respond when I actually tap on itself.p  pits like in Corona SDK you put a return true at the bottom of your function to make the touch event only respond on the object rather than going all the way.p

Negative 3664 pI am working through the prep materials for my application to a coding bootcamp.

Negative 3664 pIve been trying to implement some custom grouping with Infragistics xamDataGrid Infragistics3.Wpf.DataPresenter.v9.1.Express, and pretty much cribbed the entire bit of code from the a hrefhttphelp.infragistics.comHelpDocWPF2011.1CLR4.0htmlInfragisticsWPF4.DataPresenter.v11.1Infragistics.Windows.DataPresenter.FieldSettingsGroupByEvaluator.html relnofollowInfragistics sitea. I have two different date fields  Due Date, and Reminder Date  using GroupByEvaluator. Everything seemed well and good until I tried to add both fields to the GroupByArea.  p  pWhat happens is this the nested field groups according to the date of the parent field as opposed to grouping of the parent field. For example, when I drag the Due Date parent field to the GroupBy, itll group these records by Due Date into four categories  Due Next Year, Due This Year, Past Due, and Not Set. Perfect. But when I drag the Reminder Date field nested to the GroupBy, Ill find multiple labels of the same Reminder Date grouping nested under Due Date Past Due. p  pIm a newbie posting to SO, so I cant post an image. Instead, Ill type one outp  ul lipPast Due Due Datep  ul liNot Set Reminder Dateli liThis Month Reminder Date  li liNot Set Reminder Date  li liOlder Reminder Date li liNot Set Reminder Date  li lietc....li ulli ul  pWith each subsequent nested grouping, the earliest Due Date value of the parent grouping is equal to or greater than the greatest Due Date of the previous grouping. It appears as though the Past Due collection is sorted by Due Date asc, and its iterating through each record and creating a new nested group whenever there is a change in the nested label. So after 5 groupByRecords are given the label of This Month, when the next Not Set groupByRecord pops up a new nested label is created instead of continuing to populate the existing one. p  pIm having a related issue with sorting, which I suspect is what this entire issue hinges on. If the grid has been sorted according to Due Date, all of the sort by functionality of the other fields are constrained by the Due Dates. For example, sorting by client name will not sort all client name records into ascending or descending. Instead, it will sort, but it sort by Due Date first, and then Name.p  pSorry I cant attach an image. Hopefully I explained the issue okay. p  pThanks in advance Code below p  precode Imports System.Collections.ObjectModel  Imports Infragistics.Windows.DataPresenter  Imports System.Windows  Imports System.Windows.Controls   Partial Public Class ManageEntities  Public Sub New       This call is required by the designer.
