But problem arises when I codesynccode my map with new values  every time it refreshes the whole map.p  pIf anyone has any insight on how to achieve this effect of being able to run the android app and see the marker dynamically change, it would be much appreciatedp  precodepublic class userpage extends FragmentActivity implements OnMapReadyCallback  double longi0,lati0 int id0 MapFragment mapFragment public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState      setContentViewR.layout.tim      try             mapFragment  MapFragment getFragmentManager                 .findFragmentByIdR.id.map           catchException e              Log.derror,e.toString          final Handler h  new Handler     h.postDelayednew Runnable           Override         public void run               TODO Autogenerated method stub              new logincheck.execute                  Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext,longi    longi  latii   lati,Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show             h.postDelayedthis, 10000              , 10000      Override public void onMapReadyGoogleMap googleMap        LatLng current  new LatLnglongi, lati      googleMap.moveCameraCameraUpdateFactory.newLatLngZoomcurrent, 13      googleMap.addMarkernew MarkerOptions             .titleid             .positioncurrent      end of class userpage  public class logincheck extends AsyncTaskltString, Void, Stringgt         HashMapltString, Stringgt data     ArrayListltHashMapltString, Stringgtgt dataFromdb      public logincheck              dataFromdb  new ArrayListltHashMapltString, Stringgtgt            Override     protected String doInBackgroundString... params          id  getIntent.getIntExtraid,0         StringBuilder result  new StringBuilder         String line           HttpClient client  new DefaultHttpClient         HttpGet httpget  new HttpGetmylinkid id          try                      HttpResponse responce  client.executehttpget             BufferedReader in  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderresponce.getEntity.getContent             whileline in.readLine  null                              result.appendline                          in.close                  catchException e                      Log.eerror in do in background, e.getMessage                   return result.toString            protected void onPostExecuteString result          ArrayListltHashMapltString, Stringgtgt mydata  parseJsonresult         forint i0i lt mydata.sizei                      longi  Double.parseDoublemydata.geti.getlogi             lati  Double.parseDoublemydata.geti.getlati                   try              mapFragment.getMapAsyncuserpage.this                  catchException e                      Log.derror,e.toString                     private ArrayListltHashMapltString, Stringgtgt parseJsonString stringdata              dataFromdb.clear         try                        JSONArray jsonarray  new JSONArraystringdata             JSONObject jsondata  null              forint i0iltjsonarray.lengthi                              NumberFormat n  NumberFormat.getInstance                 data  new HashMapltString, Stringgt                 jsondata  jsonarray.getJSONObjecti                 data.putlogi,jsondata.getStringlogi                 data.putlati,jsondata.getStringlati                  dataFromdb.adddata                                catchJSONException e                      Log.eerror in parsing ,e.getMessage                   return dataFromdb          codepre

It drops markers and on clicking those markers it shows an info box from which I can jump to that controller and start editing the place.p  precode RouteBoxer functions function routefrom, to, url     Clear any previous route boxes from the map    ifdebug     clearBoxes     Convert the distance to box around the route from miles to km   distance  parseFloatdistance    var request       origin from,     destination to,     travelMode google.maps.DirectionsTravelMode.DRIVING        Make the directions request   var test  directionService.routerequest, functionresult, status       if status  google.maps.DirectionsStatus.OK        directionsRenderer.setDirectionsresult         Box around the overview path of the first route       var path  result.routes[0].overviewpath       var boxes  routeBoxer.boxpath, distance       ifdebug         drawBoxesboxes        forkey in boxes                    var swLat  boxes[key].getSouthWest.lat           var swLng  boxes[key].getSouthWest.lng           var neLat  boxes[key].getNorthEast.lat           var neLng  boxes[key].getNorthEast.lng            ifisNaNswLat  isNaNswLng  isNaNneLat isNaNneLng              .ajax               url url,               type POST,               dataType json,               data                  swLat swLat,                 swLng swLng,                 neLat neLat,                 neLng neLng               ,                          .donefunction data                 dropMarkersdata               console.logmarkers.length                          .failfunction                console.log error                           .alwaysfunction                console.log complete                                        else        alertDirections query failed   status          codepre  pThe dropMarkers basically setMarkers in the map and also adds it to an array variables codevar markers  []code. I want some code to execute once all markers have been dropped but strangely Im not able to figure out how to do this. I tried putting an codealertAll markers dropped, No. of markers  markers.lengthcode at the end of the for loop but it executes early before the markers have been dropped and displays 0. I even tried putting this at the last before line of the this route function, and it gave the same behaviour. The codeconsole.logmarkers.lengthcode however works and shows me progressively that the markers array is getting filled so Im looking for a way to call a function when the last set of markers are dropped.p  pI read another stack overflow answer and tried this code in my init block.p  precodegoogle.maps.event.addListenerdirectionsRenderer, directionschanged,function    ifthis.getdirections      alertAll markers dropped, No. of markers  markers.length        codepre  pThis too executes prematurely and shows 0 markers i.e. before the markers are even dropped. How to call a function after all the markers have been dropped Thanksp

Positive 1819 pIm clustering markers on a Google map in Android using the clustering from a hrefhttpsgithub.comgooglemapsandroidmapsutils relnofollowandroidmapsutilsa. I want to disable the clustering when the map is at its max zoom level ie always render individual ClusterItems if the map is at max zoom level, otherwise cluster as normal.p  pIm able to almost get it working by doing a test for zoom level in shouldRenderAsCluster in a custom class extending DefaultClusterRenderer. However my solution lags one step behind the actual zoom level. For instance if the max zoom for the map is level 21, and the user zooms in from level 20 to level 21, the check in shouldRenderAsCluster will get a current zoom level of 20. If the user then zooms out to level 20 the check will get level 21. The ClusterItems gets rendered as individual items like I want, but one zoom action too late.p  pI get the Current Zoom which is not really current apparently from the variable mZoom that is set in DefaultClusterRenderer.p  pThis is the codep  precodepublic class UserClusterRenderer extends PosMapDefaultClusterRendererltUserClusterItemgt        ...

Because they have private access there Ive made a copy of DefaultClusterRenderer called PosMapDefaultClusterRenderer. The only difference is that mZoom and mMap are declared protected instead so theyre accessible in UserClusterRenderer.p  pWhy is mZoom lagging one zoom action behind Is there a way to get the real zoom level for which the clusters are being renderedp  pThe zooming is done with a call to animateCamera using a cameraUpdate from a cameraPosition.p  pAlso this is my first question on StackOverflow so any input on tags, formatting etc is welcome.p

Negative 1819 pIm working on a clientserver solution that uses .NET 2.0 Remoting server activation, binary formatting over TCP channel, Vista Ultimate for communication purposes. Currently Im profiling the application and run everything on the same machine. I noticed that if I start the application, everything works just fine for several minutes and then suddenly each remote call takes several seconds to execute. I have logging on both ends and clock every call. Server sides implementation takes only fraction of a second to execute, while the whole remote call is slow.

Negative 1819 pNote in this question, I am talking about formal Interfaces e.g. public interface IButton ... . p  pIm an Actionscript developer, but I suspect my question will resonate in many languages that allow both formal Interfaces and Events. p  pI love Interfaces. I love the separation between interface and implementation. I wish Actionscript forced every class to implement a formal Interface, the way ObjectiveC does. All of my classes implement an interface or several, and youll never find me writing a public method than isnt referenced in an Interface.p  pBut Actionscript is also heavily dependent on Events. My problem is this every part of a class that communicates with external classes or processes is or should be part of its Interface. I realize this is a matter of opinion. If you disagree, this question will probably be meaningless to you.p  pThere are several ways to muddy this clear picture, but most of them are avoidablep  ol lipYou cant list public properties in an Interface. Solution dont use public properties in your classes. Use getters and setters instead and Im not all that crazy about them, either, but I use them when I must.pli lipIf classes communicate by passing arguments to constructors, those messages bypass Interfaces, since you cant list a constructor function in an Interface. I avoid this problem by almost never passing parameters through constructors. I prefer init methods that can be made explicit in Interfaces.pli lipClasses can have public methods that arent listed in an Interface. I avoid this by not doing it. My classes implement Interfaces. Those Interfaces contain headers for ALL public methods.pli lipMany classes dispatch Events.pli ol  pThat last one is the killer.p  pLets say I give you a class called Blah, and you ask me how to use it. I can tell you, It implements the IBlah Interface. Just look at that and youll see everything you can do with Blah.p  pExcept Blah extends EventDispatcher, which implies that it dispatches Events.p  pWhat Events does it dispatch You ask.p  pUh...p  pTo know, you have to check the JavaDoc or read through Blahs source code. You shouldnt have to do either You should be able to know how to interact with a class by checking its Interfaces. p  pI wish Interfaces could look like thisp  precodepublic interface IBlah      function foo  void     function bar  Boolean     event BlahEvent  codepre  pBut you cant specify events in an Interface.p  pAm I right that Events break Interfaces To me, its as if I gave you a car and said heres the manual. In the manual, it supposedly explains everything thats on the dashboard. But then, when youre driving the car, weird dohickies appear and strange sounds play  Events that arent mentioned in the manual.p  pIf Im wrong, please explain.p  pIf Im right, is there a good way to avoid the problemp

Negative 1819 pIm trying to filter the User list in Django using a UserProfile Field... I need to implement a queue system where new users are put in a queue until an Admin approves them.p  pI simply added a codeisinqueuecode boolean field to my UserProfile model... However, when displaying the user list in my Admin area, I realized that you cant filter the list using a Models foreign key field in this case, a field of UserProfilep  pApparently, codelistdisplaycode items can be callables but codelistfiltercode cant, so I can list IF a user is in the queue without a problem, but the admin would have to scroll through the whole user list to spot which ones are in the queue which makes no sense... Filtering only users that are in the queue using userprofile.inqueue would be much more practical...p  pFinally, I thought about adding a custom view to my admin area that would list only the user in the queue, but that custom view does not show up on the Admin area Index page, and putting together a whole new AdminSite only for a new filtering option seems a bit over the top...p  pSo basically to sum it up Can I filter my User list based on a  UserProfile field If not, can I add a custom view thats accessible  from the front page without having to create a completely new  AdminSite only for that  p

Negative 1819 pIm creating an STA version of the strongSynchronizationContextstrong for use in Windows Workflow 4.0.  Im wondering what to do about exceptions when Posting callbacks.p  pThe emSynchronizationContextem can be used to strongSendstrong execute synchronously or strongPoststrong execute asynchronously delegates of type strongSendOrPostCallbackstrong.  Although in both cases I invoke the delegate on a STA thread, its easy to know how to handle exceptions when executing synchronously.  I block the calling thread, Invoke the callback on my worker thread, record any exceptions, unblock the calling thread, and throw any recorded exceptions on the calling thread.p  pWhat I should do on the asynchronous strongPoststrong is less clear.  There is no mechanism for transferring that exception from the executing thread back to the calling thread strongPoststrong is 100 fire and forget.  There is no emEndInvokeem or emWaitHandleem in the  strongSendOrPostCallbackstrong.  Any exceptions thrown will result in the application being torn down.p  pDo I have no choice but to let an exception thrown in a strongPoststrong tear down my application  That seems to be the default behavior in the emSynchronizationContextsem in the framework thank you, Reflector.  I cant seem to figure out why this is.  Shouldnt there be strongsomestrong way to prevent asynchronous strongPoststrongs from going boomp

Negative 1819 pI just read this a hrefhttpmanfredlange.blogspot.com200903implicittypingcanmaketddharder.html relnofollowposta and it makes the case against implicit typing using when starting out with Test driven developmentdesign.p  pHis post says that TDD can be slowed down when using implicit typing for the return type when unit testing a method. Also, he seems to want the return type specified by the test in order to drive development which makes sense to me.p  pA given unit test with implicit typing might look like thisp  precodepublic void TestSomeMethod      MyClass myClass  new MyClass      var result  myClass.MethodUnderTest     Assert.AreEqualsomeCondition, result  codepre  pSo my questions arep  pDoes using implicit typing help or hinder writing unit tests for TDD Is there anyone out there that can share their experience using this technique when writing unit tests p  pI ask this because soon I have not done TDD and want to know if there is a way to write generic or semigeneric unit tests that would work a return type might change.p

Negative 1819 pSome time back in the nineties, Microsoft introduced the Windows Registry. Applications could store settings in different hives.

Am I doing something incorrectlyp  pAlso, I should point out that I have this code for the call to gameType which lives in the Settings classp  precode GamePlayTypegameType      return [dao gameType]  codepre  pand the DAO implements gameType like thisp  precode intgameType      return settingsContent  nil  [[settingsContent objectForKeyGame Type] intValue]  0  codepre  pI know I have the DAO returning an int instead of a GamePlayType, but A the problem I am describing arose there when I tried to use the proper data type, and B I did not think it would matter since the enum is just a bunch of named ints, rightp  pAny help, greatly appreciated.  I really want to understand this thoroughly, and something is eluding me...p  pCheers,p  pChrisp

I also have access to the exact executable that created the minidumps.p  pI found a nifty little application called ChkMatch that can make .pdbs match an executable... the only difference according to ChkMatch was age, so I matched my newer .pdbs to the original executable.p  pHowever, when I load it in WinDbg, it still says that it is a mismatched pdb then, since I had set code.symopts0x40code it tries to load them anyway.  I then get the warningp  precode WARNING Unable to verify checksum for myexe.exe codepre  pI ran codelmi myexecode and saw that, indeed, the checksum of the executable was in fact zero. From poking around a bit, Ive found that the executable should have been built with the codereleasecode flag to have a checksum.

Some of our users are using g 4.4.3, others 4.3.3, and still others 4.2.1.

Negative 1819 pWhen you create a LiveWallpaper in Android 2.2 you get a canvas or whatever the 3D equivalent is to draw on. Id like to draw some elements using the builtin Android UI tools rather than building everything from scratch using canvas commands or a loading a prerendered UI bitmap.p  pConverting a single View to a Bitmap works fine. i.e. this works greatp  precode For example this works TextView view  new TextViewctx view.layout0, 0, 200, 100 view.setTexttest Bitmap b  Bitmap.createBitmap 200, 100, Bitmap.Config.ARGB8888                 Canvas tempC  new Canvasb view.drawtempC c.drawBitmapb, 200, 100, mPaint codepre  pBut, converting a LinearLayout with children causes problems. You emonlyem get the LinearLayout itself and none of its children. For example, if I set the LinearLayout to have a white background I get a nicely rendered white box, but none of the TextView children are in the Bitmap. Ive also tried using DrawingCache with similar results. p  pThe code Im using is the cube example with the only changes being an extra draw command. The LinearLayout works fine as a toast or as a regular view i.e. everything nicely shows up, on the LiveWallpaper all I get is the LinearLayouts background rendered.p  precodeinflater  LayoutInflatergetApplicationContext.getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE layout  LinearLayout inflater.inflatecom.example.android.livecubes.R.layout.testLinearLayout, null layout.layout0, 0, 400, 200  Bitmap b  Bitmap.createBitmap 400, 200, Bitmap.Config.ARGB8888 Canvas tempC  new Canvasb layout.drawtempC c.drawBitmapb, 10, 200, mPaint codepre  pDoes anyone know if you need to do anything special to get the children rendered properly to my bitmap i.e. do I need to somehow do something special to make the layout render the rest of the children Should I write a function to recursively do something to all the childrenp  pI could composite everything myself but, since the display is fairly static i.e. I draw this once and keep a copy of the bitmap to draw on the background this seems easier on me and still pretty efficient.p  pstrongEditstrong While digging a bit more into the state of the Layout it looks as though the layout is not progressing down the view tree i.e. the LinearLayout gets its layout computed when I call layout but the children have a null 0x0 size. According to the Romain Guys post in 2008 a hrefhttpgroups.google.comgroupandroiddevelopersbrowsethreadthread8318671d0313024e32c50aff962e0a2 relnofollowandroid developer posta. You have to wait for the layout pass or force the layout yourself. The problem is how can I wait for a layout pass from a wall paper engine for a LinearLayout that is not attached to the root view group And how can I manually layout each child element if layout requires you to set the left, top, right, bottom when I dont know what these should be.p  pIve tried calling forceLayout on the children but it doesnt seem to help either. Im not sure how the layout framework works behind the scenes besides that it does a two pass layout. Is there a way to manually make it do the layout pass, i.e. right now Since its not an Activity I dont think a lot of the normal background stuff is happening quite the way Id like.p

Negative 1819 pI am writing embedded code for MSP430, using the IAR compiler at the highest optimization level speed or size does not change anything.p  pI define a function as static, then reference it only once, in the same file. Since the function has internal linkage, and is used exactly once, I expected the optimizer to perform inline expansion. I can see no reason not to.p  pThe function is short, it results in 16 words of machine code. It is called from an ISR. Adding the inline keyword makes the function inline, but the optimizer seems to need the hint. Having it inline saves two codepushcodecodepopcodes to the stack, one codecallacode and one coderetacode.p  pAm I right to expect inline expansion to be performed even without the codeinlinecode keyword, or am I missing somethingp  hr  pstrongEditstrong a few more tests showed that the inline expansion was dependent on the size of the function, and that the threshold was quite low. It seems to be around 15 or 16 words of machine code. Above that and the optimizer does not expand if not given the keyword.p  pI still dont see why it wouldnt readability shouldnt be the concern of an optimizer, should it, but I understand that IAR only can answer this.p

I also notice that the title of the parent page notepads.htm is not the title set in the iframe logically this is correct  but another issue I need to solve if I go ahead and use this method.p  pCan anyone suggest another way I could do this, or tell me whether I am going along the right lines by using iframes Thanks.p  pRegards,p  pRichardp  pPS If this is the wrong name for what I am trying to do then please let me know what it actually is so I can rename  retag it.p

Negative 1819 pI have a couple of custom entities, which are linked together with a many to many relationship, using a linking entity which contains some linking attributes. For the sake of clarity lets call these Superhero and Supervillain, and the link will be Fight.p  precodeSuperhero 1   Fight   1 Supervillain codepre  pThat is, each fight is between 1 superhero and 1 supervillain, and each superherosuppervillain combo can have any number of fights maybe of different type  sword, fist, etc.p  pAll simple stuff so far. Effectively, what Im doing here is reproducting the new Connections functionality, but using a custom linking type that only works with Superheros and Supervillains. The reason for this is I want to show these as a separate navigation item in the left hand side of the form, rather than lump them all in under Connections.p  pNow, from the Superhero form, when I look at the related entities in the left hand pane, I want to show a see a list of the Fights, along with the Supervillain that the Superhero was fighting. Simple enough, I can just customise the Fight Associated View to show the type of Fight, and the Supervillain entity. This lets me click straight through from the Superhero to the Supervillain he was fighting.p  pBut how about if I want to do the same from Supervillain The same Fight Associated View is shown for Supervillains as well, but needs to be customised to show the fight type and the related Superhero... But, I dont want a one size fits all associated view, with both Superhero and Supervillain fields.p  pI want the associated view to change according to whether Im looking at a Superhero or a Supervillain. So I create two new views, each with the desired columns. I can now emmanuallyem switch to these view when selecting the related list in each entity. This works fine, but I dont want this manual step every time I look at the Related fights.p  pSo, finally I get to the point of the strongquestionstrong How can I automatically i.e. through script, if necessary select the default Associated view that will be shown for the Fights related to Superheros and Supervillains, dependent on the entity typep  pUsing form script, I can get the navigation item easily enough, but after that I am lostp  precodefunction SuperHeroOnLoad      var fightItem  Xrm.Page.ui.navigation.items.getnavnewfight      What next     fightItem.MagicFunctionThatSelectsADefaultViewOrHacksIntoTheIframeParametersOrSomething  codepre  pstrongNotestrong I know I can use a subgrid in the main edit form, which lets you choose the view to display, but I dont want to clog the form up with more subgrids.

I am facing this problem only on windows 7 both x86 and x64. No issues with XP both x86 and x64. p  pI compared logs on xp and win7.

Our product supports both upgrades and downgrades. To make as simple as possible for clients, we choose REINSTALLAll REINSTALLMODEvamus , so that these options supports for both upgrade and downgrade. Another important point is, this MSI doesnt have separate upgrade or downhrade information. MSI had plane components. All the components inside MSI are signed. Version information also embedded.  My questions are  1 does windows installer behavior changed on win7  2 does installer takes only a.b.c as version information will it ignore after that  p  pAnother important point is, this MSI doesnt have separate upgrade or downhrade information. MSI had plane components. REINSTALLAll REINSTALLMODEvamus parameters ensures that always running msi version components goes to install directory. So far this method works for almost 5 years. Only win7 had problem. p  pTo reproduce this problem...  1 install 1.2.2.2 by msiexec i 1.2.2.2.msi  2 downgrade to 1.2.2.1 had no issues msiexec i 1.2.2.1.msi REINSTALLALL REINSTALLMODEvamus  3 upgrade to 1.2.2.2 causes problem msiexec i 1.2.2.2.msi REINSTALLALL REINSTALLMODEvamus 4 retry to upgrade again to 1.2.2.2 . This time no issues.p  pAnother observation is, one of the component in MSI say comp1 had 2 files say file1, file2. File1 is keypath to the component comp1.  at the time of problem comes step 3, file1 is not getting updated. But file2 is updating properly.p  panother observation. I ran above test on different different versions.p  p upgradedowngrade between 1.2.1.1 and 1.2.2.1 working as expected  upgradedowngrade between 1.2.1.1 and 1.2.1.2 is not working as expected  upgradedowngrade between 1.2.2.1 and 1.2.2.2 is not working as expectedp  pas mentioned above windows installer is considering version up to a.b.c.  Upgradedowngrade between a.b.c.x and a.b.c.y is causing problem on windows7p

Negative 1819 pThe problem is it seems, is if the operation that updates a TextBox for example, with the propertys value that it is bound to. If that property takes too long to produce said value the thread that is updating the textboxs value kills itself Im not sure on this, just assuming. This is causing me some issues with garbage collection and unmanaged code.p  pWhat I think is happening is the update thread dies and then my references to the unmanaged code are garbage collected, but the unmanaged code then executes but the object sent in from my managed code have been destroyed causing a fatal exception in my unmanaged code.p  pHere is the warning associated with this problem A callback was made on a garbage collected delegate of type .... This may cause application crashes, corruption and data loss.

Negative 1819 pMy game called Clear the Square has gotten approved. Its getting hundreds of downloads. Its currently 44 in free word games in the US. There is only one problem when I go to the Game Center leaderboards, it shows two users, one of them being me. And one of them being very appropriately named someone who isnt me. Here is a screenshot of what this looks like a hrefhttpclearthesquareapp.comphoto9.PNG relnofollowhttpclearthesquareapp.comphoto9.PNGap  pI know that there are more than two people playing this iAd tells me so. I also know that the game is not unwinnable somewhat challenging, but not unwinnable. And I know that Game Center didnt just completely go out of style overnight. In all other games that have ever been anywhere near a top100 list, there are at least a few hundred alltime scores on the leaderboard.p  pThinking that the problem might be that my development build is somehow special and goes to an alternate, sandbox set of leaderboards, I deleted the binary from my phone, rebooted my phone, and downloaded the game from the App Store. Same thing. So that wasnt the problem.p  pHeres all my GameCenter code it comes straight from example projects. I dont know what could be missing, since it does successfully authenticate, it does show leaderboards, and it does post my score  each time I set a high score, it is instantly reflected in the leaderboard.p  pI would really, really appreciate it if someone could download the free version of my game, and send me a screenshot of what the leaderboards look like on your end. You would definitely get promo codes for every future app I make.p  precode void authenticateLocalPlayer         GKLocalPlayer localPlayer  [GKLocalPlayer localPlayer]       [localPlayer authenticateWithCompletionHandlerNSError error        if localPlayer.isAuthenticated              NSLogauthenticated in game center       Perform additional tasks for the authenticated player.              ]     void reportScore int64t score forCategory NSString category        GKScore scoreReporter  [[[GKScore alloc] initWithCategorycategory] autorelease]      scoreReporter.value  score        [scoreReporter reportScoreWithCompletionHandlerNSError error           if error  nil                         handle the reporting error                ]     void showLeaderboard              GKLeaderboardViewController leaderboardController  [[GKLeaderboardViewController alloc] init]         if leaderboardController  nil                      leaderboardController.leaderboardDelegate  self             [self presentModalViewController leaderboardController animated YES]                 void leaderboardViewControllerDidFinishGKLeaderboardViewController viewController      [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedYES]  codepre  pThere should be more than two players on this leaderboard. What am I missingp  pEdit also, worth noting that it has already been out for about 48 hours, and probably has about 1000 downloads so far.

Negative 1819 pLets say I am dealing with an xsdsimpleType that is a string, needs to be of a certain character set and of a specific maximum length, similar to the below code  p  precodeltxsdsimpleType nameMyTypegt     ltxsdrestriction basexsdstringgt     ltxsdpattern value[09] gt     ltxsdmaxLength value36 gt     ltxsdrestrictiongt ltxsdsimpleTypegt   codepre  pSo my xsd type will be a string of only digits and maximum of 36 characters. My question is whether the xsdpattern and xsdmaxLength or any other similar tag like minLength can work together. My intuition is no either pattern or lengthbased xsd elements only in the xsdrestriction. Therefore, I would have to add the max length restriction into the pattern.  p  pPlease note that I did test this out by unmarshalling an xml on Java and the validation failed. Regardless, what I am looking for is information as two how and whether pattern and maxLength can work together.p

Negative 1819 pI have found a few articles online about debugging Yii PHP applications either locally or remotely. All the examples I can find are either the code and server are local which is easy to setup, or all code is remote which wasnt able to work for me.p  pBasically all my code lives locally through an NFS file mount on a remote server, which runs apache. On the remote server redhat I have XDebug setup and installed with php5, but locally Mac Snow Leopard is my code and I dont have a web server setup. I am currently using PHPStorm as my IDE and at home this environment is at work I can setup debugging fine with apache Ubuntu. But I cannot seem to get anything to work when trying to do this remotely at work and was hoping the brains here might be able to help me out.p

Negative 1819 pI am using XElement to manipulate my xml file to find target node and then add child node to it. But now I have one problem. Lets say my xml file looks like thisp  precodeltReport xmlnsMYNAMESPACE   ltWidthgt100ltWidthgt   ltHeightgt100ltHeightgt   ltReportItemsgt     ltReportItemgt ... ltReportgt codepre  pAnd I want to add a new codeltReportItemgtcode to the codeltReportItemsgtcode node using VB.NET. In this link a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb387082.aspx relnofollowHow to Create a Document with Namespaces LINQ to XML Visual Basica it says that in order to declare and use namespaces, it needs to Imports them at the beginning of a fileit is different from C usage. So I do codeImports ltxmlnsMYNAMESPACEgtcode. Now I need to 1 find the codeltReportItemsgtcode node at first, and 2 add my new node. In order to do the first step, I triedp  precodeDim xmldoc  XDocument.LoadMYXMLFILEPATH Dim target  xmldoc.Root.ElementsMYNAMESPACE amp ReportItems.FirstOrDefault codepre  pAnd to do step 2, I didp  precodeDim newNode As XElement       ltReportItemgt target.AddnewNode codepre  pNow there is the problem if I dont specify the codeMYNAMESPACEcode when I query the Root element, I cant find codeReportItemscode at all. It is because the string is actually used to implicitly construct a XName object god knows why I cant assign the NS to XName object explicitly, and this object is used to search. If I dont give the curly brackets part, it will search within empty namespace, so it cant find the codeltReportItemsgtcodenode which is in MYNAMESPACE. But if I give this curly brackets namespace, the final xml file will look like thisp  precodeltReport xmlnsMYNAMESPACE   ltWidthgt100ltWidthgt   ltHeightgt100ltHeightgt   ltReportItemsgt     ltReportItemgt     ltReportItem xmlnsMYNAMESPACEgt     ... ltReportgt codepre  pThe second codeltReportItemgtcode is the newlyadded one, but sadly this is not a valid file my parser is complaining in the further processing of xml file. So how can I make this new item look exactly like the existing one, without any namespace This has been driving me crazy. I spent a whole day to figure out that I need to add the curly brackets so that it will find the target node it doesnt work like what the link above says that it adds and searches the default NS automatically, but now it adds something unnecessary Its gotta be kidding mep

Negative 1819 pWe have been working with Entity Spaces and everything was working great on our local development machines until we started using SqlServer for our Session management. Our hosting service ITech has a server farm so it is imperative that we get this working against SqlServer for the session management.p  pThe issue that we are seeing is on the save of objects that were placed into session and then later retrieved. The rowstate for the objects are getting reset to invalid instead of added etc. We contacted Entity Spaces for assistance and their advice was to use their serialization method to convert the objects into a string and then placing the string into the session. When we attempted this, the primary object was being serialized properly but it did not attempt to serialize any child objects in the object graph. For instance, a loan object with a list of borrowers hanging off of it. The loan itself would be serialized but not the borrowers list.p  pIf I serialized manually to binary and store that into the session, the entire object graph is there but now we are back to the rowstate not being set properly. I decided to work around this by creating my own rowstate property called Status. I then would set the Status property to the objects rowstate just before I serialized to binary. Then I would flip the rowstate from invalid to whatever Status was set to when I deserialized the object. This all looked right in the debugger but, when I told it to save, Entity Spaces did not create the right SQL.  It tried to save without the values of the properties of the entity.p  pHas anyone else attempted this and if so, did you find a solutionp

Negative 1819 pi am pretty new to the iOS world and since Im coming from the Activitybased world of Android Im a little bit confused with how iOS manages transitions between Views.p  pI already created a UIViewController which displays a Login form in full screen Its an app targeted for the iPad. After a successful login I want to switch to another View and utilize a UISplitViewController. To be able to push from my initial controller to the second which is also a UIViewController Ive already added an UINavigationController with my first controller being the root.p  pIve added the UISplitViewController to the xib of my second UIViewController. Xcode previously complained that my second UIViewController didnt have the view outlet set, so I basically blindly set that to the detailView within my UISplitViewController.p  pThe result is that the first UIViewController gets indeed pushed away but I dont get the UISplitViewController to show up but the DetailView I have set in the view outlet. p  pDid I miss something What is necessary to first display a full screen nothing fancy, no frills UISplitViewController and then push over to UISplitViewController My previous attempts involed the new Storyboard feature but that turned out to be even more confusing ie. too much magic involved. Maybe I just got some of the UI paradigms of iOS wrong.p

Im guessing the former is based on sales data, and the other is based on catalog data, such as category, attributes, etc.p  pDoes anyone know how Amazon or other similar large retail companies pull these recommended products onto their product pages Is it done on the fly or done at certain intervals I cant decide which way it should be done at this time. Im leaning toward the latter, because the algorithm can be more intricate, but Im guessing this will need to be processed and updated at certain interval to minimize page load times.p  pAny comments from programmer who have worked on this type of project are welcomep

Negative 1819 pI am working on some code that impliments various features such as a PID controller, signal generator, etc.p  pMy hardware provides various inputs and outputs.  Just now I have a load of SWITCH statement to determine the source and destination of my calculations.p  pFor example for the PID controller, there is a switch command every 100ms that decides which input to pass to the pidcalculate function, followed by another switch to decide what to do with the return value.  As I have 32 analog inputs, as well as can, lin and serial as possible inputs, the switch statements are HUGEp  pI would like to reference to, or a physical example of how something could be coded as a hardware independent within the confines of the pic function.  I am sure that the answer lies with pointers, but I am new to C and not really sure where to begin with the pointers.p  pI envisage the function prototype being something like     int pidinitsource,destination Where the source is a pointer to the input, eg an ADC buffer, and the destination could be for example the pwm duty cycle register.  Just now I have to switch each possible condition then load the data into the registers.p  pSo to clarify, how would I impliment a function that allows it to be input and output independent, and how would I dereference the pointersassuming pointers are the correct way to do thisp  pI hope this makes sense, thanks in advance.p

Each time it calls a specific method, I would like to output that it has done so, which I would like to save to a file for later analysis.p  pFor example, I am trying to better understand the flow within KVM an open source hypervisor but there are obviously many lines of code, and would be impossible for me to know where the code goes unless I dedicated possibly weeks to finding out. p  pThe code I am looking at is written mostly in C, but also uses other languages.

Also, it would appear that the beginning of the data codea11code describes an array with a length of 11. While this is similar to standard Bencode, it doesnt seem to use the standard syntax that Bencode uses.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas what type of encoding this is Is this a nonstandard Bencode format, or something entirely different Im looking for a parser in PHP or Python, and having a name for the encoding would definitely help in my search.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1819 pIm trying to modify the executable contents of my own ELF files to see if this is possible. I have written a program that reads and parses ELF files, searches for the code that it should update, changes it, then writes it back after updating the shsize field in the section header.p  pHowever, this doesnt work. If I simply exchange some bytes, with other bytes, it works. However, if I change the size, it fails. Im aware of that some shoffsets are immediately adjacent to each other however this shouldnt matter when Im emreducingem the size of the executable code.p  pOf course, there might be a bug in my program or more than one, but Ive already painstakingly gone through it.p  pInstead of asking for help with debugging my program Im just wondering, is there anything else than the shsize field I need to update in order to make this work when reducing the size Is there anything that would make changing the length fail other than that fieldp  pEditp  pIt seems that Andy Ross was perfectly correct. Even in this very simple program I have come across some indirect addressing in libcstartmain that I cannot trivially modify to update the offset it will reach.p  pI was curious though, what would be the best approach to still trying to get as far as possible with this problem I know I cannot solve this in every case, but for some simple programs, it should be possible to update what is required to make it run Should I try writing my own virtual machine or try developing a debugger that would replace each suspected problem instruction with INT 3 Any ideasp

Negative 1819 pWe all have seen in Google, that if we type a query, and make a typo, Google suggests a saner version of the query which is correct more often than not. Now how do they do it One possible way I can think of is find out all other strings at an edit distance of 1 from the given string, and if any on of them returns a string with a higher value searched attribute might come from backend DB, where each indexed query term has a weight associated with it based on how frequently that term crops up in queries than the given string, that string is suggested.

Negative 1819 pIve got an interactive command line program that well call program.exe.  While its running, I can type in a bunch of different commands that do different things.  Well call them doA, doB, doC, and quit.  Now, as it turns out, the first thing I want to do in program.exe is emalwaysem doA.  Id like to save a few keystrokes and automatically have program.exe run the command doA upon startup.  Unfortunately, I cant just pass doA on the command line because whoever created program.exe didnt implement that feature.p  pThe way I see it, I have a few optionsp  ul lipWrite another program that calls program.exe, writes doA to its stdin, then hooks its own stdin to program.exes stdin and hooks program.exes sdtout to its own stdout.  This will probably work, but Id like to see if theres a solution that doesnt require a compilerpli lipUse some batch file magic to jam doA into program.exes stdin.  This is the part that Ive got questions about.

Echo is hogging up program.exes stdinp  pcodemore  echo doA  program.execodep  pThis also works and gets a little closer to what Im after.  program.exe executes doA and I see the output from doA.  I can also type in additional commands, but I dont see the output from these commands.  Furthermore, when I send the quit command, program.exe terminates I guess, but Im still stuck in the more command and I can keep typing lines until I hit ctrlc.p  pThe Question  Is there another way to do what Im trying to do with a bat file  Conceptually, I think I need to combine two streams the keyboard, and the literal doA into one and pass that into program.exe, but I could be way off.p

Negative 1819 pTo preface, I realize this is a very highlevel question but Im looking for input on how to best architect the solutions rather than how to implement it.p  pWhat I have so far is as followsp  ol liSince we use multiple tracking vendors, each vendors tracking code is wrapped in an object that standardizes the tracking methods. The idea is that no matter which tracking vendor is used certain methods are always available to be called, rendering the vendors essentially interchangeably.li liEvery vendor wrapper accepts a tracking rules object that provides instructions on what to track and when. emFor example the tracking rules object includes an onDOMReady, onFormSubmit and onDOMChange method that is executed at the appropriate time.emli ol  pWhat I am currently struggling with is the best approach when it comes to collecting data on the events. In the past the rules object had always gathered data the following waysp  ul liParsing the current URL embased on the known URL structureem.li liScraping the DOM for the values in tags emlike the h1 or titleem and attributes emlike form nameemli liDigging through the various instantiated JS objects in search of other data. emFor example pulling a users id from user.current.id.emli ul  pThis has been useful in the past as it allowed tracking to perform behind the scenes. Of course the collection methods above all required people to be careful what they change as seemingly safe to change object and DOM structures can have a dramatic affect on tracking. With a lot of different people contributing to the code were looking for a better way to handle data collection.p  pSome ideas that have surfaced arep  ul liUse data binds to store all tracking information in the DOM. This has the advantage of being transparent, but the disadvantage of leading to verbosity. In addition, if used exclusively itll require data that only exists in JS objects to be transferred to the DOM.li liContinue to use our nonintrusive methods, but write more extensive unit tests. emThis is a nobrainer, but Id love to pair this with a cleaner data collection process, to make it a less daunting taskemli ul  pAre there any best practices, philosophies or suggestions that may helpp

Negative 1819 pIve searched the web and couldnt find a good answer to this question, so Im praying you guys do. So Im opening this up to any discussion related to the topic. Thanks.p  h2Objectiveh2  pWhat Im trying to do is create an app that allows the user to store data from their fishing trips. This includes storing fish species type Bass, Trout, etc.., several other string variables and also a strongcollection of related imagesstrong. The user may also link images to their tackle box inventory, favorite fishing spots, fish species generic photos, and more. As one might expect, after some time, their may be hundreds of photos being referenced by this app. So to keep allowing for fast loading of activities and smooth processing, how should I store these imagesp  h2Questionh2  pSo how do I storereference hundreds of images that are I guess uploaded into the app. The ideal way would be to have a server that keeps all user data however, for now, Im short on funds and looking for the next most efficienteffective way to do this.p  pHere is my RelatedMedia class right now.p  precode ltsummarygt  RelatedMedia  Stores photo and video information.  ltsummarygt  [Serializable] public class RelatedMedia  ISerializable      region Components     private Listltbyte[]gt nattachedPhotos     endregion      region General Constructors     public RelatedMedia              this.nattachedPhotos  new Listltbyte[]gt           public RelatedMediaListltbyte[]gt attachedPhotos              this.nattachedPhotos  attachedPhotos          endregion      region Properties     public Listltbyte[]gt AttachedPhotos              get                      return this.nattachedPhotos                  set                      this.nattachedPhotos  value                   endregion      region Serializing Methods     Deserialization constructor.     public RelatedMediaSerializationInfo info, StreamingContext ctxt              this.nattachedPhotos  Listltbyte[]gtinfo.GetValueRelatedMediaAttachedPhotos, typeofListltbyte[]gt              public void GetObjectDataSerializationInfo info, StreamingContext ctxt              info.AddValueRelatedMediaAttachedPhotos, this.nattachedPhotos, typeofListltbyte[]gt          endregion  codepre  pAs you can see Im converting the an image to a byte array. Since there may be more than one image, I create a List of byte arrays. Would this be the most efficienteffective way of storing image data for now Or should I simply just remember a string called filePath for an image and make a list of these. p  pI dont want the user to have so much information in this app that it slows down their other android processes and takes up a lot of storage space on the SD Card. I know having a server would be best and would eliminate this question completely however, what is the next best option that I have. Is storing images as byte arrays better Or is simply remembering a saved image path the best way to do this p  pAny discussion on this topic is appreciated and thanks for your time.p

Negative 1819 pIm building an application using java.swing. Ive got a main panel, a grid panel which displays squares, and a details panel which brings up the details on each square and lets you edit them. The squares are also objects. p  pI have the main panel listening for mouse clicks, and if you click on the grid panel, the grid panel will go through its ArrayList of squares and find which square you clicked on, returning it. This square is passed by the main panel to the display panel, which then sets its local variable currentSquare equal to the square being passed in.p  pWhere Im getting confused is that I can edit currentSquare, and the corresponding square in the ArrayList is being edited I can change the currentSquares public variables or use a setter to change them, but the effect is the same regardless. While this is the effect that Im wanting to have happen, I was under the impression that I would have to have some sort of getterssetters to carry the edited currentSquare back to the ArrayList and replace the old square.p  pMy current theory as to why this is happening is that it has something to do with Javas references, since the square is a custom Object, but Im not certain that this is the case or what caused this. Ultimately I want to know what I did to cause this situation and if its goodok programming practice to leave this as it is or build on this and if I do build on it working like this, how likely is it that it will break. p

If the filenames do not begin  with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so logsfoo.log  with ServerRoot set to Cxamppapache will be interpreted by the  server as Cxamppapachelogsfoo.log.   NOTE Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes  instead of backslashes e.g., capache instead of capache.  If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located  will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply  an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion.    ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.   Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point  ServerRoot at a nonlocal disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive  at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple  httpd daemons, you will need to change at least LockFile and PidFile.  ServerRoot Cxamppapache    Listen Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses andor  ports, instead of the default. See also the ltVirtualHostgt  directive.   Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to   prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.  Listen 0.0.0.080 Listen []80 Listen 80    Dynamic Shared Object DSO Support   To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you  have to place corresponding LoadModule lines at this location so the  directives contained in it are actually available before they are used.  Statically compiled modules those listed by httpd l do not need  to be loaded here.

UserGroup The name or number of the usergroup to run httpd as.  It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for  running httpd, as with most system services.  User daemon Group daemon  ltIfModulegt ltIfModulegt   Main server configuration   The directives in this section set up the values used by the main  server, which responds to any requests that arent handled by a  ltVirtualHostgt definition.  These values also provide defaults for  any ltVirtualHostgt containers you may define later in the file.   All of these directives may appear inside ltVirtualHostgt containers,  in which case these default settings will be overridden for the  virtual host being defined.     ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be  emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such  as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com  ServerAdmin postmasterlocalhost    ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.  This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify  it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.   If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.  ServerName localhost80    DocumentRoot The directory out of which you will serve your  documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but  symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.  DocumentRoot Cxampphtdocs    Each directory to which Apache has access can be configured with respect  to which services and features are allowed andor disabled in that  directory and its subdirectories.    First, we configure the default to be a very restrictive set of   features.    ltDirectory gt     Options FollowSymLinks     AllowOverride All     Order deny,allow     Deny from all ltDirectorygt    Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow  particular features to be enabled  so if somethings not working as  you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it  below.     This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.  ltDirectory Cxampphtdocsgt           Possible values for the Options directive are None, All,      or any combination of        Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews           Note that MultiViews must be named explicitly  Options All      doesnt give it to you.           The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see      httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2modcore.htmloptions      for more information.          Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI            AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.      It can be All, None, or any combination of the keywords        Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit          AllowOverride All            Controls who can get stuff from this server.          Order allow,deny     Allow from all  ltDirectorygt    DirectoryIndex sets the file that Apache will serve if a directory  is requested.  ltIfModule dirmodulegt     DirectoryIndex index.php index.pl index.cgi index.asp index.shtml index.html index.htm                     default.php default.pl default.cgi default.asp default.shtml default.html default.htm                     home.php home.pl home.cgi home.asp home.shtml home.html home.htm ltIfModulegt    The following lines prevent .htaccess and .htpasswd files from being   viewed by Web clients.   ltFilesMatch .htgt     Order allow,deny     Deny from all     Satisfy All ltFilesMatchgt    ErrorLog The location of the error log file.  If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a ltVirtualHostgt  container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be  logged here.  If you do define an error logfile for a ltVirtualHostgt  container, that hosts errors will be logged there and not here.  ErrorLog logserror.log  ScriptLog logscgi.log    LogLevel Control the number of messages logged to the errorlog.  Possible values include debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,  alert, emerg.  LogLevel warn  ltIfModule logconfigmodulegt           The following directives define some format nicknames for use with      a CustomLog directive see below.          LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti combined     LogFormat h l u t r gts b common      ltIfModule logiomodulegt        You need to enable modlogio.c to use I and O       LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti I O combinedio     ltIfModulegt            The location and format of the access logfile Common Logfile Format.      If you do not define any access logfiles within a ltVirtualHostgt      container, they will be logged here.  Contrariwise, if you do      define perltVirtualHostgt access logfiles, transactions will be      logged therein and not in this file.          CustomLog logsaccess.log common            If you prefer a logfile with access, agent, and referer information      Combined Logfile Format you can use the following directive.          CustomLog logsaccess.log combined ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule aliasmodulegt           Redirect Allows you to tell clients about documents that used to       exist in your servers namespace, but do not anymore. The client       will make a new request for the document at its new location.      Example      Redirect permanent foo httplocalhostbar            Alias Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to      access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.      Example      Alias webpath fullfilesystempath           If you include a trailing  on webpath then the server will      require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely      need to provide a ltDirectorygt section to allow access to      the filesystem path.            ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.       ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that      documents in the target directory are treated as applications and      run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the      client.  The same rules about trailing  apply to ScriptAlias      directives as to Alias.          ScriptAlias cgibin Cxamppcgibin  ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule cgidmodulegt           ScriptSock On threaded servers, designate the path to the UNIX      socket used to communicate with the CGI daemon of modcgid.          Scriptsock logscgi.sock ltIfModulegt    Cxamppcgibin should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased  CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.  ltDirectory Cxamppcgibingt     AllowOverride None     Options None     Order allow,deny     Allow from all ltDirectorygt    DefaultType the default MIME type the server will use for a document  if it cannot otherwise determine one, such as from filename extensions.  If your server contains mostly text or HTML documents, textplain is  a good value.  If most of your content is binary, such as applications  or images, you may want to use applicationoctetstream instead to  keep browsers from trying to display binary files as though they are  text.  DefaultType textplain  ltIfModule mimemodulegt           TypesConfig points to the file containing the list of mappings from      filename extension to MIMEtype.          TypesConfig confmime.types            AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration      file specified in TypesConfig for specific file types.          AddType applicationxgzip .tgz           AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers uncompress      information on the fly. Note Not all browsers support this.          AddEncoding xcompress .Z     AddEncoding xgzip .gz .tgz           If the AddEncoding directives above are commentedout, then you      probably should define those extensions to indicate media types          AddType applicationxcompress .Z     AddType applicationxgzip .gz .tgz            AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to handlers      actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server      or added with the Action directive see below           To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories      You will also need to add ExecCGI to the Options directive.          AddHandler cgiscript .cgi .pl .asp       For type maps negotiated resources     AddHandler typemap var            Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.           To parse .shtml files for serverside includes SSI      You will also need to add Includes to the Options directive.          AddType texthtml .shtml     AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule mimemagicmodulegt           The modmimemagic module allows the server to use various hints from the      contents of the file itself to determine its type.  The MIMEMagicFile      directive tells the module where the hint definitions are located.          MIMEMagicFile confmagic ltIfModulegt    Customizable error responses come in three flavors  1 plain text 2 local redirects 3 external redirects   Some examples ErrorDocument 500 The server made a boo boo. ErrorDocument 404 missing.html ErrorDocument 404 cgibinmissinghandler.pl ErrorDocument 402 httplocalhostsubscriptioninfo.html     EnableMMAP and EnableSendfile On systems that support it,   memorymapping or the sendfile syscall is used to deliver  files.  This usually improves server performance, but must  be turned off when serving from networkedmounted   filesystems or if support for these functions is otherwise  broken on your system.  EnableMMAP off EnableSendfile off   Supplemental configuration   The configuration files in the confextra directory can be   included to add extra features or to modify the default configuration of   the server, or you may simply copy their contents here and change as   necessary.

Negative 1819 pI want to update my WCF services, by adding a couple of new methods at the service description. Ive build the new dlls with the new methods, copied them in the bin folder of the WCF website hosted on IIS of the remote server and tried to generate the new proxies with svcutil. p  pSvcutil however doesnt generate the .xsd files. The mex endpoint is set, httpGetEnabled is set to true. Could any change in IIS settings cause this Because thats the only thing that might have changed since I last updated the services successfully, about a month ago.p
Negative 1819 pThere is a very easy trick which creates a dictionarylike structure where keys are types. The structure acts like a codeDictionaryltType, Tgtcode where keys are codeTypecode objects and values are instances of the corresponding types.p  pThis  wonderful structure is as fast as just a variable or array since the lookup is only done once by the compilerJITter and the proper value reference is compiled into your program.p  precode    public static class MyDictltTgt          public static T Value  get set       codepre  pYou can work with that structure like thisp  precodeMyDictltstringgt.Value  MyDictltintgt.Value.ToString codepre  pThe problem is that this dictionary is global.

Negative 1819 pSay I have a container elementdiv on a page. There are other elements outside of it, comprising page layoutnavingation, and there is a fair amount of content inside of it.p  pIn my javascript, I need to findmanipulate a few elements inside of that container. If all of these elements have id properties set, speed wise, is it better to use codedocument.getElementByIdcode considering that once found, the element will need to be turned into a jQuery object for manipulation to find them, or to select them using jQuery like so codeidcode, or to select the container first, store it in a variable, and then select the elements to be manipulated using jQuery like so codecontainer.findidcode p  pWhich approach is faster What does the speed of searches like these depend onp
Negative 1819 pI have an application that can support multiple chat rooms.  I am trying to figure out how to capture which specific room a user disconnected from when they close the browser tab so I can update how many users are joined in a room on the client side.

If I get the disconnect event, I can loop through all the rooms the user belongs to via codeio.sockets.manager.roomClients[socket.id]code, calculate the number of users in the room with codeio.sockets.clientsroom.lengthcode and emit that to each room.  It seems silly to recalculate the number of people in a room if I dont know for sure that this user left that room.p  pIn addition, I notice that in the disconnect event, codeio.sockets.clientsroomcode will show the disconnected user still in the array...I have to set a timeout of 2 seconds before that user is no longer in the array.

Negative 1819 pIm a django novice, coming from the php world.  I couldnt figure how to use django to create certain input fields that I need for a project.  So I manually added the html for those fields, into the template. I.e., I added checkboxes and menus.  In view.py, I then added code to obtain the users selections of the checkboxes and menus, via request.POST.  Using those selections, I can then modify and save the forms instance.p  pAll works well. The only glitch is if the form doesnt validate.  If that happens, I need to redisplay the form, with error messages displayed at the top.  So I call render to redisplay the form.  The redisplayed form, loses all the selections of my customized html.  I.e., the customized checkboxes and menus get reset, but not the django created input fields.  Is there a way to save the users selections for the customized html  Thanks.p

Negative 1819 pI want to make a call recording application where user can record his outgoing call. I have done it. But one little problem, call is recording when I am starting to dial a number.

Negative 1819 pMy application allows the user to create a text message and specify a time and date for when they would like it to be sent. Im having some issues though. Due to the nature of Pending Intents Im not able to create a new one for each message. Thus if a user submits a new text to be sent before the pending intent is executed it overwrites the previous message. So as it stands I cant have more than one message queued up to send.p  pMy solution to this was to maintain an SQLite database with the various message details and simply update the pending intent with whichever message comes next in the database. This also has the added benefit of making implementation of displaying a list of current messages to be sent and editing messages to be sent a lot simpler.p  pThe issue is I dont think Im setting up the database properly. When I run in debug mode it doesnt seem to be entering my database helper class MessagesHelper and instantiating the database variable. Im not sure what Im doing wrong and have been following the android SQLite dev guide.

Plus, I dont know that codeasyncupload.phpcode is a stable WP interface.p  pstrongB. Post the Base64 image to adminajax.phpstrongp  ol liTake the Badge Designer image and JSON and post it to a callback in my plugin through codeadminajax.phpcode.li liIn my plugin decode the data and save the file.li liAdd other image metadata, the same way the Media Uploader would.li liCall codewpinsertattachmentcode, codewpupdateattachmentmetadatacode, etc. Basically, do the relevant parts of codemediahandleuploadcode.li ol  pPros probably the most stable as far as WP and browser versions go. As long as the browser supports the Badge Designer, it will work.p  pCons I have to do a lot of the file checking myself that WP would normally do.

Negative 1819 pI have access to the code for the app I am testing myApp and I have a suite of tests myTest.  When I run my tests, Eclipse compiles and installs both myApp and myTest and all the tests run fine.  So far, so good.  Now I also want to be able to execute these tests against an apk of myApp, and I cannot get this to work due to signing issues.p  pAs I understand it, the solution is to resign myApp.apk with the Android debug keystores signature  so that myTest.apk and myApp.apk will have the same signature.  Renas a hrefhttpsrobotium.googlecode.comfilesAndroidCalculatorAPKTest.pdf relnofollowRobotium tutoriala on the subject recommends a tool to do this, a hrefhttpwww.troido.deresign.jar relnofollowresign.jara.  This tool does seem to work, I can install and run the resulting apk file, but it doesnt wind up with the same signature as myTest.  In other words, when I run myTest debug in eclipse, or from commandline I get the error complaining that the test failed because myApp and myTest dont have the same signature.p  pI can work around this if I use resign.jar to resign both myApp.apk AND myTest.apk.  although this is not a solution, since I cannot debug, only run the tests from the commandline.  Also, its ugly.  I dont understand why this should be  since myTest.apk was created automatically when I ran my test in eclipse, it should already have been signed with the debug keystore, and resign.jar should just reapply the same signature, right  p  pMaybe that tool is outdated or broken.  Well, Renas tutorial also includes steps to resign the jar manually, like sop  precodejarsigner keystore candroiddev.androiddebug.keystore      storepass android keypass android CblahmyApp.apk androiddebugkey zipalign 4 CblahmyApp.apk CblahmyApp2.apk codepre  pThis sems to work, and the afterwards, running jarsigner verify returns jar verified.

Negative 1819 pInstead of the flat structure my code currently has, I want to organize it into modules contained in subfolders and perhaps subsub folders if the modules get big enough. p  pEach module will have one or more translation units which will each produce a .o file. The final target would be to mash up all these object files into a static library for now. p  pI am using plain make and it is already complicated enough.br Is there a system in which the specified model comes naturally or with much less effort compared to writing makefiles by hand   If you are going to recommend cmake, I need some hints as I have already tried and could not come up with a good solution.p
Negative 1819 pIn my app I am using TTS. I have 20 different activities which are changed when the user swipe left or right. According the activity, a text is spoken. I am executing tts with separate thread and activity selection is done with main thread. But the problem is very slow, the UI feels slugish. When I swipe left or right, once tts is finished speaking the text, the activity changes which shouldnt happen because I am using separate thread for tts.

Negative 1819 pI just switched my app over to ARC. The transition was a partial success thanks to the refactoring tool that Xcode provides. The one part that doesnt work is a strange error. p  pI used method swizzling methodexchangeImplementations so that instead of calling UIViews initWithFrame, it will call my myInitWithFrame code. The refactoring process threw an error at the method declaration of myInitWithFrame, so I added the strongemattributeemstrongobjcmethodfamilyinit after the declaration of the method. Now this all works perfectly fine for iOS 6.0 and above, but on iOS 5.0 the lowest iOS I would like to support it doesnt work. Im getting an EXCBADACCESS code1, address0X28. On every run the exact same memory address comes up. p  pI have a UIWebView that calls itsp  precode[[UIWebView alloc] initWithFramewebViewFrame] codepre  pAfter the myInitWithFrame does its initialization, it returns self, then it crashes.

Negative 1819 pI have a simple Sqlite table with 2 columns for a telephone number and a counter. I want to update the table on the basis of .csv files that also contain telephone numbers and counters. If the number exists in the database it should be updated by the sum of the existing counter  the counter in the file. If it doesnt exist a new record should be inserted with the value from the file. My one remaining problem is that the telephone numbers have a zero in the first position. When I populate the db the zero is retained, I can manually select and find an existing number like 09999 when I fetch the values from the file the zero is retained but when I try to insertupdate something happens in my Ruby code that inserts a new record without the leading zero, so 0999 becomes 999 in the db. Numbers without leading zeros are handled correctly.

Negative 1819 pIm working with MSBuild Framework version v4.0.30319  32 bit one on Windows 2008 x64. Wanted to understand how MSBuild manages inline tasks. Will it compile once per call to the task  Or will it compile once and reuse for each call to the task p  pI ran MSBuild with the m argument and tried introducing a deliberate error into the C code. And MSBuild pointed me to 1 text file under a temp folder somewhere in my profile folder. No other text file was generated. However, I didnt know how to figure this if there were no errors.p  pMy intent behind trying to figure this out To know if this will be efficient to the same order as using a compiled dll instead of an inline task. The miniscule overhead of compiling inline task code is acceptable if the compile happens just once because I will save on SCM aspects of the code and the binaries.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltProject xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comdevelopermsbuild2003 DefaultTargetsdefault ToolsVersion4.0gt   ltTarget Namedefaultgt     ltItemGroupgt       ltA Include12345678910gt     ltItemGroupgt     ltMSBuild ProjectsMSBuildProjectFullPath              BuildInParalleltrue              TargetsEchoer              ToolsVersion4.0              StopOnFirstFailuretrue              PropertiesPropA.Identitygt   ltTargetgt   ltTarget NameEchoergt     ltMyTask WhatToEchoPropgt   ltTargetgt   ltUsingTask TaskNameMyTask TaskFactoryCodeTaskFactory AssemblyFileMSBuildToolsPathMicrosoft.Build.Tasks.v4.0.dllgt     ltParameterGroupgt       ltWhatToEcho ParameterTypeSystem.String RequiredTruegt     ltParameterGroupgt     ltTaskgt       ltCode Languagecs TypeFragmentgt         lt[CDATA[         Log.LogMessageProperty received WhatToEcho         ]]gt       ltCodegt     ltTaskgt   ltUsingTaskgt ltProjectgt codepre

Negative 1819 pNote that Ive modified tablefield names etc. for readability. Some of the original names are quite confusing.p  pI have three different tablesp  precodeRetailer IdCode is a unique key  Id  Code  LastReturnDate  ...  DeliveryDeliveryHistory combination of DateRetailerId is unique  Date  RetailerId  HasReturns  ... codepre  pcodeDeliverycode and codeDeliveryHistorycode are almost identical. Data is periodically moved to the history table, and theres no surefire way to know when this last happened. In general, the Deliverytable is quite small  usually less than 100,000 rows  while the history table will typically have millions of rows.p  pMy task is to update the codeLastReturnDatecode field for each retailer based on the current highest date value for which codeHasReturnscode is true in Delivery emorem DeliveryHistory.p  pPreviously this has been solved with a view defined as followsp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeSELECT Id, Code, MAXDate Date    FROM Delivery    WHERE HasReturns  1    GROUP BY Id, Code UNION SELECT Id, Code, MAXDate Date    FROM DeliveryHistory    WHERE HasReturns  1    GROUP BY Id, Code codepre  pAnd the following UPDATE statementp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeUPDATE Retailer SET LastReturnDate       SELECT MAXDate FROM DeliveryView     WHERE Retailer.Id  DeliveryView.Id AND Retailer.Code  DeliveryView.Code WHERE Code  Code AND EXISTS      SELECT  FROM DeliveryView     WHERE Retailer.Id  DeliveryView.Id AND Retailer.Code  DeliveryView.Code     HAVING         MAXDate gt LastReturnDate OR         LastReturnDate IS NULL AND MAXDate IS NOT NULL codepre  pThe EXISTSclause guards against updating fields where the current value is greater than the new one, but this is actually not a significant concern, because its hard to see how that could ever happen during normal program execution. Note also how the codeAND MaxDate IS NOT NULLcode part is in fact superfluous, since its impossible for Date to be null in DeliveryView. But the EXISTSclause appears to actually improve performance slightly.p  pHowever, the performance of the UPDATE has recently been horrendous. In a database where the Retailer table contains only 10002000 relevant entries, the UPDATE has been taking more than five minutes to run. Note that it does this even if I remove the entire EXISTS clause, i.e. with this very simply statementp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeUPDATE Retailer SET LastReturnDate       SELECT MAXDate FROM DeliveryView     WHERE Retailer.Id  DeliveryView.Id AND Retailer.Code  DeliveryView.Code WHERE Code  Code codepre  pIve therefore been looking into a better solution. My first idea was to create a temporary table, but after a while I tried to write it as a MERGE statementp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeMERGE INTO Retailer USING SELECT Id, Code, MAXDate Date FROM DeliveryView GROUP BY Id, Code     ON Retailer.Id  DeliveryView.Id AND Retailer.Code  DeliveryView.Code WHEN MATCHED THEN     UPDATE SET LastReturnDate  Date WHERE Code  Code codepre  pThis seems to work, and its more than an order of magnitude faster than the UPDATE.p  pstrongI have three questionsstrongp  ol liCan I be certain that this will have the same effect as the UPDATE in all cases disregarding the edge case of LastReturnDate already being larger than MAXDateli liWhy is it so much fasterli liIs there some better solutionli ol  h1Query plansh1  h2MERGE planh2  pCost 25,831, Bytes 1,143,828p  h3Plain languageh3  ol liEvery row in the table SCHEMA.Delivery is read.li liThe rows were sorted in order to be grouped.li liEvery row in the table SCHEMA.DeliveryHistory is read.li liThe rows were sorted in order to be grouped.li liReturn all rows from steps 2, 4  including duplicate rows.li liThe rows from step 5 were sorted to eliminate duplicate rows.li liA view definition was processed, either from a stored view SCHEMA.DeliveryView or as defined by steps 6.li liThe rows were sorted in order to be grouped.li liA view definition was processed, either from a stored view SCHEMA. or as defined by steps 8.li liEvery row in the table SCHEMA.Retailer is read.li liThe result sets from steps 9, 10 were joined hash.li liA view definition was processed, either from a stored view SCHEMA.  or as defined by steps 11.li liRows were merged.li liRows were remotely merged.li ol  h3Technicalh3  precodePlan                                            Cardinality Distribution 14 MERGE STATEMENT REMOTE  ALLROWS Cost 25831  Bytes 1143828                                              3738        13 MERGE SCHEMA.Retailer ORCL                                                    12 VIEW SCHEMA.                                                      11 HASH JOIN               Cost 25831  Bytes 1192422                                  3738                    9 VIEW SCHEMA.

Negative 1819 pI am still fairly new to Rails and fairly sure the way Im attempting to go about this is inefficient or just plain silly, but heres what Im trying to accomplish. I have 2 models, Cases patient case files and Inventories medical transplant materials used in Cases.p  precodeclass Case lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany inventories   acceptsnestedattributesfor inventories, rejectif gt allblank end  class Inventory lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto case end codepre  pInventories are created through a separate process and the goal is to associate them with a Case through the Case form. What I am trying to do is put a table on my Case form that lists the available Inventories along with checkboxes to select the desired Inventories to associate with the Case being created. This is further complicated by the fact that I need to be able to include nested fields for a couple of attributes on each Inventory caseprice and caseshipprice. I had previously done this in a very roundabout way using a hasmany through association and storing those attributes on the pivot table, but it involved some hacky code to capture the field inputs from params and then save them through this blockp  precodeclass CasesController lt ApplicationController   def create     case  Case.newparams[case]     if case.save       case.caselineitems.each do li         li.updateattributesprice gt params[lineitemprice][li.inventoryid.tos],                              shippingcost gt params[lineitemshipping][li.inventoryid.tos]       end       redirectto case     else       render new     end   end end codepre  pThis felt extremely clumsy and I was worried about problems it might cause, so I wanted to give a simple hasmany, belongsto relationship a try. However, Im not sure if the typical codelt checkboxtag inventoryids, inventory.id, case.inventories.includeinventory, name case[inventoryids][] gtcode works for that type of relationship. Here is what this section of my form looks like presentlyp  precodelttablegt   lttheadgt     lttrgt       ltthgtltthgt       ltthgtProductltthgt       ltthgtSerial ltthgt       ltthgtPriceltthgt       ltthgtShippingltthgt     lttrgt   lttheadgt   lttbodygt     lt inventories.each do inventory gt       lttrgt         lttdgt           lt checkboxtag inventoryids, inventory.id, case.inventories.includeinventory, name case[inventoryids][] gt         lttdgt         lttdgtlt inventory.product.name gtlttdgt         lttdgtlt inventory.serialnum gtlttdgt         lt f.fieldsfor inventories, inventory do inv gt           lttdgt             lt inv.textfield caseprice gt           lttdgt           lttdgt             lt inv.textfield caseshipprice gt           lttdgt         lt end gt       lttrgt     lt end gt   lttbodygt lttablegt codepre  pThis results in the first checkbox defaulting to checked, and if I leave all unchecked, all of the inventories become associated upon submission. Checking only a subset results in an exception along the lines of codeCouldnt find Inventory with ID206 for Case with IDcode. Finally, checking all of the Inventories seems to result in the associations and nested attributes saving correctly.p  pHow do I clean this up so that it works as desired And if I need to go back to a hasmany through relationship, is there a better way to save attributes on the pivot table on the same form that creates the row on pivot table Id really appreciate any help with this, as no amount of searching has gotten me out of this challenge.p

The async method works as intended, but the sync wrapper method simply hangs, and the result is never produced.p  pSince I am fairly new to the concept of TPL and asyncwait, Im having some trouble explaining the behavior I am seeing here. Is there some sort of limitations in the Async CTP that kicks in, that I am not aware of, or am I doing this in a conceptually wrong wayp
Negative 1819 pSorry if this is obvious, im pretty new.p  pHere is the code.  It should never print the same two things as i understand it, but it sometimes does. The point is that p1 being 1 should prevent p2 from being 1, and if p2 is 1, p2 should run again with the same p1 value, but should generate a new random number. It might be 1 again, but then the function should just keep returning else and running until theyre different, right p  precodeRandom Test with Exclusion P1Item  Empty P2Item  Empty import random import time  def P1     global P1Item     global P2Exclusion     P1Local  random.randint1,3     if P1Local  1         P1Item  Candy         P2P1Local     elif P1Local  2         P1Item  Steak         P2P1Local     elif P1Local  3         P1Item  Vegetables         P2P1Local   def P2A     global P2Item         P2Local  random.randint1,3         if P2Local  1 and A  1             P2Item  Candy         elif P2Local  2 and A  2             P2Item  Steak         elif P2Local  3 and A  3         P3Item  Vegetables         else             B  A             P2B  def Test     printTest     printDefine     P1     printP1Item     P2Item     time.sleep1     input     Test  Test codepre

Negative 1819 pIm seeing what appears to be a bug with the way that map links and apparently ballb custom URLs are handled in iOS7. Id like to know if anyone else is seeing it.p  pSteps to reproducep  ul liGo to Safarili liType maps.apple.comq34.12345,118.12345 in the address barli liSelect All  Copy the text for further testing.li liClick Goli ul  pOne of two things will happen  liA. Youll be immediately taken to the Apple Maps app and the latlon will display with a pin.li or liB. Youll receive a dialog asking if youd like to open the link in Maps, with options of OK or Cancel. Clicking OK will do nothing, and youll be left sitting at a blank Safari window.lip  pThe behavior seems to oscillate between these two conditions A,B,A,B,.... Trying doing the steps again pasting the exact link you saved earlier and let me know if the same thing is happening for you. p  pOddly, the same thing happens if you use the comgooglemapsq34.12345,118.12345 equivalent for Google Maps.  Confirmed it fails as well with the maps custom URL.  Ive also seen this type of behavior when launching the links from the Messages app.p  pI dont know if it will work this way in native iOS apps, but this is what Im seeing when I try to send users an SMS which includes a map link. I ran the scenario on 2 iOS7 phones and the same thing happens on each of them. However, and biOS6 iPad performs as expectedb, launching the Maps app every time.p  pNOTE I tried submitting it as a bug to Apple, but Im run in circles between a broken website that refers me to an email address, and an autoreply that refers me to a broken website.p

The point is to have a nice readable copy of whatever they type in the screen.  An html email is the way the customer wants to go.

Negative 1819 pId like to create a file descriptor that when written to can be read from multiple processes without consuming the data.  Im aware of named pipes, but since its a fifo, only one processes can ever get the data.p  pMy use case is the following.  With git, hooks use stdin to pass data to be processed into the hook.  I want to be able to call multiple subhooks from a parent hook.  Each subhook should get the same stdin data as the parent receives.  If Im not mistaken when I use a pipe, then each subprocess will not get the same stdin.  Instead, the first hook to read stdin would consume the data.  Is this correctp  pThe only option I really see being viable at this point is writing stdin to a file then reading that file from each subprocess.  Is there another wayp

Negative 1819 pHello I am struggling with creating my menu for my linked list. I am told to use fscanf to take in input, but I have an argument that the user may not always enter, specifically a number to add to the linked list. The way I have fscanf set up is it reads a char, a number, and then another char the [enter] key. E.g. the user enters a 20[enter] to add the number 20 to the linked list. However, if the user enters d[enter], then the num field is invalid because the user entered a char Note I strongcannotstrong use fgets. p  pDo I need another fscanf field Heres my menu code belowp  precodeint mainvoid      struct node head  NULL     int num, ret     char select  n     char c     while select  e          printfEnternadd x  add a new node with value x to the list at the front of the listn         printfdel  delete the first node of listn         printflength  print the number of nodes in the listn         printfprint  print the complete listn         printfzero  delete the entire listn         printfexit  quit the programn                   ret  fscanfstdin, c dc, ampselect, ampnum, ampc         if ret  3 ampamp select  a ampamp c  n             Addamphead, num         else if ret  2 ampamp select  d             Deleteamphead         else if ret  2 ampamp select  l             Lengthhead         else if ret  2 ampamp select  p             PrintListhead         else if ret  2 ampamp select  z              ZeroListamphead         else             printfinvalidn          return EXITSUCCESS  codepre
Negative 1819 pIm learning Java at school and I have encountered a problem with inheritance and constructors. I have 3 classes, Class A, Class B and Class C.

I need to use a given Display method to display the parameters of Class1 in a jTextArea in MainJFrame.

Negative 1819 pThis has driven me crazy a few times in the past but Ive always fudged it and moved on. Today I want to try and fix itp  pI quite frequently create a codeGridViewcode to display data and a codeFormViewcode directly beneath in Insert mode with controls in the InsertItemTemplate corresponding to the columns in the codeGridViewcode, so that it looks like the codeFormViewcode is just an empty row of the codeGridViewcode awaiting new data entry.  This works great.p  pThe problem is that I can never get the widths of the columns really just textboxes in the codeFormViewcode to correspond to the widths of the columns in the codeGridViewcode above.p  pIn the example below, as you can see, both the codeGridViewcode and codeFormViewcode have a width of 100 and, sure enough, when the page is rendered theyre both exactly the same width I gave the codeFormViewcode a border briefly to check.  However, even though the widths of the textboxes in the codeFormViewcode are identical to the widths of the columns in the codeGridViewcode, they dont display that way.  The textboxes are slightly wider, and by the time you get to the rightmost column the cumulative effect means that the alignment is way out.p  pIm guessing the problem is something to do with border widths or some other hidden element which is being rendered, but I cant figure it out.  I have to say, the amount by which the alignment is out seems more than the couple of pixels a border would affect things.p  precodeltaspGridView IDgvTPR runatserver DataSourceIDSQLTPR AutoGenerateColumnsfalse DataMemberDefaultView DataKeyNamesTPRID Width100 gt ltRowStyle HorizontalAlignCenter gt ltEditRowStyle BackColorccffff gt ltHeaderStyle BackColor013b82 ForeColorWhite gt ltColumnsgt ltaspBoundField DataFieldTPREnteredAt HeaderTextEntered At ReadOnlyTrue SortExpressionTPREnteredAt ItemStyleWidth24 ControlStyleWidth90 gt ltaspBoundField DataFieldTPRTemp HeaderTextTemp ReadOnlyTrue SortExpressionTPRTemp ItemStyleWidth12 ControlStyleWidth90gt ltaspBoundField DataFieldTPRPulse HeaderTextPulse ReadOnlyTrue SortExpressionTPRPulse ItemStyleWidth12 ControlStyleWidth90gt ltaspBoundField DataFieldTPRRespiration HeaderTextRespiration ReadOnlyTrue SortExpressionTPRRespiration ItemStyleWidth12 ControlStyleWidth90gt ltaspBoundField DataFieldTPRPCV HeaderTextPCV ItemStyleWidth12 ControlStyleWidth90gt ltaspBoundField DataFieldTPRTP HeaderTextTP ItemStyleWidth12 ControlStyleWidth90 gt ltaspCommandField ButtonTypeButton InsertVisibleFalse ShowEditButtonTrue ItemStyleWidth16 UpdateTextSave ControlStyleWidth60px gt ltColumnsgt ltEmptyDataTemplategt No TPR records exist ltEmptyDataTemplategt ltaspGridViewgt ltaspFormView IDfvTPR runatserver DataSourceIDSQLTPR DefaultModeInsert Width100 gt ltInsertItemTemplategt ltasptextbox IDlblEnteredAt runatserver TextWill be added automatically Width24 gt ltaspTextBox IDtxtTemp runatserver Textlt BindTPRTempgt Width12 gt ltaspTextBox IDtxtPulse runatserver Textlt BindTPRPulsegt Width12 gt ltaspTextBox IDtxtRespiration runatserver Textlt BindTPRRespirationgt Width12 gt ltaspTextBox IDtxtPCV runatserver Textlt BindTPRPCVgt Width12 gt ltaspTextBox IDtxtTP runatserver Textlt BindTPRTPgt Width12 gt                 ltaspButton IDbtnAddTPR runatserver TextSave Width5 gt ltInsertItemTemplategt ltaspFormViewgt codepre  pThis renders like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaTB7R.png altRendered GridView and FormViewp

Negative 1819 pI have a C program on a Raspberry Pi Model B that receives data from a remote sensor via an Xbee and then writes a message back via the Xbee.  When I connect the Xbee via a Sparkfun XBee Explorer USB, it works perfectly every time.  But if I run the exact same code using the RPi serial port, the incoming message is always received, but the output message is written from the serial port to the Xbee a few times after reboot and then never again.  I know theres no output from the serial port to the Xbee because I have a logic probe connected to the GND, TXD and RXD pins and I can see the incomming and outgoing packets.  Also, the RPi program writes debug messages for incoming and outgoing packets and both happen when they should.  Im connecting just the 3.3V, GND, TXD, and RXD pins on the RPi GPIO to the corresponding Xbee pins.  RPi is running the 20130910wheezyraspbian release.

Basically, since now i can get all the name of animals from my datastore and i have made them clickable using an html code in template file. In the datastore, there are entries with the same name of animal more than one times e.g. name duck, content water and nameduck, contentlake. Now, when i am clicking into every name of animalsi have use the DINSTINCT in my gql query to print redundant elementse.g. duck only one time.Since the nameduck has two contents, when i am clicking on the name of the duck i want to see both of the contents. My problem is if i am using getbyidlongid i get the unique id of every element. But this will not print me both of the content of the nameduck because every entry has a unique id.

Negative 1819 pI am trying to optimize an algorithm Sudoku in Java for a class and Id like to know the followingp  p1. Does the size of an int significantly affect the speed at which basic operations are performed I.e dividing an int 8 digits long vs 2 digits longp  p2. Is there any way to use binary Or bitfields Im not sure how bitfields work exactlyp  pFor example I need to store the allowed values of each square so instead of making an NxNxN array is there any way to have just an NxN array for each rowcolumn storing something like 011010001 which would mean 2,3,4,9 can be placed in that position I could do boolean I guess but I was also planning to convert every multidimensional array into a single dimension since I have heard Java treats 2D arrays as arrays of arrays unlike c then mod out each value which would work with integers.p  p3. If the above is possible would it be more efficient to have a multidimensional array storing booleans or more efficient to have a single array length N2 or N3 with integers. If it makes a difference N will be between 9 and 25. I am not so much worried about the 9 but I feel 253 can set me back quite a bit.p  pI dont know if I should expect a definitive answer but any insight or estimation would be great. p

Negative 1819 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pRecently my colleague add some new tests to our test project. One of them has not passed on or continuous integration system. Since we have around 800 tests and it takes an hour to run all of it, we often make a mistake and run on our dev machines only the tests which weve currently implemented. This method has its weakness because from time to time tests are passing locally but then fail on the integration system. Of course, someone could say it is not a mistake, tests should be independent of each other. p  pIn ideal world.. sure, but not in my world. Not in a world in which you have a lot of singletons initialized in codeinitializationcode section, lot of global variables introduced by the Delphi itself, an OTL thread pool initialized in background, DevExpress methods hooked to your controls for painting purposes.. and dozens of other things which I am not aware of. So in final result one test can change the behavior of other test. Which of course is bad itself and I am glad it happen, because hopefully I will be able to fix another dependency.p  pIve started the whole test package on my machine and Ive achieved the same results as on integration system. So far so good, now Ive started turning off tests until Ive narrowed down the one test which interfered with the one recently added. They have nothing in common. Ive digged deeper, and narrowed the problem to one single line.

Negative 1819 pIm wondering if codeappcfg.pycode in GAE can be smart enough to not upload Python modules that actually should be preinstalled for GAE apps.p  pE.g., in my workflow Im developing a pure Django app in standard Django environment which is not aware about codehttplib2code module. For the project to be selfcontained Im using codevirtualenvcode and codepip installcode missing modules. And since I couldnt make GAEs codeappcfg.pycode happy in codevirtualenvcode sandbox I simply created symlinks to all custom codevirtualenvcode modules in the root folder. So, for example, I ended up with a symlink codehttplib2 gt ..srclibsitepackageshttplib2code.p  pThen to check if codehttpblib2code had actually been uploaded to GAE I used codeappcfg.py downloadappcode command and, bingo, codehttpblib2code was sitting there, eating my quota for no reason.p  pI could think of tweaking syspath etc. but it is interesting to know if there are some cleaner solutions...p

Negative 1819 pThese are the two fields in the package codejava.time.temporalcodep  pa hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavatimetemporalIsoFields.htmlWEEKBASEDYEARIsoFields.WEEKBASEDYEARap  pa hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavatimetemporalWeekFields.htmlweekBasedYearWeekFields.ISO.weekBasedYearap  pISO8601 defines a socalled week date besides the other two kinds of date, namely the usual calendar date consisting of year, month and dayofmonth and the ordinal date consisting of year and dayofyear. strongA weekdate is defined in the format YYYYWwwestrong. w stands for the weekofyear, e for the numerical ISOdayofweek. Y stands for the weekbasedyear and is identical to calendar year with the exception at the begin or end of calendar year, because a weekbasedyear is bound to the week cycle which can eventually start in the previous year. Two rules are important to understand how a week date is formedp  ol liWeeks always start at Monday.li liThe first week of a calendar year is the week which contains at least four days.li ol  pAt first glance both JSR310fields appear to be identical because ISO8601 only mentions one kind of weekbasedyear. But wait, surprise. Lets consider following code examplep  precodeLocalDate date1     LocalDate.of2000, 2, 29.withIsoFields.WEEKBASEDYEAR, 2014 System.out.printlnIsoFieldsTest   date1  output 20140301  LocalDate date2     LocalDate.of2000, 2, 29.withWeekFields.ISO.weekBasedYear, 2014 System.out.printlnWeekFieldsTest   date2  output 20140225 codepre  pWhile I very well understand the second variation I am really astonished to see the different result for first date which is using the official ISO8601reference in its classname. To explain the calculated resultsp  pThe date 20000229 corresponds to 2000W092 in ISOweekdatenotation while 20140225 corresponds to 2014W092 strongpreserving the weekofyear and the dayofweekstrong. So far so fine. This preserving characteristics for smaller fields is similar to the rule how to change the calendar year which should in most cases keep the month and dayofmonth in a calendar date unchanged.p  pBut what is about the result 20140301 Here the algorithm has simply added four days to the corresponding weekdate in order to take in account the difference in the field dayofmonth 29 versus 25. I have not found any source or official documentation for this behaviour. Does anybody know where we can find the justification for the difference between these two fields Any documentation available about the algorithmic behaviourp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pNow I tried to test the selfconsistency of the new API with this expression in order to find out which of the two fields is better supportedp  precodeSystem.out.println   14 weekbasedyears later      LocalDate.of2000, 2, 29.plus14, IsoFields.WEEKBASEDYEARS codepre  pThe output is 20140301 similar to the described case of codeIsoFields.WEEKBASEDYEARcode, although I still find the result 20140225 2014W092 much more logical. Since this temporal unit is also found in the class codeIsoFieldscode so far the behaviour is selfconsistent within the class codeIsoFieldscode. Looks like an undocumented and nonintuitive feature.p  pI am using the version strongjava.runtime.version1.8.0b132strongp  pstrongMore testingstrongp  precodeLocalDate d  LocalDate.of2014, 3, 1  2014W096 System.out.println   weekofyear in 20140301      d.getIsoFields.WEEKOFWEEKBASEDYEAR System.out.println   dayofweek in 20140301      d.getChronoField.DAYOFWEEK  LocalDate later  d.plus14, IsoFields.WEEKBASEDYEARS  20280302  2028W094 System.out.println   14 weekbasedyears later       later System.out.println   weekofyear in   later        later.getIsoFields.WEEKOFWEEKBASEDYEAR System.out.println   dayofweek in   later        later.getChronoField.DAYOFWEEK codepre  pOutputp  precodeweekofyear in 20140301 9 dayofweek in 20140301 6 14 weekbasedyears later  20280302 weekofyear in 20280302 9 dayofweek in 20280302 4 codepre  pI do not recognize any clear rule. Neither the dayofweek is preserved nor the dayofmonth is preserved while adding 14 weekbasedyears. strongSo this is an extra question What is the rule behind codeIsoFields.WEEKBASEDYEARScodestrong Maybe JSR310team can enlighten usp

Negative 1819 pI have a storyboard that needs to be internationalized and I want to determine if base internationalization would be of any use.p  pI plan to send only strings file to the translators and base internationalization allows text in storyboards to be localized using strings files, as opposed to having storyboard copies for each language. The drawback I see is that the generated string keyvalue pairs look something like thisp  blockquote   pCT6MlBFU.title  Bankp blockquote  pwhere CT6MlBFU is something called the objectID. Now if I were to send these files to the translators there would not be enough context to translate the strings. For example the word bank could mean a financial institution or a river bank, depending on context. In a different language the two words might not be homonyms and different words would be used for the two meanings. Without context information its impossible to translate.p  pThe problem is that the string key value gives no information about where this string occurs, unless you have access to the storyboard and know how to search inside it.p  pIs there any way to define custom string keys or do I ultimately have to set the strings manually from codep
Negative 1819 pIve been working on a server status checker script with PHP, JavaScript, XML, and XLST, and although Ive been getting closer, but am stumped by a new error. I get a xmlParseEntityRef no name error, which is generally caused by stray ampersands in an XML document. However, I have a grand total of zero ampersands in my XML document, so I have no idea what is causing the error. Another thing I found interesting is that if I remove the PHP filefetcher, and just parse the XML file locally, everything works fine. So that leads me to believe that theres something a bit off with my PHP code, but Im not sure what. The filefetcher retrieves and saves the data from the IP address successfully with an XML extension.p  pAny ideasp  pHeres a pastebin link to all the files with the script, since stackoverflow was throwing a fit with me trying to put it all in here a hrefhttppastebin.comNSB31P0f relnofollowhttppastebin.comNSB31P0fap

Negative 1819 pA quick question regarding Angular Forms and Japanese characters. Am using Angular 1.2.17, and modern Chrome web browser on Mac OSX latest. p  pAm writing an AngularJS application for Japanese market. Everything works great displaying Kana etc on the HTML pages etc. There are no issues with the web server, or Database etc, UTF8 support is throughout the application. p  pHowever, for the AngularJS forms, it does not read the Kanji  Hiragana  Katakana unless the word or sentence starts with latin character. Angular scope appears to be unable to distinguish the fact that the JP characters have been typed at all unless prefixed with a latin character.p  pExample p  p does NOT register when typed into the input field, and hence form validation fails because it will think a required field is empty. p  pWhereas p  padsf does register and the form can be submitted successfully. End to end, the JP characters are handled correctly, and get stored into DB correctly. So Angular  JS is parsing the UTF8 text correctly. The issue is likely something to do with how Angular binds to the data scope when only JP characters are provided. It doesnt handle this properly by default.p  pDoes anyone know of any HTML or Angular configuration etc  required Angular module or params, meta tags etc etc, that would coerce the Form to behave properly. Have not tested, but am pretty certain this issue is not specific to JP characters  it is likely anyone working with a non latin alphabet might have experienced the same behaviour.p  pMust be missing something obvious here. p  pThank you for any help at allp

It serves as a fallback solution when  every other rewriteredirect fails e.g. in an aliased environment without  modrewrite. Additionally, this reduces the matching process for the  start page path  because otherwise Apache will apply the rewriting rules  to each configured DirectoryIndex file e.g. index.php, index.html, index.pl. DirectoryIndex app.php  ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt     RewriteEngine On       Determine the RewriteBase automatically and set it as environment variable.      If you are using Apache aliases to do mass virtual hosting or installed the      project in a subdirectory, the base path will be prepended to allow proper      resolution of the app.php file and to redirect to the correct URI. It will      work in environments without path prefix as well, providing a safe, onesize      fits all solution. But as you do not need it in this case, you can comment      the following 2 lines to eliminate the overhead.     RewriteCond REQUESTURI1 ..2     RewriteRule .  [EBASE1]       Redirect to URI without front controller to prevent duplicate content      with and without app.php. Only do this redirect on the initial      rewrite by Apache and not on subsequent cycles. Otherwise we would get an      endless redirect loop request gt rewrite to front controller gt      redirect gt request gt ....      So in case you get a too many redirects error or you always get redirected      to the start page because your Apache does not expose the REDIRECTSTATUS      environment variable, you have 2 choices       disable this feature by commenting the following 2 lines or       use Apache gt 2.3.9 and replace all L flags by END flags and remove the        following RewriteCond best solution     RewriteCond ENVREDIRECTSTATUS      RewriteRule app.php.

The problem comes in the live preview feature I have.  Instead of creating files on the server I am just grabbing the code they wrote from a database so a url to access a users file would be something like a hrefhttpnovuta.compfilescode.phpwatermelon23 relnofollowhttpnovuta.compfilescode.phpwatermelon23a  and it would pull the code from the database where there is an id of 23, pretty simple.  p  pBut... if the user creates a link between two files such asp  precodeltlink rel  stylesheet type  textcss href  httpwww.novuta.compfilescode.phpwatermelon23gt codepre  pthe link will be fine but it would come across to the browser as plane text not a .css file.p  pI am not sure but there may be a way to salve this using .htaccess but the file would have the extension that the user chose.p  pThis is my first question sorry if it wasnt the bestp

Negative 1819 pI am new to Obj C rubyist here so Im not sure how to go about this. So we use AFNetworking in our app which communicates to our server via a JSON API. Looking at the code right now, there is much repetition, and based on my background, I have a penchant for not being repetitive so were aiming to refactor this into just one class. The best would be to include it appwide so we can just access a variable or a method whenever we want to pull something from the server.p  pAnyway, what we have now is something to this effectp  precodeAFHTTPRequestManager manager  [AFHTTPRequestOperationManager manager] manager.responseSerializer  [AFJSONResponseSerializer serializer] manager.requestSerializer  [AFJSONRequestSerializer serializer] [manager.requestSerializer setValuesomeemail.com forHTTPHeaderFieldEMAIL ...

Most of our API calls in different custom controllers are using this pattern. I was thinking, maybe we can pull it out of all the controllers and make it into a class with a method like codegetResponseObjectcode or something because basically thats the only thing we need  a responseObject of the JSON returned by the server.p  pAlso, we are planning to make it available to the whole app, since most of the app are just API calls to the server. Right now we have sortof encapsulated it into a custom class  but I think if I understand it, every time we do an API call, that class will be createdallocated Is it advisable to just create that single instance of a class in AppDelegate so it can be available at any timep  pemEDITemp  pwe are trying to encapsulate these methods a hrefhttpsgithub.comAFNetworkingAFNetworkingblobmasterAFNetworkingAFHTTPRequestOperationManager.mL114L182 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comAFNetworkingAFNetworkingblobmasterAFNetworkingAFHTTPRequestOperationManager.mL114L182a into just one method that takes in the request type as a string GET, PUT, POST etc. p

Negative 1819 pThe custom build activity depends on the following TFS assembliesp  precodeMicrosoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Client.dll Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Workflow.dll Microsoft.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.Client.dll codepre  pThe goal is to compile it in such a way that it will work on TFS 2010, TFS 2012 and TFS 2013 without having to manually specify binding redirections for all the possible Build Agent machines where the activity might be invoked.p  pSupplying a configuration file along with the activity and creating an application domain that uses the binding redirections specified in that configuration file seems like an option, but this ultimately would not work, since the Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Client.BuildActivity attribute that the activity must be decorated with would be read by the calling code before the code in the custom activitys assembly is executed  and if the version of the TFS assembly that that attribute came from does not match the version of the TFS assembly loaded in memory, the activity is as good as if it werent decorated with that attribute at all.p  p I have confirmed that if a custom activity is not decorated with the BuildActivity attribute, the custom activitys type cannot be created and the build fails.p  pRemoving all references to TFS activities and loading TFSrelated types using reflection also seems like another option, but would fail for the same reason, since obviously the BuildActivity attribute cannot be reflectively applied to the class before the code inside the class itself is called by external code.p  pSince the few TFS types and methods the activity depends on exist in the TFS 2010, TFS 2012 and TFS 2013 assemblies and since the activity is compiled against .NET 4.0, the only reasonable workaround I can think of is to create 3 separate builds one compiled against the TFSVS 2010 10.0.0.0 assemblies, one compiled against the TFSVS 2012 11.0.0.0 assemblies, and one compiled against the TFSVS 2013 12.0.0.0 assemblies.p  pAnd of course, while I have the TFS2010TFS2012TFS2013 versions of the above assemblies on my development machine, the assumption is that the Build Agents will have only the version of those assemblies that comes with its version of TFS.p  pThe other workaround seems to be to specify binding redirections for all the Build Agent machines, but with a rather large number of Build Agent machines this is not feasible.p  pIs there an actual solution to this problem or am I stuck having to create 3 buildsp

Negative 1819 pIm a big fan of the Javafx 2 builder notation, however it has been deprecated in Java 8 and I need to replace my old code in a large codebase.  Id like to keep a similar programming style.  Now I could use double brace initialization, but I dont like creating so many anonymous inner classes and I found it can sometimes cause issues with certain classes.  I figured there has to be a way to use lambda to accomplish something similar and came up with this.p  precodepublic class FXUtil    public static ltTgt T buildT node, ConsumerltTgt initializer      initializer.acceptnode     return node     codepre  pSo now I can replace my builders like sop  precodeLabel label  FXUtil.buildnew Label, label gt    label.setTextText   label.setStylefxfontsize 20   label.setMinWidth100  codepre  pThis is not quite as nice as the builder or the double brace syntax, but better than nothing.  My question is does this have any drawbacks similar to double brace initialization  The object itself is not an anonymous class, but am I essentially doing the same thing by creating an anonymous class for the lambda  The lambdas should be garbage collected, correct  Do I even need to worry about this now that permgen space is gone in JDK8  Does anyone else have better way of initializing javafx classes besides using FXMLp  pEdit updated example with suggestion from BenjaminGalep

Negative 1819 pIam facing an issue with an app currently in development. The problem is that the App crash at launch time when it was in background for a while, and only in that case. Launching the app while it was killed doesnt lead to crash, from debugger or from phone. Launching the app while it was in background for about 510 min doesnt lead to crash, while debugging or not. Launching the app while in backgorund for about 1520 min lead to a crash. Using debugger and breakpoint on exception gave me this file p  precodelibdispatch.dylibdispatchassertqueuefail 0x349c6ce4  push   r4, r5, r7, lr 0x349c6ce6  add    r7, sp, 0x8 0x349c6ce8  sub    sp, 0xc 0x349c6cea  movw   r5, 0x7810 0x349c6cee  mov    r4, r0 0x349c6cf0  movt   r5, 0x1 0x349c6cf4  movw   r12, 0x7af0 0x349c6cf8  movt   r12, 0x1 0x349c6cfc  movw   r9, 0x7a83 0x349c6d00  movt   r9, 0x1 0x349c6d04  ldr    r0, [r4, 0x48] 0x349c6d06  movw   r2, 0x7a93 0x349c6d0a  movt   r2, 0x1 0x349c6d0e  movw   r3, 0x7af5 0x349c6d12  movt   r3, 0x1 0x349c6d16  add    r5, pc 0x349c6d18  cmp    r0, 0x0 0x349c6d1a  it     ne 0x349c6d1c  movne  r5, r0 0x349c6d1e  add    r12, pc 0x349c6d20  add    r9, pc 0x349c6d22  add    r3, pc 0x349c6d24  cmp    r1, 0x0 0x349c6d26  add    r2, pc 0x349c6d28  strd   r4, r5, [sp] 0x349c6d2c  it     ne 0x349c6d2e  movne  r3, r12 0x349c6d30  add    r0, sp, 0x8 0x349c6d32  mov    r1, r9 0x349c6d34  blx    0x349dda4c                 symbol stub for [OSobject retainWeakReference] 0x349c6d38  movw   r0, 0x7ae0 0x349c6d3c  movt   r0, 0x1 0x349c6d40  ldr    r1, [sp, 0x8] 0x349c6d42  add    r0, pc 0x349c6d44  bl     0x349c65cc                 dispatchlog 0x349c6d48  trap    0x349c6d4a  nop     codepre  pThe debugger break on the trap line, just before the nop at the end with p  precodeThread 1 EXCBREAKPOINT codeEXCARMBREAKPOINT, subcode0xdefe codepre  pI cant find any clue on how to debug this.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pEDIT  here is a crash log with the stacktrace I replaced my device name with DeviceName and the app name and my company name with com.company.myAppName p  precodeSep 22 113631 DeviceName locationd[63] ltNoticegt Gesture EnabledForTopCLient 0, EnabledInDaemonSettings 0 Sep 22 113631 DeviceName myAppName[6750] ltWarninggt  Assertion failure in [UIFetchContentInBackgroundAction sendResponse], SourceCacheBaseBoardBaseBoard97BaseBoardBSAction.m221 Sep 22 113632 DeviceName myAppName[6750] ltNoticegt BUG in client of libdispatch Assertion failed Block was run on an unexpected queue     Expected queue 0x0x3713cd40[com.apple.mainthread] Sep 22 113632 DeviceName ReportCrash[6766] ltErrorgt tasksetexceptionportsB07, 400, D03, 0, 0 failed with error 4 oskern invalid argument Sep 22 113632 DeviceName ReportCrash[6766] ltNoticegt ReportCrash acting against PID 6750 Sep 22 113632 DeviceName diagnosticd[5999] ltErrorgt error evaluating process info  pid 6750, punique 6750 Sep 22 113632 DeviceName ReportCrash[6766] ltNoticegt Formulating crash report for process myAppName[6750] Sep 22 113632 DeviceName SpringBoard[2836] ltWarninggt BSXPCMessage received error for message Connection invalid Sep 22 113632 DeviceName wifid[68] ltNoticegt WiFi[433071392.290519] BG Application Not Present, BG Daemon Present.

Negative 1819 pI am writing an application where I need to display car inventory. I ping an API to get all cars matching search criteria such as Car Make, Model and Year.

Negative 1819 pI am developing a embree based raytracer currently very early in development. If you are not familiar with embree you can read more at their webpage.p  pThe issue Currently if you start the renderer to use 1 ray per pixel and per iterationreferred to 1 ray mode from now on, it renderers just fine. If you set it trace 4 rays in a packetraypacket4 it renders the mesh fine, util you move some distace away from it, then some black lines appear.p  pa hrefhttpimgur.comaQ12IZ relnofollowIssue Screenshotsa Screenshot camera parameters are  all in ray packet modep  blockquote   ol   liposition 0, 1, 0, rotation 20, 0, 0li   liposition 0, 38, 0 rotation 90, 0, 0li   liposition 9.5, 5, 0 rotation 90, 0, 0li   liposition 9.5, 38, 0 rotation 90, 0, 0li   ol blockquote  pInvestigation showed that the lines appear only in pakcet mode and when some distance away from mesh. I am posting screens of the issue rendered images in several different camera positions.

Switching between the modes is done in main.cpp by just replacing RenderToBuffer4 wtih RenderToBuffer and RTCINTERSECT4 to RTCINTERSECT1.p  pAny help or ideas are much appreciated. p  pEditp  pI apologize for the lack of config files, or scene files, it is currently in very early dev stage 2 days spent and everything is hardcoded for testing at the moment.p  pEdit 2p  pI have discovered that removid the  i in the ray direction calculation in GetRayPacket4, removes the issue, but then the 4 packed rays are identical.

Also the list of the parameters can grow over time i.e. someone can add another dimension at any time.p  pMy best ideas is to use multidimensional array and traverse the parameters one by onep  precodemap[COUNTRY][GENDER][AGERANGE]  VALUE if issetmap[country][gender][agerange]      return map[country][gender][agerange]  else       traverse over each level of the map array, testing each of them as input parameter gt DEFAULT parameter value      In the worst scenario I will end with map[DEFAULT][DEFAULT][DEFAULT] value.  codepre  pBut I dont like this algorithm  as it seems to be too ineffective  Also, therell be certain problems  when new parameter will be introduced Where should a new dimension be inserted How should we rebuild the array.p  pDo anyone have a better ideas how to implement such a systemp

Negative 1819 pI am trying to debug my injected code assignmentcode injected into explorer. I am able to connect to my VMremotely with a remote debugging monitors and attach to my breaking thread int 3 inside explorer, but I can only see my code as disassembly code.

However, codePetControllercode already has codepublic ActionResult CreatePetViewModel vmcode defined, but I cant use that from inside the codePersonControllercode for just writing a new codePetcode to the database. So, I would like to move the db logic of codeCreatePetViewModel vmcode somewhere else, where I can access it from inside other controllers. Where would I move it And is it appropriate to pass a reference to my codeDbContextcode from a controller to a static helper method codepublic static bool CreateHelperDbContext db, PetViewModel vmcodep

Negative 1819 pI have a question about UIKit Dynamics. Lets say Im designing some interactivity, and when the user taps, I want a label with some text to fall off the screen at which point, Ill destroy it, and a new label will spawn and fall from the top, snap to center, and when the user taps, that too falls off the screen, and on it goes.p  precodeimport UIKit  class ViewController UIViewController   var myLabel UILabel var gravity UIGravityBehavior var animator UIDynamicAnimator  override func viewDidLoad      super.viewDidLoad      myLabel  UILabelframe CGRectx 100, y 100, width 100, height 100     myLabel.backgroundColor  UIColor.blueColor     myLabel.text  Some sample text.     view.addSubviewmyLabel      animator  UIDynamicAnimatorreferenceView view     gravity  UIGravityBehavioritems [myLabel]     animator.addBehaviorgravity   codepre  pThe code above will spawn a UILabel and make it drop off the screen. I understand how to do all of that. However, Im at a loss concerning how to determine whether or when the label has fallen completely from view, at which point it is removedFromSuperView, and my new label can spawn and fall from the top.p  pShould I be using a method to determine if the label is intersecting with the view like CGRectIntersectsRect  Or should I try and check whether the center point of the label is inside the bounds of the screen Ive tried hacking together a solution using both of those options but so far nothing has worked.

Negative 1819 pLast few days I was working on a Outlook 2013 function which reads an email and saves all data of the email. This is being done in the VBA code of Outlook and all works fine. The stored VBA data is then transferred to a XML file on the server which also works. p  pWhat I want to do next is read the transferred XML Data in the ASP file which is also located on the server and INSERT the data into an MS SQL server and then removing the XML file.  This all works fine as well since I tested it by manually calling the asp file on the web. p  pThough the thing I cant seem to find out is how to activatelaunch the ASP file from within the VBA code automatically instead of calling it myself manually.  So when the Macro is being clicked in Outlook it gets the data, puts it in an XML file and then it should launch the ASP file. p  pThere is an other way to do it, namely by using a Task Scheduler on my server which launches the ASP file every X minutes and looks for the XML file. This possibility is something I rather avoid though because if a outlook user presses the Outlook macro multiple times in a short time the XML files will overwrite each otter and thus having the change of not getting ALL the right data. p  pI didnt add my code since I think it is not really needed here since the code I have is working, though if code is needed just ask  p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I found a piece of code which opens the asp file on the web and thus launching it. The problem how ever is that it opens the webpage, while it only should run it. So I should add something that the page is also closed right away so the user doesnt see it getting opened, now clue if this can be achieved though.. p  pstrongThe code for opening it is as followsstrong p  precodePrivate Declare Function ShellExecute    Lib shell32.dll Alias ShellExecuteA     ByVal hWnd As Long,    ByVal Operation As String,    ByVal Filename As String,    Optional ByVal Parameters As String,    Optional ByVal Directory As String,    Optional ByVal WindowStyle As Long  vbMinimizedFocus     As Long  Public Sub OpenUrl      Dim lSuccess As Long     lSuccess  ShellExecute0, Open, httpmywebsite.nlMyCode.asp End Sub codepre

Negative 1819 pIn a single .exe application codeWinMaincode entry point has an codeHINSTANCEcode parameter which should be a pseudohandle because equivalent to codeGetModuleHandleNULLcode which returns a pseudohandle, according to MSDN. I suppose its empseudoem because there are both emspecial valuesem such as codeNULLcode to mean entrypoint module and constants used to return an error anything less than 32.p  pMSDN explicitly describes it as a empointerem nowadays equivalent to an codeHMODULEcode to module base address we know this may have a completely different meaning for 16 bit applications but in 3264 bits world each process has its own address space then its emexactem value is useless, probably always the same for each instance and absolutely meaningless outside its process.p  pAll these said, this is my strongfirst questionstrong can we formally, despite MSDN seems to be contradictory assume codeHINSTANCEcode is a pointer even if honestly I dont see any use for this or its better assume its a pseudo handle where its value is emopaqueemp  pLets assume its value is opaque, my strongsecond questionstrong is its value valid perprocess or perthreadp  pWe may think a process handle is valid perprocess but few corner cases make me think we should assume its valid perthread. If these corner cases exist then even if usually it seems to work emas expectedem perprocess were relying on an implementation detail, an emundefined behaviorem subject to change for different architectures, versions, environments.p  pLets see a case where I see an issue code is so trivial that I just describe scenario DLLs has usually a shared code section but they may also have even if its pretty uncommon a shared data section for example to share emexpansiveem data across processes or to implement a quickanddirty IPC mechanism. It may be uncommon but possible and pretty easy to implement, for example in VC, with few codepragmacodes codedatasegcode and codecommentlinkercode directives. In this case were aware inside our DLL that we cant compare codeHINSTANCEcodes because they may have same value but also IMO we cant emtrustem codeHINSTANCEcode we had from thread A within our DLL is emcomparableem to codeHINSTANCEcode we have in thread B. In short each time we need an codeHINSTANCEcode we have to call codeGetModuleHandleNULLcode to get emactualem perthread valid one.p  pAs strongbonusstrong I would also understand how this applies to codeHINSTANCEcode we get as parameter when it comes from codeWinMaincode. In theory its perthread but, for example, codeCreateWindowcode will resolve it correctly because scope is emcurrent executing processem, of course assuming calling thread has its own message loopp  precodevoid createToolboxconst char windowName, HINSTANCE hInstance       ...

[...] A pseudo handle is a special constant that is interpreted as the current thread handle. The calling thread can use this handle to specify itself when a thread handle is required.p blockquote  pObviously this isnt true for desktop applications among other differences.p

The keywords present in this search is Love which should be searched for. So, there must be a process to detect the stop words and eliminate them from the document list we feed to the API. Does google do it automatically in their search API or do we have to process the search query before firing the query If google already uses the IDF Inverse Document Frequency table to eliminate or less  prioritise the stop words, how do they do it If not, how can we eliminate those stop words Does the algorithm if any works for other vernacular languages toop  pLink to Google search API a hrefhttpscloud.google.comappenginedocsjavasearch relnofollowhereap

I assume an open connection really doesnt consume that much memory. p  pIs it more correct to have the ApplicationBeginRequest and close the connection or not Since this should all happen automatically anyway... are there any benefits or negatives to doing thisp  pWould prefer a long technically explanation with supporting info, rather than Yes as an answer.p
