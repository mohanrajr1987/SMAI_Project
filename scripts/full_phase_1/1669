Thats so i will be able to run them all in transactions.p  pEvery second I get a new set of files that has to be entered into a SQL Server 2005 Express.p  pThe Application can run for 24 to 36 hours and than suddenly get a EAccessViolation in a query.p  pThis query is by then been executed for atleast 24  60  60 times.p  pIm not shure if it also happens with querys without parameres because most of the queries 90 has parameres. they are insertsupdates or select with a parameters.p  pwhen this occures all queries afterwards get the same EAccessViolation and after a while I get a StackOverflow. p  pWhile the code is constructed in sutch a manner that an exception will be handled and the next time the code should run without problems.p  pthe fact that this is happening in varios queries that didt change from the former version with the only change that in stead of using dbGo from BCB Builder 2007 we did ADO with Cpp Builder 6.0.p  pI asume that it is someware in the Windows version MDAC2.8 or in de dbGo from CodeGear. The fact that in the previous version ADO BCB6.0we didt run into it and now with dbGO and BCB2007 we have is it making that part very suspicius.p  pI hope that some has some nice Ideas what could be the reason for all this.p  pAt the moment I Cant reproduce it here on a desktop. Im still trying to get it reproduced that will defibnitly give more info.p  pIm open for suggestions.p  pregardsp  pjvdn.p

Negative 1669 pI think I get the OOP paradigm at its basic level but Im having a hard time conceptualizing the proper way to lookup records in a database. I suspect this is because I dont really get OOP as much as I think I do...p  pThe application Im trying to write is a shopping cart because it has a lot of good candidates for objects. The object Ill be working with is a product yes, this is very primitive.p  precodeltphp class Product  public id  0 public name   public price  0  function constructid   if id exists try to retrieve  a product with id  else create a new product  and set thisgtid    product  new Product echo productgtname gt codepre  pEasy enough. But now I want to look up multiple products for a search results page and Im not sure how to handle it.p  pMy inclination is to write another class that takes some input and performs a SQL query that  just returns a list of product ids. I would then loop through those results and create a product object for each one. I could then loop through the array of objects and build my search results page.p  pIm not sure why but this just doesnt feel like the right way. Seems like too much work because first Im doing a query to just get a list of product ids and then I do more queries to get each products data. Itd be a lot faster if just did one query that returned all the data I need.p  pWhats the right thing to do Something else perhapsp

The textblocks seem to be slightly larger than the listbox, causing the horizontal scrollbar to appear.  This is strange because their widths are bound to the lisboxs ActualWidth.  Also, if you add a few more items to the listbox just cut and paste in XamlPad causing the vertical scrollbar to appear, the width of the textblocks do not resize to the vertical scrollbar.p  pHow do I keep the codeTextBlockcodes inside the codeListBoxcode, with or without the vertical scrollbarp
Negative 1669 pAfter some resent tests I have found my implementation cannot handle very much recursion. Although after I ran a few tests in Firefox I found that this may be more common than I originally thought. I believe the basic problem is that my implementation requires 3 calls to make a function call. The first call is made to a method named codeCallcode that makes sure the call is being made to a callable object and gets the value of any arguments that are references. The second call is made to a method named codeCallcode which is defined in the codeICallablecode interface. This method creates the new execution context and builds the lambda expression if it has not been created. The final call is made to the lambda that the function object encapsulates. Clearly making a function call is quite heavy but I am sure that with a little bit of tweaking I can make recursion a viable tool when using this implementation.p  precodepublic static object CallExecutionContext context, object value, object[] args      var func  Reference.GetValuevalue as ICallable     if func  null              throw new TypeException          if args  null ampamp args.Length gt 0              for int i  0 i lt args.Length i                      args[i]  Reference.GetValueargs[i]                   var reference  value as Reference     if reference  null              if reference.IsProperty                      return func.Callreference.Value, args                  else                      return func.CallEnviromentRecordreference.Value.ImplicitThisValue, args                   return func.CallUndefined.Value, args   public object Callobject thisObject, object[] arguments      var lexicalEnviroment  Scope.NewDeclarativeEnviroment     var variableEnviroment  Scope.NewDeclarativeEnviroment     var thisBinding  thisObject  Engine.GlobalEnviroment.GlobalObject     var newContext  new ExecutionContextEngine, lexicalEnviroment, variableEnviroment, thisBinding     Engine.EnterContextnewContext     var result  Function.ValuenewContext, arguments     Engine.LeaveContext     return result  codepre

Negative 1669 pSo I am porting a game I started in html canvas to flash as3. p  pIn this game there is a tank. This tank has a body and a turret. It can rotate 360 degrees and move foward and backwards and swivel its turret 360 degrees. The tank base and the turret are seperate animated images.p  pI have set it up so that there is a tank movieclip and a turret movieclip. And I have added code to the tank movieclip so that it creates a turret for itself in the constructor part like this. p  precode turret new turretMovieClip     addChildturret codepre  pSo the tank movieclip class now has this turret variable that holds an instance of the turret movieclip. Also in the constructor of the tank movieclip, there is code to give itself a shadow. p  precodevar dropShadowDropShadowFilter  new DropShadowFilter dropShadow.distance  5 dropShadow.angle  45 dropShadow.color  0x000000 etc.... this.filters  new ArraydropShadow codepre  pBut this is the weird part. I expected the code above to only put a shadow around the tank because this is code for the tank movieclip. But it put a shadow around the tank and the turret. When I added the turret, the tank movieclip changed or something I did not want this to happen. I want the tank to have its own shadow and the turret to have its own shadow.p  pHere is an image I made illustrating the problem a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comEJuf3.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comEJuf3.jpgap  pFig 1 is from my old game. The shadow correctly casts itself over the tank and the ground. Fig 2 shows what the above code did. It gave a shadow for the tank and turret, but it only casts over the ground. Anyone know what I am doing wrong I think I could fix this by making a master tank class that then creates a tank movieclip and then a turret movieclip. Is that how Im supposed to do thisp

Negative 1669 pI have a codeUINavigationControllercode and I would like the view of every view controller that is popped onto the stack to have a common paddingmargin e.g. 25 pixels on all sides. What is the best way to accomplish thisp  pI originally thought that I could implement codeUINavigationControllerDelegatecode and inside the codenavigationControllerdidShowViewControlleranimatedcode or codenavigationControllerwillShowViewControlleranimatedcode methods, simply change the frame of the view controller that was about to be displayed. This does not seem to have an effect though. p  pI tried to do the same thing inside the view controllers codeviewDidAppearcode and codeviewWillAppearcode methods, but this also did not work. Ideally, I dont want to put any logic in the controllers anyway, as they may not always be used inside a navigation controller.p  pOne last idea that I havent tried yet is to create a wrapper codeUIViewControllercode that would actually get pushed onto this stack. This wrapper would add the real view controllers view as a subview with a frame that would provide the desired margin. The downside here is that I would need to subclass codeUINavigationControllercode and override codepushViewControlleranimatedcode, where the wrapper would be initialized and pushed. Apples documentation indicates that codeUINavigationControllercode is not meant to be subclassed.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 1669 pI have an interesting problemquestion and im not sure if it is even doable. So I have a custom header view for regular UITableView. But its transparent and it doesnt fill fill table width. So it displayed properly when table is scrolled and this header view is displayed above cell content sticked to the top. But when same header is displayed between two sections down  it looks ugly, because its transparent and its either displayed above black rectangle or above table background. p  pI was wondering is there way to customize header view for when its stick to the top and when its not. Or... may be its possible to specify what needs to be displayed underneath header view when its between sections. Something like sectionSeparatorViewp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comv3ePH.png altscreenshotp

Negative 1669 pIm creating a simple online multiplayer game, with which two players clients can play the game with each other. The data is sent to and fetched from a server, which manages all data concerning this.p  pThe problem Im facing is how to fetch updates from the server efficiently. The data is fetched using AJAX every 5 seconds, data is fetched from the server to check for updates. This is however done using HTTP, which means all headers are sent each time as well. The data itself is kept to an absolute minimum.p  pI was wondering if anyone would have tips on how to save bandwidth in this serverclient scenario. Would it be possible to fetch using a custom protocol or something like that, to prevent all headers like Server Apache being sent emeachem single time I basically only need the very data only 9 bytes and not all headers which are like 100 bytes if its not more.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1669 pI like to backup up the source code set for a project when I release a version.  I use GExperts project backups, which seems to gather up all the files in the project manager into the ZIP file.  You can also add arbitrary files to this file set, but Im always conscious of the fact that I havent necessarily got all the files.  Unless I specifically go though the uses clauses and add all the units I have sources for to the project, Ill never be sure of storing all the files necessary to recreate the installableexecutable.p  pIve thought about rolling an app to traverse a project, following all the units used and looking down all the search paths and seeing if there is a source file available for that unit, and building a list of files to back up that way, but hey  maybe someone has already done the workp

Negative 1669 pGiven a class such as the one below and the given union, how does one initialize the union to the correct value  p  pWhat is being attempted here is to use two or more different types as one of the core data types for the class.  Instead of using void, given that the types are known ahead of time a union of the types that are going to be used is constructed.  The problem is how to initialize the correct union member when the class is instantiated.  The types are not polymorphic, so the usual inheritance model did not seem appropriate.  Some naive attempts to initialize the correct union member led nowhere.p  precodeunion Union     int n    char sz   class Class     public    Class int n  d 1.0 , u n      Class char sz  d 2.0 , u sz      ....    double d    Union u  codepre  pAfter scouring for a solution, an answer became obvious, and could possibly be a good solution for this repository of answers, so I include it below.p

Negative 1669 pI am trying to write a variable monitoring class that allows me to pass it a pointer ideally void addressing a memory location which would normally be completely outofscope or inaccessible for the class. The class would then periodically display on the screen in text the contents of that memory location  interpreted in a user defined way eg. int . I would only ever read from memory using this pointer and it would serve as a dirty hack to enable a kind of watch window during development for the variables that I am temporarily interested in monitoring during runtime  without introducing a lot of code to bring these variables in scope  accessible to the class. p  pI am using VC 2010 and it seems to flat out refuse to let me even write an out of scope memory location address to the pointer.p  pI guess theres a lot going on under the hood in windows such that this approach may have very limited applicability as memory locations change but I am using native C so am hoping that my addresses are persistent enough to be useful. Also, I can see that it would not like me accessing a memory location that my program is not actually using for security reasons...p  pAny ideas how I can do this I realise that using such pointers gives rise to undefined behaviour so would only ever read from them and display the value.p  pThanks.p

I want to use the mocked object during testing and the real thing for production. How do I do thatp  pSecondly, where should I put the code that inspects the file system. Im not really using a database for this since Im building info by looking at the directory. So should there be a model at all Or should I do the heavy lifting in the controllerp  pIm sure Im staring the solution in the face, but any help you can give will help me make my first tentative steps into Rails loveliness.

Negative 1669 pWe have a card game website that makes extensive use of jQuery Draggable amp Droppable and which has worked nearly flawlessly when using a mouse for almost a year.p  pWe would REALLY like to have the site work on touch screen devices, but we cannot seem to get jQuerys drag and especially drop functionality to work reliably.p  pDragging works ok unless the div being dragged is inside another dom element with any kind of offset, margin, padding, etc. If it is, the dragged element is also offset from the users finger by a similar amount. May not sound like a big deal, but it makes the interface unusuable.p  pDropping just doesnt seem to work.p  pWeve researched various options presented here on SO will try to update this post with links to some of them if I can, but none work for us.p  pWeve also researched jQuery Mobile but this is still in alpha and even so seems to be more of a framework for making a site emulate the UI of a phone vs what were looking for.p  pMost of the SO and Google posts on this topic seem to trail off in late 2010 which makes me think there is an obvious answer that maybe were just missing.p  pBTW, the functionality were looking for is clearly technically possible because the YUI libraries for drag and drop work as expected. Unfortunatly, we cant justtify refactoring the site to switch from jQuery to YUI.p  pAnyone out there have any ideas We would settle for a answer that supports only iPad, but it really needs to not require we refactor the existing site.p  pThanksp
Negative 1669 pI am studying data warehousing star schema and attribute hierarchies and I am getting confused because the examples of the book do not provide sample data on which to confirm my understanding of things.p  pIn the book there is a sales data warehouse with a dimension for products that has the following attribute hierarchy PRODUCTAllProducts, ByProductType, OneProductp  pSee the image below img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZkk7b.jpg altenter image description herep  pWhat kind of sample data would go into the product dimension tablep  pPRODUCTSp  hr  pAllProducts  ByProductType  OneProductp  hr  pnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspp  pnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspp  pnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspp  pIf Im not mistaken attributes are table columns or fields and I cant understand how would the data look like in this tablep  pIf you take the dimension Time from the same image, data can easily be sampledp  pTIMEp  hr  pYear Quarter Month Weekp  hr  p2010 1nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp1nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp1p  p2010 1nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp1nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp2p  p2010 1nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp1nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp3p  p2010 1nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp1nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp4p  pOne other thing I am confused about is how the data looks like in the fact table.

Negative 1669 pI am writing an API for my ASP.NET application that other developers will use. The API will basically return a list of people with their first name, last name, and id. There are lots of ways to write web services in ASP.NET, the easiest probably being create a web service function asmx that returns a DataTable.

Negative 1669 pI have a table containing 2 types of text inside a column.

Negative 1669 pI need to add checkboxes to every column header in a codeltrichdataTablegtcode. A selected checkbox means the corresponding column will be included in a pdf report to be generated from the table data. Additional requirements are the columns must be sortable and I must be able to mix codeltrichcolumngtcode and codeltrichcolumnsgtcode tags.p  pIve tried to accomplish this a couple different ways.

Does anyone know of a better way to do something like this or at least how to avoid the sorting when I click the checkbox in the second code examplep  pThank you very much.p
Negative 1669 phi Im trying to incorporate a checkbox into my jquery table.. table data will be populated from a database.. under the table is buttons delete, edit, and add buttons.. I have a script that will check if a checkbox or tick or not.. so that when someone tries to delete a row and he isnt checked any checkbox , an alert will tell him that heshe should choose any row to delete first. the problem about my script is that if the table has only one row..even I tick the checkbox, it will still alert that I should choose a row to delete.

Negative 1669 pIm trying to wrap my mind around the MVC framework of Sencha Touch, but Im finding a couple of different approaches. In one, found a hrefhttpvimeo.com17705448herea, there is an approach to structuring Sencha Touch apps presented at SenchaCon 2010. It has the added weight of being by a Sencha Touch employee, but it is several months old. In other, more recent posts on Sencha Touch MVC, they have tutorials such as a hrefhttpwww.sencha.comlearnTutorial3aASenchaTouchMVCapplicationwithPhoneGapherea, as well as Mannings MEAP emSencha In Actionem by Jay Garcia that seem to rely on Ext.Dispatch in the views to call specific controller methods, passing additional elements to the controller, which makes the views controlleraware.p  pMy question is, which is considered the best practice to structure a Sench Touch MVC appp

Negative 1669 pOne of the barriers that as far as I know was never removed, but perhaps Im mistaken and this was resolved a while ago to being able to have truly cross browser compatible tests  with Watir and Firewatir is that Watir was originally designed to use One based indexing, while whoever created firewatir broke with that and made it Zero based.   p  pWhile Im sure there are good historical reasons for each decision, and I dont want to debate which is right, its been a pain for testers trying to create scripts that run under each without any alteration since at the very least this affects identifying elements by index, which is sometimes something youve no choice but to do.p  pIm wondering if moving to WatirWebdriver could create a more uniform platform p  pAlso do we have any reference to the differences between the latest Watir, and WatirWebdriver   For example in a recent question here it came up that .value  is not implemented as a direct set without events alternative to .set, and basically acts just the same as .set does. p

Negative 1669 pI have just started with Zend Framework, so I have lots of questions about the structure. I hope I can explain it properly, its rather difficult.p  pOk, I have done the Quickstart Tutorial and decided to use a similar structure for my first project.p  pSo I have a Datamapper, a Model and the Database Table File.p  pI have created a Form where I can enter a some InformationItem and upload Images with it.p  pI have 2 Datamapper Item and Image as well as 2 Models for them. I have an Item Controller, that one jumps into the ItemMapper. In the Datamapper I have a save Method. Please see below p  precode public function saveApplicationModelItem item       data  array            itemtitle        gt itemgtgetItemTitle,            itemdescription  gt itemgtgetItemDescription,                  thisgtgetDbTablegtinsertdata       Add Image Information imageData is Session Data      table   new ApplicationModelDbTableImage     foreach imageData as fileData               image  new ApplicationModelImagefileData         data  array                 imagenewname   gt imagegtgetNewImageName,               imagethumbname gt imagegtgetImageThumbName,                            tablegtinsertdata       codepre  pNow the question I have.p  ol liI have Getter and Setter in my Model. Should everything what is in the Item Database Table be in 1 Model Means everything about the Image should go to the Image Model since it is in a different Database Tableli liIs it correct that I save the Information about the Image in the Item Mapper Shoudl I not have a save Method in the ImageMapper and save it in there If so, how do I jump from the Item Mapper to the Image Mapper Or would I first finish everything about the Item, return the ID to the Controller and than call the ImageMapper from the Controllerli lipI read something about Fat Model Thin Controller. I had this all the time in my had, but I noticed that my Controller got pretty fat with just putting the Form together. I have about 5 Dropdown Fields which are depending Dropdowns. When I saw that I duplicating Code I decided to add this in a separate Function. So f.e. I have a Dropdown for counties. I wrote a Function which is also in my Controller so it looks like thisp  precodepublic function getCounties  codepre  p  p  precode List of Counties does not exist in Cache, read from DB     ifCountyList  thisgtgetFromCachecounties      geolocationMapper  new ApplicationModelGeolocationMapper     CountyDropdown  geolocationMappergtcreateCountyDropdown       Save DB Result in Cache     thisgtaddToCache counties,CountyDropdown     return CountyDropdown  else      Return Country List from Cache     return thisgtgetFromCachecounties                 codepre  p  pli ol  pIn my Add Function I usep  p Assign Geo Info to Formp  precodeCountyList  thisgtgetCounties                formgtgetElementcountygtsetMultiOptionsCountyList    codepre  pThe Edit Function thanp  precodeCountyList  thisgtgetCounties formgtgetElementcountygtsetMultiOptionsCountyListgtsetValueactiveCounty codepre  pall the Functions like getCounties  stay in the Controller or should it be moved to the GeolocationMapper And if so, how would that be called upp  ol liShould the Form be created in some Function so I would only call up something like createForm  I really have a lot of duplication Add and Edit Function and than Stuff comes from Database or Form was not Valid and it comes from Cache with a setValue. It just adds up when using dependable Dropdowns. li ol  pI know this are lots of questions, but I have the feeling it gets very messy, as a learner you are happy when it works, but I would also like to structure it in a proper way. I hope it all makes sense.p  pMaybe some of you have a few Tipps I could use. Thanks a lot for your help in advance.p

I can get about one message through per second, maybee a little more. Is this to be expected or is there any way of speeding this up with async operations I dont need it to bee async for any particular reason other then WP7 demands it...p

Negative 1669 pAre there any alternative Fusion Log Viewer programs, other than Fuslogvw.exe, or directing the Fusion log output to your own directory and then examining the tons of HTM files by handp  pMy two main gripes arep  ol lipId like an overview that showed which assembly loads succeeded and which failed. pli lipIm unsure of the resolution of the timestamps on the logging files, so Im unsure of which entry comes before another entry. For example, my program is apparently trying to load an assembly with both cultureda and culturedadk. It should only be trying to load dadk, and in fact that load is successful. So why is it also unsuccessfully trying to load cultureda It might help if I at least was sure of the order in which it is trying to do these loads, but Fuslogvw.exe displays the two entries randomly, and logging to a private directory isnt much better.pli ol

If they forgot their password it cannot be emailed because they no longer have this email.br br  My boss wants me to implement a system to ask a few identifying questions such as firstlast name, dob, and favorite questions which they answer on  their initial login. This seems really bad to me because 1 this is wish it was security and 2 the website holds extremely personal informationbr  br  Does anyone have any ideas or better implementations for this One thing I considered was asking them for a secondary email on their initial registration, but I am wondering what else is out there.

Negative 1669 pIs there any way of reliably allocating reserving hard disk space via standard Java J2SE 5 or laterp  pTake for example the case of a multithreaded application, executing in a thread pool, where every thread downloads files. How can the application make sure that its download wont be interrupted as a result of disk space exhaustionp  pAt least, if it knows beforehand the size of the file it is downloading, can it do some sort of reservation, which would guarantee file download, irrespective of what the other threads are doingp  pThere is a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions245251createfilewithgivensizeinjavasimilar question in StackOverflowa, but it does not discuss multithreading and also uses NIO.p  pstrongEDITstrong After some further testing, the solution proposed on the similar question does not seem to work, as one can set ANY allowed length via the suggested RandomAccessFile approach, irrespective of the underlying hard disk space. For example, on a partition with only a few gigabytes available, I was able to create TB terrabyte files at will.p  pThe solution would have been sufficient if the getFreeSpace method of the File class reported a decreased amount of available space every time one created a new file, but it actually doesnt, thus confirming the zero length which, in practice, these files seem to have.p  pThese are at least the results I am seeing on a CentOS 5.6 virtual machine, running in VMWare Player 4.0.0.p

This calls my servers resources url and fetches an array of json hashes with only a few fields for each resource.p  pLater on, when users navigate to a details page, I want to get more data for a particular record from the server. When I call App.store.find passing the records id, I get back the original fetched record and the adapters find method is not called. p  pHow do I force the store to call the find method in the adapter when a record already exists or whats the best way to first get a list of records with few fields and then get details for a particular record with many fieldsp  ptks.p
Negative 1669 pOkies this question is similar to one I have asked recently on Stack Overflow, but Im basically just using the code from the CakePHP Book rather than my own code to try and understand why something is not working.p  pBasically the idea is to allow a user to login using their email address as well as their username in version 2.0 of Cake. However it always returns that the details are incorrect but I can STILL login with the username, so basically the override in the AppController does not change anything...

Negative 1669 pIm trying to get some sensible positioning of my radiobuttons which are part of a RadioGroup. I was having trouble as my RadioGroup was sitting on top of the rest of my layout design, then I use margins to push the buttons around, the problem here is this works on one or two device layouts only. I thought I struck gold when I discovered I could define my RadioGroup then put in a RelativeLayout below which amongst other things contained one of the RadioButtons, then I repeat twice more. this gives me the layout I desire. Problem is, when I run the code, the RadioButtons act link standalone buttons   p  pSo two questions, p  ul lipcan I link these buttons back to the Grouppli lipIs there a decent way to be able to

Negative 1669 pI was wondering about this a couple of weeks ago when looking at a hrefhttpderbyjs.com relnofollowhttpderbyjs.coma and meteor.js. What I like about these platforms is that these support sharing of HTMLtemplates on both server like ASP.Net MVC Views AND client for browsers that support JavaScript. Basically combining ASP.Net MVC server side rendering of HTML and the ASP.Net Single Page App architecture. So that we only have to maintain view  template code in one place and have it available for serverside rendering as well as client side MVC  MVVM. Is there a solution like this available or in the works somewherep

However, grouping on the HotelID and including date related measures such as Last7DaysGross need to perform very well.p  pWhat kind of structures would work here  I dont think Id be able to use indexed views the way that I had hoped, because of the multiple restrictions on them no subqueries, etc.  To have reasonable performance, will I need to create a new table at the Hotel level aggregated from the HotelStayDate level  Thats the level at which people will most often be querying.

Negative 1669 pI have a custom class that extends the in built WPF Canvas called VisualCanvas and its the main content area for the application grpahics.  I have another custom class extending Canvas called SharedTransformCanvas and it will be used for adornments on top of the main content.  The SharedTransformCanvas does not have a background colour set so mouse event etc are generally handled by the VisualCanvas.  Both canvases have Transform dependency properties and are bound to a view model exposing another objects transform i.e. the canvases are sharing a transform.  Both canvases are within a grid of one row which is within a ScrollViewer.p  pThe user can scroll the mouse wheel in the main canvas in order to zoom. This affects the transform shared between the two as I want the adornments to zoom in the same way as the main content and this generally works i.e. the adornments have a synchronised zoom.p  pThe problem is when the user zooms in then scroll bars should appear and they were not so I overrided MeasureOverride on VisualCanvas in order to take the scale transform into account and report a larger size and make scroll bars appear.  This solves the problem of the scrollbars appearing when the user zooms in but at the point the user zooms in enough for the scroll bars to appear the content of top SharedTransformCanvas seems to suddenly ignore the transform and jump back to its size with no transform applied.  I have also tried to override MeasureOverride in SharedTransromCanvas to take into account the transform in the same way and report a bigger size but this does not fix the problem.p  pIf I remove the scroll viewer the synchronised zoom seems to work fine but once you zoom too far you miss some content off the screen and have no way to scroll.p  pI dont understand how the scroll viewer is interacting with the top canvases perception of its transformation  Can anyone explain this behaviourp

Negative 1669 pAll,p  h11h1  pPlease confirm but I observed today that the default setting for fetching collections at least is Lazy  false which is opposite of NHibernate. i.e. when you dont specify Lazy on your HasMany attr, the collections are fetched immediately.p  h12h1  pAnother question I have specified on my Order Entity referencing the Customer entity BelongsToLazy  FetchWhen.OnInvoke, that setting is not honored, I get my customers eagerly fetched when I get the orders. Whats going on there Why are the customers fetched eagerly for all returned orders After tinkering, when I add lazy on the Customer Entity itself ActiveRecordLazy  true, the Lazy setting on BelongsTo works as expected. Therefore, it looks like the BelongsToLazy  FetchWhen.OnInvoke is ONLY honored when the referenced entity has explicitly enabled lazy loading via ActiveRecordLazy  true.p  h13h1  pIs there a way in the castle active record config file to set global setting for Lazy  true for all entitiesp

Negative 1669 pHi all Iam using Cakephp 2.x, I need to output individual users comments for each individual event. Each user has many events and many comments. I have Events, Comments and Users models and want to allow users to post and view comments on each event view.ctp. If anyone could give any starting tips to implement this functionality it would be much appreciated.p  pI have tried to output the comments model index table in the events view.ctp, but the table is not populated with the comments from the database, but the comments view.ctp does in fact populate the table with the comments. I have used the thisloadModelComments function in the events controller.p  precodeltdiv classevents viewgt     ltphp echo thisgtHtmlgtcssviewevent gt     ltphp echo thisgtelementmaintitlegen gt

Negative 1669 pI am trying my hand at Wordpress plugin development. From all of the getting started examples and tutorials I have seen, it seems as though plugins can do little more than, say, add a Bookmark This at the end of a post, add an icon next to external links, or other relatively minor enhancements to existing features.p  pI would like to develop an extension might that be the better word where a user can go to codemywordpresssite.comtheextensioncode and access the features of the web application. However, since all extensions must placed within codewpincludespluginstheextensioncode, does that mean that is the only way the plugins can be accessedp  pHow could I design the extension and containing pages to be accessed with a URL like this codemywordpresssite.comtheextensioncodep

Negative 1669 pGood evening.p  pSo, I have to store information about different places. Each place has different information including a title, category and location. The problem is that I will have around 50 million places and ill have to search them by title, category and locationwhich consist of street, country etc.. p  pI have installed MySql and mongoDB, but other alternatives are also accepted. Also, the server has only 2GB right nowit will be increased later  more RAM or maybe even a cluster...but later and im not sure if it is enough. The HDD space should be more than enough.p  pSome of my ideas were to create tags for each place, and search by tagstags will be the fields i use for search, and indexed, but im not sure if it is a good idea and how is it better to implement.p  pAre there any suggestions about how is it beter to implement it  I will fill it only once with all information, and then use it only for searches.p  pP.S. in the current test version im using the MySql database from JAVA, with JDBCi though that its faster than JPA solutions.p

Negative 1669 pIve used MongoEngine a lot lately. Apart from the MongoDB integration, I like the idea of defining the structures of entities explicitly. Field definitions make code easier to understand. Also, using those definitions, I can validate objects to catch potential bugs or serializedeserialize them more accurately.p  pThe problem with MongoEngine is that it is designed specifically to work with a storage engine. The same applies for Django and SQLAlchemy models, which also lack list and set types. My question is, then, strongis there an object schemamodel library for Python that does automated object validation and serialization, but not objectrelational mapping or any other fancy stuffstrongp  pLet me give an example.p  precodeclass WheelEntity     radius  FloatField1.0   class BicycleEntity     front  EntityFieldWheel     back  EntityFieldWheel   class OwnerEntity     name  StringField     bicycles  ListFieldEntityFieldBicycle   owner  OwnernameEser Aygn, bicycles[]  bmx  Bicycle bmx.front  Wheel bmx.back  Wheel  trek  Bicycle trek.front  Wheel1.2 trek.back  Wheel1.2  owner.bicycles.appendbmx owner.bicycles.appendtrek  owner.validate   checks the structure recursively codepre  pGiven the structure, it is also easy to serialize and deserialize objects. For example, codeowner.jsonifycode may return the dictionaryp  precode     name Eser Aygn,     bicycles [         front              radius 1.0         ,         back              radius 1.0              ,          front              radius 1.2         ,         back              radius 1.2              ],  codepre  pand you can easily convert it back calling codeowner.dejsonifydiccode.p

If I click on an Icon, I would like to replace the content area of the outer control nesting the 6 buttons by an inner control in addition to a small back menu on top of it. The back button could also indicate the location where we are. So it is close to the outlook bar used within microsoft office.p  pI am using androidminSdkVersion8. So I did not take a closer look to the android action bar. I am currently using the tab control. However, the tab control is not really what I want. Or can this be adjusted to provide my described functionality I create controls at runtime, so I can tweek it, if someone knows how to get it close to what I am searching for. As alternative I would appreciate a library, with such a control.p

Negative 1669 pI have a util class that perform some work. Obviously, it is closed for extension and all methods are static.

By the way, method calls helper method codehelpcode to obtain some result and rest of the code use the result returned by codehelpcode method.p  pNow, in client code I want to reuse functionality of method codedoWorkcode, but instead of calling codehelpcode I want to call codehelp2code method. The simplest solution just create method codedoWork2code with replacing codehelpcode to codehelp2code.p  pIt is very bad approach, because every change in codedoWorkcode must be replicated in codedoWork2code either. This very similar to codeTemplate Methodcode pattern, but due to fact that we dont have extension here, we cant apply it.p  pBest solution I came up with to add parameter to this method, but preserve all existing users of codedoWorkcodep  precodepublic static void doWork      doWorkWithParametertrue   public static void doWorkWithParameterboolean helpOrHelp2       some work     int variable  helpOrHelp2  help  help2      some work uses variable  codepre  pWhat are better design solutions can be applied to solve this problem Is there a way to achieve flexibility like codeTemplate Patterncode has, but in application to util classes.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1669 pQuestion Are there any ways of logging or determining where deadlocks occur in an application provided to a client possibly by enabling some flags in the build processp  pBackground Usually when I am testing code and a deadlock occurs, I am running in Visual Studio, so I can hit debug all and find which thread is waiting and where, and I immediately know what the issue is. However, there is a certain issue which causes my application to freeze up very rarely it is not detected in unit or integration tests. This happens on a clients machine where he is only running the executable binary. Im interested in knowing if there are any features I can enable that can help report these issues, since its hard to say exactly would could be the problem without a debugger.p

Negative 1669 pI am an aspiring developer trying to create an app. I have seem to come to a brick wall. I am creating the app for the Android Market, mainly because I dont own a Mac or I would create for both iOS and Android. I cant seem to figure out what plugin to use to make a camera. This is probably something simple and I am overlooking something. But I want to be able to click the rowbutton and the camera turn on. Then once a photo is taken, it directs to another page for options to do with that photo. Is this possible or is it wishful thinking Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank youp

Negative 1669 pI have a managed COM object written in C and a native COM client and sink written in C MFC and ATL.  The client creates the object and advises to its event interface at startup, and unadvises from its event interface and releases the object at shutdown.  The problem is that the COM object has a reference to the sink which is not released until garbage collection runs, at which point the client is already torn down and thus usually results in an access violation.

Negative 1669 pI am trying to perform oneclass classification such that I only have positive data during training time and negative data is only available at testing time. If I use, Oneclass SVM or any other oneclass method, there is a common problem to estimate parameters with crossvalidation approach, because during training phase we dont have negative data. A problem that I feel can occur by estimating parameters using only positive data is overfitting during training or in other words, if we just care about parameters that gives us lowest falsenegative rate, we may end up with parameters with zero falsenegative but high falsepositive rate during testing. p  pMy question is, can you please suggest me a parameter estimation method with CV or refer to any paper that deals with this scenario. Most of the google search and literature review didnt solved my problem. To simplify this problem, many researchers assume some outliers or artificially generate them, but in my case, I cant say anything about the negative concept as I only know what positive data looks like. Your feedback will be appreciated.p

Negative 1669 pConsider this mockup of my intended outputp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuRnvQ.png altIntended structurep  pThe data structure behind this in a Mongo DB looks like this  I did not nest the subcategories inside the document because I still want to be able to update subdocuments atomically  and I also want to allow a dynamic amount of layers below. From what Ive seen, Mongo currently does not allow for easy, dynamic access of nested documents.p  precodetopmostcategory     id  foo,   categoryname  Example,   parentcategory null,   subcatories [ subfoo1, subfoo2, ... ]   childcategory     id  subfoo1,   categoryname  Example 2,   parentcategory foo,   subcategories []  codepre  pThe underlying HTML consists simply of nested branches. The currently selected category gets an active class, and the icons in front are named iconfolderclose and iconfolderopen codelti classiconfolderclosegtltigtcode.p  pNow, I could use the answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15290670howtouserecursivetemplatethisa to create a complete treelike structure. However, all the branches would be open. How do I make it so that only the currently selected branch is visible like shown in my mockup and still have it reactive to bootp

Negative 1669 pIve cloned a repo made sure to mark the original repo as codeupstreamcode and went the gitflow way create a codedevelopcode branch from which all new features are created and commited back to. Every push to codeMastercode from codedevelopcode is by definition a release, meaning codemastercode is always deployable. I like this setup a lot. p  pNow sometimes aside from this flow I may want to contribute back to codeupstreamcode some feature that I keep in separate featurebranches. However since a featurebranch is created from codedevelop HEADcode and codedevelopcode may have already had other featurebranches merged back into, this gives a problem p  ul limerging the specific codefeature branchcode back into my own codedevelopcode is okli libut Im not sure how to do a clean pullrequest from this codefeature branchcode. I.e without all the codechanges of codeprevious feature branchescode that were merged into codedevelopcode before I started the current codefeature branchcode. I hope this makes sense.li ul  pIm pretty sure coderebasingcode doesnt help, since this only updates my local feature branch with commits of codeupstreamcode that happened in the meantime. It doesnt help to clean the local feature branch with inherited code changes from codedevelopcode. p  pSo, how to do thisp

Negative 1669 pI am building a 3D flower mesh through a series of extrusions Working in Unity 4 environment. For each flower there are splines that define each branch, petals, leaves etc. Around each spline there is a shape that is being extruded along that spline. And a thickness curve that defines at each point in the spline, how thick the shape could be.p  pI am trying to animate this mesh using parameters i.e. look towards sun, bend with the wind.p  pI have been working on this for nearly two months and my algorithm boiled down to basically reconstructing the flower every frame, by iterating over the shape for each spline point, transforming it into the the current space and calculating new vertex positions out of it, a version of parallel transport frames.p  pfor each vertexp  precodev  p  q  e  w codepre  pwhere p  precodep  point on the path e  vertex position in the local space of shape being extruded q  quaternion to transform into the local space of the p by its direction towards next path point w  width at point p codepre  pI believe this is as small of a step as it gets to extrude the model. I need to do this once for each vertex in the model basically.p  pI hit the point where this is too slow for my current scene. I need to have 56 flowers with total around 60k vertices and I concluded that this is the bottleneck.p  pI can see that this is a similar problem to skeletal animation, where each joint would control a crosssection of the extruded shape. It is not a direct question but Im wondering if someone can elaborate on whether I can steal some techniques from skeletal animation to speed up the process. In my current perspective, I just dont see how I can avoid at least one calculation per vertex, and in that case, I just choose to rebuild the mesh every frame.p

Negative 1669 pI am currently automating some PowerPoint 2010 functions in Groovy using Scriptom  though this problem may be generic to any PowerPoint automation approach ie more of a VBA macro issue than the particular environment Im using.p  pScriptom allows you to use ActiveX or COM Windows components from Groovy.  Underneath the hood it uses the Jacob library Java COM Bridge, I believe. The underlying code is similar to what Id use in a VBA macro or other Microsoft automation component, and is based on the PowerPoint 2010 Object API.p  pMy current code works well and opens PowerPoint visibly and does a range of functions on it  except for a component where I copy and paste slides from one document to another, keeping source formatting.  p  pI have tried two attemps to do this copy and paste step, both leading to a different problem.  I wonder if anyone has thoughts on solving either or both of these problemsp  pstrongMethod 1strong  I use a basic copy and paste methods, suggested by various others, namelyp  precodesourceSlide.Copy destinationSlide  destinationPresentation.Slides.PasteslideIndexi1 destinationSlide.Design  sourceSlide.Design destinationSlide.ColorScheme  sourceSlide.ColorScheme destinationSlide.FollowMasterBackground  sourceSlide.FollowMasterBackground ... and so on copying formats... codepre  pThat is, I manually copy all the formats across to keep slideformatting.  This is the method used prior to PowerPoint 2010.  Ive actually got this working, however to copy the formats I loop over each slide in the source slidepack and do the copypaste code above.  In this loop, the following line alone is problematicp  blockquote   pdestinationSlide.Design  sourceSlide.Designp blockquote  pThis line runs incredibly slowly once the destination SlidePack has a large number of Designs in the SlideMaster.  I am copying a source slidepack of 19 slides, each of which has a different SlideMaster Design Theme thats how it comes to me.  This single line of code takes about 0.01 seconds for copying the emfirstem slide over, but by the time it comes to the emfinalem slide in the loop, the single line of code takes over 20 seconds to run each time.  Thus, copying the first five slides might take lt1 second, but the total 20 slides takes around 100 seconds in total, with all the latter slides taking longer and longer to run just this single line.  The rest of the code races by  p  pThe slowdown isnt linear, and gets even worse beyond 20 slides.  It isnt related to the content on the final slides, but seems to be that as the number of SlideMaster designsthemes increases it slows exponentially to copy across the sourceSlide.Design.  I realise having a different Design object for each slide is a bit of a waste, but I dont own the initial source presentation, and often they do come to me like this, with just slight difference between the Designs for each slide.  If I remove the destinationSlide.Design line the time it takes can reduce from 100 seconds to around 1 secondp  pstrongMethod 2strong  In order to avoid this, and given Im using PowerPoint 2010, I tried to use the following code, insteadp  precodesourceSlide.Copy  def destinationPresentation  objPpt.Presentations.OpendestinationFilename destinationPresentation.CommandBars.ExecuteMsoPasteSourceFormatting codepre  pI believe this should provide direct access to PowerPoint 2010 Paste with Source Formatting functionality.  However, this fails with a codenull pointer exceptioncode at the codeExecuteMsoPasteSourceFormattingcode line.p  pWhat am I doing wrong  Is there any way to speed up the slow line in Method 1  Why is method 2 not working at all  It looks like destinationPresentation.CommandBars is not null, but that the ExecuteMso line throws a null pointer exception.  p  pAre there any other suggestions for efficiently copy and paste slides that should work in a reasonable time frame for 20100 slides, even if there are multiple different designsthemesp  pThanks, in advance, for any ideas.p

It is possible and not too hard to set up a private instance of this service. I give it a URL and I get a performance report of the loading of that page. However, it doesnt allow me to monitor the application while I am interacting with it  which is vital  especially in a single page web application with a lot of stuff going on on the clientside  like mine.p  h23 a hrefhttpwww.compuware.comenusapplicationperformancemanagementproductsajaxfreeeditionoverview.htmlCompuware APM AJAX Editiona formerly DynaTrace AJAX Editionh2  pCompuware APM AJAX Edition is free as in gratis proprietary software that uses browser plugins to capture information from the browser while browsing, meaning it can automatically gather data during a Selenium test suite execution.p  pIts pretty easy to automate it and integrate the execution of it into a continuous integration process, but the reporting leaves a lot to be desired. Test results are grouped into sessions which is the period from the browser window is opened until it is closed. There is no functionality for comparing test results over time, which makes it hard to track progress and catch regressions.p  pCompuware APM AJAX Edition is the best alternative Ive seen so far  but there has to be something better out there  emrightemp

Negative 1669 pSuppose we have a collection of interdependent C modules and we want to create a GNU Makefile for emseparate compilationem of them for a few different builds e.g., unit tests, user tools, multiple editions.p  pEach module, while being essential for the complete application, is intended to be used separately or in any reasonable combination with other modules  always exposing the most featured API resulting from the availability of components provided by other modules selected for a particular build.p  pFor the sake of a minimal and complete example, lets assume that our program has three modules red, green and blue with all possible conditional functionalities toggled by means of emconditional compilationem. Each module has two such conditional blocks, each of which enabled by the presence of one of two possible neighbours. This gives us three possible single builds Red, Green, Blue, three double builds Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and one triple build White  each containing a dedicated main program Core built on top of the set of profided features. p  pstrongDesired situationstrongp  pnbspnbsp img srchttpabramowicz.infographicsbuilds0.png altdesired situationp  pFigure 1 shows the three modules codemodred.ccode, codemodgreen.ccode and codemodblue.ccode RGB three areas of crossmodule functionality cyan, magenta and yellow CMY implemented emwithinem the adjacent modules and three cores white, with physical dependencies RGB on big, sharpened tops and logical dependencies CMY on small tops. Each direction out of six denotes a functionality aspect, so the CMY tops pointing out of the main triangle suggest that the synergy may provide additional features.p  pThe desired Makefile is expected to provide recipes for all possible builds, thus use four versions of each of the three modules and seven different cores. It should also be smart enough to avoid brutal solution full block of codegcccode commands for each recipe and to keep the advantages of separate compilation.p  pWithout separate compilation the problem is easy at least for unilateral dependencies main program includes necessary sources and the dependent blocks are enabled by preprocessor flags, e.g. those set by other modules include guards. With separate compilation, however, the set of modules comprising a particular build is unknown to the compiler.p  pstrongManual approachstrongp  pThe desired situation could be achieved manually with the shell commands listed below.p  precode Single objects gcc c o modgreen.o modgreen.c   Double objects gcc c include modblue.h o modredB.o modred.c gcc c include modred.h o modblueR.o modblue.c   Triple objects gcc c include modgreen.h include modblue.h o modredGB.o modred.c gcc c include modred.h include modblue.h o modgreenRB.o modgreen.c gcc c include modred.h include modgreen.h o modblueRG.o modblue.c   Builds gcc o green green.c modgreen.o gcc o magenta magenta.c modredB.o modblueR.o gcc o white white.c modredGB.o modgreenRB.o modblueRG.o codepre  pAs for the desired situation, this example shows only the three representative builds Green, Magenta and White. Others are formed analogously.p  pstrongClassic approachstrongp  pnbspnbsp img srchttpabramowicz.infographicsbuilds1.png altcurrent situationp  pWith a classic Makefile solution the Green build stays the same, but the other two have missing logical dependencies i.e., the CMYprovided symbols. It is so because the building process is currently and usually defined as followsp  precodewhite white.c modred.o modgreen.o modblue.o     gcc o    magenta magenta.c modblue.o modred.o      gcc o    green green.c modgreen.o     gcc o    .o .c     gcc c o  lt codepre  pHere the problem is clearly exposed the last rule does not distinguish between particular builds  the context is lost.

There is a button not in the tabbed pane which adds an item to the list. The tabbed pane does NOT create all the elements of the pane. It creates only the elements of the visible pane and deletes them when the pane is switched away. Therefore, the list may or may not exist.p
Negative 1669 pI want to develop an application with two main widgets one is a text editor and the other one is for graphic viewer.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCBdYR.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe basic idea is to let the user hover over any block of code in the text area and the associated part of the drawing gets selected or highlighted.p  pFor the graphic widget, after some research it seems QGraphicsScene fits the requirements the most, but Im not sure what widget to use for the text editor such that it gives me a signal when hovering over any block of code and also send a string parameter id of the block.p  pThe reverse action is required too, so when the user choose to inspect element in the graphics view the text view is scrolled to view the associate block of code and highlight it like in Google Chrome Inspect Element feature.p

Negative 1669 pI recently moved to a new machine Win7  64 bit, and installed the GTest plugin in Visual Studio 2010.  If I try to use any of the plugin options, for example, Execute All Tests with GoogleTest, I get an error  the system cannot find the file specified.  The project runs fine if I press the Visual Studio run button.p  pIm guessing this is because my Debug configuration is set to Platformx64, and the output from the build is going into emx64Debugem directory instead of the emDebugem directory. When I used to run this on my 32 bit machine, I never ran into this problem with either Debug or Release configuration.p  pIf this is the problem, it I suppose I could change the configuration to output the files into Debug, but that seems klugey.  Any advice on how to fix thisp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI confirmed that changing the output directory to the configuration name fixed the error.  So the only question left is whether there is a better way to configure the GTEST plugin to run the EXE from whatever output directory is specified in the configuration.p

Negative 1669 pI have a view that has two tables. In the story board, I have two separate views, one horizontal and the other vertical.

It adds up all of the cell heights and makes the first table the appropriate height, then moves the second table 50  pixels below the first table.

Negative 1669 pI am looking for a design pattern of  what I call  matrix inheritance. To better explain the problem Ill describe an example.p  pGiven I want to model linux system packages in a general way. I have a base class named codePackagecode and its derivatives like codeApache2code, codePHP5code, etc. Now these classes contain all the methods to ensure this packages are installed and configured the way I want to them to be. But these classes should be usable on several different operating systems like Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, other Linux distributions and if possible Windows.p  pIt seems to me like this could be solved with some kind of a inheritance matrix where the effective class is inherited including mixins from the base package class to provide foundational methods and mixins to extend andor override methods from additional classesmodulesinterfacesprotocols to eventually provide the functionality for an automated installation on the specific system used to mixin.p  pI am trying to build this in ruby, but what I am more interested in is the general design pattern to apply to the system to realize this.p  pAlso I am sure that there is already an existing design pattern or a combination of those to get what I want, I just cant seem to find clean solution to this problem on my own.p  pAs an added bonus or even alternative I am wondering if the problem is probably easier to solve using a functional point of view instead of an object oriented approach and how this would look like.p

Negative 1669 pIm quite new to strongAndroidstrong and there is a goal I want to achieve but I cant find a proper solution at the moment.p  pIm developing in Android and I need an Activity that displays a emtwo dimensional grid of 2D rectanglesem with round corners. The size of the grid gets determined emat runtimeem and forwarded from the parent Activity. That means I also have to emcreate the rectangles at runtimeem. As the rectangles also need a custom behaviour I tried the followingp  pI did write my own class and did inherit from View. In the codeonDrawcode method I defined how the rectangle should look like, even though at the beginning I wanted to define the look in a ShapeDrawable XML file and load it in the construction of my custom rectangle. That didnt work well. Now Im stuck, because when I try to add my view to the layout assined to the activity to display the grid, I get errors. When I set one of those rectangles directly with codesetContentViewrectanglecode it gets displayed somewhere in the middle of the screen.p  pSo my questions arep  ul lipIs it the right way to create these rectangles by inheriting from View keep in mind that I have to modify the way the are drawn when the user does click on a rectangle and I want to open a menu later when a rectangle gets clickedpli lipWhats the best way to display these rectangles Which kind of layout should I use when I wanted display them in a gridlike fashion The user should later also be able to delete some rectangles.

Negative 1669 pmy current workflow to deploy code is to branch a releases branch from master when i believe the code is in a stable state. on my production side, i do a simple codegit fetch origincode and than check out my code via codegit checkout originreleasesv1.0code or whatever the release number is at that time. at this point my head is detached. so to avoid this, i just do something like codegit checkout b releasesv1.0 originreleasesv1.0code. makes my codegit statuscode look much better. to date, this has never been an issue of course i do no modifications in this git repo.p  pi am essentially creating what ill call leaf branches correct term. idk. with my releases. i just found that codegit checkout t ltbranchgtcode will in fact do the checkout and creation of the local branch with the name i am looking for. however, it is setting up the upstream configuration that i dont need. p  pso based on my deployment processp  ol liDoes it really matter if i have a detached head if i just checkout from remote via codegit checkout originreleasesv1.0codeli liSince my process does not lend itself to pushing any code from my production server, does it make sense to codegit checkout b releasesv1.0 originreleasesv1.0code or have it actually tracked via codegit checkout t originreleasesv1.0code li ol

Negative 1669 pI created a Scala application which reads information from a handful of sources and outputs it as an XML file, using codescala.xml.PrettyPrintercode. This file has to confirm to a XML Schema, because I also wrote an R script which will consume a file implementing the schema. p  pThe schema contains a few enumerations, and the validation fails with messages like p  prexmllint noout studiesclean.xml schema ..litsuchesatisfaction.xsd  studiesclean.xml 9 element satisfactionCorrelation Schemas validity error   Element httprumtschodissertationlitusersatsatisfactionCorrelation  [facet enumeration] The value          observed user reactions        is not an element of the set satisfaction, usability,  product quality, task process quality, absence of negative reactions,  task result quality, expectation disconfirmation, preference for a version,  enjoyment, observed user reactions, technology acceptance, likelihood of  referral, user state, attribute performance, user choice of action, time  spent doing a task, users impression of the system, impact of IS,  user characteristics, organisation context, task parameters, need fit,  cost, cognitive load. pre  pAs you can see, codeobserved user reactionscode is a member of my enumeration, but the same string with leading and trailing whitespace isnt getting recognized. This whitespace gets inserted by the pretty printer another line where the value is codeusabilitycode gets printed on a single row, and the validator doesnt complain there. p  pUsing the noblanks option of xmllint doesnt change anything. p  pI dont know what to change so that the whole thing works. I see two alternatives p  ol liI could stop using the pretty printer and instead use a formatter which removes all white space between elements from my Node before writing it to a file. This should validate, but if I ever have to open the file to check things manually, the absence of line breaks will be problematic. li liI could try to rewrite the XML schema to accept whitespace before and after the text of an enumeration element. li liI could try to somehow get xmllint to not pay attention to whitespace issues while validating. li ol  pOptions 2 and 3 also require me to make R trim any text while loading, but this is a oneline change. So I strongly prefer to use one of them. p  pstrongMy questionsstrong p  ol liIs option 3 possible at all Does xmllint have an option to ignore whitespace while validating If yes, how is it turned on If no, is an alternative tool which can validate my file quickly with a shell command li liIs option 2 possible at all Does XML Schema allow to mix a whitespace facet and an enumeration facet probably a newb question, but this is the first time I have ever written a schema li liAm I overlooking some drawback to Option 2 andor 3 which would make Option 1 a better solution li ol  pemupdate in response to a commentem This is the pretty printer output. It has inserted line breaks around the long value, but not around the short one. I think that this is normal behavior for a pretty printer, but even if it werent, the API doesnt include an option to stop it from inserting these breaks. p  precodeltstsatisfactionCorrelationsgt   ltstsatisfactionCorrelationgt     observed user reactions   ltstsatisfactionCorrelationgt   ltstsatisfactionCorrelationgtusabilityltstsatisfactionCorrelationgt ltstsatisfactionCorrelationsgt codepre

Negative 1669 pMy company is currently running SQL Server 2000, and about to make the jump to SQL Server 2012, but before we move the upgrade, we want to try and clear up a performance issue that has recently cropped up and is plaguing our ability to do business.p  pA few months ago we decided that we wanted to add a text field to one of our sql server tables to try and capture a specific event. I thought Id try and add the column during the day, which in retrospect was probably the first mistake, but I figured if people were using the table, SQL Server wouldnt allow me to add the column. On this attempt, the extra column was accepted and added to the table. I then coded our Access front end to write to this new column.p  pSoon after, users started experiencing the Access GUI locking up, and eventually throwing a query time out error.p  pHeres how the error occurs. After clicking a save button in an Access front end, which would then build a TSQL statement in VBA to update or save a new record, users would not see an Access message box saying that the save completed successfully or that an error had occurred. Instead they would get a Access system dialogue box that said there was a query time out. At this time I deleted the column that I added, hoping that would fix the issue.p  pI started analysis by having everyone close their Access program, then have the person who was experiencing problems reopen and try to save again. This worked for that user, and I would allow everyone else back into the system at this time. Of course I wasnt sure why this worked at the time, so I tried looking more into the issue. Further analysis led me to spwho2. Running this would give me all the users and the SPID of who was blocking. This gave me a quicker way of getting things working again because I could kill the offending SPID and allow everyone else to continue working. Of course the kill results in a rollback, so not all data is being saved and I have to tell the owner of the killed process that they must reenter all their data a second time. To date, I continuously monitor this database in this way, and if I find something blocked, this is how I fix it.p  pI know the problem is with a single table in this database, first because trouble only started after I tried to enter a new column, but also because every time a save or update is performed, it locks when writing to this particular table. At the time, I diagnosed this because I asked my users what action they were trying to perform, and in all cases, they were trying to do something to this particular table. In fact, changes to other tables in this same Db execute with no issues. So I felt the problem may be related to corruption to this table.p  pFirst thing I did was run a CHECKDB and CHECKTABLE, but neither of these returned an issue with the table. So we decided to rebuild the table. I rebuilt the table by hand, then copied the data over from the original table to the new table. I believe I used a sql tool for this, but I may have run an insert into. Its been a while and I didnt document. Either way, it didnt work. The organization continued to experience blocking. So then I reindexed the table, and that seemed to work, for about a day, and then the error came back. Since then I found INPUTBUFFER, which I was running on the SPID of the blocking user every time for a while. Almost every time, the INPUTBUFFER would return a SELECT statement, though I dont think thats what was throwing the block. I dont think the SELECT was throwing the block because in the Access GUI what happens is you hit the save button, it runs a save or update, then it runs a select to refresh the Access screen. I would think that if the SELECT was throwing the block that the save would have happened, but when recalling the record after the process starts blocking, and the process is killed, the user changes are never saved to the record. Im not entirely sure how INPUTBUFFER works. I know it supposedly returns the last statement sent to SQL Server, but if the save didnt commit, could Access still be sending SQL to SQL Serverp  pI will also add that I never seem to throw a block when Im working in SQL Server Management Studio itself. I have obviously felt the repercussions of an existing block which will hang my sql statement, but Ive never thrown a block to my knowledge. To that end Ive also updated the ODBC connectors from every user to 10.0. This doesnt seem to have a negative or positive impact on the issue.p  pSo Im not sure what to do next. Any suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 1669 pI am trying to get a gallery working and I am trying to limit the usage of jQuery in this case. As shown in the following screenshot, I always have 2 items beside each other a hrefhttpprntscr.com2gpi01 relnofollowhttpprntscr.com2gpi01a . They are set to float left and whenever one is removed or set to display none, another item simply takes its place.

I have seen this quite often online, that by simply removing an item, another item slides smoothly into its new place. Is this somehow possible with CSS3 transitionsp

Negative 1669 pIm working with an old 1.5.26 Joomla installation.

I tested it in several computers with several web browsers even with an iPad and it seems to work fine. I was happy... until I moved on to production and allowed real users to access it.p  pTotal and complete disaster. Many users a lot of them are getting the error message, jFactorygetUser returns a 0 for them. I use their usernames and passwords to try it and it works fine. They try from their end and it doesnt.p  pThis only happens when I embed the script within the wrapper. If I let the users access the web application through a direct link to the application directory, the problem vanishes.p  pDoes anyone have the slightest idea of why this could happenp  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 1669 pIn my PHP script I need to create an array of 600k integers. Unfortunately my webservers codememorylimitcode is set to 32M so when initializing the array the script aborts with message p  blockquote   pstrongFatal errorstrong Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted tried to allocate 71 bytes in stronghomewwwmyaccounthtmlmemtest.phpstrong on line strong8strongp blockquote  pI am aware of the fact, that PHP does not store the array values as plain integers, but rather as zvalues which are much bigger than the plain integer value 8 bytes on my 64bit system. I wrote a small script to estimate how much memory each array entry uses and it turns out, that its pretty exactly 128 bytes. 128 Id need 73M just to store the array. Unfortunately the webserver is not under my control so I cannot increase the codememorylimitcode.p  pMy question is, is there any possibility in PHP to create an arraylike structure that uses less memory. I dont need this structure to be associative plain indexaccess is sufficient. It also does not need to have dynamic resizing  I know exactly how big the array will be. Also, all elements would be of the same type. Just like a good old Carray.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong So a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers476deceze titledecezedecezeas solution works outofthebox with 32bit integers. But even if youre on a 64bit system, a hrefhttpphp.netpackpacka does not seem to support 64bit integers. In order to use 64bit integers in my array I applied some bitmanipulation. Perhaps the below snippets will be of help for someonep  precodefunction pushbackampstorage, value       split the 64bit value into two 32bit chunks, then pass these to pack.     storage . packll, valuegtgt32, value   function getampstorage, idx       read two 32bit chunks from storage and glue them back together.     return currentunpackl, substrstorage, idx  8, 4ltlt32              currentunpackl, substrstorage, idx  84, 4  codepre

Negative 1669 pCan JAXB be used as the marshaller for Grails  My domain classes are JAXB annotated Java classes and GORM is currently marshalling them but not distinguishing between empty and null strings.  JAXB can make this distinction, so I would like to use JAXB if possible.p  pJAXB is being used on the client side and Im trying to get these Java objects from the server to the client without changing them, but GORM causes null strings to become empty strings.p  pHow can I setup JAXB to replace the Grails marshalling  Any answer should include an example where there are a list of objects of the same type and they get marshalled together in some wrapper element as this happens on an index action and is common in my application.  The name of the tag of the wrapper element is less important.  Grails uses list, which works with JAXB, but other marshallers Ive seen use the plural of the object type, which also works with JAXB.p

Because I did not build the libraries used in my application at all. Only application was built with memwatch.c  and memwatch.h.  So the problem is that memory mwMalloc was created in the my application code and freed by a library. So, in my opinion, memwatch has this shortcoming because all libraries should be built with memwatch support again.  But this is almost impossible. I think that, for speed, mtrace glibc builtin will be better or valgrind  can be used for some cases.p

Negative 1669 pone probably easy question that I for some reason cannot see the answer top  pI am working on a Matlab Project where I need to interpolate a specific set of data. I have a 2DMatrix MAT and two Vectors X and Y that assign a value to each column and row strictly monotonically increasing of course. The Matrix is mostly 0s, except for some diagonal lines amongst which it has nonzero values. p  pI now wish to interpolate the data along thise lines over the entire area, a linear Interpolation should be enough for now. My approach isp  precode[y,x]  meshgridY,X Create a Meshgrid out of the grid vectors ySaveyxSavex M  MAT Now, we eliminate the Elements where MAT is 0 since we want to interpolate there yMAT0[] xMAT0[] MMAT0[] interpolant  scatteredInterpolanty,x,M  and we create our Interpolant result  interpolantySave,xSave codepre  pHowever, when I execute this code, the interpolated Picture not only does not resemble the intuitive interpolation at all  it does not even have the original data points included... what am I doing wrongp  pThanks for the helpp  pEdit from Comments, for visibility imgur.coma7baxM This is the visual respresentation of the data. Top picture is the interpolated result, bottom one the input data. There are no values close to zero, and as you can tell, the pictures are far from similar. It looks a bit like the correct interpolation got streched weirdly or something...p

Negative 1669 pI have a bunch of Eclipsebased plugins that I have been migrating to MavenTycho. Most of these plugins depend on separate libraries that I now manage through Maven, rather than muddle around with code.jarcode files.p  pThe most cumbersome part of my current setup is due to the apparent inability of Tycho to process Mavenonly i.e. nonOSGi artifacts. My current setup works like thisp  ol lipIn the codepom.xmlcode of each Eclipse plugin I issue an codeunpackcode goal to codemavendependencyplugincode during the codeinitializecode phase. This unpacks the artifacts that I specify to a separate codetargetdependenciescode directory.pli lipThe codetargetdependenciescode directory is added as an output directory in codebuild.propertiescode, so that Tycho can add it to the classpath when compilingp  precodesource..  srcmainjava output..  targetclasses output..  targetdependencies codepreli lipThe codetargetdependenciescode directory is added to the codeBundleClassPathcode library in codeMETAINFMANIFEST.MFcode.pli ol  pThese settings allow the codecompilecode Maven directive to compile the plugin. Importing the project from VCS and manually specifying the codetargetdependenciescode directory as a class folder in Eclipse allows said IDE to also compile the plugin.p  pUnfortunately this is a rather cumbersome solution for a few reasonsp  ul lipConfiguring the codemavendependencyplugincode requires listing all artifacts that should be unpacked. One emcouldem use codeunpackdependenciescode instead of codeunpackcode, but that would also unpack all OSGi dependencies  having half of Eclipse unpacked in each project directory is not my idea of fun...pli lipAdding the class folder in Eclipse requires Maven codeinitializecode to be run once, so that the codetargetdependenciescode directory is created.pli lipThere is no source connection between the pure Maven projects and their depending Tycho projects in Eclipse. For a change to propagate from a Maven project to an Tycho project, so that e.g. Eclipse may show a potential compilation problem, one has to codemvn installcode the Maven project and then run codemvn clean initializecode in the Tycho project to remove the previously unpacked dependencies and pull in the current set. Then you have to refresh the Eclipse project and hope that Eclipse does the right thing.p  pIn the same vein, viewing the source of a dependency from a Tycho project will emnotem show the primary source file, but rather whatever is available in codetargetdependenciescode  quite possibly just a code.classcode file.pli ul  pI am thinking that there must be a more reasonable way to go about this  something that would allow Eclipse and Maven projects to integrate more tightly.p  pSo, what am I missing What is the recommended setup for this use case Is there a better alternative Preferably something that would not require setting a bunch of Nexus andor p2 repositoriesp

Negative 1669 pI have a Script that enabled Lync users from a CSV and puts the SIP address and users name into a text.

Maybe what i am trying to do is than what Lync can do or maybe i am going about this wrong. Any insight would be awesome.p

I ran across this problem when I was testing out the Amelia libraries for multiple imputation and wanted to look at what the spread of the moments of the simulations were from the longterm means.  The object they return is shaped like this, and has the properties described above of corresponding to the original data frame, and with no missing data.p  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.committenchops9866880 relnofollowHeres a gista I put together fiddling with it.p  pI like user20650s answer did not require additional copying imputer2 in the gist, so when I started expanding onto a list of 1000, it became significantly faster than the ones that required merging new data frames.  p  pWhat was kind of quirky and I havent entirely resolved are that I was that running imputer1 versus imputer2 was producing values that looked identical, but for which a  b were false.  I assume a roundoff issue.  p  pIm also still looking for a way to apply general functions like mean or sd over this construct without copying rather than computing them itemwise, but anyway my problem is solved and Ill leave that to another question.p

Negative 1669 pI am working on an App which is meant to use the Renderscript Support Library. For development Android Studio 0.5.4 and Gradle 1.11 is used.p  pTo configure renderscript I usep  precodeandroid      compileSdkVersion 19     buildToolsVersion 19.0.3      defaultConfig          minSdkVersion 10         targetSdkVersion 19         renderscriptTargetApi 19         renderscriptSupportMode true        codepre  pThis works on 2.3 and 4.4.2.p  pAfter my first screen I wanted to write a few tests to document. Atm I use ActivityUnitTestCase as the ancestor for the tests.. My test code is in srcandroidTestjava and is identified by Android Studio as a src directory. I can also successfully start the test case using a real device. The test case itself just verifies the existence of a few views. However the tests fail because ofp  precodejava.lang.IllegalAccessError Class ref in preverified class resolved to unexpected implementation codepre  pFurther down in the stack trace I see that its triggered shortly before the first renderscript invocation. Having a look inside the generated not obfuscated apk shows that the Instrumentation Test apk contains the android.support.v8.renderscript package.p  pSo the exception arises because both the apk under test and the test include the renderscript package.p  pMy Question How to prevent itp  pI use several libraries and they do not appear in the test apk. Just the renderscript library does with both dex files and shared objects. I assume its due to its deep native complexity that its treated differently than libraries like nineoldandroids etc.p  pMy GoogleFu revealed that there are only workarounds, one of them being a hrefhttpwww.sinking.inblogandroiddependencydoubletrouble relnofollowhttpwww.sinking.inblogandroiddependencydoubletroublea Which also mentions the inheritent problem a hrefhttpissues.gradle.orgbrowseGRADLE784 relnofollowhttpissues.gradle.orgbrowseGRADLE784ap  pBut non of the fixes mentioned there apply to the renderscript lib.p  pIm thankful for any hint.

Negative 1669 pI am developing in iOS with Parse. My app required offline operation, so I had developed my own  solution. However, Parses introduction of the LocalDataStore obviates the need for my own solution. Since this is not released in iOS yet, I can only rely on documentation to prepare for this. I asked these questions on the Parse forum a week ago and the questions have been completely ignored by Parse. Can anyone answer these via experience with the Android versionp  p1 Objects pointed to by pointers and PFRelations will be pinned along with the pinned object. Thats correct, right Will PFFiles be pinned along with the object Will the file data be locally availablep  p2 When a pinned object is modified, you have to SaveEventually it to push the changes to the Server, right Does a Save on a pinned object save locally Or does it do an online savep  p3 When changes occur elsewhere to a pinned object, how do those changes get propagated to the pinned object in the LocalDataStore Does the programmer have to explicit fetch the changes, or will it happen automaticallyp  p4 Does the concept of logging in apply to the LDS Do the ACLs operate in the LDS Or does the local code have access to all objects in the LDSp  pBobp

Negative 1669 pIf you open up a class with a codepublis static void mainString[] args code method in Eclipse and hit run, then that class will run.

Negative 1669 pI belong to a newly setup college, and have teachers who are not so talented. I personally have spotted them making mistakes many times. This is because they themselves have false knowledge.   Hence I teach programming and networking to myself. As I cannot rely on them.p  pNow since this is the scenario, I have fallen into a big doubt.p  pOne of my teachers of the subject Analysis Of Algorithms, had said, when int main returns 0, all the buffers are closed, all the resources utilized are cleared off, and space is created for other programs. Hence it is a good practise to return 0.  To which I argued, mam, we always knew that it is only to indicate that the program has completed exexution successfully To which she said, you are partly correct.p  pWhich clearly means she meant returning a non zero doesnt release resources.p  pNow who is correct, I or she Should I ask for a money backp

Negative 1669 pTo make a highly scalable and highly available website I am considering authenticating user using no database calls. Here is how I imagine it could be done. Basically, a url is generated on the server for each hashusernamepassword. The url serves an encrypted XML containing user information. It is presented below in more details. Can you review this procedure and let me know if you find any hole, issues or advice.p  ol liWhen a user registers with an email  password combination, create codehashemail amp passwordcode. For example the hash could be code5541c7b5a06c39b267a5efae6628e003code.li licreate a url on the server codehttpnodbauth.com5541c7b5a06c39b267a5efae6628e003code which returns xml content.li liThe javascript client includes a crypto library such as a hrefhttpscode.google.compcryptojs relnofollowhttpscode.google.compcryptojsa.li liThe javascript client prompts for email  password, calculates the hash and http get the codehttpnodbauth.com5541c7b5a06c39b267a5efae6628e003code url. Only the user is able to calculate this hash, because only the user knowns the password  email combination required to do so. So this url should only be known by the user. These urls are not published.li liThe contain of the url is an xml file containing private user information. The xml file is always encrypted using aes256 and decrypted by the javascript client.li ol  pPROSp  pNo databases are required to authenticate the user.p  pThe xml file can be pushed using cloudfront to users worldwide, resulting very fast responses.p  pThe xml file can be duplicated accross many servers, making the system very scalable.p  pThe system does not need downtime.p  pCONSp  pWhen the user saves a change to his private information name, email or password, a new file has to be created and distributed on the cloudfront network which might take a few seconds. So writes are slower.p  pNongoalp  pI am not trying to do a full database replacement. Only basic user information that changes rarely would be part of this system such as phone, email, password, name, address, etc.p

Negative 1669 pstrongNote TCPNODELAY didnt seem to solve the issue described below.strongp  pstrongThe Main issuestrong TCP sockets have bad latency 100ms unless theyre streaming data constantly. If I send a message normally, the latency is 100ms or worse. I tried sending garbage data at regular intervals every 0.05 seconds and putting my actual messages in between, and the latency improved immensely. p  pstrongThe Questionstrong Why do TCP messages have a bad latency when theyre sent alone, but they have good latency when the socket is streaming large amounts of datap  pstrongSome other thingsstrong p  pI tried Datagrams UDP and I still got a bad latency. p  pMy lan ping is pretty bad between computers, which may be related. Ive got an Apple Aiport Express. Ive also tried creating wireless networks directly between my Macs, but I still get a bad ping. This may or may not be related. I dont know if its just the result of the ping command having a really low priority or not. It seems to be consistent with the socket latency though.p
Negative 1669 pI need to create a javascript application that can display the content from another domain admittedly another big website. Further interpretation of the DOM tree is not needed at the moment. It will be used by only ten more people. p  pI can make it work via phps getcontent function. But that is very slow since it runs on the server side. I looked into any origin but cannot get it to work. It is best to not touch any origin since we use it extensively and we dont have much cash to spend around. Can anyone help By the way, iframe is not an option since the big website blocked it. The code is below. Admittedly I kind of took it from another stackoverflow answer. Thank you in advancep  pBtw. another engineer told me if I use the extension .hta instead of html, the sameorigin policy issue would be resolved. I tried it and it did not work.

Negative 1669 pI have a question. Im implementing a password recovery, then I thought What if a stranger makes an unauthorized password recovery, changing someones else password So, my first decision is Ill set two fields in the user table, called password and temppassword. If the real user asks for a password recovery, the new random password will be stored in temppassword and an email will be sent. In this way, a spiteful user wont change anyone else password and the email owner can deny the password change attempt. Is that right Thank you in advance for your help. Greetingsp

Negative 1669 pSo I have a bunch of methods, all of which take in various parameters of different data types, what im trying to achieve is a way to call into another method, passing in all the parameters that the current method takes in as well as its values, and in that method i will eventually be doing different types of validation based on the data type of the parameter. The idea being that I will have one validation method that I will be able to call at the beginning of each method, rather than going through each method and validating the parameters one at a time within each method. Below is a rough outline of what im trying to achieve, ive looked around and seem to found some uses with Reflection, but it seems passing the parameter types as well as their values is a bit trickier and was wondering if anyone else had come into a similar form of problem.p  precodepublic void doStuffAint a, string b, string c, bool d      var params       if validateInputparams               do stuff        public void doStuffBstring x, string y, int z      var params       if validateInputparams               do stuff        public bool validateInput params       do validation  codepre

Negative 1669 pI had this issue with a website that was built with DNN where the navigation menu stayed hidden behind an iframe on internet explorer. pAfter a short search on the net, I found the problem was due to how IE processed windowed and windowless elements.

Negative 1669 pWe are using a TreeView control in an MVVM C WPF application.p  pI have successfully added ExpandCollapse All functionality to the View  iterating through all the Items in the TreeView, setting IsExpanded and then calling Focus on the TreeView to refresh the changes.p  pI have also successfully added functionality to clear the currently selected Item in the TreeView when clicking the empty space in the TreeView.p  pMy current task and problem is to automatically select any newly added Items in the TreeView.

Negative 1669 pI have an application in which the person who designed the application had used a dbml to manage db classes. But we have another database that we often need to connect to and weve been using ado.net normally to connect to it as we cannot use same dbml for it.

Negative 1669 pIm using MakBox for iOS 1.4.1 SDK in my iPhone app with Objective C. In updating my app for XCode 6 and iOS 8 I added the NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription item to my plist settings.  I tested and did not receive any location updates.  I then added the NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription key and that enabled updates to flow.  My question is Since I dont need location services when the app isnt running Id like to just use the WhenInUse permission but MapBox doesnt appear to work.  So, if forced to use AlwaysUsage Apple throws the scary waring permission question about the app using location services even when the app is running.p  pAm I missing something herep  pEdit  My location updates come from my RMMapViewDelegate methods.  If I use the NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription and the user allows always permission I get the updates.  If I use the NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription I get nothing.br Edit  I added CLLocationManagerDelegate to my VC and properly spelled NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription and if I call [self.locationManager requestWhenInUseAuthorization] I will get the prompt and WhenInUse location updates will work.p

Negative 1669 pI have five pages in my application created in ASP.Net MVC 4.0 using .aspx engine. I have to use Kendo Grid in all the five pages. But I want to avoid duplicating the Kendo Grid code in five pages. Because in future there may be 1015 pages or more will be added. So that time instead of duplicating the code, needs to create a generic Kendo Grid template. ie, I should create only one partial class, but the below details will be changing for five different pages.p  ol liGeneric Grid should be able to bind to different models. ie, Model change in all five pages  Ex ProductModel, SalesModel, InvoiceModel etc li liNumber of columns will differ for each model  Ex ProductModel 5 columns, SalesModel 4 Columns, InvoiceModel 3 Columnsli liIn each page, Some of the columns are sortable and some are not sortable. I should be able to specify.li liWhen Click on Edit and Delete buttons I should populate different dialog boxes based on page and I should pass different parameters  Ex When Click on Edit button of ProductModel, ProductCode should pass as parameter and that Edit product dialog should display, similarly for other pagesli liIn each page, when user click on paging and sorting buttons there are search parameters which should be maintained and pass those parameters  Ex Search parameters will also vary for each page. In Read function of Grid I should be able to pass different number and type of parameters for different pages.li liThe edit and delete function names will be different for different pages.

Negative 1669 pI have been experimenting with log4j2.xml for some time and have been really impressed with the performance. However, I am stuck with an issue in which I need help. I am using rolling file appender to roll out log files everyday. I will share my log4j2.xml in a moment.

But if I dont send any requests to the Logging Application for the next 2 days, for example December 24 and December 25 and then send the request on December 27.

Negative 1669 pI have a problem with my animation. The idea is to move some imageviews to another imageviews positions using TranslateAnimation as you can see herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnIxKU.png altTranslateAnimationp  pthe animation works fine, the problem comes when I want to continue executing the code just after animation ends its is supposed to be executed after that. Im trying to ensure this using handler or onAnimationEnd but cant syncronize it fine.p  pEither the code takes place during the animation or its executed after the animation. p  pDuring the animation Its a matter of milliseconds but enough noticeable that the ImageView its shown one position ahead, after that little time ends it returns to the desired position, this happens because Im changing the ImageView in the way its shown in the Animation using setImageResource but if that change happens before the animation ends then well see the ImageView one position ahead as I said before and you can see in the following picturep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWsEzA.png altenter image description herep  pAfter the animation Well, the animation ends and some milliseconds after that the code its executed, during that time the ImageView returns to the initial position, after that little time it goes to the desired position, here applies the same explanation from above because Im using the same code, the difference is that the code its executed after the animationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXWAxa.png altenter image description herep  pIn Handler I was using the same waiting time as the Animation duration and I had this problem same with onAnimationEnd. So I tried different times in the Handler and the closest time to not notice this was the animation duration  25 milliseconds at least in my phone but it fails sometimes and idk how it will work on different devices, surely that depends on chips processing, so its not a solution.p  pHere its a little part of the code using Handlerp  precodeAnimationsConfig Configuring translate animations anim.setDuration500 anim2.setDuration500 anim3.setDuration500 anim4.setDuration500 anim5.setDuration500 anim6.setDuration500 animation.startAnimationanim animation2.startAnimationanim2 animation3.startAnimationanim3 animation4.startAnimationanim4 animation5.startAnimationanim5 animation6.startAnimationanim6 new Handler.postDelayednew Runnable      public void run          DrawNewPositions Changing imageviews resources according to the animation      , 500L codepre  pAlternatively used codeAnimation.setFillAftertruecode but with codeDrawNewPositionscode in the code leaves the ImageView one position ahead forever, not just millisecons then its worse, if I remove codeDrawNewPositionscode the codeImageViewcode will start from it first position forever.p  pI need a solution to solve this, those changes cant be noticeable in the user eyes and have to be enough smooth.p  pThanksp

Negative 1669 pall, p  pI have two branches, one is master, one is client and we have made a lot of changes in the client branch. Now we know all changes in client branch we made before 112015 are good and need to be merged into master. How do I do that Of course we also made a lot changes after 112015 in client. p  pWhat I did in Xcode 6.1 is switch to branch Client, then click Source Control  Client  Merge Into Branch  Master, however looks like that is going to merge everything from client to master, not just the ones before 112015. p  pAnother option might be, revert my code to the last change set status before 112015 in Client, then merge it back to master Will that work, if it does, how do I do thatp  pThanks.p

Negative 1669 pI have two types of data at hand.p  precodeHierarchicalDataSource [text Directory1, items [text File2, text Directory3, items [...]] ReportSections [title Directory1, pages [title File2, controls [...], title Directory3, pages [...]]  codepre  pAs you can probably see, the two objects are basically identical, except that ReportSections has controls in it while HierarchicalDataSource does not. To make it easier for you to understand why they are coded like these, I could like to take the URL as an analogy. The data above are similar to the followingp  blockquote   pDirectory1File2 Directory1 is a directory while Node2 is a file, and file has content in it, namely controls.p      pDirectory1Directory3... In this case, Directory3 is also a directory, so it does not have controls.p blockquote  pHere comes the problem. I would like to do a twoway conversion between them. Converting ReportSections to HierarchicalDataSource is obviously much easier in that I only need to change the property name and delete controls, while converting in turn seems to be much more difficult, because the relationship among nodes are quite flexible.p  pFor example, if HierachicalDataSource changes to the followingp  precode[text Directory3, items [], text Directory1, items [text File2]] codepre  pafter conversion according to the previous ReportSections, the new ReportSections should bep  precode[title Directory3, pages [], title Directory1, pages [title File2, controls [...]]]  controls remains the same like the metadata of File2. The move operation does not modify its metadata. codepre  pShould I try to flat the ReportSections first and then correspond each node in HierarchicalDataSource with the one which has the same title or text in the flat copy of ReportSections p  pI hope I have explained it well. Since Im quite at a loss, please provide me with a detailed solution with excerpts of necessary code. Thanks in advance p

Negative 1669 pI am trying to access the filename or MetaData I have added to my music over the years.

But have a Fairly decent, though not advanced understanding of that. p  pNow, Ideally Id like to check the original metadata if possible, and then check the filename. and pull out anything in  and save it to a Several Variables in the file as they are there ExtraInfo1, ExtraInfo2, etc. then check each against the title to make sure its not already in the title as sometimes the titles themselves have parentheses in their titles. then if not, be able to add them back to the title. to tag and rename them.p  pI did find this plugin, which pulls information out of the title and moves it to the version tag. So that is almost exactly what im looking for, except instead of taking it from the Title tag, id like to take it from the original title tag, or the filename. then add it to the new Title tag.p  pCould someone maybe help me with thisp  pheres the plugin I foundp  precodePLUGINNAME  Move metadata to version tag PLUGINAUTHOR  Jacob Rask PLUGINDESCRIPTION  Moves song metadata such as demo, live from title and titlesort to version tag.

Negative 1669 pI need to create an accounting algorithm in PHP that computes the following.p  pI am developing an application for members contributing a fixed amount of money on daily basis. Lets say the daily contributing amount is 200, and members can prepay for given numbers of days.p  pFor instance, if start date of contribution is 2015 April1 and a member pays 600, the algorithm should distribute the amount from 2015 April1 to 2015 April3.p  pIf he pays the next contribution on 2015 April10 and pays 2000 the algorithm should first pay the deficit from date 2015 April4 to 2015 April10 amounting to 1400 then distribute the balance as from 2015 April11 to 2015 April13 amounting to 600.p  pI was trying with the following code, which attempts to add logic to detect when user have overpaid and if overpaid, the algorithm to distribute the amount evenly as described above.

Negative 1669 pFor a game project Im building something that has some challenges in scalability that seem reverse from how you would normally scale a webapp. In short I have a webserver that receives requests, which are naturally executed in parallel by the threadpool for the appserver Jetty. So far the easy part.p  pFor each request the server needs to call a large e.g. 500  1000 number of participants running their own simple webapps concurrently, gather their moves and combine them to a result to answer the initial incoming request. The participants are simple webapps written by untrusted programmers participating in the game. They may be too slow or unreachable or actively try to break things by responding slowly.p  pAppservers are generally designed to handle the incoming requests cleanly using a ThreadPool. But how would you go about the outgoing requests part I thought about launching Threads or use a ThreadPool to make the callout to each of the participants, then in those threads use HttpClient from Apache httpcomponents to set strict timeouts e.g. must respond within 500ms and have the main request thread wait for all of them to finish. Possibly using a ConnectionManager and keepalive to ensure the threads return as fast as possible if the participant isnt stalling which most probably wont be doingp  pBut for just 20 concurrent incoming requests and 500 participants that would launch 10000 threads or block on the ThreadPool if it is smaller than that which is not a good idea.p  pI have been unable to find common solutions, most things I find are written around scaling the serverside of things looked at Apache Mina for example while in this case Im basically acting as a very high volume latency sensitive client.p  pSo are there common approaches to this Maybe open source programs that do something similar that I could analyze Libraries using NIO for handling large amounts of outgoing requests Or libraries that are designed around thisp

The important part is forward, back, left, and right conditions.

Negative 1669 pHello so basically the problem is that I have a slider that has a value from 01000 and if its between these values then display contracts that match them but I also have a checkbox underneath that when it is checked value changes to 10000 basically display all contracts and then obviously it needs to ignore value from a slider however I cannot make them work together, I am pretty sure that there needs to be else statement added to my if statement in codefunction checkMinutescode but it gives me an error whenever I try to put them together so now either I disable code for slider and checkbox works or other way round...

Negative 1669 pIm processing a large amount of documents using Stanfords CoreNLP library alongside the a hrefhttpsgithub.combrendanostanfordcorenlppywrapper relnofollowStanford CoreNLP Python Wrappera.

Im mainly using CoreNLP for its coreference resolution  named entity recognition, and as far as Im aware Im using the minimal set of annotators for this purpose.p  pstrongWhat methods can I take to speed up the annotation of documentsstrongp  pThe other SO answers all suggest not loading the models for every document, but Im already doing that since the wrapper starts the server once and then passes documentsresults back and forth.p  pThe documents I am processing have an average length of 20 sentences, with some as long as 400 sentences and some as short as 1.

Negative 1669 pI have a poco class which is wired up to the entity framework. The class is called PersonalizationCatalogPrice.  This class has a sub object called Pricelevel which does not have the virtual keyword on it. Because of this based on my understanding this object should never lazy load and should return null. However, we have found that this object seems to load up when used in a specific manner.p  pso the basic class structure is thisp  precodepublic class PersonalizationCatalogPrice              public int PersonalizationCatalogPriceID  get set           public int PersonalizationCatalogId  get set           public virtual PersonalizationCatalog PersonalizationCatalog  get set           public decimal CustomerRetail  get set           public decimal ConsultantCost  get set           public decimal PersonalVolume  get set           public decimal QualifyingVolume  get set           public int PriceLevelId  get set           public PriceLevel PriceLevel  get set   codepre  pHere is an example. In the first line we return an Iqueryable of PersonalizationCatalogPrice items.  In the second line we have another IQueryable and we are using the priclevel object in this iQueryable see the line contains pcp.pricelevel. When we do this, the pricelevel object loads up even though it has no virtual keyword. p  precodeIQueryableltPersonalizationCatalogPricegt allPersPriceRecords  e2ReposMan.PersonalizationRepository.GetSomeRecords  ListltPersonalizationCatalogPricegt persprices  allPersPriceRecords.ToList  var persQuery  from pl in personalizationLines                 join pcp in allPersPriceRecords on pl.Item2.PersonalizationCatalogPriceID equals pcp.PersonalizationCatalogPriceID                 where HostessPriceLevelTypes.Containspcp.PriceLevel.PriceLevelTypeId                 select pl.Item2.PersonalVolume  pl.Item1  var openOrdersTotal  query.Any  query.Sum  0  persQuery.Any  persQuery.Sum  0 codepre  pModifying this code by uncommenting the second line which performs a ToList however. Makes the pricelevel subobject return null as expectedd since it does not have a virtual keyword on it and the entity framework then works as we anticipate.  EF 6 p  pDoes anyone know why we are able to load the pricelevel property when we do not do the toList.  p  pthanks for any assistance.p

Negative 1669 pIm trying to use some of the PowerShell Azure commands in C.

Negative 1669 pIm trying to build out a basic database schema using Express and Sequelize. I define all of the models in separate files.

Each time the codemodelsindex.jscode file is required, a new instance of the Sequelize class is created, which establishes a new connection to the database. Im under the impression that multiple connections to the database are not desirable. Does anybody have any suggestions to avoid multiple instances of the Sequelize class Is it even a big problem to have multiple instancesp  pThanks in advancep

This is a users post, it has a like button at the bottom right a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comN39xG.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comN39xG.png altenter image description hereap  pAnd this is when I click on the post, it will have the modal pop up show more detail about the post just like when you click on an image in facebook.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comKOuHy.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKOuHy.jpg altenter image description hereap  pThen problem is when I click thumb up in the modal pop up it does not sync with the thumb up in the original one a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comD36O8.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comD36O8.jpg altenter image description hereap  pThis is the vote codep  precodeVoteButtons.link  function scope, ele, att  var postid  att.voteButtons scope.upvoteclass  default scope.downvoteclass  default scope.upvotesnumber  0 scope.downvotesnumber  0 scope.postid  postid var upvotesid  [] var downvotesid  [] if postid    http.getapipostsgetvotes  postid.successfunction res      if res ampamp res.error        upvotesid  res.response.upvotes       downvotesid  res.response.downvotes       if upvotesid          scope.upvotesnumber  upvotesid.length               if downvotesid          scope.downvotesnumber  downvotesid.length               if rootScope.user ampamp upvotesid ampamp upvotesid.indexOfrootScope.user.id  1          scope.upvoteclass  success               if rootScope.user ampamp downvotesid ampamp downvotesid.indexOfrootScope.user.id  1          scope.downvoteclass  danger                    scope.thumbup  function       http.postapipostsupvote  postid.successfunction res        if res ampamp res.error          upvotesid  res.response.upvotes         downvotesid  res.response.downvotes         if upvotesid            scope.upvotesnumber  upvotesid.length                   if downvotesid            scope.downvotesnumber  downvotesid.length                   if rootScope.user ampamp upvotesid ampamp upvotesid.indexOfrootScope.user.id  1            scope.upvoteclass  success           Socket.emitthumbup,res.response          else            scope.upvoteclass  default                   if rootScope.user ampamp downvotesid ampamp downvotesid.indexOfrootScope.user.id  1            scope.downvoteclass  danger          else            scope.downvoteclass  default                  else          rootScope.alerts  res.error.message                   scope.thumbdown  function       http.postapipostsdownvote  postid.successfunction res        if res ampamp res.error          upvotesid  res.response.upvotes         downvotesid  res.response.downvotes         if upvotesid            scope.upvotesnumber  upvotesid.length                   if downvotesid            scope.downvotesnumber  downvotesid.length                   if rootScope.user ampamp upvotesid ampamp upvotesid.indexOfrootScope.user.id  1            scope.upvoteclass  success          else            scope.upvoteclass  default                   if rootScope.user ampamp downvotesid ampamp downvotesid.indexOfrootScope.user.id  1            scope.downvoteclass  danger          else            scope.downvoteclass  default                 else          rootScope.alerts  res.error.message                  codepre
Negative 1669 pI have dual boot PC, Debian 8 64bit and Windows 10 64bit. Ive typed two codes in C implementing BST tree with DSW algorithm and deap heap. In both codes there is function adding 100000 nodes of data structures using new operator. On Windows the codes are compiled using latest TDM GCC compiler Dev C and they runtimes arent longer than 1 sec, but on Linux theyre compiled using default GCC compiler and they runtimes are longer than 20 sec. Why the difference is so huge It is fault of the compilator or the OS Ive noticed that adding functions are so slow. Ive read that new operator is thread safe on Linux which may be slowing it so much, but I dont know it is actually this reason. On another PC with Win7 runtimes were also shorter than 1 sec. I believe Linux programs should run faster than Windows ones. So whats wrong It is possible to speed up runtime on Linuxp  pMy BSTDSW code a hrefhttpsideone.comtFvxbt relnofollowhttpsideone.comtFvxbtap  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include lttime.hgt include

Negative 1669 pon one of my servers iam getting a java error. That error creates a lot of .log and .mdmp files which fill up the server.

Negative 1669 pIm having problems creating and executing tests using TFS Test Manager and Im hoping someone can help me sort them out.p  pI can create a Test Plan and associate it to an Iteration, and the add a new Test Case through the Test Plan associated to the same iteration.  Ive also tried creating a further test case through Parameters and associated it to the same iteration but not the Test Plan. Both the Test Plan Statuses have been set as ready.  When I go back to the Test Plan, I have two problems as far as I can seep  ol lipThe Test Cases created do not list under the Test Plan in the the left hand panel.pli lipIn the right hand panel, the menu bar with the buttons to execute tests displays for about half a second and is then replaced with an error message saying No default test configuration is found.  I suspect this is because of 1 above, but cant be sure.pli ol  pIm clearly configuring something incorrectly but cannot see what.   Is anybody able to help me  Ill be greatly indebted to you if you can.p
Negative 1669 pI have two different models whose QuerySets I want to combine together. I have seen that I can use itertools.chain to concatenate them together whilst retaining their iteratornessp  pAssuming both sets are ordered the same, I want an iterator that you can give both QuerySets and the fields by which they are ordered and then it will interleave the two or more sets, retaining the order that they both share. The QuerySets could both be very large so I dont want to process them as lists. Anyone know of anythingp  pBack in the pre DBMS day when I was a mainframe Cobol programmer, this kind of thing was my bread and butter.p
Negative 1669 pThe problem Im having here is not being able to find the right question to ask. Id like to use a single partial and populate it with different data based on a url. The url would look something like thisp  precodelocalhost8080usersUSERID codepre  pWhere codeuserscode directs to a user profile partial, and corresponding controller, and codeUSERIDcode would be sent in to an HTTP request to retrieve user data that would then populate the user profile partial.p  pAny direction in solving this is greatly appreciated.p
Negative 1669 pI have a website under version control using GIT. I have a system set up that essentially, automatically deploys changes in my codemastercode branch to my production server. Namely, I have a webhook in my repository that triggers a PHP script that essentially initiates a codegit pullcode on the server in order to pull down changes.p  pMy issue lies in the fact that I currently have a configuration file codeconfig.phpcode that is tracked using git. Myself and another developer want to have our own codeconfig.phpcode files that are different to the file on the server, therefore we want to tell git to stop tracking this file and just pretend it isnt there.p  pWe decided first to test using a less important file, so we added codetest.phpcode to our code.gitignorecode file, hoping this would do the trick. Git was still tracking the file so I tried running codegit rm cached test.phpcode in an attempt to stop tracking the file. This seemed to work so we committed and pushed our changes.p  pTo my surprise, when our deployment script initiated the pull on our server we found that this file had been deleted from production. Thanksfully, the deleted codetest.phpcode was not important.p  pstrongTLDRstrong How can I tell git to ignore a file it currently tracks, have it untracked and deleted from my repository, but leave it intact on my production serverp

Negative 1669 pWe are developing a system running on Wildfly 9. The system consists of several packages that fulfill different roles. To make it simple, lets say we have strongcollectorstrong, strongproviderstrong, and strongmanagementstrong packages  EARs in fact it is a little bit more complicated, but it does not matter.p  pNow, we have defined its own servergroup for each kind of package. This way they are separated into own processes. There are three nodes in the cluster and on each of them all server groups are present. It means there are 9 virtual servers in the infrastructure and they all can form the cluster and communicate together.p  pThey are in the same channel, in the same stack  TCP. We have another stack for HornetQ. It means that if there anything happens to e.g. JGroups, all the virtual serverspackages are influenced.p  pThe question is whether it is a good practice to separate the individual server groups into separate channelsstacks. Of course, it would mean that it will not be possible to form a cluster across the groups, but it is no issue for us. But would it increase the stability of the whole solution Do you have any experience with it Thank you for any help.p
Negative 1669 pI used to render all my html in php and then echo an html string when complete. When a php error occurred in my test site this is an error during development, like a misspelled variable I would echo the error and quit. Very easy to then see the error and quickly fix it. When the site is live I would show a generic error and send the error specifics via email. These live errors are less common and an email is perfect.p  pCurrently I am moving to rendering the page using javascriptjquery. Now when PHP error occurs the error does not render on the page. I can get the error via email, but sometimes I am even unaware that an error has occurred. There is no error in the console, and the page, with exception of the header and footer, will be blank.p  pConsequently, In order to then show php errors I do all my php code first. Errors will show as expected. In php I echo the header and footer html. The javascript code then operates on the content div. Any php errors after this point go unseen or are hard to find. I am able to send an email of the error which is now my method of debugging  seems incorrect.p  pHere is my current error handlerp  precodemessage  ltpgtNice Job moron A pos error occurred in script efile on line eline emessagenltbr gt  Add the date and time message .

Everything is in sync and we are happy.p  pHowever, if Developer B rejects Developer A changes, then my local and remote repos are now not in sync with the upstream, Git wont allow me to push any changes.

Negative 1669 pOur application has been working in offline mode for a long period of time. During latest version it stopped. We identified that it is connected with the size of the application due the size of all new controllers and the way Sencha copy the files to the local store for the upgrade process. Copying all files to the local store is exhausting the space so at the end some files are not copied there but the device  has a copy locally based on the manifest. We are not using the mechanism of delta upgrade, we always update the application entirely. p  pIs there anyway we can bypass this process of copying files to the local store or do not verify against the local store and trust entirely in the manifest mechanism using the standards of HTML 5p
