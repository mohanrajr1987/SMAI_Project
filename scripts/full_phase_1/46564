If I click any other buttons that open the browser and then return to app, the back button works fine. It even works fine after I return to app after clicking the AdMob interstitial ad So only AdMob banner breaks the back button.p  pI have tried to add back button listener again on Event.ACTIVATE when user returns to app, but it didnt help.p  pWhat is happening and how can i prevent this I wrote the admob native extension myself, so i can try to fix this issue both in as3 or android java.

Positive 46564 pI am currently adding admob banner to my IOS app. I have already used aduinitID for my bannerView. But I havent distributed the app yet .When I was testing on real device and simulator, without any doubt, Admob didnt count my request for these banner. p  pBut How can I make sure that when I release the app they would count it for me .  How will admob detect when my app gets online . Or is there any step that I have to do in advance, or when my app is confirmed that it was approved by apple to notify admob that my app is on storep  pBy the way, how much money in dollars do I get when displaying banner and Interstitial when using admob And how much when user touch on the banner .p  pIn addition, can I create several bannerViews but just only lay them on the same position on my Viewcontroller The point is to increase request in the case displaying banner to make profit.p

Obviously if anyone knows how to contact them I just found the appeal form would be even better. p  pThanksp

Positive 46564 pI have over 10,000 downloads of my android app. I have google admob setup. For the iPhone version, it is working fine. We are generating revenue. For the android version, no revenue is being generated at all. People arent seeing the ads.p  pAlso, we have complaints that many people cant login to the android app. We use an API to our separate server to login people, we dont use the meteor accounts system.p  pOur HTTP calls to the remote server dont seem to be working. Also, admob isnt displaying the ads.

Positive 46564 pThis is not a programming but the best practice question. I have been looking for answer on internet but no success so far. p  pQuestion is very simple.  Do you guys keep only one banner per app or one banner per view.  I have app which is 4 tabs and having 2 navigation drill down. Its pretty basic app and things are already out of in my admob dashboard.  So I am here. seeking advice from people who have multiple apps on appstore.  How you manage  If I am keeping only one admob signature per app. would it affect my impression.  I am thinking to have one banner and one interstitial per app.  Dont know if that right thing to do.  Please suggestion. p  pPS I know its not programming question, but its not useless question. I am sure there are people like me out there. p

Negative 46564 pI have a web project that I developed where one of the main functions is uploading files.p  pAll the permissions are based on Windows Authentication. When I first created the project, I didnt realize that it would be on a load balanced server.  Now its in the environment with the load balanced server and the file upload has become a major issue.p  pI originally thought that I could just create a virtual directory to a network share that would be the upload folder, however that solution has turned into a permissions nightmare.  I havent been able to do any successful test runs in the production environment.p  pSo Im thinking now, my solutions would be to create a service on the servers that checks the upload directory and syncs them up.  The other possible solution I see is to store the files in the database which Ive had some issues with in the past.p  pDoes anyone know of a straight forward solution for uploading files to a load balanced server that authenticates using Windows Permissionsp  pThanks.p  pUPDATE  So I have changed the application pools to run through a domain account that has full permissions on the share and the folder itself in the Windows permissions.  The Virtual directory has full privileges in IIS, but Im still getting the same issue.p  pOne of the things that needs to be done with this is also the ability to create directories, which I think might be tripping me up now.  Im just using System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectoryp  pAny other thoughts on where I could be missing permissionsp
Negative 46564 pIm looking for an algorithm that sorts strings similar to the way files and folders are sorted in Windows Explorer.

Negative 46564 pHow do I specify Vim settings for all files under the current directoryp  pThe ideal solution would be if Vim searched for and read a .vimrc in the current directory before searching for .vimrc, and apply the settings there for the entire tree.p  pIve seen a a hrefhttpwww.vim.orgscriptsscript.phpscriptid1860plugina, but this means the applied settings arent transparent since they require the plugin to be installed.  In contrast, a modeline is transparent since regardless of a users vimrc or specific vim invocation the modeline settings will be applied for that file.p  pThings I tried arep  ul liplacing a .vimrc in the working directoryli licodeso vimrccode in the modeline.li ul  pI suppose both dont work for security reasons.

Negative 46564 pWe are loading some xaml for an Element at runtime XamlReader.Load for some preview purposes. Need less to say, the propertiesbindings are not know as they can vary across elementscontrols we are loading. p  pAs the run time view model context is not available when we load the control for preview  after loading the Element, the idea is to grab the binding information, create a type with those propertes at run time, to assign the same as the data context of the loaded control. p  pWell be using AssemblyBuilderModuleBuilderTypeBuilder to build a type at run time.

Negative 46564 pIm still pretty new to using Android, but I decided that my first application would be a simple flashlight app for my new Incredible. Unfortunately, it seems to be more difficult than I had originally thought.p  pIt seems that theres no way to access the LEDs through the SDK, at least not without a bunch of weird hacks to make the phone pretend that its taking a picture. Even then, I can only get the LEDs to turn on. They only turn off if the phone is put on hold, and doing so breaks all camerarelated apps until the phone is rebooted.p  pSo, I was wondering if accessing the LEDs through the NDK was possible, or if there was any other camerarelated APIs that would seem to do what I want.p  pIve looked at other code for other flashlights, so it looks like its a hardwarebased problem. I figured Id give up because it doesnt appear to be possible, but I thought I should ask here first on the offchance somebody knows something that I dont.p

Negative 46564 pI am experimenting with ZendNavigation to build breadcrumb for a web site. I created an XML file which lists the hierarchy of pages. Things are working fine for the most part except for pages that have dynamic parameters.p  pFor example, there is a group page which has the URL  www...groupsgid1001. The id 1001 is dynamic so it changes for different groups. Because of that I cannot put it in the XML file. In that case, ZF generates a link without including any parameters, which of course wont work.p  pOne solution I found is dynamically injecting the parameters to the ZendNavigation object. This is working fine except that I need to do it for each action or controller.p  pIs there a better way to handle it Does ZF have any classes to do this workp  pI will appreciate any feedback.p  pThanksp

Ive looked at a number of librariesp  pCbr freeopenbr a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectssharpssh relnofollowSharpSSHabr a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsgranados relnofollowGranadosap  pcommercialbr a hrefhttpwww.rebex.netsftp.net relnofollowRebexap  pCbr a hrefhttpcurl.haxx.selibcurlc relnofollowlibcurlOpenSSHap  pAll of these appear to require the private key to be stored on the filesystem, which I would prefer to avoid for security reasons. I would also prefer not to implement the authentication myself although I recognize that as an option. My questionsp  pIs there a way to feed any of these libraries or any libraryAPI I may have overlooked the key values directly from memory instead of loading from a filep  pIf not, what is the recommended way to manage these key files Beyond password encryption and tight access control, are there other things one should do to protect the key filep
Negative 46564 pI have an ASP.NET web application and at a certain point I do thisp  precodemycontrol.stringparameterforjscript  document.getElementById  myotherparam  .value  Hello codepre  pThe problem is that this thing does not work. As you can see this sets a javascript in some event of some tag. Well when the page is redered the problem is that my parameter look like thisp  precodelttextarea onfocusdocument.getElementByIdamp39myvalueamp39.value  amp39Helloamp39gtlttextareagt codepre  pI must precise that this textbox Im trying to set is located inside a InsertItemTemplate of a ListView and it is not so easy to intialize. For this reason I inserted my initialization code that you see inside the load event handler of my textbox. I can say you one thing If this code referred to a text box located freely in the page and I called this piece of code from the load event handler of the page, this would work well. But I do not know how to do in this particular case.p  pIm also considering the possibility to create a webcntrol to handle such a problem. I dont really know whats the best practice in this case.p

Negative 46564 pSo, Ive got a little translation system set up for my app, where we generate a list of all strings that are marked as translatable, dump that in a CSV as the translation template, and then a translator fills out the next column with the translations.p  pThe problem Im trying to solve is how to extract a bunch of marked strings from a codebase, to automate the translation template generation.p  pAn example line of c code looks something likep  precodetextBoxName.Text  string.FormatTranslate.trCreate 0, NextAutoName codepre  pAnd c would look likep  precodeinfoout ltlt tr LGrip weights range from 0 to 1 lowweighthighweight ltlt endl codepre  pOn the c side, building the list of strings for the template generation uses a c parser see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1369292my previous questiona, which runs as part of the external builds over all c code in the project.  Basically, any string thats placed in a tr call is automatically extracted.p  pIs there a better solution with c than writing another parser  I would love a list of strings that gets produced at compile time, or one that I can access at runtime.  A codeListltstringgtcode would be great.p  pId like to keep the same translation file format, because that makes coordinating the two sides much simpler.  As youd expect, we reuse a lot of strings.  p  pRight now its much more convenient in c to keep the translation template up to date  I just need to make sure that the strings I want translated are wrapped in tr, and the parser handles the rest.  In c, I currently manually inspect all strings, and update a dummy function on the c side with new strings.  Im getting close to breaking down and just writing another parser.  I was hoping that c, with its highlevel features, might be able to do a better job here.p

Negative 46564 pI am working with an existing Web system using JSF and we are upgrading to JSF 2.0. Now we use tsaveState supplied by Tomohawk library to persist beans between requests. But, unfortunately, it is the only usage of the library so we have decided to get rid of it.       There are quite a few alternatives I have stumbled across. Custom scopes is one of them. But I have been searching the internet and it doesnt strike me as a good choice since it has been recently released and documented quite mediocre. Now I tend to use a SessionMap to store parameters. But, for example, as soon as bean goes out of certain pages I want values bound not to bereferenced any longer. Adjusted view scope, so to speak. And I would like it to use JSF 2.0 abilities at full. Elegance is also not a last thing on my mind Could you share some thoughts with me how to do that Thank you so much in advance.

Negative 46564 pWe have a problem which is embarrassingly parallel  we run a large number of instances of a single program with a different data set for each we do this simply by submitting the application many times to the batch queue with different parameters each time.p  pHowever with a large number of jobs, not all of them complete. It does not appear to be a problem in the queue  all of the jobs are started.p  pThe issue appears to be that with a large number of instances of the application running, lots of jobs finish at roughly the same time and thus all try to write out their data to the parallel filesystem at pretty much the same time. p  pThe issue then seems to be that either the program is unable to write to the filesystem and crashes in some manner, or just sits there waiting to write and the batch queue system kills the job after its been sat waiting too long. From what I have gathered on the problem, most of the jobs that fail to complete, if not all, do not leave core filesp  pWhat is the best way to schedule diskwrites to avoid this problem I mention our program is embarrassingly parallel to highlight the fact the each process is not aware of the others  they cannot talk to each other to schedule their writes in some manner.p  pAlthough I have the sourcecode for the program, wed like to solve the problem without having to modify this if possible as we dont maintain or develop it plus most of the comments are in Italian.p  pI have had some thoughts on the matterp  ol liEach job write to the local scratch disk of the node at first. We can then run another job which checks every now and then what jobs have completed and moves the files from the local disks to the parallel filesystem.li liUse an MPI wrapper around the program in masterslave system, where the master manages a queue of jobs and farms these off to each slave and the slave wrapper runs the applications and catches the exception could I do this reliably for a filesystem timeout in C, or possibly Java, and sends a message back to the master to rerun the jobli ol  pIn the meantime I need to pester my supervisors for more information on the error itself  Ive never run into it personally, but I havent had to use the program for a very large number of datasets yet.p  pIn case its useful we run Solaris on our HPC system with the SGE Sun GridEngine batch queue system. The filesystem is NFS4, and the storage servers also run Solaris. The HPC nodes and storage servers communicate over fibre channel links.p

Negative 46564 pbr I would like to know how to run Pig queries stored in Hive format. I have configured Hive to store compressed data using this tutorial a hrefhttpwiki.apache.orghadoopHiveCompressedStoragehttpwiki.apache.orghadoopHiveCompressedStoragea.  p  pBefore that I used to just use normal Pig load function with Hives delimiter A. But now Hive stores data in sequence files with compression. Which load function to usep  pNote that dont need close integration like mentioned here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3801325usinghivewithpigUsing Hive with Piga, just what load function to use to read compressed sequence files generated by Hive.p  pThanks for all the answers.p
Negative 46564 pSo Im using Backbone.js, and in one of my main views Ive encountered a very strange bug that I cant for the life of me figure out how to solve.p  pThe view looks a look like the new Twitter layout. It receives an array of objects, each of which describes a collection and views elements that act on that collection. Each collection is represented by one tab in the view. The render method on my view takes this array of collection objects, clears out the tabContainer DOM element if it isnt already empty, renders the tabs and then binds events to each of those tabs. p  pNow in my code I have the method to render the tabs and the method to bind the click handlers to those tabs sequentially. This works fine the first time I execute render, but on subsequent calls of render, the click handlers are not bound. Heres the relevant code snippetp  precodeinitialize function     Context on render, addAllTabs and bindTabEvents is set correctly to this   .bindAllthis, render, openModel, closeModel, isOpen, addAllModels, switchTab,                   addOneModel, addTab, removeTab, addAllTabs, loadCollection,                    renderControls, setCurrentCollection, loadModels, bindTabEvents    this.template  JST[uiviewer]   this.el.htmlthis.template     The tabContainer is cached and always available   this.tabContainer            this.ul.tabs   this.collectionContainer     this.collectioncontainer   this.controlsContainer       this.controls   this.showMoreButton          this.showmorebutton ,  render functioncollections, dashboard     If bindTabEvents has been called before, then this.tab exists. I     intentionally destroy this.tabs and all previously bound click handlers.   if this.tabs this.tabContainer.html   if collections this.collections  collections   if dashboard this.dashboard.htmldashboard.render.el    addAllTabs redraws each of the tabs in my view from scratch using addTab   this.addAllTabs    All tabs are present in the DOM before my bindTabEvents function is called    However these events are only bound on the first render and not subsequent renders   this.bindTabEvents   var firsttab  this.collections[0].id   this.openTabfirsttab   return this ,  openTab function collectionId, e     If I move bindTabEvents to here, per my more thorough explanation below    my bug is somehow magically fixed. This makes no friggin sense.   if this.isTabOpencollectionId return false   this.switchTabcollectionId, e ,  addAllTabs function    .eachthis.collections, this.addTab  ,  bindTabEvents function    this.tabs  .reduce.pluckthis.collections, id, .bindfunction tabEvents, collectionId      var tabId  this.  collectionId  tab     tabEvents[collectionId]  tabId.click.bindthis.switchTab, this, collectionId     return tabEvents   , this,  ,  addTab functioncontent    this.tabContainer.append     ltligt       .attrid, content.id  tab       .addClasstab       .appendltspangt         .addClasslabel         .textcontent.name   this.loadCollectioncontent.id   this.bindtab  content.id, this.loadCollection   pg.account.bindchangelocation, this.loadCollection  TODO Should this be here ,  etc.. codepre  pAs I said, the render method here does work, but only the first time around. The strange part is that if I move the line codethis.bindTabEventscode and make it the first line of the openTab method like in the following snippet, then the whole thing works perfectlyp  precodeopenTab function collectionId, e    this.bindTabEvents   if this.isTabOpencollectionId return false   this.switchTabcollectionId, e , codepre  pOf course, that line of code has no business being in that method, but it does make the whole thing work fine, which leads me to ask why it works there, but doesnt work sequentially like sop  precodethis.addAllTabs this.bindTabEvents codepre  pThis makes no sense to me since, it also doesnt work if I put it after this linep  precodevar firsttab  this.collections[0].id codepre  peven though that is essentially the same as what does work insofar as execution order is concerned.p  pDoes anyone have any idea what Im doing wrong and what I should be doing to make this correct in terms of both behavior and coding stylep

Negative 46564 pIs it possible to show the report title of a selected report in the report pane before mandatory parameters are given Im using the codeMicrosoft.Reporting.WinForms.ReportViewercode to show reports. p  pThis is espesially useful when a user has used a drillthrough feature in a few subsequent reports, and it is no longer obvious which report you are viewing. The user would then get prompted for a set of parameters that could be similar to other reports, but as far as I can see, there is no way of displaying which report you are viewing until you have filled in the parameters and clicked View report.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIt would be just as useful for me to know that this is in fact not possible to do.

Negative 46564 pThis is more specifically with SQL Server Reporting Services, however I also see this as typical .Net application issue as well.p  pHere is the problem. We are using SSRS to report data from Oracle database. From day 1 our users are complaining that they get errors like ORA2396 Exceeded maximum idle time, ORA01012Not logged on etc.p  pWe have included DBAs, app developers, network engineer, but so far we could not find any better clue to that.p  pRecently while perform some research, I have observed that many people have documented one known issue with .Net connectivity to oracle. As they mention, if we are using connection pooling, there is a possibility that even unuseful connection might be available in the pool. On next request, this connection might get used and at that point the error will be thrown. As confirmed by our DBA, our oracle instance is set to kill the connection if its idle for X minutes.p  pHere are the links which has the aforesaid mention  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary8xx3tycavVS.90.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary8xx3tycavVS.90.aspxap  pa hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBdotnetADONETConnectionPooling.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comKBdotnetADONETConnectionPooling.aspxa  p  pThere are couple of more as well. However I do not get a very confirmed statement anywhere stating that yes, this is an issue with current latest versions of .Net and oracle etc.p  pOn solution part, they mention that we shall be using Validate Connectiontrue attribute as part of connection string. But if I try to use that, it says Key word not supported  validate connection.  I have also tried Validconp  pQuestions I have are these 1. Is it confirmed that this dirty read from connection pool problem exists 2. If so, what are the solutions 3. If not, what could be causing the issues at our end.p  pIf you need more information, feel free to comment.p

Negative 46564 pI have a Single Page Application in which the browser does all the logic work.  Except for initial loading, the server is pretty much a fancy interface to the database.p  pThe browser sends data dictionary keys, column name  value pairs, and where clauses for SELECT, for example.  The server assembles the parts into SQL, executes the queries, and replies.  NEW In a SELECT, for example, the table name and columns pulled are from the data dictionary  the browser supplies the data dictionary key and the SELECT where clause.p  pThis very open environment is very susceptible to SQL Injection attacks.

This will prevent SQL Injection Attacks from changing the database.p  pSecond, write a wrapper function for codemysqlicode that will allow NULL and MySQL functions to be passed as parameters.  This will allow parameters to be easily used for all DML.p  pThird, shadow highly sensitive data where it cannot be seen or touched by normal queries or normal users.  This will put sensitive data, such as passwords, out of the range of attacks.p  pForth, write a wrapper order to enforce the user  query type relationship.  This will ensure SELECT are executed by the codeselectcode user, for examplep  pThe result of that effort is a hrefhttpsgithub.combangkokmacoMySQLsqlinjectionprevention relnofollowherea.

Negative 46564 pWell, I got an assignment [miniproject] in which one of the most important issues is the database consistency. The project is a web application, which allows multiple users to access and work with it. I can expect concurrent querying and updating requests into a small set of tables, some of them connected one to the other using FOREIGN KEYS.p  pIn order to keep the database as consistent as possible, we were advised to use isolation levels. After reading a bit maybe not enough about them, I figured the most useful ones for me are READ COMMITTED and SERIALIZABLE.p  pI can divide the queries into three kinds  p  ol liFetching queryli liUpdating queryli liComboli ol  pFor the first one, I need the data to be consistent of course, I dont want to present dirty data, or uncommitted data, etc. Therefore, I thought to use READ COMMITTED for these queries. For the updating query, I thought using SERIALIZABLE will be the best option, but after reading a bit, i found myself lost. In the combo, Ill probably have to read from the DB, and decide whether I needcan update or not, these 23 calls will be under the same transaction.p  pWanted to ask for some advice in which isolation level to use in each of these query options. Should I even consider different isolation levels for each type or just stick to onep  pIm using MySQL 5.1.53, along with MySQL JDBC 3.1.14 driver Requirements... Didnt choose the JDBC versionp  pYour insights are much appreciated p  pEditp  pIve decided Ill be using bREPEATABLE READb which seems like the default level. Im not sure if its the right way to do, but I guess bREPEATABLE READb along with bLOCK IN SHARE MODEb and bFOR UPDATEb to the queries should work fine...p  pWhat do you guys thinkp

Negative 46564 pI have noticed that some browsers via a build in development feature allow you to choose different user agents.p  pDoes this mean that they change their rendering enginep  pSay for example, if I set Safaris user agent to internet explorer  will that then change the rending engine from webkit to tridentp  pAt the moment on my mac I have Safari, Chrome, Firefox and iCab installed. I would imagine they would represent the different engines better than the user agent function built in. However you are only limited to installing 1 version of each unless you go the virtual machine or dual boot way.p  pSo what is your advice Run multiple virtual machine and of course the extra licenses to do it legal will need to be purchased. or stick with the user agent function built in and that gives a good enough interperatation of the differencesp  pCheers Jeffp

I tried using a codeBackgroundworkercode and codeThreadpoolcode but they create too many requests at same, which make them useless to me. Any suggestion, how one could solve this problem Create my own codeThreadpoolcode with exactly 5 threads Any suggestions, how to implement thisp  pMany Thanks.p  pJasperp

Negative 46564 pWhile trying to answer this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8064798calltoanas2functionfromtheas3containerCall to an AS2 function from the AS3 containera I have come across a roadblock.  The setup is an AS3 SWF which loads an AS2 SWF, which in turn loads another AS2 SWF. Communication between the AS3 SWF and the parent AS2 SWF is achieved through localConnection.p  pstrongchildas2.swfstrong  This is a very simple timeline animation of a box moving across the screen with the following code on frame 1p  precodestop function playMovie      play  codepre  pstrongparentas2.swfstrong  This is the intermediary AS2 container which loads in childas2.swf.  The load is triggered by a LocalConnection callp  precodeimport mx.utils.Delegate  this.lockroot  true  var containerMovieClip  createEmptyMovieClipcontainer, 10 mustnt cast this or the Delegate breaks var mcLoader  new MovieClipLoader mcLoader.lockroot  true mcLoader.onLoadInit  Delegate.createthis,onMCLoadInit  function onMCLoadInit      traceload init     container.playMovie   LocalConnection code var myLCLocalConnection  new LocalConnection  myLC.loadChild  function     mcLoader.loadClipchildas2.swf, container     traceloading   myLC.connectAVM codepre  pstrongparentas3.swfstrong  This is the outer wrapper, written in AS3. It loads parentas2.swf, and communicates with it via LocalConnectionp  precodevar myLCLocalConnection  new LocalConnection  var loaderLoader  new Loader loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListenerEvent.INIT,onLoaded loader.loadnew URLRequestparentas2.swf addChildloader   function onLoadedeventEventvoid      setTimeout hack to circumvent 2000 Security context error     setTimeoutfunction          myLC.sendAVM, loadChild     ,1  codepre  pThe issue is that the codeonMCLoadInitcode function in parentas2 is never called when it is loaded inside the AS3 wrapper, although the load does take place. The events also fail when using a listener object in place of Delegate.  The box from childas2.swf is visible, but never starts moving.  However, if I run parentas2.swf on its own and start the load without the LocalConnection it works fine. It also wroks correctly when triggered from an external LocalConnection call.  Why does the AS3 wrapper prevent the MovieClipLoaders events from firingp  h2Updateh2  pSo accepting that no events can be fired from the MovieClipLoader in parentas2.swf, I have modified the code to detect the loadInit state by a combination of polling codeMovieClipLoader.getProgresscode and the existance of a function in childas2.swf.  Its not pretty but it seems to work.

Negative 46564 pI have some code Im converting from java to c for the sake of improving speed. Everything that Im looking at converting is matrix or vector based arithmetic and so I was wondering if when Im returning values back to Java if Im negating the benefit of all the native code by returning my values back in the form of primitive float arrays.  The way everything is written in java where I have to plug the values back into require that I extract everything out of an array coming back from jni and plug it back into the individual floats. This is no problem but when its all said and done will I be killing my gained performance by extracting values and storing them in individual floats. I could go through and change everything to use arrays but for ease of programming Id rather leaving all the existing code in place where possible. p  pSo I suppose I would like to know if you take a performance hit when you deal with extracting values from arrays coming back from JNI methods in c and if so what would be the extent of the hit.p

As I increased the number of objectsshapes the performance decreased and I made some tests to see if instead of drawing shapes drawing bitmaps is faster. And.. drawing bitmaps seems to be considerable faster less computation maybe BUT the movement is not smooth.

Negative 46564 pIm relatively new to silverstripe cms and Im trying to move a site to a new host. I followed all the instructions I could find on their official forums but to no avail.p  pHere is what I mean. Here you can see what the site should look likep  pa hrefhttpwww.efekto.co.za relnofollowhttpwww.efekto.co.zaap  pBut this is what it looks like after I have moved it copied everything to my publichtml folder on the new site, set up the db username and passwords etcp  pPlease help cause Im utterly and truly stuck at the moment.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWykUT.png altenter image description herep  pSince someone else initialy moved the site so I decided to delete everything and move everything myself. Its hard to explain otherwise what I have tried or not tried.p  pFirst I tried to install just a base silverstripe. Got that right pretty much but only after I specified the database ip as 127.0.0.1 and not the external ip. So I deleted the base install again, copied over all the site files again and this time modified the db params to use 127.0.0.1 Some of the pages now actually reflect valid content but it seems that everything is not this light blue kind of color seems to be a default of SS  It is as if its missing some kind of master page or something as I can see content, but no module thingies like menus, blog section etc.p  pI also have to mention that to test this I change my hosts file so that www.efecto.co.za resolves to the sites new ip address with our new host. So from my machine it resolves to new ip but from the servers perspective when it fetches things like css its obviously going to fecth it from where www.efekto.co.za is currently hosted. Hope that makes sensep  pSo 1 step in the right direction at least. We have content and no more errors. Now whats up with this blue color schemep

Negative 46564 pI have an application written in Python and compiled with PyInstaller. It also uses PyQt for the GUI framework.p  pRunning this application has a delay of about 10 seconds before the main window loads and is shown. As far as I can tell, this is not due to slowness in my code. Instead, I suspect this is due to the Python runtime initializing.p  pThe problem is that this application is started with a custom laucncher  taskbar application. The user will click the button to launch the app, see nothing appear to happen, and click elsewhere on another application. When my application shows its window, it cannot come to the foreground due to the rules for SetForegroundWindow.p  pI have access to the source for the PyInstaller win32 loader, the Python code, and even the launcher code.p  pMy questions arep  ul lipHow can I make this application start fasterpli lipHow can I measure the time spend i the first few seconds of the processs lifetimepli lipWhat is the generally accepted technique for reducing time until the first window is shownpli ul  pId like to avoid adding a splash screen for two reasons  one, I expect it wont help the overhead is before Python code runs and two, I just dont like splash screens p  pIf I need to, I could probably edit the PyInstaller loader stub to create a window, but thats another route id rather not take.p  pThanks for the suggestions.p

Negative 46564 pMy iPhone app uses core data and things are fine for most part. But here is a problem after a certain amount of data, it stalls at first time execution where core data entities must be loaded.p  pSome experimenting showed that things are OK up to a certain amount of data loaded in Core Data at start. If I go over a critical amount the installation starts failing. The bigger the amount of data for start, the higher the probability that it fails.p  pBy making separate tests I made sure the data themselves are not faulty. I also can say this problem does not appear in the simulator. It also does not happen when I connect the debugger to the device.p  pIt looks like too much data loaded in core data in a short amount of time creates some kind of overload. Is that true Any idea on a possible solutionp  pAt this point I made up a partial solution using a UIActionSheet object to kill some time asking the user to push a button. But this is not very satisfactory, though for the time being it works.p  pAny comment or advice for a better way would be appreciated.p

Negative 46564 pemstrongEDIT I figured it out, look towards the bottom half of thisemstrongp  pBefore I ask my question, I will state I have successfully used TBXML and RapidXML. Specifically Rapid has parsed this very same document successfully. Im familiar with XML reading and assigning values.p  pThat said, TinyXML and Cocos seems to be a good combination, as it compiles to android. I can go down the nodes ONCE, print out values, see where I am... the problem is thisp  pnode  nodenextSiblingp  pAlways returns false. Ive learned that I can do thisp  pnodeParentNextSibling and this will give me the next sibling instead. But heres a problemp  pParentNodeFirstChild will return the first element of that tree. But if I call ParentNodeNextSibling, for some reason it returns a pointer to the sibling, except its now one level higher on the tree.p  pThis is going to make looping a semi nightmare. p  pIm scouring a hrefhttpgrinninglizard.comtinyxml2docsclasstinyxml211xmlnode.html relnofollowhttpgrinninglizard.comtinyxml2docsclasstinyxml211xmlnode.htmla to find differences between using node, or element styles eg NextSiblingElement  but at best, I get one loop through with a failure, or just a crash. p  pThis parser doesnt work like the others, or I have the conventions wrong. Ive placed couts everywhere to see where I am, and the initial runs seem fine. Specifically NextSibling is causing issues, and I think I just dont know the tree structure that they intend to use.p  pThis is my nested loop as of now p  precode            for node  nodegtFirstChild node node  nodegtNextSibling                cout ltlt endl ltlt nodegtParentgtValue              for tempElement  nodegtFirstChildElement tempNode tempElement  tempElementgtNextSibling                   assign inner values                              take the inner values and assign them to an object              codepre  pSo, while my code matches all of the suggestions for traversing sibling elements, its failing. I could use some help from someone whos used this, as what I did in 30 minutes with every other system, is costing hours. p  pAlso, Im sure itll make more sense once their way is understood, but I cant find one working example on the internet of doing this. Plenty of ones suggesting the sample code I have not working.p  pFor the most part, TinyXML does find nodes and values, and if you remember that to get the type, you have to use nodeParentValue, then knowing where you are in a tree doesnt seem too hard.p  pJust for kicks, heres the load, which is workingp  precode    if doc.LoadFilexmlFilePath.cstr  XMLSUCCESS      XMLNode node  doc.RootElement     node  nodegtFirstChild root   .... codepre  pThanks for any assistance Would be greatly appreciated, and perhaps the only TinyXML2 question with a working answer for future askers, at least at this point in time.p  hr  pEDIT I cant answer yet, but I figured outp  pFor the love of... I hope Im doing something wrong, if youre doing this, pay attention to this pattern, it works Probably same for TinyXML2, Im guessing, just replace TiXmlNode with XMLNodep  pnote node refers to the root.p  pEssentially, think of the NextSibling as a function on the parent, where its laying out whos next.p  pThanks for the visits so far.

Negative 46564 pIn our application we use a EBS partition with a Mysql database. Eventually, we ran out of space and had to a bigger partition for the DB. We used the AWS panel functionality to create a new volume using a snapshot of the previous one. Mysql was stopped, and now we are using the new, bigger EBS partition.  However, we had noticeable degradation of the database performance. We are not sure how this could happen, since theoretically we are using the same Mysql configuration and the same database. Is it possible that maybe we have to rebuild indexes or reoptimize tables I am not sure if that would be worth anything, so we havent tried it yet because we are afraid it could slow down the database even more, and our application cannot be stopped easily, as it runs 247. Can anyone help pleasep

Note I had to hack the process from performing a clean build of everything to just translate the affected files during the commit, though, because it otherwise took too long to be a realtime commit operation in the future I expect we will drop this process in favor of something a little less interactive, e.g. hourly builds or whatnot.p  pAll of this backstory is simply to ask the question how does the user.dir property get setupp  pThis is my postcommit hook batch file everything is done on Windowsp  precodeSET REPO1 SET REV2  FOR  IN REPO DO SET REPONAMEn  SET BUILDROOTEbuilds IF NOT EXIST BUILDROOT  MKDIR BUILDROOT  SET BUILDDIRBUILDROOTREPONAME IF NOT EXIST BUILDDIR  MKDIR BUILDDIR  CD BUILDDIR  ECHO CD ECHO BUILDDIR  Capacheant1.8.3binant f Cdevshadowbuild.xml DWorkingDirBUILDDIRbuildworkdir DSvnRepoUrlfileREPO DFromRevisionREV gt BUILDDIRlastbuildresult.txt 2gtamp1 codepre  pthe last line is the actual Ant call you can see that Im redirecting the output to a file, which lives in the BUILDDIR, or Ebuilds. This file gets created as expected, which indicates to me that BUILDDIR was correctly setup and thus thep  precodeCD BUILDDIR codepre  pline should have executed. I understand that SVN kicks off the postcommit hook with an a hrefhttpsvnbook.redbean.comen1.1ch05s02.html relnofollowempty environmenta, but I would expect that changing the directory within it should preserve the state once kicking off Ant.p  pLater, in my Ant script, I setup my build.dir property thuslyp  precodeltproperty namebuild.dir valueuser.dir.build.build.time gt lt delete the build.dir, just in case we attempt a new build within the same minute...      TODO we may need to account for concurrent builds does SVN singlethread commits gt ltdelete dirbuild.dir gt ltmkdir dirbuild.dir gt codepre  pIf REPONAME in the batch file was DEMO, I expected the current working directory to be EbuildsDEMO and thus build.dir should be something like EbuildsDEMO.build.20120622.1127, but it is Cdevshadow.build.20120622.1127, instead.p  pAs I understand it, Ant is simply pulling in the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase1.4.2docsapijavalangSystem.htmlgetProperties2829 relnofollowSystem.Propertiesa from Java for things like user.dir  user.dir is described as emUsers current working directoryem. Clearly, based on my experimentation, something is getting crossed between the initial setup within the batch file and the invocation of Java with regards to the working directory. p  pDoes Ant change the working directory to the build files location I did not find any documentation to suggest it does, but its possible I simply overlooked something. I have ANTHOME defined, but given Subversions empty environment, it wouldnt be loaded...perhaps that has an effect I will need to investigate, but was hoping somebody might simply emknowem how this works.p  pEdit 201206221638p  pI tried setting up ANTHOME, JAVAHOME and JAVACMD, but to no avail.p

Negative 46564 pC more specifically, MinGWs implementation of g is getting confused. I have a mathematical Vector class that contains an arbitrary number of an arbitrary type of element. The element type and number of elements are specified at compile time.p  pThe Vector class is getting confused between one of its constructors and what I have dubbed the resize operator. The resize operator allows the programmer to cast a vector of one size into a vector of another arbitrary size. If the cast vector has more elements than the base vector, it pads with 1s. Heres the implementationp  precode   resize operator   T is the type of element the base vector holds   N is the number of elements the base vector holds   rN is the size of the new vector   templatelttypename T, unsigned int N, unsigned int rNgt operator VectorltT, rNgt const       VectorltT, rNgt resize      for unsigned int i  0 i lt rN i              resize[i]  i lt N  thisgtelements[i]  1           return resize  codepre  pThe vector class also has a typesafe variadic constructor that can take any number of any combinations of elements which must be of type T and any number of Vectors which can contain any number of elements and must be of type T so long as the number of bare elements added to the number of elements in the supplied vectors is equal to the number of elements that the constructing vector contains.p  pThus this would be validp  precodevec3 foovec21, 2, 3 codepre  pbut not this.p  precodevec3 barvec41, 2, 3, 4, 5 codepre  pI ensure that the proper number of elements has been supplied at compile time by recursing through them all with a counter, then I use a static assertion to make sure the counter ends up at number of elements the vector can contain. This normally works out well, except for the following codep  precodevec4 bar1, 2, 3, 4 vec3 bar PROBLEM HERE codepre  pWhats happening is that the C thinks that vec3 bar is asking for the variadic constructor when, in fact, it should be calling the resize operator. Ive tried making them explicit, but it hasnt worked. How do I ensure that C uses the resize operator when I have the above code and not the variadic constructorp  pIn short, how do I tell C to use thisp  precoderesize operator templatelttypename T, unsigned int N, unsigned int rNgt VectorltT, Ngtoperator VectorltT, rNgt codepre  pinstead of thisp  precodeconstructor templatelttypename T, unsigned int N, typename ...

I dont know why.p  pbANOTHER EDITBp  pMaking the constructor explicit allows implicit casts to work, but not explicit ones. Which is to say that this code worksp  precodevec3 foo  someVec4 codepre  pBut this code still gives me a static assertion failurep  precodevec3 foo  staticcastltvec3gtsomeVec4 codepre  pWhich makes basically no sense because I declared the variadic constructor explicit, and thus it shouldnt be called there.p  pAlso, upon request, heres an a hrefhttppastebin.com1Rg5QzJx relnofollowSSCCEap  pThe TLDR version of this is that my code is calling an explicit constructor when I try to explicitly call the typecasting operator, but not when I try to implicitly call it.p

For every category I chose several which I show on the first page. If the screen size resolution is small e.g. on a tablet, I only want to show 34 items per category. On a large screen I could probably show 10 items. Otherwise there will be very much unused, empty space. On the detailpage this is no problem, because I show all items and it automatically adjusts to the bigger screen size.p  pThis is also the intention of Steven Sinofsky Microsoft as he has written in his a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combb8archive20120321scalingtodifferentscreens.aspx relnofollowBlogPosta.p  pThis is the mockup of my app on a small screen.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comk33aU.png altWin8 RT app mockup on small screenp  pThanks for your hintsp

Negative 46564 pIm having some issues with output from a fortran application being executed from within Matlab.  We use Matlab to call a number of fortran applications and to display output and results.  p  pIm using gfortran on OSX to build one of these programs, which does a large amount of file output and a little output to stdout to track progress.  stdout output is accomplished mainly through print  statements, but Ive tried write  ,   as well.

However, when the program is executed from within matlab, there is no output from stdout.  The file output works fine though.  p  pAdditionally, the same code, when compiled with Intels ifort, displays its output in matlab without issue.  Unfortunately I dont have regular access to the Intel compiler.p  pIm positive that the output is going to stdout not stderr, and Ive tried flushing both from within the code call flush6 amp call flush0, but this doesnt seem to make a difference.  p  pIm not sure what could be causing this.

Without the original compiler, we cant figure out how to look at or use them. We also have a semiequivalent library file thats actually a .FOR file. For all we know, the BPROP.FOR and BPROP.LIB could be the same file they were found in the same source code area. If we use the BPROP.FOR file, the program can compile, but we are having issues with results that weve traced down to information that is usedgatheredprocessed in that file. p  pHowever, we do have 32bit versions of what we think are the same .lib files.

If I hit return to open a file selected from nerdtree, it doesnt do anything. In macvim, it works ok.p  pIs there any guide on how to use vim on mac Or what is the recommended wayp

Negative 46564 pIm wondering if I could get some opinions on whether this development project would be new and useful, or if it has already been done before.p  pIve been researching an idea that I have to create a premade solution for a Dynamic ServerSide Mobile Template solution. In my previous job I was tasked with maintaining multiple mobile clients, each of them having a custom UI skin. Normally this ends up requiring a lot of developer time when clients request UI changes or updates. My goal is to design a system that requires minimal developer input and allows designers complete control over the UI, includingp  ul liAbility to update content any timeli liVersion control push new template designs to client, rollback to previous versionsli liNo need for developer input for design changesli ul  pWhat Im brainstorming is a server side service module which is capable of providing templates on demand using RESTFul web services. The server would provide an HTML input function that would decompose any HTML page to a component tree. The component tree would then be saved to the database and displayed for confirmation amp editing.p  pThe server would be responsible forp  ul liDecomposing any HTML page into its template components ul li3rd party files such a JS, CSS referenced by pathli ulli liDisplaying HTML component tree for debuging and editing purposesli liSaving template component details in the database with versioningli liProviding template on demand via JSON or XML through RESTFul APIli ul  pThe client could be written using a hrefhttpmustache.github.com relnofollow titlemustachemustachea and easily ported to the various mobile devices using the various offshoots iOS, Android, etc. This thin client would simply send a request to the configured URI designated by the server. The URI would return all template information using mustache syntax, and this would be used to dynamically build the UI on demand. The client could also save the UI configuration and reload only when a new version is released.p  pTo summarize, the client would be responsible forp  ul liRequesting template data JSON or XML from predefined URLli liRendering template using mustache, assuming version not already saved.li ul  pI would love to start this as an open source project if the demand or need is there, and Im not reinventing the wheel. So far Ive found similar concepts but none seem to be fully dynamic.p

That scheme has been blown out of the water by this situation I have where the IP address is not at all what I would expect.p
Negative 46564 pI have looked at all the similar questions, but in my opinion, none of them give a solid answer to this. I have a test class JUnit 4 but also interested in JUnit 3 and I want to run individual test methods from within those classes programmaticallydynamically not from the command line. Say, there are 5 test methods but I only want to run 2. How can I achieve this programmaticallydynamically not from the command line, Eclipse etc..p  pAlso, there is the case where there is a codeBeforecode annotated method in the test class. So, when running an individual test method, the codeBeforecode should run beforehand as well. How can that be overcomep  pThanks in advance.p

What would you advice me to do to get the same effectp  pAdditionally  I have no idea how to write good destructor for this  how to delete QThread smoothly and all the class objects..p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pFor now I believe the solution is quite alright  the only problem left is how to write a destructor for that. I have no idea how it can be done here.p

Negative 46564 pI have an ASP.NET MVC 3 project using .NET framework 4.0 and LINQ to SQL.

Negative 46564 pAs part of a program I am writing, I wish to print an image to SVG format.  I need it to be in SVG format, so that I can modify it using Adobe Illustrator later on.

Negative 46564 pI am unsure if I should use or not Android SQLite database with my Android program.p  pThe program has several tables, and I have operations for quering, updating and displaying these tables. However the total amount of data is not very large maybe tens of rows at most. p  pI was told by some people that I should not use databases any more as storing everything into flat files is easier to implement, the finished implementation is easier to maintain and the database engine can be replaced by collection framework that stores preloaded flat files. These people have some weight in decision making so I need argumentation if I still want to use the database.p  pWould it be possible to get argumentation when Android SQLite database should and when it should not be usedp

Problem was, that keydown does not work in Firefox so only keyup did the magic trick with listening for ESC. p  pWorking fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netaGpNf190httpjsfiddle.netaGpNf190ap  pstrongSOLUTION UPDATEstrong In the end I had to listen for both keydown and keyup events. Because in my case FF does reset input field on ESC keydown to previous state, so it messed up my model. So keyup clears the model and keydown checks if model is empty and does appropriate action. I also need to manually defocus input to prevent text popping back in. p

Negative 46564 pI am wondering if it is possible  and if so how to use Google Checkout Merchant Sandbox for the android inapp purchases, for testing.  I know that what happens now is that even test accounts are charged for the test purchases.

Negative 46564 pFirst, please do not flame me as I am new to programming and PHP. I am a student trying to step outside of the comfort of foundation in a classroom and work on my first project. I have performed a search, my problem is I am not even sure how to word what I am looking for and am curious if I am overlooking a simple solution. I have tried searching for every variation of nested or tree that I think would associate with this problem but am having problems finding something that answers my question.p  pI am trying to list members that were referred by other members in a nested tree i.e. if John sponsored Mary, Mike, and Tom and Mike sponsored Megan and Susan, and Susan sponsored Betty and Michelle I want to be able to display something likep  ol liJohn ul liMaryli liMike ul liMeganli liSusan ul liBettyli liMichelleli ulli ulli liTom li ulli ol  pI would like to be able to specify the depth to search for example I only needed to display 5 levels deep if needed. For this I was thinking of a codefor i0ilt4icodep  precodequery  SELECT fname, lname, userid FROM USER WHERE sponsorid  SELECT userid FROM USER WHERE username  SESSION[username] result  mysqliquerycon, query   while row  mysqlifetchrowresult    echo ltulgtltligtrow[0] row[1]ltligt   subquery  SELECT fname, lname, userid FROM USER WHERE sponsorid  row[2]   subresult  mysqliquerycon, subquery   while row2  mysqlifetchrowsubresult      echo ltulgtltligtrow2[0] row2[1]ltligtltulgt          codepre  pThis was my last attempt to figure out the general required structure which didnt exactly work. I am pretty sure I can make this work at any level desired if I want to keep making this deeper and nest further but what if I wanted to return 100 levels... seems there is a simple structure that I am just overlooking.p  pAny guidance would be appreciated, even a link to help explain this if you know how to search for what I am looking for I would be happy to read and learn myself, thanksp  hr  pI found the answer after reading everyones comments and doing a lot of searching. What I am looking for is an adjacency list or closure table.

Negative 46564 pI am developing a Dynamic web project Java EE using JSF, PrimeFaces, JPA, and running on Tomcat 7.

In past, when I developed some little things as exercises in Java SE, I used to use the following database propertiesp  precodejdbc.driverscom.mysql.jdbc.Driver jdbc.urljdbcmysqllocalhost3306testuseUnicodetrueampampcharacterEncodingutf8 jdbc.usernameroot jdbc.passwordpassword codepre  pBut now I am learning JPA on Java EE.p  pIn the book Pro JPA 2 Mastering the Java trade Persistance API, Chapter 3, paragraph Packaging It Up you can readp  blockquote   pIn the Java EE environment, many properties required in the   persistence.xml file for Java SE can be omitted. In Listing 332, you   see the persistence.xml file from Listing 211 converted for   deployment as part of a Java EE application. Instead of JDBC   properties for creating a connection, we now declare that the entity   manager should use the data source name jdbcEmployeeDS. If the data   source was defined to be available in the application namespace   instead of the local component naming context then we might instead   use the data source name of javaappjdbcEmployeeDS. The   transaction type attribute has also been removed to allow the   persistence unit to default to JTA. The application server will   automatically find entity classes, so even the list of classes has   been removed. This example represents the ideal minimum Java EE   configuration. Because the business logic that uses this persistence   unit is implemented in a stateless session bean, the persistence.xml   file would typically be located in the METAINF directory of the   corresponding EJB JAR.p blockquote  pstrongListing 332.

Negative 46564 pI writing a document editor of sorts. The application is written in WPF and needs to be able to handle multiple documents within the same process. Each document has its own editor window with is own Ribbon kinda like the way Word does it.p  pI would like to use DI patterns in the application, so f.ex. a SaveManager class could be injected with the document it is supposed to save. Obviously the container cant create the whole object graph at application start up, because the user may choose to open or create a new document at a later time. The normal way to handle this, is to use an abstract factory, but does that means i need a factory for every class that operates on the document. Im expecting a lot of classes will need a reference to the document and I dont want to jump through hoops just for the sake of DI. Is there a way to let the container manage the documents lifetime, handing out the right document instance at the right time.p  pBest regards,br Terjep

I would appreciate some sample code and the comments for each step to see how things are working.p  pThis is the code i have so far, but is not fully working.

Tested with 50,000, 1 lakh, 3 lakh, 5 lakh data files as well and the performance rate or the rate at which the script is executed is proportional. There is enough memory free in the server. The mongostat output when the script was running is pasted below. My questions is, I believe the script is executing close to 5000 queries per second.

I have the following problemp  pI need to replace the word Cart from the top right menu with an icon of a cart as part of my project. What my theme does in its codefunctions.phpcode file is to create two codeacode links to the Carts contents PoP Up element. The first is the word Cart and the second is the cart product counter. p  pWhat I have tried is to add the following CSS properties by adding the class codecmagnetcartcode to the second, in order to include the cart icon.p  precode.cmagnetcart     background urlhttpwww.athlokinisi.grimagesshoppingcart.png norepeat 10px 6px     minwidth 45px     textalign right     backgroundsize auto 17px  codepre  pI have added the class to the appropriate element at the codefunctions.php cartShow functioncode where it is originally generated. As you can see, the problem is that when page loads, it shows the icon perfectly on position and then there is a javascript reload of some WooCommerce parameters and hides it again, by returning to its original values. Thus, without my added class.p  pAfter contacting the Adamas Theme Support team at PremiumCoding and after several tickets which took place for over 2 weeks, it was pointed out to me that I need to make an alteration at WooCommerces JS function, perhaps the codecartfragment.jscode. The problem is that nothing makes sense to me in there and I really cannot find where to make the code alteration in order for the Javascripts second load to include my function or exclude this element from double loading. The Suport team there couldnt assist me further.p  pI would appreciate endlessly any help as well as an explanation of why this happens. It doesnt make any sense to me why to load some elements two times.p  pTo add two additional information  I know that when I fix the issue I will just hide probably by putting in comments the first codeacode link which prints the word Cart  The last response I got from support was the following in case it is of any help p  blockquote   peven if you replace text with icon after loading WooCommerce Ajax,   text will be back. So you will need to change WooCommerce js function   or translate all WooCommerce plugin and theme with WPML plugin and   string translation module.p blockquote  pstrongExtended infostrong In general its not enough for me to just replace the first codeacode link that says Cart with the carts image, because it doesnt solve my bigger problem which includes the following I am using Greek language for this project and the theme has many codeuppercasecode CSS elements. There are some problems with this because Greek words in uppercase cannot be automatically transformed because you have to remove the accents from the vowels. Therefore, I had made a jQuery functions which runs on document ready and corrects this problem, but due to the aforementioned problem of the double load it returns all text back to the previous state.p
Negative 46564 pMy client has request for a page with sponsor names that move around on the screen max 20 names, and the sponsor names must never overlap. Each name is a slightly different font size and the initial start position of each name on a page load is supposed to be random. I havent done something like this before. I was thinking about placing the sponsor names within divs or span tags and then doing the required logic on these containers for easier defined boundaries. Im looking for some help in moving the divs around with the use of something like setTimeout, or a JS plugin if one exists, and also some assistance with the collision detection of the names. I am also open to CSS transitionbased solutions as it will be a self contained installation which we have full control over browser being used, etc.p  pOnce these effects are achieved, I will be using page transitions or impress.js to zoom into detailed sponsor information pages and back out to the same overview moving text page. I should be able to deal with this portion myself though.p  pThanks in advance for any help that you can give.p

Basically, if userexists holds any results, I want to produce an error and rerender the form, and if its empty, I want to continue on with storing a users data. How can I tell if userexists contains a result or notp  pI have tried, p  precodeif userexists codepre  pbut this condition passes every time. That is, it is always true for every name I pass in, whether it already exists or not. p  pI also tried,p  precodeif lenuserexists gt 0 codepre  pbut get the error that a Gql query object has no len. If userexists is a Gql query object, how could I extract some sort of list from this in order to simply check its contents in the way I am attempting top  pI have in the past iterated through such an object with a for loop in a jinja template, and I assumed that this object could also be treated like an iterable, such as a list, in general.p

Negative 46564 pIm currently working on a chat app for Android, and I understand that it needs an intermediary server as a point of contact between clients. I also get that XMPP is a tried and tested solution but however Im primarily a C developer and would like to invest my time in WebSockets, because from what Ive read I believe its both strongfaststrong and stronglightweightstrong, though it needs a handshake of some sort.p  pSo right now Ive downloaded a hrefhttpwebsocket4net.codeplex.com relnofollowWebSocket4Neta which is a fork from a hrefhttpsuperwebsocket.codeplex.com relnofollowSuperWebSocketa. Im able to create a codeWebSocketcode object with a local URL of sorts, and I understand that a hrefhttpautobahn.wsandroid relnofollowAutobahna is a viable WebSockets client library for Android. What I emdont understandem however, is how Im going to get my Android client to connect to the web server without a LAN connection, but rather over the Internet.p  pRight now I think that a possible solution would be to expose a WCF endpoint which then plays well with the codeWebSocketcode, but then again that would add to the roundtrip time, defeating the purpose of WebSockets implementation in the first place... lightweightedness I might as well just make do with simply WCF services as that point of contact.p  pMy question then is whats the URL that my Android client will interact withp

Negative 46564 pIs it recommended to store certain data in a configfile while referencing to it by ID in database Specifically, when storing information thats rarely or never updated.p  pFor example, I may have different roles for users in my application. As these roles are hardly ever or never updated, is it really necessary to store them in a coderolescodetable and reference to them by ID in codeuserscode I could as well have the roles defined in an array. This way the database wouldnt need to be called every time to get role information which is required on every page.p  pAnother option would be to cache the whole bunch of roleinformation from the database. Not sure if this is any better than simply having an array stored somewhere.p  pThe same question can be asked when storing any applicationrelated data thats not edited by the users but the developers.p

Negative 46564 pOkay, so I am working on an ASP.Net website C code behind where, for troubleshooting reasons most of our clients that call for tech support dont know what OSBrowserBrowserVersion they are using, we want to log a system profile so to speak so that we can more easily troubleshoot OSBrowser related issues.p  pCurrently, I am using codeRequest.UserAgentcode. The problem with this is that it returns a string that is unhelpful to our support staffp  blockquote   blockquote     pMozilla5.0 Windows NT 6.1 rv24.0 Gecko20100101 Firefox24.0p   blockquote blockquote  pWhat I want to do is to pull just the OS Windows NT 6.1, or whatever OS the user has by itself, without the additional browser information, as I am already segregating other system information as suchp  blockquote   blockquote     p UserID  UserOS  BrowserType  BrowserName  MajorVersion  MinorVersion  IsBeta  p          p 11111   userOS   Firefox24.0      Firefox        24          0        0  p   blockquote blockquote  pIs it possible just to get the OS by itselfp  pBonus points if you know how to get the OS Friendly name from a client machine i.e. Windows 7 vs Windows NT 6.1, this would save me from having to create a separate database of OS numbers.p
Negative 46564 pI have a huge number of git repositories on an onsite linux server that I need to back up daily to an offsite windows server.  Because there are so many files, I want to use rsync instead of plain copy to save time and network bandwidth.  I will use rsync after mounting the windows destination drive.  I also want to avoid a solution that tars up all the files or otherwise compresses them into one big file.  This is because the offsiteserver is further replicated to other offsite servers, and if I uses a big tar file, instead of just having to copy the 1 or 2 small files that changed, the entire big tar file will have to be copied. 1p  pMy question is, should I or should I not use the delete flag codedeletecode on rsyncbr The delete flag on rsync will delete files found on the destination but not on the source.  I would ideally like to leave the delete flag off, because if a wanted file accidentally got deleted from the source, it would also get deleted on the destination. By no using the delete flag, we risk having the destination be a superset of all the files we want.  p  pIs this a problem Would this somehow corrupt the git repositories on the destination If it makes a difference in your answer, we only allow fastforward commits to be pushed to our onsite git server.  Maybe its the case that git will never delete files in the .git directory if only fastforward commits are donep  p1 Edit 1 Add note about wanting to avoid solutions that compress multiple files into one.  Thus git bundle wouldnt be a wanted solution.  If rsync isnt the way to go, Id love to know of any alternative approach you recommend.  p

Negative 46564 pI am working on this example from last many days and didnt came across to any solution related to GeckoView not able to load, When ever you try to launch the geckobrowser sample app available on github it throws error as inflate exception in line 29, for    This is what causing the error, its not able to fine GeckoView class but when I searched, Its available in project.p  pI needed to use GeckoView because I am working on loading html5 webpages which are not responding properly in normal android webview previous to kitkat 4.4.....on kitkat everything works fine as the chromium stuff enhanced and added on. So to make my app compatible to earlier version we tried on loading html5 pages to mozilla which seems to be working fine till an extent and then thought of using its Geckoview in our app. But the example itself seems to be not working. If anyone has tried it or have an idea, really the help will be appreciated. Thanks.p

A moving object is tracked per frame and the 2d coordinates of each frame is individually saved to a 2x1 matrix that is overwritten for each frame.

Negative 46564 pIve hit the internet pretty hard for this one over the past couple of weeks. I havent used SOAP in a very long time and last I did all my wsdl service references worked. So heres the problem. I try to generate a service reference from the provided online wsdl java based JAXWS I think. This service does not allow the GET verb for the metadata so it fails there. I then downloaded the wsdl and fixed the directory issues pointed it at the right xsds and viola it worked, however theres no methods to be found in this service, Im supposed to just post a specific soap xml document to a url. The kicker here is I need to use the provided X509 certificate to sign the content and append a header to said xml using wssecurity.

Negative 46564 pIm coding an experimental design and I need to be able to play sounds from a number of speakerschannels and then have the user press a corresponding key when they believe the sound is coming from a certain speakerchannel. ie Participant thinks sound is coming from speaker 4 so presses key 4.

The project builds a simple 2view ToDo List app. The main view is a list of todo items, and the second view uses a text field to add a new todo item.  The views are linked by a navigation controller.p  pCurrently, the user adds an item by entering it in the text field and pressing the Done UIBarButtonItem. Id like to set it up so pressing the Return key in the text field triggers the same action as pressing Done.p  pIve searched on StackOverflow and elsewhere and Ive looked at the relevant Apple docs, and I cant figure out how to make what seems like a simple connection. So Im wondering if the fact that the Done button is a navigation control which triggers a Segue and an UnwindToList  means I cant easily link it to the Return key.p  pBased on the answers Ive found here, Ive set the ViewController up to be the text fields delegatep  pin the .h filep  precodeinterface XYZAddToDoItemViewController  UIViewController ltUITextFieldDelegategt codepre  pin the .m filep  precodeself.textField.delegate  self codepre  pAnd Ive added the function p  precode BOOLtextFieldShouldReturnUITextField textField    codepre  pBut I cant figure out how to use that function to trigger the Done button pressed event. The view controller has a PrepareForSegue method which checks the text field and saves the data in it, so presumably I have to call that method and then initiate the segue, but I cant figure out how to do that manually, since the Navigation Controller normally handles it.p

Negative 46564 pIm working on a research project and I need a NLP program to detect sentences in many different circumstances. I was advised to use OpenNLP and I am convinced to use it after reading its wiki pages. So, I use OpenNLP in order to detect sentences as well as any words or phrases which are not belong to a sentence also called sentence fragments.p  pOpenNLP accepts .txt files as input if you want to redirect the input. If you want to use .doc file as input, you have to convert it to a .txt file. My problem starts right here.p  pI have many different files in different formats. I would like to detect sentences in each file if they consist any text. Therefore, I started to convert each potentially text containing file to a .txt file. The conversion process is not perfect. For example, if a sentence too long say longer than a line, then conversion tool gets the both lines of the sentence as separated sentences. This results OpenNLP produces each line as different sentences because of eoln character at the end of the first line.p  pMy question is, is there anyway that I can parameterize or configure OpenNLP to recognize whole sentence first and second line togetherp
Negative 46564 pDoes anyone know how to crop an image with spritekit for iOS using an irregular shape node The problem is when I do an skcrop on it, the shape has 2 layers, and thus the cropping fails. To crop one must use a single layer. Any idea how to rasterize a shape first, before the scene is loaded Ive tried skeffectnode and shouldRasterize on it but that fails too, most likely because it contains 2 children as well, or the rasterization is occuring after the scene is loaded. Ive also tried converting the shape to a texture, but that fails for the same reasons as the skeffectnode does. Ive looked at other possible solutions on stack overflow, and none seem to work or are very limited to squares, so Im thinking this is a bug that must exist only in iOS7, so please dont say this is a duplicate without letting me check out the duplicate first to make sure that it really is one.p  pRight now all signs point to not using an skshapenode with a fill to crop an image.p

Negative 46564 pIm working on a final project for school with a Java applet that counts down from a given interval to zero. When a Rectangle on screen experiences a mouse down event, it is supposed to execute the timer however this does not occur the program ends up crashing. Ive seen a lot of examples of timers online, but many are using Javas built in timer class, which I am not using. I figured there must be a more basic way to do a simple timer. All variables have been declared at the top of the class.p  precodepublic boolean mouseDownEvent e, int x, int y          ifstart.insidex,y              timerAct  true         startTime  System.currentTimeMillis  1000         endTime  startTime  interval          while System.currentTimeMillis  1000 lt endTime              while startTime  System.currentTimeMillis  1000                  startTime  1                 timeLeft  endTime  startTime                               timerAct  false          repaint     return true  codepre  pThe logic seems to workout okay because this began as System.out.println, and it worked just fine.   Then, it was converted to store the variable timeLeft. In the paint method, I have p  precode    g.drawStringTime   timeLeft, 420, 180 codepre  pto print the the time remaining. I also have the update method but it doesnt seem to make a difference. And I know the issue isnt because Im changing a variable. My mouse down method has an if statement with a different rectangle that tracks clicks not shown, and it updates a counter of clicks on screen in the applet window without any issue. Any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 46564 pI am new to the whole SQL Server  TSQL area but I am basically trying to update a row in my database with a particular function and cant seem to find out how to do it. p  pFirst there are 2 columns codelatitudecode which has a value and codeTenLatMincode which is null what I first do is check for all the null valuesp  precodeSelect   from zipcodes  where TenLatMin is null  DECLARE LATMIN FLOAT DECLARE convert FLOAT  SET convert .14493  I would like to get the latitudes from the Select and plug it there SET LATMIN roundlatitude  convert,8  Then do the calculation and update the field update zipcodes  set TenLatMin  codepre  pThe codeselectcode works because I get a list of all the Null values now what I want to do is get the codelatitudecode of each row that has a Null value and use that inside the small codeLATMINcode calculation so that then I can set codeTenLatMincode to that value.. p  pAny suggestions would be great and as I said before each row already has a latitude value .p
Negative 46564 pSince a few days ago that Im trying to make a game using XNA. Im using tiles for my game and Ive decided to make it look isometrical. Ive seen tutorials that explain how to do a game engine using matrices for the position of the tiles but since its so much work to do it that way I decided to use Tiled for making my maps so much easier and graphical.p  pIve made my map 30x30 tiles and each tile has 64x32, also Ive put objects underneath each element where I dont want the character to walk but when I see the XML file made by Tiled, each object has its coords acording the edges of the map and no the left and upper sides of the window.p  pIve already tried to transform those coords passing them to orthogonal coords or even trying to rotate the objects but with any successful result.p  pI dont know if there is some way of fixing this or maybe Im doing something wrong.p  pId be pleased if someone could give me a solution to fix those coords or some indications to make an isometrical tiled game, because Ive seen that some people say that its too easy but I find it harder as I thought.p  pAny help will be well appreciated.p
Negative 46564 pI am trying to write a V4L2 compliant driver for a special camera device i have, but the device doesnt seem particularly friendly with V4L2s buffer system.  Instead of the separately allocated buffers, it wants a single contiguous block of memory capable of holding a set  of buffers usually 4, and it then provides a status register telling you which is the latest updated after each frame is DMAed to the host.  So it basically needs only a single large DMA allocated memory chunk to work with, not 4 mostlikely separated.p  pHow can I use this with V4L  Everything I see about codeVIDIOCCREATEBUFScode, codeVIDIOCREQBUFScode and such does internal allocation of the buffers, and I cant get anything V4Lbased like codeqv4l2code to work without a successful codeQBUFcode and codeDQBUFcode that uses their internal structure.p  pHow can this be donep

Negative 46564 pI am trying to run a programming club in my school and its not practical to physically connect the Pis to kb, mouse and monitor so they all autorun VNC and we connect to the machines using UltraVNC. The programs are written in a shared directory and Eclipse C runs on the host therefore all program output is viewed via VNC.p  pEverything was fine while programming in Python and when we started to use C.  However, I hit a  brik wall when trying to get graphics to display.  I could build a program that appeared to run, but which only gave terminal output  it would never display drawings on the screen.  While trying to solve the problem and at one point connected a keyboard and mouse and noticed that they seemed to be recognised laser came on, Caps Lock toggled, etc. but they didnt do anything when movedtyped on.p  pEventually the penny began to teater on the edge as I got increasingly confused as to why no one else was having this problem given that there seem to be a lot of people using openvg and I began to wonder more about the kbmouse issue.p  pI tried plugging the HDMI output into a monitor at home shool ones are still analogue dsub and lo and behold, the physical kb and mouse worked. Then it got really strangep  pSomehow I have 2 desktops running at the same time. The physical keyboard and mouse control one and VNC controls the other.  If I start a terminal window on Physical desktop, it doesnt show up on VNC desktop and vice versa  they seem to be independent, although thats not quite true.p  pWhen I run the graphics executable on Physical desktop, it works fine and can be controlled only using the physical kb. When I run it on VNC desktop, it can be controlled only with the VNC kb but the output displays on the physical screen.p  pI really dont get thisp  pI kind of need to be able to run the programs over VNC, but I need to be able to tell the code I run which desktop to output to as it seems to default to the wrong one.  Actually, it would be prefferable to get VNC to connect to the existing HDMI desktop rather than starting a new one but I cannot findout how to tell tightVNC to do that.p  pThe code is here, but I think the problem might be in the init function which is in a library, so it is probably better to get VNC on to the right desktop...p  pThanks in advance for any helpp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltunistd.hgt  extern C  include VGopenvg.h include VGvgu.h include fontinfo.h include shapes.h   using namespace std  int main void   int width, height         VGfloat w2, h2, w     char s[3]      initampwidth, ampheight                                       Graphics initialization      w2  VGfloatwidth2     h2  VGfloatheight2     w   VGfloatw      Startwidth, height                                        Start the picture     Background0, 0, 0                                         Black background     Fill44, 77, 232, 1                                        Big blue marble     Circlew2, 0, w                                            The world     Fill255, 255, 255, 1                                      White text     TextMidw2, h2, hello, world, SerifTypeface, width10    Greetings     End                                                       End the picture     fgetss, 2, stdin                                          Pause until RETURN]     finish                                                    Graphics cleanup     exit0  codepre

Negative 46564 pI have a long PHPHTML form, which users will fill in. I need a way to be able to save the form, so that the user can access the partially filled form and continue filling it at a later time. The form is linked to a MySQL database. When the page is first opened the blank form is displayed. Once the user presses Submit, the user data goes into the database. How can I save a partially filled out form, so that a user can exit the application, log out, and log in later to continue filling out the formp  pFurther clarification I am thinking that a possible solution may be to create a record in the database when the user clicks Save. My question is mainly how to retrieve the saved form.

Negative 46564 pI am writing code that I want to distribute to 3rd party Android developers to include in their projects. p  pI am using Eclipse and am creating a .jar for the 3rd party to include.p  pI want to use the koushIon networking library in my project to make network calls. p  pI am writing code that depends on Ion and everything builds in eclipse and a .jar is created.

Negative 46564 pIm using a codeTitledPanescode with codeTableViewscode in them. Every codeTableViewcode shouldnt be able to change its width. Therefore I set the codecolumnResizePolicycode to codeTableView.CONSTRAINEDRESIZEPOLICYcode. There are 3 columns. The first should have a fix width and the other 2 should be flexible. So I set the coderesizablecode properties to realize that. Everything works fine, the controls are shown, data is shown properly, but when I start the application one explicit codeTableViewcode doesnt render like it should. Its width is about 75 of the width it should have. When I resize the columns by draging the line between the headers just by 1 pixel, the whole codeTableViewcode is okay.  I tried to setManaged to true, but that doesnt help. I also tried some bindings, but also without a positive result.

Negative 46564 pPDFs are made up of many individual text objects. Often, these objects are put in the order they appear in the document, so extracting document text is as simple as reading the text objects in the order they appear in the PDF stream.p  pHowever, many PDFs do not play so nice.p  pThe PDF spec does not require that the text be ordered in any way within the PDF stream.  It is not uncommon to see PDFs where the end of the PDF is at the start of the stream, the middle is at the end, and the start is in the middle. In the extreme case, the stream is a jumble of text boxes in no order.p  pWhat algorithms exist for determining the proper text flow of the objects in the PDF stream  p  pFor simple documents, ordering the text isnt too hard You order the objects top to bottom and left to right, and then extract the text from the most top left text boxes, working your way down. However, documents often have multiple columns, titles, subheadings, headers, footers,  tabbed paragraphs, etc.  Are there any solutions that are robust in many different situationsp  pFor clarity, below is an example of a function prototype that I am trying to implement.p  pcodedef sortaccordingtotextflowobjs, pagewidth, pageheight     objs               A list of objects where each object is a dict containing         x, y           The topleft corner position of the text box         width, height  The width and height of the text box         text           A string of the text     pagewidthheight  Widthheight of the page     returns the list of objects, ordered for natural reading codep  pLets assume for the moment, that were only dealing with lefttoright languages.p

Negative 46564 pI am creating an app that uses Parse cloud. I am trying to send a message from a user to all others. After writing the message in a textfield and pressing send, the delegate calls the following method and the push is handled as shown belowp  precode BOOLtextFieldShouldReturnUITextField textField  hide keyboard [textField resignFirstResponder]  NSString message  self.broadcastText.text  create a user query PFQuery query  [PFUser query] PFUser current  [PFUser currentUser] NSString currentUsername  current[username] [query whereKeyusername notEqualTocurrentUsername]  send push in background PFPush push  [[PFPush alloc] init] [push setQueryquery] [push setMessagemessage] [push sendPushInBackground]  clear text field textField.text    return YES codepre  pWhats happening is when I send the message, the sender in this case me is receiving the push notification as well. What I tried to do is get the current users username and then create a user query that queries for all users whose usernames are not equal to the current users username.p  pHowever, it didnt work, the message was also being sent to all users including the sender.p  pNote I also tried using [query whereKeyusername notEqualTocurrentUsername] just for debugging, and when I try to send the message, neither the sender nor any other device receives it. when actually no one should receive it except the sender.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.p

Negative 46564 pIve been tasked with optimizing a mature 2D Unity project.  The biggest performance hiccup occurs when the app plays particle animations, so Im trying to prerender the graphics containing these animations into a spritesheet using a RenderTexture at runtime the storage restrictions prevent me from doing this as a preprocessing step.  Ive added a camera to the project and in the constructor for the GameObjects in question, I supply the camera with a RenderTexture, position it a fixed distance from the object, and then call the objects animator.Update1.0f30 while moving the camera viewport across the RenderTexture, thereby rendering the frames.  It works, mostly.  The problem is the particle systems dont render, and the animation doesnt seem to advance properly, though it does advance.

Negative 46564 pI am new to iOS and I have a question about finding the current user location. I am reading in Apple documentation p  blockquote   pDisplaying the Users Current Location on the Map Map Kit includes   builtin support for displaying the users current location on the   map. To show this location, set the showsUserLocation property of your   map view object to YES. Doing so causes the map view to use Core   Location to find the users location and add an annotation of type   MKUserLocation to the map.p      pThe addition of the MKUserLocation annotation object to the map is   reported by the delegate in the same way that custom annotations are.   If you want to associate a custom annotation view with the users   location, you should return that view from your delegate objects   mapViewviewForAnnotation method. If you want to use the default   annotation view, return nil from that method. To learn more about   adding annotations to a map, see Annotating Maps.p blockquote  pAnd it sounds great.

Negative 46564 pim working on a project were I need to sort changing numbers of keyvalue pairs. When the number of keys to sort grows the code gets very slow. p  pIn order to speed this up I was looking at using thrustsort, but I was surprised by its bad performance at low 16 000 numbers of objects. According to this article a hrefhttpdevblogs.nvidia.comparallelforallthinkingparallelpartiiitreeconstructiongpu relnofollowherea they sort 12k objects in 0.18 mS, but when I run thrust, it never goes under 1 mS. I have run the code on both Quadro K2100m and GTX 970.p  pIn neither case was it worth sorting on the GPU unless the number of objects was higher than ca 50k. p  pDoes someone know how thrustsort performs in the range 11000k elements Are are my results reasonable or have i done something wrong Here is the code I use I realize i sort pairs on the CPU and keyvalue on the GPU, but pair sorting on GPU is much slower than keyvaluep  precodeinclude ltcudaruntimeapi.hgt include ltdevicelaunchparameters.hgt include ltthrustdevicevector.hgt include ltthrusthostvector.hgt include ltthrustsort.hgt include ltalgorithmgt include ltrandomgt include ltWindows.hgt include ltstdint.hgt  int main LARGEINTEGER start, stop, freq double duration QueryPerformanceFrequencyampfreq int n[N]  1024, 4096, 16384, 65536, 262144, 1048576, 4194304, 16777216 printfN tttCPUstd tGPUthrustn forint i  0 i lt N i       printfd, n[i]     stddefaultrandomengine e     stduniformintdistributionltuint64tgt  u0,n[i]      thrusthostvectorltthrustpairltuint64t, uint64tgtgt CPUVecn[i]     thrusthostvectorltuint64tgt HOSTVECn[i]     thrusthostvectorltuint64tgt values1n[i]      forint k  0 k lt n[i] k         uint64t val1, val2         val1  ue val2  ue         CPUVec[k]  thrustmakepairval1, val2         HOSTVEC[k]  val1         values1[k]  val2           QueryPerformanceCounterampstart     stdsortCPUVec.begin, CPUVec.end     QueryPerformanceCounterampstop     duration  doublestop.QuadPart  start.QuadPartdoublefreq.QuadPart      ifn[i] lt 10000000         printftttf, duration     else         printfttf, duration      QueryPerformanceCounterampstart      thrustdevicevectorltuint64tgt DVEC  HOSTVEC     thrustdevicevectorltuint64tgt DVAL  values1     thrustsortbykeyDVEC.begin, DVEC.end, DVAL.begin     HOSTVEC  DVEC     values1  DVAL      QueryPerformanceCounterampstop      duration  doublestop.QuadPart  start.QuadPartdoublefreq.QuadPart     printftfn, duration  codepre  hr  pAnd results in Sp    precodeN               CPUstdsort          GPUthrustsort        1024             0.000078                0.082252 4096             0.000298                0.001878 16 384           0.001362                0.002221 65 536           0.006160                0.003567 262 144          0.027243                0.009838 1 048 576        0.123147                0.028428 4 194 304        0.560742                0.104790 16 777 216       2.416347                0.409492 codepre  pResults when moving the timing to just encapsulate the thrustsortp  precode    QueryPerformanceCounterampstart     thrustsortbykeyDVEC.begin, DVEC.end, DVAL.begin     QueryPerformanceCounterampstop codepre    precode    N               CPUstdsort          GPUthrustsort            1024             0.000078                0.085252     4096             0.000298                0.001086     16 384           0.001362                0.001322     65 536           0.006160                0.002280     262 144          0.027243                0.005820     1 048 576        0.123147                0.020394     4 194 304        0.560742                0.077384     16 777 216       2.416347                0.310128 codepre

Negative 46564 pI have my application that lists out a bunch of products for purchase separated into categories.  When you click on a category, that list of products is then cached using the MVC donut hole cache a hrefhttpsgithub.commoonpykmvcdonutcaching relnofollowplugina.  Now I have a link to have the user enter a secret code so they can view more products.  When I enter that code and click on the categories again, the new products are not coming up because of the cache.  I need to find a way to somehow disable or clear the cache when that code is entered.  Does anyone know how I can do thisp

I am also using the codepromise.donecode method to log codehellocode after every ajax call was a success.p  pI am also specifying that if it is the last iteration, the promise should log the final history object and bind it to the history table.p  pEvery call is success. I can see the output object for every call in the console. I can also see the hello in the log after every promise is resolved.p  pBut the final object which should be logged after everything is logged in the very beginning before any of the ajax calls are made. I am new to promises and I dont understand why. I just want to take the final object and use it in my view by binding it to my table. What am I doing wrong and what can I do to fix itp

Negative 46564 pI have an embedded board connected to my PC. The embedded board is using Silabs CP2200 as the ethernet controller. It has been observed that the ethernet works fine with one CAT5e cable and it stops working with any other usual CAT6 cable.

This doesnt help me conclude how my board is not working with CAT6  and working with CAT5e. Anybody faced similar issue beforep

One of them sells chilli sauces, and one sells different flavours of mayonnaises.,One the mayonnaise one, I have about 30 products setup. Theres nothing really special about how the site is built, it just has the 30 products on there, each around 2.50. On this site, my client would like to do a promotion, so that anyone who places an order over 15 between August 1st and August 31st gets to choose 1 of 4 products on the site for free, so they just need to be able to select one of the four prodducts in order to add it to their cart a price of 0.00.,With the chilli site, there is about 5 products on there, each around 2.99. What my client wants is for between the 1st August and 31st August, all sauces are 2 for 5. So for example, if a visitor buys 2 sauces their total is 5, if they buy 4 its 10, 6 is 15 and so on..,I think this will have to be done through rules, but just thought Id post this to see if anyone can give any pointers on how to do these two promotions as Im getting a little stuck trying to creates rules that can do this.,Thank you so much for reading, and I look forward to any pointers. carlbowles100,20130422,Im running Drupal 7.22 with the Garland theme.

Is there any point in still using it,Am I missing something thumbslinger,20150708,Since its now 2015 and all I find on this is from 20082011, Im hoping some solid ideas have arrived for this.,We are hosting our actual site both the dev and the live site. Im not an IT guy and in the past, this stage was all done so I logged on to the dev.xyz.com, made changes then sshd into dev.xyz.com and ran a script somebody else had made. Renamed a settings.php file and was done.,We had a dev server and a live server but two different databases on the live server. We also had two separate settings.php files abc.settings.php and 123.settings.php each which pointed to one of two different databases abc or 123.,That script,1. dumped the database of dev.xyz.com,2. checked the settings.php file to see which of the two databases was actually in use, then,3. imported the previously dumped database into the other database on the live server but not in use,4. synced.,Then, all I did was to renamed the appropriate settings.php file. So if the settings.php file was originally pointing to the abc database, Id rename 123.settings.php to settings.php. As that database would have had the lates dev db imported into it. Had the original live settings.php been pointing to the 123 database, then Id rename the abc.settings.php to settings.php,But, I dont have that script. So Im looking for the waysmeans to do this. Is it using sqldump Backing up is easy and can be done in a myriad of ways but Im talking about how do I make the connection in what kind of script between a dev server and a live server,Id like to dump the db, import it to the live server and be done.

I have googled possible solutions and Javamail says that we can use SOCKS5p  blockquote   pQ How do I configure JavaMail to work through my proxy server [updated] p      pA JavaMail does not currently support accessing mail servers through a web proxy server. One of the major reasons for using a proxy server is to allow HTTP requests from within a corporate network to pass through a corporate firewall. The firewall will typically block most access to the Internet, but will allow requests from the proxy server to pass through. In addition, a mail server inside the corporate network will perform a similar function for email, accepting messages via SMTP and forwarding them to their ultimate destination on the Internet, and accepting incoming messages and sending them to the appropriate internal mail server.p blockquote  pThat solution is not valid for me, so I have to look for new alternatives.

Negative 46564 pI am working in a CSS environment that is missing CSS3 and much of CSS2 so I cant do flow columns. I have to simulate it with codefloatcodes and correct ordering. I want the order of the items to be the same as they would be in a codecolumncount 3code layout. Like thisp  precodeWe have 6 items, lay them out like this 1   3   5 2   4   6  We have 5 items, lay them out like this 1   3   5 2   4     We have 4 items, lay them out like this 1   3   4 2     We have 3 items, lay them out like this 1   2   3  We have 7 items, lay them out like this 1   4   6 2   5   7 3 codepre  pSo it flows, while also attempting to balance but giving the first column the extra one if its not divisible by number of columns.p  pI am fine with ideas in any programming language I can adapt it for the PHP and JavaScript Im using. p

Negative 46564 pI have a list of fields and associated tables in an Excel worksheet I exported from SQL Server Management Studio SSMS. I only have read access to the database of concern.  I can only write code in VBA.  I think that my access level in SSMS is pretty low only select queries. There is no documentation on the database I am working with.  Id like to provide a sample of data with many fields to the end user so the user can assist me in determining which fields are needed.  p  pIm going to need to create a query with many joins to get the data.  My assumption is that fields with the same name can be linked.  Im looking for an algorithm that will find the joins for me.  It might be beneficial to use some constraints on the algorithm but I dont know what those constraints are now. Is there a similar problem that has been solved that could give me some guidance on how to approach the problem  p
