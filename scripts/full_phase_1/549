Positive 549 pThis seems to be a common issue but I havent found a solution that actually works. Ive tried installing both Lithium and Helium on Ubuntu using the Installation Guide from the wiki. Following this guide the only feature that gets installed is odll2switchswitchui which should also install the DLUX Web Interface. I can access it fine using http8181index.html but I get the Unable to Login error when i try to log in using admin  admin. Ive tried the various fixes that include installing several features in the correct order. And Ive deleted the data directory, then reinstalled the features, but I cannot get it to log in. I am installing on Ubuntu Server, not on Ubuntu Desktop. It seems unlikely that thats causing the issue but its worth noting.p

[general]  The anonaccess and authaccess options control access to the  repository for unauthenticated a.k.a. anonymous users and  authenticated users, respectively.  Valid values are write, read, and none.  Setting the value to none prohibits both reading and writing  read allows readonly access, and write allows complete   readwrite access to the repository.  The sample settings below are the defaults and specify that anonymous  users have readonly access to the repository, while authenticated  users have read and write access to the repository. anonaccess  none authaccess  write  The passworddb option controls the location of the password  database file.  Unless you specify a path starting with a ,  the files location is relative to the directory containing  this configuration file.  If SASL is enabled see below, this file will NOT be used.  Uncomment the line below to use the default password file. passworddb  passwd  The authzdb option controls the location of the authorization  rules for pathbased access control.  Unless you specify a path  starting with a , the files location is relative to the  directory containing this file.  The specified path may be a  repository relative URL  or an absolute file URL to a text  file in a Subversion repository.  If you dont specify an authzdb,  no pathbased access control is done.

The specified path  may be a repository relative URL  or an absolute file URL to a  text file in a Subversion repository.  groupsdb  groups  This option specifies the authentication realm of the repository.

Negative 549 pWeve been using Drip to try and identify why pages with UpdatePanels in them tend to use a lot of clientside memory.  With a page with a regular postback, we are seeing 0 leaks detected by Drip.  However, when we add an update panel to the mix, every single DOM object that is inside of the update panel appears to leak according to Drip.p  pI am not certain is Drip is reliable enough to report these kinds of things  the reported leaks do seem to indicate Drip is modifying the page slightly.  p  pDoes anyone have any experience with this  Should I panic and stop using Microsoft Ajax  Im not above doubting Microsoft, but it seems fishy to me that it could be emthisem bad.p  pAlso, if you know of a tool that is better than Drip, that would be helpful as well.p
Negative 549 pOur design has one jvm that is a jbosswebapp readwrite that is used to maintain the data via hibernate using jpa to the db. The model has 1015 persistent classes with 35 levels of depth in the relationships.p  pWe then have a separate jvm that is the server using this data.  As it is running continuously we just have one long db session read only.  p  pThere is currently no intrajvm cache involved  so we manually signal one jvm from the other.p  pNow when the webapp changes some data, it signals the server to reload the changed data.  What we have found is that we need to tell hibernate to purge the data and then reload it.  Just doing a fetchmerge with the db does not do the job  mainly in respect of the objects several layers down the hierarchy.  p  pAny thoughts on whether there is anything fundamentally wrong with this design or if anyone is doing this and has had better luck with working with hibernate on the reloads.p  pThanks, Chrisp
Negative 549 pIm currently looking to perform some headless HTML rendering to essentially create resources off screen and persist the result as an image.  The purpose is to take a subset of the HTML language and apply it to small screen devices like PocketPCs because our users know HTML and the transition from Photoshop to HTML markup would be acceptable.p  pI am also considering using WPF Imaging so if anyone can weigh in comments about its use particularly tools you would point your users to for creating WPF layouts you can convert into images and how well it performs it would be appreciated.p  pMy order of preference isp  ol liopen sourceli lihigh performanceli linative C or C wrapperli lilowest complexity for implementation on Windowsli ol  pIm not very worried about how feature rich the headless rendering is since we wont make big use of JavaScript, Flash, nor other embedded objects aside from images.  Id be fine with anything that uses IE, Firefox, webkit, or even a custom rendering implementation so long as its implementation is close to standards compliant.p

Negative 549 pI am creating a department picker form that is going to serve as a modal popup form with many of my primary forms of a Winforms application. Ideally the user is going to click on an icon next to a text box that will pop up the form, they will select the department they need, and when they click OK, the dialog will close and I will have the value selected for me to update the textbox with.p  pIve already done the route with passing the owner of the dialog box into the dialog form and having the OK button click event do the proper update, but this forces me to do a DirectCast to the form type and I can then only reuse the picker on the current form.p  pI have been able to use a ByRef variable in the constructor and successfully update a value, but it works only in the constructor.

Negative 549 pWe have an application that will be collecting data and storing it in local WinXP PCs using Microsoft SQL Server Compact.

My total render size is of 91537 bytes, 44483 of which are dedicated to that specific form. My viewstate seems kindof enormous. Also Can a 404 to a JS file cause that kind of lag on loadp  p[update] So I found the longestrunning query, and it seems that even though it DOES seem quite chunky, it has ended running long before the page is even loaded. As added information I am using quite a bit of SqlDataSources troughout the controls, to fill my dropdownlists and other interesting stuff of the like. Is that cluttering my appp

Negative 549 pI am creating a CMS and am using serialize to handle publish and rollback, which seems to work fine.  Basically, The normal site tables are what gets displayed and anything not displayed is serialized in a separate table.  The problem however is in making the Preview functions work.  p  pSince the front end is created using normal SQL calls, and all the prepublishedrolled back data is in a separate table it would mean updating every sql statement with some fancy code to pull the version correct to the preview.  It will also get especially problematic with things like limits etc and would be a nightmare for the front end.p  pThe only other approach I can see is a separate databasetables for the preview copy, but many people may be using the preview function and I am loathe to create a duplicate database for every person using preview as it will very quickly get out of hand.p  pIs there any way of doing this that will allow preview, and rollback preview, but will not require much from the code that displays the contents of the database and also avoid the problem of mass duplicationp

Similarly if they click on the txtPrdAC or txtHowMany, any information that was present in the ddl list is cleared and the return back to its original, default value.p  pI would like to do this in c code behind and have so far got the following code that is working...ish Well, it sets the focus of the radio button anyway.p  precode ddlProd.Attributes.Addonchange, return SetRadioFocus                                      radBuyer.ClientID       radTopx.Attributes.Addonclick, return SetRadioFocus                                      radTopx.SelectedItem       tbxProdAC.Attributes.Addonclick, return SetRadioFocus                                      radProd.ClientID        ClientScript.RegisterClientScriptBlockthis.GetType, MyScript,               function SetRadioFocustarget                                               document.getElementByIdtarget.checked  true           , true codepre  pHowever, I am still missing certain aspects i.e. the cleainr the text boxes and or ddl.

Negative 549 pMy end goal is to get Erlang syntax highlighting in QsciScintilla using PyQt4 and Python 2.6. Im running on Windows 7, but will also need Ubuntu support.p  pPyQt4 is missing the necessary wrapper code for the Erlang lexerhighlighter that base scintilla has, so I figured Id write a lightweight one on top of QsciLexerCustom. Its a little bit problematic, because the Qsci wrapper seems to really want to talk about lineindex rather than offsetfromstart when gettingsetting subranges of text. Meanwhile, the lexer gets arguments as offsetfromstart. For now, I get a copy of the entire text, and split that up as appropriate.p  pI have the following lexer, and I apply it with setLexer. It gets all the appropriate calls when I open a new file and sets this as the lexer, and prints a bunch of appropriate lines based on what its doing... but there is no styling in the document.

Negative 549 pIm one of those that recently decided to migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL and with it a lot of old habits are being torn apart. However there is functionality from MySQL I would like to preserve in PostgreSQL.p  pSo...  strongtopicsstrongp  ol liUser should have ability to create tables under a restricted namespace.li liTables of one user should not be visible to other users by default both data, structure, stored procedures and whatnot.li liOptionally the user should be given the right to GRANT permissions to other users.li liDefault permission to new users is to have no permission read nothing, write even lessli liMaintain compatibility with applications that are not schema aware.li ol  pstrongPoint 1strongp  pUnder MySQL the solution in place was to allow the user to create databases under the criteria username. Under PostgreSQL I thought of having one database per user such that they can create as many schemas as they want. However there is the limitation of not being able to do joins across databases, only across schemas on the same database.p  pThe possibility of having all as PostgreSQL schemas under the same database is not completely discarded. But then it suffers from the next point...p  pstrongPoint 2strongp  pAfter reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1487678postgresschemaisolation titlePostgres SCHEMA isolationthis questiona I was inclined to think that the only way to make data completely private was to use different databases. Still I cant seem to figure out how to do it and on the other hand it conflicts with the ability to do the joins mentioned in the previous point.p  pstrongPoint 3strongp  pIs this even possible or do you need the Create roles privilege and create a new role for the given tableschema.p  pstrongPoint 4strongp  pAgain, is this possible From what I read it feels like Im fighting the default public behavior, but still I would like to have the users seeing nothing unless an admin gives them access to the information.p  pstrongPoint 5strongp  pSome of the programs I use with MySQL, on which I have no direct control of the actions they perform on the database, are not schema aware. This means they simply ignore the schema layer. For this PostgreSQL provides the public schema as default. However this is still a bit awkward in some cases.p  pIt also means that by default I need one independent database per softwaretool or else I need to trick the system by setting a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs8.4interactiveddlschemas.htmlDDLSCHEMASPATH relnofollow titleThe Schema Search Pathsearchpatha to some predefined schema on a per user role basis.p  hr  pSo those are the optionssolutions Ive found so far.

Negative 549 pI have a complicated problem with a couple of SWFLoaders.p  pI have an application that loads a swf with a SWFLoader. The loaded swf loads another swf just a compiled fla. I am adding all my resize and position logic in my loaded swf and it works good on event resize, but when Im trying to run the same code in my swfs applicationComplete it fails. The same code on startup works great if I run my swf as a standanlone, but for some reason the scale is different when I load it into my application.p  pIm just setting its width and height to the browsers size so everything but the scale is the samep  pThis is my trace from my loaded swf as a standalone swfLoader 1435 742 FlexLoader 1319.1 742 1.0305555555555554 1.0305555555555554p  pand this is from the same loaded swf when its loaded in my application swfLoader 1435 742 FlexLoader 1159.55 742 0.9053196681307955 0.9053196681307955p  pswfLoader is my loaded swfs swfloader that loads my compiled fla. That is what I need to resize and position to the center. The next numbers are width and height. FlexLoader is the swfLoaders loader or content if you will. The numbers are width, height, scaleX and scaleY.p  pAs you can see the size is the same this is also the same for the loaded swfs application, but the scale is different. Both scales are calculated from with 1280 and height 720 wich is my compiled flas size.p  pThe only reason why Im messing around with scale at all is that I cant find the accurate width of my compiled fla to center it application.width  loadedSwf.width  2 So if anybody knows a better way to find that I would appreciate that to very much p  pThe part Im not getting is why the scales are different What part am I missing I am completely lost and been trying to solve this for quite some time now p p
Negative 549 pIve been stuck for hours trying to render a Core Animation layer tree into an OpenGL context using CARenderer.

The CARenderer does come alive in fact, if l1 is already attached to another context at the time this code runs, it will dutifully complain. Theres just no visible output, ever.p  pOther things Ive tried wrapping the CARenderer code in a CATransaction, fiddling with the NSOpenGLView setup options in Interface Builder, rendering the whole affair into a manually created OpenGL context offscreen and saving that into an image file... all to the same effect native OpenGL commands show fine, CARenderer shows nothing.p  pI suspect that theres something wrong with the way my OpenGL context is set up, or that I might even somehow be rendering outside of my viewport... probably some really stupid minor detail. Unfortunately, both documentation and sample code for CARenderer on the web is somewhat sparse, and while Im fairly experienced with Core Animation, my OpenGL knowledge is decidedly limited.p  pSo right now, Im seriously stumped and completely out of ideas, so any pointers are greatly appreciatedp  pCheersp

Negative 549 pI am trying to write a shell language parser in Boost.Spirit. However, I am unclear about some basic issues regarding semantics of coderulecodes.p  pLooking at the documentation, there are members coder.aliascode and coder.copycode of coderulecode. IIUC, these members should return a reference to the rule and a copy of the rules contents, respectively. However, it is not clearly specified what happens when I just use the rule in a definition of another rule. From my experiments, I found mutually recursive rules can be defined byp  precoderuleltItergt r1, r2 r1  ... gtgt r2 gtgt ... r2  ... gtgt r1 gtgt ... codepre  pwhich suggests the rules are taken by reference inside parser expressions. The problem is, what does it do when the variable goes out of scope, egp  precoderuleltItergt r1     ruleltItergt r2   r1  ... gtgt r2 gtgt ...   r2  ... gtgt r1 gtgt ...  ...  use r1 codepre  pOn the same note, would assigning to a rule from a parsing expression containing a rvalue of type rule work coder.copycode would be a rvalue of type coderulecode too, isnt it eg.p  precoderuleltItergt f  return chara ltlt charb  ruleltItergt r1  ... ltlt f codepre  pCan anybody enlighten me on the detailed semantics of coderulecodes copies and references, and possibly correct any misconceptions in this postp

Negative 549 pVB.NET, VS 2010, .NET 4p  pHello,p  pIve written an application.  Ive discovered that it is full of circular references.  I would like to rewrite portions of my code to improve its design.  I have read about tiered programming and want to implement something like it for my application.p  pBackground  My application is a control program for an industrial machine.  It parses a recipe from an Excel file which contains timing information and setpoints for the various attached devices.  There are three main types of devices  Most are connected through Beckhoff terminals and communicate via TwinCAT Beckhoffs pseudoPLC software and two are RS232 devices, each with a different communication protocol.  I can communicate with the Beckhoff devices via a .NET API provided by Beckhoff.  I have written parser classes for the two RS232 devices.  Some of the Beckhoff devices are inputs, some are outputs some are digital, some are pseudoanalog.p  pI think my problem is that I was trying to wrap my head around OOP while writing the application so I created classes willynilly without a clear idea of their hierarchy.  At some points, I tried to do what I thought was right by, say, making a Device class which was inherited by, say, a TwinCatDevice class and a Rs232Device class.  But then I just stuffed all of the communication code in those classes.p  pWhat Im trying now is creating some communication modules e.g., UtilTwinCat, UtilRs232 that contain abstract methods like Connect, Disconnect, Read, Write, etc.  Then Im trying to rewrite my Device class and subclasses to use these modules so they dont have to contain any of the sometimes redundant communication code.p  pHeres my question  Would it be good design to create separate classes for each type of communication type  i.e., should I have, say, TwinCatReadOnlyDigital, TwinCatReadOnlyAnalog, TwinCatWriteOnlyDigital, TwinCatWriteOnlyAnalog, TwinCatReadWriteDigital, TwinCatReadWriteAnalog, Rs232ReadOnlyDigital, etc  Or perhaps some interfaces like IReadOnly, IWriteOnly, IDuplexp  pThis seems like it cant be the right approach in that I imagine someone who is good at programming wouldnt end up with a billion different classes for every eventuality.  Is there some way I could selectively implement an interface on a class at run time  I think thats a stupid question...  Im still trying to wrap my head around why one would use an interface.  Im looking for some basic insight on how to grapple with this type of design problem.  Specifically, if you have a lot of things that differ slightly, is the best approach to create lots of classes that differ slightlyp  pThanks a lot in advance, Brianp  pEdit I just wanted to add, to be clear, there is a finite number of devices whose parameters are known, so it would be straightforward to write classes for all the types Id need. I just wonder if theres a better approach.p

Again, Im trying to keep from duplicating a lot of info only to change one or two settings if I can help it. DebugRelease seems very clean as it is, and I want to make sure I change things along the proper axis. Measure twice, cut once, as they say.p  pClues welcomeappreciatedp

Here is the code p  precodeNodeltTgt f NodeltTgt t NodeltTgt subRoot NodeltTgt root  Only works with trees of depth 2.  private NodeltTgt TreeListltTgt prefixBank, int maxDepth      if prefixBank.Count  0              if maxDepth  0                      t  new NodeltTgtprefixBank[0]             subRoot.Addt              prefixBank.RemoveprefixBank[0]                  else                      if root  null                              root  new NodeltTgtprefixBank[0]                 prefixBank.RemoveprefixBank[0]                 TreeprefixBank, maxDepth  1                           f  new NodeltTgtprefixBank[0]              if isOperatorf                              root.Addf                 prefixBank.RemoveprefixBank[0]                 subRoot  f                           for int i  0 i lt 2 i                              TreeprefixBank, maxDepth  1                            return f  codepre  pThe above function takes a list of characters that form a prefix mathematical expression for example code  3 4  5 6code.

I am using a slightly modified version of the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms37957228vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowbinary tree class found on MSDNa. I modified it to have an add function that automatically added to either the left or right subtree so I dont have to specify Root.Left.Left.Left etc like this example does to create the tree. p  pIf any body could help me correct my recursive tree creation code so that it works for trees of n depth I would really appreciate it. Im relatively new to C so I apologise if anything above is slightly sketchy. p

Negative 549 pIm currently trying to edit a website for a client which uses Adobe Contribute so it uses a different stylesheet if the user is browsing from a mobile phone. The mobile phone stylesheet is much simpler and strips out background images and styles to reduce load time. I understand it would be better practice to have a completely seperate website for the mobile, but this is not practical for the client as he needs to be able to update his websites content using Contribute.p  pThis is working in some devices already such as the iPhone last time I tested but on my Android phone I have a strange problem. When I visit the URL or click on a link, it displays the website using the default stylesheet. If I refresh the page it then decides to show the site rendered with the mobile stylesheet.

Negative 549 pIm programmatically reading emails from Exchange 2010 that have been sent in plain text. In my parsing tests to ensure the email is valid I do a series of validations, one being checking the beginning text codeStartsWithcode precisely. When I manually copy and paste the email from Exchange into Visual Studio 2008 the start of the email looks like codern x0002rncode. I believe codex0002code is a smiley face STX judging from my research. However, programatically retrieving the email from Exchange as well as viewing it in Outlook the codex0002code character displays as a codecode. Ideally, I would like to parse whats retrieved from Exchange codern rncode and convert it to codern x0002rncode.p  pFor what its worth, ReSharper is the one who converted the original string to include codex0002code.p  pIs this possiblep

Negative 549 pIm trying to figure out a way to divide the UI from the business logic. In addition, I want the business logic to be able to notify the UI of updates easily without having to pass a reference to a form all over the business logic or something like that. I found the ApplicationContext class and it seems like it would allow me to store all forms and threads in a higher level class. It just seems odd that the main form contains handles to different threads and other forms. Is it appropriate to put all of this in ApplicationContext I was thinking about making it a singleton as well so that the business logic can easily notify the UI. Thanksp

Negative 549 pApparently you can create services that are run with Twisteds twistd in two different ways. On the one hand you can create services using the a hrefhttptwistedmatrix.comdocumentscurrentcorehowtoapplication.htmlTwisted Application Infrastructurea and in the other you can create a service using the a hrefhttptwistedmatrix.comdocumentscurrentcorehowtoplugin.htmlTwisted Plugin Systema. It seems like besides some differences in how you start the the app on the command line, and the means by which you write the actual service, they are two ways to accomplish the same thingp

Negative 549 pToday, trying to DRY up some code, I extracted some duplicate File.exists code used by several helper methods into a private method p  pcodedef templateexiststemplatecode and accidently monkey patched this already existing Rails helper method. This was a pretty clear indicator of a code smell, I didnt need need any the inherited methods, yet I inherit them. Besides, what was my refactored method doing in this helper at allp  pSo, this helper does way too much and hence violates SRP Single Responsibility Principle. I feel that rails helpers are inherently difficult to keep within SRP. The helper Im looking at is a superclass helper of other helpers, counting 300 lines itself. It is part of a very complex form using javascript to master the interaction flow. The methods in the fat helper are short and neat, so its not that awful, but without a doubt, it needs separation of concerns.p  pHow should I go forth p  ol liSeparate the methods into many helpersli liExtracting the code inside the helpers methods into classes and delegate to them Would you scope these classes i.e. MydomainTemplateFinderli liSeparate the logic into modules and list them as includes at the topli liother approachesli ol  pAs I see, no 2 is safer wrt accidential monkeypatching.

Negative 549 pLong story short, I am developing a simple game, and I have a codeGamecode object that keeps track of the current game state, as well as some additional things that are usefulrequired later on.  One of these is a reference to the codeUIViewControllercode that loaded the game, which is simply declared as a property on the objectp  precodeinterface Game  NSObject      ivars   property nonatomic, retain myViewController viewController codepre  pThe getterssetters for this property are generated using codesynthesize viewControllercode, and all seems well.  p  pNow there are only two paths through which this property is accessed, when the game is won and when the game is lost.  The game is lost path works fine.  The game is won path is causing a bizarre error in which the value of the codeviewControllercode pointer seems to get overwritten with garbage.  p  pIn order to figure out what is going on, I overrode the getters and setters as followsp  precode myViewController viewController      NSLogGetting     return viewController    void setViewControllermyViewControllercontroller      NSLogSetting     viewController  controller  codepre  p...and set breakpoints inside I know Im not retaining the view controller is my setter, but that is not the issue the view controller remains on the stack and does not actually need to be retained by codeGamecode.  Here is what I got in GDBp  precodefirst call to setter po controller ltmyViewController 0x9208130gt  call to getter on the game is lost path gdb po viewController ltmyViewController 0x9208130gt  call to setter, starting a new game from the same view controller gdb po controller ltmyViewController 0x9208130gt  call to getter on the game is lost path gdb po viewController 0xbea2222c does not appear to point to a valid object. gdb print viewController 1  myViewController  0xbea2222c codepre  pSo at some point, the value of the pointer was changed from code0x9208130code to code0xbea2222ccode, but I cant figure out where.  There is no code that assigns into the codeviewControllercode property or its backing ivar apart from the call to the setter at the start of the game.  Yet clearly something is overwriting the value with garbage on the game is won path.p  pIs this possibly a buffer overrun issue  If so what is a good approach for tracking it downp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI added a second pointer as an ivar in another class that I set to the value of codegame.viewControllercode at the start of play, and using this pointer for the game is won path works.  So it appears to me that something is trashing the original pointer.  Still no idea what, however.p

Negative 549 pok so, the title of this question might be a little confusing, and i will try to explain it to you i have a php file with an array containing multiple form fields like thisp  precodevar  array0 gt ltinput type....gt, 1gt ltinput type....gt codepre  pand i created a while loop to loop through the array to show them in a table, something like thisp  precodeecho lttablegt   whilerow  mysqlfetcharrayresult     num  row[fieldId]     field  num. .row[field]     echo lttrgtlttdgt.field.lttdgt     echo lttdgt.var[q].lttdgtlttrgt     echo lttrgtlttdgtampnbsplttdgtlttrgt     q    echo lttablegt codepre  pi included this php file in a html file so i can get a table with two columns, the first one with field from the database and the second with var[q] which is some input field taken from the var array.  Believe it or not that actually works, now the problem is that inside that var array i have a codeltselectgtcode field with multiple options, i want to validate that field with some javascript, but for some reason i cant get the values assigned in codeltoption valueSOMEVALUEgtcode . i dont know why but i cant, one thing i found weird is that in that var array i have some radio buttons which i strongCANstrong validate with javascript.p  pstrongmore infostrong the html file that includes the php file has thisp  precodelthtmlgt.... ltform namemainFormgt   ltphp     include myPhpFile.php   gt   ltinput typebutton namebtnNext onclickfunctionToValidategt ltformgt ...lthtmlgt codepre  pso basically when i include my php file it creates a table and adds fields to it filling them with data from a mysql database and some input fields using the var array shown above all that works, but the problem is when i click the next button it calls a javascript function to validate the fields, everything works until it gets to the codeltselectgtcode input, i can validate radio buttons, text fields and textareas but i cant validate those codeltselectgtcodep  pthis is the javascript function i am usingp  precodefunction myFunctionNameHere ifdocument.mainForm.p11[0].checked ampamp document.mainForm.p11[1].checked       alert1  some warning here     else ifdocument.mainForm.p12[0].checked ampamp document.mainForm.p12[1].checked       alert2  some warning here     else ifdocument.mainForm.p13[0].checked ampamp document.mainForm.p13[1].checked       alert3  some warning here     else ifdocument.mainForm.p14[0].checked ampamp document.mainForm.p14[1].checked       alert4  some warning here     else ifdocument.mainForm.p15[0].checked ampamp document.mainForm.p15[1].checked       alert5  some warning here     else ifdocument.mainForm.p16[0].checked ampamp document.mainForm.p16[1].checked       alert6  some warning here     else ifdocument.mainForm.p17.value         alert7  some warning here      this condition does not work     else ifdocument.mainForm.p18.selectedIndex  0       alert8  some warning here     cant get the selectd field from the html select field     else       window.location  OTHERPAGE.html  codepre  pthats pretty much what the function does, all conditions work except for that one i put the comments on. im still learning so dont laugh at my code... please.p  pstrongSorry i actually got this solved, there were some errors in the html code from my php array.

Negative 549 pI am used to programming in Delphi. In that system, a hardware floating point exception, e.g. division by zero, overflow, etc. results in a native Delphi exception being raised. The mechanism is that the hardware exception are not masked and those hardware exceptions are converted, by the Delphi RTL, into native Delphi exceptions.p  pMy app has a plugin architecture and many of my clients write plugins using the MS C compiler. When a floating point error occurs in the clients C plugin code this jumps out of the C code and into an exception handler in my Delphi code. This makes it difficult for the plugin author to diagnose where in their code the problem is because, so far as I can tell, they cannot trap these exceptions since they are not C exceptions.p  pIs there any way that I can set some option in the C code to make the C compiler convert floating point exceptions into C exceptions Or do I have to mask the exceptions in the C code and test for errors manuallyp  pAnd as an aside, how does one go about writing robust scientific and numerical code if the standard C tools ignore floating point errors It seems like a glaring weakness, or am I missing somethingp

Negative 549 pFor my Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures class, my professor asked us to pick any topic that interested us. He also told us to research it and to try and implement a solution in it. I chose Neural Networks because its something that Ive wanted to learn for a long time. p  pIve been able to implement an AND, OR, and XOR using a neural network whose neurons use a step function for the activator. After that I tried to implement a backpropagating neural network that learns to recognize the XOR operator using a sigmoid function as the activator. I was able to get this to work 90 of the time by using a 331 network 1 bias at the input and hidden layer, with weights initialized randomly. At other times it seems to get stuck in what I think is a local minima, but I am not sure Ive asked questions on this before and people have told me that there shouldnt be a local minima.p  pThe 90 of the time it was working, I was consistently presenting my inputs in this order code[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 0]code with the expected output set to code[0, 1, 1, 0]code. When I present the values in the same order consistently, the network eventually learns the pattern. It actually doesnt matter in what order I send it in, as long as it is the exact same order for each epoch.p  pI then implemented a randomization of the training set, and so this time the order of inputs is sufficiently randomized. Ive noticed now that my neural network gets stuck and the errors are decreasing, but at a very small rate which is getting smaller at each epoch. After a while, the errors start oscillating around a value so the error stops decreasing.p  pIm a novice at this topic and everything I know so far is selftaught reading tutorials, papers, etc.. Why does the order of presentation of inputs change the behavior of my network Is it because the change in error is consistent from one input to the next because the ordering is consistent, which makes it easy for the network to learn p  pWhat can I do to fix this Im going over my backpropagation algorithm to make sure Ive implemented it right currently it is implemented with a learning rate and a momentum. Im considering looking at other enhancements like an adaptive learningrate. However, the XOR network is often portrayed as a very simple network and so Im thinking that I shouldnt need to use a sophisticated backpropagation algorithm. p

Negative 549 pI am facing problem with LWUIT browser in conjunction with Facebook OAuth API. p  pI am trying to authorize our application to use Facebook services on a mobile client using LWUIT browser, which is available on SVN. I can go as far as the permissions page where you see a list of permissions followed by the Allow and deny buttons. The moment I click on the Allow button, I am again being redirected to Facebook login page m.facebook.com instead of forwarding to our application webpage. Has anyone encountered this problem and has managed to get around itp  pFrom my understanding, I believe there is a problem in parsing the page and hence there is a failure in generating an access code which in turn is responsible for forwarding back to the application webpage.p  pId really appreciate if anyone could shed some light on the predicament.p  pThanksp
Negative 549 pI am trying to import a shared library which contains a number of Python wrappers for a visualisation program a hrefhttpswci.llnl.govcodesvisit relnofollowVisIta to be specific. This library is implemented in such a way that one first imports the library, which makes a few functions available, and then you call a function which launches the visualisaion viewer and makes the rest of the API available to call. For example, in the followingp  precodeform visit import  print dir Launch print dir codepre  pthe first print statement contains the usual builtins and a couple of other functionsp  precode[AddArgument, GetDebugLevel, Launch, SetDebugLevel, builtins, doc, file, name, package, warningregistry] codepre  pand the second print yieldsp  precode[ActivateDatabase, AddArgument, AddColorTable, AddOperator, AddPlot, ... ] codepre  petc.p  pI wish to instead call codeLaunchcode within a function so I can process and pass arguments to codeLaunchcode. However, when I do this the functions which are made available after the call to codeLaunchcode are not in the global namespace, but in the namespace local to the function. So in the following examplep  precodeimport sys from visit import   def main      Launch     print dir     if Version in dir         print Version  This is made available by call to Launch above      return 0  if namemain     ret  main     print dir     sys.exitret codepre  pthe codeprintcode statement within codemaincode will printp  precode[ActivateDatabase, AddArgument, AddColorTable, AddOperator, AddPlot, ... ] codepre  pas above, whereas the codeprintcode just after codemaincode is called prints p  precode[AddArgument, GetDebugLevel, Launch, SetDebugLevel, builtins, doc, file, name, package, warningregistry] codepre  pas if codeLaunchcode was never called.p  pMy first question is how do I ensure that the global namespace is populated by the call to codeLaunchcodep  pSecondly, the call to codeVersioncode actually fails, with the errorp  blockquote   pNameError global name Version is not definedp blockquote  peven though codeprint Version in dircode returns codeTruecode. Will this problem be resolved if I solve my first problem, or is this something else entirelyp  pPlease let me know if you need more information above the shared library. I dont know a lot about how it is written but I can try and find out.p  pstrongEditstrong Following the answer by voithos the following is the solution I have adopted. p  pAs stated by voithos, Visit uses a dynamic import which brings everything to local scope... assuming that youll never call codevisit.Launchcode outside of the global scope. His initial answer allows me to make the functions made available by codevisit.Launchcode to be used outside and in of my main routine, using the prefix codevisit.code with all these routines.p  pTo import the VisIt routines as codefrom visit import code, so that they may be called without the codevisit.code prefix I modify voithos use of codesetattrcode in codemaincode to the followingp  precode Loop through the local namespace and add the names that were just  imported to the module namespace loc  locals for key in loc     setattrsys.modules[name], key, loc[key] codepre  pthen the VisIt routines are available at the module level and all seems well.p  pThanks to voithos for your answer.p

If it exists, I simply return it.  If the object is not in cache, a sproc call is made to the database to look up this data. Once the sproc returns, this data is added to cache and then returned.p  pUnder heavy load I have a bit of a performance issue that Id like to clear up.brp  pbHeres my scenariobp  ol liUser A comes into this method.li liData is not in cache, sproc gets called. li liUser B comes into this methodwhile sproc is still running.li liData is not in cache, sproc gets called.li liRinse and repeat over and over.li ol  pUnder heavy load, these can generate quite a lot of concurrent and redundant active spids.  Im trying to figure out the best way around this.  Obviously I could drop in an spgetAppLock but the requests would still end up 1 dropping into the sproc and 2 have to fire the exact same query.  I could lock on an object that is specific to that exact query and have that wrapped around the cache check.  But if I do that, Im potentially opening the door for some massive thread contention and deadlocking.p  pI have to assume that someone has dealt with this very scenario before and Im hopeful there is an appropriate solution.  Right now the best solution I can come up with is application locking, but Id really like to know if anyone has any better options. Perhaps a combination of things, say sql app locks and messagingtraditional or non traditional where after the lock succeeds, any that were just released try to pull down the resultsetfrom where as opposed to reexecuting the entire rest of the sproc.  p  pbEDITbbr So follow this.... If I lock or wait either the caching or the sproc call, under heavy load its possible that if an element is not cached and the methodor sproc that generates the tobecached object could end up taking longer than expected.  While that is spinning away, threads are going to have to wait.  By waiting, the only wayat least that I know is to lock or spin.brbr Isnt it then possible to have thread pool exhaustion or lock up all available requests and force the requests to be queued This is my fear and the thing that drove me to look into moving the layer away from the application and into the database.  The last time we attempted to lock around the caching, we suffered from severe CPU spikes on our web box because the threads sat in a lock state for so long.  Though I believe at the time we did not use Monitor.EnterMonitor.Exitor just lock.  Either way, does anyone have any details or experience in this area  I know its typically bad form to lock on long running processes for this very reason.  I would suffer loading duplicate content into cache if I could avoid preventing user requests from dropping into the request queue because Im all out of threads or all active requests are locked. brbr Or, maybe its just late and Im over thinking this.  I had started my day with an almost brilliant, ahha moment.  But now I just keep second guessing myself.p

Negative 549 pA problem appears when two users are logged on to our service system at the same time and looking at the service list gridview. If user1 does a search to filter the gridview and user2 happens to click to another page user2 sees the results from the search performed by user1. That means one company can see another companys data.p  pIts an ASP.NET application that was developed in house with CASP.NET 3.5. The data is stored in a SQL 2000 database and relies very heavily on stored procedures to update, select, and delete data. There are multiple user types that are restricted to what data they can see. For example, we have a company use that can only see data relavant to that company. p  pFrom what Ive seen, the security is handled through If statements in the front end. Example, if userlevel  1 then do this, if userlevel  2 do this. These statments are used to show or hide columns in a grid, run queries to return data, and any other restrictions needed. For a company user the code behind gets the companyid assigned to the user and uses that in a query to return the results of all the data associated with that companyid services, ships, etc. p  pAny recommendations for fixing this will be highly appreciated.p

Negative 549 pI have a library containing some Azure helper classes. Inside these helper classes I obtain settings such as the Azure account name and key. When running in Azure these settings are picked up from the cloud configuration file cscfg. This all works fine.p  pIn order to unit test these classes outside of Azure specifically the RoleEnvironment I created settings of the same variable names within the unit test project. These actually get saved within an app.config file and are edited via the settings section which lives under the properties section of my test project. Rather than create my own method of abstracting the cloud configuration settings from web.configapp.config settings I decided to use the CloudConfigurationManager class. However, when I run my unit tests none of my settings are picked up so I simply get nulls. If however, I change my app.config file to use settings in the appSettings format below, then I do get valid values. The downside of this is I can no longer edit my settings using the settings editor page within visual studio. p  pSo my question is am I doing something wrong or is this a limitation of the cloud configuration manager, whereby it can only pick up manually added appSettings but not applicationSettings added using the editorp  precodeltappSettingsgt     ltadd keyFoo valueMySettingValuegt ltappSettingsgt codepre  pthe above works, whereas the below does notp  precodeltapplicationSettingsgt     ltComponentsTest.Properties.Settingsgt       ltsetting nameFoo serializeAsStringgt         ltvaluegtMySettingValueltvaluegt       ltsettinggt     ltComponentsTest.Properties.Settingsgt   ltapplicationSettingsgt codepre
Negative 549 pI just spent the better part of a day finding a bug caused by a stray comma at the end of an assignment statement. The difficulty in finding my bug was exacerbated by a thirdparty callback library that was trapping exceptions but it made me wonder why Python 2.x doesnt raise a syntax error instead of creating a tuple.  Consider the followingp  precodegtgtgt a  1, gtgtgt a 1, codepre  pAs you can see, the trailing comma creates a singleton tuple.  Its not a violation of the Python grammar see a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgreferenceexpressions.htmlgrammartokenexpressionlist relnofollowhttpdocs.python.orgreferenceexpressions.htmlgrammartokenexpressionlista but it can certainly lead to some unexpected results, e.g. p  precodegtgtgt a  1, False, codepre  pvsp  precodegtgtgt 1,  a True codepre  pAlthough I now understand whats going on, Im puzzled about why Python permits this syntax instead of requiring explicit parentheses to create a tuple. strongIs there some case where this behavior is necessary, or at least advantageousstrong  Ive been programming almost exclusively in Python for the past 7 years and Ive never needed to create a singleton this way. Python is, in most respects, a wonderfully readable and explicit language. This particular feature seems, well, unPythonic.  p

The second option is quicker and easier, but less secure.p  pThe other factor here is that this would be a singlepage app using GWT, and certain sections of the UI will be able to accept payment and will require the secure transmission of financial data. So some AJAX requests emcouldem be HTTP, but others emmustem be HTTPS.p  pSo I askp  ul liGAE has a nifty table explaining incomingoutgoing bandwidth resources, but never concretely defines how much IO bandwidth can be dedicated for HTTPS. Does anybody know the restrictions here Im planning on using Billing Enabled and paying a little bit for the app and for higher resource limits.li liIs it possible to have a GWTsinglepage app where some portions of the UI use HTTP while others utilize HTTPS Or is it all or nothingli liIs there any emrealem performance overheard to utilizing an allHTTPS strategyli ul  pUnderstanding these will help me decide between a HTTPS hybrid solution, or a pure HTTPS solution.

Negative 549 pI have some RGBA data in Python 3 and I want to display the image it represents in a GTK3 window without using any extra libraries.p  pFirst thing I tried was editing a codePixbufcodes data as in an example httpdeveloper.gnome.orggdkpixbufstablegdkpixbufTheGdkPixbufStructure.htmlputpixel  sorry, Im only allowed 2 links in the C documentation, using codePixbuf.getpixelscode.  This gives me an immutable codebytescode object, though, and so obviously wont work.  A gdkpixbuf bug report 668084, would link to it if SO would let me covers the same function, but stuff mustve changed a bit since.p  pNext, I tried creating a Pixbuf from the data using a hrefhttpdeveloper.gnome.orggdkpixbufstablegdkpixbufImageDatainMemory.htmlgdkpixbufnewfromdatacodePixbuf.newfromdatacodea, but this is buggy too see gdkpixbuf bug 674691 yes, thats me in comment 3.p  pThen I looked at Cairo a hrefhttpcairographics.orgdocumentationpycairo3referencesurfaces.htmlcairo.ImageSurface.createfordatacodeImageSurface.createfordatacodea should do this, but for some reason this isnt available in the Python 3 binding yet.  I have tried this with Python 2, turning the surface into a codePixbufcode afterwards and then wrapping that in a codegtk.Imagecode, and it works.  But Im using Python3 and even then, its messy  Cairo is a vector graphics library, after all.p  pI found a reference somewhere to using PIL to write the image out to a PNG file then reading that into a Pixbuf, but this is horrible, uses an extra library, and PIL isnt available for Python 3 anyway.p  pSo...any other methodsp  h2Working codeh2  pBased on Havoks answer, heres a working examplep  precodefrom array import array  from gi.repository import Gtk as gtk, GdkPixbuf  pixels  arrayH for i in range20     for j in range20         px  i lt 10, j gt 10, i lt 10  j lt 10         pixels.extend65535  c for c in px  header  bP6 20 20 65535  imgdata  header  pixels  w  gtk.Window w.connectdeleteevent, gtk.mainquit l  GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader.newwithtypepnm l.writeimgdata w.addgtk.Image.newfrompixbufl.getpixbuf l.close w.showall gtk.main codepre  pEdit actually, for correctness, I think this will need a codepixels.byteswapcode on littleendian systems before adding to the header though of course it doesnt matter with these colours.p

Negative 549 pI have been creating and consuming web services for years and always have been able to use Visual Studio to create a service reference from the client. I have a third party service I need to work with and they refuse to open their security so I can see the wsdl and make the service reference. Its a public facing service so I dont see the need for that level of security but it is what it is.p  pI know this is a n00b question and Im ashamed to be asking it, but how do I do create the equivalent Service Reference information in my client when all I have available to me is a physical copy of the wsdl the client emailed me The web.config changes, the object layer over the SOAP data, etc. Just like with an automated Service Reference I just want to open a connection to the service and start using it with the defined objects.p  pThe third party service is not WCF as far as I can tell but is SOAP.

Negative 549 pIm not exactly well versed with Telerik or even silverlight but I do have a question about something. Lets say I have a grid view for uploading images for an account. So I log in, upload the images and they are stored in an object with the Account name they were uploaded for, then the ItemSource is binded to this object and the Account they were uploaded for is displayed.p  pSo lets say my name is John and I manage 3 accounts, Bears, Tigers, and Wolves, and Im uploading images for 2 of them. I log in, select Bears and upload 3 images. They are sent to the database with their file information and stored in the database like file name, type, uploading user, time and date etc, account its for etc, and the object has the list of images uploaded along with the account name Bears then the gridView.ItemSource is set to the object and it populates one row in the gridView and it just says Bears. Then I repeat the process but this time for Wolves, and when the gridView is binded the second time, there are 2 records in the gridView. Bears and Wolves. Next to each object is a little  sign, would it be possible so when the user clicks the  sign, to display the images uploaded for the accountp  pIm not exactly sure how templates work with silverlight or telerik controls but is this possible so if i uploaded files for Bears called, bears1.jpg, bears2.jpg and bears3.jpg, and i click on the  sign by the Bears item in the gridview, it drops down and shows the 3 file names p  pMore info just in casep  pI think basically what I want to do is create a simple GridView so when the images are uploaded, in the background I have an object called Upload with the account it was uploaded for BearsWolves....etc, who uploaded it, and a list ObservableCollection or the image objects which has the file name, image type, size, upload date etc. So when I am done uploaded, then I set the gridview.ItemSource  uploadObject, and I want the sub rowhierarchicalchild gridView rows to be generated off of the uploadObject.Images list. How can I do thatp
Negative 549 pContext p  pI designed an embedded system and I ported Android Gingerbread to run on it. I use an ARM CortexA8 based CPU module that has the CPU, SDRAM, NANDFLASH on it and all the rest available on module pins so I can add my own hardware interfaces. The first one came with uboot preinstalled. All I had to do to install my Gingerbread was to place the 4 images kernel.img, system.img, ramdiskyaffs.img and userdata.img in a directory sdfuse on the SDCARD and just burn it to the onboard NANDFLASH using command sdfuse flash kernel kernel.img and the equivalent commands for the other 3 files. Simple enough. After that, I use the SDCARD in Android as an external storage. Life was goodp  pThe Problemp  pNow I bought more modules and they did not come with uboot preloaded. So, I need to make a bootable SDcard with uboot on it. It needs to be FAT in order to be recognized by my processor at boot time. I actually have a SDHC 4GB card in FAT32, successfully installed Uboot and it boots my system up to the uboot prompt telling me it cant find the 4 image files. Its expected since the images are not there yet. The problem is now I cant create the sdfuse folder and put the 4 image files on it. Neither my MACBook nor my Ubuntu machine let me mount that SDcard anymore to create the sdfuse folder on it. Both diskmanagers see the SDCard but neither allow to mount it. Obviously, I missed something somewhere. What I have now is a bootable 4GB FAT32 SDCard with Uboot on it but the rest of the card is not usable anymore. Anybody knows what the problem could be Why cant I use this 4GB bootable FAT32 partition to install my sdfuse folder with the images I used a Ubuntu machine to create the bootable SDCard so, the USBSDCard reader is working well, in other words, the problem is not hatdware but some software configurations of some sort.p  pEDIT following Chris Stratton comment about file system I have an SD Card containing the sdfuse with the 4 image files kernel.img etc and a bunch of other file and folders. With Ubuntu Diskutility, I can see it as one partition W95 FAT32 LBA 0x0c Master Boot Record. I can readwrite just about anything on it from Ubuntu and MacOSX. The second SDCard that I made is also seen has one FAT32 partition Master Boot Record, type W95 FAT32 LBA 0X0c but I cant mount it neither from Ubuntu but seen under devsdb nor MacOSX. That last one, is the one with uboot on it. Just strange  Just to work around the problem, I just had an idea so I can keep working, I just tried to boot with the uboot SDCard then, I changed the SDCard live for the one with the 4 files. I used the command sdfuse to flash uboot, kernel, android etc to my NANDFLASH device. Then, when I force a reboot from NAND, it boots into Android. It is OK for development but this is way too complicated for a production procedure.  Chris Stratton is probably right when he points to a filesystem partition or structure. I just did not figure it out yet.

Negative 549 pI want to generate a list of codencode probabilities with the sum of probabilities amounting to 1. The list is of fixed size, but could be arbitrarily large. So codencode could be code111code, code2code, code10code, code14code, code100code, etc. I realize that this might be a computational challenge of sorts and there might not be one best way of doing this but I would  still gladly appreciate suggestions for a reasonable approach.p
Negative 549 pThis comes after 3 days of researching and writing code. I have EF Code First  EF5 and a generic repository pattern built on top of it.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwNNY8.jpg altInfrastructurep  pNow I have codeICustomerRepositoryltCustomergt  IRepository and  CustomerRepository  RepositoryBaseltMyContextgt , ICustomerRepositorycode. So when I go about testing this I find that I have to write A FakeDbContext , A Fake IDbSet and then Fake the data as well and do a lot more as well. All this when I know that I am going to test Linq to Objects with my in memory data and Linq to Entities will require another suite of tests in the form of integration tests. So, either my code structure is wrong and thus writing unit tests is so difficult or there is a better way to write tests that I am unaware of or I should just have Integration Tests. I am using NUnit and MOQ.p  pEdit  What is it that I am trying to test  I am trying to check methods like GetCustomersByType , Add , GetOrderPlacedByCustomer . Trying to see if the logic inside those methods is correct. This what unit test are for , I guess.p

Negative 549 pI think the title is quite straightforward but basically I have 2 mysql tables that hold various information. Linking them together is a unique id.p  pOne of the tables is showing a total of 2 rows less than the other. I would like to run through these rows and find out which id values are missing. I do not know enough of mysql to say that this is not possible using only mysql but i thought it would be an easier task with php.p  pso something like this which really is a thumbsuck p  precodeif stmt  linkgtprepare     SELECT i.id AS itemsId, c.itemid AS catsId     FROM items i     INNER JOIN itemcategories c     WHERE i.id  c.itemid       stmtgtexecute     stmtgtbindresultid1, id2     stmtgtclose  while stmtgtfetch      run through the numbers and echo which numbers are missing out of 1 to 300.  codepre  pWould anyone have any idea on how i could accomplish something like thisp  pAny advice, suggestion or information would be greatly appreciated, thank youp

Negative 549 pMy site has many pages. Pages are created for different topics and moderated by users for example a page for emPirates of the Caribbeanem or a page for Justin Bieber. The page belongs to a category, for example, Movies or Music. The default URL to a page is a hrefhttpwww.example.comcategorydirectorypageid relnofollowhttpwww.example.comcategorydirectorypageida. Optionally, if the moderator wants to establish their own link for a page as an easier means of navigation, they can do so by giving value to the Page.link column for example a hrefhttpwww.example.compotc relnofollowhttpwww.example.compotca for the movie emPirates of the Caribbeanem.p  pI have my routes all set up which took some time in itself. The route checks to see if the first parameter of the URL after .com matches the link column of any page, if it does, route to that page and the controllersactions under it. If not, route as usual.p  pWhen a user is viewing either a hrefhttpwww.example.compotcarticles99 relnofollowhttpwww.example.compotcarticles99a or a hrefhttpwww.example.commovies106articles99 relnofollowhttpwww.example.commovies106articles99a given that emPirates of the Caribbeanem is page with id  106 then the user is directed to the articles controller, view action, id  99. 106 is passed as pageid to the controllers action and also set in the AppController.p  pThe URL array Im providing in the controller works fine for example if the id does not exist I redirect to codecontroller gt articles, action gt index, pageid  pageidcode. I am redirected back to a hrefhttpwww.example.compotcarticles relnofollowhttpwww.example.compotcarticlesa. I dont actually have to define the controller since by default it uses the current controller.p  pHowever, Im having an issue with the pagination links. Say for example Im on the articles index page and there are 100 articles but Im only viewing the first 20. I would like the URL to be outputted as a hrefhttpwww.example.compotcarticlespage2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.compotcarticlespage2a. p  pInstead, if I set the URL array as codecontroller gt articles, action gt index, pageid gt pageidcode similar to what I did in the controller I get the link a hrefhttpwww.example.comarticlespageid106page2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comarticlespageid106page2a I can understand why this route does not work because I probably have to pass along the value Page.link if it exists and if not pass along Category.directory and Page.id. Ive tried doing the latter option using the URL array codecontroller gt articles, action gt index, category gt page[Category][directory], pageid gt pageidcode. I have a route to match this but the pagination links are still generated as a hrefhttpwww.example.comarticlescategorymoviespageid106page2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comarticlescategorymoviespageid106page2ap  pHere are some snippets from my routes.php a hrefhttpsgist.github.com9ba0a54a7f4d68803d14 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com9ba0a54a7f4d68803d14ap  pMy question is strongCan I use the exact current URL for pagination links minus reference to current page I am onstrong For example, if Im viewing a hrefhttpwww.example.comdynamicroutecontrolleridpage2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comdynamicroutecontrolleridpage2a, the pagination link will automatically go to a hrefhttpwww.example.comdynamicroutecontrolleridpage3 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comdynamicroutecontrolleridpage3ap  pI put all of my pagination code into an element and I would like to include the element in my view file wherever the pagination is needed.p  pRight now, if Im viewing the articles controller, index action, the default URL for the pagination links is a hrefhttpwww.example.comarticlespage2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comarticlespage2a, but I need it to be a hrefhttpwww.example.comdynamicroutearticlespage2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comdynamicroutearticlespage2ap  pI tried using the p  precode   thisgtPaginatorgtoptions  array                     url gt httpwww.example.comdynamicroutearticles      codepre  pBut the link is output like a hrefhttpwww.example.comarticleshttpwww.example.comdynamicroutearticlespage2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comarticleshttpwww.example.comdynamicroutearticlespage2ap  pstrongEditstrong Jeztah, you mention putting p  blockquote   pcustomlink    [az09]1[az09]2,[az09]1p blockquote  pin my route. Well I cant simply do this because the route does a query to check to see if the customlink is in the database and if so routes accordingly.p  pAn example of my router file isp  pafter getting first param of url which would be a hrefhttpwww.domain.com relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comastrongCUSTOMLINKstrong, do the followingp  precodeifparam1  users ampamp param1     pagelink  strreplace,  , param1      pagesModel  ClassRegistryinitPage     matchedpage  pagesModelgtfindfirst, array         conditions gt arrayPage.link LIKE gt pagelink, recursive gt 1           ifmatchedpage[Page][id]         Routerconnect . param1 . controller, arrayaction gt index, pageid gt matchedpage[Page][id], array             pass gt arraypageid,             pageid gt [09],             persist gt arraypageid,                   Routerconnect . param1 . controlleractionid, arraypageid gt matchedpage[Page][id], array             pass gt arraypageid, id,             pageid gt [09],             persist gt arraypageid,                    Routerconnect . param1 . controllerid, arrayaction gt view, pageid gt matchedpage[Page][id], array             pass gt arraypageid, id,             pageid gt [09],             id gt [09],             persist gt arraypageid,                    Routerconnect . param1 . controlleraction, arraypageid gt matchedpage[Page][id], array             pass gt arraypageid,             pageid gt [09],             persist gt arraypageid,                 end if page matches   end if param1 is not users codepre  pIf I go to a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticles relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticlesa, a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticles1 relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticles1a, a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticlesedit1 relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticlesedit1a, etc the proper page is display. If I try to navigate to a page where the customlink does not exist, continue down my router file and if no other route is matched then throw error message. All good there.p  pIn my ArticlesController.php the redirect method works as expected. Say for example, I try to go to a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticles99 relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticles99a but id 99 does not exist, I am properly redirected back to a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticles relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticlesa using p  blockquote   pthisredirectarrayaction  index, pageid  pageid,   null, truep blockquote  pHowever, on the pagination, I set the url options as p  blockquote   parraycontroller  articles, action  index, pageid    pageidp blockquote  pwhere pageid is set in the AppController from being passed by the Router. Though I dont need to set controller and action because the current will be used. Again, my pagination links appear as a hrefhttpwww.domain.comarticlespageid3page2 relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comarticlespageid3page2a and not what I want which is a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticlespage2 relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticlespage2ap  pstrongEditstrong Jeztahp  pI just changed my entire route file to what you had with having a customlink parameter I renamed to link and then created a component for use in the app controller to get the page id from the link.p  pExample routep  precodeRouterconnectlinkcontrolleractionid, array, array     pass gt arraylink, id,     link gt [az09]1[az09]2,[az09]1,     persist gt arraylink,    Routerconnectlinkcontrollerid, arrayaction gt view, array     pass gt arraylink, id,     link gt [az09]1[az09]2,[az09]1,     id gt [09],     persist gt arraylink,  codepre  pHowever, paginating with the url array as codearraylink gt testexamplecode the url is outputted as codehttpwww.domain.comarticleslinktestexamplepage2code. My code is exactly as yours minus renaming customlink to link. Also, now my route cant differentiate between whether Im trying to access a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlink relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinka which would be controller  pages, action  view his page would basically use the News model and display the latest news for the page and if Im trying to access a hrefhttpwww.domain.comarticles relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comarticlesa which would be controller  articles, action  index which would display the latest articles for ALL pages. Note, articles and news are separate models.p  precodeRouterconnectlink, arraycontroller gt pages, action gt view, array     pass gt arraylink,     link gt [az09]1[az09]2,[az09]1,     persist gt arraylink,  codepre  pis the same as p  precodeRouterconnectcontroller, arrayaction gt index codepre  pbecause the check to see whether or not link belongs to a specific page is no longer done in the route.p  pstrongEditstrong Ok Im making progress. I found out that next and previous pagination links dont take to the paginatoroptions very well. I deleted the paginatoroptions and left the url array of the next button empty. The link was outputted as a hrefhttpwww.domain.comarticlescustomlinkarticlespage2 relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comarticlescustomlinkarticlespage2a.

Negative 549 pI currently have an Android application that has an intentfilter to receive images from the Gallery. It is important that the images are received in the same order that the user selected them in. This seems to be the default behavior on most devices, however on some devices so far Ive seen this on Motorolas running Android 4.x the order seems undefined.

They choose to Share them with my app. My application receives a list of Uris which are then displayed using an internal gallery  backed by a custom Adapter class. The images display correctly based on the Uri list, strongthe issue is the order of the ListltUrigt is sometimes incorrectstrong. It is important to my users that the images appear in the same order they select them in. p  pstrongClarificationstrong When I use the term Gallery I am referring to the built in Android app Gallery.  When I use the term Share I am referring to the the Share button within the Gallery app. This allows the user to select from a list of services such as Facebook, Email, and in this case my app. p  pFor Example imagine a Gallery with 3 images, displayed in an arbitrary order A, B, and C. The user selects first C then A then B and chooses to share them with my app. On most phones my list will be correctly ordered C, A, B, on offending phones this order seems random. p  pI cannot use the creation timestamp because the creation time is generally irrelevant to the selection order. Adding custom meta data doesnt help either because I dont know the correct initial order.  p

Negative 549 pI have a couple scripts to clean up some generated HTML a python script using BeautifulSoup, and a Ruby script.

Negative 549 pI am currently developing an Android application to communicate with Nfca 14443 type A cards but when I am touching my Samsung Galaxy S II plus to an empty nfca card, it looks like the tag keeps on disconnecting and reconnecting to my device even with no application open and after a short time it crashes the NFC on the smartphone meaning i cant read any kind of tags.p  pThis problem does not occur on a Samsung Galaxy S III which is able to correctly connect to the tag and communicate with it successfully.

Negative 549 pIm building a custom CMS system that will store articles.p  pWhat is the correct way to store the article in the db Given that an article may consist of a single paragraph or any number of paragraphs and may contain images it doesnt seem practical to store each paragraph in a distinct field of the db. p  pI have looked at how Wordpress stores posts and it seems to lump the raw html in a single field postcontent. Is this an accepted method The disadvantage I see with this method is that for each article any html markup is also stored. If I only stored the raw text then the dynamic page which displsys the article would only contain the html markup just once. But then how to derentiate between paragrpahs and imagesp  pAny thoughtsp  pThank you.p
Negative 549 pim looking for an elegant way to make a model method call. Here is my queryp  precodewhereorderid  , argument.first codepre  pI cant use this query in a scope, because of the first method, which is chained after the where method.p  pSo I tried to create the following class methodp  precode  def self.findordervalue     whereorderid  , value.first   end codepre  pWhen I use this method twice in my controller action, I get a warning from my IDE, that I should move this query into a scope. When I rename the method without find in the beginning, I also get a warning in my controller, that I shouldnt call more than one method besides find or new I have a another model method calling in this controller action. I know, it isnt a real problem because it works, but Im interested in writing nice and dry code. I hope it isnt an annoying question, I should fairly say that Im relatively new to programming.

Negative 549 pMy app works fine, but Im not sure if its considered bad practice with what Im doing for a particular knockout.js form.p  pIm using CakePHP as the backend and knockout.js for a form on one of my views. On this view, the JavaScript file for the Knockout.js form containing the MVVM goodies is included. So, this knockout form accesses the JS script, and one of the functions involves this JS script sending a request out to a different PHP file. Right now this file is just in the root directory of my folder not in the app directory, and since its strongonly interacting with the JavasScript directly and not CakePHPstrong Im wondering if this is a nono. I guess you could think of it as this PHP file is interacting with the Knockout system and not the CakePHP system.p  pI made this file a while back to do some calculations and it just seems easier to leave it this way considering I dont need a view or anything displayed from it. JSON format data is sent to it, and it sends modified data back to JavaScript in JSON format. Basically this php file only interacts with JavaScript and never with the CakePHP structure. p

Negative 549 pI am having difficulty inserting the geolocated coordinates latitude and longitude of the current users location into a PHPMySQL generated xml file. It requires the users geolocation to correctly generate the 20 closest businesses within a 30mile radius. I am currently using a jQuerypowered store locator script to generate the map. The script works fine with a static URL as the xmlLocation, but when I try to use variables in the URL it just outputs an strongundefinedstrong alert message. My aim is to get javascript to place the latitude and longitude values of the users location into the PHP GET variables so that the XML generator can generate correct output. It looks like thisp  pstrongLocationGlobal  datagendefaultmap.phplat  lat  amplng  lon  ampradius30strongp  pAnd should ouput something like this p  pstrongdatagendefaultmap.phplat34.383747amplng82.364574ampradius30strongp  pI have made modifications to the script and placed comments accordingly.

Negative 549 pI am currently refactoring a webapp. Right now there is a Contact table that has a onetoone correspondence with the main Client table, with a bool indicating if clients want to receive mail. The maillist is accessed about once per month, and the clients profile page is accessed many times a day. I am thinking if it would be cleaner to make a new table with the client ids of everyone in the maillist, as querying if the key is in the table should take about the same time as accessing the information. Should I do that, or should I leave it as it isp  pThanks, Joycep

And also, I have found that if I call codeAuthorizecode in every call made to Twitter, that an unhandled exception is thrown if I repeat the call enough times.p  pIt seems quite important that I am able to know if auth is authorized before I make the call to Twitter.

Negative 549 pI want to run a function on an interval, inside of a Task.

However both of these would cause an additional thread to spawn the Elapsed events occur on a new threadpool thread. So for every repeating task, there would be 2 threads instead of 1. The Task is already asynchronous so Id prefer not to complicate things in this way. p  pYet another way that behaves similarly is to use ManualResetEvent, p  precode    ManualResetEvent m  new ManualResetEventfalse      void sleepint milliseconds              m.WaitOnemilliseconds       codepre  pSince m.Set would never be called, this would always wait for the right amount of time, and also be single threaded. Does this have any significant advantage over Thread.Sleepp  pWondering what the best practice would be here. p  pThoughts p

Not in the header but inside where all the content is. p  phere is my query that works perfectly wellp  precode    ltsquarespacequery collectionfeaturearticles limit10gt    ltligt     .repeated section items         ltligtlta hreffullUrlgttitleltagtltligt     .end   ltligt  ltsquarespacequerygt codepre  pCan the data be inserted into a code block via the content manager so I can then insert into within the content or am i totally wrong in thinking that. p  pWhat i will then do is style add or edit the UI of the data into either a carousel or whatever is needed for the project. p  pI just need to know where to store the query so that it fits in with the content.p  pAppreciate any time. thanks.p

Negative 549 pI am having a problem understanding the best practises for creating classes and subclasses of them using inheritance.p  pLets say, I want to implement 3 type of users in my projectp  pAdmin, User and Contactp  ol lipstrongContactstrong This is a user with fullname, email, telephone, and other contact details created by Admin or User and they CANNOT login to the system. Imagine they are only members of the private phonebook of each user.pli lipstrongUserstrong This is a user again with fullname, email, telephone, and other contact details which can be created by Admins. They can create Contacts but NOT other Users, and they CAN login to the system. They also can and should be members of the Admins Phonebook.pli lipstrongAdminstrong This is a user again with fullname, email, telephone, and other contact details. They can create Users andor Contacts and of cource they can login to the system To keep things simple, lets say that these users are to be created through the submittion of a web formpli ol  pThe simplified attributes for them arep  pstrongContactstrong email, telephone, city, ownerid, dateinp  pstrongUserstrong email, telephone, city, ownerid, password, dateinp  pstrongAdminstrong email, telephone, city, password, dateinp  pthe database table users is something likep  ul liid autoincrementli liownerid ID of the user by whom this user was createdli lifullname textli liemail textli liphone textli licity textli liusertype Contact  User  Adminli lidatein datetime they signed upli lipassword if applicableli ul  pI an not sure wow I should use the inheritance... Is the following scheme correctp  precodeclass Contact   class User extends Contact   class Admin extends User  codepre  pSome other problems There should be a method in Admin and User that can create new users lets name it createuser. But each of them, should do different checks and allow for different options, and insert different type of things to the Database. What is the best practice to do so Write a generic to the parent class and call it through the subclasses and then update the entry from the subclasses with the extra data eg the Admins should also store the password to the databasep  pstrongUPDATEstrong maybe I was not clear enough...p  pThere is going to be PLENTY of common methods, irrelevant to the type of the user, and this is why I want inheritance. I also want a common db table.p  pMy main problem here, is how to implement common methods that need to de different stuff... For example, this is the usercreate for class Userp  precodefunction usercreateemail, telephone   dbqueryinsert into users ....   return insertid  codepre  pI wonder if it would be nice practice to implement the same method for Admin like thisp  precodefunction usercreateemail, telephone, usertype, password   newid  parentusercreateemail, telephone   if usertype  User     queryUPDATE users SET typeUser, passwordpassword WHERE idnewid      return newid  codepre

Negative 549 pIm wondering what the best approach in AngularJS is to secure admin pages, i.e. pages that normal users shouldnt be able to see. Obviously, there will be backend authentication but since the AngularJS app is clientside, people could still theoretically look at the routing and go to those URLs directly and look at the admin pages.p  pIm using Express, PassportJS amp MongoDB Mongoose as my backend. Naturally, they wouldnt be able to interact with the admin pages since there is serverside authentication on creation, deletion, ... but Id much prefer to not even serve the pages to the user if they do not have the proper access. Since the app is fully clientside JS though, Im thinking this is kind of impossible since people can just modify the routing and whatnot. Whats the best way to go about this Thanks for any inputp
Negative 549 pI am having an issue trying to update a drawing that uses a number of different drawing objects.  The drawing is similar to an AutoCad drawing and is measured in mm so the scale is already being calculated in order to get the drawing to fit on the stage.  When this is calculated the scale is set to one.p  pI have the drawing objects lines, circles, arcs, etc. stored in an array.  I am trying to update the drawing andd rescale it without clearing the stage and doing a full redraw to improve performance.p  pWhat I am trying to do is to increment the length of the drawing.  The drawing has a cut point so the objects to the right of the cut point will move by the increment value and any lines that span the cut point will increase in length.  This change will require an update to the scale initially calculated to get the drawing to appear on the stage.p  pThere are 2 Fiddles that I have set up to demonstrate the problem.  The first a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nettctruckscience3HxuP4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nettctruckscience3HxuP4a shows what I am currently doing.  The problem is that drawing will scale but it will start to move away from the right hand side of the screen.  p  precodeoriginalRectWidth  2600 rectWidth  rectWidth  20     scaleValue  originalRectWidth  rectWidth  oldRectWidth  rect.getWidth newPixelsPerScaleUnit  260  rectWidth  newRectScaled  rectWidth  newPixelsPerScaleUnit drawingGroup.setWidthnewRectScaled rect.setWidthnewRectScaled drawingGroup.scaleByscaleValue codepre  pAlso, if I make a lot of increments and then make a large decrement using a text box there is an issue in the redraw.  It that lines are not decremented correctly.  I think it is an issue with the scaling.  When I resize the page, which calls a refresh of the drawing objects from the array in which they are held, the drawing proportions are correctp  pThe second Fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nettctrucksciencersEyA15 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nettctrucksciencersEyA15a shows how I would like the drawing to behave.p  precodeoldWidth  drawingGroup.getWidth newWidth  drawingGroup.getWidth  20 scaleValue  originalWidth  newWidth codepre  pIs there a way to do thisp

For the sake of brevity, Im including only 3. I do not control this schema, nor can I request changes to it.p  pIts a simple, even trivial matter to aggregate all of this data in objects and serialize out to XML based on this schema. But when dealing with such large amounts of data, out of memory exceptions occur while using this strategy.p  pThe strategy that is working for me is this Im populating a collection of entities through an ObjectContext that hits a view in a SQL Server database a most ineffectively indexed database at that. Im grouping this collection then iterating through, then grouping the next level then iterating through that until I get to the highest level element. I then organize the data into objects that reflect the schema effectively just mapping and setting the sequential coderecordIdentifiercode Ive considered doing this in SQL, but the amount of nested joins or CTEs would be ridiculous considering that the identifier spans the header elements into the child elements. I write a higher level element say the codelevel2Elementcode with its children to the output file.

Negative 549 pIs it possible to store void type methods in an arrayList or can you only store methods that have a return value I want to call any one of up to 15 methods and rather than writep  precodeifvar  1     method1 else ifvar 2     method2  codepre  petc...p  pby the time you surround with trycatch and a few more lines of code that repeat for each one it would be much neater if you could dop  precodearrayList.getvar or something similar codepre  pHowever my methods just do stuff as opposed to return a value so if the methods themselves cannot be stored in an array is there somewhere else they can be stored together and extracted with a for loop or by just using the var integerp
Negative 549 pI would like to get the fontsize for an html element in a web page, for example a codeltpgtcode tag. This should be valid even for element without a codestylecode or codeclasscode attribute, so it has to know dynamically inherited css attributes.p  pIve tried with html agilitypack, a very good lib, but of course it doesnt consider css rendering. Tried also with WPF webbrowser, but it seems it cannot get font size for every element, and for many of them it returns a percentage.p  pJavascript codegetComputedStylecode is not suitable since all should run server side.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 549 pIm working on internationalization and I was wondering if there is a way to change a threads locale using MFC with C. The reason is that some countries can have a short date format of ddMMMyyyy and I want to be able to detect that in our application and then modify the threads locale to something like ddMMyyyy instead of using ddMMMyyyy.p  pLet me explain more of what Im trying to do. I know that I can format individual dates. My goal is to modify locale info for short date format for all  threads in my MFC application. Ive already done this in a ASP.NET web app with C by using CurrentThread and setting its CurrentCulture to a new CultureInfo object that Ive cloned and modified so that the short date format is different. Im just wondering if something similar can be done but instead using MFC and C.p  pThanks p

Negative 549 pThe new Future in Scala 2.10 uses an execution context for every operation where an action is called asynchronously including codemapcode, codefiltercode, etc. Does this mean that every action will always be called individually through the execution context, or is it possible that this step is optimized away when chaining multiple transformationsfilters each using the same execution contextp  pI.e. if doing codef.map....filter....map...code, all with the same execution context, will this call codeexecutecode once because its clever enough to compose a synchronous function from the above, or three timesp  pIf the scala future does not do the above optimization, is there an alternative framework better suited for long chained compositions that does do the abovep

Negative 549 pIn my case, I have groups of records and when I update one of them, I need to update the rest of the records of the group. So to ensure that I update all of them and I need to ensure that no other records are added to the group when I am updating one record of the group. Also I need to ensure that a record of the group is not removed in the middle of the process because then I update a record that really isnt belong to the group.p  pSo I am thinking in the possibility to block a record just when it is read. a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comeseslibraryms173763.aspx relnofollowIn the documenationa I see the the more restrictive isolation is the serializable isolation, but I have a doubt because it saysp  blockquote   pStatements cannot read data that has been modified but not yet committed by other transactions.p blockquote  pOther statement cant read the record if it modified and not committed, but can be read if still is not modified, so I can get unupdated information that I need to decide what related records I need to update.p  pSo I would like to know if it is another way to block records just when it is read. I know that with the hints I can block a table when I execute a statement, but block all the table. The process that I need to execute its very fast, but I would like to avoid the need to block all the table and block only the records that I need.p

Negative 549 pIm building a cordova app primarily for IOS amp Android in which the user can take an image, retake , etc. it and save it locally.p  pIm currently struggling with the cordova cameraPlugin. So, here a short description of the problem.p  pWhen the user takes an image, its saved locally in the apps temp folder and the user is able to view in in the UIWebView. On retaking, the image will be deleted from the temp folder and should not be available any longer in RAM and local FS. It works as long as the user doesnt retakes the image 2 or more times, if he does instead of the last image the first image will be referencedrendered in WebView. After reopening the app, the image is displayed correctly.p  pAn Examplep  ol liThe user takes the first image.  cdvphoto001.pngli liThe second.  cdvphoto002.png and the first one will be deleted which seems to work correctlyli liAnd the third.  cdvphoto001.png and the second image will be deleted.li ol  pThe third image will look the same as the strongdeletedstrong first one. This happens with every image after the third one. strongIt works fine after restarting the appstrongp  pIve already tried to disable the AppCache, delete the app cache before updating the image, refreshing the page and looking for answers online.p  pIm getting an error when opening the camera UI, but I could not find a solution for it either. p  blockquote   pemSnapshotting a view that has not been rendered results in an empty snapshot.

Negative 549 pFirst of all, I have googled and searched on SO for this question. None of the answers Ive seen are really satisfactory for me. I am aware of resolve amp manually bootstrapping angular and neither are great solutions for us.p  pEssentially our app is constructed such that at the top level, we have a p  precodeltbody ngcontrollerapplicationControllergt codepre  pthat instantiates a bunch of stuff. Part of that is getting some data from our server and setting it so that children controllers have access to it. So the issue is sometimes the children controllers are executed before the server has responded.p  pWe use angular UIs uirouter so we can take advantage of states. However resolve hasnt been a great solution for us because we have a bunch of routes and a user can enter the app from any of them. So far my only solutions are to create a very high level parent state and putting a resolve on that, or putting a resolve a multitude of states. Is there a way to make the ajax call before the angular controllers are runp

Negative 549 pI want to run asynchronous uploads with a progress bar in WPF and preferably use PCL for code reuse in Xamarin and SL too.p  pIve been trying to use System.Net.HttpClient. Unfortunately, PutAsync doesnt provide any progress notifications. I know that it does for Windows.Web.Http.HttpClient, but thats not available for WPF, nor in the PCL.p  pFor downloading, its fairly easy to implement your own progress bar, as described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20661652progressbarwithhttpclientherea. You just pass the ResponseHeadersRead option, which makes the stream available as soon as the headers are returned, and then you read it in chunk by chunk, incrementing your progress bar as you go. But for uploading, this technique doesnt work  you need to pass all your upload data into PutAsync in one go, so theres no chance to increment your counter. p  pIve also wondered about using HttpClient.SendAsync instead. Id hoped I could just treat this like an asynchronous HttpWebRequest in which you can increment the counter as you write to the HttpWebRequest.GetRequestStream as described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8181114uploadinghttpprogresstrackingherea. But unfortunately HttpClient.SendAsync doesnt give you writeable stream, so that doesnt work.p  pSo does HttpClient support uploads with a nonblocked UI and a progress bar It seems like a modest need. Or is there another class I should be using Thanks very much.p

Negative 549 pOur system has many tables that require partitioning to support data maintenance. Lets talk about one table to simplify the question. If the data in a table hits 100GB, then the OLTP system starts to slow down. We recommend to customers to move the data from the OLTP system to the OLAP system. We use partitioning by year or month based on data insertion rates to facilitate this move.p  pHere is a sample of a table definitionp  precodecreate table myPartionedTable    objectid        number ,   objecttype      varchar218,   RETIREDTIMESTAMP   timestamp      partition by range RETIREDTIMESTAMP  partition WM2010 values less thanTODATE01012011,MMDDYYYY, partition WM2011 values less thanTODATE01012012,MMDDYYYY, partition WM2012 values less thanTODATE01012013,MMDDYYYY, partition WM2013 values less thanTODATE01012014,MMDDYYYY, partition WM2014 values less thanTODATE01012015,MMDDYYYY, partition WMACTIVE values less thanMAXVALUE  tablespace MYDATE codepre  pThe important point is that the data needs to be retained in the WMACTIVE partition till the data is deemed RETIRED. Once retired, the data moves to the appropriate partition and is then eligible for PARTITIONMOVE out of OLTP and into OLAP.p  pIs this a good approach Is there a better approach for managing this list of requirementsp

However, after testing out a few of the features, I noticed the UI sequence is broken in one particular situationp  pThe installer browses for a file on the clients machine and if the file is found, a dialog called CustomDirDataFound pops up. Otherwise if the file is not found, a CustomDirData dialog is shown. No matter what happens in these dialogs, the next dialog to pop up when next is clicked should be CustomNewInstall.p  pBoth these dialogs move to the correct CustomNewInstall dialog with the MSI I compiled in Visual Studio. However, in the WixEdit MSI, only CustomDirDataFound will go to CustomNewInstall when next is pressed.

Integration Services is not a version upgrade from DTS. Therefore, there are no software conflicts between DTS and Integration Services. You can do the following proceduresp  precodeInstall both DTS and Integration Services on the same server.  Run both DTS and Integration Services packages on the same server. Even if the SQL Server 2000 tools are not present on the server, you can run DTS packages by using the updated version of the DTS runtime that is installed with Integration Services.  Save DTS packages in the msdb database of an instance of SQL Server 2000, or an instance that is running SQL Server 2005 or a later version. However, you can save SQL Server 2008 Integration Services packages only on an instance that is running SQL Server 2008.  Use an optional download of the DTS Designer to modify DTS packages even if the SQL Server 2000 tools are not present on the computer. However, you cannot open or modify DTS packages directly in Business Intelligence Development Studio. NoteNote  For information about how to download the updated version of the DTS Designer, see the section, Installing Designtime Support for SQL Server 2000 DTS Packages. codepre  pWhen you upgrade an existing instance of SQL Server to SQL Server 2008, the system tables for example, sysdtspackages that DTS uses in the msdb database remain intact. DTS packages are not automatically migrated. For information about how to migrate packages, see the section, Migrating DTS packages.p  pArrow icon used with Back to Top linkBack to the top of this section Managing SQL Server 2000 DTS Packagesp  pAfter you install the optional runtime support for DTS as described in the section, Installing runtime support for DTS packages, you can manage DTS packages from SQL Server Management Studio. These DTS packages can be stored in an instance of SQL Server 2000, or imported to and stored in an instance that is running SQL Server 2005 or a later version. Important noteImportantp  pFor important information about how to secure DTS packages, see Securing DTS Packages Stored in SQL Server.p  pTo view DTS packages in Management Studio, first connect to an instance of SQL Server. Do not connect to an instance of Integration Services. Then, in the Object Browser under the ManagementLegacyData Transformation Services node, you will be able to perform the following tasksp  precodeWhen you select the Data Transformation Services node in Management Studio, you can view and open packages, import them to SQL Server from structured storage files, or start the DTS Package Migration Wizard.  When you select an individual DTS package in Management Studio, you can open the package to modify it, migrate it, export it to a structured storage file, or delete it. NoteNote  To open or modify DTS packages, a separate download of the DTS designer components is required. See the section, Installing Designtime Support for SQL Server 2000 DTS Packages. DTS packages cannot be opened or modified directly in BI Development Studio. codepre  pThe Integration Services databaselevel roles grant rights on the Integration Services system tables in the msdb database, but not on the DTS system tables, such as sysdtspackages in the msdb database. You have to grant users rights on the DTS system tables before they can perform certain management tasks, such as importing a DTS package in Management Studio.

You have to install this runtime support before you can run and manage DTS packages. For information about how to install runtime support for DTS, see How to Install Support for Data Transformation Services Packages.p  pThe backward compatibility files that provide runtime support for DTS packages also include runtime support for the SQL Server 2000 Analysis Services Processing task and its dependency, Decision Support Objects DSO. However, the backward compatibility files do not include designtime support for modifying DTS packages that contain the SQL Server 2000 Analysis Services Processing task. You can modify packages that contain this task only when you have SQL Server 2000 Analysis Services installed on the same computer.p  pThe backward compatibility files that provide runtime support for DTS packages do not include support for the SQL Server 2000 Data Mining Prediction Query task.p  pArrow icon used with Back to Top linkBack to the top of this section Running SQL Server 2000 DTS Packages at the Command Promptp  pYou can run DTS packages at the command prompt.

In addition, neither SQL Server 2008, nor SQL Server 2005, installs the DTS package designer for modifying DTS packages. However, you can download and install the DTS package designer, and use it to modify DTS packages. For information about how to install designtime support for DTS packages, see How to Install Support for Data Transformation Services Packages. After installing this download, you can view and modify DTS packages from Management Studio, or from the Execute DTS 2000 Package Task Editor in Business Intelligence Development Studio.p  pFor information about how to manage certain DTS application properties that affect the DTS design environment, see Setting DTS Application Properties.p  pArrow icon used with Back to Top linkBack to top of this section Migrating SQL Server 2000 DTS Packagesp  pSQL Server provides the DTS Package Migration Wizard for migrating DTS packages to the Integration Services package format. When you select Integration Services for installation, Setup also installs the DTS Package Migration Wizard. You can optionally use the DTS Package Migration Wizard to upgrade DTS packages to the Integration Services format. During migration, the wizard copies the DTS packages and then recreates them in the Integration Services format. The source packages are left intact and are not modified. NoteNotep  pThe DTS Package Migration Wizard is available in the following editions of SQL Server Standard, Enterprise, and Developer.p  pMany packages can be fully migrated to Integration Services, especially DTS packages that use tasks, connections, and other objects that have an equivalent in Integration Services. Other packages can be migrated successfully by encapsulating certain tasks or features that cannot be migrated in an Execute DTS 2000 Package task. For more information, see Migrating Data Transformation Services Packages.p  pBefore running the DTS Package Migration Wizard, you might want to install and run Upgrade Advisor to analyze your existing packages for migration issues. For more information, see Using Upgrade Advisor to Prepare for Upgrades. NoteNotep  pUpgrade Advisor cannot analyze, and the DTS Package Migration Wizard cannot migrate, DTS packages that are saved in the msdb database of an instance of SQL Server 7.0. However, the Upgrade Advisor can analyze, and the DTS Package Migration Wizard can migrate, SQL Server 7.0 DTS packages that are saved as structured storage files. Also, the Upgrade Advisor can analyze, and the DTS Package Migration Wizard can migrate, SQL Server 7.0 DTS packages that are saved in the msdb database of an instance of SQL Server 7.0 that has been upgraded to SQL Server 2005 or a later version.p  pArrow icon used with Back to Top linkBack to the top of this section Migrating Command Lines for Executing Packagesp  pTo understand how the commandline options for the SQL Server 2000 DTS dtsrun utility dtsrun.exe map to the options for the Integration Services dtexec utility dtexec.exe, see Mapping dtsrun Options to dtexec Options.p  pArrow icon used with Back to Top linkBack to the top of this section Support for ODBC Data Sourcesp  pTo load or save data to an ODBC data source, you can use an ADO.NET source or destination and select the .NET Framework Data Provider for ODBC. It is also possible to use the Script component to create an ad hoc ODBC source or destination for use in a single package. For more information, see Creating an ODBC Destination with the Script Component.p  pArrow icon used with Back to Top linkBack to the top of this section Support for Meta Data Services Repository Packagesp  pSQL Server 2000 Meta Data Services, typically known as the Repository, is a deprecated component. SQL Server 2005 and later versions do not install or use the Repository.p  pThe DTS designer and the dtsrun utility continue to support DTS packages that were saved to the Repository.p  pIntegration Services supports the Repository only in the Upgrade Advisor and the DTS Package Migration Wizard, and only if the Repository redistributable files are installed on the local computer. These files are normally present when the computer has either SQL Server 2000 or the SQL Server 2000 tools installed. When the Repository redistributable files are present, the Upgrade Advisor can scan, and the DTS Package Migration Wizard can migrate, DTS packages that were saved to the Repository. When the Repository redistributable files are not present, the Upgrade Advisor and the DTS Package Migration Wizard can only be used on DTS packages that were saved to SQL Server or to structured storage files.p  pThe Integration Services Execute DTS 2000 Package task cannot run a DTS package that was saved to the Repository. However, the SQL Server 2000 DTS runtime can run such a package. Thus, to have an Integration Services package run a DTS package that is stored in the Repository, follow these stepsp  precodeMake sure that the Repository files are installed on the computer that is running the Integration Services package. To install the Repository files, install SQL Server 2000, the SQL Server 2000 tools, or the Repository redistributable files on the local computer  Create a new DTS package to act as a wrapper for the DTS package that is stored in the Repository. In this DTS wrapper package, use an Execute Package task to execute the package that is stored in the Repository. Save this wrapper package to SQL Server or as a structured storage file.  Use an Execute DTS 2000 Package task in the Integration Services package to run the new DTS wrapper package. codepre  pArrow icon used with Back to Top linkBack to the top of this section Support for SQL Server 2000 DTS Packages in SQL Server Expressp  pSQL Server Express does not include Integration Services nor does it support DTS packages. However, you can work with DTS packages on a server that is running SQL Server Express by using one of the following methodsp  precodeTo run existing DTS packages on a server that is running SQL Server Express, you need the DTS runtime on the server. Although SQL Server Express does not include the DTS runtime, you can install the DTS runtime on the server by either installing the SQL Server 2000 client tools or the DTS redistributable files.  To modify existing DTS packages on a server that is running SQL Server Express, you can use the SQL Server 2000 tools. You can also modify the packages remotely in SQL Server Management Studio on a server that is running one of these versions of SQL Server Workgroup, Standard, Enterprise, or Developer. SQL Server Express does not include SQL Server Management Studio.  To migrate existing DTS packages to Integration Services, you need the DTS Package Migration Wizard that is installed with Integration Services. SQL Server Express does not include this wizard.

Negative 549 pHere is my story p  pIm working on a not so large WPF  C application implementing for the first time inversion of control with the help of Unity Framework. It is mostly finished. My problem come from my bootstrapper class, in wich I register my types in the Unity container.

So I was wondering if there was a better way to handle registeration. I was thinking, that maybe p  pstrong1. What are you complaining of  Every one does it this waystrong Mmmh, I doubt itp  pstrong2. I have misunderstood the interest of ioc and too much of my classes need registeration.strong Well, what would be the interest of ioc p  pstrong3. I simply created a ravioli app with too much different classes, I should merge somestrong I think I did my best to find a balancep  pstrong4.I should not have one macro bootstrapper, but the main one should call specialized ones, one by librairy for examplestrong okay, that begins to sound good. After all, the librairies themselves should know better than others what they contain. But I absolutely dont know how to handle it without having my container tramping in every libraries, these having a dependency over Unity...p  pSo, is one of this points good, or did I just miss the

Negative 549 pThere is a screen in my app, where a user can see clouds flying along an arc. This move implemented with help of strongCAKeyframeAnimationstrong and works correctly.

Negative 549 pIm currently developing a wrapper for a C library so it can be used in MATLAB. I want my C objects to be in MATLAB so the user can do something with them. Actually Im casting those C objects to codevoid code because MATLAB only supports C headers.

I cant do anything with it besides to pass it to another C function, like the followingp  pcodedeclspecdllexport int doSomethingWithPtr void ptrcodep  pSo Im calling coderesult  calllibLibName, doSomethingWithPtr, ptrcode within MATLAB which works perfectly fine and executes this function with the pointer as argument. Ive debugged the C code and the pointer is the same as the one returned from codegetPtrcode.p  pMy C function needs more than one pointer to work like intended by the C library. I already passed numeric data within MATLAB matrices to C which works perfectly with the C type codemxArraycode see a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.dedehelpmatlabapirefmxarray.html relnofollowhttpwww.mathworks.dedehelpmatlabapirefmxarray.htmla. For the purpose of handing over multiple pointers to C I constructed an array of MATLAB codelib.pointercodes like thisp  precodeA  []  for i  110     ptr  calllibLibName, getPtr, i     A  [A, ptr]     end codepre  pAnd Im calling another C function codedeclspecdllexport int doSomethingWithPtrArray mxArray ptrarrcode within MATLABp  precodeptr  calllibLibName, doSomethingWithPtrArray, A codepre  pWithin the C function Im getting the correct array dimensions with codemxGetNptrarrcode and codemxGetMptrarrcode. I also can retrieve the data pointer withp  pcodevoid mexPtr  mxGetDataptrarrcodep  pThe problem is that codemexPtrcode and the following pointers point to locations in the memory I didnt even allocate or know before. Perhaps MATLAB does some intelligent wrapping when calling the function with codevoid code and doesnt do that, when Im passing over the array. I think Im getting the addresses to the MATLAB codelib.pointercode wrapper objectp  pDoes anybody have a clue or a workaround how I get the correct pointers out of the mxArray, so I can evaluate multiple pointers at oncep

Negative 549 pIm writing a C program which is going to run a bunch of worker threads on recursive data, such that even though Ive increased the default stack space, its possible that a thread might hit a stack overflow.p  pThe ideal would be to have the stack dynamically expand as needed, but if thats not possible, its acceptable to have the program fail, and for the user to retry after recompiling it with a larger stack size.p  pThe problem with the default behavior of the program crashing with no error message is that the user has no way of knowing what the problem was or what to do about it for all the user knows, the program might have tried to divide by zero or dereference a null pointer so if the program must crash, Id like it to print Stack overflow to stderr first.p  pObviously there isnt going to be a solution in portable C but I would be happy with one solution that works on Windows and another that works on Linux.p  pLooking at ways to have the program exit with an informative error message on Windows, Ive been reading the documentation on vectored and structured exception handling one problem is that these seem to be local to a thread, and a thread cant safely write to stderr at best you get a race condition.p  pIs there a known method of dealing with thisp

Negative 549 pI have an excel file with several Macros. In this file there is a pivot table with a column called Customer, which contains several elements thousands. What i want to know is , is there any efficient way to set up the filter of this column to specific values  p  pThe reason why i am asking is because the spread sheet will ask the user to select some customers, which are stored in a array, i want to take the values in this array and filter the pivot table acordingly.p  pI was able to do this by looping the pivot table through all the items, making them visible  false, and then making those that were selected, visible  true. However, the issue with this approach is that it takes so much time to process.p  pI have seen some examples in the web of people using the CubeField option, however, i am unsure how to use it  The syntax is a bit complex , i have tried the following and it gives me an error p  pWorksheetsAnalysis.PivotTablesPivotTable1.PivotFieldsSupplierCode.ClearAllFilters WorksheetsAnalysis.PivotTablesPivotTable1.PivotFieldsSupplierCode.CubeField.EnableMultiplePageItems  True Set pt  WorksheetsAnalysis.PivotTablesPivotTable1 With PT pt.PivotFields[PivotTable1].[SupplierCode].VisibleItemsList  Array[PivotTable1].[SupplierCode].amp[106214], [PivotTable1].[SupplierCode].amp[101160]  Here i am not using the array values , just trying to set the customers directly, 1 supplier code is 106214 and the other is 101160p  pAny help to get me to the right direction will be highly appreciated. Also, please note that i am not looking to set the filter to 1 item only, i am able to do this already without any issues, the issue here is to selct multiple values at once, without looping though all the possible values that could be selectedp  pThank you in advancep

From here I select the images from the database and show them as thumbnails in the photo gallery, when clicked on the image it shows a large version where you can votelike and comments etc.p  pNow what I am trying to do is make 3 category pages, basically 3x the photo gallery that shows the thumbnails.p  pI have 3 different tables in my database where I insert the images in to. So I copied the photo gallery 3x and the original upload table in the database 3x. How ever I do not want to create 3 upload.php files for each photo gallery.php file.p  pWhat Im trying to do is have 3 radio button choices on my upload page and with the choice made there, the image gets uploaded into the matching database table photo1, 2 or 3.p  pI have been trying to do this with Functions etc. but I just cant get it to work, I am probably doing something really simple, really stupid.p  pThis is the code i have for the radio button and getting the imagep  precode    titel  Image     query  SELECT  FROM i268296studie.fotos ORDER BY fotoID DESC      result  mysqliqueryconn, query or diequery error  . mysqlierrorconn      fotos  array     create array from images in database     whiledata  mysqlifetchassocresult              fotos[]  arraysrc gt data[src], id gt data[fotoID]      gt  ltsection iduploadgt                                            ltform methodpost actionupload.php  enctypemultipartformdatagt                      ltlabel forbestandgtUpload imageltlabelgtltbrgtltbrgt                     ltinput typefile namebestand idfilegtltbrgtltbrgt                     ltlabel forcategoriegt Categorie ltlabelgt                         ltinput typeradio namecat valuecat1gtPortrait                         ltinput typeradio namecat valuecat2gtLandscape                         ltinput typeradio namecat valuecat3gtOther                     ltinput typesubmit namesubmit valueUploadgt                 ltformgt                      ltsectiongt         ltphp                  gt             ltsection classimagesgt                 ltphp                  show image thumbnails in photogallery                 foreachfotos as foto                                    gt                 lta hreffotoinfo.phpfotoIDltphp echo foto[id]gtgtltimg classimage srcltphp echo uploadthumbt.foto[src]gtgtltagt                 ltphp                                    gt             ltsectiongt codepre  pThe above code I have 3 times surrounded by HTML etc. as the photo gallery pages.p  pThis is my Upload file ill leave most of the thumbnail making code out of it since its only about the upload part.p  precodetitel  Image     dirupload     allowedExts  arrayjpg, jpeg, gif, png     answer POST[cat]       Properties of the to be uploaded file     fileName  FILES[bestand][name] file name     fileType  FILES[bestand][type] file format     fileSize  FILES[bestand][size] file size     tmpName   FILES[bestand][tmpname] temporary save location for file     error  FILES[bestand][error] error check for file      fp  fopentmpName, r     content  freadfp, filesizetmpName     content  addslashescontent     fclosefp         ifgetmagicquotesgpc                  fileName  addslashesfileName                 select image from database and check if it already exists     sql  SELECT  FROM i268296studie.fotos WHERE src  fileName     result  mysqliqueryconn, sql or diequery error  . mysqlierrorconn      data  mysqlifetchassocresult     numrowsmysqlinumrowsresult     ifnumrows gt 0          echo File already exists ltbrgt     echo    lta hreffotogallerij.phpgtReturn to homepageagt           else                  if file doesnt exist move to database, create thumbnail path         if moveuploadedfile tmpName,dir.fileName                     function categorycat, titel, filename                      global conn             query  INSERT INTO i268296studie.cat titel, src VALUES titel, fileName INSERT file into database             result  mysqliqueryconn, query or diequery error  . mysqlierrorconn                       tname  t.fileName             tpath  dir.thumb             tnamestate  tpath.tname             tptype  substrfileType,6             ttype  imagecreatefromtptype             name  fileName             path  dir             namestate  path.name             width  100             height  100             listwidthorig, heightorig  getimagesizenamestate             ratioorig  widthorigheightorig                 if widthheight gt ratioorig                                   width  heightratioorig                                   else                                   height  widthratioorig                  codepre  pHow ever I am staring myself blind on how to fix it or where to place it so it works.

Negative 549 pI have a python based website on appengine. What this means is my server is written in python and I am using the usual webapp2 and jinja2 to help serve my pages. What I want to accomplish is that depending on whether someone is accessing my website through iPhone, Android, or a normal computer i.e. desktop or laptop to server the webpage in appropriate format. I supposed there are many ways I can do thisp  ol liI could do it through JavaScript and then redirect to the appropriate mobile urlli liOr I can do it in Python and serve the correct pageli ol  pWhat I mean in code2code is something likep  precodeclass ServeMyPagewebapp2.RequestHandler     def getself       ...do some work to determine the device, such as screen size       if deviceiPhone         ...get the iPhone page and serve it         self.response.out.writeiPhonePage       else ... etc, etc codepre  pIn my snippet I am doing it before serving the page. I imagine this is faster as it does not wait for the page to load and then check with some JavaScript to see if I should change the content to the appropriate format. I hope this is clear.p  pSo what is the best way to do this Should I do it in JavaScript some other way or as I show above If as I show above, what might the code look like My problem is also technical in that I dont know what code to put in the Python.

Is there any sane reason that make a static or shared library preferred over a plain Obj filep  pWhen creating a staticshared library we lose much information and also chance for optimization wich dont matters to me. Instead we could compile our source files into Obj files, and then link all Obj files also the Obj files of the library into the final executable.p  p  we retain all info, especially usefull for exception handling and preventing duplicated typeinfo dependency injection with C relies on C11 Typeinfo, but theres no guarantee youll not get a duplicated codestdtypeinfocode object for different classes in different libraries.p  pIf visibility warry you, you can do a Ghost CompileLink step compile application and then link with the static library to see if we get undefined symbol because accessing internal stuff and then proceed with the real CompileLink everything to Obj files and then Obj to the Executablep  pThe final executable will be smaller and faster, there will not be issues with exceptions and the build system will be more Emscripten friendly .p  pDo you see possible issues Im using already that and works flawless, but maybe already existing code may have duplicate issues Maybe unfeasible for large codebasesp  pstrongSMALL EXAMPLEstrongp  pMy static library is compiled from 2 filesp  pMyFoo.hppp  precodedeclare MyFoo to be internal to my library void attribute visibility hidden MyFoo codepre  pMyFoo.cppp  precodeinclude ltMyFoo.hppgt include ltiostreamgt void MyFoo     stdcoutltltMyFooltltstdendl  codepre  pMyBar.cppp  precodeinclude ltMyBar.hppgt include ltMyFoo.hppgt include ltiostreamgt void MyBar     stdcoutltltMyBar calling  MyFoo calling MyFoo  codepre  pWhen we compile, we get 2 ObjFilesp  precodeMyFoo.o MyBar.o codepre  pWhen we link we getp  precodeMyLib.a codepre  pMyBar, can still see and call MyFoo otherwise it could not compile.p  pWhen I create my executable if I link against codeMyLib.acode I can call only codeMyBarcode wich is correctp  precodeinclude ltMyBar.hppgt include ltMyFoo.hppgt int main     MyBar ok     MyFoo  error undefined symbol     return 0  codepre  pThats because I lost some info desired in most cases note I had to specify codehiddencode, but hence the visibility feature turns into a problem because hiding stuff we could end up with strongdifferent classes inside different libraries that have the same full qualified namesstrongp  pThats an issue when throwing exceptions, or when trying to use codestdtypeinfocodep  pSo the only viable solution seems doing a 2 steps compilation, 1 is just to check we are not breaking visibility and hence the API contract, the 2nd build is to avoid the issues in the aforementioned link strange to debug exceptions behaviour or misterious crashes.p  pLinking codeMyFoo.ocode,codeMyBar.ocode,codemain.ocode togheter would be conceptually wrong because allows compilation of the following codep  precodeinclude ltMyBar.hppgt include ltMyFoo.hppgt int main     MyBar ok     MyFoo  compile NOT OK     return 0  codepre  pbut linking object files togheter is the only way to avoid exceptions issues.p

Negative 549 pThe documentation is not terribly clear on how Node.js treats calls scheduled by setTimeoutp  blockquote   pNode.js makes no guarantees about the exact timing of when the   callback will fire, nor of the ordering things will fire in. The   callback will be called as close as possible to the time specified.p blockquote  pSay theres an expired timer. Therere also some IO events waiting to be handled. Will Node.js elect to process all the IO events first before firing the timer This is how WMTIMER works in Windows. Im guessing Node.js might behave in the same way. Otherwise, why would there be setImmediate People could just use setTimeout with a 0 delay.p

Negative 549 pIm trying to use elasticsearch as a integration tool which can match records from different sources. Im combining filters and query for this.

Negative 549 pIm trying to figure out how best to render a PDF generated through the a hrefhttpsgithub.comdompdfdompdf relnofollowDOMPDF wrappera in my Laravel project. Im able to generate the PDF in its own window via a route like thisp  precoderoutes.php Routepostcontract, PDFControllercontract  ...  PDFController.php public function contract      signature  Inputgetsignaturename     dob  Inputgetsignaturedob     date  Inputgetsignaturedate      data  arraynamegtsignature, dobgtdob, dategtdate      pdf  PDFloadViewcontract, data     return pdfgtstreamcontract.pdf  codepre  pTheres also a method to download the PDF. But what Id like to do is render the PDF in its own section of a view. My first thought is that theres something like an codeiframecode to do the rendering, but since its using codePOSTcode variables and Routes, Im not sure if that complicates things. Im not strongly attached to the DOMPDF either, so if there are other modules that work better, Im definitely open to other options as well.p

Negative 549 pI have come across a curious situation where students Im a teaching assistant in this context have to implement their own version of a Singly Linked List SLL and compare it empirically with the Java standard library implementation of a Doubly Linked List.p  pAnd thats where it gets weird Ive seen multiple students note that the DLL profiles at roughly 0.5 extra space utilization compared to an SLL containing an equal number of elements of the same type. All the while basic analysis of the data structures tells me that a SLL has 2 references per node 1 to the next element, and 1 to the contained value whereas a DLL has 3 an additional one reference to the previous element. In other words, that is 50 more space usage per node disregarding the size of the contained value.p  pThe contained values are mostly Integer value objects so I dont think the size of the contained values matters too much here.p  pWhat causes this strong2 orders of magnitudestrong difference Im not entirely sure that JVMcollections libraries optimization can cover the whole difference otherwise itd have to be one hell of a JVMjava std lib optimization.p
Negative 549 pIn advance Id like to apologize for the length of this post S [EDITS BELOW]p  pI would like to do a sample size calculation for a cluster randomized trial with a binary outcome. Outcome is whether patients make use of a help service or not Y use help service YN Patients are nested within clinics five types which are nested within hospitals. p  pWe have an education program directed at hospital staff to promote the help service, and the main question to be answered by the trial is Does the education program increase the proportion of patients making use the of the help line in the first 3 months after the completion of the education program. The education program will be rolled out in experimental hospitals nothing will be done in control hospitals.p  pNot all patients will be using the service, as not all of them will have unmet needs after talking to their cliniciannurses. The level of unmet needs is believed to differ between clinics clinics providing more severe treatments have higher unmet needs, and thus a larger group of potential helpline users.p  pExpected percentage of patients using the help service in control sites  10 Expected percentage of patients using the help service in experimental sites  20p  pIntraclass coefficient is unknown, but other studies have shown ICC of 0.09 and 0.15. I am interested in assessing sample size over the ICC range of 0 to 0.20.p  pFor now, I assume that the education program can be rolled out instantaneously in all hospitals randomized to the experimental treatment and that patients only visit 1 clinic. The data available to assess the effectiveness of the program are    Number of patients seen per clinic in the three month period    Number of patients using the help service in the three month period We do not have individual patient data as some might like to stay anonymous when using the help service, but aggregate data at the clinic level.p  pI have found the R package CRTSize, that can calculate the number of clusters needed for two level data patients within hospitalp  precodelibraryCRTSize  pc.0.10 pe.0.20 ICCsteps lt c0.0000001, 0.05,0.10, 0.15 Mstepsc25, 50,100,200,300  results lt data.framepec, pcc, mc, ICCc, Clusterscontrc,  Clustersexpc   fori in seqalongICCsteps  form in seqalongMsteps printpasteICC,ICCsteps[i], m, Msteps[m]  mm lt n4propspepe., pcpc., mMsteps[m], ICCICCsteps[i], alpha0.05, power  0.80, AR1, two.tailedTRUE, digits3  resultstemp lt data.framepepe., pcpc., mmmm, ICCmmICC, ClusterscontrceilingmmnC, ClustersexpceilingmmnE results lt rbindresults, resultstemp      results resultsTotalClustersNeeded lt resultsClusterscontr   resultsClustersexp  parmarc4,4,3,4 plotresultsm, resultsTotalClustersNeeded, typen, xlabNumber of samples within cluster, ylabTotal number of clusters needed half controlhalf intervention, las1grid titlepasteTotal  clusters needed to have 80 power with n alfa 0.05 to show a difference between, pc.100,  vs. , pe.100,  fori in seqalongICCsteps pointsresultsm[resultsICC ICCsteps[i]], resultsTotalClustersNeeded[resultsICC ICCsteps[i]], typel textmaxMsteps0.90, minresultsTotalClustersNeeded[resultsICC ICCsteps[i]]3, pasteICC, ICCsteps[i], las1  codepre  pSo when I have around 200 pts per hospital, and ICC of 0.15, id need about 65 hospitals half randomized to control, half randomized to interventionp  pI dont think it can model the three levels I will have in my data ptsclinicshospitals. Additional complications will be that hospitals will vary in the number of patients seen and that not all hospitals will have all types of clinics as some hospitals might be more specialized. p  pSo I am trying to simulate some data.  I dont know how to simulate data with specific ICCs, but I think I found a way around it see below.  Patients in each controlhospital have 10 probability to call the help line 20 in intervention hospitals. I have added a hospital specific error around these percentages. Each hospital has between 14 clinics. The proportion used to draw  x samples from the binomial distribution is the same between the clinics within a hospital x is number of patients in a clinic.p  pI have tweaked the hospital error in a way that the ICC is around 0.15. However, the ICC varies for each simulation. I thought, that when I run many simulations Id get enough simulations within say 0.1450.155 to say something about power at ICC  0.15. p  pThis is what I have done so farp  precode libraryreshape2

For example, we see that for an ICC of around 0.15, we would have about 8385 power to detect a difference between controlexperimental hospitals when using 30 hospitals in total 15 contr 15 exp. One thing that is clear, is that the power does NOT decrease with increasing ICC, which we would expect. So something is wrong in the coding  Would it have to do with the way ICC  is calculated An increase in ICC is either an increase in between hospital variance, a decrease in within hospital variance, or both.p  pNot sure how to proceed Comments welcomep  pEDIT 1 I guess its not really fair to look at the power within the emobservedem ICC. I should be looking at the power under the emtrue ICCem. I guess then my biggest problem is how to simulate data sets with with a fixed underlying ICC...p

Negative 549 pa newb to R programming here and beginnerintermediate at best in SASSQl so please be kind.

Error messages now received is object is not numeric or logical returning NA and 1 In is.naobject  is.na applied to nonlist or vector of type NULLp  pThe whole part with subsets works just fine outsides the confinement of a function. What givesp  pedit2 ok, Ive figured the problem has to do with sub2part. Calling the functioning and giving pollutant the value nitrate simply does not work. Why What could be done herep

I now want it to create multiple values.

Negative 549 pIm currently writing an AngularJS application, but Im a bit stuck when implementing a loading indicator.p  pLets say that I have a controller with an initialize methodp  precodeOfficeUIModule.controllerOfficeUIController, function       Initialize      function Initialize            Logic to load the entire page here setting scope values, reading cookies, ...        codepre  pSo, above we have a controller with one function in it, called Initialize which will sets the necessary scope values, reading values from cookies, writing away cookies when needed. In other words, it can take some time.p  pThen I do have a variable to see if the application is loading and a codescopecode function to check if its loading. See the modified controller belowp  precodeOfficeUIModule.controllerOfficeUIController, function      var isLoading  true      Initialize      function Initialize            Logic to load the entire page here setting scope values, reading cookies, ...          isLoading  false           scope.isLoading  function  return isLoading   codepre  pNow, I do have my HTML that contains 2 div elements, one to show when the page is loading, one to show when the page is not loading anymore, based on the function codeisLoadingcode. However, when I consume the page, first the loading section is showed, which is good, then the application itself is showed which is good aswell, but I see some flickering because the HTML is still being rendered. Icons are being placed on their correct place and other stuff.p  pHow can I avoid this and make sure that the application section is only showed when the page has entirly been loaded.p

Negative 549 pIm building a data analysis platform in MATLAB. One of the systems features need to create many plots. At any given time only one plot is available and the user can traverse to the nextprevious upon request the emphasis here is that there is no need for multiple windows to be open.p  pInitially I used the codefigurecode command each time a new plot was shown, but I noticed that, as the user traverse to the next plot, this command took a bit longer than I wanted. Degrading usability. So I tried using codesubplotcode instead and it worked much faster.p  pSeeing this behavior I ran a little experiment, timing both. The first time codefigurecode runs it takes about 0.3 seconds and codesubplotcode takes 0.1 seconds. The mean run time for codefigurecode is 0.06 seconds with standard deviation of 0.05, while codesubplotcode take only 0.002 with standard deviation of 0.001. It seems that codesubplotcode is an order of magnitude faster.p  pThe question is In situation when only one window will be available at any given time, is there any reason to use figurep  pIs there any value lost in using subplot in generalp  psimilar consideration can be made even if you can either only once.p

Negative 549 pI have Magento 1.9 and I am using a remote server for the storage of images.p  pI created a new attribute text field for setting the external image url. I succeded to show the external image in the view and listgrid pages of the products but it is not efficient.p  pMy question is p  pIs there any solution to completely rewrite the base image url  this will make the change in all Magento site without modifying the template.p  pFrom my searchs I know that images uploaded were added via addImagetoMediaGallery... with the file path as one of the parameters. So the idea is to find a way to rewrite with setdata maybe the temp image url and so echo the external url instead of the temp image url.p

Negative 549 pI am coding a pretty simple app that allows users to make certain selections and receive a random quote based on their selections. I have a pretty good idea on how to actually produce the quote but am stuck on how to track user selections until they get to the final viewpage.p  pSpecifically, my question is, how do I go about storing the users selections in a variable or an array in a way that I can use it both on the last page and update it from any page for the quote generation I havent been using Angular for that long but what Ive tried so far is making a service that includes an array for storing variables and then using directives on the buttons to update the array but this seems messy in the end with so many selections and it doesnt actually work right now.p  pAny and all suggestions or resources on how to achieve what I want are greatly appreciated lt3p

Negative 549 pWhat is the correct approach for reading data from a bulkin endpoint i.e. What is the best way to arrange QHTDsp  pI am currently developing a bare metal embedded USB EHCI driver i.e. not linux or Windows. My driver appears to be working fairly well, it correctly enumerates and talks with any attached USB device. It is intended to be used mainly for communicating with a 3G dongle modem.p  pMy current strategy is to have a single QH with a fairly large circular list of TDs in the async schedule. As each TD goes nonactive, I read the associated data and immediately mark it active again. p  pThis approach seems to work well until the data being received through the dongle goes above about 1k per second. At this point random blocks go missing, being a 3G dongle I can see that the PPP framing is sometimes missing.p  pChanging the rate at which I check for new data makes no difference. Diagnostics amount to printfs.p  pI have assumed it is possible to reuse the bulk receive QHTD chain without needing to reclaim it and submit a new one. Is the correct approach to submit multiple QHTD chains as is done with bulkout requestsp  pThe firmware is running on a standard x86 32bit PC with a standard 808627CC NM10ICH7 Family USB2 EHCI Controller on the motherboard.p  pThere is no internal USB hub, although support has been written for one if attached.p

Negative 549 pI was requested to prevent access to a website. There are two ways I know I can choose   1. At apache level a tool like this a hrefhttpwww.ip2location.comblockvisitorsbycountry.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.ip2location.comblockvisitorsbycountry.aspxa which generates a long htaccess file with list of IP ranges. The other way I know of is using PHP be it a local DB, remote webservice or just a list just like the htaccess. My question is what is more effective   I think that if I use apache, it is faster then PHP but done each and every page accessed. If I use PHP, I can do it once and save in the session. What is the more efficient way Thanksp

Negative 549 pI have been searching around the web, but didnt find anything useful telling me how to start.p  pI have an Atmega328p. I think this is the easiest controller to start with for this kind of things.p  pI would like to write my own bootloader. Where should I start to write code forp
Negative 549 pSo I have an ASP.NET MVC 5 app with ASP.NET Identity 2.0 running.  Everything is pretty okay, but I want to refactor my code and I am wondering what alternatives exist to my current implementation.  Let me explain.p  pI have the Controllers in the root of my project as well as many in the Areas folder of the project.  Nearly all of them inherit from a codeBaseControllercode class, which in turn inherits from codeSystem.Web.Mvc.Controllercode.  This codeBaseControllercode looks something like thisp  precodepublic class BaseController      protected ApplicationUserManager userManager     protected ApplicationRoleManager roleManager     protected readonly MyDbContext db  new MyDbContext      public BaseController                public BaseControllerApplicationUserManager um, ApplicationRoleManager rm              UserManager  um         RoleManager  rm           public ApplicationUserManager UserManager  ...      public ApplicationRoleManager RoleManager  ...       region Utility Methods       Here are over 60 utility methods that are basically queries on db      endregion  codepre  pMore methods are on the way and I cant help but feel there is a better way than having them in a base class when logically, not every controller should directly inherit such methods.p  pMoving them to codeMyDbContextcode inherits codeIdentityDbContextcode essentially does nothing but move them to a emmore applicableem file.  What Im imagining is having custom utility methods for each DbSet in codeMyDbContextcode but Im not sure how to do that.  Something like the following would be idealp  precodeSemester thisSemester  db.Semesters.GetCurrentSemester codepre  porp  precodeSelectList semesters  db.Semesters.GetAllSemestersAsSelectList codepre  pwhere codeSemesterscode is of type codeDbSetltSemestergtcode in both examples.p  pCan anyone offer a solutionp
Negative 549 pI am using the CQtQML stack to develop a GUI application.p  pOn application startup, I have a splash screen that displays while the main window is loading. I want the splash screen to provides updates lets say, every 200ms to the loading status of the main window.p  pHowever, the loading of the main window causes the 200ms this is the update rendering of the splash screen to get interrupted. The code which slows down the splash screen isp  precodethisgtengine  new QQmlApplicationEngine enginegtloadQUrlqrcmainWindow.qml  This line causes splash screen rendering to lag codepre  pSo I thought, o.k., Ill put the splash screen process into a higher priority thread, so that its renderupdate process wont get as interrupted.p  pBut...I have found out that all codeQQmlApplicationEnginecode objects must be createdused in the same thread, namely the one which codeQApplicationcode a singleton is created in.p  pI get that if I had heavily computational operations I could put them into a worker thread, but this scenario is a little different, because the thing that is causing the lag is a GUI method call, which Qt doesnt allow to be in a separate thread.p  pHow can I achieve what I want with this limitationp
Negative 549 pI use Fedora 22 OS and Im trying to get started with Play Framework. Naturally, Im trying to build the simplest application possible so I can have a starting point. p  pI tried to follow the guide at the documentation a hrefhttpswww.playframework.comdocumentation2.4.xNewApplication relnofollowhttpswww.playframework.comdocumentation2.4.xNewApplicationa as close as I could, but Im getting no success here. It fails when I call the activator inside the base folder of the project and indicates me some unresolved dependencies. Ill post the steps Ive taken so I can show what Ive done and the problem as clearly as possible, including some information about Java I read somewhere I should use Oracle Java instead of OpenJDK, so I downloaded the latest Java SE JDK 7 and sbt, which I belive to be related to the process. My OS is in portuguese, so a few lines will be in portuguese, but as they refer to well known commands basically the command alternatives, I dont think it will harm the comprehension.p  precodesu   [rootlocalhost ] alternatives config java  H 3 programas que oferecem java.

Negative 549 pI faced today a problem that leads me in a gotcha of strongActiveRecordstrong use.p  pActiveRecord returns for a specific query with strongincludesstrong certain amount of objects in an strongActiveRelationstrong object.

Negative 549 pI set my maximum allocation vcores to 1 in yarnsite.xml, and the number of physical cores to 2. All nodes are the same. However, sometims, YARN allocates 3 containers to a node. It reports that 1 vcores are available on that node. What ends up happening is that nodemanager shuts down on that node, and the job fails. How do you prevent YARN from over allocating vcores There are other nodes available, with 0 vcores used. I already specified the minimum and maximum amount of vcores that can be allocated and the number of physical vcores per node. When I look at the YARN reports, everything looks right.p

Negative 549 pIm currently using a Microsoft Kinect for Windows in a project. I use the Kinect for 3D scanning an object and then I want to reconstruct it to get a .stl file which can be 3D printed. I tried using Kinect Fusion Kinect Fusion ExplorerWPF which is in C to do this, but I noticed that the reconstruction is taking too long, and I have to rotate the Kinect very slowly around the object to get a good 3D reconstruction. Also, the program loses track of the reconstruction after capturing about 30 frames, so Im not able to get a full 360 degree view of the object. Is there any other software or library I can use to solve this problemp

Negative 549 pI would like to be notified of the button power being pressed on Android. To be clear, I am not looking to override the power button event, but simply being notified of when it has happened. From everything Ive researched so far, there is no such thing in Android. Please let me know if there is, or if there is one planned for Androids near future.p  pUntil now, I have been using screen onoff broadcasts in order to essentially guess that the power button has been pressed. However, since KK Watch API 20 or Lollipop API 21, even this, is no longer accurate. This is because although the broadcast is still named ACTIONSCREENON , they no longer refer to when the screen turned on but instead when the device became interactive, which can be delayed compared to when the screen actually came on. The same is true for ACTIONSCREENOFF, it actually refers to when the device is no longer in interactive mode, not exactly when the screen turned off. p  pThe Display class has some different display states which do actually refer to the screen state STATEOFF, STATEON, STATEDOZE, STATEDOZESUSPEND, or STATEUNKNOWN. You can get the display state with getState but theres no sort of broadcast system to notify that the state has changed, as far as I know.p  pDoes anyone know a way to get more accurately notified of the power button being pressed or the screen changing state If it comes down to it, I wouldnt mind a root solution either.p
