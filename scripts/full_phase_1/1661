Positive 1661 pI request your support as Im honestly trying to properly create an inventory of computer equipment . Table devices serial number , mark, model . Table users  name, email , area. It requires the CRUD , as well as all the history .

The language I use is PHP and MySQL, but what I require is to understand the problem fully because I dont know how to make it  properly, what pages to create, as how I will relate the tables. I do not require language but a guide to the whole problem because is easy to learn the language  but I dont have the idea clearfully, in special when I attack the problem it grows insanely.p

Positive 1661 pI am new to php and trying to make a search function on name and date but I have a problem.p  pMy problem is that the search function sees all the effected rows from the search but does not show them. I load all the data from the database as default on my page and I want that if the codeGET[go]code from search isset that all the default data isnt shown anymore and only the results from the search are shown. Now he always shows that default data. Except from the codeGET[by]code there is no data shown.p  pI also try to use PDO but I dont know much about that.... so theres a possibility I am doing something wrong with that too.p  pMy PHP codep  precodeltphp               inisetdisplayerrors,1             inisetdisplaystartuperrors,1             errorreporting1              connect  to the database             dbhost  localhost             dbusername               dbpassword               dbname                db  new PDOmysqlhost .dbhost . dbname. dbname . ,dbusername,dbpassword               ifissetPOST[submit]                 ifissetGET[go]                     ifpregmatch[azAZ], POST[search]                         zoekPOST[search]                          vardumpzoek this will display on the screen the content of the variable                            query  the database table                         sqlSELECT v.vacatureID, v.werkgeverID, v.functie, v.omschrijvingKort, v.datum, w.werkgeverID, w.naamBedrijf, w.plaats, w.image FROM vacature AS v JOIN werkgever AS w ON v.werkgeverID  w.werkgeverID WHERE w.naamBedrijf LIKE   . zoek .

Positive 1661 pI am trying to migrate code from PEARMDB2 to the more standard PDO.  MDB2 has a specific Manager feature for accessing the database schema which PDO does not.  All of the posts that I have found about this all give solutions only for MySQL.  But the primary reason to use PDO is to avoid a database server specific implementation.  I appreciate that there is an enormous amount of variability between implementations and that some implementations may not provide any useful information.p

Positive 1661 pI am using PDO to access my data base and am looping using two while loops with fetch at the same time, seen belowp  precodeDBH  new PDOmysqlhostlocalhostdbnamedatabasecharsetutf8,dblogin,dbpass sql  SELECT  FROM table STH  DBHgtpreparesql STHgtexecute  while bmtable  STHgtfetchPDOFETCHASSOC   SQL Query sql1  QUERY HERE STH1  DBHgtpreparesql1 STH1gtexecute  Loops through using different handle, but what if I used STH again while row  STH1gtfetchPDOFETCHASSOC      SomeFunctionbmtable,row    codepre  pAs you can see above I am using a different statement handle STH, STH1 etc. Is this necessary Or can I use just one statement handle for everything. The reason I have used multiple handles is as the bmtable value that uses STH, will still be in use while I am fetching row wouldnt that change the value of bmtable or stop the fetch from working How does the handles with PDO work Especially when in this case I have two simultaneous fetch loops running at the same time using the same PDO connection. p  pSo the main thing I am looking for here is if I have two statements that are running simultaneously is it important that I used different handles But I can continue to use the same connection p  pThanks,p

Negative 1661 pI need to modify the hash, remove it after certain processing takes place so that if the user refreshes they do not cause the process to run again. p  pThis works fine in FF, but it seems that IE is reloading every time I try to change the hash. I think it is related to other things that are loading on the page, though I am not certain. I have an iframe that loads related to the process as well as some scripts that are still being fetched in the parent window.p  pI cant seem to figure out a good way to change the hash after all the loading completes. And, at the same time am not even positive that it is related to the loading.p  pAny ideas on how to solve thisp  pMore odd behavior The hash is coming from else where in the web app via a redirect. I have found if I simply add the hash by hand, adding myid to the url, it does not reload. It does not matter if I enter the hash on a page that has already loaded adding myid to the already existing url or by entering the complete url in a new tab.p
Negative 1661 pI was just wondering if theres any field which concerns the taskcontrol programming or at least thats the way I call it.p  pFor a better explanation of codetaskcontrolcode consider the following scenariop  pAn application masterthread waits for a command  which might be a particular action or a set of actions the application should perform.p  pWhen a command is received the masterthread creates a codetaskcode  spawns an independent thread which actually does the action and adds a record in its tasklist  thus keeping track of the time of execution, thread handle, task priority...etc.p  pThe masterthread awaits for any other incoming commands while taking care of all the tasks  e.g kills tasks running too long, prioritizes tasks with higher priorities, kills a task on a request of another task, limits the number of currently running tasks, allows task scheduling, cleans finished tasks threads and so on. The model is pretty similar to what we can see in OS dealing with running processes.p  pAre there any good practices programming such taskmodels or is there some theoretical work done in this field Maybe my question is too generalized, but at least I wanted to know whether there are any experiences working on such models or if theres a better approach.p  pThanks for any answers.p

This gave me an unexpected result, whereas option B went as expected. Here are some more detailsp  pI have a WAV file of a piano middleC. By definition, middleC is 260Hz, so I would expect the peak frequency to be at 260Hz and smaller peaks at harmonics.

With option B, the peak was at 260Hz.p  pAm I missing something The explanation that I came up with so far is that representing stereo data using a real and imag component implies that the two channels are independent, which, I suppose theyre not, and hence the messup.p

Negative 1661 pI really enjoy the JDBC abstraction in Java. I dont care what database type I am connecting to, or what driver is being used. Thats all set up in the DataSource object, and once its done, we just use connections. Its such a consistent API in order to commitrollback, perform transactions, and you only need to learn it once, and move on with your life. MySQLOracle  no worries, its all the same except for the SQL differencesp  pFour questions 1. What is the most popular equivalent for cc. 2. What is the best 3. Is there any api that mirrors the java api for connections Something very similar 4. I really like the DaoDaoImpl pattern often employed in Java. Do people do this same pattern in c. p  pThanks guysp
Negative 1661 pIm supposed to write a program with two functionsp  pOne function is responsible for building a data structure populated by a list of functions within a run you get a function pointer its run time a few seconds after starting a given program running. You should know to operate the function, adding the data structure of organs, how to do it more efficiently, saving tests, cross checks, etc..  The second function runs all the functions in order. If for example the start of the program once you have two functions were one of the five second time period of 12, first ran after 5 seconds and the other seven seconds after the first. Total 12 since the beginning.p  pAgain have to pay attention to how to do it, even in relation to the first function.  Everything was closed after the run, ie after a function has finished running is no longer an excuse again. All rerun of the program will be entering her new functions. p  pAttached are two implentations one awkward and not going through compiling at least for me with the main and an output for user, and the other is not cumbersome but without the main output and the user.  I need to use cumbersome with output to the user and then of course you also need main.

A PHP script runs every 5 minutes, scanning the FTP for .txt files that the devices send. The contents of the files are inserted into a MySQL database, and the .txt file deleted. Another PHP script that runs every 15 minutes will collate data from the database eg, sum values for last hour and produce an XML document, which are read by Flash dials.p  pObviously, there are plenty of issues here, and it is far from a realtime solution, which is what we are aiming for. The solution wed like is, that somehow, it could detect when the txt file is uploaded to the FTP, and only process the data then rather than having a set interval that runs. The data would still need to be added to the database, and be read by the frontend as soon as it is added to the database. Flash would be removed entirely, as its a little...ick...p  pWith exciting new technologies like node.js and Web Sockets socket.io, im sure we could improve this process greatly Im aware of Ajax being able to do something like this, but hear it has rather high overheads compared to Web Sockets.

Negative 1661 pIm currently having the following issue in my projectp  pIm using Core Data to retrieve data from a SQLite database. I use multiple views to display different portions of the database. I also implemented a searchBar to search the entire database. Since my data can be divided in three major sectors, through a BOOL value I tell the tableView to have 3 sections if the status is searching, otherwise the entire fetched results shall be divided opportunely in sections using the default Core Data function. When I perform a search the retrieved  data is sorted by type and title and the copied to a NSMutableArray called strongsearchResultsstrong. My data model has a strongtypestrong attribute which I use to know to which area a given element belongs and I want to use this attribute also to determine how many rows each of the three tableView sections shall have if the number of elements of a section is 0 the section shall appear empty while the others filled with the matching elements. Im using the following code to do this, but its not working at all as you can see theres an ifelse ifelse control structure inside my numberOfRowsInSection method, but the result of the operation I do inside each condition is always null. Whats strange to me is that if I do any of those operations outside of the control structure the result is exactly what it is supposed to be It gives me the right number of rows of course this is the same for all the sections strongWhats wrong with itstrong Above the code youll find a bonus question D.p  precode NSIntegertableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersection       if searching              NSPredicate grammarType             if section  1                  grammarType  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormattype  , Intermediate]                 [searchResults filterUsingPredicategrammarType]                 return [searchResults count]          else if section  2              grammarType  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormattype  , Advanced]             [searchResults filterUsingPredicategrammarType]             return [searchResults count]          else              grammarType  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormattype  , Basic]             [searchResults filterUsingPredicategrammarType]             return [searchResults count]                  If, instead, I use the following it works         grammarType  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormattype  , Basic]         [searchResults filterUsingPredicategrammarType]         return [searchResults count]      else          id ltNSFetchedResultsSectionInfogt sectionInfo  [[fetchedResultsController sections] objectAtIndexsection]         return [sectionInfo numberOfObjects]       codepre  pstrongBONUSstrong Ive noticed that the title headers for the sections, while searching meaning after I got the search results, dont scroll together with the table as usual, but stay fixed in their places.

Negative 1661 pNutshell I launch a thread from my form, then some time later use the Join method on it. It terminates but my application is stuck on the Join and refuses to acknowledge that its done joining. What would cause this to happen My thread is launched from a button on my form, and attempts to join from a second button on the same form.p  pMore Info I have an application that uses threading to accomplish communications and number crunching. Assuming the Main Form to be the parent thread, the first child is Child1. Upon starting Child1 establishes some communications with external devices and launches 2 child threads of its own Child2 and Child3 to process the incoming data.p  pWhen the user decides that the application is to stop processing incoming data I need Child1 to terminate so com settings can be altered prior to resuming, if necessary. I set a stop event and Child1 exits its execution loop, the first things it does is notify Child2 and Child3 that they are no longer needed via another stop event, Child2 and Child3 are waited for with the Join method within Child1. This works just fine.p  pWhat does not work is that the form also uses the Join method on Child1 after setting the stop event that prompted Child1 to exit its run loop and terminate, this Join, however, waits indefinitely.p  pStepping Through When I step through my app I notice that at the moment before using Join the IsAlive property is true. After I hit Child1.Join I can no longer get any information from the thread because its in JoinWaitSleep. However, if I run a while loop that causes the form thread to sleep while Child1.IsAlive is true, this works just fine. Is my second button somehow part of a thread that cannot join Child1 to itp  precode public void Run    Known as Child1     code to setup coms is here      Launch Builder threads     InsertBackgroundMonitorLaunching Collector Threads     RunBuilders  true      Known as Child2 and Child3     BuildThread1  new Threadnew ThreadStartCam1Builder     BuildThread2  new Threadnew ThreadStartCam2Builder     BuildThread1.Start     BuildThread2.Start      while StopEventHandle.WaitOne0, true           Code that waits for coms and tosses data into lists           RunBuilders  false      Wait for threads to terminate     BuildThread1.Join     BuildThread2.Join   private void RunButtonClickobject sender, System.EventArgs e      Button for running the control thread     ControlThread  new Threadnew ThreadStartRun     ControlThread.Start   private void StopButtonClickobject sender, System.EventArgs e      if btnStop.Enabled        Button for stopping the control thread         StopEventHandle.Set          if ControlThread  null                      while ControlThread.IsAlive                              Thread.Sleep100                          somehow Join did not work             ControlThread.Join                   Update buttons         btnStart.Enabled  true         btnStop.Enabled  false                     codepre

Negative 1661 pWe have a very strange issue that were dealing with.p  pWe have an MVC 3 application that we are still developing, and Monday we started running into an issue with four specific routes methods in one of our controllers.  All four of these routes are used in the management of roles and deal with either creating or editing a role.  We have two different tiers of roles in the application, so there are two routes for creating a role for each tier, and two routes for editing a role for each tier.  Both methods for the corresponding create routes call the same view, as well as the two methods for the corresponding edit routes.  Both views call a shared partial view that contains the form fields that correspond to the properties of the role being created or edited.p  pHeres the issue.  p  pIf I attempt to hit these routes without running the debugger first, IIS will hang.  It will not error out, throw an error, or even register the request in the IIS log.p  pHOWEVER, if I attempt to access those routes in the debugger, regardless of whether I have a breakpoint set up or not, the routes function as they should.p  pTo make life a little more interesting, if I attempt to access those same routes AFTER Ive run and shut down the debugger, the routes STILL function as they should.p  pWe can reproduce this behavior on EVERY machine on our development team AND our staging server except the debugging part on staging.p  pThe methods that correspond to all of these routes themselves rely on a couple of methods in the same web service in our middle tier.  Those methods work properly outside of the debugger in our integration tests.p  pWeve checked for endless loops in the code, but cant find anything that would create an endless loop under these conditions.  In fact, theres only one loop in the shared view, but its a for each loop which shouldnt ever result in an endless loop.p  pLastly, when I attempt to hit any of these four routes without running under the debugger or at least running it on a previous request, IIS essentially hangs.  It will not time out.  It will not throw an error.  It will not log an error to the IIS log.  Finally, it will eat up system resources the the point that you have to either restart IIS or reboot the entire machine.p  pHas anyone ever seen this behaviour before  Any ideas on how to get around it  Ive NEVER seen this behavior before, and the only thing that anyone in our development group could come up with was some sort of permissions issue on a file, but were not accessing the file system outside of the view files themselves, and they have proper permissions at any point during the processing of these methods.p  pIm open to any and all suggestions.p  h2strongUPDATE 1strongh2  pI have also posted this question on the ASP.NET forums and I had someone ask a question for more information.  Heres my response to their questions.p  blockquote   pWhat IIS are we talking aboutp blockquote  pIIS 7.5.  Were using the fullfledged IIS, not IIS Express.p  blockquote   pWhat errorp blockquote  pThats just it.  There is no error.  No error is being reported.  In fact, the request itself isnt being recorded in the IIS log for the site IF were attempting to access these routes without the debugger running.  If the debugger is running, everything works as you would expect it to.p  blockquote   pVS Cassinip blockquote  pNope.  IIS 7.5 that comes with Windows 7.p  blockquote   pIf you deploy on IIS a default WebForm project , does it worksp blockquote  pYes.  Without an issue.  I actually have a number of WebForms applications that I maintain for customers running on my development box.  They all work without any issue whatsoever.p  blockquote   pIf you deploy on IIS a default MVC project , does it worksp blockquote  pYes.  I have a number of sites running on this box.  All of these sites are running without a hitch.  IN FACT, the vast majority of routes on this site can be accessed without any issue.  The vast majority of routes strongWITHIN THIS VERY CONTROLLERstrong can be accessed without any issuep  pTo reiterate, this controller allows a user to manage users, roles, and permissions within the application.  We have methods in there for listing, creating, and updating users, roles, and permissions.  The routes that hit the methods for managing users and permissions work regardless of whether the debugger is running or not.  The ONLY routes giving us issues are the four routes that I described above.p  pWe currently have 19 controllers in this application, each with a varying number of defined route methods.  EVERY OTHER route defined for the application is working properly and is not exhibiting this behavior.  These are the only four methods routes in this one particular controller where we are seeing this.p  h2strongUPDATE 2strongh2  pIve narrowed this down to a REST call to a service that we control within the controller.  Heres the weird part  if I go into the REST service and immediately return a value dont process anything, it still hangs outside of the debugger.  If Im running inside of the debugger or immediately after running the debugger, everything works as it should.p  pIf I attempt to hit that REST service in fiddler directly, it works like a charm.p  pIm going to try changing the URL in the service contract for the web service Im calling and see if that works.  Maybe its something to do with the REST URL on the web service.p  h2strongUPDATE 3strongh2  pJust to add further confusion, I set up Fiddler to act as a proxy between my MVC application and the REST middle tier.  For EVERY other REST call within the application, the proxy gets the request.  For this particular REST call, the proxy NEVER gets the request.p  pNow heres the annoying part.  The WebChannelFactory that we use to call all of the methods in the middle tier through REST is created using a utility class in our MVC application.  This code is used to generate every channel, so theres no difference between the requests that populate the list of users and the one that populates the list of permissions the one thats hanging.p  pThis is a GET request thats hanging, so I was able to call it directly in the browser.  It works without an issue.  The issues doesnt appear to be on the service end, but somewhere in the MVC application.p

There are no issues whatsoever wrt the multimedia components of this app, the only issue I am facing now is that seeing that the smack api is not really suitable for mobile apps, i am now struggling to find a suitable api that will be able to be used crosplatform i.e. Symbian, J2ME, Android, Blackberry,iOS etc. Is there such an api If anybody knows please let me know.p  pThere are apis like the Android asmack that I have come across in my search, other alternatives were to get the smack api source and alter it to my needs. But so far I see my best bet is to write a xmpp proxy component on my server side using java together with netty that will receive connections from multiple clients and pass on the work to worker threads that implement the smack api and represent the client to the xmpp server and send responses back to the client. The proxy will use either Sockets or Http to receive connections from clients.p  pAny thoughts around what I am planning  p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1661 ptldr I am looking for an elegant method of doing internationalization in Jade templates. Essentially the problem boils down to that I have to do interpolation on strings in variables, instead of verbatim code.p  pProblem details p  pIn a monolingual Jade template I can just make an element with embedded tags and variables like sop  precodep Posted by    span.author post.author    on   span.date post.author codepre  pto get something like p  precodeltpgtPosted by ltspan styleauthorgtThe Authorltspangt on  ltspan styledategt20120308ltspangtltpgt codepre  pBut when I want to internationalize this, I need a single string, since word order is not the same in every language. Also, I would like to hide html details from translators, and just give them a line like thisp  precodePosted by author on date codepre  pNow when I pass the i18ned version of this string to the Jade template as i18n.postedbyon, it wont do interpolation on it, so the best I can do isp  precode var author  ltspan classauthorgtltspangt.replace,post.author   var date  ltspan classdategtltspangt.replace,post.date  var header  i18n.postedbyon       .replaceauthor,author       .replacedate,date  p header codepre  pThis mostly defeats the point of the nice Jade templating, as I have to do all the interpolation manually.

Negative 1661 pIt was as hard to write a good title for this issue as it was to search the web for it.p  pI have a lot of projects, some are in maintenance they have been productive for years and others in active development. This is an important fact because the problem happens on all projects on my computer and not on others.p  pThe problem is that I run all web projects on tomcat and they all have database connections. I always used the Terminate button in favor of the Stop button to restart or stop tomcat from eclipse. p  pFor those who dont know, the terminate button is the red button that stops the app from the log console or the debug console, while the stop button is the same red button but on the servers console. p  pIt is a lot faster to stop the servers from the terminate button rather then the stop button, the problem is that ever since I upgraded to Helios my database connections no longer closed when terminating the servers... they do when stopping them normally.p  pWell no need to say that I discovered this because the database servers Oracle, MySQL and SQLServer started giving Too many connections errors.p  pThis is a huge head scratcher for me since code has nothing to do with this issue, different types of database management in different projects have the same problem, only on my machine Yes I havee tried this on other computers and the problem does not occur.p  pI have tried everything I could think of short from formatting...p  ul liUpgraded to Indigoli liReinstalled Galileo even downloaded a fresh copyli liReinstalled and tried different databasesli liTried different versions of Tomcat 6 and 7li ul  pI am starting to think it might not be an IDE problem and it just happened to start when I upgraded eclipse.p  pANY suggestions are welcomep

Negative 1661 pA collection knows its models, but is there a way for the model to get to its collectionp  pI would need a way to get to the adjacent models in a collection. The following may give a better idea of the problemp  pIm trying to implement a simple app that ranks items based on an priority attribute in the model and maintains a list of them. Each model view has buttons for increasing or decreasing the priority, which should alter the ordering of the list accordingly. Simply adding or subtracting one from the current value will work as long as the priorityattributes are continuous, for examplep  precode1,2,3,4,5,6 codepre  pBut there is also a delete button, which allows deleting any model from the list. It can lead to priorityattributes likep  precode1,2,5,6 codepre  pNow changing the priority of 5 to 4 wont change the order of the list as its still greater than 2.p

Negative 1661 pIm new to HTML5CanvasGame programming, but have been tinkering around with it after reading a couple of books. I THINK I have a fairly good idea of how things work out. This question asks several smaller questions, but in general is basically a structural approach question. Im not expecting verbose responses, but hopefully small pointers here and there  Here is a link to a nonscrolling, and currently rather boring Super Mario World. p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netCrusader12m6ur39Super Mario World Testap  pstrongNOTE Controls are LeftRight and Spacebar to jump. This is only setup for Firefox right now as Im just learning.strongp  hr  h2Did I Do Something Wrong at This Pointh2  pCurrently Ive just focused on how Mario runs and jumps, and think that Ive gotten it down fairly okay. The coin box doesnt do anything and the background is just an image loaded in for looks. Heres my approach, please let me know if there is anything entirely wrong with thisp  ul liAllows Mario to jump by enacting on 2 Y velocities Gravity and Jump variablesli liAllows Mario to run by enacting on 1 velocity Left or Right Friction  Accelerationli liSprites are used and positioned according to keypresskeydownli liIm not sure if this is right, but Im using a constructor function to build an object, then inside the main animation loop Im calling the prototype.draw function for that object to update all variables and redraw the object.li liIm clearing the entire canvas each Frameli liShould I be splitting this into more than just a draw function, like Mario.moveli liIve setup a GroundLevel and a JumpLevel variable to create 2 planes of gameplay. The JumpLevel is setup to allow for controlling how high Mario can jump on the fly. The 2 places would allow for the ground to rise like a hill  keeping the point at which Gravity overrules Marios jumping force at the same distance from the ground.li liFor clarity sake, everything is separated into different JS files, but would obviously consolidate.li ul  hr  h2Moving Forwardh2  pNow that Ive finished setting up how Mario moves around I think there are a couple other minor things I might do like mushroom updown and shooting fireballs. I think I can figure that out, but Im really lost when it comes to visualizing the following and how HTML5Canvas can handle this easilyp  ul lipScrolling background Ive tried setting up Ground Tiles and using Screen Wrapping, but that seems to cause a lot of uneven issues since I was moving the tiles in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, since Im trying to account for acceleration, this threw off the count and was causing gaps in the ground. I ditched this idea. Would a DIV beneath the canvas with a large background image be the best solutionpli lipEnemies Would I create enemies the same way and run a loop for collision detection on every enemy during each framepli lipBackground Boxes Im trying to allow Mario to stand on the boxes in the background, but am unsure how to approach this. I currently have boundaries setup for Mario to stay on the canvas, do I continue to expand these conditions to setup different boundaries based on the boxes I can see that having several boxes on the screen and doing it this way would get kind of crazy, especially if I would be doing the same hit testing for enemies I know Im missing something here....pli lipLevel Movement This is somewhat related. When the Right key is pressed, basically everything in the level needs to move to the left. Would I need to track out all positions of everything that could touch Mario boxes for him to stand on and enemies for him to collide with during every animation frame This seems like it would get kind of inefficient pli ul  pThanks to all Ill keep this updated with resultssolutions p

Negative 1661 pI am in the process of migrating my android app from C2DM to GCM. I have the serverside setup to receive both with an indication of the IDs that are GCM vs C2DM, and then on the server side I send out via the appropriate service depending on the service it is registered for.p  pThe problem that I have run into is that the app is registering with my server as GCM with the app update to use the new sender id in the intent. However unfortunately the ID that it passes to the server for a registration id is actually the old C2DM ID.p  pIs there something I need to be doing as part of this migration in the app code to make sure I get a new GCM ID rather than continuing to use the existing C2DM registration id. This is easy for me to test and reproduce and I get consistent results every time MisMatchedSenderId from GCM server. Do I need to first unregister the C2DM idp

Negative 1661 pThe site currently does mainly range searches latitude amp longitude with some filtering like codeWHERE color  redcode type of clauses. However using MySQL with geospatial index is still quite slow and I need to speed it up.p  pstrongProblemstrong Will using Solr to do the search be a good idea p  pIf so, should I only duplicate the range columns from MySQL into Solr, and do the codeWHEREcode clauses in MySQL, or do both type of queries in Solrp  pIve read that Solr is not for storing data like a database ie. MySQL. Does this mean that if my search can take place over 10 different columns or codefieldcode in Solr terms, and the MySQL table that I replicated Solrs from only has 11 tables, I would still keep the MySQL table even though that will use up almost twice as much storage space half of which is redundantp  pIt appears that Im using structured data because each row has many columns defined and storing the entire table in Solr instead having redundant data on MySQL and Solr will save storage space and number of database access operations when writing. Is Solr a good choice herep  pIn terms of speed, would it be better to use PostGIS or Solrp

If I use HttpWebRequest.BeginGetResponse to wait for the async result and trigger an complete event to update the UI, I need to use invoke method to call the UI thread control, but can I use background  worker instead of  I can just simply change the UI in RunWorkerCompleted event, are there any disadvantage pli ol  pSorry for my pool English and thanks for help...p
Negative 1661 pI have a google app engine application which needs to be given a publicprivate key pair. I dont want to check this into source control because it will be accessible by too many people. Since this is GAE I cant use the build system to write the keys to the file system of the server.p  pIs there a known best practice for this  My first thought was does Jenkins provide a way to manage keys securely I know I can just copy the keys to a location on the jenkins server and copy them into the build but this project will be used by third party teams so I need to provide a UI based solution in jenkins. I did not find any relevant plugin but I would like to make sure there isnt a better way before writing my own. p

Negative 1661 pIm working through the Railscast on implementing Devise and OmniAuth along with the Devise a hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevisewikiOmniAuth3AOverviewdocumentationa  currently, Ive got a site going where visitors can sign up using their facebook accounts or by filling out a form.p  pIm running into trouble when users that sign up via OmniAuth try to edit their profiles, though. Devise looks for the users current password when they submit changes to their profiles, but those that logged in with facebook dont know their passwords theyre set automatically in the user modelp  precode  def self.findforfacebookoauthauth, signedinresourcenil     user  User.whereprovider gt auth.provider, uid gt auth.uid.first     unless user       user  User.createfirstnameauth.extra.rawinfo.firstname,                          lastnameauth.extra.rawinfo.lastname,                            providerauth.provider,                            uidauth.uid,                            emailauth.info.email,                            passwordDevise.friendlytoken[0,20]                                 end     user   end codepre  pWhen a user edits his information, the app should not require password confirmation if he set up his account through OmniAuth. The tutorial suggests that the handy passwordrequired method will help me achieve this outcome. Specifically, adding this method to the user model means that it should only return true if the user didnt sign up through OmniAuth the provider attribute would be nil in that casep  precodedef passwordrequired   super ampamp provider.blank end codepre  pThus, a piece of code like p  precodelt formforresource, as gt resourcename, url gt registrationpathresourcename, html gt  method gt put  do f gt   lt deviseerrormessages gt     lt render partial gt essentialuserinfoinputs, locals gt  f gt f  gt     lt render partial gt inessentialuserinfoinputs, locals gt  f gt f  gt     lt if f.object.passwordrequired gt          lt render partial gt passwordinputs, locals gt  f gt f  gt         lt f.label currentpassword gt ltigtwe need your current password to confirm your changesltigtltbr gt         lt f.passwordfield currentpassword gt     lt end gt   lt f.submit Update gt lt end gt codepre  pwould theoretically only display password inputs when needed. It also suggests that Devise has built in logic saying that OmniAuth users dont need to use passwords to edit their accounts. I have no idea if this is true, but the tutorial kind of makes it look like that. But when an OmniAuth user tries to edit his account, I get Current password cant be blank. Same thing with nonOmniAuth users this makes sense, since the password fields dont show up on those users edit pages either.p  pSome poking around confirms that the passwordrequired method is returning false, both when the user signed up through OmniAuth and through the sites regular user signup. Even when I change it to simply run the superclass method, it returns false. p  pAny ideas of whats going on with the passwordrequired method I cant find anything about it anywhere, but I feel like thats whats tripping things up right now.p  h3Updateh3  pThis is now working, but not using the method outlined in the Railscast, which relies on requirespassword method, a topic that I still know nothing about. Instead, I implemented the solution outlined a hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevisewikiHowToAllowuserstoedittheiraccountwithoutprovidingapasswordherea, as suggested a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13436232editinguserswithdeviseandomniauthcomment1836887413436232herea.

What status code should we returnp  precode   201 Created No resource    200 Successful but without the resource.     500 Internal Server Error codepre  pSomething elsep  pI guess its fairly a common scenario.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI want to clarify this.  First thing, its all ONE POST call to create a resource. The response should be code200code with the resource object as JSON. But there is an error strongonlystrong during the retrieval of the resource the resource was created successfully. p  pThe reasons for failure to get the resource form the database might be intermittent and might be server  network related and could be identified and fixed later.

I understand it is some kind of really big number, but the problem is, my verts arent anywhere near the position that number indicates I have seen this happen with a 1m1m1m box. I have found that when it happens with a mesh, it always happens with that mesh and with the same vertex, untill I move that specific vertex scalingmoving the whole thing doesnt work. I use this code to export the vertex positions  p  precodenumverts   selmesh.numverts for i1 to numverts do    v  getVert selmesh i   format v n v tooutfile  format n tooutfile codepre  pI have tried Googling the problem, but no one seems to have the same issue. I use the same code for my tvertices and those are exported perfectly fine. I can post the whole exporter if neccesary. Please let me know if you need to see more code .p
Negative 1661 pWhat is the name of the USB class which handles communication with USB devices which appear as COM ports in Windows device manager For linux at least for Fedora 17 and Ubuntu 12.04 these ports appear as ACM Abstract Control Model, devttyACM.p  pI understand that historically, serial communication was primarily done through the RS232 serial port which is now deprecated. I believe that todays standard is to communicate through USB using HID.p  pA google search for ACM reveals that it is part of CDC Communications Device Class which is a USB communication class opposite of HID i.e. a USB device may use HID or CDC. a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiUSBcommunicationsdeviceclassThis wikipedia articlea reveals that CDCACM is a method of emulating RS232 communication over USB.p  pWith this information, shouldnt this form of serial communication be called CDC or CDCACM  p

Negative 1661 pSo Im doing some exam review problems, and one of them states In UNIX system V, the length of a block is 1 KB and each block can hold a total of 256 block addresses.  Using the inode scheme, what is the maximum size of the filep  pNow the irony here is the professors provided solutions, and I understand the mathlogic behind single, double, and triple indirect allocation, its the direct allocation thats messing me up.p  pAccording to the solution, the direct allocation scheme uses 10 blocks, because 210 bytes  1 KB.  Why  Whats the reasoning behind this formula  Is is just some arbitrary number the inventors of the UNIX System V inode dreamed up  Because it makes no sense to me to have 10 pointers for 1024 byes, as 102410  one address every 102.4 bytes, would be much more logical to have 8 or some other number.p  pThe professors hinted there may very well be a question like this on our final, and Id rather not risk using a cookiecutter formula I dont understand.p

Negative 1661 pIm trying to build a chess game in C.  p  pI have a base class gamePiece and a derived class rook.  My original idea was to create a vector of gamePiece objects and insert all of the different types of gamePieces rooks, queens, pawns inside there.  As I found out in my last question, I cant do that  the gamePiece vector only takes base class i.e. gamePiece objects.p  pHowever, smart pointers and other techniques were suggested.  I will try that soon.p  pBut Im still curious as to why the technique below wont work. What if I instead create a vector of pointers to gamePieces, and then attempt to store pointers to my derived objects inside that vectorp  precodevectorltgamePiece gt vectorOfPointersToGamePieces   vectorltgamePiece gtiterator itOfPointersToGamePieces codepre  pFor example, suppose I insert a pointer to a rook object inside the above vector at the first location.  Initially what I thought might work was this strategyp  precodevectorOfPointersToGamePieces.pushback amprook1, Rook, A, 1, White, Up    itOfPointersToGamePiecesvectorOfPointersToGamePieces.begin       itOfPointersToGamePieces.displayPieceInfo codepre  pThe constructors appear to run fine, everything initializes.  But when it comes time to display the values of the data members onscreen with cout, the variables appear to be emptyunitialized.  Its like they disappeared.    p  pMy second crack at it was to try to dynamically cast the rook pointer to a gamepiece pointer before inserting it in the vector, like this.p  precodevectorOfPointersToGamePieces.pushback dynamiccast ltgamePiece gt amprook1, Rook, A, 1, White, Up     codepre  pBut that yielded the exact same output as above.  EmptyUnitialized variables.p  pOn my third attempt, I took a step back and tried a simpler operation.  Here, I tried to insert a pointer to a gamePiece in the vector instead of a pointer to a rook.p  precodevectorOfPointersToGamePieces.pushback ampgamePiece1, Rook, A, 1, White, Up  codepre  pThere were issues with even this third operation Only some the variables I initialized in the constructor were retained when I attempted the display operation  p  precodeitOfPointersToGamePiecesvectorOfPointersToGamePieces.begin     itOfPointersToGamePieces.displayPieceInfo codepre  pMore specifically, the ints, and the char were retained and displayed properly.  But the strings were empty and disappeared.p  pAnyone have any ideas as to why my strategy isnt workingp

Negative 1661 pFirst question posted to Stack Overflow but have spent many hours reading answers here .p  pIm creating a Heroku Python app and am using responsive design media queries in my css.  I deploy my app to Heroku and visit emmyherokuappem.herokuapp.com. Website looks fine on laptop browser...responsive design elements working as well.  Visiting the same url on my iPhone, however, seems to show a page where one of my css files the media queries is loading but the other the main css file is not.  p  pDoes Heroku cache css files  I read somewhere that you have to host static files elsewhere if you have a Django app, but not sure if thats applicable to me.

Does that have anything to do with itp  pEdit Does anyone know how to run the equivalent of the FirefoxGoogle Inspector on mobile  That would really help me figure out what files are there and what arent.p

Negative 1661 pWell, I have basically two questions regarding screen resolution in iOS devices.p  p1 In iOS documentation, on the Point vs Pixels section, it states the coordinates are passed in to framework as points, and that One point does not necessarily correspond to one pixel on the screen. as found here a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationWindowsViewsConceptualViewPGiPhoneOSWindowsandViewsWindowsandViews.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationWindowsViewsConceptualViewPGiPhoneOSWindowsandViewsWindowsandViews.htmla p  pWhen they are different Up until now I was assuming they were equal and passing in pixel coordinates. Is this a parameter that changes from device to devicep  p2 Im also a little bit confused about PPI. I know what it means on the hardware screen if a 10 and a 7 display have the same pixel resolution then the 7 display will have a better image quality since the PPI is higher. But what difference it makes if I save a .png with 72ppi or 96 or even 326 Is it just for printing or does it make any difference visually on my screenp  pThanksp

Negative 1661 pAt a Java interview it was asked with a context to threads that there is a class ABC consists of two static synchronized methods  codem1code and codem2code, and there is two threads codeT1code, codeT2code, if codeT1code takes a lock on method codem1code then at the same time is it possible for codeT2code to take lock on codem2code method, I replied that since codem1code and codem2code are static synchronized so they are having class level lock so if codeT1code thread takes the lock on codem1code method then no other thread could take a lock on codem1code at the same time until codeT1code releases the lock from codem1code method but at the same time thread codeT2code can take lock on method codem2code, please advise it is correct. p

Negative 1661 pI have a FFT algorithm in C and I generate sine wave in a buffer at a frequency of 440, FS1600 and Window length of 2048.p  pBefore sending the signal to the FFT, I double the window length and put imaginary values 0es between buffer data.

Negative 1661 pI am working on a project in which an enterprise archive ear deployed on a JBoss server needs to compile and run a class dynamically. I am using the JavaCompiler class to do this  the complication comes from the fact that the class being compiled has references to some of the classes contained within the ejb jar within the ear.p  pThis is not a problem when the deployed ear is exploded on deployment, so it is just a directory rather than an archive  in this case I am able to specify the required jar in the classpath option of the compiler, and compilation works fine. Unfortunately due to constraints of the systems I am working with, it is not an acceptable solution to deploy these ears exploded, and the compiler seems not to be able to see the required jar when its wrapped up in an archive.p  pGiven that the dynamic compilation is taking place from the ear in question, and therefore the systems class loader has access to the contents of the required jar, is there any way I can tell the compiler to just use the classes as loaded by the system class loaderp  pI appreciate this is something of a wordy question, but any help would be appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 1661 pI have the following problem. I use a form when I provide only PIN. I have validator which checks if its a 4digit number.

Previously it was null so there was no message there.

Picture the master branch with tags at 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.4.1, 7.4.2, 7.8, 8.2, and the most current 8.3p  pIn production for a specific client is version 7.2, and a bug is found and must be fixed.p  pFixing it in 8.3.1 and moving the client from 7.2 to 8.3.1 is unacceptable to the client.p  pSo, is there a recommended workflow for this p  pI could create a fork of the master branch from the 7.2 tag, call this branch release7.2.x Then, treat release7.2.x like one treats the master branch  create from the baseline a feature branch 72bug, fix the bug, etc, and ultimately merge the feature branch into release7.2.x, do a build, make a 7.2.1 tag, and put it into production. release7.2.x would then live on forever, as does the master, so that any more fixes to 7.2.x can be made on release7.2.x.p  pOf course, one doesnt want to lose the fix from 7.2 for the current work, so one could create a feature branch from the current master baseline 8.3 and merge the bug branch 72bug into this feature branch. This feature branch would be treated like any other feature for the current release cyclesprint. Thus, at the end of the cycle the newest baseline 8.4 would contain the bug fix.p  pHow have others using Adams workflow addressed this situation p

Negative 1661 pI am trying to learn about socket programming as well as the WebSocket protocol. I know that there are python web socket clients in existence but I am hoping to just build a toy version for my own learning. To do this I have created an extremely simple Tornado websocket server that I am running on codelocalhost8888code. All it does is print a message when a client connects.p  pThis is the entire server  and it works I have tested it with a small javascript script in my browserp  precodeimport tornado.httpserver import tornado.websocket import tornado.ioloop import tornado.web   class WSHandlertornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler     def openself         printnew connection         self.writemessageHello World      def onmessageself, message         printmessage received s  message      def oncloseself       printconnection closed  application  tornado.web.Application[     rws, WSHandler, ]   if name  main     httpserver  tornado.httpserver.HTTPServerapplication     httpserver.listen8888     tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance.start codepre  pSo once I start up the server I try to run the following scriptp  precodeimport socket  sock  socket.socketsocket.AFINET, socket.SOCKSTREAM sock.connectsocket.gethostbynamelocalhost, 8888  msg  GET chat HTTP1.1 Host server.example.com Upgrade websocket Connection Upgrade SecWebSocketKey dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ Origin httpexample.com SecWebSocketProtocol chat, superchat SecWebSocketVersion 13.encodeascii printlenmsg  sentcount  sock.sendmsg printsent this many bytes, sentcount recvvalue  sock.recv1 printrecvieved, recvvalue codepre  pWhat I am hoping is that the server will send back the response header as specified in the RFC. Instead the sock.recv is hanging. This leads me to believe the server isnt acknowledging the websocket initial handshake. This handshake is pulled off of the RFC as well. I know that the websocket key should be random and everything, but I dont think that would cause the server to ignore the handshake the websocket key is valid.

For now its possible to use it only when a printer get PCL4 and my team is worried about future printers where PCL4 may not be acceptable anymore. The previous developer did quite an effort in trying to use PCL6 with Builders component with no success. To be more specific, the error report from previous team members is   p  blockquote   pThe Builder component doesnt work  well with printers using PCL6. It doesnt respect the Fonts orientations, some things become disoriented in the window.p blockquote  pMy question is which is the best way to solve this problem Particularly Ild be happy to find a patch or something from Borland making TPrinter compatible with PCL6, but other solutions may be welcomed. Ild like to avoid having to create my own component or a particular printer class. Changing the IDE is not a viable solution, but including a compatible library is fine.p  pIm glad for any help.p  pMomergilp
Negative 1661 pI apologise firstly and foremost if I have put this in the wrong place. But I believe this to be an inherent programming design decision, hence why it is here.p  pI am working on an android game which has various classes that are related via inheritance.p  pI have a Coin object, and a Die object as in a single Dice, the Die object has another subclass, CustomDie which allows a user to define a die with many faces, i.e. 7 sided dice.p  pSince both the coin and die have very similar functions, the coin picks a random number between 1 and 2, and the die does that between 1 and 6 and the custom die does this between n,m or whatever range the user has defined. I was thinking about putting some of the functionality in a parent class.p  pI am not sure what the class would be called, perhaps something along the lines of RandomGenerator or RandomPicker. Any suggests would be welcome.p  pI agree that most of the answers will be based on opinions, but there is a degree of knowledge required, i.e. use of verbsnouns to pick a good class name. This will later affect the choice of method names and other classesvariables used in the project. And good software architects will converge on one or two of the best suggestions, so please dont write the question off as one that cannot be answered.p

Negative 1661 pIm using a third party component in my application that is distributed either as a COM component, or can be referenced using a .manifest file. Either way it is loaded using CoCreateInstance. The files needed for the third party component reside in a subfolder. The component developer told me to include a .manifest file in the Visual Studio 2010 settings in the Manifest section of the executable, and loading the component works without problems.p  pNow Im using the third party component from a DLL only, to encapsulate the features used from the third party component. Im loading the DLL dynamically, using LoadLibrary. Using the component still works, I can use the component from within the DLL that is loaded by the EXE that has the manifest file referenced.p  pTo further separate the EXE from the third pary component, Id like to move the manifest to the DLL, too, where is the only place the component is used. In this way every new EXE Id like to write can use the DLL and indirectly use the features. For now, I have to add the mainfest to every new EXE, but I dont want to do that.p  pIs there a way to move the manifest used by the EXE to a DLLp

Negative 1661 pI am trying to use Selenium WebDriver to automate a mobile web app my team is creating for our company using JQuery.

Negative 1661 pI have a View with an imageView and collectionView. ImageView is in the left top corner of screen with size 150,250.CollectionView is fullscreen. Cell of collectionView has label inside it.p  pWhen the cell is near the imageView, it should have smaller width. When the cell is lower then imageView, it should be  on full width.

My friend suggested a 2d array.p  pHere is the print function that gives me the error that actually causes a break in the programp  precodeconst vectorltvectorltchargtgtamp  Boardgetboard  for int i  0 i lt 16 i      letters.insertletters.begin, 1, randomletter   uppercaseletters randomshuffleletters.begin, letters.end  int counter  0 for sizet i  0 i lt 4 i     for sizet j  0 j lt 4 j              board[0].pushbackletters[counter]        codepre  pI keep getting the array to fill the first row, but then it throws an exception. Im not sure what the exception is, but when I try to move forward, it tells me the code exited with exception 0 and points to the board[][] line in the print method. I dont think the second vector is being filled. How can I do this Should I make another temp vector, or use a pair method I tried the pair method before without much success.p  pI just changed the 0 to i and indeed, that solved the issue. Thanks I think that I was thinking the vector would just push to the front counter number of times, not that we had 2 dimensions where the board[i] set the row. Thanks again. Silly error. p
Negative 1661 pI have a dataset that Im performing stepwise regression on, with cross validation.. I originally performed multiple linear regression with cross validation, and was able to see how close the values were for my test set to my training set for each fold I used the value to then plot a graph in which I measured the performance.

I performed the following algorithm in Rp  precodetest lt CV.SuperLearnerY,X, V  10, SL.library  SL.library, verbose  TRUE, method  method.NNLS codepre  pbut I cant see how Im able to look at the values from each fold and how close they were.

Negative 1661 pIt looks like Im missing some basics here. Sorry, If question may seem trivial, but Im loosing my wits looking for any cause of that, with no luck for hours now.p  pstrongIt seems like including more than one file in already included file is causing some minor change to the page layout.strong For this very simple example it just shifts first line a bit like a spacecharacter sign is added, but for my more complex site this flaw behaves like a line break and it puts whole website for a line down breaking my websites style. p  pHeres example. I have ubersimple main PHP codefileincludetest.phpcodep  precodeltphp require .file.phpgt ltdoctype htmlgt lthtmlgt     ltheadgtltheadgt     ltbodygt         This is a first line of html body.ltbrgt         This is a second line of html body.ltbrgt         This is a third...ltbrgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThen required file  file.php, looks like thisp  precodeltphp     requireoncefile2.php      requireoncefile3.php  gt codepre  pAnd then both required file above file2.php and file3.php. It seems irrelevant here, as I can put any content there with no change, but either way they are such super simple php files  p  pfile2.phpp  precodeltphp     function alfa         return 1      gt codepre  pfile3.phpp  precodeltphp     function omega         return 1      gt codepre  pNow please look at the output of main includetest.php herep  pa hrefhttpdestadesign.comtagincludetest.php relnofollowhttpdestadesign.comtagincludetest.phpap  pNotice the slight shift of the start of the body content strongWhat is causing thisstrongp  pNote Ive worked out that removing any of the require statements fix this out.  Remove second require statement of file.php requireoncefile3.php  fixed.  Remove first require statement of file.php requireoncefile2.php  fixed. Remove require statement of includetest.php requirefile.php  fixed.p  pConclusion however weird seems that two require statements or include  as Ive checked that too  or includeonce, or requireonce too in the same file which is also included outputs some invisible, unexpected and unjustified character. strongNow is it correct or am I missing something obvious here strongp

Negative 1661 pcould someone please tell me how to edit a script in AutoHotkeyp  pI use a macro recorder, to perform several repetitive tasks, i.e. MOVE UP n MOVE DOWN many times, so I use to press the macro shortcut repeatedly. The issue is that in the macro recorder that I use if you asign a shorcut with a modifier to call a macro i.e Shift A, then you must release the modifier each time you want to perform the macro, so I usually have to press Shift, press A, release Shift and release A, each time I want to call the macro, instead of just press Shift, hold it, and then press and release A many times. wich is easier. I I am looking for an AutoHotKey script that could solve this issue, I have lots of this macros, so I can not create a bat or exe file for each one, I basically need  a AutoHotkey script likep  pif keystate, SHIFT, P a send Shift down send a down send Shift up send a upp  por any other script that could send the Shift and A keys every time I press A but only if the Shift key is pressed.p  pI have been trying with loops, but I just dont know how to make it stop. THanks in advance.p  pConsider that I need not to be obliged to release and press again Shift  a everytime I want to call a macro, but also Alt  a, and also Alt  Win  a, each different combination call different macros. So it will be bad idea to set the a key to be always Shift  a, because I need the a key to perform different macros according to which other modifier keys are pressed at same time. Thanks Advanced.p  pThe list of hotkeys that I use in this application are everyone do something different, and it can not be replaced by any other hotkeyp  precodeAlt  A Shift  A Win  A Alt  Shift  A Win  Alt  A codepre  pand so on with most of the letters S, D, Q, W, E,etc and mubers 1, 2, 3,etc alsop  precodeShift  Tab Win  Tab Alt  Capslock Win  Alt  Capslock codepre  pIts really anoying to got to release Shift and Tab, and press them both again, each time I want to run a macro, I run this macro many times repetitively I think those are all the hotkeys, they all do different things that I run repetitively everytime.p  pPlease, I do need a script that would launch different actions pressing the same a key according to which other modifier keys are pressed at same time. Thanks Advanced. I am very grateful.p  pHi Robert, I didnt understand quite well what you said, but I edited the script like thisp  precodeMaxThreadsPerHotkey 2  SingleInstance Force installKeybdHook Persistent AppNameMyKeys Menu, Tray, Tip, AppName Menu, Tray, Icon , Shell32.dll, 45, 1  45, 28, 113, 74, 134 TrayTip, AppName, Started, 1    a GoSub, MyGetKeyStateSub If MyGetKeyStateValue0      SendInput, a  Else      if MyGetKeyStateValue amp 1 gt 0  Compare first bit         send LAlt down         send d down         send LAlt up         send d up     if MyGetKeyStateValue amp 10 gt 0  compare second bit         MsgBox, RShift     if MyGetKeyStateValue amp 100 gt 0  compare third bit         send LAlt down             send d down         send LAlt up         send d up     if MyGetKeyStateValue amp 1000 gt 0         MsgBox, RShift     if MyGetKeyStateValue amp 10000 gt 0         MsgBox, LAlt     if MyGetKeyStateValue amp 100000 gt 0         MsgBox, RAlt     if MyGetKeyStateValue amp 1000000 gt 0         MsgBox, LWin     if MyGetKeyStateValue amp 10000000 gt 0         MsgBox, RWin     if  MyGetKeyStateValue amp 00000011 gt 0  If LCtrl AND LShift pressed         MsgBox, LCtrl AND LShift  Return   MyGetKeyStateSub MyGetKeyStateValue0 if getkeystateLCtrl, P     MyGetKeyStateValue1  set least significant bit if getkeystateRCtrl, P     MyGetKeyStateValue2  set 2nd least significant bit, etc, etc. if getkeystateLShift, P     MyGetKeyStateValue4 if getkeystateRShift, P     MyGetKeyStateValue8 if getkeystateLalt, P     MyGetKeyStateValue16 if getkeystateRalt, P     MyGetKeyStateValue32 if getkeystateLWin, P     MyGetKeyStateValue64 if getkeystateRWin, P     MyGetKeyStateValue128 Return    d GoSub, MyGetKeyStateSub If MyGetKeyStateValue0      SendInput, d  Else      if MyGetKeyStateValue  1  LAlt              SendInput, LAlt DowndLAlt Up         Return          if MyGetKeyStateValue  4  LWin              SendInput, LAlt DownLWin DowndLAlt UpLWin Up         Return       Return codepre  pand open the program, and the same it dident work, first time I press Alt D I get the macro, second time I press D holding the alt key, I get a plain D.p  pI was thinking about what you said relative to the XY problem, perhaps I should rebuild all my macros from HK4 Hot Keyboard Pro 4 to AutoHotkey. There are lots of macros that I created with the help of the HK4 GUI, but the macros themselves are stored inside an xml script file, I opened this file once with a text editor and its huge, How much time could take me to script all these macros inside AHK I have set like 25 variables that apply to every macro like 200 macros mostly are mouse movements, mouse clicks, copy selected text number values from floating windows inside an application, apply arithmetic operation to them and pasting the results inside the same boxes again HK4 has and option that play keys, because otherwise it cant not paste inside the application, runing depending on which softwares, which floating windows names, and which variables are enabled or disable inverted condition, also have toggles macros that toggle between two macros with one hotkey, I mean, how much it will take me to learn how to script all those kind of macros inside AHK, I looked on internet, but its very hard to understand each posted case that do not apply exactly to what I intend to do, THanks Robert, what do you suggest me I mean, I would rebuild all my macros in AHK because inside AHK I do not have to release the modifier key to perform a macro many times simultaneously, What about Autoit its easier to learn I read it had macrorecorder Thanks.p

Negative 1661 pI dont understand why, in a for loop, using an int  if its initialised as 0 and you set the loop to increment the int for integer less than a figure  if you output the integer each time the loop executes  it doesnt go up to the figure you told it to increment up to in the for loop.p  pI might not be phrasing myself very clearly here to best help you understand so please see the following link by way of an examplep  pa hrefhttpcodepad.orgdoPC6kuI relnofollowhttpcodepad.orgdoPC6kuIap  pThe output in the link is 0,1,2,3,4  I realise its 5 ints but int i begins at 0 but is incremented before the output so I dont understand why the first output is 0 and not 1 making it 1,2,3,4,5.p  pIts annoying me that I cant rationalise this or come up with a logical explanation.p

Negative 1661 pI have an Android app for Google Glass that communicates with an external device using Bluetooth. The device sends a short command and receives an acknowledgement. There were no perceptible delays when I used Glass XE11, but I noticed significant delays once I upgraded to XE12. Digging deeper, I found that the round trip for the command is in the order of 80 ms on an Android phone and 250500 ms on Glass XE12. The code that I use is based on the BluetoothChat sample code.p  pWere there any changes to the way Google Glass handles Bluetooth communication between XE11 and XE12 that could explain these delays Do you have any suggestions to reduce the delays Thanks in advancep

Negative 1661 pFrom what I understand of the way Backbone.js is intended to be used, Views are supposed to be rendered in their own codeelcode element, which is not necessarily attached to the page. If it is so, the higher level view they depend on usually takes care of inserting the codeelcode in the page.p  pI am making this statement after having read the a hrefhttpbackbonejs.orgdocstodos.html relnofollowTodo sample applicationa. In this case, the TodoView renders element in a default codedivcode element that is not attached to the page. p  precodevar TodoView  Backbone.View.extend    [...]   render function      this.el.htmlthis.templatethis.model.toJSON     this.el.toggleClassdone, this.model.getdone     this.input  this..edit     return this   , codepre  pThe AppView, upon a Todo creation, takes care of creating the TodoView and appending its codeelcode to the page after rendering.p  precodevar AppView  Backbone.View.extend    [...]   addOne functiontodo      var view  new TodoViewmodel todo     this.todolist.appendview.render.el   , codepre  hr  pMy question is If a view not attached to the page needs adjustments strongafterstrong being inserted e.g. calculating its position in the viewport and performing DOM manipulation accordingly, where would you place the corresponding codep  pWould you create a codeafterInsertioncode method that the sublevel View should call after inserting, would you put the code at the same emplacement that where the insertion takes place i.e. in the sublevel View or would you change the way the view works to have it rendering directly in the page Im sure there are other solutions I cant think of right now. I would like to know what you consider being a best practiceoptimized in the way Backbone should work, or if this question doesnt make sense to explain why.p

Negative 1661 pI would like to ask a small help because I can not handle with overlay a div with background. In my website there are welcome section which is 100 width and 100 height, it has a background image which is covered a small texture pattern and rgba color. It works correct but I have a problem with other section which can not be covered by overlay.p  pThe problem is with strongCTA sectionstrong because it use padding top and bottom. Unfortunately, the whole background of this section is not covered and generally I do not know how I can fix it very simple. I would not use const height property because I want to create something which will match to content of section all content in this section should be centered vertical and horizontal and also works in smaller devices, so padding is fine.p  pWell, I am wondering if you could help me with it because I really do not know how to code it or even rebuild it.p  pHere you can see a demo a hrefhttpcodepen.iotesteriuspenviryc relnofollowhttpcodepen.iotesteriuspenvirycap  pThats all. Hope you answer soon.p

Negative 1661 pI have created an application that will be doing .net to .net communications. From what I understand using TCP is the optimized way of doing this.p  pI created a proxy by using the Add Service. reference in Dev studio, and opened it as follows..p  precode NetTcpBinding tcp  new NetTcpBinding  string endPoint  string.Formatnet.tcp012, mconfiguration.IpAddress,           mconfiguration.Port, ServicesEndpointId  mproxy  new ProxyClienttcp, new EndpointAddressendPoint          codepre  pAt the moment, I am creating a single instance of this proxy, and just reusing for each call to it. I have an exception handler, and handle a EndpointNotFoundException for when the other server end may not be up and running which is likelyp  pThis all worked fine when I was initially using http not tcp, but now, if the server is down, or even after some idle time, I seem to be getting the following exception...p  precodeSystem.ServiceModel.CommunicationObjectFaultedException codepre  pI found some other posts that mention using a channel factory etc etc, and also a post that mentions to usep  precodeproxyInstance.InnerChannel.Faulted  new EventHandlerProxyFaulted codepre  pHowever I dont have a InnerChannel on my proxy, and the other channel stuff seemed a lot low level more like remoting use to be  I like the total abstraction away from all this using WCFp  pSo, my question is, should I just be creating a new instance of the proxy for each call Will the old proxy clean itself up there does not seem to be any close etc on itp  pThanks in advance for any suggestions herep
Negative 1661 pYou were hired by a director of a small company with N employees to set up the network between the employees who have to send a weekly report to each of the other employees as a different part or their report is important for each employee, depending on the importance of their work they have to send a report Ki number of times per weekp  pYou have measured the time it takes for a message to be delivered between each 2 employees Due to budget cuts the network will only have N1 connections between they employees and because of the simplicity of the technology you are using when one message is sent the entire network has to wait for it to be delivered only 1 message at a timep  pWhat you get is N the number of employees, you get Ki which is the muber of times a report from worker i is to be sent per week, Tij which indicates the time a message traveles from employee i to employee j 1ltNlt13 p  p0ltKilt103p  p0ltTijlt103p  pTij  Tji, Tii  0p  pAt first I assumed the most optimal network would be a star tree and all it would take is to determine which node to be in the center and since we were limited to an N at most 13 I decided to just brute force it and try them all, but that attempt failed as apparently this was not the most optimal network configuration or so the test cases showed me Then I thought maybe this would be solved by finding a minimum spanning tree or each full graph made from the employees, but since there are multiple minimum spanning trees and not all of them are equaly good for this problem that failed on paper alreadyp  pI am currently a bit out of ideas, so a hint as to what direction I should be looking towards would be greatp

Negative 1661 pRight, so Im trying to create a Contacts application using Python OOP. Im fairly new to OOP and still trying to get my head around the concepts.p  pI understand that a Class is a blueprint for all objects. I like to think of a Class as an entity and each Object is a record of that entity. I am from a Database background so thats why I interpret it like this, feel free to correct me.p  pAnyways, in the Contacts app Im making Ive created the Class codeContactscode as outlined belowp  precode class Contacts     def initself, firstName, lastName, address, groupType,                  telephone, mobile, email, photoField         self.firstName  firstName         self.lastName  lastName         self.address  address         self.groupType  groupType         self.telephone  telephone         self.mobile  mobile         self.email  email         self.photoField  photoField      def showDetailsself         printFirst Namet, self.firstName         printLast Namet, self.lastName         printAddresst, self.address         printTelephonet, self.telephone         printMobilet, self.mobile         printEmailt, self.email codepre  pNow, if I want to emaddem contacts through the Contacts class into the list Im using to store each contact object, do I have to create an codeAddContactscode class, or do I create a function instead I dont know if Im putting my question across well enough for you to understand what I meanp  pWhat I guess Im trying to say is that adding contacts is a process and if you look at it from a database point of view you wouldnt create a table called tblAddContacts since you would do that via a query or a stored procedure, so in my view I would define adding contacts being a function. But asking my colleague who does C programming he says that adding contacts should be defined by a Class.p  pThis is a confusing concept for me, especially since I dont understand how I would link the codeAddContactscode class with the codeContactscode class, or even how to define an codeAddContactscode class in the first place.p  pHere is the function I defined for adding contactsp  precodedef addContacts     firstName  inputFirst Name      lastName  inputLast Name      address  inputAddress      telephone  inputTelephone      mobile  inputMobile      email  inputEmail      printn      contact  ContactsfirstName, lastName, address, None, telephone, mobile, email, None      contactsList.appendcontact      pickle.dumpcontactsList, opensave.p, wb codepre  pPlease help me out, since I will turning this into a GUI application uni assignment.p

Negative 1661 pHow do you identify model relationship verbs in Djangop  pSo, lets say I have a model codeMoviecode, and want fields for codeDirectorcode and codeWritercode.  I dont want to have two distinct tables for these roles, like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKcn4K.png altentity relationship diagram, incorrectp  p...because it violates database best practices normal forms, etc., and doesnt keep things DRY.  Instead I want a single codePersoncode model, via a codeManyToManycode relationship with codeMoviecode, like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKSO4i.png altentity relationship diagram, correctp  pHow do I allow these verbs, marked in the diamonds, to be specified at runtimep  pFor example, in the Django Admin, codeMoviecode should have a codePersoncode field, with some place to enter a codeRolecode, e.g. codewritten bycode or codedirected bycode.  I dont want to have fields in codeMoviecode for each possible role I dont want a codedirectorcode or codewritercode or codeanimaltrainercode field, for example.  There might be hundreds... some of them duplicates.p  pIn Rails, Id just make a join table with an extra field codeRolecode, but I assume Django has a better way.p  pIm sure this is documented somewhere in the Django docs, or maybe just in general SQL docs somewhere, but I guess I dont know the correct search terms to Google.  A link to relevant docs would be sufficient, if they exist.  Thanksp

Negative 1661 pWhen I call a Google Places autocomplete API call over https from PHP using cURL, I find that it is much slower than fetching the same URL from a web browser in PHP such a call typically takes around 200ms, while fetching the same URL in a web browser, according to Firebug, takes no more than 45ms. Thats a slowdown by a factor 4 to 5. More accurately the first call in the web browser can take up to 250ms, but subsequent fetches in the web browser, even when using different parameters, are fast.p  pNote that both are tested from the same computer, so I dont think you can blame it on my network speed.p  pNow when adding the roundtrip from the mobile app to my server, such a delay is very noticeable, almost unacceptable.p  pSo my question is what is the cause of this extra slowdown, and is there a way to remedy itp  pMy first guess is that the SSL handshake and verification of Google APIs certificate may be part of the problem, and which may be why the first fetch in the browser is equally slow. But whatever I try, I cant find a way to make it faster in PHP.

Negative 1661 pI know creating JAR files is easy, just use eclipse, right click on the project and select export and follow the wizard. p  pThere is also another way that is commandline, we can use this command. p  precodejar cf myjarfilename.jar file1.class file2.class codepre  pThe problem is I cannot use use eclipse to create JAR because my code is compiled in separate projects and then I place .class files in a particular hierarchy, compiled em into a JAR and place em at a specific location from where my webapp uses it.p  pI could use the command line but that is not practical as my hierarchy is complex and uses a lot of .class files. folders and only .class filesp  pNow I need to make a JAR out of it. How to.p

Negative 1661 pI use an engine in my rails app that logins the user and redirects to a service param its a CAS engine. However, from the host app I want to redirect the user after heshe has logged in in a different location sometimes depending on the params. At the moment I cant get it work because rails permits only 1 call of redirecttorender. The engine inherits from my rails app ApplicationController.p  pHow can I overrideredefine redirectto to call it multiple timesp  pThe problem might be solved in other ways but I really dont want them. I have tried some of them but none can compete with the simplicity of just letting the last defined redirectto take action.p  pIm emonlyem interested in solutions that involve redefining coderedirecttocode so that I can invoke it multiple times.p
Negative 1661 pIm using Node.js v0.10.29 with Socket.io v0.9.17. I cant upgrade Socket.io to v1.0.6 because I need to communicate with Android devices, and at the moment it seems that no one of the solutions to do it have been updated to work with Socket.io v1.0.p  pThe problem I have is that, when using Socket.io v0.9.17, the bandwidth used is very high. As an example, for the same amount of data, Socket.io v0.9.17 uses 800KB, when Socket.io v1.0.6 uses 8KB...p  pDoes any one knows why  And what can I do to avoid that p  pThanksp
Negative 1661 pI want to change the frame size of a codeUICollectionViewcode in an animation that runs alongside an animated cell insertion to the same collection view inside a codeperformBatchUpdatescompletioncode block.p  pThis is the code that triggers the cell insertionp  precode[collectionView performBatchUpdates     indexPathOfAddedCell  ...     [collectionView insertItemsAtIndexPaths[ indexPathOfAddedCell ]]  completionnil] codepre  pBecause the cell insertion causes the collection views codecontentSizecode to change, I tried KVOregistering for changes to that property and then trigger the collection view frame update from the KVO handler.p  pThe problem with that approach is that the KVO trigger for codecontentSizecode fires too late the cell insertion animation has already completed at that time actually, KVO triggers right before the completion handler of codeperformBatchUpdatescompletioncode gets called but after the animation has played out in the UI.p  pIm not using auto layout.p  pemEditem I put a hrefhttpsgithub.comoleCollectionViewContentSizeAnimationa sample project to demonstrate my problema on GitHub.p  pemEdit 2em I should mention that I need this for a component Im writing a hrefhttpsgithub.comoleOLEContainerScrollViewcodeOLEContainerScrollViewcodea that is supposed to be 100 independent of the collection view. Because of this, I cannot subclass the collection view layout, nor do I have influence over the code that triggers the cell animations. Ideally, a solution would also work for codeUITableViewcode, which exhibits the same behavior.p

Negative 1661 pIm doing a little MMO project and right now Im working on the loginregister system. Whenever I try to send a ClientLoginPacket, the client disconnects from the server and the packet is not received at all by the server. There is no stack trace that shows up but here is my code. Sorry its a lot but its all necessaryp  pClientLoginPacket.javap  precodepackage net.vediogames.archipelo.networking.packets  import net.vediogames.archipelo.networking.Networking  public class ClientLoginPacket extends Packet      private String username     private String password     private int validity  0      public ClientLoginPacketString username, String password         this.username  username         this.password  password           public String getUsername         return this.username           public String getPassword         return this.password           public int getLoginValidity         return validity           public void setLoginValidityint validity         this.validity  validity           public void send         Networking.sendTCPthis       codepre  pThats the login packet. The only difference with this one and the server one is the import and package declaration its archipeloserver instead of just archipelo. As you can see, this class extends Packet, here is my Packet classp  precodepackage net.vediogames.archipelo.networking.packets  public abstract class Packet       protected int connectionID      public abstract void send      public int getConnectionId         return connectionID          public void setConnectionIDint id         this.connectionID  id        codepre  pAll packets have a codesendcode method that is called to send them. The way I send my packets is by doing this codenew ClientLoginPacketusername, password.sendcode. I the ClientLoginPacket class you can see that is runs Networking.sentTCPthis to send the packet. This just runs this code in my main kryonet class codeNetworking.javacode. Here is the code it uses to send packets on the client sidep  precodepublic static void sendTCPPacket object     client.sendTCPobject  codepre  pIn kryonet, you have to register classes before sending them. I did that but I dont know if I did it properly. Here is the exact code I used. Serverp  precodeprivate static void setupClasses     Kryo kryo  server.getKryo     kryo.registerClientRegisterPacket.class     kryo.registerClientLoginPacket.class     System.out.printlnRegistered classes.  codepre  pClientp  precodepublic static void setupClasses     Kryo kryo  client.getKryo     kryo.registerClientRegisterPacket.class     kryo.registerClientLoginPacket.class  codepre  pWhat I know for sure is that I do have a connection to the server before sending a packet, I tested it with the connection listener on the server. What would my issue be Is there something wrong with my class registration Do both classes have to be completely identical Thanks in advancep  pp.s. sorry for throwing all that code out. I wouldnt normally do this if I didnt have to. I put the least as possible. If you need more to see how the other stuff works and to see if the issue is there, just ask me. Thanksp

But theres a lot of oneoff elements that just need a little specific adjustment here and there, e.g. a small margin to make it look just right, and creating a new class or id for each one of them seems extraordinarily cumbersome. I end up with lots of oneoff classes and ids that are not easy to navigate, and instead of finding the style information where its used in the relevant tag, I have to go search in some random .css file.p  pYet, the internet tells me it is always preferred to keep all my style information in .css files. Whos correct Have I stumbled upon a specific case where inline styling is better, or would I somehow be shooting myself in the foot by doing that Is there perhaps even a third way that is betterp

Negative 1661 pFor my Windows Phone 8 App I have a Listbox element like below when I press multiselect icon on AppBar, I want to show checkboxes inside DataTemplate.

Negative 1661 pId like to be able to purge the database of all data between Integration test executions. My first thought was to use an codeorg.springframework.test.context.support.AbstractTestExecutionListenercode registered using the codeTestExecutionListenerscode annotation to perform the necessary cleanup between tests.p  pIn the codeafterTestMethodTestContext testContextcode method I tried getting the database from the test context and using the codecom.mongodb.DB.dropcode method. This worked ok, apart from the fact that it also destroys the indexes that were automatically created by Spring Data when it first bound my managed codeDocumentcode objects.p  pFor now I have fixed this by resorting to iterating through the collection names and calling remove as followsp  precodefor String collectionName  database.getCollectionNames          if collectionIsNotASystemCollectioncollectionName             database.getCollectioncollectionName.removenew BasicDBObject       codepre  pThis works and achieves the desired result  but itd be nice if there was a way I could simply drop the database and just ask Spring Data to rebind and perform the same initialisation that it did when it started up to create all of the necessary indexes. That feels a bit cleaner and safer...p  pI tried playing around with the codeorg.springframework.data.mongodb.core.mapping.MongoMappingContextcode but havent yet managed to work out if there is a way to do what I want.p  pCan anyone offer any guidancep

So I switched the code top  precodeSDLEvent event  SDLPollEventampevent   if event.type  771       switch event.key.keysym.sym          case SDLKa mx  30             break     case SDLKd mx  30             break     case SDLKw my  30             break     case SDLKs my  30             break     default my  1       codepre  pThis causes the default case to run when I hold or press any key, so my object moves according to my  1. If I remove the default case and try pressing w,a,s, or d, nothing happens. If i keep my  1, but use SDLKEYDOWN instead of 771, nothing happens. I got the 771 code by printing the event.type whenever a key is being pressed. p

Negative 1661 pIn the answers to a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq2668353279202previous questiona, I learned how to effectively create what I would describe as a emcached singleton objectem There is only one present at any one time, but if its not needed, its deallocated.p  pIn order to test it, I wrote this unit testp  precode voidtestThingInstance      MyThing thing1  [MyThing new]     MyThing thing2  [MyThing new]     XCTAssertEqualthing1, thing2, Should have single thing       Lets release the thing, but keep its address.     uintptrt pointerasinteger  uintptrtthing1     thing1  thing2  nil       Now get a new thing. It should be a brand new object.     thing1  [MyThing new]     XCTAssertNotEqual         uintptrtthing1, pointerasinteger,         Should have a new thing, not a permanent singleton       codepre  pThe trouble is, it fails that last assertion fails half the time. I put codeNSLogcode calls in various places in my code to make sure that a new object was, in fact, allocated after the other two references were released. The only thing I can guess is that the compiler is noticing that a memory space just the right size was recently freed and so decides to make use of it. Even when I stick in code to try to allocate something else in between, it still often uses the same memory address.p  pIs there any way I can get it not to do that Or, preferably, might there be a better way to make sure that a new object is allocated other than comparing memory addressesp

Negative 1661 pFirst off, I did do my research and completely understand that java explicitly says this should not be done. referencing this question here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19940319canyousplitastreamintotwostreamsCan you split a stream into two streamsap  pthat out of the way, im building an application where i would like to both save a file to a place using streams internet in, local filesystem out, and display that file usually an image to a JFrame. The system I am currently using simply chains them together, from the internet in to the file out. then from the file out to the local object, that is sent via a listener to the JFrame. This works but feels very inefficient. So in conclusion my question is, Is there a more efficient way of in essence forking a stream in such a wayp

Negative 1661 pIm currently developing an application as a page of a college project to display information about house price costs and am looking to implement a colourcoded map for different years. The idea would be that there would be a dot where each house sold was located on a map Google Maps for example, and colourcoded green to red depending on how expensive it was.p  pIm looking for a way to implement this using the Google Maps API, but have been unable to find a solution that doesnt seriously slow up the application as I would be loading in 30k datapoints for each year and the application currently had 5 years worth of data.p  pWould anyone have any suggestions on what to use. Ive looked at Googles Geocharts and they dont really offer what I am looking for. Ive also looked at Heatmaps, and though they get the colouring effect Im looking for, the points are weighted so the colour is dependent on proximity rather than my specified variable, price.p

Negative 1661 pI currently have a webapp HTML and JavaScript running on Apache which connects to our own Java Server application. The user enters their username and password in the browser and is then authenticated by the Java Server. Since the server supports LDAP the username and password can be the users standard Windows login credentials.p  pWhat I would like to do is achieve SSO. The browser should automatically send the users current credentials to the Java Server when entering the site in such a way that the Java Server can authenticate the user. But I can find no simple approach to take.p  pI can see that all major browsers fully support the passing of credentials within an intranet, and our Java Server already supports authentication of a user against LDAP. The problem is the bit in the middle, getting the users credentials to the Java Server. Is there a standard way of achieving thisp

Negative 1661 pI have recently started with web services. In my project, I have to create a client side using wsdl provided. I have implemented the client part using JAXWS RI which is available as part of Java 6.  Now when I was going through some blogs, they mentioned that we should not use JAXWS of java, as it is just an reference implementation and  we have to go for libraries like Apache CXF or Axis2.p  pCould you please advice if we can use JAXWS RI of java in production  At the moment with JAXWS RI of Java, our client application testing is going on without any issues. Will it create any problem if we use it under high load p  pThanks,p  pVijayp

Negative 1661 pI am wondering whether it is possible to speed up pandas codedataframe.groupbycode with the following applicationp  pBasic data structurep  ul liHDFStore with 9 columnsli li4 columns are columns with data codecolFcode ... codecolIcodeli lithe combination of the remaining 5 columns codecolAcode ... codecolEcode gives a unique indexli licodecolEcode is a last modified columnli ul  pThe basic idea is to implement a data base with a transactional memory. Assuming an entry changes, I dont delete it but write a new row with a new value in the last modified column. This allows me to retroactively look at how entries have changed over time.p  pHowever, in situations where I only want the currently valid state of the data, it requires selecting only those rows with the most recent last modified columnp  precodeidx  df.groupby[colA, colB, colC, colD],                   asindexFalse, sortFalse[colE].max dfcurrentstate  df.mergeidx, inner, on[colA, colB, colC, colD, colE] codepre  pThis codegroupbycode method eats up about 70 of my run time.p  pNote For the majority of rows, there exists only a single entry with respect to the last modified column. Only for very few, multiple versions of the row with different last modified values exist.p  pstrongIs there a way to speed up this process other than changing the program logic as followsstrongp  hr  h2Alternative Solution without need for codegroupbycodeh2  pAdd an additional boolean column codeactiveStatecode which stores whether the row is part of the active state.p  pWhen rows change, mark their codeactiveStatecode field as codeFalsecode and insert a new row with codeactiveStateTruecode.p  pOne can then query the table with codeactiveStateTruecode rather than use codegroupbycode.p  pMy issue with this solution is that it has the potential for mistakes where the codeactiveStatecode field is not set appropriately. Of course this is recoverable from using the last modified column, but if the codegroupbycode could be sped up, it would be foolproof...p

For the tweet I have informations like it is a reply to another tweet and the other users who have been mentioned in this tweet.p  pI want to add followers and tweets as nodes, then using the replyto and the mentionsuser field of the tweets to add connections between tweets replyto and tweet and user mentions. p  pAdding the nodes works well with batch.

Negative 1661 pI have an old doubt about constants in Java Projects maintenance.

In other hand if we put those constants inside the class for somehow people dont like it. They say what about we have the same constant declare somewhere the problem is maintainance issues, if we change those constants in that class the change can be visible on several parts without any big problem.p  pThose constants are mainly used for mapping webservices for java perspective without having to generating POJOs like JAXB based on WSDL, the webservices operations are mapped directly for key value maps in Java. I want to know what do you think about this approach and if we have any other choice.p  pThank you.p

Negative 1661 pIm working through the Rust documentation book and am confused about its use of semicolons to separate statements.  p  pIn one example it uses the codeprintlncode macro as a statement terminated by a semicolon p  precodeuse stdcmpOrdering  fn cmpa i32, b i32 gt Ordering      if a lt b  OrderingLess      else if a gt b  OrderingGreater      else  OrderingEqual    fn main      let x  5     let y  10      let ordering  cmpx, y      if ordering  OrderingLess          printlnless      else if ordering  OrderingGreater          printlngreater      else if ordering  OrderingEqual          printlnequal       codepre  pAnd when using the codematchcode expression to simplify it...p  precodeuse stdcmpOrdering  fn cmpa i32, b i32 gt Ordering      if a lt b  OrderingLess      else if a gt b  OrderingGreater      else  OrderingEqual    fn main      let x  5     let y  10      match cmpx, y          OrderingLess gt printlnless,         OrderingGreater gt printlngreater,         OrderingEqual gt printlnequal,       codepre  pThe semicolons are gone, indicating that codeprintlncode is not a statement, but an expression in this context.

Negative 1661 pI am considering two different layout arrangements for a view which will be a row in a RecyclerView. They are different, but they will both work, either asp  ol liOne container vertical LinearLayout containing rows of FrameLayouts e.g. LinearLayout  FrameLayouts  Contentli liOne big RelativeLayout that contains all other views no FrameLayouts but all TextViews, Buttons and such e.g. RelativeLayout  Contentli ol  pNow I was wondering which one would be more preferable in terms of Layout performancep  pIt was my understanding that a RelativeLayout has to be measured twice and thus is pretty slow, while a FrameLayout is fast and a LinearLayout is ok in terms of layout performance. In one case I would only have one container that is slow RelativeLayout  Content in the other I would have two containers that are quicker LinearLayout  FrameLayouts  Content. p

However, a friend of mine somewhat commented about thisp  blockquote   pYou are storing objects by their id memory address which is most likely going to leaks or get values of garbage collected objects from a new one which reused the pointer. This is dangerous since the id itself is not a reference but only an integer independent of the object itself which means you will most likely store freed pointers and grow in size till you hit a MemoryError.p blockquote  pAnd Ive been experiencing some random crashes, could this be the reason of the crashes If so, is there a better way to cache the values other than their codeidcodep  pstrongEditstrong Just to make sure my codePlayercode class inherits from codegameengine.Playercode, which is not created by me Im only creating a mod for an other game, and the codegameengine.Playercode is used by always getting a new instance of the player from his codeid0code. So this isnt a behavior defined by me.p

In my database, I have manually collected all the restaurant information such as name, photos, reviews, opening time etc. Please note that this collection has been done manually and not with the Google API.p  pNow, since Google allows to cache id of places, I have manually mapped their id to my restaurants.So, my database has five fields. id, name, photos, reviews and opening time. Again to reiterate, only the ids are from google, all other data has been manually collected by me.p  pThe reason for doing this is that I want to serve a mix of both info for nearby restaurants.

Googles terms of usage are not very clear, so it would be great if someone can clarify this.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1661 pComing back to Haskell four years after the first glimpse of it. Im always as amazed by the expressiveness, and as baffled by my inability to predict spacetime performance.p  pAs a warm up, I took to translating a tiny toy program I had written in C. Its about cheating at Scrabble. You input your game, and it outputs possible words you may play, with your letters alone or by crossing a letter on the board.p  pThe whole thing revolves around a dictionary thats preloaded at start up. The words are then stored as lists in a map, together with their anagrams. The keys are strings of sorted letters. An example will speak more clearly  p  precodeKey  AEHPS  Value  [HEAPS,PHASE,SHAPE] codepre  pThe C version reads the 320000 words of the dictionary one at a time, in about 200ms in total. The resulting data structure is a hashmap stored in a codearraylt99991, vectorltstringgtgtcode and takes up about 12 megabytes of memory.p  pThe Haskell version reads the same dictionary in about 5 seconds, and the program heap size was ballooning up to 400 megabytes  I changed the value type in the codeData.Mapcode from code[String]code to code[ByteString]code to save some memory, and that brought the program memory consumption down to roughly 290 megabytes. Thats still 24 times more than my C version. Thats more than mere overhead, even though codeData.Mapcode is a tree instead of an array.p  pSo I assume that Im doing something wrong.p  pThe whole module is visible here  deprecated linkp  pI suppose that my trouble has something to do with the way that codeData.Mapcode gets built incrementally, growing upon previous versions of itself  Or with the data structure itself  Or something else p  pIll try other solutions, like codeData.HashMapcode, or filling up codeData.Mapcode with codefromListWithcode. Nevertheless, Id like to build up some understanding of whats going on here. Thanks a lot for any insight p  hr  pShort answer p  pUsing Data.Map.Strict, forcing the evaluation of value elements, and storing the keys as ByteStrings too made the miracle of dividing the memory footprint nearly by 3. The result is 100Meg, which is only twice larger than a standard codestdmultimapltstdstring, stdstringgtcode in C for the same dataset. No speedup though. Git updated.p  pThanks a lot to all who contributed, there is interesting material down here p
Negative 1661 pSetup iTerm2 in Mac OS X with a python 2.7 application using curses. Leaving it alone works fine it uses a timer to update information and rewrite the screen and two pads. If I accidentally scroll up with the mousewheel or mousepad, I see the individual frames written by iterations in the programs whileloop. Also, this causes some kind of memory or CPU lag such that it takes a VERY long time to get back to the bottom and view the actual application again.p  pIf at all possible, Id like to avoid this.

Right now, we have Google documents with tables that show screen drafts and their corresponding english texts and their translations.

I used 25 6.5k instances of the data to train the model and classified the remaining 75 19.5k instances.p  pI know the true class of every single object training and test objects, so I made my model output a file of the form header shownp  precodeobjectid    predictedclass    actualclass object1     class1            class1 object2     class2            class1 .            .                  . .            .                  . .            .                  . object19.5k   class20           class20 codepre  pSo my question is Is is correct to calculate sensitivity TPTPFN and specificity TNTNTP of the model for this multiclass system I am getting sensitivity values that seem right in the range of 50  95, but my specificity values are all really high 97. This seems to be due to the large amount of ojbects and classes I have.

Does that seem reasonable Thanksp  pEDIT Can I calculate false discovery rate alsop

Negative 1661 pI am practicing a clientserver application in C. In the application, the client first registers with the server and gets the codeclientidcode in return. Next time onwards, the client sends the messages to the server prepending the codeclientidcode to the message. Below code snippet is from the server, where after receiving the message, the server retrieves the codeclientidcode from the message, which is a 3 char long string with start address as 1 and end address as 4 from the message array. eg. In the message code1001CLIENT001MESSAGE01code, 1 at location 0 is for some purpose, 001 is the codeclientidcode and codeCLIENT001MESSAGE01code is the message from the client.p  precodechar createdynamicstringint strsize          char dynstring  mallocstrsizesizeofchar         ifdynstring                          printfDynamic string could not be created                 return NULL                  dynstring[0]  0         return dynstring   void freedynamicstringchar dynstring          freedynstring   char message is dynamically allocated char array. char retrieveclientidchar message          char clientid         int i         clientid  createdynamicstringCLIENTIDSIZE  1          ifclientid                          printfClientid is NULL                 return NULL                  fori  1 i lt CLIENTIDSIZE  1 i               clientid[i1]  message[i]          strncpyclientid, message  1, CLIENTIDSIZE          memcpyclientid, message  1, CLIENTIDSIZE          clientid[CLIENTIDSIZE]  0         printfclientid retrieveds, clientid         return clientid  codepre  pThe server accepts a connection from the clients and processes the messages in different threads.

Negative 1661 pI have an WinForms application that keeps track when system enters suspended state sleep and when it resumes. App uses the codeSystemEventscode class for this purpose. It works fine on my machine. However it seems that for some users the event with codePowerModes.Resumecode is not always raised. App recieves multiple codePowerModes.Suspendcode without any codePowerModes.Resumecode in between which is strange.p  pMy primary question is how that could possibly happen and how to avoid it and make resume detection reliablep  pThe code is pretty straightforward and is basically following very shortenedp  precodeImports Microsoft.Win32   Friend Class TehClass     Implements IDisposable       Private Sub New         AddHandler SystemEvents.PowerModeChanged, AddressOf Me.SystemPowerModeChanged     End Sub       Private Sub SystemPowerModeChangedsender As Object, args As PowerModeChangedEventArgs         Log.InfoPower mode changed 0., args.Mode     End Sub  Region IDisposable Support      just dropping handler there End Region  End Class codepre  pThere is an existing form within app all the time. However it could be minimized or hidden in the notification area. Also there is kept reference to the actual instance of the codeTehClasscode.p  pThis is the sample logp  precode[20150915 223838,501] Power mode changed Suspend.

Another thing is that suspend got invoked in roughly 20 minutes intervals. Could it be some kind of computer just partially wakesup without actually turning monitor on or so and lets apps to process whatever they need to network notifications, etc. and than is put into sleep again stuffp
