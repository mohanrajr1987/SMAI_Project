Positive 84213 pIm having a difficult time figuring out how to designing what feels like it should be a fairly straightforward layout for my collection view. The heights of each cell are equal. The widths vary. The interitem spacing should strongalwaysstrong be equal. The distance between rows should also always be equal. As more items are added, the width of the collection view will increase intelligently. Let me give an example. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com7qOzM.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7qOzM.png altDesired layoutap  pWhen I insert a new item, I will calculate the movement of items from rows maybe the first item of row 1 moves up to row 0, maybe the first item of row 2 moves up to row 1.

Positive 84213 pSo I have a UICollectionView that I want to use to display multiple UICollectionViewCells and different headers depending on the state the user is in. The problem is I cant seem to register multiple UICollectionResuableView header views within the storyboard. If I try to register one as a footer and use it as a header the app crashes. I also do not see anywhere in the storyboard to declare the number of sections, which would alleviate the problem. For now Im having to use multiple UICollectionViews and hideunhide the collectionview I want to display based on the header I need. Is there a better way to do this, or a way to register multiple header views in the same UICollectionView within the storyboardp

To show these Images I an using AFNetworking class method  strongsetImageWithURLURLstrong. p  pImage size is about 968, 968 this is taking hell lot of memory. If I convert these Images to NSData and compressed it by UIImageJPEGRepresentation method it is taking a lot of time to convert Image into NSData.

Positive 84213 pSo I have this issue where I have to load one entity on two collection views, and one table view. The thing is, primarily I just had to load one entity on the VC where the tableview is located. And that data entity has these parameters for i.e.p  ul liEngine type diesel or petrolli liCar colorli liMax.velocityli liYear of productionli ul  pNow, the main point was, to color the cells on the tableview depending on the type of the car engine. So, if the data Entity Car has a Bool value of isEngineDiesel  true, then the cell would be orange, if false, then it would be light blue. And this worked just fine, a simple if statement on the table view delegate method for loading such cells. But, now I had to implement another VC which has two collection views, in which, the first one loads ONLY Diesel engine Car entitys, and the other Petrol  type.  So I guess the issue is already clear here. How can I accomplish this Because after countless hours of experimenting the only idea I had was two make TWO entitys in which the one is DieselCar and the other PetrolCar. But that means changing the complete data structure, and also, instead of one table view I would actually need two, which doesnt seem like a good idea due the fact that it would overflow with all the data there is.p  pSo...any ideas gentsp  pEDITp  pSo far Ive only managed to get the cell titles, but the return value of number of cells is still a mystery on how to solve.

Positive 84213 pSo this is kind of a noobish question but I just cant figure out a very simple way to detect currently focused items codeindexPathcode.br I looked around hoping to see something very easy like codecollectionView.indexPathOfCurrentlyFocusedItemcode but didnt find anything remotely close. So I digged around and tried to find something similar at codeUIFocusEnvironmentcode, codeUIFocusUpdateContextcode trying to find the desired property but failed. So, the only solution I can come up with is just iterating through all visible cells and finding a cell with focused property set to true.p  pSo is there a more simple and elegant way to find the currently focused items codeindexPathcode Except tracking it through delegate method and saving it in view controllers propertyp

Positive 84213 pSo I have an application that builds the UI from a storyboard, and I have this ViewController that needs to render both a UITableView and UICollectionView within the same scene. p  pSo I basically created a regular UIViewController that that contains both a UITableView and a UICollectionView. The views are obviously set within the storyboard. The scene ViewController then contain a both UICollectionViewController and a UITableViewController.p  pI went this way cause this specific collectionView is a reuse from a very similar collection view from another place in the app. It works perfectly fine there, however, here nothing happens and the view doesnt appear there on run time. The tableView works just fine, and from what Ive found so should the UICollectionView, but obviously Im missing something. Is there something extra that a regular UIViewController needs to have a method or a property so that it will display the UICollectionView Obviously Im missing something since everything Ive found about this indicates that it is possible to do it this way.

Positive 84213 pWith the recent release of iOS 9, there may need to be some updates to existing code to compensate for any changes made to apples API. Recently it seems they have made it so that collection views now automatically adjust its content inset when a keyboard appears. This is useful for people who arent handling it manually and or supporting multiple OS versions. In my application its caused a bit of a headache. I finally came up with a solution using KVO to inform me when the system changes the insets and i react accordingly, it all works fine, with the exception of a single edge case.p  pIf i show the keyboard and then attempt to go back in the navigation stack via an interactive swipe causing codebeginAppearanceTransitionanimatedcode to be called, but then cancel it and then tap out side the keyboard to resign the first responder, the system all of a sudden decides it does not want to automatically update my insets and my KVO never gets triggered for the content inset, the keyboard goes away but the content inset is not reduced causing it too look wrong...if however i tap on the textfield causing the keyboard to show again, all of a sudden it decides to do its automatic updating again.p  pDoes anyone have anyone have any idea as to why it ignores my first dismissal of the keyboard after cancelling a interactive transition for updating my insetsp

Negative 84213 pI have a Gridview control on an ASP.Net page with fixed width cells. The data coming from the database occasionally comes over as a contiguous string of characters. When there are dashes in the string, it will break so as not to upset the width of the layout.

Is there a way to tell the cell to keep its width and break the string As it stands, I dont have access to the fields data directly, as the GridView bind its datasource to a dataset object coming from the database.

These groups are made by any one person being a match with any other person in the group. So any person from one group will NOT be a match with any person from another group.

Negative 84213 pIm following a tutorial on how to use Interface Builder from Chapter 2 of Zdziarskys iPhone SDK Application Development. The idea appears to be to create a very basic app which consists of a Tab Bar Controller which has two buttons, each tied to a different view object and each view object in its own respective .xib file. What I end up with is a blank window and some code thats significantly different from what the book indicates I should have.p  pI suspect a missing step, but the instructed steps are scattered across a chapter of explication, so Im not 100 sure Ive havent missed something. Heres a summary of what the steps appear to bep  ol liCreate a new windowbased application named Example.li liOpen MainWindow.xib in Interface Builder and do the following a Select the Window icon in the document window, open the inspector, set various extraneous properties. b Drag a Tab Bar Controller into the document window.  c Edit the two tab names to Recents and History. d Save MainWindow.xibli liCreate a new Cocoa Touch View IB template. Add a Table View to it. Save it as Recents.xib. li liSimilarly, create another Cocoa Touch View IB template. Add a text view to it, save as History.xib.li liGo back to MainWindow.xib, edit each of the tabs in the Tab Bar Controller in the Inspector so that the Nib Name corresponds to the appropriate .xib file created in step 3 for Recents and step 4 for History.li liAdd Recents.xib and History.xib to the project Example.li ol  pAt this point, the book says that if I look at ExampleAppDelegate.h, I should see links to the Interface Builder objects in my code, such asp  precodeproperty nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UIWindow window property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet RootViewController viewController codepre  pWhen I actually look at the file, though, I only see the first UIWindow line above. The RootViewController line is absent. p  pSimilarly, the book says that when I look inside of ExampleAppDelegate.m, I should see some synthesize directivesp  precodesynthesize window synthesize viewController codepre  pBut again, I only see the line relevant to window. p  pAnd sure enough, if I click Build and Go, what I see in the simulator is an empty window. p  pOne of the things I noticed while going through this process was that I wasnt instructed to drag the Tab Bar Controller from step 2b directly into the displayed Window object in the interface builder. I tried to do this anyway and found that I wasnt allowed to and in fact, that view controllers of any kind didnt seem welcome directly in the Window. This seemed odd to me  I noticed that directly dragging a View object into the Window seemed OK. But since Views cant contain View Controllers, I cant see how youre ever supposed to add a View Controller inside of a heirarchy contained in a Window.p  pWhat steps andor pieces of knowledge am I missing herep

Here is an example of the code I am using to generate the comma separated listp  precodeCreate Table List [col] varchar  Insert Into List Select 1 Insert Into List Select 2 Insert Into List Select 3  Select ,  [col] From List For Xml Path codepre  pThis gives the results 1,2,3 as expected, but there is no way to get the count that there are 3 items.  Any attempt to add a count will just add it to the xml.  I combined this code with a cte to get the countp  precodeWith CTE As      Select          [col]      From          List  Select    Select ,  [col] From List For Xml Path As [List],    Count As [Count] From    CTE codepre  pIs there an easiercleaner way to get the count of nodes without using a CTE  It was pointed out that you can just duplicate the from clause inside the inner select and outside, but that requires keeping the from clauses in sync.  I want to get both the list and count, but only have the from clause written once.p
Negative 84213 pI have a rails app that shows statistics based on an employees daily production. currently my page shows ALL records. p  pI know how to show various different combinations such as records made between two dates etc... but what I really would like to do is make it so that single page say the index page has 3 controls that allow for it to switch between daily statistic records, weekly statistic records and a custom date constraint of statistic records such as from date xxxx2009 to date xxxx2010. I have been searching for a while to attempt to figure this out but I am obviously missing something as I cannot find anyone else who has run into the same issues.p  pIf this is too difficult to do this way, the other  mostly easy way I can see to do this is to create a page for each view, however it still leaves a question on how I set up the control to choose the custom date constraints.p  pI aplogise in advance for my newbyness but if someone could explain this to me, I think it is going to really increase my understanding of rails.

Negative 84213 pI am relatively new to the Silverlight experience and am trying to create a MVVM app with a DomainService that returns POCOs as the models. I have a UserControl that has a TreeView with the ItemsSource set to bind to an ObservableCollection of a type that has an ObservableCollection as one of its properties, and that collection is of a type that has a property of ObservableCollection. So Im using the HierarchicalDataTemplate as the ItemTemplate of the TreeView with TextBlocks to render the Name property of each item. I will include some code below.p  pSo the classes would be something like thisp  precodepublic class A      public int ID  get set      public string Name  get set      public ObservableCollectionltBgt Bs  get set    public class B      public int ID  get set      public string Name  get set      public ObservableCollectionltCgt Cs  get set    public class C      public int ID  get set      public string Name  get set   codepre  pBasically, my collections are getting populated from a DataRepository with a method that gets lists of A,B, and C. Adds each instance appropriately with LINQ through foreach loops. And returns a List. The method works correctly as I have called it from the default.aspx.cs and stepped through to confirm that all data is correctly added. p  pBut my problem is that when it is rendered on the screen, none of the collections are correct. For instance, the first item of As child collection of B should have a count of over 4000 and yet none are shown. And yet, the first item of B that is supposed to be in the collection Bs of the first A is shown for the second item of A.p  pexample of what it should bep  ul lipa1p  ul lib1.1 ul lic1.1.1li lic1.1.2li lic1.1.3li ulli lib1.2 ul lic1.2.1li lic1.2.2li ulli ulli lipa2p  ul lib2.4 ul lic2.4.1li lic2.4.2li lic2.4.3li ulli ulli lipa3p  ul lib3.6 ul lic3.6.1li lic3.6.2li lic3.6.3li ulli ulli lipa4p  ul lib4.8 ul lic4.8.1li lic4.8.2li lic4.8.3li ulli ulli ul  pexample of what it is showingp  ul lia1li lia2 ul lib2.2 ul lic2.2.2li ulli ulli lia3li lia4 ul lib4.4 ul lic4.4.4li ulli ulli ul  pAfter some investigation, the only pattern that I see is that the hierarchy is based on the IDs being the same.p  pHere are the code samplesp  pthe DataContext is set by a UserControl Resource  p  precodeltsdkTreeView ItemsSourceBinding PathAs gt  ltsdkTreeView.ItemTemplategt     ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate ItemsSourceBinding PathBsgt    ltTextBlock TextBinding PathName gt    ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemTemplategt     ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate ItemsSourceBinding PathCsgt      ltTextBlock TextBinding PathName gt      ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemTemplategt       ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate ItemsSourceBindinggt        ltTextBlock TextBinding PathName gt       ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplategt      ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemTemplategt     ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplategt    ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemTemplategt   ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplategt  ltsdkTreeView.ItemTemplategt ltsdkTreeViewgt codepre  pstrongViewModelstrongp  precodepublic class myViewModel      private myDomainContext context  new myDomainContext      public ObservableCollectionltAgt As              get                      LoadOperationltAgt loadOp  context.Loadcontext.GetAsQuery             return new ObservableCollectionltAgtloadOp.Entities                codepre  pI apologize about the length of this question, I was hoping to not be so vague and to get some helpful advise.

Negative 84213 pI have Rails app Rails 3.0.1, Ruby 1.9.2 that uses MySQL as its development database. The database is set up to use the utf8unicodeci collation, as well as all the fields. I also have a legacy PHP app that this Rails app is set to replace when its completed. The PHP app uses MySQL as well, but all of the fields are using latin1sweedishci. I have written Rake tasks that use both the MySQL API and ActiveRecord to import data from the old database to the new one, which seems to go well until it encounters Unicode characters in the source database. When using the mysql gem, after running the rake task and trying to load a page with Unicode characters on it, I get the following errorp  pcodeincompatible character encodings ASCII8BIT and UTF8codep  pSwitching to the rubymysql gem and restarting the server, however, fixes the problem, and the Unicode characters are displayed properly. However, it only works in this combination, because when I import the data using the rubymysql gem, the page renders but all of the Unicode is messed up and replaced with garbagey characters.p  pWhat can I do to fix this, or at least be able to import my data and render it without having to change the source code Im running MySQL server 5.1.53 from MacPorts on OS X Snow Leopard. I have compiled both the mysql and rubymysql gems as 64bit, though I do boot OS X with archi386, so that may not have been necessary.p  pHere is an example of a rake taskp  precode  desc Imports posts from legacy app   task posts gt environment do     my  Mysql.connectlocalhost, importer, password removed, publicweb, nil, optlocalvarrunmysql5mysqld.sock     res  my.querySELECT  FROM updates     res.each do row       post  Post.new       post.title  Legacy.stripslashes row[1]       post.body  Legacy.resolvebbcode row[3], true       post.publishedat  Time.parserow[4]       post.author  User.wherelogin gt row[2].first       post.oldid  row[0]       post.oldslug  row[5]       post.state  published       post.save     end     puts Imported res.numrows posts   end codepre

Negative 84213 pIm currently employed at a small ASP.NETMSSQL shop. My team has noticed that a very large amount of our development and bugfixing time is spent on our ADO.NET Database Access code. Were looking for a software solution that eases the process of mapping the DataTableSQLDataReader results to proper business objects. Manually specifying column names and casting the results is becoming a nightmare especially when schema changes are involved.p  pSo far, Entity Framework and to a lesser extent, LINQtoSQL has been the only piece of software weve found that automates this process fairly well. We simply add our stored procedures to the model and let them return autogenerated Complex Types. The ability to update the model from the database is also a big plus.p  pBefore we start migrating any of our many projects to Entity Framework, I was wondering if there are any other options that we should look at.

Negative 84213 pI am learning about a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiProgressiveenhancementProgressive Enhancementa and I have a question about AJAXifying views. In my MVC 3 project I have a layout page, a viewstart page, and two plain views.p  pThe viewstart page is in the root of the Views folder and thus applies to all views. It specifies that all views should use codeLayout.cshtmlcode for their layout page. The layout page contains two navigation links, one for each view. The links use codeHtml.ActionLinkcode to render themselves to the page.p  pNow I have added jQuery and want to hijack these links and use Ajax to load their content on the page dynamically.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function           theLink.clickfunction               .ajax                 url this.attrhref,                 type GET,                 success function response                      mainContent.htmlresponse                                           return false               ltscriptgt codepre  pThere are two ways I can think of to do this, but I dont particularly like either onep  p1 I can take the entire Views contents and place them in a partial view, then have the main view call the partial view when it is rendered. That way, using codeRequest.IsAjaxRequestcode in the controller, I can return codeViewcode or return codePartialViewcode based on whether or not the request is an Ajax request. I cant return the regular view to the Ajax request because then it would use the layout page and Id get a second copy of the layout page injected. However, I dont like this because it forces me to create empty views with just a codeHtml.RenderPartialcode in them for the standard GET requests.p  precode    public ActionResult Index              if Request.IsAjaxRequest             return PartialViewpartialView         else             return View      codepre  pThen in Index.cshtml do thisp  precodeHtml.RenderPartialpartialView codepre  p2 I can remove the layout designation from viewstart and specify it manually when the request is NOT Ajaxp  precode    public ActionResult Index              if Request.IsAjaxRequest             return View  Return view with no master.         else             return ViewIndex, Layout  Return view with master.      codepre  pDoes anyone have a better suggestion Is there a way to return a view without its layout page It would be much easier to explicitly say dont include your layout if it is an ajax request, than it would be to explicitly include the layout if its not an ajax.p

Negative 84213 pThis questions concerns the use of the formula field in a static mapping block in Grails.p  pI am trying to implement a very simple domain class that uses a formula mapping derived properties, but I keep getting a codeNo property found for name [uptime]code, where uptime is a derived property in the Grails domain class. The code is as follows simplified p  precodeclass Derive    Integer up   Integer down    static mapping       uptime formula  UPDOWNUP      class DeriveTests extends GroovyTestCase       void testDerivedProp        new Deriveup10, down5.save       new Deriveup5, down5.save       assertEquals Derive.all.size,2        assertEquals 2,Derive.findAllByUptimeGreaterThan0.1.size fails here       assertEquals 2,Derive.findAllByUptimeGreaterThan10105.size       codepre  pRunning the test gives me an error at the second assertEquals codeorg.codehaus.groovy.grails.exceptions.InvalidPropertyException No property found for name [uptime] for class [class Derive]code. I cannot see what I am doing wrong here, having consulted both Grails In Action and the a hrefhttpwww.grails.orgdoclatestguide5.20Object20Relational20Mapping2028GORM29.html5.5.2.1120Derived20Properties relnofollowreference docsa several times.p  pAny clues as to what I am doing wrong The backing db is a HSQLDB running in memory with default settings created by grails createapp.p  pedit I am a bit unsure whether I should add a property field for the formula or not. If I do add a property field Double uptime, the assert still fails, but this time because uptime is 0. Viewing the object in a debugger show that uptime is null. Still, the sql output shows me something that looks right codehibernate.SQL select this.id as id60, this.version as version60, this.down as down60, this.up as up60, this.UP100this.DOWNthis.UP as formula00 from derive thiscodep
Negative 84213 pI have about 10 pieces of data from a record and I want to be able to define the layout of a string where this data is returned, with the option of leaving some pieces out.  My thought was to use an enum to give integer values to my tokensfields and then have a format like code0123code  or something as complicated as code4  31  [8]code.  The meaning of the tokens relates to fields in my database.  For instance I have this enum for my tokens relating to payments made.p  precodeAccountMask  0, AccountLast4  1, AccountFirstDigit  2, AccountFirstLetter  3, ItemNumber  4, Amount  5 codepre  pAccount mask is a string like VXXXXX1234 where the V is for a visa, and 1234 are the last 4 digits of the card.  Sometimes clients wants the V, sometimes they want the first digit Its easy to translate a card type into a first digit.p  pMy goal is to create something reusable to generate a string using tokens in a format string that will then use the data associated with the digit inside the token to do an in place replace of the data.p  pSo, for an example using the mask above and my enum if I wanted to define a format code9214[00000000000]codep  pif the item number is 678934p  pwhich would then translate to 9412340000678934 where the inner  part of token 4 becomes a definition for a codeString.Formatcode of that value.  Also, the data placed around the tokens is ignored and kept in place.p  pMy issue comes to the manipulation of the string and the best practice.  I have been told that regular expressions can be costly if you are going to create them on the fly.  As a CS major, I have a feeling the right however complex solution is to make a lexerparser for my tokens.  I have no experience writing a lexerparse in C so Im not sure of the best practices around it.  Im looking for guidance here on a system that is efficient and easy to tweak.p

Negative 84213 pI thought aboutp  p1 Implement everything for the bw images, then make wrappers for the methods that check if its a color image. If it is, split the channels, make the operations on each individually and then merge them.p  p2 Use functors to correctly update the values depending on what Im dealing with. Problem is that the compiler errors would be really complicated and Im not used to it, and I think I may end up needing quite a few of them. Not sure if this is a good idea tbh.p  pThere might be a correct design pattern here Im not seeing too. There could also be a way to do this thats channelcolor agnostic in OpenCV though I havent found it yet, and so far the book Im reading OpenCV 2 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook hasnt shown me such a possibility yet.p

Negative 84213 pI write C code that makes certain assumptions about the implementation, such asp  ul licodecharcode is 8 bits.li lisigned integral types are twos complement.li licodegtgtcode on signed integers signextends.li liinteger division rounds negative quotients towards zero.li licodedoublecode is IEEE754 doubles and can be typepunned to and from codeuint64tcode with the expected result.li licomparisons involving NaN always evaluate to false.li lia null pointer is all zero bits.li liall data pointers have the same representation, and can be converted to codesizetcode and back again without information loss.li lipointer arithmetic on codecharcode is the same as ordinary arithmetic on codesizetcode.li lifunctions pointers can be cast to codevoidcode and back again without information loss.li ul  pNow, all of these are things that the C standard doesnt guarantee, so strictly speaking my code is nonportable. However, they happen to be true on the architectures and ABIs Im currently targeting, and after careful consideration Ive decided that the risk they will fail to hold on some architecture that Ill need to target in the future is acceptably low compared to the pragmatic benefits I derive from making the assumptions emnowem.p  pThe question is how do I best document this decision Many of my assumptions are made by practically everyone nonoctet codecharcodes or signmagnitude integers on a future, commercially successful, architecture. Others are more arguable  the most risky probably being the one about function pointers. But if I just list emeverythingem I assume beyond what the standard gives me, the readers eyes are just going to glaze over, and he may not notice the ones that actually matter.p  pSo, is there some wellknown set of assumptions about being a somewhat orthodox architecture that I can incorporate by reference, and then only document explicitly where I go beyond even that Effectively such a profile would define a new language that is a superset of C, but it might not acknowledge that in so many words  and it may not be a pragmatically useful way to think of it either.p  pstrongClarificationstrong Im looking for a shorthand way to emdocumentem my choices, not for a way to test automatically whether a given compiler matches my expectations. The latter is obviously useful too, but does not solve everything. For example, if a business partner contacts us saying, were making a device based on Googles new G2015 chip will your software run on it  then it would be nice to be able to answer we havent worked with that arch yet, but it shouldnt be a problem if it has a C compiler that satisfies suchandsuch.p  pstrongClarify even morestrong since somebody has voted to close as not constructive Im not looking for discussion here, just for pointers to actual, existing, formal documents that can simplify my documentation by being incorporated by reference.p

More about Dialogs that have the main frame as parent and are opened and closed during the application life time.

Negative 84213 pI have inherited a SpringNHibernate c app that we are doing a major overhaul on and Im fairly new to NHibernate.

So, what am I doing incorrectly here  Thanks.p  pUPDATE  Im trying to make my question clearer.  My big problem is that all the examples Ive ever found show inserting BOTH of the related objects into each respective table and into the join table.  I want to be able to add a User with an EXISTING Role.  I dont ever want an insert to occur in the ROLES table when creating a User.  Creating a User should always insert ONE record into USERS and one or more records into USERSXREFROLES, but NEVER into ROLES because the user will always be assigned to existing roles.  I hope this is clearer.  I have yet to find an example that shows this and this must be a pretty common thing to do.p

Negative 84213 pconfiginitializersdevise.rbp  precode Use this hook to configure devise mailer, warden hooks and so forth. The first  four configuration values can also be set straight in your models. Devise.setup do config    gt Mailer Configuration    Configure the email address which will be shown in DeviseMailer,    note that it will be overwritten if you use your own mailer class with default from parameter.   config.mailersender  abcgmail.com     Configure the class responsible to send emails.    config.mailer  DeviseMailer     gt ORM configuration    Load and configure the ORM. Supports activerecord default and    mongoid bsonext recommended by default. Other ORMs may be    available as additional gems.   require deviseormactiverecord     gt Configuration for any authentication mechanism    Configure which keys are used when authenticating a user. The default is    just email. You can configure it to use [username, subdomain], so for    authenticating a user, both parameters are required. Remember that those    parameters are used only when authenticating and not when retrieving from    session. If you need permissions, you should implement that in a before filter.    You can also supply a hash where the value is a boolean determining whether    or not authentication should be aborted when the value is not present.    config.authenticationkeys  [ email ]     Configure parameters from the request object used for authentication. Each entry    given should be a request method and it will automatically be passed to the    findforauthentication method and considered in your model lookup. For instance,    if you set requestkeys to [subdomain], subdomain will be used on authentication.    The same considerations mentioned for authenticationkeys also apply to requestkeys.    config.requestkeys  []     Configure which authentication keys should be caseinsensitive.    These keys will be downcased upon creating or modifying a user and when used    to authenticate or find a user. Default is email.   config.caseinsensitivekeys  [ email ]     Configure which authentication keys should have whitespace stripped.    These keys will have whitespace before and after removed upon creating or    modifying a user and when used to authenticate or find a user. Default is email.   config.stripwhitespacekeys  [ email ]     Tell if authentication through request.params is enabled. True by default.    config.paramsauthenticatable  true     Tell if authentication through HTTP Basic Auth is enabled. False by default.    config.httpauthenticatable  false     If http headers should be returned for AJAX requests. True by default.    config.httpauthenticatableonxhr  true     The realm used in Http Basic Authentication. Application by default.    config.httpauthenticationrealm  Application     It will change confirmation, password recovery and other workflows    to behave the same regardless if the email provided was right or wrong.    Does not affect registerable.    config.paranoid  true     gt Configuration for databaseauthenticatable    For bcrypt, this is the cost for hashing the password and defaults to 10. If    using other encryptors, it sets how many times you want the password reencrypted.       Limiting the stretches to just one in testing will increase the performance of    your test suite dramatically. However, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not use    a value less than 10 in other environments.   config.stretches  Rails.env.test  1  10     Setup a pepper to generate the encrypted password.    config.pepper  b1179d3eccc2985aa7e9e438d8866464943f84449e53014c19852e795fdc4c17ca0b779e843ea8826589c213aff8c91c16c4a937685a183b622899e0dbf120a6     gt Configuration for confirmable    A period that the user is allowed to access the website even without    confirming his account. For instance, if set to 2.days, the user will be    able to access the website for two days without confirming his account,    access will be blocked just in the third day. Default is 0.days, meaning    the user cannot access the website without confirming his account.    config.confirmwithin  2.days     Defines which key will be used when confirming an account    config.confirmationkeys  [ email ]     gt Configuration for rememberable    The time the user will be remembered without asking for credentials again.    config.rememberfor  2.weeks     If true, a valid remember token can be reused between multiple browsers.    config.rememberacrossbrowsers  true     If true, extends the users remember period when remembered via cookie.    config.extendrememberperiod  false     If true, uses the password salt as remember token. This should be turned    to false if you are not using database authenticatable.   config.usesaltasremembertoken  true     Options to be passed to the created cookie. For instance, you can set    secure gt true in order to force SSL only cookies.    config.cookieoptions       gt Configuration for validatable    Range for password length. Default is 6..128.    config.passwordlength  6..128     Email regex used to validate email formats. It simply asserts that    an one and only one  exists in the given string. This is mainly    to give user feedback and not to assert the email validity.    config.emailregexp  A[][]z     gt Configuration for timeoutable    The time you want to timeout the user session without activity. After this    time the user will be asked for credentials again. Default is 30 minutes.    config.timeoutin  30.minutes     gt Configuration for lockable    Defines which strategy will be used to lock an account.    failedattempts  Locks an account after a number of failed attempts to sign in.    none             No lock strategy. You should handle locking by yourself.    config.lockstrategy  failedattempts     Defines which key will be used when locking and unlocking an account    config.unlockkeys  [ email ]     Defines which strategy will be used to unlock an account.    email  Sends an unlock link to the user email    time   Reenables login after a certain amount of time see unlockin below    both   Enables both strategies    none   No unlock strategy. You should handle unlocking by yourself.    config.unlockstrategy  both     Number of authentication tries before locking an account if lockstrategy    is failed attempts.    config.maximumattempts  20     Time interval to unlock the account if time is enabled as unlockstrategy.    config.unlockin  1.hour     gt Configuration for recoverable       Defines which key will be used when recovering the password for an account    config.resetpasswordkeys  [ email ]     Time interval you can reset your password with a reset password key.    Dont put a too small interval or your users wont have the time to    change their passwords.   config.resetpasswordwithin  2.hours     gt Configuration for encryptable    Allow you to use another encryption algorithm besides bcrypt default. You can use    sha1, sha512 or encryptors from others authentication tools as clearancesha1,    authlogicsha512 then you should set stretches above to 20 for default behavior    and restfulauthenticationsha1 then you should set stretches to 10, and copy    RESTAUTHSITEKEY to pepper    config.encryptor  sha512     gt Configuration for tokenauthenticatable    Defines name of the authentication token params key    config.tokenauthenticationkey  authtoken     If true, authentication through token does not store user in session and needs    to be supplied on each request. Useful if you are using the token as API token.    config.statelesstoken  false     gt Scopes configuration    Turn scoped views on. Before rendering sessionsnew, it will first check for    userssessionsnew. Its turned off by default because its slower if you    are using only default views.    config.scopedviews  false     Configure the default scope given to Warden. By default its the first    devise role declared in your routes usually user.    config.defaultscope  user     Configure signout behavior.    Signout action can be scoped i.e. userssignout affects only user scope.    The default is true, which means any logout action will sign out all active scopes.    config.signoutallscopes  true     gt Navigation configuration    Lists the formats that should be treated as navigational. Formats like    html, should redirect to the sign in page when the user does not have    access, but formats like xml or json, should return 401.       If you have any extra navigational formats, like iphone or mobile, you    should add them to the navigational formats lists.       The  and  formats below is required to match Internet    Explorer requests.    config.navigationalformats  [, , html]     The default HTTP method used to sign out a resource. Default is delete.   config.signoutvia  delete     gt OmniAuth    Add a new OmniAuth provider.

Negative 84213 pMy manager assigned me a project whereby I have been using jQuery Calendar plugin to display calendar data stored across various tables in our SQL database.p  pIts just a jQuery plugin that takes static json data and renders it on a calendar. I had to integrate it with .net and our SQL database in such a way that the calendar could render the data from the SQL database Microsoft SQL.p  pInitially we put this together in such a way that we fetched all the data from the SQL server and then used .Net to construct the json and then pass it onto the jQuery calendar plugin.p  pAlthough in principle this worked well, it was extremely slow and IIS was often timing out. Not to mention, every time any of us wanted to view the calendar we had to wait around 3mins since the number of entries is approaching 3000.p  pThe queries were quite complex, theyre using on the fly Dateadd and DateDiff functions and alsorts of manners of operations. Execution time on the SQL server alone was around 90 seconds for the query. In total query size was around 160kb.p  pWe then split the query into 3 parts for different departments, but the amount of time we have to wait for the calendar to draw is still over a minute.p  pHere is an example of just one of the queries but there are over 100 of these per departmentp  precodeCREATE TABLE AnnualLastMonImportantCustomDate      Title varchar550 COLLATE Latin1GeneralCIAS NULL,      AllocatedDate varchar550 COLLATE Latin1GeneralCIAS NULL,      EndDateTime varchar550 COLLATE Latin1GeneralCIAS NULL,      url varchar550 COLLATE Latin1GeneralCIAS NULL,      width varchar10 COLLATE Latin1GeneralCIAS NULL,      height varchar550 COLLATE Latin1GeneralCIAS NULL,      AllDay varchar550 COLLATE Latin1GeneralCIAS NULL,      description varchar550 COLLATE Latin1GeneralCIAS NULL,       color  varchar550 COLLATE Latin1GeneralCIAS NULL,      textColor  varchar550 COLLATE Latin1GeneralCIAS NULL   DECLARE dbcursor CURSOR FOR SELECT AlertDate FROM xsCRMAlerts  WHERE AlertTypeInternalImportantDate   cursor is the results row when table goes through fetch process  SET MyTableNamexsCRMAlerts  OPEN dbcursor  opens the table and stores id, which is the primary key in the table    FETCH NEXT FROM dbcursor INTO MyTableName   MyTableName in this case is the result row.

Negative 84213 pIve had this idea bouncing around in my head, and I decided Im going to do it and learn a little in the process.p  pOkay, if you dont mind, Im going to pitch my website project to you.br It is based on collaboration, so I thought MediaWiki would be the best place to start, but I dont know where to go from here. I also checked out SemanticMediaWiki and SemanticForms, but it doesnt seem to do what I want.  p  pMy project is a site revolving around Multiple Choice Adventures. There are already sites that do this, like a hrefhttpeditthis.infochooseyourownadventureMainPage relnofollowhttpeditthis.infochooseyourownadventureMainPagea but I aim to have it entirely user friendly.br On that site, users must employ wiki markup effectively and set up the links manually. Thats functional and effective, but I want it to be totally user friendly.br I want the links and content submission to be a fluid process with no worrying about wiki markup.  p  pHeres what I want  p  pA user creates a top level page. A new story. Possibly a category He titles it Knights and Princesses.br He is asked to fill in the story text. He writes, You are a handsome knight with a brand new sword. A dragon is swooping towards you.br He saves the page.br The page now contains the title, the story text, and a linkbutton saying Add a new story branch.  p  pA second user comes along. He reads this page, and clicks Add a new story branch.br He is prompted to fill in a form. Absolutely no technical markup or manual editing.br He fills in his chosen title Run Away.br He fills in his story text The dragon chases you as you flee, but you concentrate on running as fast as you can. You notice a rabbit hopping along side you.br He saves the page.  p  pTwo things happen.br 1 The previous page is automatically updated. Above the link Add a new story branch a new link appears, titled Run Away. This new button links to the new page.br 2 The new page is published with the title, the story text, and also a linkbutton saying Add a new story branch.br Anyone can come along, click that button, write a new page, and the links will be added seamlessly. No need for messing with editing the page and adding wiki markup or URLs.  p  pIn addition, I hope to have the ability to categorize stories by adult content,and have a method to police and filter that.br I hope to have the ability for the original authors of a new story to define what the permissions will be, i.e. Authorized users only, anyone can edit, only registered users.br I hope to have the ability for only original authors to lock certain pages from being edited.br I hope to have the ability for authors to make stories private for a select group of users.br I hope to enable users to edit story text without seeing nasty code and markup.  p  pAm I dreaming here, or is this possible with MediaWiki I am only experienced in Joomla and MediaWiki.br Do I need to learn a web framework Rails, Django, Pylons, etc Where do I start Are there solutions that are already geared toward my project  p  pThanks for the advice   p

I dont know if I was at this for too long and my brain is fried but Im getting confused about the boolean statement used as an argument in the function constructor. See line 8.p  pThis is the explanation given by the tutorial p  blockquote   pThe constructor function is used to initialize the object when we   want to load an ACL. It is called automatically when we call new   ACL. It is then passed a single, optional argument of the user to   load the ACL for. Inside the constructor, we check to see if a user ID   was passed in. If no ID was passed, we assume that we will load the   ACL for the currently logged in user so we read in the session   variable for that. Alternatively, if we pass in a user ID, it allows   us to read and edit the ACL for a user other than the one logged in   useful for your admin page.p blockquote  psQuestion 1... so this method is starting up as soon as you make a new class, and it is taking the boolean as an argument. Im not understanding why you need to state the fact that userID   . Couldnt you just make it simpler and write function constructoruserID  if userID   ........etc. etc.  Or do they mean the same thing  The idea of stating a boolean never made sense to me, especially when youre not using it in an IF statement to test its validity. sp  pEDIT I made a very weird slip. Sorry disregard the whole boolean thing, its not even a boolean statement. My error... 12 hours of learning programming is taking its toll.p  pQuestion 2 Is the variable userID in line 5 the same as userID in line8 Im thinking no but Im not sure. Im sure that userID on line 5 is the same as thisuserID on line 12 and line 15 but what about on line 8 and 10 I am confused. If the variable userID on line 8 is NOT blank, then you are assigning userID found on line 5 to the floatval of userID on line 8 I have a feeling that these are 2 different userIDs. Why couldnt this guy just use a different word if thats the case LOLp  pNOTE Ive been learning PHP for less than a week so these will seem like basic conceptual questions more than anything.

Negative 84213 pi am using mpich21.4.1p1 on windows 7 and i want to use the function MPIPublishname and MPILookupname in a clientserver application using visual c, when i tried those functions, it worked only if the server and the client are in the same programrun by the same mpiexec, but when i separate the client and the server, MPILookupname couldnt find the port associated with the name service given by MPIPublishname. so, im thinking that maybe there is a scope for the name service, it means that if the two jobs are in the same program it work, otherwise, there is no publication  of the service name. i dont know if this is right so, could any one help me with this problem and clarify to me the scope of the name service in mpich2 and if there is another implementation of MPI that support this functionnality on windows 7 id like to be know about it and thanks in advance.p
Negative 84213 pOk I wanted to get the communities thoughts on the use of Views in MYSQL vs. in page calculations using php.p  pI am about to start trying to design a page which relies on retrieving data from my database and working out averages and totals based on the data it retrieves. My initial thoughts were that I should retrieve it in the normal way as if I were going to display each record and then calculate the averages and totals in php before displaying. However before I go to the trouble and no doubt hours of tinkering that it will take for an amateur like me to get it working, I wanted to know if it may well be worth setting up a view instead and just retrieve the information from that with a simple select commandp  pThe data that it will be working the avergaes and totals out for is updated weekly and in an ideal world I would want my averages and total to be year to date until the end of the first year, at which point a total will continue running but a new year to date would commence.p  pAny ideas or suggestions would be great.p  pAlan.p

Negative 84213 pI have a webcrawler where the basic layout is a manager that runs agents that open connection, fetch the content and insert it in a database. p  pEach one of these agents run in a separate thread in a loop until the user send a stop signal.

Negative 84213 pIm experiencing some odd behavior in my HTTP requests.

Negative 84213 pI coded a universal app for Iphone and Ipad, it works perfectly fine on both simulators and on an Iphone device. When I try to run the app on an Ipad, many images are black, and some images do not load fully they are black in parts  it seems to be where the images are the most complicated, a bunch of different colours, etc. I have no warnings or build errors and I have analyzed the code and cleared all memory leaks I could find. I made sure the titles of my images are also casesensitive. The Ipad will also occasionally load some images and then they will be black the next time they are loaded. The app works fine, and it does not work slowly,  it seems cannot display the images to the screen. I use the same images for the Iphone and they all display. All my images are PNG format, and I have tried building it both with compressing the PNG files in build settings, and not compressing them. I have cleaned my projects as well, and deleted and readded the app to the device. I cant find an answer to my problem online. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks a lot  p

Negative 84213 pMy company is transitioning from Visual Source Safe to Subversion our pipeline management tools rely on the existence of the shadow folder that VSS provides in order to move code from version control out to the various test environments. Note we use an interpreted language and translate our source code into object code  currently, both source and object code are under version control specifically for the needs of the pipeline management machinery.p  pAs an iterative step, I am trying to mimic the shadow folder feature with a bit of flair in that Im looking to kick off translation upon commit, so that we need not store both source and object code in Subversion. Note I had to hack the process from performing a clean build of everything to just translate the affected files during the commit, though, because it otherwise took too long to be a realtime commit operation in the future I expect we will drop this process in favor of something a little less interactive, e.g. hourly builds or whatnot.p  pAll of this backstory is simply to ask the question how does the user.dir property get setupp  pThis is my postcommit hook batch file everything is done on Windowsp  precodeSET REPO1 SET REV2  FOR  IN REPO DO SET REPONAMEn  SET BUILDROOTEbuilds IF NOT EXIST BUILDROOT  MKDIR BUILDROOT  SET BUILDDIRBUILDROOTREPONAME IF NOT EXIST BUILDDIR  MKDIR BUILDDIR  CD BUILDDIR  ECHO CD ECHO BUILDDIR  Capacheant1.8.3binant f Cdevshadowbuild.xml DWorkingDirBUILDDIRbuildworkdir DSvnRepoUrlfileREPO DFromRevisionREV gt BUILDDIRlastbuildresult.txt 2gtamp1 codepre  pthe last line is the actual Ant call you can see that Im redirecting the output to a file, which lives in the BUILDDIR, or Ebuilds.

I understand that SVN kicks off the postcommit hook with an a hrefhttpsvnbook.redbean.comen1.1ch05s02.html relnofollowempty environmenta, but I would expect that changing the directory within it should preserve the state once kicking off Ant.p  pLater, in my Ant script, I setup my build.dir property thuslyp  precodeltproperty namebuild.dir valueuser.dir.build.build.time gt lt delete the build.dir, just in case we attempt a new build within the same minute...

Clearly, based on my experimentation, something is getting crossed between the initial setup within the batch file and the invocation of Java with regards to the working directory. p  pDoes Ant change the working directory to the build files location I did not find any documentation to suggest it does, but its possible I simply overlooked something.

Negative 84213 pI have a custom stack based language that Im trying to compile to CIL, so it can be JITed.  The language itself is fairly simple, as it only has integers and booleans.  Each data type has a dedicated stack, however.  The language itself is a stream of commands, where each command can peek, push, andor pop values from either stack.  The number of integers or booleans pushedpoped by a command never changes so the commands have fixed arity.  Theres also a flat integer array that the language reads and writes values to, representing external memory.  The stacks themselves can be arbitrarily deep.p  pFor simple commands like add, subtract, etc., translating the integer stack commands to CIL is almost trivially easy the CIL stack can wholesale replace the integer stack although I have a side question is there a limit on how deep the CIL stack can be, either in spec or in practice  However theres also commands like StoreIfTrue, which will only store a value from the integer stack to the flat integer array at some index the index also from the integer stack if the top value of the boolean stack is true.  So I need access to the boolean stack and the integer stack simultaneously for some of the commands.p  pRight now I have to maintain a System.Collections.Generic.Stack to represent the boolean stack.  But Im wondering if theres a known algorithm or method to flatten the two stack model of my custom language in to a single stack model thatd be more directly compatible with CIL.p

However, I dont understand the benefit of the before block. If only the save test requires the stub, why not just keep the code in the test instead of moving it to a before block that runs before each testp  p2 More fundamentally, does the before block interfere with what the creation test is specifying  The creation test says that Message should receive new with some parameters and then tests that with the post create.  But if the before block just stubs out the call to new, doesnt that short circuit the shouldreceive assertion in the creation test  Perhaps Im not understanding how stub and shouldreceive interact.  p

Negative 84213 pI just got a project in my Computer Science class. We got the assignment to use a Password Decryption solution provided by our teachers, and adapt it to be used across our network in a MasterSlave relationship.p  pThis means that a Master Server have to contact dormant Slaves Clients. We are kind of confused here, as we want to use multiple slaves to decrypt the encrypted passwords we got, but we cant design a system in which the Server is the one to initiate connection to the clients rather than the clients initiating connection to the server.p  pWe have to send the Slaves a list of Encrypted Passwords and make them send back results by comparing them to an encrypted version of a dictionary.p  pWe discussed treating the Master as a Client and the Slaves as Servers, but this would be a problem since you cant stream to different servers through the same port. You would have to change the ports. If this is the only solution then so be it. Any helpp

Whats wrong with it  How can i get access to OPTIONNAME token value Thanks in advance.p  pUPD. Flex part works fine. printfyylval.valchar return OPTIONNAME gives right token value to console. Perhaps problem in bison part.p

Negative 84213 pI have a codeWindows Formcode that contains only codebuttonscode. The final goal is to make a simple logic game I saw but for now the problem is that I want to perform different actions when my codeNewcode button is clicked, but now it is part from all the codebuttonscode in the form so sometimes an action is performed on him too which should not happen. To make myself clear I have two screenshots p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com05731.png altenter image description herep  pSo this is how I want it to be  I have a matrix  3x3 in this case, at the end it can be codeNxNcode.

What happens now is sometimes my codeNewcode button also get painted because I go over the buttons like this p  precode foreach Control c in this.Controls                                                       if c is Button                                               ... codepre  pand thus sometimes codeNewcode get selected too, so I end up with thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVSDRV.png altenter image description herep  pWhat Im thinking right now is just to perform check whenever I need in the code and exclude my codeNewcode button explicitly but I dont think its a good way cause I may end up with a code doing this thing in a lot of places in my program so what is the right solution in this case If some code is needed please ask.p

Negative 84213 pAfter the user requests to delete a file through a context menu, a DialogFragment is triggered to ask the user to confirm. If the user does confirm, the file is deleted by the calling Activity.p  pThere are at least two ways for doing this.p  ol liThe DialogFragment calls deleteFile, a method in the Activity, itself accessible through getActivity.li liThe Activity implements a DeleteFile interface. The DialogFragment sets up a Uri, initializes the listener to be the Activity, and sends a message to the listener. For additional safety, onAttach confirms that the Activity does implement the requisite interface.li ol  pThe a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidecomponentsfragments.htmlEventCallbacks relnofollowdocumentationa suggests that the second option is superior, at least generally. But in this case the first approach seems perfectly robust no matter when the user has triggered a rotation which resets both the Activity and the DialogFragment.p  pIs the first approach perfectly adequate, or is there a scenario other than rotation that makes the second approach better.p

Our admin assistant has collected our preference of who to share rooms with, and now she has to decide how to arrange rooms to minimize the required number of room. Everyone will be arranged to share a room with somebody he or she would like to. For example, there are only colleagues, Allen would like to share a room with Bob or Chris, Bob would like to share with Chris, and Chris would like to share with Allen then the only result will be Allen and Chris share a room, and Bob uses a room alone, and in totall, 2 rooms are needed.p  h1Questionh1  pTo simplify the story as an algorithm question which may not be the best simplification though we have a few nodes in a graph, and the nodes connect to each other. We only care about nodes that are bidirectionally connected, so now we have an undirectional graph. How to divide the nodes in the undirectional graph into groups so that 1 any group contains at most 2 nodes, 2 if a group contains 2 nodes, the nodes are connected, 3 the number of the groups is minimized.p  h1Algorithmh1  pWhat comes over my head is to solve the question greedily. In every step of arrangement, just remove one isolated node or two nodes so that the number of edges remain in the graph is maximized. By doing so repeatedly, we will find a solution finally.p  pemPlease either solve the question in an optimal way and I am not looking for a way to try all combinations or prove the greedy algorithm described above is optimal.emp

When I make the function call Im getting a return code that indicates that there is a problem with an internal variable, which makes me think Ive passed the wrong pointers. Its vague. My question is, under what circumstances should I use codectypes.byrefcode to pass as a reference.  For example, lets say I have the followingp  precodedoublematrix  ctypes.cdouble  100  100 myarray  doublematrix codepre  pShould I pass myarray or ctypes.byrefmyarrayp  precodemystring  ctypes.createstringbufferHello world codepre  pWhat about an object created using types.createstringbuffer Should I pass mystring or ctypes.byrefmystring if passing by reference is requiredp  pEditp  pI dont have the code for the DLL.p  pFunction prototype looks basically like this except there are about 5 or 6 of each type.p  pint processchar input, int indicator, double dmatrix[100][100], int groups[100]p  pThanksp
Negative 84213 pOur company programs and runs data analysis on a Linux server.  The programming is done in Windows clients SAS, generally.  Each project is only programmed by one person and is reviewed by another. p  pWe would like to put our projects under version control but leave the code on the server ie not pulling to local Windows repositories.  The advantage is incremental backup and helps with confirming changes from the reviewer.p  pDoes anyone know of a Windows client that can read remote repositories but perform GIT actions using GIT on Linux, rather than on Windows  Trying a few clients e.g. SourceTree and SmartGIT suggests only the latter is possible.p  pThanks, Richp

Negative 84213 pWe are using Crystal Reports and have a report with a dynamic picklist. If I load it under a 32 bit process, I get the picklist properly populated. If I instead run it under a 64 bit process, I instead get an empty picklist and a textbox where the user can type in whatever they feel like and add it to the selection. I have a discussion on the SAP support site at a hrefhttpscn.sap.comthread3342435 relnofollowhttpscn.sap.comthread3342435a, but so far it has not yielded any solution.

Negative 84213 pI need to know if two strings match where matching basically means that there is significant overlap between the two strings.  For example, if string1 is foo and string2 is foobar, this should be a match.  If string2 was barfoo, that should also be a match with string1.  However, if string2 was fobar, this should not be a match.  Im struggling to find a clever way to do this.

Negative 84213 pIve read a few discussions about which thread calls various callback methods, for example those associated with Sensors. Most claim that the UI thread calls the callbacks  even when a separate worker thread is involved. Are we CERTAIN about thatp  pConsider this scenario A separate class implements Runnable and SensorListener. The UI thread during onCreate starts the runnable and then goes back to its other business. The nowindependent worker thread, in its own class, then registers the SensorListener.p  pNote that the UI thread never has any interaction with SensorManager nor SensorListener. The only thread that ever touches anything to do with Sensor, and the only class and member methods that it ever knows about, is the worker thread and its class.p  pIts hard for me to imagine that the UI thread would be calling the callback in this situation. Yet the online discussions are pretty confident. Anyone know for certainp  pThanksp

Negative 84213 pIn Xlib Im using the XDefineCursor function to change the mouse pointer to a variety of cursors that Im generating from the XCreatePixmapCursor function.  Im finding that the cursor does indeed change as expected, but when it does so a strange flashingflickering occurs between cursor changes, where the cursor quickly and erratically jitters in place before reappearing in the proper position.  It happens really fast but its pretty noticeable.  Is it possible to have a smooth transition between cursor changes  Or am I doing something incorrectly  Thanksp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI think that the hotspots used during the Pixmap cursor definitions are related to this issue.  Each cursor Im using has its own unique hotspot associated to itself depending on the way the cursor looks.  I found that when I simply set all the hotspot values to 0, 0 that the flickering goes away.  Unfortunately, this means I have incorrect hotspots for the cursors.  Exp  precode before, causes flicker cursor1pointer  XCreatePixmapCursordpy, cursor1source, cursor1source,   ampforegroundcolor, ampbackgroundcolor, 16, 15   after, no flicker cursor1pointer  XCreatePixmapCursordpy, cursor1source, cursor1source,   ampforegroundcolor, ampbackgroundcolor, 0, 0 codepre  pIm guessing that Xlib is attempting to reposition the cursor based on its new hotspot during the change.  Unfortunately, it doesnt appear to be doing so in a visually graceful way.  Any ideasp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI figured out a semiclunky trick to prevent this flickering.  Basically, I edited the cursor image files to all have a sufficiently large and shared canvas size, and then repositioned each cursor image within this space such that all cursors used in the program could share a common hotspot pixel coordinate 16, 16.  That way when Xlib updates the cursor, it doesnt have to reposition the cursor according to the new images hotspot, allowing for a semismooth visual transition.p  pNot the most elegant solution, but it works.p

Negative 84213 pI have a circular grid of 2700 cells that represent the face of a detector.  This grid is live, constantly updating, so we need to find clusters of hits with a couple microseconds. p  pEach cell is either a hit or a miss 0 or 1, and a cluster is a grouping of these hit cells that has a distinct perimeter.  I want to count the number of clusters of hit cells very quickly so that we can save the data from events with a certain number of clusters 2 and toss out everything else.p  pSome algorithms currently in use rely on assigning a value for the number of hit neighbors to the cell.  This is too slow because it requires all of the hit crystals to be identified before the clusters may be identified.  Another, much prettier algorithm that works in parallel is based on the number of turns around a given perimeter of a cluster.

Jenkins started the test by executing the rake file. p  pSo this seems to be a rake problem with the newest chromedriver im guess as it worked prior to upgrading. Question is still out there though as to fix this problemp  pDoes anybody have any ideas why this is happeningp

Outside of removing the data from the cell, in which case the cell returns to the color of the row, any further use of the cell returns its background to the first cell specific color it had and the trigger no longer fires.p  pp  precode                ltDataGridTextColumn.ElementStylegt                     ltStyle TargetTypeTextBlockgt                         ltSetter PropertyForeground ValueBlue gt                         ltStyle.Triggersgt                             ltDataTrigger ValueTruegt                                 ltDataTrigger.Bindinggt                                     ltMultiBinding ConverterStaticResource watchNameConverter ConverterParameter1gt                                         ltBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource Self PathTextgtltBindinggt                                         ltBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorTypexType DataGridCell, AncestorLevel1  Path. gt                                         ltBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource Self Path.gtltBindinggt                                     ltMultiBindinggt                                 ltDataTrigger.Bindinggt                                 ltSetter PropertyBackground ValuePurplegt                                 ltSetter PropertylocalScheduler.IsDirty ValueTrue gt                             ltDataTriggergt                              ltTrigger PropertylocalScheduler.IsDirty Valuetruegt                                 ltSetter PropertyBackgroundgt                                     ltSetter.Valuegt                                         ltMultiBinding ConverterStaticResource colorTextConverter gt                                             ltMultiBinding.Bindingsgt                                                 ltBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorTypexType DataGridCell, AncestorLevel1  Path. gt                                             ltMultiBinding.Bindingsgt                                         ltMultiBindinggt                                     ltSetter.Valuegt                                 ltSettergt                              ltTriggergt                         ltStyle.Triggersgt                      ltStylegt                 ltDataGridTextColumn.ElementStylegt             ltDataGridTextColumngt codepre

Negative 84213 pIm using tablesorter Jquery plugin to sort my  tables. This works normally when the table size is less 500 rows.

Negative 84213 pIve never used AJAX since it was never a necessity, but I am considering learning AJAX since it seems to make things a lot easier and generally make websites flow a bit better from my understanding. Despite having a general sense of the advantages of AJAX, Im not too familiar with how it would function within the confines of an online storefront.p  pRight now, some of my pages function as the belowp  precodelogin.php POSTs data to loginsubmit.php, which redirects to index.php cart.php POSTs data to checkout1.php checkout1.php is then followed by checkout2.php, checkout3.php basically any page that deals with SQL has a separate submit.php page my current storefront has 101 .php pages, about 45 are submit.php pages catalogue.php must POST to cart.php every time an item is added this means time is lost when youre adding many items to cart codepre  pMy understanding is that utilizing AJAX means no redirection needs to happen eg. codelogin.php submits data to itselfcode, meaning less pages are needed, particularly no need for an interstitial codesubmit.phpcode page. More importantly, an application I can think of is not having codecatalogue.phpcode codePOSTcode data to codecart.phpcode every time you click Add to cart instead you could click Add to cart and remain on the same page since you could just store in codeSESSIONcode the item in question on the same page.p  pIs this the only benefit AJAX would provide in such a sitep  pedit to further clarify, some of the things I think AJAX would do for my site are belowp  precodesubmit.php page code is the same, but executed onclick of a form button without redirects drops overall page count of site by almost half similar for the cart, allow users to remain on the same page and add stuff to cart rather than adding to cart, back button, adding to cart, back button, etc codepre  pAm I right in assuming AJAX can accomplish this My overall code remains largely unchanged, but with the addition of AJAX I can expect a more fluid experience.p

The app is not really coded on the Ubuntu platform, but I am in my comfort zone there, and have tried both CentOS and OpenSUSE both are sort of native for the app for getting it working with the same or worse results.

It doesnt list dependencies in any coherent way or provide much of any detail does not even mention Zend once on the entire page so Ive done a lot of work to divine the information I do have. This page provided some dependency inf though again, Zend is not mentioned once a hrefhttpsopenfisma.atlassian.netwikidisplayPUBLICRPMManagementRPMManagementBasicOverviewofRPMPackages relnofollowhttpsopenfisma.atlassian.netwikidisplayPUBLICRPMManagementRPMManagementBasicOverviewofRPMPackagesap  pAnyway, I got all the way through the install so far as I could reconstruct it. I am going to the login page for the first time, and there should be some sort of bootstrapping occurring when I load the page. I am not a programmer so I have no idea what it is doing there. Anyway, I get a message on the web page that says An exception occurred while bootstrapping the application.p  pSo, then I go look in varwwwdatalogsphp.log and find this message p  precode[22Oct2013 172918 UTC] PHP Fatal error  Uncaught exception ZendException with message No entry is registered for key ZendLog in varwwwlibraryZendRegistry.php147 Stack trace 0 varwwwpublicindex.php188 ZendRegistrygetZendLog 1 main   thrown in varwwwlibraryZendRegistry.php on line 147 codepre  pThis occurs every time I load the page. I gather there is an issue related to registering the ZendLog variable in the Zend registry, but other than that I really have no idea what to do about it. Am I missing a package that it needs, or is this app not coded to register the variables properly I have no clue. Any help is greatly appreciated.

This means that it will also scroll back up if youre scrolled down in that second. This is clearly the fault of the code executing once per second on an interval, however, only the lines that remove the classes from the unrelated DOM elements cause the issue to present.p  pNonChromium browsers Ive tested of which, I mean IE9 and Firefox have had no problems with the very same markupCSSJS. I also tried xombrero, and it doesnt seem like WebKit inherently carries the same issue. Im using Windows 7 Pro. My Chrome has no extensions installed outside of Google Docs and Im not sure when that got there and the same issue appears on both Comodo and Opera 17.p  pDoes anyone have an idea of whats going on here Am I using something like a fool, is there a bug in jQuery that causes this for Chromium only somehow, or is this just a really strange Chromium behaviorp

Negative 84213 pI have been doing some work with the canvas using JavaScript and I have noticed the FPS in Chrome seems to cap out at 60fps until such point as opening the inspector up the dev tools accessed from right clicking and clicking Inspect Element.p  pIf I run my own code in other browsers there is no FPS issues, likewise if I run in Chrome when the inspector tools are open there is no issue, it instantly shoots up to 120 frames per second.p  pAs a means of showing a practical example, take a look at this page a hrefhttpmbostock.github.iod3talk20111018collision.html relnofollowhttpmbostock.github.iod3talk20111018collision.htmlap  pIf I view this page without my inspector tools open, the FPS graph shows between 40 and 60 frames per second. However, as soon as the inspector is open, the FPS instantly jumps to 120 FPS again and is visually and physically more responsive.p  pIm really struggling to understand why this is and ideally would like to have my code running as if the inspector window was open. As essentially the amount of time being given for processing seems to be dropping by a substantial amount.p  pIs this a known limit of code being executed in a nondebugging environmentp  pAny insight would be much appreciated, thank you p

Negative 84213 pSo, Im trying to do readonly access of a zip file in Java, decompressing in a multithreaded manner, because my standard simple singlythreaded solution of ZipFileZipEntry using the enumeration and inputstreams and whatnot results in it taking about five full seconds just to decompress into memory a 50meg zipfile which takes one second AT MOST for my disk to read without decompressing.p  pHowever, the entire Java zip library is synchronized to an incrediblyobnoxious degree, no doubt because its all abstracted for readingwritingetc. in the same code instead of having nice efficient nonsynchronized readonly code.p  pIve looked at thirdparty Java libraries, and all of them are either massive VFS libraries that are worse than using an elephant gun to shoot a fly, or else the only reason they have a performance benefit is they multithread to the extent that most of the threads are blocking on disk IO anyway.p  pAll I want to do is pull a zipfile into a byte[], fork some threads, and work on it. Theres no reason any synchronization would be needed in any way for anything, because each of the unzipped files I use separately in memory without interaction.p  pWhy must this be so difficultp

Negative 84213 pIm trying to move from a serial to parallel approach to accomplish some multivariate time series analysis tasks on a large codedata.tablecode.  The table contains data for many different groups and Im trying to move from a codeforcode loop to a codeforeachcode loop using the codedoParallelcode package to take advantage of the multicore processor installed.p  pThe problem I am experiencing relates to memory and how the new R processes seem to consume large quantities of it.  I think that what is happening is that the large codedata.tablecode containing ALL data is copied into each new process, hence I run out of RAM and Windows starts swapping to disk.p  pIve created a simplified reproducible example which replicates my problem, but with less data and less analysis inside the loop.  It would be ideal if a solution existed which could only farm out the data to the worker processes on demand, or sharing the memory already used between cores.  Alternatively some kind of solution may already exist to split the big data into 4 chunks and pass these to the cores so they have a subset to work with.p  pA similar question has previously been posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18028452readingglobalvariablesusingforeachinrlq1here on Stackoverflowa however I cannot make use of the codebigmemorycode solution offered as my data contains a character field.

Negative 84213 pSo I asked something similar to this earlier and got the answer to the question I asked, but I apparently didnt ask the right question. So, what Im trying to accomplish here is have the text area populate only in the center of the jFrame. As you can see, it is set up as a borderlayout, and there are buttons on the bottom, a label on the top which will then  on the full version of this program  be copied into the text frame when it is replaced with text from the action listener on the buttonp  pThe problem is, the text area fills the entire window and covers up every other component on the window. Ive tried to use preferred size, and I tried to specify columnsrows and Ive read the tutorials on docs.oracle, although I suppose since Im still having trouble i may have missed one.p  pAlso, the offset commented lines I found in the docs.oracle information and it would be a good idea for this to textwrap because its going to be a log of what has occurred. I tried adding all the imports suggested on that website but netbeans still gives me a red underline that theyre not recognized as commands.

Negative 84213 pI have data that has come over from a hierarchical database, and it often has columns that contain data that SHOULD be in another table, if the original database had been relational.p  pThe columns data is formatted in pairs, with codeLABELVALUEcode with a space as the delimiter, like thisp  blockquote   pLABEL1VALUE LABEL2VALUE LABEL3VALUEp blockquote  pThere is seldom more than one pair in a record, but there as many as three.  There are 24 different possible Labels. There are other columns in this table, including the ID.  I have been able to convert this column into a sparse array without using a cursor, with columns for ID, LABEL1, LABEL2, etc....p  pBut this is not ideal for using in another query.  My other option it to use a cursor, loop through the entire table once and write to a temp table, but I cant see to get it to work the way I want.  I have been able to do it in just a few minutes in VB.NET, using a couple of nested loops, but cant manage to do it in TSQL even using cursors.  Problem is, that I would have to remember to run this program every time before I want to use the table it creates.

Negative 84213 pIm trying to create an anonymous union that holds a generic vector in order to use it as a member in a class without naming the typename of the union itself.p  pSo that I could call the vector inside the class as followingp  precodevec.size codepre  pBut my approachp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt union   stdvectorltTgt vec  codepre  pwill only give me the error strongtemplate class without a namestrong. This also happens with structures. So does it not like to be anonymous when it is generic p  pSearch results just gave me the option to create a generic vector inside a named structure but, besides I couldnt get this to work either, I would loose the benefits of the anonymous union und I would need to call the vector e.g. asp  precodestructname.vec.size codepre  por evenp  precodeclassname.structname.vec.size codepre  pwhich I tried to avoid.p  pI want to make the vector generic so that it can store integers or doubles and I dont need to declare two different vectors with their own specific data types.

Negative 84213 pIm using the reachability feature of AFNetworking 2.0 as outlined in their sample code  I have a test server in the local LAN that my iOS App communicates with during testing. When I run the app in the simulator with WLAN on, AFNetworking initially reports that the serverURL is reachable, but then changes it back to not reachable even though the server is there, reachable and WLAN is working fine.

Negative 84213 pI have a stored procedure which returns me some dates, as well as an Id which related to a specific row in a table.p  pBasically, I am getting a list of all scheduled transactions for all accounts within an account portfolio.p  pThe stored procedure returns a row with an Id for the scheduled transaction, and some dates which I have minded within the proc.p  pIf my query began withp  precodefrom p in Context.scheduledtransactions codepre  pthen this plan would have worked. But I dont want to get the items like that, because in the proc, I am doing a lot of work to create business dates etc. So, instead of bring back the EF model  my proc just brings back the ID. I was HOPING to do something like thisp  precodevar trans  from p in Context.getscheduledpaymentsbyportfolioportfolioId                                           .Includeaccount                                           .Includecostcentre                                           .Includezaccounttransactiontype                                           .Includezpaymentfrequencytype                                           .Includetransactionsubcategory                                           .Includetransactionsubcategory.transactioncategory                                           .Includethirdparty                          select p.ToList codepre  pBut, the EF cant use Include as it doesnt know what I am bring back. Although the id is called scheduledtransactionid in the proc  EF doesnt know that understandably.p  pIs there a way I can tell EF that the ID is for a scheduledtransactionmodel  and then use the Includep  pMaybe I need to just call the proc, which returns me a list of my objects, which has the scheduledtransactionid, and all the dates I calculated in the proc, and then somehow, use that Listlt in another linq query that can join the other tablesp  pEDIT I might be onto something This doesnt show a syntax error.

Negative 84213 pThis is hard to explain but ill try my best. I have a Table View controller that leads to 10 View controller. All the View controllers have a navigation bar title The titles are the 10 objects from the Table view controller. Now i want to add the Swipe Gesture for a easier navigation between the 10 table view items Instead of going back to the Table view manually i want the user to be able to swipe to change from a view controller to another. HERES THE PROBLEM When i add the Swipe Gesture and i connect it from one view to another, it asks if i want the action to be either Push, Modal or custom. Now, if i choose one of them, it makes the navigation bar title disappear. I want to keep the title without messing up the connection from the table view to the views controller. Thanks.p

Negative 84213 pIm using an asyncronous message receiver in SpringAMQP to receive messages. Currently only messages with JSON content are handled, but I have a requirement to also handle messages with XML content. My current implementation of codeMessageListenercode has a codeMessageConvertercode injected and uses it in codeonMessageMessagecode, like thisp  precodeMyMessage myMessage  MyMessage jsonConverter.fromMessagemessage codepre  pIn order to support different content types I could obviously use the codeMessagePropertiescode to interrogate the contenttype header and manually select a converter to use. But that seems like a lot of work, like Spring should provide some better support for this scenario. I was hoping to find a generic codeMessageConvertercode implementation that would map from contenttypes to specific converters, but there doesnt seem to be such a thing.p  pIs my best option to write a delegating converter like that Or is there a way to configure the codeListenerContainercode to support both async receiving emandem multiple converters that are automatically used as neededp

Negative 84213 pWe have a WCF service hosted on IIS 7.5 which has custom username authentication using a custom membership provider we authenticate users from a database with some custom logic. The service uses WsHttpBinding with TransportWithMessageCredentials security mode.p  pIt works well with heavy loads but sometimes for about 69 minutes it keeps the requests waiting for 69 minutes before responding. I added debug logs to the custom authentication module and the service operation that was being called and noticed that for these instances, there was this lag of 69 minutes between the end of execution of the authentication module and start of execution of the service method.p  pThe requests responds after these 69 minutes correctly. It looks like they got stuck somewhere between the authentication and actual service method call, but I have got no clue as to what is causing it. This is becoming a problem as the service clients are getting timed out during these periods.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I enabled the service trace and observed that for the requests that were getting delayed, there was this delay between the Received a message over a channel. and the Understood message header. events.

Negative 84213 pIn a new activity I am writing I want to dynamically layout and populate part of the layout.p  pWhat I have so far is a main layout with an empty layout element say a LinearLayout. And I have a layout file for an element of dynamic content lets say a LinearLayout containing a Spinner and 2 buttons with their own ids.p  pI can inflate the dynamic content elements fine, and add them into the LinearLayout. And by calling findViewbyId on the inflated LinearLayout I can get references to the UI elements I need for any events etc e.g. setOnClickListener.p  precodeViewGroup group  ViewGroupfindViewByIdR.id.mydynamiccontentlayoutid Might actually inflate a number of different things, but for simplicity... ViewGroup newContent  ViewGroupView.inflatethis, R.layout.dynamiccontentelement, null group.addViewnewContent  ButtonnewContent.findViewByIdR.id.mybutton.setButtonListener... codepre  pThe problem comes however in getting my dynamic content to persist when the activity is recreated e.g. orientation change. I added some data in onSaveInstanceState so that I can reinflate the views I need, but it seems because of the duplicated ids in the dynamic content that Android messes up the state of the individual UI widgets at some point after onCreate is finished, setting the state of every element with a given id to be that of the last occurrence in the ui tree when onSaveInstanceState was called...p  pI think I need to do more in onSaveInstanceState  onCreate to saverestore everything needed myself. However before I go figure out how to saverestore individual widgets into a Bundle, and likely run into a load of harder issues todo with preserving which element has input focus etc...p  pIs there a better way to be doing this, like some method on a layout to saveload in respect to its tree structure instead e.g. a get Bundle[] from a ViewGroup contain an element for each child in order that works pretty much like the default implementation e.g. nearly completely automatic but handles the duplicated idslayouts properlyp
Negative 84213 pI have some .bmp image files created in Matlab from a logical matrix.

Negative 84213 pIve been running into problems with a C program that Ive been working on recently. Specifically, Ive been working on a program that uses Qts GUI framework and Ive been running into errors that seem to be related to doubledeletion of pointers and exception handling. The issue is that I feel like the API that Im using works in a way that isnt exactly empredictableem and because of that, Im running into a lot of errors that seem counterintuitive. Im not the most experienced C programmer in the world, so maybe there is some overall strategy for working with new APIs that Im missing..p  pHeres an example I typically always try to delete objects that I dynamically allocate with inside the same class. In other words, if I populate a pointer using the emnewem keyword within a class constructor or init function, then I usually make sure to emdeleteem the contents of that pointer in the class destructor.p  pHeres an simplified example of the class definition for the class that was giving me problems [strongMyProject.hstrong]p  precodeifndef MYPROJECTH define MYPROJECTH  include QObject.h class QGuiApplication class QQmlApplicationEngine define MYPROJECT MyProjectgetInstance  class MyProject  public QObject      QOBJECT private     explicit MyProjectQObject parent  0 singleton..     MyProjectMyProject constamp uncopyable..     void operatorMyProject constamp unassignable..     QGuiApplication  QtGUI     QQmlApplicationEngine  QmlAppEngine  public     MyProjectvoid       Globally available function to get MyProjects singleton instance.       You can use the MYPROJECT preprocessor macro for shorthand.      static MyProject amp getInstancevoid              static MyProject instance         return instance           int initint argc, char  argv[]     int execvoid  signals public slots   endif codepre  pThis is what my simplified strongmain.cppstrong looks likep  precodeinclude MyProject.h  int mainint argc, char  argv[]      MYPROJECT.initargc, argv     return MYPROJECT.exec  codepre  pHeres the ctor and init that I initially had for that class [strongMyProject.cppstrong]p  precodeMyProjectMyProjectQObject parent      QObjectparent ,     QtGUINULL ,     QmlAppEngineNULL    MyProjectMyProjectvoid      segfault debug points to both of these..     if QtGUI delete QtGUI     if QmlAppEngine delete QmlAppEngine   int MyProjectinitint argc, char  argv[]      QtGUI  new QGuiApplicationargc, argv     QmlAppEngine  new QQmlApplicationEngine      ifQtGUI ampamp QmlAppEngine              segfault debug points to this..         QmlAppEnginegtloadQUrl QStringLiteralqrcMyProject.qml           else return 1   int MyProjectexecvoid      return QtGUIgtexec  codepre  pSo, my plan was ctor initializes pointers to NULL, init populates those pointers with new objects, and if those pointers are not null the dtor cleans them up with delete. But this code crashes with 2 segfaults, but even though I think Ive narrowed it down, Im not sure I understand why theyre both happening.p  p1 Segfault 1 is a crash on startup that points to the QmlAppEngineload call inside the init. I was able to prevent the crash from occurring by wrapping that function call in exception handling code like thisp  precodeint MyProjectinitint argc, char  argv[]      QtGUI  new QGuiApplicationargc, argv     QmlAppEngine  new QQmlApplicationEngine      ifQtGUI ampamp QmlAppEngine              exception handling prevents crash..         try                      QmlAppEnginegtloadQUrl QStringLiteralqrcMyProject.qml                   catchint e                      stdcout ltlt Exception  ltlt e ltlt stdendl             return 1                  return 0          else return 1  codepre  pIm not very familiar with exception handling, as most of the code Ive written so far has used int returncode style error handling. Im guessing that the load function can throw an exception in certain situations, and not handling them can cause a crash. The program stopped crashing on startup once I made this change, but strangely, it didnt seem to actually throw an exception as my cout never output anything.. Something else that I dont understand is that this code is called without any exception handling code in the default setup for brand new Qt Projects that Qt Creator makes  for example, this is what you see when you start a new QtQuick2 project in QtCreator IDEp  precodeinclude QGuiApplication include QQmlApplicationEngine  int mainint argc, char  argv[]      QGuiApplication appargc, argv     QQmlApplicationEngine engine      default Qt file calls this without issue though..     engine.loadQUrl QStringLiteralqrcMyQml.qml       return app.exec  codepre  pThe only major different that I can see here is that the default code uses objects instead of pointers to objects. But, in this case, load runs fine without exception handling code and there is no segfault.. p  p2 The next issue is caused when my dtor calls the delete keyword on those two pointers. If I comment out those two lines, the program runs fine and closes without crashes or issues. This leads me to believe that the API has made these objects delete themselves later, which is causing a segfault due to doubledeletion when I also explicitly call delete. But, in general, how can one know if the API that theyre using is taking care of object deletion internally And, if I cant tell whether or not an API specified object is being deleted automatically, should I take any extra measures i.e. use some kind of smart pointer, etc. Typically I make the assumption that I should emdeleteem any dynamically allocated objects in the destructor of the same class, but clearly that can backfire in situations like this.p  pstrongSo what steps can I take to work with the APIs that I use in a way that a prevents bugs and b allows me to make sure that resources are being freed correctly and exceptions are being handledstrongp

I might try to generate them myself but I dont have enough clients for a significant sample. p  pSo I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on stats around the success rate of using STUN for NAT traversal. How many peers would not be able to connect if I fail to use TURN as fallbackp

Negative 84213 pI am at the beginner level of learning MVC5 using EF6. Basically I am trying to use a connection string defined in machine.config rather than using web.config whilst creating the ADO.NET Entity Data Model.

The credentials are different too. so on each applicationweb server we have defined the ConnectionString in machine.config for the same database name but with different credentials.p  pIs there a way I can use ConnectionString specified in machine.config whilst using the wizard to create ADO.Net Entity Data Model or can I give reference of machine.config ConnectionString to my app web.config or is there any other way to solve this problemp  pI am using Database First technique using MVC5.

Negative 84213 pI am new to brew and have been using it to great effect until now.  I am trying to install pygame, and it is not letting me get past one of the dependencies, codesdlttfcode. I am running OS X 10.9 Mavericks.  The bottom line is that I have now downloaded and successfully installed the package myself but brew still keeps asking for it and failing.  p  pFrom my perspective I have installed the dependency, so brew should let me proceed in the first place.  One option is to convince brew that I have the dependency.  Another option is to help brew install it again so it is happy.  I dont know too much about make, but brew seems to be failing in the codelibtool link clangcode section.

Im sure I have to go down the data trigger route as the style ones are not accepting animations.p  pHere is the dependency property of the buttonp  precode public bool IsShowingInfoPlane              get  return boolGetValueIsShowingInfoPlaneProperty          set                      SetValueIsShowingInfoPlaneProperty, value             OnPropertyChangedIsShowingInfoPlane               codepre  pand here is the data trigger I have tried to attach to the grid in column 1 that I want to animate on its width propertyp  precodeltGrid.Triggersgt     ltDataTrigger BindingTemplateBinding IsShowingInfoPlane ValueTrue gt          ltDataTrigger.EnterActionsgt               ltBeginStoryboardgt                     ltStoryboardgt                          ltDoubleAnimation Duration000.150 FromBinding ElementNameInfoGrid, PathWidth To150 Storyboard.TargetPropertyWidth gt                      ltStoryboardgt                ltBeginStoryboardgt           ltDataTrigger.EnterActionsgt     ltDataTriggergt ltGrid.Triggersgt codepre  pAs Im going to have many of these buttons on the frontend I dont fancy creating individual animations and as Im so far down the road with this button I cant go and use other peoples controls. Ive used animations elsewhere in the program with success but this is the first time ive tried to use them with triggers, usually I can them from code and attach them to some control,  Any help would be much appreciated.p  pRegardsp

The main operations will be looping over part or all the data set in order to run algorithms on the data and one insertion of 20 millions of records once per month but inserting data is not something Im interested in optimizing for.p  pThe ideal solution would have been storing them in a database so that I could query them easily, but some rough calculations showed me that I would need a hrefhttpsgist.github.comframpb5e9d7f7943824fd2d61 relnofollow46GiBa with Postgres which MAYBE could be brought down to 18GiB with some ugly tricks.p  pIve done some a hrefhttpsgist.github.comframp9103a7f1c87b0e87a4d1 relnofollowexperimentsa with the data I have and I found out that     Generating gzipped files containing codeTIMESTAMP,FLOAT1,FLOAT2code would get me to 14GiB     Removing entirely the timestamps would get me down to 5GiBp  pA good way to save space could be storing the timestamp in an efficient way. I was thinking of creating a tree structure where every node contains one digit of the timestamp and where the leafs contain the final digit and the two floats.p  pIve tried looking into solutions like druid.io but it looks like theyre trying to optimize for other things my use case doesnt need.p  pIs there some tool Im missing which does exactly what I want If not, whats an efficient way to store time series datap  pThank youp

Negative 84213 pLets say you have an AABB AxisAligned Bounding Box... a cuboid, basically. You also have a polyhedron a convex shape of undefined form  it can be anything, a cuboid, a sphere, a capsule, all you know is a list of planes that make it up.p  pNow lets say this AABB is a emmovingem object. In fact, its moving at light speed. However, the polyhedron is unmoveable. The AABB is firing straight at the polyhedron, and we need to know where exactly it stops it stops immediately upon contact with the polyhedron.p  pThere is the obvious method of calculating it Cut the movement into a bunch of tiny chunks, step it forward piece by piece, and stop at the spot before the spot in which it intersects the polyhedron. But this is slow and inaccurate.p  pThere is a method which only works feasibly in 2D Take the minkowski difference subtract all points of one object from the other, calculate a convex hull from that, then trace a line into the box. Unfortunately, in 3D, the convex hull is a pretty intense calculation, and cant really be done for every moving object in a world against every static polyhedron, even with a quicklycalculated broad check.p  pSo the question is... whats the proper way to calculate this, that works with perfect or nearperfect accuracy, and works from any distancep  pIs my method the one marked for 2D the correct method, just implemented poorly on my end Is there a better methodp  pIm working in C, though this question should be the same for any language.p  pThis is a 3D question, but heres a 2D diagram to help get the idea acrossp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrpHey.png altenter image description herep

Negative 84213 pWhen securing WCF services with server and client certificates there is an easy way to ensure the identity of the service provider certificate server certificate, by comparing the public key or finger print of the sender certificate with an expected value.p  pOn a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff648360.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff648360.aspxa this is explained in step 8. You can config your app.config file in the endpoint section with an identity element where you can pass in the expected encoded finger print value of the server certificate. A comparison between received service certificate and expected value ensures I am talking to the server I expect.p  pBut now I consider the servers point of view. The server can have several RootCA certificates in its certificate store. If the client certificate send from the requester was issued and signed by one of these RootCA my service will trust this client certificate. How can I ensure that my service will only trust certificates issued by one determined RootCA And how can I configure the one trusted RootCAp  pI think this could be some kind of an equivalent way of certificate pinning for client certificates issued by on RootCAp

Negative 84213 pI have an ObjectiveC project with a large portion of it written in C. Ive also written a C main file in the project which allows the processing done in the C side of things to be run as a standalone without the iOS component.

Yet, AppCode does have the project type to create command line tools. Is there anyway to enable those command line tool configurations inside of an iOS project Thank you muchp

Negative 84213 pSay I have a strongCitizenstrong class and a strongPopulationstrong class. A population contains a set of citizens.p  pIn this simulation, citizens may die. Currently, to represent the death of a citizen, I destroy all references to that citizen object, as a Population may not contain a dead citizen.p  pI want to be able to create multiple Population objects where citizen overlap is possible. Ex. Citizen C may belong to both Population A and Population B. However, this makes citizen deaths difficult as I would have to remove citizen C from both A and B on the event of a death. Sometimes A and B arent even in the same scope.p  pAlso, each citizen must belong to at least one population.p  pGenerally speaking, how would I organize my Population and Citizen class to ensure that a citizen is completely removed from all instances of Population upon that citizens deathp  pIm thinking of making Citizen a member class of Population, but I do not know where to go from there.p  pThanks.p

Negative 84213 pI am trying to use an open source tool built on Batik and I am running into trouble with one of the dependencies when I try to build it. Pretty sure this is something to do with classpaths and library locations, but I cant figure out what is happening.p  pSo the project I am working with  SVG2EMF  is using the FreeHep EMF Driver, which in turn uses the FreeHep GraphicsIO project. Because these three have not been playing nicely on my system  Ubuntu 14.04  Ive downloaded the source for all three to try and step through the problem.p  pEverything builds correctly and I can step through the code successfully, but the unit tests on SVG2EMF fail at the point where the EMF Driver makes a call to something from GraphicsIO the relevant parts of the code in question is herep  precodeimport org.freehep.graphicsio.ImageGraphics2D import org.freehep.graphicsio.ImageConstants  ...snip...  public class AlphaBlend extends EMFTag implements EMFConstants     ...snip...  public void writeint tagID, EMFOutputStream emf throws IOException              emf.writeRECTLbounds         emf.writeLONGx         emf.writeLONGy         emf.writeLONGwidth         emf.writeLONGheight         dwROP.writeemf         emf.writeLONGxSrc         emf.writeLONGySrc         emf.writeXFORMtransform         emf.writeCOLORREFbkg         emf.writeDWORDusage         emf.writeDWORDsize  bmi follows this record immediately         emf.writeDWORDBitmapInfoHeader.size         emf.writeDWORDsize  BitmapInfoHeader.size  bitmap follows bmi          emf.pushBuffer          int encode          plain         encode  BIRGB         ImageGraphics2D.writeImage             RenderedImage image,             ImageConstants.RAW.toLowerCase,             ImageGraphics2D.getRAWPropertiesbkg, BGRA,             new NoCloseOutputStreamemf           emf.writeImageimage, bkg, BGRA, 1          png           encode  BIPNG          ImageGraphics2D.writeImageimage, png, new Properties, new          NoCloseOutputStreamemf          jpg          encode  BIJPEG          ImageGraphics2D.writeImageimage, jpg, new Properties, new          NoCloseOutputStreamemf         int length  emf.popBuffer          emf.writeDWORDlength         emf.writeLONGimage.getWidth         emf.writeLONGimage.getHeight          BitmapInfoHeader header  new BitmapInfoHeaderimage.getWidth, image                 .getHeight, 32, encode, length, 0, 0, 0, 0         bmi  new BitmapInfoheader         bmi.writeemf          emf.append      codepre  pThis throws a codeNoClassDefFoundErrorcode specifically relating to codeorg.freehep.graphicsio.ImageGraphics2Dcode on that codewriteImagecode call. When I step through in the debugger, a watch on codeImageConstants.RAWcode has the value of codeUnknown type org.freehep.graphicsio.ImageConstantscode even though the application built quite happily with those references.

So the dependency does exist, but an exception is being thrown by the initializer which causes the JRE to mark it as unusable.p  pFurther Edit To solve these problems it can be useful  although it is not mentioned anywhere on the freehep.org website  to know that a hrefhttpfreehep.github.iofreehepvectorgraphicsindex.html relnofollowthe project is now hosted on Githuba so you can find newer versions from there. In my case going straight to the latest version solved the problem.p

Negative 84213 pam very new to programming and apologize in advance if I do a poor job of explaining myself.p  pI am creating a GAE application using Python, Webapp2, Jinja2, and jquery. I can update HTML pages by passing string queries via HTML forms, adding the queries to Python dictionaries, and using Jinja2 and Webapp2 to render them and write them out.p  pHowever, when I try using the jquery Ajax post method to make a POST request instead of using the HTML form, my HTML page isnt updating. I am definitely calling the render function from my Python program but it doesnt do anything. p  pAny help or advice that anyone could offer me would be greatly appreciated.

I need to pass through virtually all properties to the inner codeTextBoxcode as you can see I abbreviated it here. Also, Id like the codeWidthcode property to apply to the inner codeTextBoxcode as usual, not to the outer codeGridcode. Think I need a separate property for that and bind the inner codeTextBoxcode instance to that. And currently, the style that I set when using the codeUnitTextBoxcode class is ignored. I dont even know how to solve that.p  pIs there any possibility to create such a combined control with WPF It should act like a codeTextBoxcode with all its event handlers, bindable properties etc., but already include that unit string in its appearance, assignable by an additional property.p  pCould I instead use a custom codeStylecode that adds the codeTextBlockcode somewhere around but I think I need the outer codeGridcode for aligning things, and declare the unit with an attached propertyp

On the main thread I have a UITableView working with an FRC NSFetchedResultsController.p  pOnce in a while I run a massive save operation, that deletes all objects and builds a few hundreds of new objects... At this point I want to UITableView in the main thread to refresh its data using the FRC obviously. Therefore the main MOC registers to the NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification notification received from the background MOC and runs mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification at that stage to make sure the UITableView updates accordingly.p  pThis all works fine until I try to scroll the UITableView during the save operation. When I try to scroll the view a coredata could not fulfill a fault exception is raised. This is the result of the FRC still holding objects that were already deleted while the save operation still runs, before mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification from NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification notification is received on main MOC.  This is some sort of a race condition between the save operation and the update of the UITableView after mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification is received.p  pWhat is the right approach to work with those two MOCs and taking care of the FRC so it will be able to cope with this scenariop

Negative 84213 pI did a payment gateway integration on an existing website. The payment gateway gave me an API which I used and did the coding and stored it in a php file codepay.phpcodep  pI have a checkout form in the main website and on clicking submit, it sends all the needed data to codepay.phpcode via codepostcode and then this file does the rest and sends the data over to the payment gateway.p  pSince this codepay.phpcode file stores sensetive data, I want to secure it so that no one else can access it via web brwoser like entering codehttpdomain.compay.phpcode or be able to download it.p  pNow while I know that normally you cant just download code.phpcode files, I saw a site the other day which was capable of downloading my wordpress blog along with the code.phpcode files.p  pAlso every time the codepay.phpcode file is run a payment link is generated, so  I need to make sure only the website codehttpwww.domain.comcode is able to use this file and no 3rd party.p  pI already have a few ideas in my head like limiting access using remote IP and such but would want to know the best possible way to address the issue.p

Negative 84213 pI have a JTextField that I have overridden the Document for, so that I can prevent the user from entering some characters. The way this works is my extension of Document receives a Regex in its constructor, then checks anything the user types against the Regexp  precodepublic class ValidDocument extends PlainDocument      private String regex      public ValidDocumentString regex              this.regex  regex           Override     public void insertStringint offs, String str, AttributeSet a              ifstr  null return          try                      ifthis.getText0, getLength  str.matchesregex                 super.insertStringoffs, str, a                  catchBadLocationException ble                      System.out.printlnCame across a BadLocationException                codepre  pI had an issue however, where a JTextField that I wanted to display only valid floatdouble numbers in wasnt displaying its initial value. The code I was using is belowp  precodefloat value  25.0f JTextField textField  new JTextField  value textField.setDocumentnew ValidDocumentd.d codepre  pSo the JTextField displayed, but there was no initial value. I tried to enter 25.0 into the field and it accepted it I had originally expected it would. After a bit of stuffing around, I tried addingp  precodetextField.setText  value codepre  pAnd it displayed the value. It occurred to me that it might accept anything I tried to put in setText, so I added alphabetic characters to itp  precodetextField.setTextas  value codepre  pAs I suspected, it included the alphabetic characters, even though the Regex should have prevented that. So my thoughts are that the Document is bypassed when using this function. p  pCan anyone shed some light on why applying the ValidDocument to my JTextField is removing the text I placed in the constructor of the text field I have other JTextFields with less restrictive Regexs that still display the value I set in the constructor. And why would it be overriding the value passed into the constructor, but not the one passed into setTextp
Negative 84213 pI am editing a Prestashop installation and have a slightly odd situation. In PS when you add a colour attribute to a product it shows an codeltagtcode tag with a background colour to show the colour choices. In the shop I am building for an art supplier, we are having one product per colour of paint so there is no need for this however some products will have an image of the texture and others will have a photograph showing the texture as not all of them will be a solid block of colour.p  pThe whole scenario is a little more complex than above however my question is can you use the schema.orgProduct image attributes on a tag which is empty but has a background colourp  pThe resulting code would be something like this wrapped in codeltdiv classproductcontainer itemscope itemtypehttpschema.orgProductgtcodep  precodelta hreflinktoproduct itempropimage stylebackgroundcolorFF0000 width 25px height25pxgtltagt codepre  pI dont think it would be wise to delve into rewriting how Prestashop deals with Product Attributes for colours and other options because that would involve a certain kind of hell from what I have seen. The alternative is to leave the schema attributes out for those that dont have images but I would like to get it in there if possible. For those that dont know Prestashop, when you set product attributes you can choose a hexcode colour and an optional image file. If the image is not present then only the colour will show.p

Negative 84213 pI created a new ASP .Net MVC 5 project with all the sample views, controllers and such. It has the latest versions of jQuery and Bootstrap.p  pSo I wanted to have a nice template on it so I downloaded a hrefhttposwd.copreviewmetamorphhighway relnofollowthis onea and I added the images and css files to the content folder, modified the BundleConfig class so that the new css file is included and also changed ViewStart.cshtml file so that it takes the new layout which I named myLayout.cshtml.p  pTechnically it worked very well since all the pages now use the new layout template but it is not rendering properly, the menu looks truncated, the header image and the content section are going outside of the border on the right side, and the footer is displayed with a margin at the bottom which should not exist.p  pI have been able to pinpoint the problem to a collision between the templates css and bootstrap since if I remove the bootstrap stylesheet from the BundleConfig file and then styles got rendered as expected.p  pI am more of a backendjavascript developer so my knowledge about css is very limited and I am way over my head with this one. So much that I dont even know which code to include and both css files are too large to include them in the question.p  pIf anyone is able to help I would really appreciate it andor if someone can provide some clues as to which css sections would be useful to include in the post to help pinpoint the problem please let me know.p  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pTo replicate the problem you would have tobr  Download a hrefhttposwd.copreviewmetamorphhighway relnofollowthe template I mentioned aboveabr  Create a new ASP .Net MVC 5 projectbr  Add the images and styles.css file from the template on the projects content folderbr  On the projects Shared folder create a new layout page called myLayout.cshtmlbr  Do the following changes on these filesp  pBundleConfig.csp  precodeusing System.Web using System.Web.Optimization  namespace SC.Web      public class BundleConfig               For more information on bundling, visit httpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId301862         public static void RegisterBundlesBundleCollection bundles                      bundles.Addnew ScriptBundlebundlesjquery.Include                         Scriptsjqueryversion.js              bundles.Addnew ScriptBundlebundlesjqueryval.Include                         Scriptsjquery.validate               Use the development version of Modernizr to develop with and learn from.

Negative 84213 pIm creating a multilingual control in VisualStudio 2010, .net 3.5.  Direction from above is to use a resource designer class created by the StronglyTypedResourceBuilder, which basically protects the developer from i.e. abstracts the ResourceManager.GetStringString,CultureInfo function.p  pOne thing that I have noticed about the designer class is that the current Culture property is a static variable internal static Culture and therefore shared by everyone using that class.  Also, when accessing strings the getters do not let one specify a culture it uses the static property.p  pQuestion  Aside from reverting to the ResourceManager.GetString way of doing things...  is there any way that I can have one control get a string from the resource designer class in English, and another get a string in Spanish  I want finegrained control of which Controls show English and which show Spanish thats my issue.p  pI understand that I can set the static property Culture before each access, but a thats a pain, and b with multiple controls hitting this resource file at the same time, thread safety and timing issues arise.p

Negative 84213 pIve read similar questions on SO about how to do this, but my setup is slightly different and the solutions proposed on those questions, have produced a strange result.p  pOn my page I have a codeDIVcode, whose height is fixed which Ive given the ID codetablecontainercode. As the ID suggests, it contains a table codeidmyTablecode, which has a row appended to the bottom every few seconds using JavaScript. The effect I am trying to achieve is that as the table grows in size, and beyond the size of the table container, the tablecontainer codeDIVcode will scroll down so that the last row is always visible.p  pIve used the following JavaScript to achieve thisp  pcodetablecontainer.scrollTop myTable trlast.position.topcode p  pThis works fine for the first 20 or so row additions, but after that it loses track of the bottom row completely.

To render the elements I use glDrawElementsp  pTwo colored triangles can perfectly overlap each with only one face colored. How do I go about implementing this How do I choose which side of a triangle shows the colorp  pFrom what I know the xml sid attribute identifies the side of the triangle to be colored based on the order of the vertices and it would appear the software producing the files chooses to use two separate triangles one for each colored side I have the normal and position vertices data being plotted successfully now I need to be able to apply colors to the elements.p

Negative 84213 pIm trying to make a program that will eventually show the runtime differences with large data inputs by using a binary search tree and a vector. But before I get to that, Im testing to see if the insertion and search functions are working properly. It seems to be fine but whenever I assign codeSIZEcode to be 30 million or more, after about 1020 seconds, it will only display codePress any key to continue...code with no output. However if I assign codeSIZEcode to equal to 20 million or less, it will output the search results as I programmed it. So what do you think is causing this problemp  pSome side notesp  pIm storing a unique, no duplicates randomly generated value into the tree as well as the vector. So at the end, the tree and the vector will both have the exact same values. When the program runs the search portion, if a value is found in the BST, then it should be found in the vector as well. So far this has worked with no problems when using 20 million values or less.p  pAlso, Im using coderandValue  rand  randcode to generate the random values because I know the maximum value of rand is 32767. So multiplying it by itself will guarantee a range of numbers from 0  1,073,741,824. I know the insertion and searching methods Im using are inefficient because Im making sure there are no duplicates but its not my concern right now. This is just for my own practice.p  pIm only posting up my main.cpp for the sake of simplicity.

Negative 84213 pI am working on Shared elements Transitions in Android and have executed the animations perfectly. The problem I am facing is when passing data using Intents. So, I basically start Intent from ActivityA, which is the first screen containing a recycler view, do an ImageTransform using TransitionName and start ActivityB, which contains a details activity containing a ViewPager. Now, when I press back button, ActivityB calls finishAfterTransition in which I create an Intent and set the result as followsp  precodeOverride public void finishAfterTransition      Intent datanew Intent     data.putExtraStudent, new Studentid, name, grade     data.putExtraCURRENTPOSITION, 2     data.putExtraLASTPOSITION, 5     setResultProfileConstant.ResponseCode.COMPLETEPROFILE, data     finishAfterTransition  true     super.finishAfterTransition  codepre  pStudent Model is the same as answered at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7181526howcanimakemycustomobjectsbeparcelablethis linka.  In ActivityA, I am using p  precode public void onActivityReenterint resultCode, Intent data          Student sr  Student bundle.getParcelableStudent         currentposition  bundle.getIntCURRENTPOSITION, 1         int lastposition  bundle.getIntLASTPOSITION, 1    codepre  pwhich throws the following exception.p  pAll the Animations works completely fine, when I dont pass the Student Object and everything works as intended, without throwing any exception. I am also using setEnterSharedElementCallback and setExitSharedElementCallback for mapping the views and their transition name, which has nothing to do with the Intent.p  pI dont understand why passing a parcelable object in Intent does not work with Transitions. Is there a workaround or am I doing it the wrong way Would appreciate suggestions.

Negative 84213 pA user is viewing another users profile at codeprofileuserBcode, and clicks the Add Friend button.p  pThis submits a codePOSTcode form containing both users to the codecreatecode view in the codefriendscode app codefriendscreatecode, which processes the data, creates a new codeFriendcode object and saves it in the database. A flash message is set as feedback, and the user finds themselves back on at codeprofileuserBcode.p  pThe user never sees codefriendcreatecode.p  pThis feels really obvious, and I did this regularly with CakePHP, but Im having trouble picturing this in Django. Im trying to keep a forms.py separate, with templates surrounding forms separate as well e.g. the Add Friend template may be included in various locations, including the form and submitting as above. I think thats the right way to do thisp  pThanksp
Negative 84213 pI divide a Page into smaller parts, but I share only one physical AppBar between them and exchange content of it depending on which part has a focus now.p  pFor instance, lets have a page divided into a 3 parts, and I want to automatically set a middle part when I swipe appbar in a middlep  pI hoped I could just automatically set focus on a proper part, depending on which part of AppBar I started swiping.p  pSo... Im having a problem finding a pointer position when showing AppBar. p  pI tried to attach PointerEnteredPointerMoved events on Window.Current.CoreWindow, so I could catch a moment you swipe up your finger onto a Window. It worked on Simulator, but doesnt work on an actual device cant catch any Pointer event when swipingp  pIs there any possible solution to that problem  p
Negative 84213 pI have some classes to interact with the different types of databases. Each dbclass needs to extend some general classes.p  pLikep  precodeltphp mysqlSelectSql extends commonSelectSqlAbstract mysqlSqlComposer extends commonSqlComposerAbstract gt codepre  pThe problem is that SelectSql should also extend the SqlComposerclasses. This is not possible in php  because it would need multipleinheritance.p  pSo i am trying a workaround and rewriting SqlComposer as a Trait. I also tried to use SelectSqlAbstract as trait Then the structure isp  precodeltphp class mysqlSelectSql extends commonSelectSqlAbstract   use mysqlSqlComposerTrait   abstract class commonSelectSqlAbstract extends commonSqlComposerAbstract   protected sqlType  select   abstract class commonSqlComposerAbstract   protected sqlType   protected dbType   trait mysqlSqlComposerTrait   protected dbType  mysql  gt codepre  pThis is really not best practice and it will give a fatal error .  But how else can i do this I dont want to get the properties by an function which extract it from the classnamesnamespace. p  pAnd Is there a better way to get this structure when you need 2 types of levels specificNSSpecificClass br extends commonNsSpecificClass br extends specificNsCommonClassbr extends commonNsCommonClassbrp  pComposition wont really help. Because most of the functions will be in de commonNs.

Currently, if there is a DataArray, it must contain X values.p  pMy question is  Suppose that you have a DataArray where every point has the same value i.e. 1. Is there a way to write the file such that the value is written once yet applied to every point I cant find anything in the documentation to suggest that this is possible. It seems to me that it is a waste of memory and computation to write out this value X times every time the file is written, especially if X is a very large number.p  pOr maybe the memorycost requirements are negligiblep
Negative 84213 pIm tring to make a character balance on one wheel of the bike in a 2d side scrolling perspective. I used two dynamic bodys one circle for the wheel and one multipoly from physicsbodyeditor for the character. I linked them with Revolut joint. Now my problem is, when balancing adding  torque to the character they also move left and right a lot. The problem is, when i add some horizontal velocity and I follow them with the camera, when you trie and balance the character, because of these movements, also the camera position changes , so all the sceen is jumping left and right.p  pIs there a way you can rotate a polygon presumably heavier then the circle around the circle, where the circle would stay still Or at least, how to track them with the camera and get constant speed.p  pThank you very muchp

Negative 84213 pI wanted to see if the Less Than operator codeltcode would work on strings. Well, it did. I started to experiment with it, and it turns out, I got the same result, regardless of the situtaion. The string on the left is always less than the string on the right, even if I swap the strings. Curious on why it did this, I tried to look up what the codeltcode operator actually does for strings. I read that it does a lexicographical comparison of the two strings. Still, this did not answer why my code was doing what it was doing. For examplep  precodeint main    if A lt B     stdcout ltlt Yes else     stdcout ltlt No  return 0   codepre  pIt would output codeYescode. That makes sense. But when I swap the stringsp  precodeint main    if B lt A     stdcout ltlt Yes else     stdcout ltlt No  return 0   codepre  pIt would still output codeYescode. I dont know if I am just being ignorant right now and not fully understanding what is happening here, or if there is something wrong. p

What Im pretty certain is happening is that flexbox first draws the objects without accounting for flex, then after things are loaded, the layout stretches.p  pAssuming Im correct in my assumption, I expected the solution to this would be finding a JavaScript or JQuery or Angular event to listen for when its done resizing, then inform the grid that it needs to redraw the columns. That being said, I havent found such an event, so maybe Im approaching the problem wrong, or maybe I just havent chosen the best search terms.p  pJust to help visualize the problem, heres an example HTML the grid is a bit weird. The style... is actually defined through css classes or Angular Material tags  see a hrefhttpsmaterial.angularjs.orglatestlayoutcontainer relnofollowherea.p  precodeltdiv styledisplay flex flexdirection columngt   lth1gtExample Fixed Width Taglth1gt   ltdiv styleposition relative flex 1gt     ltdiv aggriddefinition stylewidth 100 height 100 position absolutegt     lt This is where the grid is drawn. gt     lt The position absolute is done because the grid requires the div here have gt     lt a height and width property. gt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 84213 pIm a bit stumped here so Im hoping someone has some experience with this, the situation is like thisp  pI have an azure service with a cloud service mysite.cloudapp.net. In the service there is a VM myVM. In CPanel I have multiple subdomains that redirect to this service which will be named customer1.site.com, customer2.site.com etc. This would be with SSL wildcard certificate. Each of these subdomains has to link to a certain port in the VM.p  pI dont have a problem linking the subdomains to mysite.cloudapp.net with DNS in CPanel.p  pHowever Id like that if the url customer1.site.com was used that they get forwarded to port 8080appname. customer2.site.com would instead get forwarded to port 8081appname. And so on. All these ports have tomcat applications running on them.p  pI searched around online and it seems ARR would likely be the solution to my problem. Sadly I havent found a working setup which redirects to the correct ports. p  pIf anyone has experience with a similar situation I would love some input. Im not used to working with these systems and this setup is a bit more advanced than I expected going in.p

Negative 84213 pIm trying to create an app for iphone 5, 6 and 6 plus.p  pIve added a custom image for my navigation bar, but there is a problem. In images.xcassets there is two slots 2x and 3x.p  pI already know that 2x is for iphone 5 and 6 and 3x is for 6 plus. If I put an image for iphone 5 in 2x slot it would be too small when I emulate app on iphone 6 and if I put an image for phone 6 in that slot it would be too big when I emulet app on iphone 5. p  pSo how do I set up a navbar image for both iphone 5 and 6, if I one slot short Do I have to use a condition therep
