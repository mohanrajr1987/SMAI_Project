Positive 25482 pI am trying to achieve a multi page text editing layout, as in Pages, MS Word, ... . On OS X I can achieve this by creating one NSLayoutManager with one NSTextStorage for multiple NSTextViews. Each NSTextView has its own NSTextContainer. See below code for OS X.

Positive 25482 pCurrently, I know how to get the current keyboard height through notifications, and Im using that to set various auto layout constraints. When the keyboard hides, certain interface elements move down too, whilst remaining the same size. The size of this is dictated by a UITextView and the text typed in it, except once it gets too big, scrolling is enabled and its height is constrained to the current height so that it doesnt immediately collapse when scrolling is enabled. This works nicely when the keyboard disappears. The problem is when the screen rotates. Theres no longer room for the current fixed height, so the constraints become unsatisfiable. To properly update them and know what height the text view should be, I need to know what height the keyboard is in the orientation its about to rotate to since the space above it should be equal to this, is there anyway to do that without relying on hardcoded values which, even then probably wont work given custom keyboardsp  pI have considered alternatives to setting the height this way, but every solution I can think of ultimately requires the same keyboard information.p

Positive 25482 pI have a UITextView that takes up an entire scene view. The textviews length varies depending on how much content there is.

Positive 25482 pIm experiencing a weird issue with my Swift 2.0 app.p  pI have a editable codeUITextViewcode defined in my storyboard. If I leave the codetextcode property empty in the storyboard everything is working as expected. But when I enter the text codeKaasjecode in the storyboard and recompiling, the app freezes when loading the nib navigating through segue and the CPU jumps to 100 the app remains stuck. The app will never reach codeviewDidLoadcode at this point.p  pIt makes no difference when changing between fonts or fontsizes, behavior remains.p  pPausing in Xcode does not leave me with anything useful, the main thread is busy without specifying any function. Nothing is logged to output nor any logs are created.p  pIm running iOS9 on a iPad Air, the app has a built target of iOS8 and runs landscapeonly.p  pHas anyone ever experienced anything like this before, and might have an explanation for this behaviourp  pAs far as my assumptions Something goes wrong when calculating the textsize which results in a infinite loop while either calculating the size or adjusting the frame.p  pP.S. It happens with other texts too, but Kaasje always fails. It seems to fail when the the text is only 1 line. Longer texts tend to succeed aswel as leaving it empty.p

Funnily enough, when I scroll to the third of fourth screen, and then back to the first, the text has kept or rather regained its previous size. p  pI tried to use viewWillAppear and viewDidAppeard to change the font size, but you can witness the change of font size, which is ugly and unexpected. p  pI am running on iOS 9.0.1, but this bug has kept me busy starting in iOS 8.0, which was when I started developing the application. p  pHope someone can help me with this. p  pCheersp  p UPDATE  CODE FOR REVIEW  PageViewController p  precode     voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      self.pageController  [[UIPageViewController alloc] initWithTransitionStyleUIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScroll navigationOrientationUIPageViewControllerNavigationOrientationHorizontal optionsnil]      self.pageController.dataSource  self     [[self.pageController view] setFrame[[self view] bounds]]      childViewController  TutorialChildViewController [self viewControllerAtIndex1]     tvController  TutorialViewControllerTextViewController [self viewControllerAtIndex0]      NSArray viewControllers  [NSArray arrayWithObjecttvController]      UIPageControl pageControl  [UIPageControl appearance]     [self.pageController setViewControllersviewControllers directionUIPageViewControllerNavigationDirectionForward animatedYES completionnil]      [self addChildViewControllerself.pageController]     [[self view] addSubview[self.pageController view]]     [self.pageController didMoveToParentViewControllerself]        UIViewController pageViewControllerUIPageViewController pageViewController viewControllerBeforeViewControllerUIViewController viewController       NSInteger index  0      if [viewController isKindOfClass[TutorialChildViewController class]]          index  [TutorialChildViewController viewController indexNumber]           else if [viewController isKindOfClass[TutorialTextViewController class]]          index  [TutorialChildViewController viewController indexNumber]            if index  0                 return nil              index      return [self viewControllerAtIndexindex]        UIViewController pageViewControllerUIPageViewController pageViewController viewControllerAfterViewControllerUIViewController viewController       NSInteger index  0     if [viewController isKindOfClass[TutorialChildViewController class]]          index  [TutorialChildViewController viewController indexNumber]           else if [viewController isKindOfClass[TutorialTextViewController class]]              index  [TutorialTextViewController viewController indexNumber]               index      if index  6           return nil           return [self viewControllerAtIndexindex]             UIViewController viewControllerAtIndexNSUIntegerindex       TutorialImageViewController viewController  [[TutorialImageViewController alloc] initWithNibNameTutorialImageViewController bundlenil]     TutorialTextViewController tvC  [[TutorialTextViewController alloc] initWithNibNameTutorialTextViewController bundlenil]       switchindex           case 0         case 5              tvC.explanatoryText  [[UITextView alloc] init]             [tvC.explanatoryText setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica Neue size17.0]]              tvC.indexNumber  index             return tvC                      break           case 1         case 2         case 3         case 4                  viewController.preview  [[UIImageView alloc] init]                 viewController.explanatoryText  [[UITextView alloc] init]             [viewController.explanatoryText setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica Neue size17.0]]                  viewController.indexNumber  index                 return viewController                              break          default             break       codepre  p CODE  ViewController with the TextView p  precodevoidviewWillAppearBOOLanimated      [explanatoryText setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica Neue size17.0]]      [self.view addSubviewexplanatoryText]     switch indexNumber           case 0              [explanatoryText setText...text that resizes ....]              break                      case 5             [explanatoryText setText ... text that resizes...]              break         default             break        voidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated      NSLogviewDidAppear     [explanatoryText setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica Neue size17.0]]    voidviewDidDisappearBOOLanimated      [explanatoryText setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica Neue size17.0]]    voidviewWillDisappearBOOLanimated      [explanatoryText setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica Neue size17.0]]   codepre  pThe cases 14 use a different ChildViewController TutorialImageViewController, the troublesome textview is explanatoryText. p  pI also tried to use the life cycle methods of the ChildViewController to force the text to stay the same size.p  pHope this helps and clarifies thingsp

Positive 25482 pImagine an app like Wikipedia for the Apple TV, where it has a block of text that contains information about a given topic. Some words or phrases in the text could be other available topics you could read. Therefore you need to make those wordsphrases into focusable and clickable buttons.p  pOn a web page its really easy to do this with links, and its easy to style the links to look different from the noninteractive text. On tvOS, it would be easy to apply attributes to ranges in the text using codeNSAttributedStringcode where you can determine the start and end index of the phrases  thats not a problem.p  pMy question is, how would you go about actually creating the focusable buttons for text that is in the text view I was thinking about somehow determining the rect that surrounds each phrase, and adding invisible buttons on top of them, then when it becomes focused make it visible so the user knows its active. Im not convinced thats a good approach. Also allowing all buttons to be focusable as expected could be tricky.p  pLooking into this, others have recommended using a web view and showing that in the app because its easy to make the buttons links inside a paragraph tag for example. But codeUIWebViewcode isnt available for tvOS. p  pWhats a good solution to this problem It will need to allow the user to intuitively focus and navigate between the text buttons. In this specific case, we could assume the text view will not scroll, therefore a codeUILabelcode could be used instead of a codeUITextViewcode if necessary.p  pWikipedia on the web  need to map to Apple TV appp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com6DxVC.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6DxVC.png altWikipediaap

Negative 25482 pWe have been doing some research into physically isolating the secure and nonsecure sections of our web application into two applications.  All http requests would be served by one server or cluster and all https requests would be served by another server or cluster.p  pThe reason that we are looking into this is partially for the survivability of the application.  Since the secure section of the application is revenue generating we could, for example, have a larger andor more powerful cluster to serve the requests.  Conversely, when we upgrade the hardware in the secure application, it could be repurposed to serve the nonsecure site  basically extending the life of the servers.p  pHas anyone worked with this approach  We had an RFP out to a well known vendor last year for an architectural assessment and this was one of the possible paths that was recommended.  While I see the potential upside, I worry about things such as maintenance, deployment, version control, etc.p
Negative 25482 pI have a weird design situation that Ive never encountered before... If I were using ObjectiveC, I would solve it with categories, but I have to use C 2.0.p  pFirst, some background. I have two abstraction layers in this class library. The bottom layer implements a plugin architecture for components that scan content sorry, cant be more specific than that. Each plugin will do its scanning in some unique way, but also the plugins can vary by what type of content they accept. I didnt want to expose Generics through the plugin interface for various reasons not relevant to this discussion. So, I ended up with an IScanner interface and a derived interface for each content type.p  pThe top layer is a convenience wrapper that accepts a composite content format that contains various parts. Different scanners will need different parts of the composite, depending on what content type they are interested in. Therefore, I need to have logic specific to each IScannerderived interface that parses the composite content, looking for the relevant part that is required.p  pOne way to solve this is to simply add another method to IScanner and implement it in each plugin. However, the whole point of the twolayer design is so that the plugins themselves dont need to know about the composite format. The bruteforce way to solve this is by having typetests and downcasts in the upper layer, but these would need to be carefully maintained as support for new content types is added in the future. The Visitor pattern would also be awkward in this situation because there really is only one Visitor, but the number of different Visitable types will only increase with time i.e.  these are the opposite conditions for which Visitor is suitable. Plus, doubledispatch feels like overkill when really all I want is to hijack IScanners singledispatchp  pIf I were using ObjectiveC, I would just define a category on each IScannerderived interface and add the parseContent method there. The category would be defined in the upper layer, so the plugins wouldnt need to change, while simultaneously avoiding the need for type tests. Unfortunately C extension methods wouldnt work because they are basically static i.e.  tied to the compiletime type of the reference used at the call site, not hooked into dynamic dispatch like ObjC Categories. Not to mention, I have to use C 2.0, so extension methods are not even available to me. Pp  pSo is there a clean and simple way to solve this problem in C, akin to how it could be solved with ObjectiveC categoriesp  phr p  pEDIT Some pseudocode to help make the structure of the current design clearp  precodeinterface IScanner   Nothing to see here...   interface IContentTypeAScanner  IScanner      void ScanTypeATypeA content   interface IContentTypeBScanner  IScanner      void ScanTypeBTypeB content   class CompositeScanner      private readonly IScanner realScanner       Ctor omitted for brevity...

NOTE Composite is defined outside my code and completely outside my control.     public void ScanCompositeComposite c               Solution I would like imaginary syntax borrowed from ObjC          [realScanner parseAndScanContentFrom c]          where parseAndScanContentFrom is defined in a category for each          interface derived from IScanner.           Solution I am stuck with for now         if realScanner is IContentTypeAScanner                      realScanner as IContentTypeAScanner.ScanTypeAthis.parseTypeAc                  else if realScanner is IContentTypeBScanner                      realScanner as IContentTypeBScanner.ScanTypeBthis.parseTypeBc                  else                      throw new SomeKindOfException                     Private parsing methods omitted for brevity...  codepre  phr p  pEDIT To clarify, I have thought through this design a lot already. I have many reasons, most of which I cannot share, for why it is the way it is. I have not accepted any answers yet because although interesting, they dodge the original question.p  pThe fact is, in ObjC I could solve this problem simply and elegantly. The question is, can I use the same technique in C and if so, how I dont mind looking for alternatives, but to be fair that isnt the question I asked. p

Negative 25482 pI have a series of buttons that fire the list function when they are clicked. The list function itself contains an AJAX request and a bunch of other stuff before and after which loads in a separate section of the page.p  precodevar list  function   .buttons.addEventclick, list codepre  pEverything works fine if I wait for list to complete before clicking on another button. However, if I click on two buttons quickly, the page will start to return incorrect responses. In fact, it appears as though the responses get out of sync by 1. So if I quickly click on button A then button B, it will load response A. Then if I click much later on button C, it will load response B.p  pThere are two ways I can see to solve thisp  p1 Remove the click event from other buttons when any button is clicked and then restore it when list is complete. Unfortunately, I have tried placing code.buttons.removeEventscode at the top of the list function and then code.buttons.addEventclick, listcode at the bottom but this has no effect on the problem.p  p2 Chain the click events so that list is only ever executed when the preceding list has finished.p  pSo can anybody tell me how to get the second solution working Additionally, if anybody knows why the first solution doesnt work and why I get the weird delayed AJAX response behaviour, that would be greatp

Negative 25482 pI have a very complex function in as3. The function is composed of many other functions which are nested inside of it. The main function has variables and all its nested functions also have their own variables. Some of the nested functions are called by events that were added in the main function or in another nested function.p  pNow I want to know, when will my main function be garbage collected When will the code be out of the main function And when will the variables and the events and the nested functions be garbage collectedp  pP.S. To add some more detail. Imagine my main function is called loadImages and that it contains a bunch of nested functions connectToServer, sortImages and onImagesLoaded. When loadImages is first called, it will create a url variable and an images array variable. Then it will call its inner function called connectToServer. This function will connect to the server, start downloading the images and add an onComplete event listener that will call onImagesLoaded when all images have been loaded. Once all images are loaded, because of the event, onImagesLoaded is called. This function will remove the onComplete event listener and will call sortImages and pass it the loaded images as a parameter. After that, sortImages will sort the images alphabetically and put them in the images array of the main function loadImages. Finally, loadImages will addChild the images in the array to the stage.p  pThank You.p

Negative 25482 pI have a bunch of data that I need to export from a website to a PowerPoint presentation and have been using Open XML SDK 2.0 to perform this task.  I have a PowerPoint presentation that I am putting through Open XML SDK 2.0 Productivity Tool to generate the template code that I can use to recreate the export.  p  pOn one of those slides I have a table and the requirement is to add data to that table and break that table across multiple slides if the table exceeds the bottom of the slide. The approach I have taken is to determine the height of the table and if it exceeds the height of the slide, move that new content into the next slide.  I have read a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combrianjonesarchive20090813addingrepeatingdatatopowerpoint.aspx relnofollowBryan and Jonesa blog on adding repeating data to a PowerPoint slide, but my scenario is a little different.  They use the following codep  precodeA.Table tbl  current.Slide.DescendantsltA.Tablegt.First A.TableRow tr  new A.TableRow tr.Height  heightInEmu tr.AppendCreateDrawingCellimageRel  imageRelId tr.AppendCreateTextCellcategory tr.AppendCreateTextCellsubcategory tr.AppendCreateTextCellmodel tr.AppendCreateTextCellprice.ToString tbl.Appendtr imageRelId codepre  pThis wont work for me since they know what height to set the table row to since it will be the height of the image, but when adding in different amounts of text I do not know the height ahead of time so I just set codetr.Heightcodeto a default value. Here is my attempt at figuring at the table heightp  precode   A.Table tbl  tableSlide.Slide.DescendantsltA.Tablegt.First    A.TableRow tr  new A.TableRow    tr.Height  370840L    tr.AppendPowerPointUtilities.CreateTextCellThis    tr.AppendPowerPointUtilities.CreateTextCellis    tr.AppendPowerPointUtilities.CreateTextCella    tr.AppendPowerPointUtilities.CreateTextCelltest    tr.AppendPowerPointUtilities.CreateTextCellTest    tbl.Appendtr    tableSlide.Slide.Save     long tableHeight  PowerPointUtilities.TableHeighttbl codepre  pHere are the helper methodsp  precodepublic static A.TableCell CreateTextCellstring text      A.TableCell tableCell  new A.TableCell                             new A.TextBodynew A.BodyProperties,                             new A.Paragraphnew A.Runnew A.Texttext,                             new A.TableCellProperties     return tableCell   public static Int64Value TableHeightA.Table table      long height  0      foreach var row in table.DescendantsltA.TableRowgt                              .Whereh gt h.Height.HasValue              height  row.Height.Value           return height  codepre  pThis correctly adds the new table row to the existing table, but when I try and get the height of the table, it returns the original height and not the new height.  The new height meaning the default height I initially set and not the height after a large amount of text has been inserted.  It seems the height only gets readjusted when it is opened in PowerPoint.p  pI have also tried accessing the height of the largest table cell in the row, but cant seem to find the right property to perform that task.p  pMy question is how do you determine the height of a dynamically added table row since it doesnt seem to update the height of the row until it is opened in PowerPoint  Any other ways to determine when to split content to another slide while using Open XML SDK 2.0  Im open to any suggestion on a better approach someone might have taken since there isnt much documentation on this subject.p

And the Panel is located at 10,10  and is 100 by 500  I want something that will tell me that the visible area is 100, 290 assuming the 0,0 relative starting point for the panel which would be at 10,10 over all.p  pDoes such a method existp  pI have tried a few different methods like getting the parent handle of the panel im interested in and testing that but I cant always be sure the direct parent will be the one that determines the visibility.  p  pHere is the code of the test application I wrote to test codeGetWindowRectcode or the codeGetClientRectcodep  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.ComponentModel using System.Data using System.Drawing using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Windows.Forms using System.Runtime.InteropServices  namespace clientRectTest  public partial class Form1  Form      [StructLayoutLayoutKind.Sequential]     public struct RECT              public Int32 left         public Int32 top         public Int32 right         public Int32 bottom          public static RECT FromRectangleRectangle rectangle                      RECT win32rect  new RECT             win32rect.top  rectangle.Top             win32rect.bottom  rectangle.Bottom             win32rect.left  rectangle.Left             win32rect.right  rectangle.Right             return win32rect                    [DllImportuser32.dll]     [return MarshalAsUnmanagedType.Bool]     public static extern bool GetClientRectIntPtr hWnd, out RECT lpRect     [DllImportuser32.dll]     [return MarshalAsUnmanagedType.Bool]     public static extern bool GetWindowRectIntPtr hWnd, out RECT lpRect     [DllImportuser32.dll]     [return MarshalAsUnmanagedType.Bool]     public static extern bool SetWindowPosIntPtr hWnd, IntPtr hWndInsertAfter, int X, int Y, int cx, int cy, uint uFlags     [DllImportuser32.dll]     public static extern IntPtr GetWindowDCIntPtr hWnd       public Form1              InitializeComponent         this.AutoScrollMinSize  new Size250, 500             protected override void OnMouseClickMouseEventArgs e              NewLineClick Location   e.Location.ToString         base.OnMouseClicke           protected override void OnResizeEventArgs e              this.textBox1.Text  Panel Size  this.panel1.Size.ToString          NewLine Form Size  this.Size.ToString           NewLinePanel PARENT Client Rectangle   getPanelClientRectanglethis.panel1.Parent.Handle           NewLinePanel Client Rectangle   getPanelClientRectanglethis.panel1.Handle         NewLinePanel Window Rectangle   getPanelWindowRectanglethis.panel1.Handle         NewLinePanel Window Bounts   this.panel1.Bounds.ToString           NewLinePanel DC Client Rectangle   getPanelDCClientRectanglethis.panel1.Handle         NewLinePanel DC Window Rectangle   getPanelDCWindowRectanglethis.panel1.Handle          NewLinePanel Location   this.panel1.Location.ToString           base.OnResizee           private string getPanelDCClientRectangleIntPtr handle              string cr  string.Empty          RECT r1  new RECT         IntPtr dc  GetWindowDChandle         GetClientRectdc, out r1          cr  r1.left.ToString  ,   r1.top.ToString  ,   r1.right.ToString           ,   r1.bottom.ToString         Point thisLocation  this.Location          return cr           private string getPanelDCWindowRectangleIntPtr handle              string cr  string.Empty          RECT r1  new RECT         IntPtr dc  GetWindowDChandle         GetWindowRectdc, out r1          cr  r1.left.ToString  ,   r1.top.ToString  ,   r1.right.ToString           ,   r1.bottom.ToString         Point thisLocation  this.Location          return cr           private string getPanelWindowRectangleIntPtr handle              string cr  string.Empty          RECT r1  new RECT          GetWindowRecthandle, out r1          cr  r1.left.ToString  ,   r1.top.ToString  ,   r1.right.ToString           ,   r1.bottom.ToString         Point thisLocation  this.Location          return cr           private string getPanelClientRectangleIntPtr handle              string cr  string.Empty          RECT r1  new RECT          GetClientRecthandle, out r1          cr  r1.left.ToString  ,   r1.top.ToString  ,   r1.right.ToString           ,   r1.bottom.ToString         Point thisLocation  this.Location          return cr           private void NewLinestring p              this.textBox1.Text  Environment.NewLine  p        codepre  pEDIT more information found p  pI think the line codethis.AutoScrollMinSize  new Size250, 500code was messing up my results.

Negative 25482 pIm looking for a way to draw smooth animations in Python. I want to use cairo, partly because I like the subpixel filtering and partly because Im familiar with the API. My first approach was to use a GTK.DrawingArea as the target for a cairo surface. While the drawing was quick I couldnt find any reliable way to tie the display  buffering to the vertical sync so the animation was jerky and unreliable.p  pMy next approach was to try PyGame. Using the examples in the a hrefhttpwww.pygame.orgwikiCairoPygame relnofollowwikia as a starting point Ive written some simple code to animate various bouncing balls. The different approaches on the linked page fall into two categoriesp  ol liDraw to an offscreen cairo ImageSurface and then use Numpy to convert the pixel buffer to a Pygame surface.li liShare the same memory for both surfacesli ol  pThe first approach sucks for performance as the conversion takes about 10ms, which is most of the timeslice that I have for 60hz frames. Im running the code on a Macbookpro with 2.2Ghz Core2Duo and an Nvidia 8400. The time is very dependent on the size of the surface, this is for a 800x800 window.p  pThe second approach surfaces from the ordering of pixel coordinates. Both cairo and pygame insist that they can only use RGB pixel ordering and dont support conversion. The problem is that when I setup a pygame surface it uses BGRA pixel ordering, which completely shafts me. p  pSo now for the questionsp  ol liIs it possible to change the pixel format used by either library on the mac to be compatible with each otherli liIf it is not possible what is the     fastest way to do the conversion     purely in Pythonli liIf the fastest Python way still sucks up most of the time for a frame then how can I interface to some C code to do the conversionli liDepending on how complex the interface to C is, how much point is there in using pygame instead of just writing the SDL interface in Cli ol  p.p

Negative 25482 pFor sites with very large numbers of DOM elements, is there be any performance benefit to presenting some of the content within an iframe  For example, the application Im working on has a very large htmlbased tree which could contain tens of thousands of nodes at one time albeit not loaded all at once.  Putting aside the usability problems a tree this size presents, would there be any benefit to placing this content within an iframe, rather than within the main page  Do browsers handle memory differently for content embedded within iframes  Would this improve jquery selector performance by isolating this content  Im most interested in how this applied to IE 7, although I would be curious if it differs between browsers.p

Negative 25482 pIm writing a lot of code in javascript lately and Im using Prototype.js to help with a lot of the boilerplate, just the bind method is more than worth it since I like using closures instead of objects to do the heavy lifting. Its hard to give up habits picked up from using ruby blocks. So heres my question Is there any particular performance difference betweenp  precodevar func  somefunc.bindthis ... func codepre  pandp  precodevar that  this ... somefunc  we just rename this everywhere inside somefunc to that codepre  pThese tricks are required because inner functions default to the global context instead of the context of the outer function. In particular which version keeps things more flat. If there is recursion involved then the bind version will come to a crawl because bind will keep folding functions inside functions until unrolling things is impossible, at least I think thats what happens. Does the second version have the same problem.p

Negative 25482 pI have searched for this question, but it seems fiendishly hard to express a problem involving XSL in words, so Ive come up with nothing.p  pThe problem I have is thusp  pA company produces an application which uses XML files to store its documents. These files are enforced against schema version 1.1p  pHowever, the company decides to release a new version of the software which validates against a new schema with a different structure, schema 1.2p  pIn order for the customer to seamlessly use the new version, we want to programmatically convert their 1.1compliant files into 1.2compliance on file open. Ideally, we do this using an XSL Transformation. p  pOf the two schemas, some types are identical, some types have new or renamed members, and some are stored in a totally different structure. Therefore writing the transformation from one to the other is quite tedious, and maintaining it even more so.p  pIt would be nice to write a kind of transformgenerating transform which can match the unchanged types from the old schema to the new one, and emit placeholder elements codeltxslmessagegtcode elements, for example wherever it cant do so, in order to prompt the developer to write the custom logic by hand where its needed, with a guarantee that everywhere else is compliant.p  pSo the procedure goesp  ul liRun Transform A against Schema 1.2. This generates Transform Bli liRun Transform B against Schema 1.1. This matches Schema 1.2 to Schema 1.1 where possible, producing Transform Cli liTransform C is used as a skeleton by the developer to write a watertight transformation from stronginstance 1.1strong to stronginstance 1.2strong.li ul  pI have gotten a fair way through implementing this, but a few particulars of XSLT 1.0 are causing me problems.p  pTransform B requires automatic generation of codeltxslcalltemplategtcode statements with the typename of each element encountered pencilled into the codenamecode attribute. This will then correctly run the transformation logic for each strongtypestrong in order to generate Transform C. p  pHowever, codecalltemplatecode does not seem to accept any xpath syntax whatsoever. It insists that codenamecode must contain an NMTOKEN and an NMTOKEN only. I can understand this from a design point of view but its quite irritating, because I want to run logic on an element based on its type, not its name. Id like to state codecalltemplate nametypecode inside an codexsltemplate matchelementcode template. My stage 1 generation ensures that a matching named template will exist to call.p  pI am not sure how to proceed. Has anybody tried anything like this before Is there some fundamental theory of computer science which declares that it isnt possible in declarative syntax I hope notp  pI hope my explanation is clear. Ill post code if not.p

I understand that in that view, Ill instantiate the Facebook object and start the authorization in the button handler method, but what about handling the overriding of applicationhandleOpenURL  Id have to use a different FB object instantiated in my app delegate than the one used in my particular view controller.  p  ol lipDoes this situation call for a singleton  Or is it a good design solution to let my appDelegate instantiate the FB object, and access it through there wherever else I need it in my programp  pIn the FB docs, they tell you to override the applicationhandleOpenURL methodpli ol  pre classlangobjc prettyprintoverridecode BOOLapplicationUIApplication application handleOpenURLNSURL url      return [facebook handleOpenURLurl]   codepre  ol liAs written, doesnt this mean your application will only be able to open one type of url  If youre app needed to respond to more than just one, youd need to parse the url parameter to figure out which action to take, correctli ol  pThanksp
Negative 25482 pI am trying to write a proxy server in C language under Linux. It was working fine I had the perception that it was working fine until I tried it for streaming media.p  pLemme first tell the problem and then Ill jump onto streaming media. To read the incoming data from the website and forward it to the actual client I do thisp  precodecount  readwebsitefd,buffer,BUFSIZ  writeclientfd,buffer,count  codepre  pin a continuous while loop until I read up all the data on that socket.p  pNow the problem is if the actual website sends an HTTP packet with content length field as 1025 bytes and other part of data in other packets then still I always wait for BUFSIZ8192 bytes and then I send 8192 bytes to the client machine all together. for normal codeoctetstreamcode it works fine even though I know its not the right method, because I should forward the packets same as the actual server. So if actual server sends me 2 packet of sizes 1024 and 1024 bytes I send the client a packet of 2048 bytes with the first packet with the HTTP header saying that the content length is 900 bytes rest all being the http header assuming but actually I forward a packet of 2048 bytes to client. For Content Type applicationoctetstream it just downloads the whole thing and displays it either as image or html text or asks me to save it. p  pWhen the client request for a streaming media, because of the above reason the client is not able to play the video. So what should I do now  Thanks for reading my question. Please help me out. p

Negative 25482 pThis question has been in the back of my mind for years.  I am putting in a little historycontext.p  pWhen I programmed C back in the day, I had a firm grasp on memory leak you call new X and then you call delete X.  If you dont do the second part too many times, you could see the effect as an unbounded growth in the RAM your program consumed.p  pHowever, all was put back to zero when you killed the app and restarted.  For this reason, it was not maybe the best solution doable to fix a memory leak by forcing a restart.p  pI was vaguely aware, when I did some WinApi programming, that it was possible to screw up and start a handle leak.  The resource monitor shows you this, and I emthinkem it was the case that killing the program did not forgive you for your bad code.  I kind of assumed you would have to reboot.  But the reality was I adopted extra amounts of paranoia to avoid these leaks rather than try to actually understand their root cause.p  pWith .NET objects get automatically reference counted and a background thread sweeps up the memory consumed by allocations to orphaned objects.  But then there are still these things that hint at the possibility of screwing up like the term unmanaged resource.p  pI have thus far kept myself feeling safe by always following pattern that I see, for example, if I want to query SQL Ill google it first and find something likep  precodepublic DataTable GetDataSqlCommand cmd      DataTable dt  new DataTable    String strConnString      System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[conString].ConnectionString     SqlConnection con  new SqlConnectionstrConnString     cmd.Connection  con     SqlDataAdapter sda  new SqlDataAdapter     cmd.CommandType  CommandType.Text     try              con.Open         sda.SelectCommand  cmd         sda.Filldt          catch              return dt          finally              con.Close         cmd.Dispose         sda.Dispose          return dt  codepre  pMy problem is Ive never taken the time to wonder What if I didnt close the connection  I just employ the copypaste technique and move on.p  pThe advent of code snippet tools like LinqPad has got me thinking about this again because Ive often tempted to play around with APIs, like for instance I just ran the snippetp  precodestring qbConStr  DSNQuickBooks DataSERVERQODBCOptimizerDBFolderUserProfileQODBC Driver for QuickBooksOptimizerOptimizerAllowDirtyReadsNSyncFromOtherTablesYIAppReadOnlyY OdbcConnection connection  new OdbcConnectionqbConStr connection.Open connection.GetSchema codepre  pI didnt feel like using good form because, after all, its a snippett, rightp  pQuestion Rightp

Negative 25482 pAre there any language interpreters e.g. a JavaScript interpreter, Lua interpreter, Python interpreter, etc. that have the ability for the script to suspend itself, and for the host to resume it laterp  pIm writing a consoleRPG game engine in .NET, and Id like to be able to write a script for each nonplayer character on the screen. These highlevel scripts would call lowlevel script functions to do things like walk one square south, which would be implemented as a loop walk four pixels, then yield until the next animation frame walk four pixels, then yield etc. Yield would be some mechanism that lets the script tell the interpreter, Okay, Im done for now. Save my state, and my call stack, for later. When the timer fires for the next animation frame, the host would resume the script where it left off. There would be multiple scripts running independently, which probably means multiple instances of the scripting engine so that each one can have its own state.p  pOf course I could do this with any language, if I was willing to write a thread for each characters script, and resumesuspend every thread for every frame. But I dont want to create potentially dozens or hundreds of threads, which is why Im exploring the possibility of scripts instead.p  pIm not specifically attached to it being an interpreter, but I suspect that would be a requirement. Suspend capability, without threads, would pretty much require that function calls not be implemented using the CLR stack  they would need to use codeStackltTgtcode or some other sort of heap objects instead  which might well mean an interpreter built specifically for the purpose of suspendability.p  pIm aware of the upcoming codeawaitcode keyword in C, which would give me the concurrency Im looking for without threading, but its crazy complicated, and requires changing all the calling code to be codeasynccode. Its also a compiled language, and scripting is more appealing for game authoring. If possible, Id rather just provide a script library of walk functions and let the script author be blissfully unaware of the underlying complexity.p

Negative 25482 pIn Kettle, I use the following logic in a transformation, given some Strings X and Y as inputp  precode[User Defined Java Expression] Generate ID [Insert  Update] UpdateInsert table set id  generatedId, nameX, companyY where name  X dont update the ID column [Database Value Lookup]select id from table where name  X codepre  pIdea is to update existing entries in the table or create new ones and get the ID of the interesting row in the next step which may be an existing one or the newly generated one.p  pThis works fine when executed on MySQL  MyISAM but fails on MySQL  InnoDB, with all other parameters being identical. The last step fails when the row is just being inserted in the second step but works for rows already existing in the database.

Negative 25482 pMy python code is calling a C function in a native library also written by me. The function takes two strings as arguments and returns its response as a string. The two argument strings that python passes to C library are only read by the C library, so I am not worried about their memory management. AFAIK, their memory will be allocated by python and will be released when the python runtime seems it appropriate. p  pHowever, I understand that the memory of the string that C library returns has to be managed explicitly. One way I can implement it is the C function callocs a character array, populates it with answer and returns from the function. The python code uses the returned string and should call libcs free on that string or call another function of the same C library which will take care of freeing the memory. p  pIs there any other way to do this Does ctype offer any utility functions that simplify releasing the memory of data structures returned by native librariesp

Negative 25482 pAm I correct in assuming that a cascade can cancel the effect of inverse. For example, if I specify inversetrue in the parent mapping file on a child collection, this implies that the child is responsible to maintaining the relationship and any update operation on the parent should not result in an update on the foreign key in the child table. However, if I specify cascadesaveupdate in the parent mapping file on a same child collection, this cancels out the inverse setting and cascades an update operation on the parent to the child table which results in an update on the foreign key in the child table.p

Negative 25482 pI was wondering if anyone has a good, clean, safe way to manage github Organization repository access on their serversp  pIt seems that you can only attach pub keys to your personal account and cannot restrict access solely to an organization.p  pWeve got a beta server where we put multiple projects so deploy keys, because they need to be unique, arent ideal.

Negative 25482 pIve recently created an immutable class supporting operations like , , etc. that returns a new instance of that class when it is changed.p  pI wanted to make a subclass of that class to add a bit of state and functionality but now Im running into a problem in that all the original classs methods return instances of itself rather than the subclass.p  pBased on my current limited knowledge of Scala I can come up with thisp  precodeclass Fooval barInt     def copynewBarInt  new FoonewBar   def  otherFooThis  copythis.bar  other.bar   class SubclassbarbarInt extends Foobarbar     override def copynewBarInt  new SubclassnewBar   override def  otherSubclass  super.other.asInstanceOf[Subclass]  codepre  pThe problem here is quite obvious  all operations of the superclass that return a new instance of have to be redefined in the subclass with a cast.p  pAt first this.type seemed promising but this.type only includes this and not any other object of the same type.p  pIs there a standard pattern for making immutable classes easy to subclass Something likep  precodeclass Fooval barInt     def copynewBarIntSameType  new FoonewBar   def  otherFoo  copythis.bar  other.bar   class SubclassbarbarInt extends Foobarbar     override def copynewBarIntSameType  new SubclassnewBar   override def  otherSubclass  super.other.asInstanceOf[Subclass]  codepre  pThis particular approach would require the compiler to require that all subclasses implement a copy method that returns the same type as that subclass, which would be perfectly fine with me.  However, I dont think any such thing exists in Scala at this time.p  pSome workarounds that come to mind arep  ol liUse delegation  but of course Id still be reimplementing all the methods as delegate callsli liUse implicit types to add operations instead of subclassingli liUse a mutable data structure.  This is probably the simplest and quickest solution, but Id lose the benefits of using immutable data structures which Im still hoping to learn more about.li ol  pIm sure this has been discussed many times already and I apologize for asking again.

Negative 25482 pSo I come mostly from a web background and Im trying to learn the architecture of android apps.  Trying to grasp a proper understanding of content providers. p  pWhat I think Im understanding is that content providers are pretty much your middle man between the activityservices and your data DAO of sort.  I also think that content provider are also to provide other applications access to your data almost like a web servicep  pWhat Im not really getting is, what if you did not need this data exposed to other applications  Do I need to bother with content providers and all the uri defining etc  If not, is there a name for this ... pattern or lack of  Or am I better off just using ContentProviders and just accept the added benefit of exposing this data to other appsp  pI know eventually I will want to sync data between the app and a external database.  I saw a google IO presentation supporting the pattern of using a content provider for RESTful communication.  But for the time being, Im just trying to get comfortable with basic static data.  Then hopefully swap it out to data from a REST service down the line once I get it.p  pHope Im not completely off here.  Thanks.p

Negative 25482 pI am using the toolbox controls installer TCI to install controls from two different versions of the same .net assembly into two different tabs in the Visual Studio toolbox. The tabs are named ltproduct namegt ltversion numbergt. The assemblies contain the same number of controls having the same names. They are both properly installed into the GAC. p  pIn VS 2008 both tabs show up as expected, however, in VS 2010 only the tab of the newer assembly is visible. If I select Show All in the toolbox context menu, the tab and the controls from the older assembly also appear but are grayed out. After deleting the tab generated by the installation of the newer assembly manually, the other tab and its control icons immediately become visible.p  pNot using the TCI and adding the controls manually using Choose Items in the toolbox context menu results in the same behavior.p  pWhat am I doing wrong Is there a hidden toolbox related option which is set to different default values in VS 2008 and VS 2010 Is this perhaps a known issuep  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe problem seems to be caused by the two assemblies having the same file names. Apparently VS 2010 ignores the assembly version number. If I build the assemblies using different file names, both tabs and all controls show up in the toolbox. Unfortunately this doesnt solve my problem because renaming the assembly is not an option.p

Negative 25482 pIm trying to determine how much stack memory each method consumes when running. To do the task, Ive devised this simple program that will just force a codeStackOverflowErrorcode, p  precodepublic class Main      private static int i  0      public static void mainString[] args          try              m          catch StackOverflowError e              System.err.printlni                    private static void m          i         m       codepre  pprinting an integer telling me how many times codemcode was called. Ive manually set the JVMs stack sizecodeXsscode VM parameter to varying values 128k, 256k, 384k, obtaining the following valuesp  precode   stack    i       delta     128     1102     256     2723    1621     384     4367    1644 codepre  pdelta was calculated by me, and its the value between the last lines i and the current ones. As expected it is fixed. And there lies the problem. As I know the stack size memory increment was by 128k, that yields something like a 80byte memory use per call which seems exaggerated.p  pLooking up codemcode in BytecodeViewers, we get a stacks max depth of 2. We know this is a static method and that theres no codethiscode parameter passing, and that codemcode has no arguments. We must also take into consideration the return address pointer. So there should be something like 3  8  24 bytes used per method call Im assuming 8 bytes per variable, which of course may be totally off. Is it. Even if its a bit more than that, lets say 48bytes, were still far away from the 80bytes value.p  pI thought it could have something to do with memory alignment, but truth is that in that case wed have a value of roughly 64 or 128 bytes, Id say.p  pIm running a 64bit JVM under a 64bit Windows7 OS.p  pIve made several assumptions, some of which may be totally off. Being that the case, Im all ears.p  pBefore anyone starts asking why Im doing this  a hrefhttpblogdarisa.files.wordpress.com201106lulz1.jpg relnofollowI must be frank..ap

You can consider this flow of execution as a single process. There are too many processes like this and each file contains thousandth lines of codes. Thats why i cant change the whole code to be modularize which can be used by import statement.   So the question is how to make a single python file which will take care of executing all the other processes. If we are executing each process individually, everything works fine p

Negative 25482 pI am presently developing an EXTJS based portal making only asynchronous calls. The problem is that for only particular call in my portal, I have to access third party server which is like a black box to me with a reference ID. Third party server will process my request and generate results. I have to show these in my portal, and when user selects one of these results, selection has to be passed to both my server and the third party server. I want my portal to have minimum dependency on third party system. reference ID and data exchange is in JSON.p  pI cannot make any changes to the third party server. I am a starter so please excuse if my question is naive. If  you could direct me to some resources that would be fine too. I could have IFRAME but it spoils the consistency on my page. I also cannot lose the data entered by user prior to going to third party system. Thanksp

Negative 25482 pAs the old saying goes ... this will be my first attempt at posting a question to this forum. Please be kind with my feedback regarding my post. p  pI recently found out that later versions of Internet Explorer have a feature to Export to Excel. The end user simply executes a right mouse click on the page, selects Export to Excel, and automagically the web page is imported into MS Excel. I say I recently found out because I spend most of my time in nix environments and rarely have a need to use IE for anything other than accessing web pages at work.p  pAnyway, we recently configured one of our Apache Tomcat 7.x instances to use SSL to encrypt the transport layer. When the end user tried to use the Export to Excel feature in IE, the page could not be displayed in Excel. When SSL is disabled, the feature works.p  pI had a couple of ideas, based upon similar type situations happening in the past, but they were mostly code related i.e. created an Excel file to push to the browser. But, after searching for a few hours, I did not find any references to the Export to Excel feature in IE.p  pIm sure its something simple, but all I need is a point in the right direction. p  pstrongEdit  Server.xml configstrongp  precodeltConnector       port8443 protocolorg.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol       SSLEnabledtrue maxThreads150 schemehttps securetrue      clientAuthfalse sslProtocolTLS       keystoreFilecatalina.homeconfsslkeystore keystorePasschangeit gt codepre

Negative 25482 pIm looking at the weirdest thing and needs some help trying to identify whats going on. Ive got some JavaScript running on a Microsoft SharePoint server that makes an asynchronous image request.p  pWhen I load pages in my 32bit amp 64bit IE9 browser, the code runs as expected. When my colleague loads the exact same pages pulled from a predefined list in his 32bit and 64bit IE9 note, all the browsing modes are set to the same value the image request does not go out.p  pemHoweverem if my colleague opens the dev tools and closes them again not using it or submitting any commands then reloads the page the request is made correctly. If he then closes his browser and reopens it, it stops working until the dev tools are reopened.p  pThere is no ActiveX, flash, or anything else going on. Its 100 JavaScript, so Im at a total loss as to how to troubleshoot. Can anyone tell me whats going on or point me in the right directionp  pThings to notep  ol liHis system does have JS enabled  all the other JavaScript on the page runs fine for him, it appears to just be my JavaScript thats affected.li liWe both tested Chrome and Firefox, all of which had successful results.li liWe both tested in different browser modes of IE9, IE8, and IE7 through the IE9 executable.li liIf it matters, were both on Windows 7.li ol

Negative 25482 pI had severe problems getting my like button to work in IE9. It works great in Chrome and Firefox but in IE9 when I click Like or Send a new windows opens. I googled the problem and found a few similar posts but nothing that solved my problem. I just noticed that my site and my developer environment are both included in IE trusted sites and thus marked NOT to use Protected Mode. After turning ON Protected Mode it works. p  pSo I go to FB to see if I can report as a bug at a hrefhttpdevelopers.facebook.combugs relnofollowhttpdevelopers.facebook.combugsa but can find nowhere to actually post a bug  only browse. So besides of posting this to inform of my finding to other developers  can anyone point me in the right direction for posting a bug report. Tried to google it but noope.p

Negative 25482 pAre there any clean ways to implement a serverside FlexAIR app The basic idea is that a large Flex app would run off a server. A user would then see clientside only the current view of the Flex app and be able to interact with it. The interactions would be sent to the server, and it would process them accordingly. The overall goal of this is to not force the client to download a very large Flex app just to use the application.p

some code if possiblestrongp  precode    DECLARE StartDate Date  19900101 DECLARE EndDate Date  20121212 DECLARE CompanyID int  180  declare BPID [int] DECLARE AllClientBpId CURSOR STATIC  FOR SELECT

Negative 25482 pSorry about the bad title I have a WebView I am loading from a previously saved WebArchive.  The archiveweb page is html with some JavaScript for menus and some images nothing special or weird.p  pI am saving the page to a WebArchive, changing an image in the website same name, different content, reloading the original WebArchive yet the WebView is showing the current online state Better longer explanation below in case this makes no sense.p  pWhat seems to be happening is that the WebViewArchive is fetching the online version of the image and probably other resources in preference to the resources in the WebArchive.  If I take the online site offline and try again, the WebView displayed the resources from the WebArchive i.e. in their state when the archive was saved.p  pI have tried messing around with different caching settings in the WebView and NSURLRequest through the WebView delegate.p  pWhen I view the archive in Safari the behaviour is the same.  e.g. with online site available, open saved archive in Safari and online versions of resources are displayed.  Make online site unavailable and open archive again and the cached versions of resources are used i.e. the online ones just displayed  not the ones from the WebArchive.  Refresh the page showing the archive with the online site unavailable and the resources revert to those saved in the archive.p  pWeb page uses a lot of relative addressing e.g. image imagespic.png.  In the WebResourceLoadDelegate the resource URL is showing as e.g. imagespic.png and the mainDocumentURL as .p  pFor the application it is important that I usedisplay the resources that were saved with the archive rather than any more recent cachedonline version.  Any ideas how I might achieve this or what I might be doing wrong.p  pMore detailed explanation of what is happening in case above makes more sense Application is to save complete webpages fetched using WebView and saved as WebArchive.  Application fetches web page and saves it.  The online website changes the content of a resource e.g. imagespic.png has same name but contains different image data.  Application then loads the WebArchive from earlier and displays it in a WebView.  The page displays fine but e.g. imagespic.png is the online version rather than the one saved in the WebArchive.  Close application.  Make online website unavailable e.g. stop Apache server.  Rerun application, reload same WebArchive from earlier and the imagespic.png is that from the archive.  i.e. the WebView seems to be trying to fetch the online version of the resource rather than that stored in the WebAchive.

Negative 25482 pSome architectures have a prefetch write instruction to indicate to the CPU that youre going to be writing to a memory location before you actually do it. I understand that on a multicore machine this can be used by the core as a hint that it should try to get ownership of the given cache line now so that it can write to the location more quickly later. However, AFAICT that should only matter in situations when there are two cores potentially contending for the cache line. For a cache line thats only being read and written by a single core, does a prefetch write ever have any usep
Negative 25482 pIm attempting to use KnockoutJS and jQuery UI Sortable together.  I know this has been done before particularly, a hrefhttpsgithub.comrniemeyerknockoutsortable relnofollowknockoutsortablea, but my use case has some pretty specific behavior and Im hoping to avoid trying to make the switch.p  pAnyway, the problem is pretty straightforward  after moving a DOM element with jQuery UI Sortable, Knockout behaves strangely when removing the observableArray element bound to that DOM element.  It will fail to remove the moved element, and if the element that fell into the moved elements place is removed, it will remove both that and the originally moved element. Hard to put into words, but demonstrated by a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjoelhowardvgrTY3 relnofollowthis fiddlea.p  pThe problem seems actually take place in the following block in knockout2.1.0.jsp  precodefunction fixUpVirtualElementscontiguousNodeArray       Ensures that contiguousNodeArray really is an array of contiguous siblings, even if some of the interior      ones have changed since your array was first built e.g., because your array contains virtual elements, and      their virtual children changed when binding was applied to them.      This is needed so that we can reliably remove or update the nodes corresponding to a given array item      if contiguousNodeArray.length gt 2           Build up the actual new contiguous node set         var current  contiguousNodeArray[0], last  contiguousNodeArray[contiguousNodeArray.length  1], newContiguousSet  [current]         while current  last              current  current.nextSibling             if current  Wont happen, except if the developer has manually removed some DOM elements then were in an undefined scenario                 return             newContiguousSet.pushcurrent                    ... then mutate the input array to match this.          The following line replaces the contents of contiguousNodeArray with newContiguousSet         Array.prototype.splice.applycontiguousNodeArray, [0, contiguousNodeArray.length].concatnewContiguousSet       codepre  pThis call is adding the moved DOM element to the list of elements to be removed when the shifted element is removed.p  pSo an open call to any jQuery UI  Knockoutjs geniuses  is there a way to resolve this conflict, or do I need to do something entirely different to make these tools play nicely togetherp
Negative 25482 pI have some program handling some data either in a file or in some memory buffer.  I want to provide uniform way to handle these cases.p  pI can either 1 mmap the file so we can handle them uniformly as a memory buffer 2 create FILE using fopen and fmemopen so access them uniformly as FILE.p  pHowever, I cant use either ways above.  I need to handle them both as file descriptor, because one of the libraries I use only takes file descriptor, and it does mmap on the file descriptor.p  pSo my question is, given a memory buffer we can assume it is aligned to 4K, can we get a file descriptor that backed by this memory buffer  I saw in some other question popen is an answer but I dont think fd in popen can be mmaped.p
Negative 25482 pIm experiencing strange bug with my OpenCL kernel. Basically its bitonic sort upgraded to N  pow of 2. What I do is that I check back on host if the sequence is ordered correctly and what brought me here was the answer NOT.p  pNow the bug is very difficult to trace because it happens randomly. I sort many different sequences that I generate each time the same way and it just occurs that one sequence is not sorted, then the other.. However high percentage of outputs is correct and also my host implementation in for cycle sorts the same input correctly. Whats the funniest thing is that when I keep input and run it once more on device, it is suddenly sorted correctly.p  pI came up with idea that this might be race condition, because it acts just like that. However I dont have place for such thing in device code so only possibility is host. I have inorder queue and my reads and writes are blocking so there shouldnt be a problem with that, however I dont have synchronization points after executing kernels. p  pIs such synchronization needed What OpenCL guarantees for inorder queue Am I possibly reading before kernel finished all of its operations on the same memory piecep  pThe only other idea for this random occurrence is faulty memory in device, but thats last option I would accept, so Ill also welcome some other ideas of when one gets random resultsbugs with OpenCL.p

Negative 25482 pI have an application where I need to create a new table every three or so days.

So lets suppose on day one we created the first table with name date1p  pOn day three date3, on day six date6, on day nine date9 and on day twelve date12. In reality the numbers after the date string will be real dates, also I may create another table after two or one days not necessarily three.p  pNow suppose on day 13 I decide to run the statistics.

Negative 25482 pI know that test it in your app is a must. Nonetheless, I would like to ask for an analitical insight as well.p  pI have an inapp instruction queue as an codeArraycode which elements are processed sequentially. The details are irrelevant. Consider instruction as a virtual instruction, i.e. it is interpreted as such only in terms of my application  like a small internal Virtual Machine.p  pThe actual question is which is faster for processing the queue elements  virtual dispatch provided by Java, or a codeswitchcasecodep  ol lipIn the first case, the codeArraycode consists of descendants of an own codeOperationcode object or simply of codeRunnablecode  you get the point. In this case, instruction execution is merely calling the codeOperation.runcode override of the object. Virtual dispatch will do the rest  the coderuncode of the concrete instance will be called.pli lipThe codeArraycode is a primitive codeintcode array, and each element is an instruction code that comes from a contiguous range e.g. an codeintcode between 0..65535. Instruction processing means that the instruction code is interpreted A either via a codeswitchcasecode statement, or B by using an codeArraycode of codeOperationcode objects that is indexed directly by the instruction codes.pli ol  pIn the second case, I suppose codeswitchcasecode is optimized enough nowadays especially because Im using a contiguous range, so we can forget the codeArraycode option.p  pTo sum up, which is faster Adding the interpreting code to the branches of the codeswitchcasecode, or using the virtual dispatchp  pI suppose it breaks down to this is a codeswitchcasecode faster or a virtual dispatch I read that a codeswitchcasecode can be optimized to a branch table or jump instructions, and I guess in this case it will be possible.p

Negative 25482 pI am trying to set the property of a child view controller DateViewController from the parent and getting a bad access error the second time I do so.  Here is the code.

Now in the parent view controller ComdataIOSViewController.m I set the selectedDate property of the DateViewController to the variable receiptDate which is declared as an NSDate  in the interface section of ComdataIOSViewController.h.  This is a snippet of ComdataIOSViewController.mp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     receiptDate  [NSDate date]   IBActionbtnSetDate      dlgDate[[DateViewController alloc] initWithNibNamenil bundlenil]     dlgDate.selectedDate  receiptDate     dlgDate.myDelegate  self     [self presentModalViewControllerdlgDate animatedtrue]     [dlgDate release]   void dateViewControllerDismissedNSDate selectedDate      NSDateFormatter dateFormat  [[[NSDateFormatter alloc] init] autorelease]     [dateFormat setDateStyleNSDateFormatterShortStyle]     receiptDate  selectedDate     dateString  [dateFormat stringFromDatereceiptDate]     lblDate.text  dateString  codepre  pSo the first time I click the set date button on the parent controller, the DateViewController appears, I pick the date from the datepicker control, and the controller is dismissed.  In the parent view controller, dateViewControllerDismissed gets called and I set the receiptDate to the selectedDate parameter.  The next time I click the date button, I get a bad access error where I set the DateViewControllers selectedDate property to the receiptDate.

Negative 25482 pOkay, I have been trying to find a solution for this and I just dont seem to be able. I cant even break down the problem properly. This is the idea.p  pI have two sheets with many rows one with 800 and the other with 300,000. Each row contains a Name column and then several columns that contain information about this Name. Each sheet has different kinds of information. p  pI want to consolidate these two sheets into a master sheet based on this Name column they both have, so the consolidate function is perfect for this. Now the problem is that the names dont match perfectly.p  pFor example Sheet1 contains p  pCompany B.V., Info 1 br Company Total, Info 2 br Company Ltd, Info 3 brp  pand sheet 2 contains p  pCompany and Co., Info 4 br Company and Co, Info 5p  pSheet 1 contains all the names that are going to be used around a 100 but in different forms as stated above and sheet 2 contains all these 100 in multiple rows plus names that arent in the 100 list and therefore I dont care about. p  pHow would I make a VBA code project where the end result would be something like this, Master sheetp  pCompany, Info 1, Info 2, Info 3, Info 4, Info 5p  pfor every single Company the 100 list in there p  pI do hope there is a solution for this.

Negative 25482 pIm pretty new to CQt and Im trying to create an application with Visual Studio C and Qt 4.8.3.

The weird thing happens beyond this size. When I set codeimgwidth16000code and codeimgheight8000code, for example, the line codeimg  new QImage...code returns a null image. The image data should be around 512,000,000 bytes, so it shouldnt be too large, even on a 32 bit system. Also, my machine Win 7 64bit, 8 GB RAM should be capable of holding the data.p  pIve also tried this version p  precodeuchar imgbuf  uchar mallocimgwidthimgheight4 QImage img  new QImageimgbuf,imgwidth,imgheight,QImageFormatRGB32 codepre  pAt first, this works. The img pointer is valid and calling codeimgwidthcode for example returns the correct image width instead of 0, in case the image pointer is null. But as soon as I call codeimgsetPixelcode, the pointer becomes null and codeimgwidthcode returns 0.p  pSo what am I doing wrong Or is there a better way of modifying large images on pixel levelp  pRegards, Davidp

The callback is defined asp  precodecallback  arraythis, livefixtureprocessed codepre  pThen the callback is called in the worker by p  precodecalluserfunccallback, id codepre  pThis method changes the value in the array like thisp  precodethisgtliveresources[id]  1 codepre  pIt then calls another method that uses that array, and the change to the array looks to have been successful.p  pMeanwhile the class continues on its loop, and after a while it gets to using the thislive resources array, but the value has reverted to 0p  pI have also added a string variable p  precodeprivate called    codepre  pthat is also set in the callback, but in the subsequent loop has not been changed either. Is there an issue with the scope of a private variable used in a callbackp

Negative 25482 pstrongIntroductionstrongp  pI have inherited a legacy plugin project in C developed with VS2008, xlw 2.0 and excel 2003.p  pI have managed to port it to xlw 4.0 headers some method changed name when support for Excel 2007 was added, things like that. I am not generating anything yet, since the old code was written by hand and I am not going to change something which is working, and has a reasonable structure and code logic only for the sake of it.p  pThe code works as expected under excel 2003. I tried today with excel 2010 and found a most puzzling and scarying bug. p  pstrongPuzzling behaviourstrongp  pI receive from a VBA macro a column n rows, 1 column of numbers small positive integers by construction as a XlfOper amp and I want to convert it to an oldstyle array. The code is basically going through each row and then is calling the AsInt method on the XlfOper corresponding to the given row. Something likep  precodefor long iy  0 iy lt numcols iy  for long ix  0 ix lt numrows ix     convertXflOper xix, iy, a1D[iynumrows  ix]    codepre  pwhere a1D is the 1 dimensional array type used in this particular project, and convertXflOper is a template function, which is for these typesp  precodevoid convertXflOper const XlfOper ampx, long amp y      y  x.AsInt  codepre  pAt a given row, I have in the excel workbook the number 10.p  pstrongUnder Excel 2003, this is converted to 10.  Under Excel 2010 this is converted to 9.strongp  pI have debugged it, and the problem is that it is really reading not 10, but a double approximation to it. The output of the immediate window is p  precodex.lpxloper4gtval.num 9.9999999999999982  wrong I am not asking for 10.0, I am asking for 10 codepre  pin Excel 2010, and p  precodex.lpxloper4gtval.num 10.000000000000000  right an integer is an integer codepre  pin Excel 2003.

Negative 25482 pThis is maybe a bad approach problem more than a technical issue, but in any case your suggestions are very valuable.p  pMy website have two protected pages, stronghomestrong and strongpopupstrong, each of this pages requires a logged user. As you may know Symfony automatically redirects the non logged user to your loginpath in my case is just strongloginstrong, so thats ok. The problem is, the user who tries to log in from the URL stronghomestrong needs to see a template call strongnormallogin.html.phpstrong and the users who tries to loggin using strongpopupstrong will see strongpopuplogin.html.phpstrong. p  pMy strongloginstrong page is managed by my user controller, in there im just cheking for the header referer to see if the user comes from strongpopupstrongp  precode    previousUrl  thisgtgetRequestgtheadersgtgetreferer      ifstrpospreviousUrl, thisgtgenerateUrldonepunctispopup popupref  true codepre  pAfter the script finish, i just check the strongpopuprefstrong flag and if its true i just return the popup template, and if not i return the normal template.p  pSo far all very good and working tested. The Symfony framework then handle the form submission from any of the templates and login the user redirecting him to the original intended protected page either stronghomestrong or strongpopupstrong.p  pWhere is the fault you may ask Well since the system is based on a referer value, if the user do not make a mistake in the login form everything goes ok, but if the input information is not right bad password or username the checklogin script will redirect the user back to the login controller only problem this time the referer is NOT anymore stronghomestrong or strongpopupstrong but stronglogincheckstrong So now my controller does not know where the user came from so it does not know where template to return.p  hr  pWhat do you thinkp  pstrongEDIT requestedstrongp  h2Controllerh2  precodepublic function loginAction       popupref  false     previousUrl  thisgtgetRequestgtheadersgtgetreferer      ifstrpospreviousUrl, thisgtgenerateUrldonepunctispopup popupref  true       Se  gi loggato non deve vedere questa pagina quindi redirect     if thisgtgetsecurity.contextgtisGrantedROLEUSER ampamp popupref         return thisgtredirect thisgtgenerateUrldonepunctisuserhomepage       request  thisgtgetRequest     session  requestgtgetSession       verifica di eventuali errori     if requestgtattributesgthasSecurityContextAUTHENTICATIONERROR          error  requestgtattributesgtgetSecurityContextAUTHENTICATIONERROR      else          error  sessiongtgetSecurityContextAUTHENTICATIONERROR         sessiongtremoveSecurityContextAUTHENTICATIONERROR           ifpopupref          return thisgtrenderDonePunctisBundlePageslogin.html.php, array             lastusername gt sessiongtgetSecurityContextLASTUSERNAME,             error         gt error                   else          return thisgtrenderDonePunctisBundlePopuppopupSignup.html.php, array             lastusername gt sessiongtgetSecurityContextLASTUSERNAME,             error         gt error                    codepre  h2Securityh2  precodefirewalls     dev         pattern  profilerwdtcssimagesjs         security false     main         rememberme             key secret             lifetime 3600             path              domain          pattern          anonymous          formlogin             loginpath login             checkpath logincheck         logout             path   logout             target  codepre  pstrongIn the question I change some names just for having a more clear explanation, home actally does not exist, in reality everything called that needs authorization use the normal template, just the calls from popup need the popup template.strongp  pPS.

From what Ive gathered I could change the tick function to codecallcode and that would allow me to do what I wanted. A couple of the other answers said that this would make a new instance of the object, does that mean that it would use self.foos memory or would it make a whole new object, newly instanced or make a copy of self.foop  pAlso a couple of drawbacks to this which may or may not manifest themselves come to mind. For a particular part of my program, I check to see if the object has a codecallcode to determine if the argument Im passing is a function or a variable, and I dont really think I would want to allow that to be called even though, I suppose the class technically would be a function at that point. Is there any way to distinguish between a function and a callable classp  pIs there anything else that would make doing this undesirable and is it a pythonic way to work My next thought had been that given that other variable prefixed with codecode cant be used outside their class, but that doesnt seem to be the case here.p
Negative 25482 pIm using a special autocompletetextview for suggestions of thousands of streets. Due to this huge element list, I have to clear and populate the Adapter on the fly depending on the first input letter. For example, when the user enters b, the Adapter is being populated with all streets beginning with b. This works in all Android versions. Today one user told me that there are problems in Android 2.3.5, Samsung Galaxy Ace.p  pWhen he begins to enter letters, there is no dropdown with suggestions. When he enters b, it only suggest streets which consist of two names while the second name begins with b. For example the proposals he get for b is Am Bahnhof or Alte Bahnstrae. There seems to be a pattern, but I cant explain how this happens and I cant reproduce this, neither in any emulator nor on a real device moreover there is no 2.3.5 emulator.p  pBelow is the code. Just for information I have to clear in beforeTextChange, otherwise the application would crash when I delete the input in the field very quickly. Obviously it cant exchage the lists fast enough. And I need the variable alreadyAdded, otherwise it would add the list twice when I delete the input down to the first letter. p  pWhat is really strange Ive never changed this part since the first implementation and the user told me it worked at the first version. But suddendly it doesnt work anymore. Is it possible that the compiled code is somehow corrupt Any ideasp  pI would also accept a solution when somebody could tell me how to reproduce this.p  pInvocationp

Negative 25482 pIm curious about how NURBS are rendered in GPUs  the OpenGL graphics pipeline. I understand there are various calls within OpenGL and GLUT for easily rendering NURBS objects from a coding perspective using glMap and glMapGrid, but what I dont get is the process OpenGL goes through to do this.

Negative 25482 pI need to propose an algorithm for the following let us assume that we have an array consisting of zeros and ones. The array is filled with zeros from the beginning of the array to the index m, and all remaining indexes are filled with ones. I need to find this index m in Ologm time. Here is what i thought I think this is like binary search, first i look at the middle element of the array, if that is zero, then i forget about the left part of the array and do the same for the right part, and continue like this until i encounter a one. If the middle element is one, then i forget about the right part and do the same for left part of the array. Is this a correct Ologm solution Thanksp

Negative 25482 pI have just recently started working with Entity Framework within an ASP.NET project which I have also just recently started working with so Im a little overwhelmed latelyp  pI have a database that has 4 look up tables.

After doing some looking, I stumbled upon this  p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14771501entityframeworklookuptableEntity Framework lookup tableap  pand realized that look up tables with no other columns but the foreign keys become many to many relationships. That is all well and good. I might be missing something simple here, which Im afraid is probably the case, but now Im lost on how to query for the data that I originally had no problem traversing the look up tables to find.p  pHere is a generic model of my database Not the EDMp  pPerson PIDp  pGroup GIDp  pRequirement RIDp  pAction AIDp  pPersonGroup PID GIDp  pGroupRequirement GID RIDp  pRequirementAction RID AIDp  pPersonAction PID AIDp  pSo now with the many to many relationships between Person, Group, Requirement, and Action I am unsure how to construct statements within my ASP.Net web form project code to traverse through the relationships like I used to with the look up tables.p  pI used to be able to query PersonGroup where PID  desired persons id then use the GID to find all the RIDs from GroupRequirement. Then use the RID to find all the AIDs from RequirementAction. Then compare those AIDs to all AIDs in PersonAction where the AIDs matched to check if requirements were fulfilled.p  pI will not be insulted if you tell me this is something basic in ASP.NET that Ive overlooked, but I figured if I asked here and it was answered there would at least be a concise answer for anyone switching from SQL Queries to Entity Framework.p

Same applies for a hrefhttpmirageot.com relnofollowhttpmirageot.coma. I dont mind this, Id like to forward these requests to a hrefhttpsmirageot.com relnofollowhttpsmirageot.coma, if possible, but I can live with it if needs be.p  pThe bigger issue is that I set the SSL up and if I visit a hrefhttpswww.mirageot.com relnofollowhttpswww.mirageot.coma then the SSL doesnt appear to work, whereas if I visit a hrefhttpsmirageot.com relnofollowhttpsmirageot.coma it does. I understand that the SSL certificate only works for 1 subdomain or at least some only work for 1 subdomain, and I assume that Ive simply entered the URL without that subdomain, but surely I can at least forward connections which have www. or are not https to the correct domainp  pIf anybody could explain to me in simple terms how to go about this, that would be wonderful.

Negative 25482 pThis is a very basic doubt that I have. I am not an IT or CS guy so please try to explain in simple language. Now why I am asking that question is that because we can run 32 bit apps in 64 amp 32 bit OSs. AFAIK the data types for 64 bit take double amount of memory than 32 bit apps. Also 64 bit apps can only run on 64 bit OSs. Then why take the trouble of building 64 bit applications Perhaps thats why Firefox is available only in 32 bit Sorry if this question is not on par with the standards of SO, but I just cant control stop thinking about the same. Thank You.p  pUPDATE Somehow there seems to be a confusion. I did not mean to question why we need a 64 bit architecture machine. I know that 32 bit machines can only use 4GB RAM amp 64 bit machines have much higher limit. strongI was questioning why we need to build 64 bit Applicationsstrongp

The app starts, titles and other labels are loaded immediately and images starts loading lazily and finally gets finished. So far so good. The user scrolls to reach the bottom, reaching the bottom will use the scroll delegate method and the counter gets incremented from 1 to 2 telling the fetchEntriesNew method to reach the second page of the rss feed. The program will start loading the next 10 entries at the bottom of first 10 previously fetched. This can go on and the program will fetch 10 more entries every time the user scrolls and reaches bottom and the new rows will be placed below the previously fetched ones. So far so good.p  pNow let us say the user is on page 3 currently which has been loaded completely with the images. Since page 3 is loaded completely that means currently there are 30 entries in the tableview. The user now scrolls to the bottom, the counter gets incremented and the tableview begins populating the new rows from page 4 of the rss feed at the bottom of the first 30 entries. Titles get populated quickly thus building the rows and while the images are getting downloaded not downloaded completely yet, the user quickly moves to the bottom again, instead of loading the 5th page at the bottom of the 4th, it will destroy the 4th ones that is currently in the middle of getting downloaded and starts loading the 4th one again. p  pWhat it should do is that it should keep on titles etc from next pages when user reaches the bottom of the tableview regardless of whether the images of the previous pages are in the middle of getting downloaded or not.p  pThere is NO issue with the downloading and persisting data in my project and all the data is persisted between the application runs. p  pCan someone help to point me out to the right direction. Thanks in advance.p  pstrongUPDATE 3strong Based on Sergios answer, this is what i didp  p1 Added another call to archiveRootObject [NSKeyedArchiver archiveRootObjectchannelCopy toFilecachePath] after         [channelCopy addItemsFromChannelobj]p  pAt this point, its not destroying and reloading the same batch again and again, exactly what i wanted. However, it doesnt persist images if i scroll multiple times to reach the next page without the images of the previous page were loaded completely.p  p2 I am not sure how to use Bool as he explained in the answer. This is what i did Added property Bool myBool in TheFeedStore, synthesised it and set it to NO after newly added archiveRootObjectchannelCopy and set it to YES in ListViewController at the very start of fetchEntries method. It didnt work.p  p3 I also realised the way i am dealing with the whole issue is performance vice not better. Although i dont know how to use images outside the cache and handle them as sort of cache. Are you suggesting to use a separate archiving file for imagesp  pThanks a lot to all people who have contributed in trying to solve my issue.p

Negative 25482 pGiven a database that contains a table Foo. Foo has child relationships with several other tables, which in their turn have child relationships with even more tables. In short, Foo has child relationships to the nth degree.p  pNow lets say that we want to delete a record from Foo. Before we could do this, we would have to determine an optimal strategy to delete all child grandchild, etc... records to avoid tripping over foreign key constraints.p  pstrongIs there a tool that I can feed my database schema, tell it that I want to delete a Foo record, and it will calculate the optimal delete strategy for mestrong So I can take this strategy and implement it in my business logic.p  pemElaborationem As noted in the comments ON CASCADE DELETE would be a perfect fit for the above scenario. However, I neglected to say that Foo is connected to some of its descendants via multiple paths. This makes cascading not an option, for MS SQL Server at least. The ORM we use is LINQ to SQL, which also has no support for cascading scenarios. So we have a situation in which it is not so obvious in what order a record from Foo and all of its descendants should be deleted, and which order would be most optimal. This would require some puzzling, and Foo is not the only table for which this needs doing of course  Hence, my question if there is a tool that will analyze this for me.p

Negative 25482 pId like to know if there is a way to get the codeBaud Ratecode when its connected on the codeRS232 portcodebr codeBEFOREcode you initialize the codeSerialPortcode class and set its values. Let me try to explain the reason for that... p  pToday, Im working with two different codeRFID Readercode devices, each one works on a different codeBaudRatecode, so if I set a wrong codebaudratecode when I create the codeSerialPortcode class, it will read the card id all wrong, instead get the real cards id, it will get something like codeW2code.br Also, theres a possibilite that the device have a codeUSBcode port.p  pThats why Id like to know the devices codebaud ratecode before I instantiate the codeSerialPortcode class.p

Negative 25482 pI had a programming question come up today that I could not answer, and I was hoping someone here might be able to help me. Thank you all for helping in advance.p  pBasically, I want to take two vectors or arrays and represent them as polynomials, then I have to compute their products and output a new vector or array. For example,p  precodex1 lt c2,1 x2 lt c1,3 codepre  pWhich would be represented asp  precodex1  21x     And     x2  1  3x codepre  pMultiplying them together would yieldp  precode21x  1  3x  26x1x3x2  25x3x2 codepre  pSo, my functionwhatever it would be to do thiswould yield a vector with values 2,5,3. I would want to extend this to any length of each of the two vectors.p  pIve thought about this a lot but I have not been able to come up with anything close. Its beginning to eat at me. Im terribly embarrassed, but I really want to know how someone could solve this in R. Ive seen some similar posts for Java and Python, but the details still arent clear. p  pAll help is appreciated. Thank you.p

Negative 25482 pIm currently attempting to create a simple video chat service using WebRTC with Ajax for the signalling method.p  pAs per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17161287webrtcvideochatwithajaxinsteadofwebsocketpossibleanswertabvotestabtopthe recommendation of another Stack Overflow usera, in order to make sure I was understanding the flow of a standard WebRTC app properly, I first created a simple WebRTC video chat service in which I printed the created offer or answer and ICE candidates out to the screen, and manually copied and pasted that info into a text area in the other client window to process everything. Upon doing that, I was able to successfully get both videos to pop up.p  pAfter getting that to work properly, I decided to try and use Ajax as the signalling method. However, I cant seem to get it to work now.p  pIn my current implementation, every time offeranswer or ICE candidate info is created, I instantly create a new Ajax object, which is used to add that info after the JSON.stringify method has been executed on it to a DB table. Both clients are constantly polling that DB table, searching for new info from the other client.p  pIve been echoing a lot of information out to the console, and as far as I can tell, a valid offer is always sent from one client to another, but upon receiving that offer, successfully setting it as the remote description, and creating an answer, any attempts I make to set the local description of the answerer fails.p  pIs there any particular reason why this might happen Heres a snippet of my codep  precodevar i,   len  for i  0, len  responseData.length i lt len i  1     message  JSON.parseresponseData[i]    if message.type  offer       makeAnswermessage         Code omitted,    ...  makeAnswer  function offer     pc.setRemoteDescriptionnew RTCSessionDescriptionoffer, function        pc.createAnswerfunction desc          An answer is always properly generated here.        pc.setLocalDescriptiondesc, function             This success callback function is never executed.          setPayloadJSON.stringifypc.localDescription        , function             I always end up here.                     codepre  pIn essence, I loop through any data retrieved from the DB sometimes theres both an offer and lots of candidate info thats gathered all at once, and if the type property of a message is offer, I call the makeAnswer function, and from there, I set the remote description to the received offer, create an answer, and try to set the answer to the local description, but it always fails at that last step.p  pIf anyone can offer any advice as to why this might be happening, I would be very appreciative.br Thank you very much.p

Negative 25482 pIm really not sure if this is the solution to my problem, but its the only thing I can think of.  Im designing a simple platforming engine in LibGDX, but whenever you drag the game window or hold the left mouse button over the window pane for a certain period of time, when you let go the character will fall through the floor due to a build up of acceleration the longer you hold it the further hell teleport down after letting go. For some reason the act of dragging the window prevents the ground from stopping the acceleration buildup.  The only solution I can think of is to pause the game when the window is out of focus, but that might be completely wrong.p  pThanks.p  pEDIT I solved it by only updating the position if deltaTime is small enough, since deltaTime increases while the window is being dragged.p

Negative 25482 pThis is a followup to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17847814damagedpdffromitextinandroidherea, involving iText. I create a new Pdf with a different rotation angle, then delete the old one and rename the new one to the name of the old one.

I have also tried copying the file contents with a byte[] with the same results.

Negative 25482 pAs a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma3279550943619httpstackoverflow.coma3279550943619a ably describes, the right way to implement codeoperatorcode is usuallyp  precodemytypeamp operatormytype other      swapthis, other     return this  friend void swapmytypeamp lhs, mytypeamp rhs  ...

Negative 25482 pAs a learning exercise I used Symfony to update an existing application for a local nonprofit. Development was in a Windows environment.

Negative 25482 h2TLDRh2  pHow much memory does opening a file take up on a modern Windows system Some application loads will need to open a lot of files. Windows is very capable of opening a lot of files, but what is the load of keeping a single file open, so that one can decide when a lot is too muchp  h2Backgroundh2  pFor sequential processing of largeish datasets 100s MB  few GB inside a 32bit process, we need to come up with a buffer that stores its contents on disk instead of in memory.p  pWe have fleshed out a little class without too much problem using codeCreateFilecode with codeFILEATTRIBUTETEMPORARYcode and codeFILEFLAGDELETEONCLOSEcode.p  pThe problem is, the way these buffers will be used is such that each buffer each temporary file can potentially store from a few bytes up to a few GB of data, and we would like to keep the buffer class itself as minimal and as general as possible.p  pThe use case ranges from 100 buffers with  100MB each to 100.000s of buffers with just a few bytes each. And yes, it is important that each buffer in this sense has its own file.p  pIt would seem natural to include a buffer threshold in the buffer class that only starts creating and using a temporary ondisk file when it is actually storing more bytes than the memory overhead of creatingreferencing a temporary file uses  in process as well as load on physical machine memory.p  h2Questionh2  pHow much memory, in bytes, does opening a temporary file take up on a modern Windows systemp  ul liUsing codeCreateFilecode with codeFILEATTRIBUTETEMPORARYcode and codeFILEFLAGDELETEONCLOSEcodeli liBytes of the virtual address space of the 32 bit process opening the fileli liBytes of the physical memory on the machine including any kernel datastructuresli ul  pThat is, what is the threshold, in bytes, when you start seeing a net main memory gain both inprocess as well as physically from storing data in a file instead of inmemoryp  h2Notesh2  pThe comment mentioned a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary6e3b887c.aspx relnofollowopen file limita is not applicable to codeCreateFilecode, only to the MS CRT file API.

Since nobody else seemed it worthwhile to actually try, I did measured difference in codeMEMORYSTATUSEXullAvailVirtualcode over 100k calls, nothing else running. Dont ask me why it isnt 8 or 16 bytes, I wouldnt know. Took around 17 seconds of kernel time, process had 100,030 handles open upon exiting. Private working set goes up by 412k during run whereas global available VM goes down by 1M, so roughly 60 of the memory overhead is inside the kernel. ...p  pWhats more stunning is the huge amount of kernel time which is busy CPU time, not something like waiting on disk that codeCreateFilecode obviously consumes. 17 seconds for 100k calls boils down to around 450,000 cycles for opening one handle on this machine. Compared to that, the mere 10 bytes of virtual memory going away are kind of negligible.p

Also, I need to ensure that two websites are not trying to update the same row at the same time, or I can corrupt things, rightp  pWhat would be the best setup for this scenariop

Negative 25482 pFrom what i understand of Russian doll caching in Rails it would be detrimental to eager load related objects or object lists when we are doing RDC Russian Doll Caching because in RDC we just load the top level object from the database, and look up its cached rendered template and serve. If we were to eager load related object lists that will be useless if the cache is not stale.p  pIs my understanding correct If yes, how do we make sure that we eager load all the related objects on the very first call so as not to pay the cost of N1 queries during the very first load when the cache is not warm.p

Negative 25482 pI am using codeSDNcode from scala language and there is a bit of a problem because codeSDNcode for example, does not know how to handle codeOptionscode.

I am wondering if it is possible to register some custom components in codeSDNcode infrastructure using xml based configuration apart from simple codeConverterscode. p  pI know about converters but they only allow you to map one field to other, and even this wont work if I try mapping codeSetcode to codejava.util.Setcode.  p  pEDIT  My bad, I noticed that classes in this sample project are using some classes that are only accessible from codeSDNcode packages. When I created proper package structure meaning I did not change anything I can now save codeOptionscode for example.p  pBut still I am wondering if there is some cleaner way and also if it is possible to do something like this using xml configurationp  pEDIT If anyone is interested I forked the mentioned project and done some bugfixes. When I will have some time I will try to add support of codeRelatedTocode for codeScalacode collections currently you can only have codeScalacode collections for graph properties.p

Negative 25482 pI am trying to make this game in Flash  AS3 which goes on as long as the player doesnt lose. The longer the player goes for, the higher hisher score is. p  pI also need to save the high score, so I decided to save this using a text file. I open the file with mode UPDATE so that if the file doesnt exist it is created and I can readwrite. But obviously, when the file is first created it is empty so when I try to read the data in the file it returns error 2030. It then doesnt execute any of the code that involves the file stream. Also even if there is a number in the file, I cant read it because the program doesnt know how many digits the high score is going to be. This is the code that I am usingp  precodevar fileFile  File.documentsDirectory file  file.resolvePathhscore.txt var fileStreamFileStream  new FileStream fileStream.openAsyncfile, FileMode.UPDATE var bufferNumber  fileStream.readInt if buffer gt 0     if score gt buffer         buffer  score         fileStream.writeIntbuffer          else         highScore.text  Stringbuffer       else     fileStream.writeIntscore     highScore.text  Stringscore  fileStream.close codepre  pI have tried using readUTFwriteUTF and readUTFByteswriteUTFBytes instead of readIntwriteInt, but with readUTFwriteUTF it just gives me the same error and with readUTFByteswriteUTFBytes the program would need to know how many digits the high score is. If anyone knows how to get around a 2030 error or knows how to read a file without reaching the end or knows how to see how many digits there are in the file please let me know.p  pI could have added a line to the file telling the program how many digits there are but when the file is new the file stream would reach the end of the file while trying to read the number of digits. I am also open to other methods of storing the high score and reading it later. Thanks in advance for any help.p  pP.S. I am trying to do this with Adobe AIR for Androidp

Negative 25482 pMy team and I are new to TypeScript and NodeJS, and were having some serious troubles getting this project off the ground. Its meant to be a modularized game asset pipeline written in TypeScript for use with NodeJS I wasnt involved in the decision making here, and the discussion is still sortofongoing, but we still need a prototype.p  pWe have a good idea of the architecture already, but its kinda difficult to even get the prototype running, because I just cant seem to manage to wrap my head around how modules work in combination with interfaces and external dependencies. Some of our components also need to use NodeJS or other library modules e.g. NodeJS.fs for readingwriting files, and wed prefer to be able to use codereferencecode to add the appropriate d.ts files to keep type safety at development time.p  pAn example of the supposed project structure isp  precodepipeline     log          ILog.d.ts          StdOutLog.ts          FileLog.ts          ...     reader          IReader.d.ts          TextReader.ts          ...     parser          IParser.d.ts          XmlParser.ts          JsonParser.ts          ...     task          ITask.d.ts          JsTask.ts          CliTask.ts          ...     ... codepre  pThe way we want to use it is that we provide default implementations for our interfaces to cover the basics, e.g. running a console command, logging to a file or a stream, reading JSON and XML configs, ..., as well as the interfaces themselves so that other teams can create their own extensions e.g. codeclass GitTask extends CliTaskcode to encapsulate repository operations, or codeclass JpgReader implements IReadercode.p  pOn the calling side, in a different projectrunner app, it should work like thisp  precodeimport pipeline  requirepipeline  ...  var log  new pipeline.log.FileLog log.infofilelog started  var parser  new pipeline.parser.XmlParser parser.parsesomexmldata log.infoparsing XML   ... codepre  pIm very likely just doing it wrong tm, but I feel that its not easily possible to do with TypeScript what we want to do, especially considering that e.g. the definition for the log component can easily have several interfaces and also enums factory, logger, logitem, logtarget, loglevel. As far as I understand, NodeJS modules need to be a single JS file, but using even a single codeimportcode turns your module into an external module and those wont compile into a single file anymore, so that seems like a pretty steep roadblock to me.p  pIs there a way to realize that strucute and intended usage with TypeScript targeting NodeJS If yes, what would the files need to look like especially regarding the module hierarchy and component FQNs, e.g. pipeline.log.X, pipeline.task.Y, etc how would I properly use codemodulecode and codeexportcode for it If no, what are suitable alternatives to achieve our goalp  hr  pstrong[Update]strong Ive refactored my prototype according to basarats suggestion, and it already looks much better than before.

Negative 25482 pI have written a c program to count the codewordscode,codecharacterscode and codelinescode in a text file. The program is reading lines and words correctly but is not counting the total characters correctly. I am using GitBash on windows, so i used the codewccode command for checking my programs correctness.It always shows strongxstrong characters more than that my programs output,where strongxstrong is the no. of new line characters in my program.

Also from the strongfile sizestrong i came to know that codewccode is outputting the correct results.So what is the problem,is there any issue in the encoding in which my text file is stored.p  pstrongNOTEstrong Everytime i add a newline in my text file by pressing codeENTERcode, the size of the file is increased by strongtwostrong and so as the number of characters counted by the codewccode command but my programs output characters change by strongonestrong.p  pstrongEDITstrong According to the good answers i understood that there are extra codercode characters at the newline.So when codercode mode is used it interpret the newlines as codencode only while the binary mode coderbcode shows up actual coderncode.Here is the answer about this behavior a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2174889whatsthedifferencesbetweenrandrbinfopenwhat39s the differences between r and rb in fopenap

Negative 25482 pI was just looking at the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24219361subqueryusinglambdaexpressionSubQuery using Lambda Expressiona and wondered about compiler optimization of Linq predicates.p  pSuppose I had a codeListltstringgtcode called codenamescode, and I was looking for the items with the shortest string length. So we have the query icodenames.Wherex gt x.Length  names.Miny gt y.Lengthcodei from the question mentioned above. Simple enough.p  pNow, we know the C specification does not allow you to modify a collection while enumerating it. So I believe it is technically safe to assume the above call to codeMincode will always return the same value for every call. p  pBut, my hypothesis is the compiler truly has no way of knowing what the lambda inside the codeEnumerable.Mincode extension method returns. Since, for example we could dop  precodeint i  0 return names.Wherex gt x.Length  names.Miny gt i codepre  pWhich would mean the query in question is really Onsup2  the result of codeMincode will be calculated for each iteration. And to get the desired On implementation, you would have to be explicitp  precodeint minLength  names.Miny gt y.Length return names.Wherex gt x.Length  minLength codepre  pIs my hypothesis correct, or is there something special about Linq or the C specification that allows the compiler to look inside the lambda and optimize this call to codeMincodep  hr  pspender is absolutely correct. Consider the following snippetp  precodeListltstringgt names  new Listltstringgtnew[]  r, abcde, bcdef, cdefg, q  return names.Wherex gt       bool b  x.Length  names.Miny gt y.Length      names  new Listltstringgtnew[]  ab       return b   codepre  pThis will return only r, and emnot qem, because while the old reference to codenamescode is being iterated emforeach codexcodeem, the call to codeMincode after the first iteration is actually called with the emnew instanceem of codenamescode. But, a human looking at the query in the top of the question can say for certain nothing gets modified. So my question still stands is the compiler smart enough to see thisp

Negative 25482 pI have to NSArraysp  ul likundenArray  holding all customers currently about 3000li libestellungenMutArr  holding all orders currently about 8000li ul  pp  pEDIT2  addedp  pboth my arrays get filled by parsing separate csv files, so initially I have no clue about any relationship between customers and orders.p  pp  pFor every customer I try to determine its orders, more specifically its last order date.p  pI estimate that more than half of my customers do not have any orders, some have several, others a lot.p  pAt the very beginning I had 2 nested loops, the outer one iterating over all customers, the inner one iterating over all orders. Which ended up in more than 3000  8000 comparisons confer the attached code.p  pAfter some musing I realized that I have only valid orders, i.e. every order has a customer id and for every customer id i have an existing customer with the same id. To reduce the overhead of the inner loop I ordered both my arrays according to their customer ids.p  pThat implies that the first orders correspond to my first customers. E.gp  ul likundenArray[0] has customer with id strong115strongli libestellungenMutArr[03] has order with ids em2427em, each ordered by customer strong115strongli ul  pEach corresponding order is then collected in an array until I reach an order, whose customer id does not correspond to my customers id. I then exit break my loop, remove my collected orders from the array containing all the orders bestellungenMutArr and proceed with the next customer.p  pRemoval of the objects from the array is quite fast, as the objects are emALLem at the beginning of the big array. also see graphs stating the performance of the different array operations a hrefhttpridiculousfish.comblogpostsarray.html relnofollowherea at ridiculousfish.p  pInspecting the Instruments time profiler data, I found out that over 99 of the time is spent on the removal of the objects. Instruments output img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comV8bqz.png altInstruments output for my quotremoveObjectsInArrayquotapproachp  pI then came up with the idea to take advantage of the enumerateObjectsUsingBlocks index. Instead of using fast enumeration for the inner loop, Im using block enumerator. To achieve the same reduction of overhead in my inner loop i.e. never process an order twice I keep track of the index which I later use to have an offset for the next iteration for the next customer. This way I circumvent the removal of objects from an array, which I thought might quite a nifty idea.p  pInspecting the time profiler output it turned out it wasnt img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHLsYs.png altenter image description herep  pSo using the variant removing objects from array by using removeObjectsInArray method for about 1500 times is about 8 times faster, than simply keeping track of an indexp  pIs this to be expected or am I missing somethingp  pThe array removalfast enumeration variantp  precode void determineLastOrders      for Kunde  kunde in kundenArray              NSMutableArray bestellungenToRemove  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]           go through all remaining orders after the loop the matching will be removed and determine the next ones to remove          for Bestellung  bestellung in bestellungenMutArr                      if [[bestellung bestKdNr] isEqualToStringkunde.kdnr]                              if  kunde.lastOrder  nil                                         kunde.lastOrder  orangeDate  init                                  else if [kunde.lastOrder compare[bestellung bestDatum]]  NSOrderedAscending                                      kunde.lastOrder  [bestellung bestDatum]                                  As this Bestellung already has had a date comparison equal by kdnr                 we wont need to visit it again by our next customer                 [bestellungenToRemove addObjectbestellung]                          else                as all orders are ordered by the customer id we can abort iteration                 after we went past the current id                 break                               [bestellungenMutArr removeObjectsInArray bestellungenToRemove]       codepre  pand the checking index  block enumeration variantp  precode void determineLastOrders      block NSUInteger bestIndex  0     for Kunde  block kunde in kundenArray               go through all remaining orders after the loop the matching will be removed and determine the next ones to remove          [bestellungenMutArr enumerateObjectsUsingBlock Bestellung  bestellung, NSUInteger idx, BOOL stop                       if idx gt bestIndex                              if [[bestellung bestKdNr] isEqualToStringkunde.kdnr]                                      if  kunde.lastOrder  nil                                              kunde.lastOrder  orangeDate  init                                          else if [kunde.lastOrder compare[bestellung bestDatum]]  NSOrderedAscending                                              kunde.lastOrder  [bestellung bestDatum]                                                                       else                    as all orders are ordered by the customer id we can abort iteration                     after we went past the current id                     bestIndex  idx1                     stop  YES                                        ]       codepre  pThanks in advancep  pEDIT One other question just came to my mind. Currently  in my first code snippet, I always call the removeObjectsInArray method after each inner loop. If a customer has no orders, I remove an empty array i.e. trying to remove nil. My guess is, that the method exits is instruction to do removal if an empty array is passed, so this is more efficient than checking my small array for contents every loop. Or am I wrongp

Negative 25482 pIm really banging my head against the wall here. Is it so hard to get program output in Visual Studio Express 2013 When writing code, I find it absolutely essential to be able to print out the values of variables, operations etc. while working and troubleshooting. p  pIn Java and Eclipse, the System.out.println allways works, printing to the IDE console. When writing C programs I allways use the console, so echoing anything is no problem. However, in VS Express 2013 I cant seem to get any output.p  pCan the problem be related to the fact that Im writing unit tests, and not normal executable programs If so, is there some way to get VS to show program output in unit test classes Ive tried using debug, but that doesnt show anything either. Thinking that theres a config problem, Ive looked for solutions to debug messages not showing, but none of the options Ive found in here or other places seem to help.p  pOr, of course  if theres another commonly used method for checking program values, output etc. while writing code in VSC, Id like to hear about it p  pAnyone got any ideas And please, if the question is too unclear or something, tell me and Ill fix it.p  pNB Im using unit test classes for functional testing, in case someone wants to point out what I should and and shouldnt do with unit tests.p  pEDIT 1 I forgot to mention that Im not able to run the code with Start Debug. If I try, I get this error A project with an Output Type of Class Library cannot be started directly. The unit test project uses classes in another project, which i a class library project. This is, of course, because I have no executable project in the solution. The way I run it is to run the selected test, from the Test Explorer.p  pEDIT 2 Codep  precodeusing System using System.Diagnostics using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting using WordpressAutomation  namespace WordpressTests       [TestClass]     public class LoginTests  WordpressTest           [TestMethod]         public void AdminUserCanLogIn               System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLineSomething...

The SOMEWORDS part is known and does not change.p  pSo I begin by doing a positive lookbehind for code[SOMEWORDScode followed by a positive lookahead for the trailing code]code brThat gives us the pattern codelt[SOMEWORDS.]code br And captures the part code2001000codep  pNow because I dont know how many characters are after codeSOMEWORDScode, but I know that it ends with another codecode I use code.code to indicate any character any amount of time followed by codecode brThat gives us the pattern codelt[SOMEWORDS..]codep  pHowever at this point the pattern no longer matches anything and this is where I become confused. What am I doing wrong herep  pIf I assume that the first number will always be 3 characters long I can replace code.code with code...code to get the pattern codelt[SOMEWORDS....]code and this correctly captures just the code1000code part. However I dont understand why replacing code...code with code.code makes the pattern not capture anything.p  pEDIT It seems like the online tool I was using to test the regex pattern wasnt working correctly. The pattern codelt[SOMEWORDS..]code matches the code1000code with no issues when actually done in .netp

Negative 25482 pIve got an odd one here.p  pI have a package that copies some data from one SQL server database to another, into staging tables. That data is then transformed and copied into live tables. This is all done via an SSIS package run by a SQL job.p  pIt has been completely solid for months. This morning the job failed with the unhelpful DTSEPRIMEOUTPUTFAILED error in the SQL job, at the part where it copies the data into staging.p  pSo I ran it manually from BIDS and it worked without any errors. Odd, I thought. I then ran it manually from the server where it executes, but via the SSIS execution tool rather than the SQL job. No errors.p  pHowever, when I run it from the job, it fails. It always partially copies the data 1158 rows should be copied, so not a lot of data but fails after 813 rows. I have looked at the data in row 814 and it all looks fine.p  pI am logged into the server with the same account that the SQL job runs under  it uses a credential mapped to a domain account.p  pSo I temporarily put a restriction in to not import the row at 814, and now it works it imports 1157 rowsp  pThere are other tasks in the package that copy way more rows than this, and they are working fine.p  pSo Why does it work manually but not from the job What is it about row 814 thats odd I have copied the whole dataset into Excel, and there is nothing in that row that is odd, I am sure of it. And if there was something odd, why would it only affect the package when run from the job and not manuallyp  pFinally, I put the row 814 back in, and took out another row at random, and it worksp  pIf I force an additional row in, it also works.p  pSo it for some reason doesnt like the number of rows its importing to be 1158 but only when run via a SQL jobp  pI am completely stumped.p

Currently on my codemyRepopersistcode call I call the codeObjectManagerpersistcode and codeObjectManagerflushcode methods.br Tough by doing it like this I would always separately create and persist each entity, but for sure I want flush them all at once to prevent junk in my database if e.g. the last entity fails and the others only make sense when being related to each other. p  pNow I could say that I move the the codeObjectManagerflushcode into a separate method so that the codemyRepopersistcode actually only proxies to the codeObjectManagerpersistcode and then codeflushcode at the end of my service. But I dont feel so happy about this, because if I abstract the persistence away into my repositories, how would I know that the last flush actually flushes allp  pAnother way I was thinking about was to use my repositories as Doctrine repositories and only inject the ObjectManager into my service, tough this would lead to tight coupling to Doctrine then. But then I could at least suggest that if I flush the codeObjectManagercode that it flushes all of its repositories.   p  pActually the tight coupling wouldnt hurt in my applicaton, tough I am actually think that trying to completely abstract the persistence away is the cleaner solution. And why not try to reach the cleanest solution p  pSo whats a good approach to get around this issue Or am I just wrong and I should use Doctine services directlyp
Negative 25482 pI have a Build Configuration within TeamCity TeamCity Professional 8.1.5 build 30240 with two VCS Roots attached. The VCS roots point to seperate repositories.p  pThis Build Configuration has a VCS Trigger configured to trigger the project on each check in, with no quiet period specified. The issue is, this trigger does not seem to be working as builds remain in a Pending state.p  pA trigger rule has been added rootVCSIdProjectA so that a change made to ProjectB will not invoke the trigger. This trigger has been tested when only one VCS root was attached to the Build Configuration and it works as expected.p  pThe trigger has been tested by polling ProjectA repository and also by a POST hook from ProjectA. Both outcomes are the same. I have even tried sending multiple POST hooks from ProjectA repository to state that ProjectA and ProjectB had been changed, unsurprisingly, this despair test did not work either.p  pThe checkout rule for one of the VCS roots is .  .ProjectB. This is to ensure that ProjectB is not in the root directory of ProjectA, but a subdirectory. When manually starting a Pending build, both repositories are fetched from correctly.p  pBoth VCS Roots are configured for feature branches, however, removing the branch specification makes no difference to the outcome either.p  pHas anyone experienced a similar issue before and able to give some advicep

Negative 25482 pImagine a 2D game with a large play area, say 10000x10000 pixels. Now imagine there are thousands of objects spread across this area.

I tested the sheet and it was doing what I wanted until I removed the values I had used for testing when it crashed.

Negative 25482 pI am working on creating custom handlers for the python logging module. One of the handlers I am working on is logging directly to a database, which I have working, with one caveat...p  pIt works fine when I simply ask for record as a parameter, but I am hoping to pass multiple parameters, which I can then handle in the emit function and format appropriately. i.e.p  precodedef emitself, host, record     cTime  strftimeYmd HMS, gmtime     insert  self.hostLog.insert     insert.executeTimescTime,Hostnamehost,Messageself.formatrecord codepre  pHowever when I try to do this, it gives me an error saying emit is expecting 3 arguments, 2 were given. I ran a quick test using the exact same code but removing the host parameter and everything worked fine. This obviously means there is some issue with passing multiple parameters to the emit function. Is there any workaround for this I can provide more code if necessary, I thought this would suffice.p  pThanks in advance for the helpp

Negative 25482 pI downloaded a library called GMP its for doing calculations with arbitrarily large numbers and I cant figure out how to actually install and use it. All of the instructions I find tell me to run the files configure, MakeFile, and install, but when I try to do that I get install is not a recognized internal or external command. All I can figure is that the instructions are for Linux, but Im running Windows. I found a couple of instructions here on SO that tell me to copy certain files into the DevC folder, but I cant find the files specified.

Negative 25482 pI have a dictionary with many entries and a huge vector as values. These vectors can be 60.000 dimensions large and I have about 60.000 entries in the dictionary. To save time, I want to store this after computation. However, using a pickle led to a huge file. I have tried storing to JSON, but the file remains extremely large like 10.5 MB on a sample of 50 entries with less dimensions. I have also read about sparse matrices. As most entries will be 0, this is a possibility. Will this reduce the filesize Is there any other way to store this information Or am I just unluckyp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThank you all for the replies. I want to store this data as these are word counts. For example, when given sentences, I store the amount of times word 0 at location 0 in the array appears in the sentence. There are obviously more words in all sentences than appear in one sentence, hence the many zeros. Then, I want to use this array tot train at least three, maybe six classifiers. It seemed easier to create the arrays with word counts and then run the classifiers over night to train and test. I use sklearn for this. This format was chosen to be consistent with other feature vector formats, which is why I am approaching the problem this way. If this is not the way to go, in this case, please let me know. I am very much aware that I have much to learn in coding efficiently p  pI also started implementing sparse matrices. The file is even bigger now testing with a sample set of 300 sentences.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong Thank you all for the tips. John Mee was right by not needing to store the data. Both he and Mike McKerns told me to use sparse matrices, which sped up calculation significantly So thank you for your input. Now I have a new tool in my arsenalp

Negative 25482 pThis question is pretty simple and maybe even dumb, but I cant find an answer on google. Im trying to read a .txt file into R using this commandp  precodedata lt read.csvperm2test.txt, sept, headerFALSE, row.names1, col.namespasteV, seqlenmaxcount.fieldsperm2test.txt, sept, sep, fillTRUE codepre  pThe reason I have the col.names command is because every line in my .txt file has a different number of observations. Ive tested this on a much smaller file and it works. However, when I run it on my actual dataset which is only 48MB, Im not sure if it is working... The reason Im not sure is because I havent received an error message, yet it has been running for over 24 hours at this point just the read.csv command above. Is it possible that it has run out of memory and it just doesnt output a warningp  pIve looked around and I know people say there are functions out there to reduce the size and remove lines that arent needed, etc. but to be honest I dont think this file is THAT big, and unfortunately I do need every line in the file... its actually only 70 lines, but some lines contain as much as 100k entries, while others may only have say 100.

Negative 25482 pI have a very general question on how to implement VoIP for our current mobile amp Web App. we have an AndroidiOS App and a Web Application based on AngularJSNodeJS.p  pstrongWhat we want to achievestrongp  pIn the first step we want to achieve inter Application Voice and Video Calls. Later on we strongmightstrong expand into outbound calls into the normal telephone network. But this post is mainly for getting info on how to implement only our first step.p  pstronggeneral thoughtsstrongp  pWe had some experiences with Asterisk before which turned out to be far from easy. So for this project we wanted to get some feedback before actually implementing anything.p  pstrongthoughts on technologystrongp  pAt first I thought it might be a good idea to use strongWebRTCstrong, but since its only supported on Chrome, FF and Opera for the moment and pretty much is unsupported for native mobile Apps we think that WebRTC is probably out of the picture for now. or do you think otherwise After searching the web a bit more we found this a hrefhttpwww.webrtc.orgnativecode relnofollowhttpwww.webrtc.orgnativecodeap  pHas anyone experience with this libs It seems to us, that this could be the best solution for a modern voip solution and also would allow us to skip the asterisk serverp  pThe second idea would be to setup an strongAsteriskstrong Server for ourselves. Every time a user logs into the App we would connect him as a SIP Client to the asterisk. If one user calls the other one we think we should be able to make the call for example with the node package Asterisk Manager API a hrefhttpsgithub.compipobscureNodeJSAsteriskManager relnofollowhttpsgithub.compipobscureNodeJSAsteriskManagera. p  pThe third idea would be to use a strongSIP Providerstrong, but at the moment Im not sure if thats really the best idea.p  pSince were no VoIP experts, are there any other possibilities for VoIP integration into our appsp  pAny thoughts on that subject would be very appreciated Thank youp

This question is from a real dataflow.  The data is about a workflow steps.  It has a start time, and a complete time. Each step might have multiple rows because the step is called multiple times. When I choose a begin time and end time to get the dataflow, you can expect some steps is cut at the complete time instead of the start time which I want.p  pThe query is to remove the unpaired rows that begin with complete time.p  pAs you seen, every two rows should consist of a column of a and b, and start with a  the start time.  But those two rows to be deleted actually we do not know how many they are starts with b the complete time.p

So I think a pure batch solution is probably a better way to go...p

Negative 25482 pIve taken a fancy to including Jetty with my applications instead of deploying to a container.

Negative 25482 pIm trying to establish a system capable of broadcasting the screen capture of a pc to several other pcs on a LAN.p  pSo far I managed to install nginx on a Raspberry Pi with the rtmp module and I can stream using the Raspberry as a RTMP Server via OBS. I use VLC to watch the stream.p  pHere is the problem. The main pc doing the broadcast will be displaying a timer that counts down and potentially camera feeds so it would be ideal to keep the broadcast delay to a minimum real time. I currently have a 46 seconds delay between what is happening on the screen and the stream and am looking for ways to further reduce it.p  ul liIs there a way to determine how much of that delay time is due to encoding and how much of it is due to transferli liI am currently capturing at 1080p30 and tried options such as downscaling and minimize network impact to no avail.li liI read other topics concerning LAN broadcast on this forum and someone did mention that RTMP wasnt a good approach...If so what would be a better approachli liAny suggestions are welcome and appreciated. I am mostly interested in free solutions as I have no budget and doing this for free for someone else.li liI also did look into VLC streaming but I dont want to show the whole screen of the pc as there would be controls that the viewers dont have to see. And the only thing VLC can do about it is to specify which part of the screen to broadcast which doesnt seem like a great solution. I chose OBS because its the only free broadcasting software that can broadcast a specific window to my knowledge.li ul  pThanks in advance p

Negative 25482 pI have come across this design problem. I have an app that displays a list of mp3 the user can just play online or download to play locally. Now I want to add to the list view row layout a green tick in case the file has been downloaded. For this purpose, in the model class I have added a field called codeisDownloadedcode, which is initialized when a loader class loads from an xml file the mp3 list, then checks if they exist in the file system and sets the codeisDownloadedcodevalue accordingly. The data is downloaded once, when the app process starts, and it keeps it during config changes to not reload it. Now here it comes the problem I download the files with the system download manager which fires an intent when the file finishes downloading. To update the listview, I register a BroadcastReceiver during codeonStartcode and unregister it during codeonStopcode, so in case the download finishes while the user activity is in the foreground, the listview is updated. But what if the activity is in the background and the process has not been destroyed The downloading finished intent is lost and when the user gets back to the activity the UI wont be updated as the model has not been updated. It is obvious I need something else, so when the user is not interacting with the activity the model gets updated and when the user comes back the activity will repaint the listview during codeonStartcode. Registering a BroadcastReceiver in the manifest doesnt seem to be a solution, because if the process has been already killed when the downloading finish, it is not needed to start the process again and update the model which obviously wouldnt be even loaded. I would appreciate any design ideas or advices, thank you very much.p

However, Account Number 1234567890 is one cell. Ill need to split the strings up and extract just the 1234567890 part. The extracted part is then pasted into the table the new worksheet that is in the appropriate header. When it FindNext, it must paste the new value into an empty cell below it in the new worksheet. This process is repeated until the end. I dont know how best to approach this. Ditto for the other headers.p

Negative 25482 pI just wanted to know the main difference between a static constructor and a private constructor. p  pI know that Static Constructor is used to initialize the static members of a class. A static constructor cannot access nonstatic members. It executes before the first instance of a class. We can not determine the time of execution. Static Constructor executes by the CLR not by the object of a class. There are no parameterized static constructors since it is handled by the CLR not by the object. Time of execution might be at the loading of contained assembly. p  pHowever, Private Constructor is used to restrict a class to be instantiated and to be inherited. Private Constructor is used whenever a class contains only static members.p  pApart from this what is the difference between these two in terms of memory usage and other stuff Which should be usedp

Negative 25482 pIm currently working on a mobile app for a HomeKit compliant accessory. I am using the HMCatalog app and the HomeKit Accessory Simulator for testing purposes. p  pThe issue Im seeing involves my mobile app and the HMCatalog app. I was under the impression that HomeKit syncs through a users iCloud account. When I am signed in with my iCloud account on one phone Phone A, any HomesRoomsAccessories that I add on in the Catalog on Phone A will show up in my mobile app on Phone A.p  pHowever, when I use Phone B, and sign into the same iCloud account, I dont see the same data in Phone B that was in Phone A. The information appearing in HM Catalog appears it is staying on the individual device and not being stored in iCloud.p  pHas anyone else seen this Is this an issue with HomeKit With the Catalog appp

I would also be able to handle many2one and one2many relations.p  pFor many2many relations, I need a way to programatically find out which database table contains the relation details ids from both the models. I tried to get the data from the ORM fieldsget function using xmlrpc. The  field definition returns a dictionary which has a key named relation.

Negative 25482 pRecently I made a function that reads some mails when Outlook is getting closed. This function was created into a specific Module and the Function is being called when Outlook is getting closed. p  pSince the CloseQuit event cant be called in the Module itself as far as I know I created the event in ThisOutlookSession of the user. p  pIt looks like thisp  precodePublic Sub ApplicationQuit     ReadMails End Sub codepre  pThe ReadMails is the sub which handles the Reading of the mails obviously. So when a user exit his outlook this function gets executed and they get a message of it. p  pThis worked great at the initial user account where I implemented it. p  pThough, I also had to use this function and quit event on another User. So I copied the OTM Project to the other user first I changed the old OTM of that user to .prv.otm and then pasted it in there. The code seems to be copied perfectly as well as the code in ThisOutlookSession which gets copied to ThisOutlooKSession of the other user. p  pWhen testing it however the ThisOutlookSession code never gets executed at the second user account, it just doesnt launch the quit event on quitting outlook.. p  pHow is this possible since it did work at the first user account And how could I fix it p  pWhen debugging my application at the second user it seems to work fine no errors. To bad I cant debug the event itself  what happens when exit is being clicked.  p

When the item is selected it should bring back only one item into a grid view. That is this specific filter will at most bring back the record you are looking for.

As I kept selecting one filter value after another I noticed the page started to slow down. In fact by the 6th or 7th time it was pretty unusable. I dont know why its happening, but I suspect again it has to do with the fact that this linkbutton with the class name .apply is inside an update panel.p  pBut still I thought to myself, it was inside of an update panel before I changed my jQuery code to simulate the click event. So why does the page slow down and drag with this little piece of code Is calling the event from jQuery code rendering something else in the HTML that could be causing thisp  pIf I change my code back and force the user to click the apply button then we are back to a good normal speed. Why is it if I tell jQuery to simulate clicking the button my page slow down Its doing the same thing, the simulation of the click of this link button is calling its serverside code method whether the user clicks it or I have jQuery click it.p  pFor now Im at a loss as to why this is happening because this button is in an update panel in either case, yet when I have jQuery click it via code.apply[0].clickcode the page slows down after several attempts. Yet when I have the user simply click this button without the jQuery click event then it works finep  pWhat am I missing herep

Negative 25482 pI have a build service setup within TFS and I have a special AD user set as the user to run the service. When I enter the credentials for that user within the TFS Admin Console, everything works fine. For some reason, after so long not sure how long yet the Build Service stops running. When I look into the issue, it is because the password is blank. Any ideas why this would be getting cleared out If I put the password back in, everything will work fine until is clears out again.p
Negative 25482 pI am still working on finding points of intersection of hyperbolas using sympy. The hyperbola being generated are good I graphed them and they match the descriptions. The point 2, 0 is on all 3 hyperbolae, which I confirmed by substituting in the values. When I go to solve them I get inconsistent results sometimes solutions are found, sometimes some solutions are found, sometimes they arent. If I change the order of 2 equations passed in it can change the results. p  pI have found out a few things that made a difference. The units I use are important. If I measure distance in meters there are no solutions, if I use kilometers there are. there are small numbers, on the order of 10e6, in the equations for meters. I need to add the simplify method to the equations before solving or no solutions are found.p  pFollowing is the output of the program, and the code.

Negative 25482 pI am relatively new to android programming and I am having a few issues with how my database data is fetched. I am trying to create a simple messaging application. The data in the database is saving as expected but when it comes to displaying is where the issue is. The message activity displays all messages while the view message activity displays the activity thread. The issue is that the data displayed by he messages activity is ordered in a descending mode but the ID of each message loads ASCENDING and thereby messages do not get their actual conversation thread. I would like to know why the messages id are loaded in an ascending manner.

The problem is that one of the pieces of functionality in the system fails after uglifying but works fine prior to that.p
Negative 25482 pIm new to Access and this is the problem Im suffering I have four tables  Task, Person, Role, and TaskPerson mapping table.  I have a form that at the top has a unbound combo box displaying a list of people from Person.  In the body of the form I have a query pulling from the Task and TaskPerson tables that is embedded as a datasheet.  The fields from TaskPerson perform a lookup on Person and Role to display the actual values.  Each task can have multiple people assigned to it and each person can have multiple roles.  I am looking to pick a name from the combo box with the datasheet updating to only show the tasks associated with that person i.e. matching the name from the combo box to the name in the person field which is a lookup on the form and only showing those tasks.p  pI have tried adjusting the Record Source for the query so the person field criteria would pull from the combo box usingp  precodeForms[Task Form][Combo11] codepre  pbut that hasnt worked.  I have also tried a version of this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20847431usingcomboboxestofilterasplitformanswerap  precodePrivate Sub FormSelectionChange   If the combo box is cleared, clear the form filter.   If NzForm   Then   Me.Form.Filter     Me.FilterOn  False   If a combo box item is selected, filter for an exact match.  Use the ListIndex property to check if the value is an item in the list.   ElseIf Me.Combo11.ListIndex ltgt 1 Then   Me.Form.Filter  [Combo11]   amp               ReplaceMe.Combo11.Text, ,  amp    Me.FilterOn  True   End If  End Sub codepre  pWhile the code is not balking, it also isnt grabbing the selected name from the combo box, so it doesnt update.  A likely factor is when I type Me.Combo11.Text, it doesnt actually display Combo11 as an option.  I tried typing it in, in hopes of working, but I know that is a bit foolish.p  pAny emdetailedem answers would be appreciated.  Im still learning my way around and I get lost a bit easily.p  pSteve.p

Negative 25482 pI am trying to make a custom UIView in which a label on the view starts as a twoline preview of text, then grows to the size of the text when the view is pulled down to make room for the bigger label.

If I put it in the completion block, it doesnt crossfade animate at all. Im sure I am doing something dumb, here.

Negative 25482 pGday, I am relatively fresh to Azure so bare with me on this  as a disclaimer I warn that there may be malformed understandings going on here, hopefully not, but maybe.p  pstrongThe Situationstrongp  pThere is an existing Windows VB Timesheet Application that deploys on customers Windows devices not RT. This application creates a local SQL express store and synchronises with an Azure SQL DB via SQL data sync.p  pThe Azure SQL DB further sychronises with a master DB also via SQL data sync that is stored locally where I am contracted, the master data is typically only changed in this master DB and the transactional data is what is synced up to azure.p  pThe tables the application is working with are all under the dbo schema.p  pI am working on creating a Xamarin Forms mobile iOS, WP8, Droid, and maybe winRT, using a PCL version of the application wordy, but you get the idea that uses an Azure Mobile Service that points to the Azure SQL DB. It only uses a subset of the features as of now.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pNow the problem as it may be obvious already is that I need access to most of the tables, of which are under the dbo schema, and I was hoping  wondering what the best practice would be to solve this.p  pIf I could point my Azure Mobile Service to use the dbo schema and give the generated login the appropriate privileges manually  scripted. This is needed for my migration of the tables to include the required system properties an so fourth.p  pAnother proposition would be to add the system columns required for azure mobile services sync operations to the master db, push them up to the azure db and then create views of all the required data in the mobile services schema. I do not yet know if this would result in any limitations to the service.p  pThere is always of course the option of moving all the data to a schema other than dbo  however this requires extension work on the other systems, which may consume considerable time particularly due to my unfamiliarity with them.p  pAny relevant information, discussion or advice would be thoroughly appreciated.p  pCheers.p
