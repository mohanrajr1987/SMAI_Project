On the other side, there is just one store instruction codeST.E.128code, as expected.p  pI dont show the whole code here again, but I did a test where the stencil does not need a value to the left, but only one to the right e.g. codedata  data1code, in which case my codevaluescode array contains just 5 values and the codefloat4code load operation modifies the first 4 values of the array I still have one extra load for the last value. In that case the compiler uses codeLD.E.128code.p  pMy question is why doesnt the compiler understand that it can use the 128bit wide read if the target register is not the first one in the local array. After all the local array codevaluescode is just a programming way to say that I need 6 floats to be stored in the registers. There is no such a thing like an array in the resulting ptx or SASS code. I thought I gave the compiler enough hints for it to understand codeLD.E.128code was the right instruction here.p  pSecond question how can I make it use the 128wide load here without having to manually write lowlevel code However if a couple of asm instructions help Im open to receive suggestions.p  pSide note the decision of using 32bit load for reading the input and 128bit store for writing the input is taken while producing ptx code. ptx code already shows this pattern of multiple small loads and a single large store.p  pI am using CUDA 7.5 under linux.p  hr  pBased on the suggestions given in the comments, I did some experiments.p  pDeclaring either codeinputcode or codeoutputcode as coderestrictcode or both solves the problem the compiler generated a codeLD.E.128code and two codeLD.Ecode, which is what I wanted to achieve, when generating code for the architecture codesm35code. Strangely enough, when generating for codesm21code it still prduces six codeLD.Ecode, but it produces one codeST.E.128code. It sounds like a compiler bug to me, because the instruction codeLD.E.128code should be perfectly usable in the older architecture as it is in the newest.p  pThe code presented above uses the 128bit loads just with the small change of using the coderestrictcode keyword as suggested by njuffa and works. I did also follow the suggestion of m.s. I reproduced the same results shown in the pastebin snippet one codeLD.E.128code  one codeLD.E.64code. But at runtime it crashes with the following errorp  precodeterminate called after throwing an instance of thrustsystemsystemerror   what  an illegal memory access was encountered codepre  pIm pretty sure the misalignment is the cause of this problem.p  pUpdate after using cudamemcheck Im sure the problem is misalignmentp  precode Invalid global read of size 16      at 0x00000060 in kernelfloat const , float, int      by thread 4,0,0 in block 7,0,0      Address 0xb043638bc is misaligned codepre

Positive 2751 pTo be distinguished from shared memory in the CUDA terminologies. The CUDA documents declared that the compiler would do automatically perform registers spilling if the variable is large or the SM run out of resource. They declared this memory space as local memory, which is physically in the global memory but private to each thread.p  pI tested the performance in these three cases 1 leaving the variables in the private space, thus the compiler would automatically do the register spilling. 2 put the data in the global memory, index elements using threadID, without memory coalescing. 3 same as 2, but with memory coalescing.p  pThe result is that even 3 is slower than the case 1. p  pI dont know why this happen.p

Positive 2751 pI have two 2D arrays and I want the cosine distance between each set of vectors equivalent to the output of scipy.spatial.distance.cdist but I want to run it on my GPU.

Positive 2751 pIm trying to compile some coda using CUDA with MakeFiles generated by CMake.p  pId like to use CHECKCXXCOMPILERFLAG or something similar to check if the used nvcc version supports a given flag. In my case it is exptrelaxedconstexpr Cuda 7.5 and relaxedconstexpr Cuda 7p  pOf course I could compare the CUDA version but I find the compileflag check more failsafe.p  pIs there any CMake command similar to CHECKCXXCOMPILERFLAG that invokes the nvcc compiler and not the host compilerp
Positive 2751 pIm confused about understanding the differences between GPU memory peak throughput vs GPU bandwidth. Taking as example the GTX 470 with a memory bandwidth of 133.9 Gs. When I run cuda bandwidthtest I get a bandwidth of only 6267.8  MBs for  1 GB of data. So my question is how 133.9 GBS turned into only 6267.8 MBS p  pIs this about the latency occurrence p
Positive 2751 pSo Im trying to implement stochastic gradient descent in CUDA, and my idea is to parallelize it similar to the way that is described in the paper a hrefhttparxiv.orgpdf1012.1367.pdf relnofollowOptimal Distributed Online Prediction Using MiniBatchesap  pThat implementation is aimed at MapReduce distributed environments so Im not sure if its optimal when using GPUs. p  pIn short the idea is at each iteration, calculate the error gradients for each data point in a batch map, take their average by sumreducing the gradients, and finally perform the gradient step updating the weights according to the average gradient. The next iteration starts with the updated weights.p  pThe a hrefhttpdocs.nvidia.comcudathrust relnofollowthrusta library allows me to perform a reduction on a vector allowing me for example to sum all the elements in a vector.p  pMy question is How can I sumreduce an array of vectors in CUDAthrust The input would be an array of vectors and the output would be a vector that is the sum of all the vectors in the array or, ideally, their average.p

Positive 2751 pI am writing a function to search for the first occurrence that matches a specific criteria.  In my particular problem, I am interested in finding the array index corresponding to a circle that intersects with a given point.  I have three arrays that collectively describe the circles x coordinates, y coordinates, and radii codecxcode, codecycode, codeczcode.

Positive 2751 pSo heres the situation.p  pI have a block of threads running a while loop and I need the loop to continue if and only if some condition is met by any of these threads. To do that I use a shared variable as the continue flag, the flag is cleared by thread 0 at the beginning of each iteration, followed by a codesyncthreadscode, and can be set by any thread during the iteration if the continue condition is met. Then another call to codesyncthreadscode is placed before the checking point of next iteration to make sure threads are synchronized. The kernel is basically like thisp  precodeglobal void foovoid data      shared int blockContinueFlag     do          if threadIdx.x  threadIdx.y  threadIdx.z              blockContinueFlag  0                  syncthreads synch1         some data manipulations...         ifsome predicate              blockContinueFlag  true                  some data manipulations...         syncthreads synch2      while blockContinueFlag  codepre  pThe problem is the barrier synch2 doesnt seem to work in my code, sometimes the kernel terminates even when the continue condition is met by some threads I know this by checking returned data on host side. To further exam this I set a break point just after the dowhile loop like following code , where sometimes the codeblockContinueFlagcode is said codetruecode I can only assume the block exited the loop prior to some threads can set codeblockContinueFlagcode.p  precodeglobal void foovoid data      shared int blockContinueFlag     do          if threadIdx.x  threadIdx.y  threadIdx.z              blockContinueFlag  0                  syncthreads synch1         some data manipulations...         ifsome predicate              blockContinueFlag  true                  some data manipulations...         syncthreads synch2      while blockContinueFlag     a break point is set here  codepre  pI remember reading from cuda manual that codesyncthreadscode is allowed in conditional clause if the predicate is evaluated same for all threads, which should be in this case.p  pI have another simplified version of code just as an illustration for this.p  precodeglobal void fooint data, int kernelSize, int threshold      shared int blockContinueFlag     do          if threadIdx.x  0              blockContinueFlag  0                  syncthreads         if threadIdx.x lt kernelSize               data[threadIdx.x]             for int i  0 i lt threadIdx.x i             if data[threadIdx.x] gt threshold                 blockContinueFlag  true                  syncthreads      while blockContinueFlag   int main      int hostData[1024], deviceData     for int i  0 i lt 1024 i         hostData[i]  i     cudaMallocampdeviceData, 1024  sizeofint     cudaMemcpydeviceData, hostData, 1024  sizeofint, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice     foo ltlt lt1, 1024 gtgt gtdeviceData, 512, 0     cudaDeviceSynchronize     cudaMemcpyhostData, deviceData, 1024  sizeofint, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost     fprintfstderr, cudaGetErrorStringcudaGetLastError     return 0   codepre  pThe expected value for codehostData[]code would be code511, 510, 509, ..., 0, 512, 513, 514,..., 1023code at the end of codemaincode, which is sometimes the actual case.

But Kepler GPUs have 4 warp schedulers, so does this mean that only 4 warps can be worked on simultaneously within a GPU kernel And if so, does this mean I should really be looking for blocks that have multiples of 128 threads assuming no divergence in threads as opposed to the recommended 32 This is of course, ignoring any divergence or even cases where something like a global memory access can cause a warp to stall and have the scheduler switch to another.p  p2 If the above is correct, is the best possible outcome for a single SMX unit to work on 128 threads simultaneously And for something like a GTX Titan that has 14 SMX units, a total of 128x14  1792 threads I see numbers online that says otherwise. That a Titan can run 14x64 max warps per SMX x32threads per SMX  28,672 concurrently. How can that be is SMX units launch warps, and only have 4 warp schedulers They cannot launch all 2048 threads per SMX at once Maybe Im confused as to the definition of the maximum number of threads the GPU can launch concurrently, with what you are allowed to queuep  pI appreciate answers and clarification on this.p

Positive 2751 pI am working on parallelizing a C code using CUDA. What I have figured out is that we can do our computations in the following pattern  a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com06WQE.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com06WQE.png altcomputational patternap  pTherefore, we can compute only one element labelled 1 in first step, only after the first elements computation is done we can start computing the next two diagonal elements labelled 2, as we have data dependency. So on and so forth for other elements ... p  pThe approach that we have taken to solve this problem is to assign a thread to each row, where each one of them execute codesyncthreadscode at the end of each step to achieve the aforementioned synchronization.p  pBut, codesyncthreadscode takes a lot of time.

Positive 2751 pI am trying to implement a random forest in CUDA, each thread being an individual decision tree, which requires recursion. However, my computer does not support recursion in CUDA.. So I am trying to use data structures like queue to perform the recursion part.I googled but I cant find much information about that, and I tried using Thrust inside CUDA kernel but it wont compile.. So is there a way to use queue inside a CUDA kernel Thanks in advancep

Positive 2751 pstrongPROBLEMstrongp  pI have an FFTbased application that uses FFTW3. I am working on porting the application to a CUDAbased implementation using CUFFT. Compiling and running the FFT core of the application standalone within Nsight works fine. I have moved from there to integrating the device code into my application.p  pWhen I run using with the CUFFT core code integrated into my application, codecudaGetDeviceCountcode returns a codecudaErrorInsufficientDrivercode error, although I did not get it with the Nsight standalone run. This call is made at the beginning of the run when Im initializing the GPU.p  pstrongBACKGROUNDstrongp  pI am running on CentOS 6, using CUDA 7.0 on a GeForce GTX 750, and codeicpccode 12.1.5. I have also successfully tested a small example using a GT 610. Both cards work in Nsight and Ive also compiled and run commandline without problems, though not as extensively as from within Nsight.p  pTo integrate the CUFFT implementation of the FFT core into my application, I compiled and devicelinked with codenvcccode and then used codeicpccode the Intel C Compiler to compile the host code and to link the device and host code to create a .so. I finally completed that step without errors or warnings relying on a hrefhttpdevblogs.nvidia.comparallelforallseparatecompilationlinkingcudadevicecode relnofollowthis tutoriala.p  pThe reasoning as to why Im using a .so has a fair amount of history and additional background. Suffice it to say that making a .so is required for my application.p  pThe tutorial points out that compilation steps are different between generating the standalone executable as I do in Nsight and generating a devicelinked library for inclusion in a .so. To get through the compilation, I had to add codelcudartcode as described in the tutorial, as well as codelcudacode, to my codeicpccode linking call as well as the codeLcode to add code...cuda7.0lib64code and code...cuda7.0lib64stubscode as the paths to those libraries.p  pNOTE codenvcccode links in codelibcudartcode by default. Im assuming it does the same for codelibcudacode since Nsight doesnt include either of these libraries in any of the compile and linking steps.. As an aside, I do find it strange that although codenvcccode links them in by default, they dont show up from a call to codelddcode on the executable.p  pI also had to add codecompileroptions fPICcode to my codenvcccode commands to avoid errors described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19364969compilationfailswithrelocationrx866432againstrodatastr18cannotherea.p  pI have seen some chatter for one example, see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23464046hasanyoneactuallygottennvccandtheintelcompilertoworktogetherthis posta about IntelNVCC compatibilities, but it looks like they arise at compiletime with older versions of NVCC, so...I emthinkem Im ok on that account.p  pFinally, here are the compile commands for compilation of three .cu files all are identical except for the name of the .cu file and the name of the .o filep  precodenvcc ccbin g Iinc Ipathtocudasamplescommoninc m64 O3 gencode archcompute20,codesm20 gencode archcompute30,codesm30 gencode archcompute35,codesm35 gencode archcompute37,codesm37 gencode archcompute50,codesm50 gencode archcompute52,codesm52 gencode archcompute52,codecompute52 relocatabledevicecodetrue compile compileroptions fPIC o myobjectfile1.o c mysourcecodefile1.cu codepre  pAnd here are the flags I pass to the device linking stepp  precodenvcc ccbin g Iinc Ipathtocudasamplescommoninc m64 O3 gencode archcompute20,codesm20 gencode archcompute30,codesm30 gencode archcompute35,codesm35 gencode archcompute37,codesm37 gencode archcompute50,codesm50 gencode archcompute52,codesm52 gencode archcompute52,codecompute52 compileroptions fPIC devicelink myobjectfile1.o myobjectfile2.o myobjectfile3.o o mydevicelinkedobjectfile.o codepre  pI probably dont need the codegencodecode flags for 30, 37, and 52, at least currently, but they shouldnt cause any problems, and eventually, I will likely compile that way.p  pAnd here are my compiling flags minus the o flag, and all my I flags that I use for the .cc file that uses calls my CUDA libraryp  precodec fpic DLARGEFILESOURCE DFILEOFFSETBITS64 fnooperatornames DREENTRANT DPOSIXPTHREADSEMANTICS DM2KLITE DGCC stdgnu98 O2 fpmodel source gcc wd1881 vecreport0 codepre  pFinally, here are my linking flagsp  precodepthread shared codepre  pAny ideas on how to fix this problemp

Positive 2751 pI would like to ask you a question about the concurrent kernel execution in Nvidia GPUs. I explain us my situation. I have an code which launchs 1 sparse matrix multiplication for 2 different matrix one for each one. These matrix multiplications are performed with the cuSPARSE Library. I want both operations can be concurrently performed, so I use 2 streams to launch them. With Nvidia Visual profiler, Ive observed that both operations cuSPARSE kernels are completely overlaped. The time stamps for both kernels arep  ul liKernel 1 Start Time 206,205 ms  End Time 284,177 ms.li liKernel 2 Start Time 263,519 ms  End Time 278,916 ms.li ul  pIm using a Tesla K20c with 13 SMs which can execute up 16 blocks per SM. Both kernels have 100 occupancy and launch an enough amount of blocksp  ul liKernel 1 2277 blocks, 32 RegisterThread, 1,156 KB shared memory.li liKernel 2 46555 blocks, 32 RegisterThread, 1,266 KB shared memory.li ul  pWith this configuration, both kernels shouldnt show this behaviour, since both kernels launch an enough number of blocks to fill all SMs of the GPU. However, Nvidia Visual Profiler shows that these kernels are being overlaped. Why. Anyone could explain me why this behaviour can occurp  pMany thanks in advance.p
Positive 2751 pIve hit a complete brick wall in my attempt to use NVEnc to stream OpenGL frames as H264.

Positive 2751 pSuppose I have a kernel in which I first bring in the neighbors of a vertex from a CSR graph representation into the shared memory. I bring in 1024 neighbors at a time and loop until all the vertices are filled.

Presently I am doing a binary search in the shared memory to check if a threads Vertex is present.However this method suffers from a lot of thread divergence. Is there a better way to do this.p  pMy thread block size is 256.p
Negative 2751 pMy company is in the process of starting down the strongGrailsstrong path. The reason for that is that the current developers are heavy on strongJavastrong but felt the need for a strongMVCstyle languagestrong for some future web development projects.

Now that my company is jumping into Grails I bought the emAgile Web Development with Rails 3rd Ed  Betaem and Im starting to get into strongRoRstrong. Id still like to learn strongPythonstrong in the future or on the side, but my biggest question is p  ul liShould I be learning RoR, and have a more versatile language in my portfolio, knowing that my RoR knowledge will be useful for my Grails needs as wellli ul  pORp  ul liShould I just skip RoR and focus on learning Grails that Ill be needing for work soon, and work on learning RoRDjango RubyPython laterli ul  pBasically the question revolves around the usefulness of Grails in a noncorporate setting and the similarities between Rails and Grails. and this, while trying to avoid the centennial discussion of Python vs Ruby on Rails p

Negative 2751 pI have been banging my head on this one all day.  The C project I am currently working on has a requirement to display an editable value.  The currently selected digit displays the incremented value above and decremented value below for said digit.  It is useful to be able to reference the editable value as both a number and collection of digits.  What would be awesome is if there was some indexable form of a floating point number, but I have been unable to find such a solution.  I am throwing this question out there to see if there is something obvious I am missing or if I should just roll my own.p  phr p  pThanks for the advice  I was hoping for a solution that wouldnt convert from float  string  int, but I emthinkem that is the best way to get away from floating point quantization issues.  I ended up going with boostformat and just referencing the individual characters of the string.  I cant see that being a huge performance difference compared to using combinations of modf and fmod to attempt to get a digit out of a float It probably does just that behind the scenes, only more robustly than my implementation.  p

Negative 2751 pMy current pet project is a languageindependent database migration library a hrefhttpcode.google.compoctalfortywizardby relnofollowWizardbya on Google Code. Its pretty much inspired by ActiveRecord Migrations, but has a few niceties. For instance, does some basic type inference so you dont have to specify the type of a FK column. Its also smart enough to generate downgrade scripts given only upgrade sequence. Although migrations are written in a special DSL, this tool is primarily aimed at .NET projects.

Negative 2751 pI have a program in C, using the standard socket API, running on Ubuntu 7.04, that holds open a socket to a server. My system lives behind a router. I want to figure out how long it could take to get a socket error once my program starts sending AFTER the router is cut off from the net.p  pThat is, my program may go idle waiting for the user. The router is disconnected from the internet, and then my program tries to communicate over that socket.p  pObviously its not going to know quickly, because TCP is quite adept at keeping a socket alive under adverse network conditions. This causes TCP to retry a lot of times, a lot of ways, before it finally gives up. p  pI need to establish some kind of worst case time that I can give to the QA group and the customer, so that they can test that my code goes into a proper offline state.p  pfor reference, my program is part of a pay at pump system for gas stations, and the server is the system that authorizes payment transactions. Its entirely possible for the station to be cut off from the net for a variety of reasons, and the customer just wants to know what to expect.p  pEDIT I wasnt clear. Theres no human being waiting on this thing, this is just for a back office notation of system offline. When the auth doesnt come back in 30 seconds, the transaction is over and the people are going off to do other things.p  pEDIT Ive come to the conclusion that the question isnt really answerable in the general case. The number of factors involved in determining how long a TCP connection takes to error out due to a downstream failure is too dependent on the exact equipment and failure for there to be a simple answer.p

Negative 2751 pI have a Microsoft Word template with some code and some references, that has been working fine for months but has just started throwing up a spurious Userdefined type not defined error whenever I open it or try to compile it.p  pI know its a spurious error because I havent made any significant changes to the code. In fact, Ive rolled the code back to the last deployed version which I know works fine and I still get the error. Ive also commented out all the code in the template and I still get the error. Ive also removed and readded all references same error, and removed all the references and added them back, one by one, until the resultant compile errors are resolved, at which point Im left with the spurious Userdefined type not defined error. Im going to call this a UDTND error, from now, to avoid driving you all mad. I think the error started popping up after I rebooted my PC.

Ive been banging my head against my screen all afternoon, and thats helped about as much as all the other things Ive tried i.e. not at all. I have a feeling that this is something to do with a messedup reference, but afaict theyre all fine, and Ive removed and readded them, which I would expect to resolve that sort of problem.p  pAny ideas...p

I understand the outer loop is logV since youre joining sets. But then comes the internal loop.p  pIf you use equivalence relations to keep track of the sets, that means youre only getting the element representing the set, so you cant determine the edge with the smallest weight between the two sets because you dont have all the elements. If you modify the structure to hold references to the children you still have to get all the children of each set. That means, worse case scenario, OV2  OV for each set. p  pAfterwards, you still have to find the smallest edge connecting the two, which means going over all the edges connecting the two components. So you need to iterate over each node and see if its edge connects to an element in the other component, and if it does, if its smaller than the minimum edge you currently have.p  pMeaning, an outer loop to iterate over the nodes and an inner loop to iterate over that nodes edges  OVE. Since its inside an OlogV loop, you get OlogVVE.p  pNow, it seems as if you just have to iterate through all the edges, but how would you choose the minimum edge between the 2 components I can tell if a given edge connects nodes in different components, but I cant tell which one connecting them has minimum weight. And if I get the one with the minimum weight, it might not connect them.p

Negative 2751 pIm in the process of learning about simulated annealing algorithms and have a few questions on how I would modify an example algorithm to solve a 01 knapsack problem.p  pI found this great code on CPp  pa hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBrecipessimulatedAnnealingTSP.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comKBrecipessimulatedAnnealingTSP.aspxap  pIm pretty sure I understand how it all works now except the whole Bolzman condition, as far as Im concerned is black magic, though I understand about escaping local optimums and apparently this does exactly that.  Id like to redesign this to solve a 01 knapsackish problem.  Basically Im putting one of 5,000 objects in 10 sacks and need to optimize for the least unused space.  The actual score I assign to a solution is a bit more complex, but not related to the algorithm.p  pThis seems easy enough.  This means the Anneal function would be basically the same.  Id have to implement the GetNextArrangement function to fit my needs.  In the TSM problem, he just swaps two random nodes along the path ie, he makes a very small change each iteration.p  pFor my problem, on the first iteration, Id pick 10 random objects and look at the leftover space.  For the next iteration, would I just pick 10 new random objects  Or am I best only swapping out a few of the objects, like half of them or only even one of them  Or maybe the number of objects I swap out should be relative to the temperature  Any of these seem doable to me, Im just wondering if someone has some advice on the best approach though I can mess around with improvements once I have the code working.p  pThanksp  pMikep

Negative 2751 pIm working on a web based application that belongs to an automobil manufacturer, developed in SpringHibernate with MS SQL Server 2005 database. p  pThere are three kind of use casesp  p1 Through this application, end users can request for creating a Car, Bus, Truck etc through web based interfaces. When a user logs in, a HTML form gets displayed for capturing technical specification of vehicle, for ex, if someone wanted to request for Car, he can speify the Engine MakeModel, Tire, Chassis details etc and submit the form.  Im using Hibernate here for persistence, i.e. Ive a Car Entity that gets saved in DB for each such request.p  p2 This part of the application deals with generation of reports. These reports mainly dela with number of requests received in a day and the summary. Some of the reports calculate Turnaround time for individual Create vehicle requests. p  pIm using plain JDBC calls with Preparedstatement if report can be generated with SQLs, Callablestatement if report is complex enough and needs a DB procedureFunction to fetch all details and HibernateCallback to execute the SQLsProcedures and display information on screen.p  p3 Search This part of application allows ensd users to search for various requests data, i.e. how many vehicle have been requested in a Year etc.  Im using DB procedure with CallableStatement..Once again executing these procedures within HibernateCallback, populating and returning search result on GUI in a POJO.p  pIm using native SQL in  2 and 3 above, because for the reportingsearch purpose the report data structure to display on screen is not matching with any of my Entity. For ex Car entity has got more than 100 attributes in itself, but for reporting purpose I dont need more than 10 of them.. so i just though loading all 100 attributes does not make any sense, so why not use plain SQL and retrieve just the data needed for displaying on screen.p  pSimilarly for Search, I had to write proceduresFunctions because search algorithm is not straight forward and Hibernate has no way to write a stored procedure kind of thing.p  pThis is working fine for proto type, however I would like to know p  pa.

Negative 2751 pThis is my first time posting so please let me know if I fail to provide enough details. p  pI have a page that contains multiple accordions. I wanted to use multiple accordions because I wanted users to be able to have multiple sections open at once which is not native to accordion. p  pI also want users to be able to sort those accordions. The way the page is currently set up, users can sort the accordion with no problems. p  pWhen the user goes to sort the accordions, I have a script that will close all existing accordions, store their ids in an array, and then reopen them when the user is done sorting. That part works fine too.p  pThe problem occurs when you try to place the section you are sorting between two sections that were previously open. It does not appear that jQuery can easily tell where one section begins and one ends when they are closed programatically. Note that if they were already closed, it works as expected. p  pIve tried several approaches to this problem including adding a spacer div between sections as well as destroying the accordions and then reinitializing them after the sorting is finished to no avail. p  pI suspect the problem occurs because when the accordion is first grabbed, the sections are open.

Negative 2751 pHey guys, for the most part, IE9 renders my Wordpress based website just fine. By just fine I mean acceptable for now. The only problem is IE9 doesnt show the background or text for my homepage widget titles. For browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Safari etc. etc. I am using a red gradient background with white text and rounded corners which of course work fine. For IE9 I added a conditional statement to set the background of the widget title as a solid red color with no rounded corners. Unfortunately this did not solve the problem. The background still does not show up. The crazy thing is, when I open up the website in IE7 using Wine on my Mac, the widget title background shows up with the solid color...p  pAs a second measure of testing I set the background as a solid color with no rounded corners on the main stylesheet to see if it would work that in IE9. Of course, it did not. Even with the main css file changed the backgroundtext of the widget title still did not show up. I am really out of ideas as to what could be wrong and I was wondering if I could get some help.  p  pYou can find the website by going to bso.larryandpriscilla.comp  pOk, for the widget title here is the code.

Lets say contentid and contenttype. p  precodeSELECT  FROM TABLEA WHERE contenttypeabc codepre  pThe varchar contenttype has a length of 255. I am thinking about indexing it for faster SELECT queries. Will this improve performance And even though it has a length of 255, if only 5 chars are used and not the whole 255, would that make a difference on performancep

Negative 2751 pCan any one please help me in understanding custom scope. I went through manual and through many online example and understood how it is being implemented. But, I am still not clear why we need a custom proxy, and why we will go for, limiting the scope of the bean. p  pAs i know that for a singleton we use singleton when we want a single bean to be given to all references amp we use prototype when we want a new reference to be given each time the bean is referenced.  p  pNow my understanding regarding Custom scope isbr Custom Scope we use custom scope as a midway between the two that is neither we want to pass single reference nor a new reference every time.. strongbut then it is more close to singleton where we are passing the same bean every time, just from our preferred locationsuch as underlying threadlocal or map.strong  p  pplease do help me  making my concept clear ..The main question here is strongWhy custom scope strong and strongWhen is it requiredstrongp

Negative 2751 pI hope that this ends up being a simple question.p  pIm using JOGL in Netbeans to create a checkerboard of pixels where you can specify the number of tiles in each rowcol, and also the color of each of these tiles draw this tile with 0 alpha, draw that tile with full alpha. Speed is not an issue, nor is efficiency. p  pHeres my problem When I attempt to use glDrawPixels my glCanvas is sparsely filled rather then completely filled. As you can see Im currently trying to get a simple case of the drawing working before moving on to the more involved stuff. Im filling a 1D byte array with the value of a filled byte. Next I give this to glDrawPixels to write to the color buffer.p  pAm I handling the byte array incorrectly In practice as opposed to several tutorials Ive seen the method only takes a form of a Buffer for the actual data, so thats why Ive wrapped up the byte array.p  pAlso, the method seems to expect twice the data than the dimensions you specify to it. For instance you can see here that although Im telling it to manage an area of width by height, it throws an exception unless the byte array is actually double the width by double the height.p  pIm using glDrawPixels because Ive read that its the correct way to manage pixels.p  precode        byte[] src  new byte[width2height2]          forint a0 altheight2 a             forint b0 bltwidth2 b                 src[abb] 127                                gl.glDrawPixelswidth, height,                 GL.GLRED, GL.GLUNSIGNEDBYTE,                 ByteBuffer.wrapsrc codepre  pNote that width and height are the dimensions of my canvas256x256, so this operation should take up the entire canvass area.p  pId really appreciate any help you can give me. Im fine with solutions that involve completely different approaches as long as they still mean using JOGL. That being said Id rather not do this in a fragment shader. Thanks for your time.p
Negative 2751 pI have multiple tables 7 or more. There is a master table and all other are child tables FK to master table primary column id.

Negative 2751 pI have two entities having one to many relation and these are User and Address. One user can have many addresses. I am using one session and transaction per HTTP request pattern and Level 1 cache is turned on. For some reason I am seeing that my lazy loaded collections are not taking care of changes made to the data. For example If I create one user object. Then I create two address objects and save them like p  precodeUser u1  CreateNewUserolduserxyz.tld, olduserxyz.tld u1.Save  Address a1  CreateNewAddressu1, olduserxyz.tld, Old1, User1 a1.Save Address a2  CreateNewAddressu1, olduserxyz.tld, Old1, User1 a2.Save Session.Flush Assert.AreEqual2, u1.Addresses.Count  THIS IS FAILING BECAUSE COUNT IS 0 codepre  pNow when doing assert I am expecting user object to lazy load two address and count should be 2 but it returns 0. If I simply throw away complete cache by doing Session.Clear call that doesnt work either. But if I throw away complete cache by doing Session.Clear and then load my user object again this way it works as expected. I am not sure am I missing something or there is still something missing in NHibernate cache setup configurations. Any help will be appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 2751 pAlright, been banging my head against this problem for a little while and cant seem to get what I am looking for on Google or anywhere else.  I have built a CMS blog using PHP and MySQL.  It works great.  I have a table that holds the blog information title, author, date, and the post.  In my index.php I hit it like thisp  precode    sql  SELECT posts.ID as ID ,     posts.author as author ,     posts.title as title ,     posts.category as category,     posts.date as date,      LEFTposts.post, 312 as post     FROM posts     ORDER BY date DESC     LIMIT 3      result  mysqlquerysql     whilerowmysqlfetcharrayresult codepre  pThen I roll them onto the screen viap  precode    echo row[ID]     echo row[title], etc., etc. codepre  pI also have a table that holds some image information  just the size, filename, etc.p  pIn the posts table, the actual posts are written in a text field.  I would really like to put some place holders in the text for images  you know, to make the blog posts look better, some interspersed images that relate to the content.  I cant seem to get it to work right though. I tried to pull it off like thisp  precode    sql2  select  from images, posts where posts.ID  images.imagepost     result2  mysqlquerysql2 or die Could not access DB  . mysqlerror      while row2  mysqlfetchassocresult2          echo ltdiv classpicturegt     echo ltpgt      Note that we are building our src string using the filename from the database     echo ltimg srcimages . row2[imageurl] .  alt gtltbr gt     echo ltpgt     echo ltdivgt      codepre  pThen I echo the post.  So the pictures show up, but all of the pictures in the folder show in every post.  I think it is because it is a while loop within a while loop  I am fairly sure that might tear a hole in the universe.  p  pAll I want is the pictures to show where I mark them in the text of the post.p  pCan anyone help me understand how to match the marker I put in the text field of the posts table to the image in the images table  I keep looking online but everyone seems to use different ideas  strreplace, pregmatch, pregreplace and I cant seem to wrap my head around any of them.p  pSo, where am I going wrongp

Negative 2751 pIm trying to get a hrefhttplucene.apache.orgjavadocsindex.html relnofollowLucenea working in an unsigned applet. The motivation is that we only have access to a users plaintext data on the clientside and are trying to build a search and indexing facility for apps without a trusted server. The idea is that documents will be pushed into the lucene applet using javascript, indexed and then exported as an opaque blob that can be encrypted clientside and then pushed to an untrusted server for storage. For search, the index will be downloaded, decrypted and loaded into the applet. Were generally expecting very small indices.p  pSo, the problem It seems I cant instantiate an emIndexWriterem without mysterious, bad things happening. From the javascript side Chrome I get an Error calling method on NPObject. From the Java console I get nothing no apparent exception, no stack trace, nothing.p  pBefore instantiating the emIndexWriterem Im successfully instantiating a emRAMDirectoryem, emIndexWriterConfigem and emStandardAnalyzerem, no problems there. My assumption is that something in the stack trace above emnew IndexWriter...em is violating an applet security policy. I found some old Lucene a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseLUCENE369 relnofollowbugsa reporting problems with System.getProperty but they seem to have been patched ages ago. Im building the most recent code as of August 8, 2011.p  pDoes anyone know how I could get more detailed information from the JRE on whats causing the problem or, ever better, does anyone know which Lucene classes if any need to be patched for unsigned execution Im developing using the sun SDK on linux.p  pPS I would also be interested in any alternatives to Lucene with an applet as Im not crazy about this solution.p

Negative 2751 pI have a little program I wrote to download all NuGet packages for a solution.  I would like to setup a prebuild event that would run this program every time I build.p  pBut I need it to run before the first project starts to build.

Negative 2751 pThank you for reading this.p  pThese are my first steps in the iPhone Ipad app programming. In order to learn from scratch and because I know my app would need dynamic views, I decided not to use Interface Builder.p  pMy question isregarding the fact that I dont use IB how would one use Views and Controllersp  pI think I understand the MVC concept as it is repeated over and over again in the tutorials I follow,  but after the MVC explanation part, nothing is made to make it clear on the field and closer to the real world Earth being Xcode here. Worse, sometimes it seems that some tutorials mix these two concepts up and use one word to say the other.p  pI read around here a lot of questions and answers of course based on the matter but I still dont get it. Sometimes its too generic, sometimes its too specific for me at least.p  pFor what I think I understood, the UIView is the static View when the View Controller is the logic which links the View to the data and those 3 concepts must be separated. This separation, while a bit clearer with the use of Interface Builder seems to get quite blurry when you code everything as it becomes a virtual soup.p  pTechnically, should I create a specific .h and .m file for each View AND ALSO for each associated Controller If I understand the MVC pattern, its seems that I should but when I follow tutorials without IB it is never the case, view and controllers are created and manipulated within the same implementation files.p  pAny high level Im a noob, dont forget but still applicable explanation of the use and best practicesp  pLets say I want to create a simple app with a green view I can swipe to get to a red view. I know for sure that I would need at least anp  ul lixxxappDelegate.hli lixxxappDelegate.mli lixxxView.hli lixxxView.mli ul  pWhat elsep  p1Where should I put the the second view along with the first one in xxxView or should I create another class h and m filep  p2 What would the controllers do, for that kind of application In which files would they be created and in which files would they be invoked and how would they control the related viewp  p3 Mainly, regarding to MVC pattern and the fact that there would be no IB, how would you organize that appp  pI know its a lot if you go into the details and code but thats not the point here.p  pThank you. This  as simple as it seems  would be of a great help and is not as easily found in tutorials as you might think. I understand the tutorials I read but they are so particular. As soon as I try to create something on my own which is not a Hello World screen, I realize that something is missing, logic wise.p  pThank you very much for your help.p

On the a hrefhttpwww.csie.ntu.edu.twcjlinlibsvmtoolsdatasets relnofollowLIBSVMWebsitea several ExampleData can be downloaded. The ExampleData is either prepared as CSVFiles or as readytouse Training and Testdata.p  pIf you look at the Values which are in the CSVFile, the first column are the labels lying person or not and the other Values are the extracted features, but I still cant reconstruct how those values are achieved.p  pI dont know if its that simple that nobody has to mention it, but I just cant get trough it, so if anybody knows how to perform the feature extraction from Images, please help me.p  pThank you in advance, Regardsp

Negative 2751 pIm currently trying to analyze large data sets 40 000 data points with matlab. These data sets have a large degree of high frequency noise, luckily however, the noise is of a relatively small amplitude compared to the overall signal.p  pBasically, what i wish to do is to find the point at which a data set kicks up. By kicking up i mean, its gradient changes significantly over a small region. However, these signals that im analyzing suffer from drift where by, before the kick up point the signals slope may be negative, neutral or positive in nature, however, the shape of the graph before and after the kick up point is generally the same. p  peg a kick up point would look something like thisp  blockquote   p[ 1.25 2.5 3.75 5 7.5 12 21 36 49 64 ]p blockquote  pObviously this is a massively simplified version but the data would follow a straight line like curve first 5 data points in the above and then it would follow a more exponential like curve point 6 onwards.p  pSo ive been looking at implementing a machine type learning algorithm whereby i can tell matlab where a kick up point is as well as the shape of data where a kick up point occurs such that in the future it can accurately locate kick up points. p  pIm relatively new to both Matlab and machine learningif machine learning is even the best way of going about solving my problem and i have no idea where i should begin. I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction, be it matlab code examples andor some beginner theory with coding implementation.p
Negative 2751 pI have seen many answers for how to disable the onKeyup setting that the MVC3 Remote Validator has. The responses I have seen is to enter this p  precode.validator.setDefaults onkeyup false  codepre  pHowever I am not certain where to put this.  I have tried putting it in its own script block at the head of my layout view, I have tried putting it in the jquery.validate.js file of my MVC3 project.  Neither seems to work.  So where do I put this script within my project to make it workp
Negative 2751 pIts hard to explain in a single line, my problem is that I need to use accordion and I thought that when none of its items are expanded, it would use the space only required by headers.p  pThis is not true, but I need a functionality where accordion will use the height that is actually using. So if its using 30px because the content of the current header requires only 30, it doesnt force my body to grow a lot.p  pIf I change the header to one that require 1000px height, then the accordion should use 1000px forcing my body to growp  pHow is possible to reach this behaviourp  pThanksp

Negative 2751 pI am trying to profile a Qt window application that I am developing and have read up on the methods to profile using gprof. I have successfully configure the project to compile and link with the pg flags to enable profiling and the gmon.out is output everytime the the application is executed. However when I tried to run gprof to convert the gmon.out file into a readable txt file, I ran into the gmon.out too short to be a gmon file error message.

Negative 2751 pI have two buttons on the web page. The web page displays a pdf form that has several fields with validations. By validations I mean some are mandatory fields and some are conditional. if all these validations are done succesfully then you can submit the pdf form.p  pPROBLEM I enter few fields, click on save, it saves the data. next I click on submit it prompts me to fill all other fields and submit is disabled which is correct. Now, I fill all other fields and click on save. Submit button is enabled. I click on submit button, it causes a postback and reloads the page.

I rarely work with others, so all I need is version control for peace of mind and ability to rollback etc. I also develop from a laptop and desktop at the studio, so I would like to use version control so I can work from different locations and avoid conflicts that emerge from that.p  pI have done a fair bit of research, and most tutorials are rather advanced and seem beyond my needs. Basically, I have decided on an SVN repository from beanstalk and Versions.app to work with it.p  pHowever, I have three quick questions I would love to answer before really diving into a solutionp  ul lipIs it really necessary to use a typical SVN structure trunkbranchestags Can I not simply use the repo as the webrootpli lipHow can I benefit from Branches Beanstalk recommends deploying from branches. From what I understand, this could mean creating a Production branch, then merging to that branch from the Trunk before deploying Is there a reason not to simply deploy from the Trunk or just having a webroot in SVN and deploying that I suppose I am mainly asking why, as a single developer, I would want to use branches in developing websitespli lipIs there any reason I could benefit from GIT The one main feature I could see if offline commits, but beanstalk even recommends SVN for web development files html, php, images etc.pli ul  pAny help greatly appreciated. Ive been wanting to use a version control system and develop offline for some time now. Hopefully no more editing live servers for me I think getting the right workflow down is a time and energy intensive project in the beginning, but so well worth it in the end.p  pp  pedit I am developing mostly wordpress websites, and various EE projects on a reasonably small scale, nothing too intense.p  pp  pstrongeditstrong As with everything, working with the system and trying it out is the only way to really get to know it. In the end, I opted for git. I was very happy with being able to commit offline quickly, to do quick branches and merging etc. Then, deployment with capistrano, while initially complex to setup, has been unbelievable. My workflow is so fantastically improved now. I can branch new features quickly and try out new ideas. I will never develop a project again without gitp

Negative 2751 pHow will ICE do when one proxy is shared by multithread Will the requests be queued on the same connection which is behind the proxy Though a proxy can bind to different connections, at a time a proxy can only use one connection.p  pFor example, I have get a proxy named proxyA using stringToProxy method. In order to access remote service, I create two threads using the proxy as construct parameter and use the same proxy in both threads. Is this the right way to do so or I need create two proxies or create proxy every time before I need to use proxyp  pFrom my knowledge, I choose the way to create proxy every time when needed because proxy is light weighted and the established connections will be cached by ICE run time and reused by later created proxy. Here all proxies are to connect to the same server and port.p

Negative 2751 pIve created a music discovery webapp that Im trying to integrate with Facebook. The frontend is essentially an interactive experience using HTML5s Canvas, meaning that it all exists within one page. p  pI have some html code that exists over the canvas to display a facebook like button. This like button corresponds to the song thats currently viewed in the canvas app. Using jquery, Im dynamically changing the codehrefcode of the codefblikecode, which works just fine. Similarly, Im changing the URL of the site using codewindow.history.pushStatecode.p  pThis works fine, except that the message thats printed on a users feed when clicking the like button always pertains to the original page that was loaded AKA the webapp without any songs loaded. As such, I started looking at using OpenGraph to alter said message. p  pAccording to facebooks page on like buttons p  blockquote   pstrongWhen does Facebook scrape my pagestrongp      pFacebook needs to scrape your page to know how to display it around   the site.p      pFacebook scrapes your page every 24 hours to ensure the properties are   up to date. The page is also scraped when an admin for the Open Graph   page clicks the Like button and when the URL is entered into the   Facebook URL Linter. Facebook observes cache headers on your URLs  it   will look at Expires and CacheControl in order of preference.   However, even if you specify a longer time, Facebook will scrape your   page every 24 hours.p blockquote  pAs per above, I am now creating my own urls that change dynamically without reloading the site each time the song is changed. I can relatively easily recode my server so that if anybody requests one of those URLs, the returned HTML file will include the meta tags that correspond to the song in question. Lets pretend that I do this and I write a script to curl all those urls to facebook. If a user now clicks a like button on my webapp that corresponds to a given song, will the message correspond to the meta tags that were previously scraped by facebook, or would it just be the regular message that Im receiving currently that is misleadingp  pBest,br Samip  pPS If nobody knows the answer to this, Ill code everything up tomorrow and let you all know.p  pPPS On a related note, does anybody know if using OpenGraph to alter the text of a like button click needs the codescopepublicactionscode attribute to be set to the codefblikecode element in the HTML codep

Negative 2751 pMy crosstab query see below runs just fine. However, I have to generate a large number of such queries, and  crucially  the number of column definitions will vary from day to day. If the number of output columndefs does not match that of the second argument of the crosstab, the crosstab will throw and error and abort. Therefore, I cannot hardwire the column definitions as in my current query, and I need instead a function which will ensure that column definitions will be synchronized onthefly.

Indeed, if I inspect the object in Firebug I dont see this method.  I also dont see css or any other useful things that might help me set the color of the row.  Can anyone tell me why Im not getting the type of object I expect  Or how to use the object Ive got to set the color  I do see a style parameter in the object.  Maybe I can use thatp  pPlease, please, please, can someone help me out with either or both of these problemsp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2751 pI recently built a prototype c console application to read in measurements from four instruments in parallelOn the same TimeStamp, I used the parallel.invoke command to do so, The results were quite good every single time.

So in my DoWork i call this parallel.invoke to run the four functions to get readings, but the results are returned after so long and they are not on the same time stamp, I did try it without background worker but i have the same results. Any one has idea why parallel.invoke is behaving so. That it works fine in console application and not in winform.

Negative 2751 pIm planning a database structure which is going to store quite a bit of data. We need to store 50 different columns of data for each item.

Negative 2751 pI have a problem with the Autofac ExtensibleActionInvoker interacting with the MVC ModelBinder when using interfaces for parameters. The background is as follows p  pI am building a MVC application and I am using Autofac MVC3s ExtensibleActionInvoker to inject my services as parameters to my actions, e.g.p  precode    public ActionResult Test IMyService service              A new instance of service is created by Autofac ExtensibleActionInvoker          return View      codepre  pThis works really well and makes for a really clean design see a hrefhttpalexmg.compost20100516IntroducingActionInjectionwithAutofacASPNETMVCIntegration.aspx relnofollowAlex MeyerGleaves posta for more information on this approach. I want to use this method as I am producing a code generator to create actions, views, services and DTOs and a peraction service approach makes this easier.p  pHowever I also want to use interfaces for the parameters in action classed which receive input from an HttpPost action. This is because I use DI to create classes outside each layer. If I change the DefaultModelBinder to use DI to create the class see page 595 of Steve Sandersons book on MVC3 on how to do this this this works fine, e.g.p  precode    [HttpPost]     public ActionResult TestITestClass dataComingFromView              model binder creates the class via DI and then binds it to the data from the post         return View      codepre  pHowever in the above simple example above I get a conflict with the ExtensibleActionInvoker enabled, i.e. p  ol liWithout ExtensibleActionInvoker enabled the method above works fine, i.e. the extended DefaultModelBinder uses DI to create the TestClass class and modelbinder binds input from the view to the fields in the class.li liWith ExtensibleActionInvoker enabled it does not work, i.e. I get an empty TestClass class with no binding. I assume the ExtensibleActionInvoker takes precedence over the model binder and just creates an empty TestClass class.li liJust for completeness I should say that if I just use MVC out of the box, i.e. no new DefaultModelBinder and no ExtensibleActionInvoker enabled, then it says you cannot use an interface as an Action method parameter.li ol  pMy question for anyone with better Autofac knowledge than me is can I change the Autofac ExtensibleActionInvoker to select what it binds to All my injected service classed start with IService so I could filter on that. I know you can do that in Autofac elsewhere but couldnt see anything to do that with ExtensibleActionInvoker, but maybe I missed it.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pJon Smith  Selective Analyticsp

Negative 2751 pI am currently developing a ASP.NET MVC4 website, and I would like to know whats the best practices storing the loggedon users data include privileges and authorize the user securely, being able to access this data in both my views and controllers.p  pOne thing to important mention  I am strongNOT using the Membership classstrong Ive saw that its an overhead for me to use it, and I would like to implement the exact things I need and learn from the process.p  pThe only way I thought to do it is storing all the data inside the session object, and having a wrapper to the session object static class and use it like codeSessionManager.IsLoggedIncode, codeSessionManager.GetUserPriviligescode or simply creating a method that returns hardtyped UserSessionData codeSessionManager.GetSessionDatacode that contains all the data required.  This is one way to use it in both controllers and views. Shall I derive from Controller and create a codeRolesControllercode which stores UserSessionData so I wont need to call it again and again in my controllersp  pI guess I wont be able to use the common codeAuthorizedAttributecode so I will have to implement it by using the session wrapper Is it safe to use only the session data since I am not using the official authorization method and therefore I dont really know how it should be implemented.p  pAs you see, I have an idea but since its my first time doing it I would like to learn about the best practices and the way it should be done correctly. I will be thankful if you will explain your answers since I want to get the complete idea and I havent done it before in MVC.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2751 pOkay so I am writing a program for the game Yahtzee, and I am trying to figure out how to store the value of each round in that rounds scorecard box, and continuing to fill out the other sections of the scorecard. The way I am doing this is by this section of my codep  precode  public static void finalScoreCardint choice, int points     int ones  onechoice, points  int twos  twochoice, points  int threes  threechoice, points  int fours  fourchoice, points  int fives  fivechoice, points  int sixes  sixchoice, points  int threeKind  ninechoice, points  int fourKind  tenchoice, points  int fullHouse  elevenchoice, points  int smallStr  twelvechoice, points  int largeStr  thirteenchoice, points  int yahtzee  fourteenchoice, points  int chance  fifteenchoice, points    public static int oneint choice, int points   final int score if choice  1     score  points  if choice  1 ampamp score  points     return 0 else     return score   codepre  pso the one method is supposed to take in the choice number and points parameters, and then return the score if that box is chosen.  I want my program to instantiate score if the user picks that choice option, and assign score with points. And then after they have done this, the method should just return the score after every round, or return 0 until score has been instantiated. The thing is, I do not understand how to save the value of score multiple times around. This whole program is in a for loop that runs 13 times.  Thanksp

Negative 2751 ptrimmed down test page at www.armstrongvisuals.comtester.php reel linkp  pMy fancybox2 implementation of youtube videos displays off the Fancybox center in only Safari, with a flexslider slideshow in the page.  The Fancybox overlay window is sized and positioned correctly, but the youtube content is halfway outside the fancybox overlay vertically and horizontally.  Safari seems to be relying on incorrect window width and height.  The video moves separately from the fancybox as you resize the window.  I have a Flexslider slideshow in the page and I know Flexslider has overflow issues.  Been troubleshooting on my local server. Updating the Flexslider did not solve the problem.  Right now, Im attempting to refine the fancybox.js to rely on innerheight and innerwidth, but would love some help.  Hoping the issue sounds familiar to someone who knows Fancybox.

Negative 2751 pI have been trying to author a Chrome extension recently and have been hitting major problems it seems every step of the way.p  pCurrently I have a local HTML page that is using a local Javascript library.  This works great, except Chrome a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebtoolkitdoclatestDevGuideHtml5Storage relnofollowlimits the amount of data a page can store to 5MBa.  I would like to get around this limit, and read that Chrome extensionsapplications could use unlimited storage resources via chrome.storage.p  pWhile coding, I quickly discovered that this only applies to browser actions, content scripts, and  web applications loading an WWW page as an extension.  I was coding this as a local packaged app, which does NOT have access to either the HTML5 localStorage API NOR the chrome.storage API.  I emreallyem need the extension to use only local HTMLJavascript resources in order to maintain offlinenointernet functionality.p  pCan a Chrome web app be loaded from a local resource, i.e. a locally packaged HTML page  Is there any way around these problems that does not include enabling dangerous security vulnerabilities in Chrome  I saw that an NPAPI app could solve the problem however that also defeats the purpose of the application I am making.p  pTIA, Trannp

Negative 2751 pI need to use random in a multithreaded loop, but require the same values through each loop independent of which thread is evaluating that cycle.p  pWithout multithreading I can dop  precodeseed1 for unsigned int i0 ilt100 i      rand  codepre  pWithin the loop each time rand will be called it will return a new pseudorandom value. Now I want to create the same list multithreaded.p  pThe main reason is that I need the same sequence of pseudorandom numbers independent of the order of the loop so more like based on i within the loop.p  pNote Ive been going through many random and multithreading topics but only found solutions on how to make sure the numbers are always random, not the other way around.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe result should be as if based on a seed a random list is created. And that random list should be used within the loop with index i to get the pseudorandom value. So within the loop the same random number will be at index i based on the seed. Yet there shouldnt be a single random number same throughout the loop. But the sequence should be the same for each program run. Independent of number of threads or which thread is evaluating a part of the cycle.p  pIt wouldnt be very efficient to create that list nonmultithreaded and use that initialized list within the multithreaded loop. Any thoughts on thisp

Negative 2751 pI am trying to implement a fragment which holds a ListView bound to a custom adapter. Basically, one row looks like this TextViewName  ButtonPlus TextViewMarker ButtonMinus  ButtonRemove The buttons plus and minus alter the number displayed by TextViewMarker. ButtonRemove removes a row from the list. Finally, there is a button to add new items in the list. Everything seems to work fine since I can add and remove items and change the number of markers at runtime. Unfortunately, if I remove an item, the next item in the list takes the number of markers of the removed item. Just like if the ViewHolder was still at the same place and that the next item just changed his tag.

Negative 2751 pI have a GWT Cell Tree that I use to display a file structure from a CMS. I am using a codeAsyncDataProvidercode that loads data from a custom RPC class I created.

This is the first dependency injection container out of 5 that Ive used that makes the distinction. The others just allow you to register multiple types against a service and then load them all up by calling codeResolveltIEnumerableltTServicegtgtcode autofac or codeGetAllInstancesltTServicegtcode both SimpleInjector and Ninject.p  h2Updateh2  pFor more clarity, Im trying to build a list of items that I can pass to a composite that handles each of the individual items. It suffers from the same problem as the above since it falls into a group of tasks that all get registered to be run based on schedules, triggers, and events Rx. To remove the register all for a moment and rip out some of the other stuffp  precodecontainer.RegisterltITaskgt gt new FileWatchTask     container.GetInstanceltIFileSystemgt,     container.GetInstanceltIMessageSubscriptionManagerServicegt,     configuration,     container.GetAllInstancesltIFileWatchergt codepre  pYou can see that I am grabbing all instances of the previously registered file watchers.p  pstrongWhat I need to know is a simple workaround for this issue and when it will be implemented or if not, why it wont be. I will also accept that this is not possible given the current limitations of Simple Injectors design. What I will not accept is that I need to change and adapt my architecture to meet the limitations of a tool.strong p  h2Update 2h2  pLets talk about OCP Open Closed Principle aka the O in SOLID and the impression Im getting in how SimpleInjector breaks this particular principle in some cases.p  pOpen Closed Principle is just that, open for extension, but closed for modification. What this means is that you can alter the behavior of an entity without altering its source code. p  pNow lets shift to an example that is relevant herep  precodevar tasks  container.GetAllInstancesltITaskgt foreach var task in tasks.OrEmptyListIfNull    registers the task with the scheduler, Rx Event Messaging, or another trigger of some sort     task.Initialize  codepre  pNotice how clean that is. To be able to do this though, I need to be able to register all instances of an interfacep  precodecontainer.RegisterAllltITaskgt    new ListltFuncltITaskgtgt      gt new FileWatchTaskcontainer.GetInstanceltIFileSystemgt,container.GetInstanceltIMessageSubscriptionManagerServicegt,configuration,container.GetAllInstancesltIFileWatchergt,      gt new DefaultFtpTaskcontainer.GetInstanceltIFtpClientgt,container.GetInstanceltIFileSystemgt,      gt new DefaultImportFilesTaskcontainer.GetInstanceltIFileSystemgt     codepre  pRight So the lesson here is that this is good and meeting OCP. I can change the behavior of the task runner simply by adding or removing items that are registered. Open for extension, closed for modification.p  pNow lets focus on trying to do it the way suggested in the answer below strongprior to the second update, which finally answers this questionstrong, which the author is giving the impression to be a better design.p  pLets start with what the answer from the maintainer mentions is good design for registration. The viewpoint that Im getting is that I have to make a sacrifice to my code to somehow make the ITask more flexible to work with SimpleInjectorp  precodecontainer.RegisterltITaskltSomeGeneric1gt gt new FileWatchTaskcontainer.GetInstanceltIFileSystemgt,container.GetInstanceltIMessageSubscriptionManagerServicegt,configuration,container.GetAllInstancesltIFileWatchergt container.RegisterltITaskltSomeGeneric2gt gt new DefaultFtpTaskcontainer.GetInstanceltIFtpClientgt,container.GetInstanceltIFileSystemgt container.RegisterltITaskltSomeGeneric3gt gt new DefaultImportFilesTaskcontainer.GetInstanceltIFileSystemgt codepre  pNow lets see how that makes our design changep  precodevar task1  container.GetInstancesltITaskltSomeGeneric1gt task1.Initialize var task2  container.GetInstancesltITaskltSomeGeneric2gt task2.Initialize var task3  container.GetInstancesltITaskltSomeGeneric3gt task3.Initialize codepre  pOuch. You can see how every time I add or remove an item from the container registration, I now need to also update another section of code. Two places of modification for one change, Im breaking multiple design issues.  p  pYou might say why am I asking the container for this Well this is in the startup area, but lets explore if I wasnt.p  pSo I will use constructor injection to illustrate why this is bad. First lets see my example as construction injection.p  precodepublic class SomeClass      public SomeClassIEnumerableltITaskgt tasks  codepre  pNice and clean.p  pNow, lets switch back to my understanding of the accepted answers view again prior to update 2p  precodepublic class SomeClass      public SomeClassITaskltGeneric1gt task1,                      ITaskltGeneric2gt task2,                      ITaskltGeneric3gt task3                         codepre  pOuch. Everytime I have to edit multiple areas of code, and lets not even get started at how poor this design is.p  pWhats the lesson here Im not the smartest guy in the world. I maintain or try to maintain  multiple frameworks and I dont try to pretend I know more than or better than others. My sense of design might be skewed or I might be limiting others in some unknown way that I have not even thought of yet. Im sure the author means well when he gives advice on design, but in some cases it may come across annoying and a little condescending, especially for those of us that know what we are doing.p  h2Update 3h2  pSo the question was answered in Update 2 from the maintainer. I was trying to use RegisterAll because it hadnt occurred to me that I could just use codeRegisterltIEnumerableltTgtgtcode and unfortunately the documentation didnt point this out. It seems totally obvious now, but when people are making the jump from other IoC frameworks, they are carrying some baggage with them and may miss this awesome simplification in design I missed it, with 4 other DI containers under my belt. Hopefully he adds it to the documentation or calls it out a little better.p

Negative 2751 pWriting a JIT compiler in C on 64bit Windows, generated code will sometimes need to call runtime functions that are written in C. At the moment Im allocating memory in which to place the generated code with codeVirtualAlloc0, bytes, MEMCOMMIT, PAGEEXECUTEREADWRITEcode the last flag is important because allocated memory is not otherwise executable.p  pcodeVirtualAlloccode could presumably return memory anywhere in the 64bit address space, which is fine for data of which in general more than 4 gigabytes will be needed, so it does need 64bit addressing, but the most efficient form of the x64 codecallcode instruction wants a 32bit IPrelative offset, and since the amount of generated code will be less than 4 gigabytes, it would be preferable to locate it within a 32bit displacement of the code compiled from C.p  pIs there a way to arrange thisp
Negative 2751 pI need to store data from parsed codeXMLcode, I have no problem with the parsing, that I can handle. The problem is that I receive a table data basically where each time the column names, columns number and the data it self are different. Now I dont want to use codeSQLitecode Database as I have a small number of entries and I dont see it feet for this situation. I even think I cant use it as I will have to create a new table for each data set I will receive.

Negative 2751 pTony here, and I am a totally new person to the whole arduino world.p  pFirst my project, my equipment, why I decided to use arduino, what I am attempting to do, and the code I am using. p  pMy project is relatively simple the ability to pan and tilt 2 cameras that weight .06 ounce.  The cameras are being used to record the weather.  The programming below works, but the problem I am having is that the servos return to the zero or do we call it the 90 location when I release the joystick.  The joysticks I am using are the same type used in the Playstation 2 game pads.  They allow for a Z axis which for me, I would like to use as a way to keep a camera pointed in the direction I last positioned it to, until the time I wish to pan or tilt it to a different axis.  I hope I explained it clearly.  p  pLastly I do not want to use wireless, I wish to have it hard wired as I believe it will cause less interference by other radio frequencies in my area.p  pMy equipment or components are as followsp  precode Arduino UNO board   Bread board   Circuit board   2 Joysticks Playstation 2 style with X, Y and Z axis   4 TowerPro servo motors SG5010 codepre  pI decided to use arduino, because it was recommended to me by computer  electronic shop personnel.  I have no prior knowledge of coding arduino or any other type of programming.  I was however able to take coding for 1 joystick and 2 servos, and expand it to include an additional joystick and 2 additional servos.  So as stated, I have coding for 4 servos and 2 joysticks, I just cannot and do not understand what I need to do in order to get the Z axis enabled to do what I stated above.p  pI apologize to those that are more experienced, that I bring this here, but I really am in need of assistance.p  pThe codingp  precodeinclude ltServo.hgt  const int servo1  3         first servo const int servo2  11       second servo const int servo3  6         third servo const int servo4  10      fourth servo const int joyH  3            LR Parallax Thumbstick const int joyV  4            UD Parallax Thumbstick const int joyI  1              LR Parallax Thumbstick const int joyW  2           UD Parallax Thumbstick int servoVal            variable to read the value from the analog pin  Servo myservo1   create servo object to control a servo Servo myservo2   create servo object to control a servo Servo myservo3   create servo object to control a servo Servo myservo4   create servo object to control a servo  void setup       Servo       myservo1.attachservo1   attaches the servo     myservo2.attachservo2   attaches the servo     myservo3.attachservo3   attaches the servo     myservo4.attachservo4   attaches the servo       Inizialize Serial     Serial.begin9600   void loop      Display Joystick values using the serial monitor     outputJoystick       Read the horizontal joystick value  value between 0 and 1023     servoVal  analogReadjoyH      servoVal  mapservoVal, 0, 1023, 0, 179   scale it to use it with the servo result  between 0 and 179 to keep from being jittery      myservo2.writeservoVal                   sets the servo position according to the scaled value           Read the horizontal joystick value  value between 0 and 1023     servoVal  analogReadjoyV                servoVal  mapservoVal, 0, 1023, 0, 179       scale it to use it with the servo result  between 0 and 179 to keep from being jittery     myservo4.writeservoVal                            sets the servo position according to the scaled value       Read the horizontal joystick value  value between 0 and 1023     servoVal  analogReadjoyI                servoVal  mapservoVal, 0, 1023, 0, 179       scale it to use it with the servo result  between 0 and 179 to keep from being jittery     myservo1.writeservoVal                            sets the servo position according to the scaled value       Read the horizontal joystick value  value between 0 and 1023     servoVal  analogReadjoyW                servoVal  mapservoVal, 0, 1023, 0, 179       scale it to use it with the servo result  between 0 and 179 to keep from being jittery      myservo3.writeservoVal                            sets the servo position according to the scaled value      delay15                                        waits for the servo to get there      Display joystick values    void outputJoystick     Serial.printanalogReadjoyH     Serial.print       Serial.printanalogReadjoyV     Serial.println      Serial.printanalogReadjoyI     Serial.print       Serial.printanalogReadjoyW     Serial.println   codepre  pThanks for taking the time to help me.

Negative 2751 pOk so I found a thread about someone who wants to add a navigation controller to this tab application but I want it differently. I have a working app where the user selects an animal. When the user selects an animal from the first Viewcontroller from the UITableView list a second screen loads with a picture and some overal information about the animal.p  pNow when the user gets in the second ViewController I want a tab bar at the bottom with 34 options. Those options refer for 34 new viewcontrollers. For example 1 representing the food they eat, 1 with their natural enemies etc.p  pIt is really hard to find workable code for me. Or should I just go for a Tabbed application But I actually really dont want that because of my first screen with all the animals.p  pWho can help me out p

Negative 2751 pI have successfully extended the MySQLi class in PHP, however I am having issues correctly extending and then implementing the mysqliresult and mysqlistmt classes after being extended. I have looked through a hrefhttpsgithub.comphpphpsrc relnofollowhttpsgithub.comphpphpsrca which is supposed to contain all the PHP source code and I have been unable to locate these classes to extrapolate a solution. If anyone could provide an example with the mysqliresult class being extended and implemented, and then another with the mysqlistmt class being extended and implemented that would be greatly appreciated. Either that or the source files to the mysqliresult and mysqlistmt classes so I can determine a solution. Thank you.p

Negative 2751 pIve got a project that works where Im sending 3 different NSManagedObjects 3 NSDictionaries and receivingstoring properly in Core Data ParentChild.   The current solution is sending the Dicts individually sendDataToAllPeers.  On the receipt side it appears to be taking about 1030 seconds to arrive into didReceiveData, and then it processes one by one.  This is most likely due to the fact that Ive stuffed image strings into 2 of the entities the payload is larger.  Regardless, what Id like to achieve is a sold end user experience where it receives all at one time Ill throw up a HUD for indicating its receivingprocessing...  Is there a Recommended way to bundle the entire payload of NSdicts and stream it over and of course Reconstruct  By the way I am NSCodingDecoding.  A choppy User Experience Im trying to make smooth.p

Negative 2751 pI like to hear your suggestion for the problem I am facing with infrastructure management. p  pProblem Having a server I should be able to create or connect to multiple client system alled nodes to install, run some scripts, generate reports etc.,p  pTo resolve this problem, I found chefpuppet is a good solution but on trying I found that both chef and puppet needs to initiate the process from client side inside the server pushing the instruction from server. Say like in chef when I tried, I need to create a cron job that initiate the chefclient to talk to server to look for any new cookbooks and follow the recipes and execute them. The whole infrastructure fits the problem but except that I want to access the server to say install so and so stuff in this particular node which already established a connection with the server. p  pIs there a any existing framework to make this happen I tried both chef and puppet and frustrated on negative results or probably I am missing something on them. Correct me and kindly chip in your suggestions. Thanks in adavancep

Negative 2751 pI used CRF to learn a model with around 6,000 sentences. The trained model has been tested and it proved to work perfectly. Then, I increased the number of sentences to 120,000 sentences. The problem is when I trained the model using the following command linep  precodecrflearn template traindata model codepre  pAfter crflearn.exe reading the training data, it suddenly stops working and an error message appears which closed the program and prevented it from completing the steps. the error message says      crflearn.exe has stopped working correctly.

Negative 2751 pIm currently trying to make a piece of code written in VS 2012, using Microsoft.Bcl.Async and .NET 4.0, work in VS 2010. For VS 2010 Ive installed the Async CTP ver. 3, such that I am able to compile my project written in V S2012.p  pAfter quite a lot of trouble getting the Async CTP pack to work, I am now able to compile my project under both VS 2012 as well as VS 2010. p  pHowever, Im seeing some differences in how the code works in runtime.

Running the code from VS 2010, however, is a far different story. The async method works as intended, but the sync wrapper method simply hangs, and the result is never produced.p  pSince I am fairly new to the concept of TPL and asyncwait, Im having some trouble explaining the behavior I am seeing here. Is there some sort of limitations in the Async CTP that kicks in, that I am not aware of, or am I doing this in a conceptually wrong wayp

Negative 2751 pMy company is responsible for backups on a number of servers for one of our clients. The backup servers are all running Backup Exec 2010. At the end of each month we need to provide a report on how many jobs failed during the month, the reason etc. Currently our techs check a number of successfail emails each day and record the results in a database. The monthly report then pulls the data from here.p  pWhat I am looking at doing now is automating the procedure of a human having to read the successfail emails every day.

The same way doesnt seem to work for codeJFileChoosercode at least I cant figure it out. p  pHow can I add an codeActionListenercode to my codeJFileChoosercode that fires when the user clicks strongOKstrong. And can I pass the selected file path as argument in the listener as wellp

Negative 2751 pCommunity, I am going to attempt to explain my situation as best as possible so my question makes sense.  I start off with a single row broken up into a few fields.  If any one of the cells in the first row has a value other than null or  It duplicates a blank second row.  This is so on and so forth.  The first column in each row has three options.  Pending on which of these three options is selected, should populate the second column accordingly per row.p  pExample 1  List 1p  pExample 2  List 2p  pExample 3  List 3p  pCurrently the second column is set to this list data validation valueAAAAp  pEach row in AA  HLOOKUPA10,UW,AB1,FALSE Where the cell row in AB increments down the list.p  pObviously, the issue comes in here.  A10 will always populate B10 properly.  Every row after that BX will always populate the same list that A10 populates regardless of what AX equals.p  pI want to know how I can validate each row accordingly to the selection in row Ap
Negative 2751 pI am writing a macro that will eventually hopefully read part numbers from an excel or text file, then search through the configs of my parts library and insert the corresponding components into an assembly, then make the corresponding confign active. p  pI have a problem when it comes to inserting the parts and or assemblies.  I started off by recording a macro of inserting a part. Pretty simple. It uses the AddComponent command, which needs a filepath and xyz coordinates. This seemed to work ok but It kept glitching up.  From what Ive been able to figure out this command cannot insert a part or assembly UNLESS that part or assembly has already been used during the current session of solidworks. p  precodeOption Base 1  Dim swApp As Object  Dim Part As Object  Dim SelMgr As Object  Dim boolstatus As Boolean  Dim longstatus As Long, longwarnings As Long  Dim Feature As Object  Dim filepath As String  Dim partnum8 As String  Dim posx As Integer  Dim posy As Integer  Dim posz As Integer  Dim x As Integer   Sub main  Set swApp  Application.SldWorks  Set Part  swApp.ActiveDoc  Set SelMgr  Part.SelectionManager   posx  0  posy  0  posz  0   partnum1  07010304  partnum2  07010318  partnum3  07010321  partnum4  07010331   For x  1 To 8 filepath  CDocuments and SettingsuserMy DocumentsSolid Works TestingParts partnumx  .SLDPRT  Part.AddComponent filepath, posx, posy, posz  filepath  CDocuments and SettingsuserMy DocumentsSolid Works TestingAssemblies  partnumx  .SLDASM  Part.AddComponent filepath, posx, posy, posz  posx  posx  1.5  Next   End Sub  codepre  pThis macro grabs three parts 07010304.SLDPRT, 07010318.SLDPRT, etc. an assembly made up of those parts and inserts them into the active assembly, spacing them out as it does so.   p  ol liIf I open an assembly and run the macro, nothing happens.   li liIf I open an assembly, insert the cube, delete it, then run the macro, it inserts the cube.  li liIf I open an assembly, insert all the parts, delete them, then run the macro, it inserts all the parts but not the assembly made up of two of them.  li liIf I open an assembly, insert the cubesphere assembly, delete it, and run the macro, it will insert the cube, the sphere, and the cubesphere assembly, but not the cylinder.  li liIf the parts have been used in one assembly, and another is opened or made active, then the macro works fine in the new window. li ol  pSo In conclusion, how do I fix this Is there another command to insert parts that doesnt rely on the loaded into SW memory thing that seems to be happening Or a command to do just that and load the parts into SW memoryp

Negative 2751 pIm working on a JSF 2 application that is composed of a emcoreem component that can be emextendedem by usually client specific code. Generally speaking the extended parts of the application precede the core ones.p  pFor the Java code this is done by using conventional mechanisms. For the presentation layer, we use a codejavax.faces.view.facelets.ResourceResolvercode implementation that first tries to find resources in the emextensionem jar before the emcoreem resources are used.p  pWe use a lot of composite components for reusable markup. Think of components for showing addresses, salaries, etc. p  pThe Facelets are causing major headaches when it comes to the emextendableem nature of the application and Im starting to wonder if there is a solution for the problems that we run into.p  pWhat we want to achieve, is having a strongstandard interfacestrong for composite components, but override the implementation somehow by resolving strongmultiple implementationsstrong, out of which the emextendedem implementation should precede the core implementation.p  pThe idea of course is, that the emcoreem defines the standard layouttemplating of the application, and emextensionsem define clientspecific formatting options, or hidingshowing part of the managed model that the application does.p  pFor examplep  precodeltuicomposition      xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml      xmlnscchttpjava.sun.comjsfcomposite     xmlnsuihttpjava.sun.comjsffacelets      xmlnspuihttpjava.sun.comjsfcompositepuigt      ltccinterfacegt         ltccattribute namesaveButtonLabel gt         ltccattribute namesaveButtonIcon gt         ltccattribute namesaveButtonIconPosition gt     ltccinterfacegt      ltccimplementationgt         ltpuipensionplancustomstate pensionPlanBeanpensionPlanBean gt         ltpuipensionplangeneral pensionPlanBeanpensionPlanBean gt         ltpuipensionplanpensionplan pensionPlanBeanpensionPlanBean gt         ltpuipensionplansalary pensionPlanBeanpensionPlanBean gt         ltpuipensionplaninvestments pensionPlanBeanpensionPlanBean gt         ltpuipensionplanbenefittypes benefitTypespensionPlanBean.benefitTypesViewData gt          ltdiv classbuttonsgt             lt Irrelevant gt         ltdivgt     ltccimplementationgt ltuicompositiongt codepre  pTake the codepensionplanbenefittypescode composite component for example. Its interface prescribes that an attribute by the name codebenefitTypescode is to be given by the client. If a client wants just this part of the screen to be overwritten by different content than the standard implementation would so, we need a place to overwrite this somewhere.p  pAlso note, that the emcoreem does not know about the namespaces that the optional emextensionem provides. The emcoreem doesnt really care, as long as the interface of the composite is stable and doesnt require changes.p  pAs a last resort, the following has been tried pseudo codep  precodeltuicomposition     xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml      xmlnscchttpjava.sun.comjsfcomposite     xmlnsuihttpjava.sun.comjsffacelets      xmlnspuihttpjava.sun.comjsfcompositepuigt      ltccinterfacegt         ltccattribute namebenefitTypes requiredtrue typecom.foo.bar.PensionPlanBenefitTypesViewData gt     ltccinterfacegt      ltccimplementationgt         ltuiinclude srcresourcespuimarkuppensionplanbenefittypesmarkup.xhtml gt     ltccimplementationgt ltuicompositiongt codepre  pWhere the idea is, that the codejavax.faces.view.facelets.ResourceResolvercode will come to our rescue.p  pIt kind of works, but depending on the implementation we have to write for the composite components, we run into all kinds of issues in the infamous build, vs rendertime department of the JSF lifecycle. It basically does not work the way we would expect it to.p  pThe big question now isp  pstrongIs there a way in which we have both a stable contractnamespace and have multiple implementations that are dynamically resolvedstrongp  pHope someone can shed some light on this, thanks for your input.p  pKind regards,p  pRensp

Negative 2751 pIt may seem like a dumb question but when I add a maven dependecy in the gradle build file it gets resolved fine and everything works fine. However I dont get the dependency source code or javadocs even though those are available in maven repo and if i create an identical project with same deps in maven i get the source. I am using the latest version of AndroidStudio but I cant seem to find a way to make it work. This seems like a major feature and its definitely a deal braker for me if i dont find a resolution I will just keep using maven and Intellij instead, since that works fine. Have you encountered a similar issue. I google a lot but all the fixes I saw were mostly patches or advised on downloading the source jars, etc. Whats the point of downloading those manually if I were to use a dependency manager... Any ideas will be highly appreciate, I am sure that someone here faced this same issue when they moved to gradleAndroid Studio...p
Negative 2751 pFirst of all Id like to thank all of you for helping me on numerous occasions before. SO have alwasy been my goto place when faced with problems with programming.p  pThis time however, Ive been unable to find a solution to my problem...p  pIm currently developing an android app that uses two activities one main activity and a search activity.    Both of which hold a listview  the main activity has an already populated and fully functional listview and, the search activity has a populated one which seems to lack functionallity.p  pThe listview is created in a custom adapter and contains an image button toggling with a selector and four textviews.p  pMy problem is that when I toggle the image button in my search activity and then press back to get back to the main activity and finally go back to the search results, the image button is unchecked.    Since the image button is a CRUCIAL point in both the design and the following functionallity, Id really appriciate any kind of help.p  precode    package com.example.geostocks  import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.List import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException  import org.json.JSONArray import org.json.JSONException  import com.example.geostocks.R  import android.app.Activity import android.app.SearchManager import android.content.Context import android.os.AsyncTask import android.os.Bundle import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuInflater import android.view.MenuItem import android.widget.ListView import android.widget.SearchView   MainActivity.   Made by Joakim Bajoul Kakaei 8811290298   Description Creates and sets up the MainActivity programmatically.                 It is mainly associated with activitymain.xml, but uses the                listviewlayout.xml in connection to it.                   The idea was to keep the class as clean as possible and use                 multiple classes to help making coding and efficiency more easier.   public class MainActivity extends Activity       public Menu m  Variable to store a menuitem as a public variable.

I keep my SDK always updated so I frequently Run the SDK manager and download all the updates. recently I noticed that if I create a new android app project it is not creating a default MainActivity even if I check that box, it does not create a Activity under src and more to annoy me, I wasnt able to refactor anything, so I realized that I had to update my Eclipse as after reading few posts, but now when I create every new project it creates an annoying appcompatv7 project with EVERY  project, say I create two new projects it creates appcompatv72....this is driving me crazy and the new project library is the appcompatv7 project. This is becoming annoying and no idea whats going on here  What should I do...please rescue me  Thanks in advance ....A screenshot to annoy u guys too ...  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsOPZq.png altToday is not my dayp  pCurrent Alternative, not a solutionp  pstrongAs of 1252014 with ADT 23.0.2 I dont see this issue anymore.strongp  pI have waited for an acceptable solution on this issue as of now there is none, but one of the SO members directed me to this post a hrefhttpscode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid66975 relnofollowhttpscode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid66975a. What I am doing is described in one of the solutions below, but for people who have come to this post, the alternative is to delete that ugly projectif you have more than one which has been created and add up this oneappcompatv7 as a library. So if you create another project and appcomatv72...comes up delete that and point your project to the appcompatv7, do the same for other projects too. This is not recommended for some reason though, but it worked well for me till now without issues. If anyone hits up with a solution please post it here. Current Alternative, not a solutionp

In the following paragraph, it mentions details about which functions are called to invoke the constructor, which I can see in my callstack.p  pThe CC runtime library code performs the DLL startup sequence, eliminating the need to link with a separate module as was necessary in Windows 3.x. Included in the CC runtime library code is the DLL entrypoint function called DllMainCRTStartup. The DllMainCRTStartup function does several things, including calling CRTINIT, which initializes the CC runtime library and invokes C constructors on static, nonlocal variables. Without this function, the runtime library would be left in an uninitialized state. CRTINIT is available for both a statically linked CRT or linking to the CRT DLL Msvcr90.dll, from a user DLL.p  pI found one post here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions75701whathappenstoglobalvariablesdeclaredinadllWhat happens to global variables declared in a DLLa, but this just seems to state that destructors will be called.p  pAny ideas as to why the destructors are not called would be appreciated.p  pThanks, John Lawriep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI have looked at this and have read up about DLLs but still dont have the solution.  The DLL is linked implicitly with declspecdllexport.  As far as I understand, there is nothing special that I should need to do to unload the DLL.

Negative 2751 pIm just starting out with MonoMac in Xamarin Studio, and Ive run into the strangest problemp  pI a window with an NSButton and a NSTextField on it.  By this point Ive cut out the event handler on the button, so it doesnt DO anything, except highlight when I click it.  The button creation code looks like thisp  precodensButton  new NSButtonnew System.Drawing.RectangleF0, 0, 100, 100 nsButton.BezelStyle  NSBezelStyle.RoundRect nsButton.Font  NSFont.SystemFontOfSize     NSFont.SystemFontSizeForControlSizeNSControlSize.Regular nsButton.StringValue  text codepre  p...and then it gets added to the window like sop  precodensView.AddSubviewcontrol.Handle as NSView codepre  pbecause in this part of the code, control.Handle is typed as object, and nsView is the main view on the window.p  pAll runs and works fine at first.  But, if I click repeatedly on that button, eventually the window just closes.  No error, no exception, and the app itself doesnt quit menus continue to respond and cheerfully log messages when I use them.  But the window is simply  gone.p  pIts extremely repeatable it happens after 21 clicks.  If I add an event handler that updates the NSTextField e.g. hello.CaptionFoo, then it happens after 19 clicks.  It doesnt matter whether I click fast or slow its always the same number of clicks.  Note that there is no code in the project to close the window, and the window doesnt even have a close box I know of no legitimate way to close it short of quitting the app.p  pI am baffled here, and dont know how to debug this further.  Does Xamarin have some sort of evaluation limit that closes your windows after somany events  Is it a framework bug  Any insight will be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 2751 pIve found an number of posts here on Stack Overflow and mailing lists documenting the MySQL JDBC issue with timezones, datetimes, etc. But even with all that I still cant figure this out. Im using a connection string like the followingp  precode jdbcmysqllocalhost3306BigSenseuseLegacyDatetimeCodefalseampserverTimezoneUTC codepre  pI insert the date using the followingp  precode stmt.setTimestampx, s, Calendar.getInstanceTimeZone.getTimeZoneUTC codepre  pAnd the date does correctly get stored in MySQL in a DateTime column in UTC time. I can do a SELECT from the console and see it in the time format I sent it to the server as. The trouble is when I do a SELECT within JavaJDBC, it converts it to my local timezone for some reason I use Scala code like the followingp  precode        usingstmt.getResultSet        ret gt         if ret  null             val meta  ret.getMetaData            var retbuf  new ListBuffer[Map[String, Any]]           while ret.next              val rMap  scala.collection.mutable.Map[String, Any]              for i lt 1 to meta.getColumnCount                rMap  meta.getColumnLabeli gt ret.getObjecti              codepre  pIts old Scala code, so dont judge me. I realize I shouldnt be using a retval and there are more Scala ways to write this p  pAnyway, Ive tried variation where I check to see if its specifically the time column and use getTimestamp instead, both with and without the Calendar object option and I still get the time translated to local p  pThis is for the BigSense project where Im trying to support multiple databases currently have Postgres and MS SQL fully supported and so Im trying to keep the code as genericagnostic as possible. The full source for my DB stuff can be found herep  precodehttpsgithub.comsumdogBigSenseblobmastersrcmainscalaiobigsensedbDataHandlerTrait.scala codepre  pOh and Ive also tried the followingp  precode noTimezoneConversionForTimeTypetrue codepre  pand still get the same result. My local machine is setup as NZST, so it complains if I leave out the the serverTimezoneUTC from the JDBC URL. Inserts are working fine, it the SELECT that are coming back converted when they shouldnt. p
Negative 2751 pHi i would like to know how to return an array from my methods getDoubleArray and getIntArray. Heres the question my teacher is asking p  pWrite a java program that contains the following methods p  pcodeprintMenucode offers the user the following options p  ol licreate double arrayli licreate integer array, li liexit. li ol  pIt returns the users selection as an integer. The menu should loop until a  valid selection is made. p  pcodegetDoubleArraycode asks the user to choose how long their array will be. It should then  prompt himher to initialize their array. It should return the initialized array. p  pcodegetIntArraycode functions exactly as codegetDoubleArraycode except that it creates and returns an  integer array. p  pThe main method calls printMenu, and, based on the users selection, it calls one of the  other two methods. p  pIf codegetDoubleArraycode is called, the main method should then find the  quotient of the first and last elements in the array. p  pIf codegetIntArraycode is called, the main method should find the product of the first and last elements in the array. p  pThe program should loop until exit is selected. p  pYes it might seem easy to you guys but ask you can tell i am new to this.

Negative 2751 pIm having some issues with maven and its while testing. Yesterday I had working configuration and I was able to execute all of my unit tests. Then I added some classes and stated some changes but without touching config files and then after trying to run the tests again, all of them ended with codeFailed to load ApplicationContextcode. I checked the config files out to the last commit, where they worked for sure, but had the same issue. I fixed it after cloning the whole project and stepbystep adding the changes, no idea what was the difference. Today the same thing happened but after pulling colleagues changes, which were irrelevant to the config files. Any suggestionsp

Negative 2751 pI recently started to automate a report at work using Python. Since my data was provided to me in the form of an excel sheet, I felt the best way to do this was to use an excel python module. My module of choice was a hrefhttppythonhosted.orgopenpyxl relnofollowopenpyxla. It worked great, Ive used it to perform calculations and organise my data ready to plot charts. Now heres the problem...p  pI know that you cannot update existing charts using openpyxl so that option went out the window.p  pWhat I then tried to do was link the data in my openpyxl spreadsheet to another spreadsheet containing the charts which is then linked to my word document where the charts are to be displayed. So after doing this I ran my script and to my annoyance, the data links between my openpyxl spreadsheet and charts spreadsheet had been severed. I guess this is because openpyxl creates a new spreadsheet when you save using the save function links are severed.p  pMy question is.. are there any ways to maintain the data linksp

Negative 2751 pIm currently working on a cloud project. Its hosted on Amazon AWS and the data is stored in RDS MySQL. I have many devices with many small requests, devices are asking the server for new commands to execute. The devices have some parameters like power1 or 0, etc., so the commands are used to give the devices order what to do. Now there are two scenariosp  ol lipEvery command is a column in the table commands, the devices are asking and the server searches for commands with deviceID. the classic style. Gives back the column and deletes it 2 Queries.pli lipThere is a table called parameters, where all the power, ... status things are placed , every line has a timestamp and the device too. So every request the server says ok, the timestamp of the device is xxx, so which parameter was updated after this xxx.pli ol  pThe description is a bit complicated. Sorry for that. The point is In the first idea there are not as many columns as in the second. But in the second the server has to check every cloumn for WHERE deviceID AND timestampx  devicetimestamp. Every device asks every 5 seconds and there will be a lot of devices, so its a question about performance.p  pThanks folksp

Negative 2751 pWhile developing the mobile navigation menu for a site I am redesigning, I discovered that a number of mobile browsers trigger the CSS hover event through a tap, including Chrome, FlashFox, and the default browser on Android 4.x, as well as Safari on iOS 7. Is this behavior wide spread enough to rely on Im assuming issues might arise with Android 2.x phones.p  pIm wondering if anyones had any experience with this and if this behavior is safe to rely on for my navigation menu. Also is there any kind of spec that defines this behavior, or did it just kind of appear From what Ive seen it appears to perform pretty uniformly across devices.p  pIve done mobile navigation menus before with JavaScript, but this would be a nice alternative.p  pI know there are a couple questions that deal with this topic on stackoverflow, but they are pretty old, and I couldnt find any question dealing specifically with what I wanted to know.p  pEDIT To clarify, the site is being developed with responsive design, and Im not simply trying to use the desktop style navigation bar with hover. The menu is formatted for mobile, and the hover would replace the need to write JavaScript to reveal submenus when a menu option is tapped.p

This script is a part from a wp plugin, but where it fails there is no wp code. p  pwhat it does is count to an end date and print it on screen. The linep  pamount  dateFuture.getTime  dateNow.getTime5p  pis showing a negative number, so Its impossible, future date is 20141023 230000 and the current date and time in my country is 20141023 200000 cannot be lt 0 if dateFuture  dateNow. Code fails when is the actual date 20141023 but no the hour. i.e. the actual day always shows Day 0,  Hour 0, Mins 0, Secs 0. Its working properly if the day is a future day.p  pThanks a lot for your help and time in advance.p  precodefunction countdownshortcodehandler args, content  null  dateEnd  dateYmd His, strtotimenow

Negative 2751 pI have a very specific problem that I need fixing. The major issue is that I dont exactly know how to properly search the remnants of my problem on google. Therefore I am coming to StackOverflow for advice in hopes that someone will assist me.p  pstrongSummarystrongp  pSo I am writing an application which is to be PCIcompliant for the company which I am starting. The application involves IPC Interprocess communication and two watchdog apps which monitor the status of the main application. One of these watchdog applications is an updater sends an HTTP Request to the server looking for updates of the application. p  pSo This method which I am using to check the server if the application is uptodate is using the WinInet library and codeInternetOpencode to send the request. Then read the response of the page and use codeGetCookiecode to store the response in a buffer. It shall then parse the response accordingly. p  pIf the response says that the current version of my application is less than the version located on the server. It will then tell the customer user that their application is out of date, and ask them whether or not they want to update the software. If they choose to update the software, it will perform a Download And Execute from the internet and launch the updateinstaller on the users PC.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pUnfortunately, windows is very secure when it comes to having an unauthorized application send an HTTP Request to an outgoing url, let alone download something from the server then execute it on the users PC.p  pMy conclusion to this issue was to add the watchdog programs to the Task Scheduler. That way after the main application is run, it will spawn the watchdog programs and check if they are running with NTAUTHORITY privileges which are granted by the Task Scheduler. p  pAfter implementing the code to create the task and point it to the location of the watchdog programs, naming it, writing a description and everything. I executed the program. It ran without errors though here the REAL PROBLEMp  p1 Programs executesp  p2 Spawns watchdog programsp  p3 Watchdog program checks for new versionp  p4 Version is foundp  p5 Installer is downloaded, execute ... butp  p6 The installer does not appear on the screenp  hr  pWhen I run my Process Hacker application to monitor all process actions. I can see that the new installer is download amp executed. It is running as NTAUTHORITYSYSTEM just like the watchdog programs but it doesnt appear on the system.p  h2I made sure that in my code the status of the window is set to codeSWSHOWNORMALcode not codeSWHIDEcode. I also made sure that all flags are set accordingly. Though it doesnt appear on the screenh2  pWhen I run the application without adding it to the Task Scheduler as my user without NTAUTHORITYSYSTEM status and just regular user status. It executes obviously since I am already running as administrator  everything works fine. But after adding it to Task Scheduler and having it run with SYSTEM level privileges. The window doesnt appear on the screen visually. Whys thatp  pI would greatly appreciate anyone that is able to assist me with this problem. Thankyoup  pstrongedit 1strongp  pCan anyone help me understand how this user applied his fix in the registry By reading the problem I can somewhat interpret that he had the same issue as me.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8420785appisinvisibleifstartedfromtaskschedulerwithoutanyuserloggedinApp is invisible if started from Task Scheduler without any user logged inap  pIn any case, I am trying to use the advice that Gisley gave me to run the application in Interactive Mode. Possibly going to try to give that a try. Still looking for more answers but I am going to be working no this nonetheless in the meantime.p  pstrongedit 2strongp  pI tried setting the INTERACTIVE FLAG and it had no effect unfortunately.p  pAllow me to just emphasize my problemp  pFor example I write a program which has message boxes and put it in a loop.p  pfor p  pmessage boxp  pget current pidp  pmake process in the task schedulerp  pspawn new process as the task scheduler proc with NTAUTHORITYSYSTEMp  pkill last proc pidp  pend forp  pThen when I execute itp  pI get the message box. Then after new process opens with NTAUTHORITYSYSTEM the message box does not appear anymore.p  pSame for if I open a calculator for example.p  pSystemcmd.exe start c calc.exep  pProgram runs... opens calculator Program gets NTAUTHORITYSYSTEM status ON the next loop it executes the calc.exe  I see it in my task manager but it doesnt appear on the screenp  pI hope the above helped emphasize the core of my issue. I dont see the processes opened by the task scheduler process id with NTAUTHORITYSYSTEM rights... I dont see the procs executed by it on my screen, though I see them in the task manager  process hacker and they are running with NTAUTHORITYSYSTEM privileges too.p

Negative 2751 pSuppose Im writing a code to read from a file and printing its content, and Im modifying its content so often that I need it to be visible from the projects tool view. The problem is that KDevelop forces me to build the code in a separate folder i.e. build folder. So the project structure goes like this.p  precodegt Project Folder    gt code.cpp  gt file.txt  gt build       gt code exe file codepre  pNow building and executing the project wont work as expected, because codefile.txtcode is not beside the executable file, so it cant read its content.p  pMoving codefile.txtcode into build folder wont work as it will exclude it from the projects tool view in KDevelop i.e. I cant access the file from the left pane in KDevelop.p  pCreating a shortcut of file.txt and moving it into build folder so the file is besides the source code, and its shortcut is in build folder will do it, but for every time I want to rename the file, I need to create a new shortcut or rename the one in build folder.p  pWhat should I do I think it can be handled by one of two ways.p  ul lipBuilding the project in the same folder as the source code and file.txt. But KDevelop wont allow me to do so producing the error message codeThe selected build directory is not emptycode.pli lipAllowing me to add a text file to the Projects tool view without being physically inside the project folder. This way I can create the file inside the build folder, and access or modify it from the Projects tool view, but seems theres no option for this in KDevelop.pli ul  pAre there any suggestions Ive tried QtCreator and it allows me to do both.p

Negative 2751 pI am working in SQL Server 2008.  Previously, I thought empty strings i.e.,  were different than strings of just white space characters e.g.,    .  Also, I thought that white space strings of different lengths were different from each other e.g.,   vs.    .  However, it seems that SQL treats all of these the same.  That is, empty strings are the same as white space strings of any length.  Is this expectedp

I am currently using player.setVelocity as movement. What this does for me is it automatically does collision handling for walking left and right. And it works pretty well I admit. But I want someones opinion on this, I keep having a feeling there are flaws in the way I am doing it. One flaw I was thinking about is if I have a platformer type game and want to jump up through a platform but land on it when I come back down I am not sure that is possible.. Because it is doing the collision itself instead of manually doing it. Any thoughts Any input would be really appreciated, I am new to game programming and I want to be doing things the best way possible.p

Negative 2751 pAt some point flex added start conditions. Im curious to know whether this feature extends flexs theoretical ability to match tokens or if its just a pragmatic solution that tends to make the set of rules patterns and actions shorter and easier to read.p  pTheres some ambiguity here because it seems to me that start conditions could be simulated at the C level by clever use of flag variables if true, then flex without start conditions is equal in power to flex with start conditions. Lets pretend we cannot extend our scanner this way, and all the scanner can do is match tokens via the patterns and echo back the name of the tokens. In this case, can the flex scanner WITH start conditions tokenize more languages than the scanner WITHOUT start conditions Or can I always write a set of rules without start conditions that do the same thing as set of rules with start conditionsp  pDifficult question to word clearly but I hope I made it precise and clear enough.p  p.p

Negative 2751 pI was wondering what the fastest way to sort variables is I have 4 integer variables and I need to rank them quickly. This process needs to run many, many times so it needs to be quick.

Here is an example of what I am running. p  precodeA  15 B  10 C  5 D  10  def gethighestA,B,C,D     count  A     label  A     if B gt count         count  B         label  B     if C gt count         count  C         label  C     if D gt count         count  D         label  D      return count, label  highest, label  gethighestA,B,C,D if label  A     A0 if label  B     B0 if label  C     C0 if label  D     D0 secondhighest, label  gethighestA,B,C,D codepre  pI continue until I get the ranks of all the variables. I was wondering if there is a faster way to do this I would also like to implement this in cython so answers that can be accelerated when implemented in cython would be appreciated. p

Negative 2751 pI just took over a Facebook PHP project, from another programmer, and Im trying to fix some problems she encountered. The app is storing users access tokens in a DB, because we would like to access some of their user data while they are offline. p  pThe problem is, if for example Im logged in as the current user, and would like to view data of some other app user, i can only do that if i have the correct user access token for the other user. It works, until i try to use an expired access token. I am aware of the different scenarios, where the token will become expired.p  pHowever, I would like to renew the user token of another user, who is not logged in at the time. p  pIs this at all possible, or do I simply have to remove my functionality, when the specific user access token is expiredp  pExcuse my english, its been awhile since ive used it. Please let me know if you need any other information.p

titleSystem.Windows.Forms.MenuItemcodeMenuItemcodeas, one of which has several subcodeMenuItemcodes.  It also contains codeSomeLaggyControlcode, which is of course used as an example.  codeSomeLaggyControlcode takes 1 second to render and is used to emulate a bunch of controls so that the example doesnt get messy.  p  pWhenever I run the program, codeForm1codes size shrinks.  I may need to make a change to the form for it to shrink e.g. moving codesomeLaggyControl1code about, or I may not I believe this has to deal with the designer generating new code.

I am using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to solve this problem but the generated Pareto front is not smooth when I plot it in a 3D space. p  pDoes anyone have an idea why this happens Could this issue occur because of the way the problem or objectives are defined p

Negative 2751 pWe are given an arbitrary string. Now, we can perform some operations on this string. Any letter can be transformed to any other letter. Now, we can choose any letter from the string and transform it into any other letter. This would be called as one single operation.p  pHow can we convert a string into a string whose letters are in sorted order using minimum number of operations as described abovep  pAll solutions, including the emoutoftheboxem ones are welcomep  pP.S. Heres an examplep  precodeGiven string dcba We can convert this string into a sorted using at least 3 operations. The generated string can be any of the following dddd 3 operations aaaa 3 operations cccc 3 operations .. etc. codepre  pP.P.S. As asked by some people, I am providing my own solution herep  pOne of the brute force solution is to exploit recursion. When we are at a certain character index of the string, we could either not change it or change it to some other character and recursively call the function with index incremented by one. If we change the character, increment the no. of operations by 1 else just pass it as is. At each step of the recursion, we can check whether the string sorted  if yes, then update the overall minimum with current count, if its lesser than the current count.p

The chairs in each row have numbers from 1 to 100. Write a program that will calculate the length of the shortest path from the front to the back of the hall. Each chair is 1 unit wide and each row is 1 unit deep from the front of a chair to the front of the chair behind it. It is not possible to move diagonally. You may start in front of any gap in the front row and end behind any gap in the last row. You always walk through the middle of a gap. Illustrated is the shortest path through a hall, with five rows of chairs. In the illustration the hall is only 10 chairs wide instead of 100. The first number in the input will contain the number n  the number of rows. The next n lines will have two numbers, separated by a space, indicating where the gaps are. Example Input 5 3 6 2 8 4 5 7 8 3 10 p  pI think I have an efficient algorithm that I think will work, but Im not sure how to implement it into Java.p  pWhat I want to do is break up each choice into a search tree so for instance if the user input wasp  pnumber of rows 3p  pSpaces  4 7           2 9          8 11p  pMake 2 search treesp  precode              4                               7                    2           9                     2           9      8   11      8   11             8      11     8      11 codepre  pAnd then find  the path where the difference between each node is the smallest  So in this case the shortest path would be in the second tree 798 with the total distance being 5 798 So my question is then p  ol lipIs this acceptable algorithm given the problempli lipHow would I implement either this algorithm or another in java pli ol  pJuanLopes Take for instance this example 0s represent a space.p  pRow6 0 2 3 4 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow5 0 2 3 4 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow4 1 2 3 0 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow3 1 2 3 0 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow2 1 2 3 0 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow1 1 2 3 0 5 6 0 8 9p  pWhat I understand from your algorithm is that it looks at each row individually. So through rows 14 the distance between each space to the next row is equal but when you get to row 5 if you went down the path where all the 4s were missing it would take you longer compared to going down the path with all the 7s missing, does your solution take that into account  p
Negative 2751 pI know that codestrlencode counts the number of characters up until and excluding the null character code0code or code0code and that codesizeofcode gives the amount of space needed to store the string including the null character, but am confused with the output of my code.p  h3Questionh3  pI expect the result of codestrlencode to be consistently 1 less than the result of codesizeofcode because my strings are nullterminated, but it only seems to be the case for the string of length 4 and 8, excluding 0 i.e. the 3rd and 5th results below.

Negative 2751 pThe server code I have works fine as long as only one request is being sent at a time. The data flows like this The client does something, like click a button, and data is sent to the server. A header of type codeuint16tcode is prepended to this data so that the server knows how many bytes out of the bytes available to read for this one request  a solution I thought would fix the problem Im having. On the server, I connect the codereadyReadcode signal from codeQTcpSocketcode to a function that reads the header like thisp  precodevoid ServergetHeader         QTcpSocket client  qobjectcastltQTcpSocket gtsender         if client             return      forever          int N  sizeofuint16t         qint64 bytes  clientgtbytesAvailable         if bytes lt N break         QByteArray buf  clientgtreadN         emit hasDatabuf, client contains the number of bytes in the stream for this request and a reference to the current client       codepre  pThe codehasDatacode signal will trigger a function that will do the same thing the codegetHeadercode function does, but will wait for codebytescode number of bytes to be available instead of codesizeofuint16tcode bytes to be available. Once it sees that the desired number of bytes are available, it reads that many bytes from the stream and stores them in a codechar[]code, then sends it to a function which makes sense of the data where the problem occurs like thisp  precodevoid ServerhandleConnectionstdstring serverReceiveBuf, QTcpSocket client     receivedData data a struct that organizes the data to be easily readable by a human     QString stringBuilder     try         data.activityID  serverReceiveBuf.at0         data.stringCount  serverReceiveBuf.at1         int i,             j  2, placeholder for next slot to be used in the receive buffer             k  0         for i  0 i lt data.stringCount i while there are strings whose lengths we need to document             data.stringLength.inserti, serverReceiveBuf.at2i             j                  whilek lt data.stringCount while there are strings in the buffer to be put into the data structure             i  0             whilei lt data.stringLength.atk while there are characters in the buffer to be built into a string                 stringBuilder.appendserverReceiveBuf.atj                 j                 i                          we have assembled a string from chars in the buffer             now we put them into the struct             data.stringData ltlt stringBuilder             stringBuilder   empty string builder for next string.             k                   catchstdexception e         qDebug ltlt [ ltlt currentTime ltlt ]  ltlt An undefined buffer error occurred.

If I take it out, the server will crash as soon as I try to access data that should be in codeserverReceiveBufcode  the string of characters read from the stream of available bytes  because its empty. With the trycatch block, any requests sent while one was still processing are just ignored and the error message is display on the server console.p  pNow heres the frustrating part When I try to step through the code with the debugger, it works. Presumably because the request is finished processing by the time the debugger goes back to handle the second request. I thought the requests were supposed to be queued up, but apparently not. Is there something special I have to do to force queuing of data so that I can ensure that the current request is processed before trying to handle the next onep

Negative 2751 pstrongSummarystrongp  pWe run into the following situation with our Ember app and are struggling to find an appropriate solution.p  pWe are dealing with a lot of data and hence some of our requests for data are rather slow.p  pInitially we used Em.RSVP.hash to bundle our requests in the model hook of each route. However this would lock up the UI and was ultimately not acceptable.p  pOur solution was to cascade the requests in the setupController hook like sop  precodesetupController controller, modelgt     slowRequest1WhichReturnsAPromise.then datagt          Do something with request 1 data          slowRequest2WhichReturnsAPromise.then datagt              Do something with request 2 data              slowRequest3WhichReturnsAPromise.then datagt                  Do something with request 3 data codepre  pThis works. We get instant page load and can show the most relevant data first.p  pWe try to keep Ember up to date 1.11.3 at the time of writing. We are strongnotstrong using Ember Data.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pThe problem is that the UI is unlocked. The user can, for example, logout and be redirected to the login page. The requests persist and eventually complete, messing up the csrf token which we set on login and logout. The next time the user tries to login they get a 422 error.p  pAn even simpler scenario is changing a filter setting before the long running requests finish. New requests often reduced in scope by the filter change finish before the initial requests. Data then gets overwritten by the eventually finishing original requests.p  pOur immediate solution was to try and kill the pending promise but cannot find a modern way to do it.p  pThis worksp  precodeallPromises []  setupController controller, modelgt     deferredRequest1  new Em.RSVP.defer       Store all promises     getallPromises.pushObjectdeferredRequest1       Fire off request 1      Spark up the next stage when request 1 finishes     deferredRequest1.promise.then gt         deferredRequest2  new Em.RSVP.defer         getallPromises.pushObjectdeferredRequest2   ...  actions     signOut gt         getallPromises.forEach promisegt             promise.rejectcanceled codepre  pThe above is a bit ugly and simplified to get the point accross.p  pEmber Docs state that New code should use the RSVP.Promise constructor instead of defer.

E.g. if I use this menu layoutp  precodeltmenu xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroidgt     ltgroup androidididgroup1             androidcheckableBehaviorsinglegt         ltitem             androidididnavscreen1             androidicondrawableiclistblack24dp             androidtitleScreen 1 gt         ltitem             androidididnavscreen2             androidicondrawableicsearchblack24dp             androidtitleScreen2gt         ltitem             androidididnavscreen3             androidicondrawableicequalizerblack24dp             androidtitleScreen 3gt     ltgroupgt     ltgroup  androidididgroup2gt         ltitem             androidididnavsettings             androidicondrawableicsettingsblack24dp             androidtitleSettingsgt     ltgroupgt ltmenugt codepre  pThe problem is that I want to add a single custom view to the layout which has an codeandroid.support.v7.widget.SwitchCompatcode like in the Google Play Movies app see screenshot below. Ideally Id like to add the custom view while still making use of my Menu layout, but if thats not possible without using a crude hack like tapping into an existing layout generated by the support library then Id like to know the solution with the least amount of code, and which still makes it worth transitioning to codeNavigationViewcode.p  pI tried using the codeactionLayoutcode attribute to specify a custom layout file like thisp  precodeltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidorientationhorizontal androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt     ltandroid.support.v7.widget.SwitchCompat         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightmatchparent         androidtextstringnightmodegt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pHowever that attribute appeared to be ignored as it didnt work.p  pFor reference, here is a screenshot of the navigation drawer from Google Play Moviesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrBM4H.png altGoogle Play Moviesp  pThe gmail app also has custom views to show the number of counts corresponding to labels.p

Negative 2751 pInside my Rails 4 application I need to make API calls to a webservice where I can ask for an instance of stock quotes.

At application start I start a thread in a loop which is supposed to look at the queue and since I am allowed to make concurrent requests Id like to make 4 requests in parallel.p  pI get stuck in several ways. First of all I need to take into consideration that I can get multiple requests of 12000 stocks at a time since different users can trigger the same request.p  pSecond, I ll use the Thin web server wjich is multithreaded. So I guess I have to use a Mutex.p  pHow can this be achievedp

Negative 2751 pIm researching about uninstallers and I was wondering if there was some sort of a queue to delete programsfiles under Windows. Since you cant delete the running uninstaller, there has to be a way to either put the program somewhere that will delete it when possible or call another process to delete the said program.

Negative 2751 pBefore publishing my work over the internet, I am here to ask you a debrief if what I built is sufficiently secure as accepted practice.p  pMy client query a db by ID of items then it passes the ID over the url to a second page. So you will have something likep  precode mypage.compagenameqnumericID codepre  pThe codenumericIDcode is the ID of an item.  I wonder if the site is secure enough against crawling if the API are allowed under the same domain only, or if I should follow another practice more orthodox cookies refactor the app as single page instead of twopages  first for query, second for results ...p  pPlease advice also how to reframe my question, cause security about servers is completely a new thing to me and I dont know exactly what topic I should look at.p
