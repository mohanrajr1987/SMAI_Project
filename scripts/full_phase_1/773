Positive 773 pI have been trying to generate a sitemap for my website which is based on angular. I have tried the automatic sitemap generators but they are unable to crawl through my website since apart from the homepage the routing is handled by angular instead of server. I tried using grunt as well but its not working as expected, of all the grunt modules available we just define the site root and a source folder, it crawls through the source folder appending each html to the site root with the relative path but since the routes have been created using the routeprovider from angular, the links generated from using grunt fairly becomes unusable. So is there any way of generating site map apart from manually generating itp

There are also rewrite rules, which are more like redirects.p  pI guess my best bet to deliver different blog posts would be to pass a query string to codeblogpost.htmlcode mywebsite.comblogpost.htmlpostpostalias and have the code.jscode ask the API different content depending on the query string.p  pIs there a way using S3 to route codemywebsite.comblogpostaliascode to codemywebsite.comblogpost.htmlpostpostaliascode and pass the response to the client without redirecting Im both interested in clientside url rewriting via JS to have nice URLs for humans AND serverside routing to catch crawler requests and have SEOindexing of pages for specific posts, for example.p  pHow should I go about this Is there a way to achieve all this using what S3 and JS provide or do I have to put a proxyrouter like nginx in front of S3 to handle route requestsp  pWe are really committed to the whole S3ApiGatewayLambdaDynamo architecture and we would really love to do without server.p

Negative 773 pI am writing a text renderer for an OpenGL application.  Size, colour, font face, and antialiasing can be twiddled at run time and so multiple font faces can appear on the screen at once.  There are too many combinations to allocate one texture to each combination of string and attributes.  However, only a small subset of the entire database of strings will be on the screen at any given time.p  pThis leads me into the opportunity to create a cache for the strings that are being printed frame after frame.  It has been mandated that I use only one texture for the entire operation, as creating a cache of many textures would incur a texture swapping penalty for every different string printed from the cache.p  pSo I have before me a 2048x2048 texture, into which I can place whatever strings I can fit as they are being requested by the application for caching purposes.  I have quickly realized that tracking the free space available in a two dimensional space is not trivial.p  pI have been looking at things like Best Fit and Next fit, but those seem to be suitable for 1d spaces.p  pHow can I manage this cache texture in OpenGLp  pEdit I have since learned that this is an instance of a 2d packing problem.p

Negative 773 pImagine you work for a small lean software company. You know the future competitiveness of the company is in having a good reusable code base to draw upon. Its going to be very important to manage the companys reuse policy to ensure you deliver today, at the same time as providing a backbone for the future.p  pIn my mind there are two reasons to write reusable code in business 1 To share within the company to improve speed and efficiency in the future 2 To publish on the web and other people will help improve the code crowdsourcing in a sense.p  pDevelopers should always apply common sense to reuse of course. But to get a handle on this from a management perspective I want some overall codereuse guidelines to ensure we are competitive now and in the future. These guidelines should encourage the developer to ask Is my code a Candidate for Reuse. strongWhat should these guidelines saystrongp  pMy initial thoughts Its not worth writing reusable code at the lowest levels e.g. I have some inline code which adds a s to the end of a string, there would be far too much of this code to even sift through and find that someone has already done it. Its also not worth writing reusable code at the topmost level i.e. the application because your customer reporting application would end up being genericised into a SQL client  useless to most users.p  pMain barriers to reusable code You cant reuse it unless you know it exists Trust  Its been done but do you trust it Initial time taken to make the code genericreusable and to document it.p

Negative 773 pSimple situation. An existing project will need authentication and authorization and I need to design it. First of all, I choose to divide the whole thing into two modules, one for authentication and the other for authorization. Both will be seen as blackboxes for the project. For now, the authentication module will just use the Windows account of the user, link this to an unique GUID and offer this GUID to other modules as the user ID. Newer versions of this module will do more magic but for now, this will be enough.p  pThe authorization module will be a bit more complex. It will use the GUID and link it to the access rights of the user. With the GUID, it could communicate with the authentication module and request more user information.p  pBut next to roles, should the authorization module also manage some other user data, or would it be better to add them to the authentication module Think about name, address, phone, office name, gender and how they like their coffee...p  pBasically, the authentication module will contain an interface and customers who like to use our software can use out default authentication module or use the interface to develop their own version. So I dont want it to keep too much information.p  pAnd would I need more information in the authentication module than just the rolesp

Negative 773 pIm developing a Java EE 6 application where providers should be able to define a price and different discounts on a service for users. There are many different providers. Each one provides the same service, the pricing models can be different.p  pPrice Model  A provider should be able to define the price e.g. per hour, per minute, per process, ... .   The provider should be able to easily add conditions to define the discount a user gets. For example users from a specific usergroup get a discount of 10 and users who used the service more than 5 times get another discount.   It shoulld be able to link conditions with logical operations like AND or OR.  The amount of possible conditions should be defined by the software manufacturer.p  ul liWhen a user tries to access the service the userspecific price should be shown. After using the service the particular user gets sometime an invoice where the total cost of this service is listed. While using the service the provider can change the pricing model, so there must be a version number or something. The pricing model versions should then be saved in a database.li ul  pThe Question is  Is it possible and meaningful to use a rule engine to solve this specification  Provider should define conditions without xml files or something like that, just by clicking and choosing. I have no experience with rule engines... so maybe someone can help me to figure out which solution is best for the problem.p

It only needs a toolbar, a tab bar, a split panel preferably 3 columns, an easilyformatable text field, and a status bar. It will connect to a MySQL database through PHP unless I go for GWT. Users will upload files.p  pMy evaluation of the optionsp  pstrongFlexstrong Probably the easiest to develop but Im pretty sure my application is something one would use on an iPad and with Flashs future on the iPad still unsure, I dont want to take the risk, otherwise Flex wouldve been my choice.p  pstrongjQuerystrong Ive heard a lot about it and a lot of people recommend but I dont know how easy it is to use and how customizable the look of my app is.p  pstrongGWTstrong The problem with GWT is that it doesnt have many widgets. Another problem is that Im gonna have to host the files in AppEngines datastore and transfer them back and forth to a web server that will do operations on them I need to process them which adds more traffic and slows the process which worsens the user experience.p  pstrongClosurestrong It has a nice toolbar and a nice text field.

Negative 773 pNot sure if the question wording is accurate, but heres what I want to do I want to databind a class with some strings in itp  precodeclass MyClass      public string MyProperty  get set      public string MyProperty2  get set   codepre  pWhen databinding, everything behaves normally. On the back end, Im writing to a file and I want MyProperty2 to always be encrypted using some encryption algorithm. I want my backend code to write each string without needing to know that encryption is required I want the class to know it should be encrypted, not the consumer. Can I do this with a type converter, or something similarp  pEDIT There are other scenarios as well. Some booleans I want to format as Y or N, other booleans I want formatted as Enabled  Disabled, etc. I can write and have written helper methods and let the file writer call the helper methods as appropriate, Im just wondering if theres a way to do this without the file writer needing to know which objects need which kind of formatting and let the objects tell that to the file writer.p
Negative 773 pIm looking for a way to do asynchronous and threadsafe logging in my C project, if possible to one file. Im currently using codecerrcode and codeclogcode for the task, but since they are synchronous, execution shortly pauses every time something is logged. Its a relatively graphicsheavy app, so this kind of thing is quite annoying.p  pThe new logger should use asynchronous IO to get rid of these pauses. Threadsafety would also be desirable as I intend to add some basic multithreading soon.p  pI considered a onefileperthread approach, but that seemed like it would make managing the logs a nightmare. Any suggestionsp
Negative 773 pLead in ... Im not an expert, by far, in application security via SSL, but am trying to establish a test environment that includes all possible scenarios we may encounter in production. For this I have a tree of Certificate Authorities CAs that are the issuers of an assortment of test client certificates, and nodeserver certificates complex test environment representing the various published web services and other applications we integrate with.p  pThe structure of these CAs are as follows Root CA, which has signedissued Sub CA1, Sub CA2, and Sub CA3. These subs have then signedissued all certificates of those various nodes and clients in the environment.p  pNow for the question .... In my applications truststore I would like to trust everything signed by Sub CA1, and Sub CA2, but not Sub CA3 untrusted. Does this mean my truststore should 1 ONLY include Sub CA1 and Sub CA2, or 2 should it include Root CA, Sub CA1, and Sub CA2p  pI dont know what is the proper way to represent this trust chain in a truststore. In the future I would also like to add a Sub CA4 also signedissued by the Root CA, but add that to a Certificate Revocation List CRL for testing purposes.p  pAhead of time, thank you for any help concerning this. Its greatly appreciated. p

Negative 773 pI have the following setupp  pI have a largish number of uuids currently about 10k but expected to grow unboundedly  theyre user IDs and a function f  id  sparse vector with 32bit integer values no need to worry about precision. The function is reasonably expensive not outrageously so, but probably on the order of a few 100ms for a given id.  The dimension of the sparse vectors should be assumed to be infinite, as new dimensions can appear over time, but in practice is unlikely to ever exceed about 20k and individual results of f are unlikely to have more than a few hundred nonzero values. p  pI want to support the following operations efficiently p  ul liadd a new ID to the collectionli liinvalidate an existing IDli liretrieve sum fid in Ochanges since last retrievalli ul  pi.e. I want to cache the sum of the vectors in a way thats reasonable to do incrementally.p  pOne option would be to support a remove ID operation and treat invalidation as a remove followed by an add. The problem with this is that it requires us to keep track of all the old values of f, which is expensive in space. I potentially need to use many instances of this sort of cached structure, so I would like to avoid that. p  pThe likely usage pattern is that new IDs are added at a fairly continuous rate and are frequently invalidated at first. Ids which have been invalidated recently are much more likely to be invalidated again than ones which have remained valid for a long time, but in principle an old Id can still be invalidated. p  pIdeally I dont want to do this in memory or at least I want a way that lets me save the result to disk efficiently, so an idea which lets me piggyback off an existing DB implementation of some sort would be especially appreciated. p

Negative 773 pIm starting to think about and develop an architecture for a big web application, and I wanted to get suggestions andor recommendations on which technologies andor frameworks to use.p  pThe application will be an Intranetbased web site using Windows authentication, running on IIS and using ASP.NET.  Itll need to be structured as a main web application with subweb applications.  Essentially, the entire scope is a composite browserbased, Intranet application that is composed of discrete, functionally complete modules or subapplications.p  pThis composite web client application would have a main or shell module to provide the overall user interface structure.  Additionally, the shell module would provide access to common services that all the individual subapps or modules could use.  Then each subappmodule would contain its own functionality and implementation, but integrate with the shell user interface.p  pNext, based on the user and which of the subapps are available, the main or shell app would dynamically build tabs or buttons or something as a way to access each individual application.  And, well be storing the user and application data in a database table.p  pSo, for example, were going to have a reports application, a display application, and probably a couple other distinct applications.  On startup of the mainshell application, after determining who the user is, the main app will query the database to determine which subapps the user can use and build out the UI.  Then the user can navigate between available subapps and do their work in each.p  pI hope all this makes sense.p  pAnyway, Im wondering which, if any, preexisting technologiesframeworks would work best for architecting and developing a system such as this.p  pWould the Web Client Software Factory be a good choice Would some other MVP solution be a good choice Would ASP.NET MVC be a good choice Something else Would none of these be a good choice and we should just develop everything from the ground up using web forms Any other info I should know aboutp  pThanksp

Negative 773 pThis comes out of my search for a smart variant of codeNSLogcode. One key feature of codeBetterLogcode is that the codeNSLogcode replacement compiles out to nothing for release and distribution builds. The proposed solution see eg a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions300673isittruethatoneshouldnotusenslogonproductioncodehttpstackoverflow.comquestions300673isittruethatoneshouldnotusenslogonproductioncodea is define a preprocessor symbol to control the definition of codeBetterLogcode depending on the kind of build. Typicallyp  precodeifdef DEBUGMODE     define DebugLog s, ...  NSLog ltp dgt , self, [[NSString stringWithUTF8StringFILE] lastPathComponent], LINE, [NSString stringWithFormats, VAARGS]  else     define DebugLog s, ...   endif codepre  pwhere codeDEBUGMODEcode would be defined as a preprocessor symbol only for debug builds.p  pHowever, in a number of cases, namely when the logging statement was built with intermediary variables, the result is a compiler warning for unused variables. Here is an examplep  precodeif error      NSString titleString  Error downloading thumbnail, will rebuild it     NSString messageString  [error localizedDescription]     NSString moreString  [error localizedFailureReason]  [error localizedFailureReason]  NSLocalizedStringCheck the URL., nil     BetterLog . , titleString, messageString, moreString   silently ignoring this error is OK. codepre  pHere all three strings yield compiler warnings. And I hate compiler warnings.p  pOf course its impossible to avoid without somehow conditionally including the variables declarations themselves. I made the following attempt, but it didnt workp  pinstead of simply defining codeDEBUGMODEcode in debug mode only, I define it all the time, with value 1 in debug mode, and value 0 in release mode.p  pThen I tried to take advantage of the compiler dead code stripping optimization p  precodeif DEBUGMODE ampamp error       snip  codepre  pThe code is OK it is correctly stripped out in release mode. Yet the compiler still emits the unused variable warnings.p  pSo the question is isnt it possible to do any better than the uglyp  precodeif DEBUGMODE if error       snip  endif codepre

Negative 773 pAs far as I know, for using Annotations or [Attributes] in C you have to have a reference to the class metadata, so that you can ask if the class is annotated attributed or not.p  pMy question is how does JSF implementation find all classes annotated with ManagedBean Does it scan all of the classes in the class path Or is there a way to actually query the JVM for the annotated classesp  pIm asking this because when I put my annotated backing beans in my web project directly, theres no problem. But the beans that I define in the JAR files to be reusable across projects are not registered.

Negative 773 pI have a Crystal Report Im trying to recreate from scratch after an update from VS2008 to VS2010 caused it to implode horribly.p  pIve gotten most of the way through, but Im at a stage where Im linking a field in the Main Report to a corresponding field in the Subreport.p  pI have set up a bunch of Database fields in the Subreport, Ive added the table I want, TableA, Ive linked it up as everything was linked in the original report, with TableA at the head of the linking chain, so that all the rows I want can be derived from the result of that first query  strongActually, all of the links from the original Report were red in the Database Fields linking dialog, whereas mine are a bit rainbowy. All the links in TableA are red, though... strong p  pIn the Subreport Links dialog, I have an integer which I know is being pulled from the database correctly. Ive added it in the Fields to link to listbox, and selected the newlycreated parameter in the Subreport parameter to use combobox. Ive ticked the Select data in subreport based on field checkbox.p  pThe database field I want to link to then does not appear in the second combobox.p  pAnother integer field in TableA shows up fine in the Select data... combobox and is linked to another field being passed in, so I dont know why these two integer fields, which are equally important, and exist on the same level, on the same table, are being treated differently by the report designed.p  pAny ideas what Im doing wrongp  pAlternatively, direct answers to the headline question are also welcome, I just added this explanation here for context.p

Negative 773 pRun into a bit of an issue, and Im looking for the best solution concepttheory.p  pI have a system that needs to use objects. Each object that the system uses has a known interface, likely implemented as an abstract class. The interfaces are known at build time, and will not change. The exact implementation to be used will vary and I have no idea ahead of time what module will be providing it. The only guarantee is that they will provide the interface. The class name and module DLL come from a config file or may be changed programmatically.p  pNow, I have all that set up at the moment using a relatively simple system, set up something like so rewritten pseudocode, just to show the basicsp  precodestruct ClassID      Module  module     int number   class Module      HMODULE module     functionltvoid  intgt  createfunc      static Module  LoadString filename      IObject  CreateClassint number              return createfuncnumber        class ModuleManager      bool LoadModuleString filename      IObject  CreateClassString classname              ClassID class  AvailableClasses.findclassname         return class.modulegtCreateObjectclass.number           vectorltModulegt LoadedModules     mapltString, ClassIDgt AvailableClasses  codepre  pModules have a few exported functions to give the number of classes they provide and the namesIDs of those, which are then stored. All classes derive from codeIObjectcode, which has a virtual destructor, stores the source module and has some methods to get the class ID, what interface it implements and such.p  pThe only issue with this is each module has to be manually loaded somewhere listed in the config file, at the moment. I would like to avoid doing this explicitly outside of the codeModuleManagercode, inside that Im not really concerned as to how its implemented.p  pI would like to have a similar system without having to handle loading the modules, just create an object and once its all set up it magically appears.p  pI believe this is similar to what COM is intended to do, in some ways. I looked into the COM system briefly, but it appears to be overkill beyond belief. I only need the classes known within my system and dont need all the other features it handles, just implementations of interfaces coming from somewhere.p  pMy other idea is to use the registry and keep a key with all the knownregistered classes and their source modules and numbers, so I can just look them up and it will appear that codeManagerCreateClasscode finds and makes the object magically. This seems like a viable solution, but Im not sure if its optimal or if Im reinventing something.p  pSo, after all that, my question is How to handle this Is there an existing technology, if not, how best to set it up myself Are there any gotchas that I should be looking out forp

Negative 773 pI have a query that selects a table of nodes, then joins a table of titles to it. This is done by first joining an inbetween table of node IDs and title IDs that allows a manytomany relationship between the first two tables. Both joins are inner so that only nodes with a properly configured and existing title are selected. I believe this to all be clean and efficient  the problem is what followsp  pThere is also a fourth table that provides a simple hierarchy for nodes nodeparents. Each row has two fields a node ID and a node ID that acts as that nodes parent nodeid and parentid. Some nodes do not have children configured in this database ie. the node itself isnt marked as a parent in any row of the nodeparents table  these are the nodes Im trying to select.p  pThe additional criteria for these childless nodes is that they have a specific title configured  hence the subquery initially selecting from nodetitles and then inner joining nodeparents. The subquery also has a GROUP BY because some nodes are parents of multiple nodes, so their nodeid will unnecessarily appear multiple times in the results. I should also point out that because of this the primary key for nodeparents is a combination of the nodeid and parentid.p  pThe queryp  precodeSELECT  nodes.nodeid,         titles.title FROM nodes INNER JOIN nodetitles ON nodes.nodeid  nodetitles.nodeid INNER JOIN titles ON nodetitles.titleid  titles.titleid WHERE nodes.nodeid NOT IN          SELECT nodetitles.nodeid     FROM nodetitles     INNER JOIN nodeparents     ON nodetitles.nodeid  nodeparents.parentid     WHERE nodetitles.titleid  1     GROUP BY nodetitles.nodeid      AND titles.titleid  1 codepre  pTables sizes nodes  32,000 nodetitles  49,000 titles  3 nodeparents  55,000p  pThe query takes around 16 minutes to complete.

Negative 773 pI am trying to implement RungeKuttas 4th order integration method in matlab on a 2d matrix x, y.  The matrix contains a height value float at each point.

However, for RK4 integration, I need to take 4 slopes at variable points, not the predetermined slope given by the gradient.p  pI think the Matlab gradient function itself doesnt have these kind of parameters from what I understand from the Matlab docs.

Negative 773 pI finally got back to fleshing out a GitCommit message mode that I want to add to YI but I seem to missing something basic.  I cant seem to match a single character in a grammar, all my rules only work if they match the entire line.  I know this has to be possible because other grammars in YI obviously do this but doing the same thing doesnt seem to work.p  pI want to have a commit mode that eventually looks very similar to the one in vim.  One of the things thats useful in vims mode is the keyword highlighting inside comments.  Git puts a bunch of information inside comments in most everything it does commit, rebase, etc. so this is useful.  My thinking was match the starting  character in git comments and switch to a different context that will match keywords.

Negative 773 pI am working on developing a WebWorks app that uses JQuerys show and hide methods to dynamically change page contents. p  pThe application initially loads a page with a few text inputs  as well as a JQuery styled hyperlink button. Focus on the start page is defined with the xblackberryinitialFocus attribute. p  pWhen one of the hyperlink buttons is selected JQuery hides the displayed text inputs and buttons, and shows a different set of text inputs and hyperlink buttons. At this point, focus navigation breaks and it appears that no element has focus. p  pI have tried adding permissions to use blackberry.focus to my config.xml and executing  blackberry.focus.setFocusmytextinputid,  but that did not have any effect. p  pI guaranteed that the call to setFocus was executed after the desired HTML element was added to the DOM by putting the call to setFocus in the JQuery show methods callback function. I also used JQuery to select the desired text input before calling setFocus to ensure that the element was existant. p  pAdditionally, I called blackberry.focus.getFocus before and after calling setFocus , but the getFocus method returned an empty string on each call. p  pDoes anyone know why I cant seem to regain focusp

Negative 773 pHeres the problem.  We have some software, there is a free edition and a paid edition available.p  pThe software is an EXE download which sets up the software.  The way we are hoping to gain most sales are from people downloading the free edition, then deciding through various links in the software that they would like to pay for it now and unlock new features.p  pAt the moment we run several campaigns to get visitors to our site.  We know that a visitor came from say our Reddit campaign, downloaded our software and then from all intents and purposes they have vanished.  If they use the software and wish to pay, they click a link in the software and the purchase is annonymous.p  pWhat we would like to do is when they download the software, somehow it generates a text file in their install directory with the source of their download in it.  This file would contain data like reddit1 to indicate they originated from reddit campaign 1.  Then every link in the software sends that variable in a GET request so we know where the sale actually has come from.p  pWhat we cant figure out the best way to do, is when we have the variable with their source in it on the website, how to pass this to the EXE download so during install it generates the data file  We dont want to have multiple downloads for each campaign we run.p

Negative 773 pI have a stacktrace that I am stumped on, because I cannot reproduce it locally.  If I deploy the same .war of my grails app to a local instance of Tomcat 7, everything works.

Together with EntitityUtils.ToString and Jsoup, I parse each HTML result of my secured website part. On logging on, I create a sqllite table in android, in which I store only 1 simple record, the user that logged on.p  pWhen I run this on my emulator, everything runs just as Id like it to be, but on my device, something seems to go terribly wrong. I attached the debugger to my phone. The logging in seems to go just fine, and the cookies are being set. The sqllite bit probably goes fine too, as I dont seem to get errors. Upon loading the profilepage, I can see that the HTTPGetaction gets the cookies attached of the CookieStore, but the HTMLresultdoc I receive, is 95 of the times the loginpage.p  pI say 95, because I did get to my profilepage once or twice on my rooted Desire HD, but on another Desire HD I didnt, and on my Sensation XE neither. The times I did get the profilepage loaded a custom listbox with a hashmap as input, I couldnt start any action. They aborted right away, and probably they had the same issue getting loginpage as result.p  pAre there any permissions I forgot, is there anything I should check, or do you have any idea what it could be Im really confused right now.p  pstrongSmall updatestrongbr I just rebooted my phone. When I start the program, the first time I log on, my profile page gets loaded. My detail action seems to work. This action does not connect to the internet or so, it simply displays information I stored in a class. My other 2 actions copy and delete dont work I probably get the login page as a result. When I turn my screen orientation changes, the page restarts and its trying to load the profile page again. The listbox is cleared, and I dont get my profile page which is a list of adverts back.p  pstrongUpdate 2  0803strong My manifest file only contains the internetpermission, apart from the registration of my activities. A small weird extra. It seems my backup code is nearly equal to my code posted here. Each time it does seem to attach my cookies, but still it doesnt do anything with it . Also, I was playing around a bit yesterday with my phone, I changed orentiation a few times which reloads the activity automatically, and suddenly, I once or twice had my profile in front. I couldnt do any action on it, but my class containing information was accessable and filled. PS. Just now 8.15 AM my time, I again could load my profile after switching orientation 45 times.p  pstrongUpdate 08032012strong I have been puzzling and tried lots of things in the evening, and now I even got my emulatorversion back to square 1.

Roughly speaking MySQL table is just a heap of rows lying on HDD and indexes are tiny versions of these tables sorted by the index fields and pointing to the actual rows. Thats a super oversimplification of course but the point is I dont see how it is possible to fix this at all, i.e. how to use more than one index, be able to do fast GROUP BYs by the time query reaches GROUP BY index is completely useless because of range searches and other things. I know that MySQL or similar databases have various helpful things such index merges, loose index scans and so on but this is simply not adequate  the queries above will still take forever to execute.p  pI was told that the problem can be solved by NoSQL which makes use of some radically new ways of storing and dealing with data, including aggregation tasks. What I want to know is some quick schematic explanation of how it does this. I mean I just want to have a quick glimpse at it so that I could really see that it does that because at the moment I cant understand how it is possible to do that at all. I mean data is still data and has to be placed in memory and indexes are still indexes with all their limitation. If this is indeed possible, Ill then start studying NoSQL in detail.p  pPS. Please dont tell me to go and read a big book on NoSQL. Ive already done this for MySQL only to find out that it is not usable in my case  So I wanted to have some preliminary understanding of the technology before getting a big book.p  pThanksp

Negative 773 pstrongHeres the main question I guessstrongp  pIs there a .NET way to get at a request very early on either via HttpHandler or HttpModule and inject standard asp.net markup, either in the form of standard controls, or usercustom controls, and have the framework treat it like a page that it is compiling dynamicallyp  pstrongMore Backgroundstrongp  pOk, so theres this custom CMS we use that does a great job of building fairly complicated sites.  It has a nice templating system, user permissions, easy to install, etc.  However, one feature we want to add is being able to add dynamic content.p  pAfter the CMS goes out and does its thing the result is essentially a giant HTML string that gets sent back in the response.  The rendering engine is contained in a class that handles this cms stuff.  Right now this happens in a standard page lifecycle, but theres no reason it cant be called independently. p  pIve been able to get close with both a httpHandler and httpModule, but the problem is that what I really need is to take the cms html string, add in my own .net controls, emand then have the framework take that new string and build a control tree from item along with a viewstate, etc.p  pThe closest I got was with the HttpModule which during PreRequestHandlerExecute attached a filter to the Response.  This filter just looked for places to replace replaceme with a label tag markup as a proofofconcept...example below.  I thought this would work since from what I had read this was before the control tree was created, but all that happened was the asp.net markup was written to the page not rendered by .NET.p  pAnother thing Ive tried is to take complete control via an HttpHandler.  This emalmost workedem as well also an example below...the problem here is that while I can build my own control tree, and even execute an ascx control, there is no place to merge all of these things together remember I already have an entire html document string, Im trying to merge it at runtime and pass it to .NET.p  pI feel like Im very close but missing some very easy way to pass most of this work off to .NET...p  pstrongHttpmodulestrongp  precode    private void PreRequestHandlerExecuteObject source, EventArgs e              HttpApplication application  HttpApplicationsource         HttpContext context  application.Context          context.Response.Filter  new PageFiltercontext.Response.Filter      codepre  pstrongFilter From a SO example I thinkstrongp  precode    public override void Writebyte[] buffer, int offset, int count              string strBuffer  System.Text.UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetStringbuffer, offset, count                     Wait for the closing lthtmlgt tag                   Regex eof  new Regexlthtmlgt, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase          if eof.IsMatchstrBuffer                      responseHtml.AppendstrBuffer                  else                      responseHtml.AppendstrBuffer             string finalHtml  responseHtml.ToString              finalHtml  finalHtml.Replacereplaceme, ltaspLabel idlblMyTest runatserver TextThis is a label that was replaced by my responsefilter gt               Transform the response and write it back out              byte[] data  System.Text.UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetBytesfinalHtml              responseStream.Writedata, 0, data.Length               codepre  pstrongThe Test HttpHandlerstrongp  precode    public void ProcessRequestHttpContext context               MyBasePage page  new MyBasePage         Test tpage  TestBuildManager.CreateInstanceFromVirtualPathTest.ascx, typeofTest          var htmlform  new System.Web.UI.HtmlControls.HtmlForm         var panel  new Panel          panel.Controls.Addnew Label  Text  Hello World          panel.Controls.Addtpage          htmlform.Controls.Addpanel         page.Controls.Addhtmlform         page.ProcessRequestcontext      codepre

Negative 773 pI get a large list of data to populate into a jqGrid on my clientside.p  precodeListltMyDatagt lotsOfRecords  getData codepre  pWhich I then store in cache, since a lot of people will be using itp  precodeCache[SharedData].AddlotsOfRecords codepre  pThis grid allows users to check records for processing. I want to persist which records are checked as a user sorts, filters, pages, etc.p  pMy first thought was to add a property codebool Selected  get set code to the codeMyDatacode object, and toggle it whenever someone checks a field. Obviously, that wont work since this is a shared cache. I dont want Joe User checking things that Bill User didnt want checked.p  pNext idea was to store a codeDictionaryltint, boolgtcode in session, that maps the id of a record to the checked status. This wasnt bad, but since there is no easy way to combine objects in .NET, I dont see a clean way to send that down to my grid without a clunky anonymous objectp  precodereturn lotsOfRecords.Selectrecord gt       record.Id,      record.Name,      ...      myDictionary[record.Id]  truefalse for checked  codepre  pThat would be a solution, but Im hoping there is a cleaner design pattern considering I have a lot of fields in my object and use it in a similar way across a few pages. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks in advancep  pBtw, my current environment is ASP.NET MVC 3 with jQueryUI and jqGrid. p

Negative 773 pPlease change the title if you want...p  pI use a hrefhttpsgithub.comcloudheadtoto relnofollowtotoa as a blog engine for my website. So it uses Rack, Heroku and all the settings can be put nicely in the file codeconfig.rucode, which is why I like it since it makes everything simple for me. p  pI use a Rack plugin a hrefhttpsgithub.comtalisonrackmobiledetect relnofollowmobile detecta to detect mobile devices and then redirect to a different site.p  pAnd thats where the problem comes. I tested the redirect request, for some time after the deployment, the redirect only works after I refresh the page, which means, I type in the URL for my website on an iPhone, first try will give me the original site, not the one for mobile, after I hit refresh it gets redirected.p  pI think its because of the caching on the server because even if I clear all cache on my phone, it still happens. So this leads to my question what Rack functionplugin would let me automatically clear the cache on the server OR force the browser to refresh when a mobile is detected. p  pI have googled for this solution many times and most of it is for Rails app which is not really for me. How do I just make it work all in the codeconfig.rucode  p

Negative 773 pJames here. Quick, and simple question for you guys. Im working with a tumblr theme which uses a text option, which means the user can type whatever they want, and itll display on the blog. The text options however do not work with javascript, so I cant use the text option for amount of columns and the text option for spacing between posts in my script that organizes the whole page. I know there is a way, but I dont know how to do this, to just create an invisible div with the boo lean text in it, and then use jQuery to get the text inside the div to use as a variable I was thinking like .text or .html but I have no clue. Any codes or help would be greatly appreciated. Im new at this jquery thing, so itd mean a lot.p  pEDIT If this is confusing for anyone, I basically need to use jQuery to get text inside an invisible element and use that text as a variable.p

Negative 773 pI have two sites Im developing in PHP. They are using identical code to provide an XLS export using PEAR excel and they are running on the same local server. To rule out a problem with the actual data in the xls, I am just outputting a file with no data for now.p  pWhen I export from site A and save the file its reported as ANSI encoded within Notepad. This file opens correctly in Excel.p  pWhen I export from site B, the file is reported as UTF8 encoded, the file wont open in Excel. If I convert the file to ANSI or UTF8 without BOM in Textpad, it opens just fine in Excel.p  pThe same encoding difference is present between site A and B when I save an arbitrary page on the site, so I think it may be more fundamental than just how the Excel file is being generated same encoding when exporting CSVODS formats. Ive compared the http headers between site A and B during the export, they are functionally identical. Explicitly adding CharsetISO88591 to the header makes no difference. The apache virtual hosts are also functionally identical between sites. Both sites are using identical character encodings in their databases but since Im not exporting any data right now, this is irrelevant.p  pWhat else could be causing this which I havent accounted forp  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe excel generation is a red herring, Ive removed all of that and simply outputting the download header and a test string. When saved, the file is still encoded differently between sites. The code which generates the download file seems identical when I diff the various files... p  pI havent been able to repeat the problem by creating a simplified test case. When I tried, both sites output files which are saved as ANSI  I dont understand what else could be going on.p

Negative 773 pIm simultaneously teaching myself about Delphis database architecture and [MSAccess] SQL. I understand how to hook together Tables and DBGrids, enjoying how changes in a grid are automagically edited, inserted, appended, updated, posted, etc. to the underlying table.p  pI also understand how I can open or execute an [ADO]Query and view the resulting data in a grid.p  pWhat Im much foggier about changing Tables by editing a DBGrid displaying query results. In my online searches, it seems like all the examples Ive found where query results are edited involve queries no more complex than SELECT ... FROM oneTable. It seems like DBGrids are for working only with individual tables or displaying query results. p  pOn my own, when Ive tried working with query results involving two or more tables I always get an error of some sort insufficient key column info, a missing parameter, or other messages. I feel like Im missing something fundamental, or DBGrids are rarely used for editing anything other than individual tables. Do you have any suggestions where I might look to learn what Im missing The most commonly suggested links like the db lessons at delphi.about.com dont address the issue.p  pEDIT Remous response helps me a lot in explaining problems Ive been having. So Ill edit my question slightly by generalizing beyond only MSAccess dbs. Can complex queries be updated via DBGrids in other popular databasesp

Negative 773 pI need some text data street names of a 2 million town to get into my android application. I think the best way to do this is to store it into a sqlite database readonly when it starts the first time. As I read, doing this with a predefined database is pretty tedious and not clean but you have to copy it from external storage or something and have the data twice then. So I thought about using a csv file from raw resources and delete it after import, but this is not possible too because this data will be built into the sdk file and cant be deleted anymore.br My target is it to make some kind of initial data transfer from local and delete this data source. Any ideas how to achieve that properly Id like to go without downloading the data from a server because this would mean that the only reason my application needs an internet connection is because of downloading the initial data. Otherwise it wouldnt need an internet connection. p

Negative 773 pI have a Delphi 6 program that for most users installs fine while running under a user account without admin privileges.  However, on some systems it triggers a request for admin rights.  Unfortunately mine isnt one of them so its hard for me to diagnose this problem.  I use InnoSetup 5.1.9 to build my install programs.  p  pHow can I figure out what I need to change about my installation programs configuration to neutralize the need for admin rights on some peoples systems  Its causing trouble for my system because during installation, certain program data files are being copied into the emadminem accounts application data folder.  Then when my program is launched under a emuserem account, those files can not be found since they are not in the emuserem account application folder, where they are expected to be.p
Negative 773 pI am seeing a strange issue with a multi pass, multi RT pingpong renderp  pI am using 3 shaders and an FBO, I get no errors at any stage. I am using opengl 4, so I am not using glBeginglEnd, I use my own matrices for transformation and i am using vertex buffers for renderingp  pThe general idea of this test is to render 3 different colours to three separate fbo attachments I realise that it is not efficient rendering the vbo twice in the first pass but this is just to help me understand a problem in some other source I then bind a separate set of textures to the fbo and use the first set as the samplers. The final pass is to blend the results into the back bufferp  pWhat is odd is that the output is both quads appear red, when the first should be red and the second green as these values come from the second shader.p  pIf i change the function SamplePix in the second shader to always take from the second sampler both appear green, and if lookups up from the third then all appears yellow, but it seems to only read from one.p  pFor now I cant seem to explain why I can read from each sampler ok but the loop doesnt seem to lookup correctly in shader 2p  pAlso if I switch to rendering the texture sampled in shader 2 i see a black quad in the second pass image 2p  pHopefully someone can throw some light on the problem. I have also tried adding a sync fence object after the first pass but this didnt make a differencep  pa hrefhttps13.postimage.orghidepa4irred.pnghttps13.postimage.orghidepa4irred.pngap  pTexture

Negative 773 pI noticed that the application size of my app, as reported by android, was doubled respect to the same application two months ago, despite I did only minor modifications. Even building the .apk from the same source code I used two months ago, I obtain a bigger .apk. I did some investigations and noticed that the classes.dex was way bigger. It seems that something changed in the build environment. Is it possible that the last android SDK causes bigger .dex classes is it due to something else Im using android SKD inside Eclipse Indigigo Android SDK Tools rev. 21 Android SKD Platformtools rev. 16p

Negative 773 pI have over 150 UIImageViews. I need them to behave like a large ballet. I also need to be able to dynamically choreograph them. Some spin, some duck, some jump each currently a different UIImageView subclass.p  pIm assuming I need to put them all into an NSDictionary, then grab the object based on a key and say you spin, you jump, you duck. And do those moves in sync while the music is playing no real music, but instead data coming in from an external source. And I have no idea what that musicdata will be until it arrives, and no ones heard the song before. Ive setup a codewhile musiccode loop with a large switch statement inside.p  pId like to place all the ballerinas on the view in the nib by hand so that they line up correctly with the subview. None of them change x,y. They might only change z, and maybe swap an image, fade opacity, etc which I was calling spin, duck and jump. And there is no user interaction here, youre just in the audience.p  pIm also assuming Ill need to use the UIViews beginAnimation, setAnimation, commitAnimation methods.p  pAm I on the right track Whats the best way to achieve this Any optimizations I should considerbrApologies for all the analogies, its the easiest way to explain what Im trying to achieve.p

Negative 773 pok, I know that most current phones and a 7 inch tablet are both considered large as far as screen size according to Android. But theres a big difference between a large phone with 480x800 pixels and a large 7 inch tablet with 800x1280 pixels. Ive created separate layouts for those two sizes, but I still havent wrapped my head around how to get the phone to see the 480x800 layout and have the tablet see the 800x1280 layout. Ive tried tweaking the res folder names to things like codelayoutlargehdpicode and codelayoutlargemdpicode, and also leaving the smaller phone layout as codelayoutcode and the larger, tablet layout as codelayoutsw600dpcode as the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesscreenssupport.htmlDeclaringTabletLayouts relnofollowDeclaring Tablet Layouts for Android 3.2a page suggests, but the problem there becomes Android is still looking in the codedrawablehdpicode for the phone sized images. So the question then is strongHow do I declare the phone layouts, and have the phone layout look in the phone drawables folder, and declare the tablet layout and have the layout look in the tablet drawables folderstrong Im targeting Android 3.2 with this app that Im working on.p

Negative 773 pOk, this might be a duplicate, but as I couldnt really get anything out of possibly similar questions, here is mine Im working on a small PyQt4 program where I can enter the name of a song in a QLineEdit and then add a QLabel of it beneath it.

Negative 773 pI have a question about style and best practices.p  pIf you have an html page with a lot of buttons connected to functions, would you rather set the onclick functions inside the input tag of the button, or would it be better to create a handler controller in Javascript that attaches onclick handlers to each buttonp  pI forgot to mention that the onclicks would be attached to a call to an existing function.  Im not actually trying to cram in anonymous functions in the HTMLp  pIm thinking that doing it all in Javascript would separate javascript from html, keeping my html page purer.  In addition, if the buttons are spread out among the page, a controller will have all their handlers in one location.p  pBut Im also wondering if I would be create a lot of unnecessary code.  I also think setting the onclick in my html page would be more readable to other coders, since they wouldnt have to look for which functions the buttons are tied to.p  pWhich do you think is preferablep

As far as I can tell there is  no way to be able to do this. I have only been using VS 2013 for around 3 weeks so there is probably still stuff that is hidden to me.p  pIf there is no way to do this within the program what is the next best thing for this I did see on another similar post that recommends the site a hrefhttpjsbeautifier.org relnofollow httpjsbeautifier.org a, so may have to give that ago but would make life easier if it was built into VS 2013p  pThanks in advance as I know someone will be able to help me out here.p  hr  h2Updateh2  pI have looked around VS 2013 and found nothing that can help me with this problem, like I said before they maybe some things I have missed certain settings so I guess if it cannot be done in VS whats the next best thing for the job I seem to run into a fair amount of JS that is minifed and would like the quickest and best way to get the job done. I couple sites I have tried seem to have problems with it, is there a program I could install that would just allow me to short cut it with a hotkey or something. That would be pretty handy. p  hr  h2Update 2h2  pSo I think its safe to say this cannot be done within VS2013, or for that matter at all due to missing var names and so on. So I have seen a few links and programs that allow you to format the code. Is there a way to do with within VS2013 And again if not what is the most reliable websiteprogram that I can use to do this. Like I said I can see there have been answers and I appreciate all of them. I will be leaving this question open for a while to get more people to look at it and possibly give a better answer. Keep it up guys p  hr  h2Update 3h2  pIf anyone has any more information on this please do share. I am still looking around now and then waiting for someone to come up with something amazing for this. One day people.... One dayp

However, in my case no matter what I do, Silverlight does not show the cameramic permission dialog and just silently crashes or raises an exception in the presence of a debugger.p  pI have tried this with VS2010, VS2013, Windows 7, 8 and 8.1. I even tried making registry changes to HKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftSilverlightAllowWebcam0x00000001. No effect.p  pAnother article suggested making changes to the silverlight group policy but it does not seem to be present on any of my systems. I have Chrome and IE with the latest upgrades, the OS is up to date and Solverlight is version 5.1.20513.0. Not sure if it matters but all my machiines are 64 bit.p

Negative 773 pIn our application we have a screen design feature which is comprised of a custom ScreenDesignPanel and a Property Grid with a codeComboBoxcode at the top which points to the selected item on the ScreenDesignPanel. This allows the user to select the UIElement via the ComboBox or via the mouse to set its properties. We achieve this by binding the ItemsSource of the ComboBox to the ScreenDesignPanels Children collection, then binding their SelectedItems together. This works great.p  pHowever, for whatever reason, if the codeSelectedItemcode is a codeContentControlcode or a subclass like codeButtoncode the codeItemTemplatecode specified for the codeComboBoxcode is ignored for the selected item area but it is applied when displaying the item in the dropdown list.  If the codeSelectedItemcode is not a codeContentControlcode, the template is used in both cases.p  pThis also is seemingly specific to the codeComboBoxcode. If we use emanyem other selector control codeListBoxcode, codeListViewcode, codeItemsControlcode... even thirdparty codeComboBoxcode controls... they all work as expected, properly applying the codeDataTemplatecode.  ComboBox is doing something internally which no other control is doing.p  pNote Below is an oversimplified example for illustrative purposes of the issue only.  It is not how were actually using it as described above.p  pAlso of note strongemIn the DataTemplate for the ComboBox.ItemTemplate, we are only using properties i.e. Foreground in the example, and are not displaying the DataContext i.e. the actual ContentControl itself.emstrong This is important because again, the actual control already exists on the ScreenDesignPanel and therefore emcantem be used for display in the ComboBoxs ItemTemplate as it would have two parents which isnt allowed.  In other words, it is being used purely as data here.p  pOne last thing... we have a working solution in our app, which was to wrap the Children before binding it to the codeComboBox.ItemsSourcecode.  However, Im still curious as to why the codeComboBoxcode behaves the way it does which is strongemSPECIFICALLYemstrong what Im asking. In other words, Im not looking for other solutions to this design. We already have a working one.  Im looking for clarity on the odd behavior of the codeComboBoxcode itself.p  pOn to the codep  pIn the first example below, note how the data template is applied to everything in the dropdown, but the selected item area only uses a template if the selected item is not a codeContentControlcode.p  precodeltComboBoxgt      ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt          ltDataTemplategt             ltTextBlock TextI am the template ForegroundBinding Foreground gt         ltDataTemplategt      ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt              lt Four Data items for example only gt     ltTextBlock TextI am a Red TextBox ForegroundRedgt      ltListBox ForegroundPurplegt         ltListBoxItemgtI am a Purple ListBoxltListBoxItemgt     ltListBoxgt      ltContentControl ContentI am a Blue ContentControl ForegroundBlue gt      ltButton ContentI am a Button with Green text ForegroundGreen gt  ltComboBoxgt codepre  pThis second example shows that it is completely acceptable and fully supported to use a codeUIElementcode as the content of a codeContentPresentercode and still use a codeDataTemplatecode via codeContentTemplatecode so you can use it in a purelydata role, allowing the template itself to define the visual appearance without displaying the UIElement itself, which is used purely as data here.p  precodeltContentPresentergt      ltContentPresenter.ContentTemplategt          ltDataTemplategt             ltTextBlock TextI am the ContentTemplate ForegroundBinding Foreground gt         ltDataTemplategt      ltContentPresenter.ContentTemplategt      ltContentPresenter.Contentgt         ltButton ContentI am the button ForegroundGreen gt     ltContentPresenter.Contentgt  ltContentPresentergt codepre  pAgain, the issue is strongspecificstrong to a codeComboBox.code I want to find out why the data template isnt applied in that single case, and how to force it to be applied, if possible.p  pOf note, codeComboBoxcode does define codeSelectionBoxItemTemplatecode which is separate from the regular codeItemTemplatecode but the rub is that is readonly so you cant set it.  We really dont want to retemplate the codeComboBoxcode as that can mess up proper theming.p

Negative 773 pI have an AngularJS form that contains  among other fields  one of type codeurlcode. The latter is important as this forces the corresponding input to be a valid URL.p  pUnder certain conditions for instance, a modal dialog with such a form is to be closed, I want to clear that form programmatically. For that purpose, I implemented method coderesetcode that basically clears the corresponding form model by setting codescope.formData  code. Thus, it sets the form model to a new, blank object.p  pWhile that assignment clears all strongvalidstrong fields in the rendered HTML form, it does strongnotstrong clear stronginvalidstrong fields, like an invalid URL. For instance, if the user would provide invalid input codehttpcode as URL, that input would not be removed from the rendered form.p  pI think this is due to the fact that any invalid URL is not reflected by the model  such an invalid URL just wouldnt make it to the model because it does not pass validation in the codeNgModelControllerparserscode array. Thus, in the model  there is no URL at all. Consequently, resetting the form model to codecode cannot actually emchangeem the models URL as it has not been set yet.p  pHowever, if method coderesetcode explicitly sets field codescope.formData.url  code, the invalid URL will be cleared properly at least, the rendered form wont show it anymore. This is caused by the emexplicitem change of the URL in the model. However, now, model variable codeformData.urlcode contains the empty string well, not surprisingly, while by using code code, all fields would be codeundefinedcode instead.p  pWhile assigning individual fields to codecode works as workaround for simple forms, it quickly becomes cumbersome for more complex forms with many fields.p  pThus, how could I programmatically reset the form efficiently and effectively  including all invalid input fields as wellp  pI created a Plunker at a hrefhttpplnkr.coc2Yhzshttpplnkr.coc2Yhzsa where you can examine and run a complete example showing the above effect.p

It would be fine with me too as long as the resulting formatted addresses always include the number or never do. Either way, Im ok. Im just not ok with the inconsistency.p  pThank you.p
Negative 773 pI have a PHP application that allows users to upload files PDF or JPG up to 2mb, and the files are stored in MySQL rows with blob fields of up to 64kb.  Files larger than 64kb are distributed across as many rows as needed, with all linked to another table with the file information.  Regardless of the file, this works well  exactly once.  The uploaded file can  be retrieved using the PHP that queries and reconstructs it to stream to the browser, or write to a temp directory for download. No problem.  p  pBut after the first upload, two things change p  p1 Additional uploads appear successful on upload, and the blobs are of the expected size, but when retrieved they are corrupted.  In PDFs this means the dreaded Files does not begin with PDF or a more general message, depending on the browser and plugin used.  For JPGs, the file will appear missing in the browser streaming or will only partially load, missing the bottom half.  p  p2 The table containing the blobs shows overhead, anywhere from 500kb to 2mb.  p  pAfter I use phpMyAdmins Optimize Table, or strongOPTIMIZE TABLE ffiledatastrong, the problem goes away, and the next uploaded file is fine and viewable.  But after that one good upload, the problem is back and subsequent uploads are corrupted.  I have repeated this little experiment many times and its very consistent.  p  pTable type is MyISAM, and table collation is ut8unicodeci.  Blob field is blob  the 2162 which is just enough for the 64kb chunks.  Still a single upload creates new overhead.

Negative 773 pSo i have the giant 1K java ee7 tutorial book blowing up APIs in my face and im really confused on what java ee actually is. So far i know html5, javascript, css, sql i just need the server side. My initial choice was java ee.p  pThe way i imagined it, was that ill use html5jscss for the presentation layer. And through js  AJAX, i will make requests to the server and get responses. Similarly, learn some js framework like Angular, which i will then hook with the server. But reading though the java apis, it seems like JSF or JSP is a whole solution for the client side and there wont be need for js at all.p  pI realize that containers like EJB are used for the business logic. In a webchat site, that would mean that EJB will handle connections, pushpull messages from a EIS like a db, distribute user info, broadcast messages, etc... Which is what im looking for, i think, rightp  pI dont know whether im a bad reader and out of my league or the book itself is bad, but they just provide some obscure description of a particular API which you cant comprehend how it fits in the whole picture. So essentially, what im asking is which parts i should concentrate on when learning java ee or should i just ditch it all together and go with PHPp

Negative 773 pour application shows interstitial iAds after each played level. At the moment a level finishes, we create the adp  precodeinterstitial  [[ADInterstitialAd alloc] init] interstitial.delegate  self codepre  pand the delegate implements the following callback methodsp  precode voidinterstitialAdDidUnloadADInterstitialAd interstitialAd      [self finish]   voidinterstitialAdADInterstitialAd interstitialAd didFailWithErrorNSError error      [self finish]   voidinterstitialAdDidLoadADInterstitialAd interstitialAd      [interstitial presentFromViewControllerself]   voidinterstitialAdActionDidFinishADInterstitialAd interstitialAd      [self finish]  codepre  pwhereas the finish method cleans up things and forwards the user to the main menu.  from the moment the ad object is created until the finish method is called, a spinning wheel is displayed on the screen.p  pNow the thing is that if no ad is loaded for example if no internet connection is available none of the callback functions ever gets called, so we also add a NSTimer when creating the Ad and check back after 10 seconds, like thisp  precodeinterstitial  [[ADInterstitialAd alloc] init] interstitial.delegate  self timer  [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval10                                           targetself                                         selectorselectorcheckForAds                                         userInfonil                                          repeatsfalse]  voidcheckForAdsNSTimer timer      [timer invalidate]     ifinterstitial.loaded         [self finish]  codepre  pbut this seems very unclean  and also it leads to a 10 seconds spinning wheel delay after each level if no internet connection is available for example or if the connection is very bad.p  pso, my questionsp  ol lipwhats the proper way to deal with this I feel a timer here is not the right thing.pli lipIm currently considering to create the Ad object before the level starts, and then after the level finishes immediately check the interstitial.loaded property and show the ad in this case or skip over it otherwise, without using a timer. The problem is that a level session can take quite long between 1 and 60 minutes Id say and I read that ads can expire, however there is no indication in the documentation how long it usually takes until ads expire and what happens in this case. Will the interstitial.loaded property return false if the ad expired in the meantime in the background is some callback function called when the ad expires Is it a viable approach to create the ad object before a level starts that is, 160 minutes before the ad actually gets displayed and later just check if interstitial.loaded is true and in this case display the adpli ol
Negative 773 pI am writing an application that would asynchronously trigger some events. The test looks like this set everything up, sleep for sometime, check that event has triggered.p  pHowever because of that waiting the test takes quite a time to run  Im waiting for about 10 seconds on every test. I feel that my tests are slow  there are other places where I can speed them up, but this sleeping seems the most obvious place to speed it up.p  pWhat would be the correct way to eliminate that sleep Is there some way to cheat datetime or something like thatp  pThe application is a tornadobased web app and async events are triggered with IOLoop, so I dont have a way to directly trigger it myself.p  pEdit more details.p  pThe test is a kind of integration test, where I am willing to mock the 3rd party code, but dont want to directly trigger my own code.p  pThe test is to verify that a certain message is sent using websocket and is processed correctly in the browser. Message is sent after a certain timeout which is started at the moment the client connects to the websocket handler. The timeout value is taken as a difference between codedatetime.nowcode at the moment of connection and a value in database. The value is artificially set to be codedatetime.now  5 secondscode before using selenium to request the page. Since loading the page requires some time and could be a bit random on different machines I dont think reducing the 5 seconds time gap would be wise. Loading the page after timeout will produce a different result no websocket message should be sent.p  pSo the problem is to somehow force tornados IOLoop to send the message at any moment after the websocket is connected  if that happened in 0.5 seconds after setting the database value, 4.5 seconds left to wait and I want to try and eliminate that delay.p  pTwo obvious places to mock are IOLoop itself and datetime.now. the question is now which one I should monkeypatch and how.p

Negative 773 pI cant believe that Im asking this right now, but I have no idea how solve the following problemp  pI have a web app that logs every visited page in a browser for better browser history search. The extension is a chrome extension that needs to make a POST request to my API.

However, since the extension runs in a different origin as a contentscript, I cannot retrieve CSRF tokens, hence I cannot make authenticated POST requests.p  pEDITp  pSo I now know that I can use chrome.storage and equivalents in other browsers to store a token that only my contentscript can read.

Negative 773 pI have a Windows Forms application that I am upgrading to target a newer .Net Framework.  For one of my unit tests, a greyscale TIFF image is used to create a Bitmap.  The pixel data is extracted and then run through an algorithm to determine the center of a fiducial that is in the image.  On Windows XP, Visual Studio 2005, .Net Framework 2.0 the correct center is located and the test passes.  On Windows 7 64Bit, Visual Studio 2013, .Net Framework 4.0 the test fails because the center that it finds is off by a small amount.  p  pI have inspected the pixel data on one machine to the next by debugging and looking at the Byte array.  The pixel values on the XP machine are a little different than pixel values on the Windows 7 machine.  Its the same exact image and the same code on both machines.  One other thing is that this only occurs on greyscale images, all the color images pass and the ones I checked had the same pixel values.

He asked if the TIF was compressed.p  pWhen I look at the TIF Information with IrfanViewer it showed that it is using LZW compression. I saved a copy of the Greyscale TIF in question and chose to not compress the image.  When I debugged the unit test with this image I was able to see the values that I was hoping for and the unit test passed.  It appears that the compression is affecting the pixel values and something is working a little differently in my new setup. p  pWhats interesting is that this difference in pixel values does not appear to happen on the color images, even though they are compressed with LZW also.p  pAny further thoughts on the reason this might be different on the newer setupp

Everything works with this as expected.p  pHowever, I would like for if the user clicks on a back button, that not only is the codeUIViewControllercode dismissed and the user returned to the previous codeUIViewControllercode which I have already, but I would like for the processing associated with the codefor loopcode that is occurring within codevoidgetInfocode and codeNSXMLParsercode to be terminated immediately if indeed it is still running. p  pIn most scenarios, the processing would be complete, and this will not be an issue, however, there are possible instances where this may take a little longer, and I do not wish for the code to continue to run after pressing back, as there is then no need for the data, and thus would simply be wasting resource, and potentially jam the UI when returning to the previous UIViewController due to the processing of the multiple codeNSURLcode s.p  precodevoidgetInfo     NSDictionary places  [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithContentsOfFile[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResourceplaces ofTypeplist]]     NSArray placescc  [[NSArray alloc] initWithArrayplaces.allKeys]     block NSUInteger placewaiting  placescc.count     NSUserDefaults defaults  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]     NSDictionary savedLocs  [[defaults objectForKeysavedLocs]mutableCopy] got savedLocs     NSDictionary thisLoc  [[savedLocs objectForKeyLocId]mutableCopy] got this Loc      lastInfoCount  0  set default     if [[thisLoc objectForKeyInfos]count]         lastInfoCount  [[thisLoc objectForKeyInfos]count]  set saved count if we have one           for NSString place in placescc          dispatchasyncdispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYDEFAULT, 0,              NSURL url  [NSURL URLWithString[NSString stringWithFormathttpurl.com,place, LocIdString]]             NSXMLParser parser  [[NSXMLParser alloc] initWithContentsOfURLurl]              dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,                  [parser setDelegateself]                 [parser setShouldResolveExternalEntitiesNO]                 [parser parse]                  placewaiting  placewaiting1                 if placewaiting  0                      [self.tableView reloadData]                     [self.activityIndicator stopAnimating]                     lastRefresh  [NSString stringWithFormat,[NSDate date]]                                              codepre

The duraction of the inactivity is known from debug printfs in the process itself.

Instead, the task just starts running, with no indication of why it had been held up.p  pIve tried elevating the tasks priority from another process after a few seconds when the hangup occurs using codesetpriorityPRIOPROCESS, ltpidgt, 20code thats why the priority appears as 100 in the above trace, instead of the default 120 but it made no difference, so I dont believe the issue is priority related.p  pWhat can I do now to find out what is causing the task suspension  Im not that familiar with debugging in kernel space  are there any other tools in the ftrace suite that can be run on a single pid to see what its doing  Any other kernel debug tools  I can recognise when the problem has occurred, but only after a few seconds has passed  so I can trigger or stop any data captures at that point, but tracing events that happened more than that time ago is tricky.p  pThe kernel is version 2.6.33, if that helps. Upgrading to a later version isnt a practical proposition for various reasons.p  pAny advice or suggestions on how to debug this further are very welcomep

Negative 773 pI have a string that stores a decimal value, for instance, 0.10. I want to convert this to a float. But when I use atof to do it, the number I get is not exactly the value it should be. Im writing some complicated algorithms involving some number crunching of decimal values, so this is throwing my final results off.p  pHere is some simple code that describes the problem Im having. Here, I simply put a decimal value into a string, convert it to a float with atof, and print it out with cout. The result Im getting shows that atof is adding a tiny decimal number to the final value.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt include ltcstdlibgt using namespace std  int main      string value  0.10     float valueAsFloat  atofvalue.cstr      cout.precision20     cout ltlt valueAsFloat ltlt endl      return 0  codepre  pThe output isp  precode0.10000000149011611938 codepre  pAny ideas Im using the GNU g compiler on Ubuntu.

Negative 773 pActually we are building an authoring tool through which authors will prepare some assessment. Assessment can be kind of MCQ or Multiple choice. Now in that assessment imageaudiovideo can be a part of question as well as answers. Now to store all these assessment we will use alfresco repository. Now while storing or creating the assessment authors can define or create different custom properties for image file or any type of file. we have to provide those kind of facilities while creating the assessment to authors. Now our system can talk to different enterprise content management system, thats why we are planning to use CMISRESTful services of alfresco. We found those RESTful api through which we can createupload directoryfile in an alfresco repository but till we did not find any RESTful api to create custom metadata in alfresco. Do alfresco have any RESTful API to create custom metadataproperties while uploadingcreating new file in alfresco If not what are the other ways Is there any way apart from configuration or settings changes so that we can create those custom metadata on the fly API will be good as because we can use them directly from UI using jquery or angular.. any help regarding this will be much appreciated. p

The pivot table does not recognize the codeNAcode errors as errors and instead converts the whole field to text.

Ive been following the Udacitys MOOC on App Engine, and they taught us how to authenticate the user for API request using a Google Accounts. On the backend side, we simply have to add a codeUsercode parameter to our method, and check if the user is signed in. As far as I know, this user parameter is generated by App Engine, based on the codeAuthorizationcode header of our request. emmight need some confirmation thereemp  pNow, theres a bunch of stuff Im not sure to understand and that werent that well explained on this MOOC.p  pNow, Id like to know if this is compatible with other OAuth schemes, beside Google So, if I want to implement Facebook authentication, will I simply pass the facebook access tokenp  pFrom what I searched, using the Facebook SDK on Android would lead me to be able to generate a User Access Token, which identifies my user strongto facebookstrong.

Negative 773 pI have a case with 7 different states. So in state 1, users can fill some fields from a list. And one of my ifstatements is when the field Connect to is filled with a number, my code sends an email to the user. But they dont have to fill this column only in the state 1, they can also do it in state 2 or maybe state 3.p  pBut the problem is, if they filled this column in state 1 and proceed, then goes to state 2 and 3, the code will recognize that the field has a value and will send another email.p  pHow should I customize my ifstatement that if the code ALREADY sent one email, that it shouldnt be sent again Thanksp

Negative 773 pI have a big actionscript project with several external libraries added to dependencies tab. To optimize compilation time I decided to create a module that will compile all these libraries to a single swc. And that is something Ive encounter problem with as IntelliJ seems to ignore linkage settings for these libraries. I set linkage to include so that my swc will aggregate all the code from external libraries but instead it looks like I always end up with merged linkage mode. p  pIf my swcmodule has no additional code, then IntelliJ will refuse to compile it at all because it says that theres nothing to compile. If I create a dummy class that will access some classes from external libraries then it will compile an swc but with only mentioned classes. Thats exactly what merged linkage mode is.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwQUKR.png altexamplep  pI dont know if it is me doing something wrong or it is a bug in IntelliJ but its definitely a problem. So I decided to start with a question on StackOverflow.p

Negative 773 pIm supposed to answer specific questions given 2 different lists, a list of numbers and a list of words, using functions to answer said questions.p  pI currently am running into two problems.

They are just scattered like thisp  precodeThe length of the numbers[] is 14 56 is even. If you add 30 to 56, you get 86 If you add 30 to 3, you get 33 If you add 30 to 9, you get 39 1002 is even. 1002 is greater than 100. If you add 30 to 1002, you get 1032 If you add 30 to 33, you get 63 66 is even. If you add 30 to 66, you get 96 789 is greater than 100. If you add 30 to 789, you get 819 9001 is greater than 100. If you add 30 to 9001, you get 9031 999 is greater than 100. If you add 30 to 999, you get 1029 222 is even. 222 is greater than 100. If you add 30 to 222, you get 252 82 is even. If you add 30 to 82, you get 112 If you add 30 to 71, you get 101 If you add 30 to 5, you get 35 If you add 30 to 3, you get 33 codepre  pHow exactly would I go about making them in a more organized listp

So we use the embedded container a bit like thisp  precodeBefore public void setUp    EJBContainer container  javax.ejb.embeddable.EJBContainer.createEJBContainerproperties   SomeStatelessService someStatelessService  SomeStatelessService container.getContext.lookupSOMESTATELESSSERVICE  codepre  pcodeSomeStatelessServicecode depends on several EJB. The problem that Im encountering is that when I manually inject mocked objects into codeSomeStatelessServicecode, they are not used it uses the containerprovided object instead. We inject a mocked object like thisp  precodeTest public void someTest    SomeObject mockObject  Mockito.mockSomeObject.class   Mockito.whenmockObject.getMaxResults.thenReturn1   someStatelessService.someObject  mockObject   assertEquals1, someStatelessService.getResults.size  codepre  pI can tell that the mocked object isnt being used because codegetMaxResultscode is returning a different value, one loaded from a database.p  pI think this actually makes sense. codeSomeStatelessServicecode is Stateless, so I shouldnt expect the mocked object to persist in the emcontainermanagedem instance. That said, when I change it to Stateful, it still fails, but Im probably just misunderstanding the lifecycle.p  pHow can I override the containerprovided dependency in this examplep
Negative 773 pI did some search but non of them satisfy my requirements, may be I searched the wrong keywords, if so please point me to the right direction.p  pI have Android and iOS client app, and Rails for backend. Mobile users can login to their account and send message to their friends. Right now Im using http request  Push Notification to implement this. More specific, we have client codeAcode and codeBcode, codeAcode will send a message along with codeBcodes id, and server will push that message to codeBcode and add that message to a codemessagescode table with codeunreadcode property. If codeBcode open message page, those messages of codeAcode and codeBcode will become codereadcode.p  pAfter I did some research, I realized if both codeAcode and codeBcode are messaging to each other, i.e codeAcodes message page is sending to codeBcode, and vice versa, it would be better to use socket to send messages, more efficient. p  pNow my question is I should use Rails as codeserver socketcode and each client just connect to codeservercode, or one of codeAcode or codeBcode will be the server socket If Rails as codeserver socketcode and there are lots of traffic or open sockets at the same time, is that gonna be a problemp

The exercise involves creating a codeRobotcode data type which is capable of storing a name, which is randomly generated exercise codeReadmecode is included below.  p  pFor those who arent familiar with it, the codeexercism.iocode learning model is based on automated testing of studentgenerated code.  Each exercise consists of a series of tests written by the test author and the solution code must be able to pass all of them.  Our code must pass all tests in a given exercises test file, before we can move to the next exercise  an effective model, imo. codeRobot Namecode is exercise 20 or so.p  pIn this particular exercise, were asked to create a codeRobotcode datatype and three accompanying functions codemkRobotcode, coderobotNamecode and coderesetNamecode.p  ul licodemkRobotcode generates an instance of a codeRobotcode li licoderobotNamecode generates and returns a unique name for a unnamed codeRobotcode i.e., coderobotNamecode does not overwrite a preexisting name if a codeRobotcode already has a name, it simply returns the existing nameli licoderesetNamecode overwrites a preexisting name with a new one.li ul  pIn this particular exercise, there are 7 tests.

Negative 773 pFrom reading the docs a hrefhttpeffbot.orgtkinterbookcanvas.htmreference relnofollowhttpeffbot.orgtkinterbookcanvas.htmreferencea, there doesnt appear to me to be a way to do this. Just wanted to make sure I hadnt made a mistake. I.e. one would have to internally store the coordinates of various items in a program if one wanted to do boundary checking, for example. [e.g. Check, before moving an oval, that it will not bump into a wall, represented by a line on the current canvas, the coordinate information of which is also stored.] p

Negative 773 pHi this is a beginner Java question about classes, it is for an assignment so I would just like a hint not the answer. I looked around for this answer in other forums but I didnt seem to find the answer, but I apologize if this has already been answered.p  pI have a class that has three inTime doubles defined in one class, and I need to write the doubles to the screen in another class. The doubles are taken in as input from the keyboard.p  pMy problem is, I have each inTime separated into three different double methods that return them as a double. When I set the new doubles in the writing class, to end the input I have to press enter, but I NEED the inTime inputs to be separated and ended by spaces. The only way I know how to set the variables is like thisp  precodepublic class Race  private double timeOne  0 private double timeTwo  0 private double timeThree  0  public double timeOne     Scanner keyboard  new ScannerSystem.in     timeOne  keyboard.nextDouble     return timeOne   public double timeTwo     Scanner keyboard  new ScannerSystem.in             timeTwo  keyboard.nextDouble     return timeTwo  public double timeThree     Scanner keyboard  new ScannerSystem.in             timeThree  keyboard.nextDouble     return timeThree  codepre  pThis is the writing classp  precodepublic class RaceReport   public void writeReport     Race race  new Race      System.out.printlnEnter the race times in seconds       double timeOne  race.timeOne     double timeTwo  race.timeTwo     double timeThree  race.timeThree codepre  pShould this be broken into three methods like I have, or only one method I have no idea how I could yield three variables from one void method, separate return methods were the only thing that made sense.p  pHere is what the screen should look like when the doubles are being enteredp  pEnter the race times in seconds 85.6 120.5 90.2p  pThe spaces separated should be separating the entriesp

Negative 773 pI am implementing an application in which there will be a database in Oracle 11G and multiple other MySQL databases. All databases will be synchronized with each other at least after 30 mins. Initially i thought of implementing GUIDUUID as primary key but then i came across its cons in innodb and got little worried. br I just want that my primary key to be unique with good performance which means that i am certainly looking for indexing. Please suggest what should i keep as my primary key. It is pertinent to mention that my database MySQL will be running on simple intel corei3 and i expect to have a million records on it whereas, oracle will run on a server which is not an issue.p

Negative 773 pIn my layout, I have a textview which I need to be fixed at the top of the screen, a button to be fixed at the bottom of the screen.  Between these two, I have a list with a textviewwith a drawable below it. please see image. I want the textview positioned below the listi.e. as list items grow, the textview should reposition itself. As I click on the textview, I add items to the list. I am able to achieve this, but as my list items increase, the textview goes below the list amp is not visible. So what I see on screen is the top textview with the list below it amp the bottom button. The textview to add items in list view is not visible, so I cannot add items to my list. I need that even if the list items increase, I want the list to be visible along with the textview.i.e. strongas list items grow, the textview should reposition itselfstrong. I tried various approaches suggested with several combinations of linear amp relative layouts amp positioning techniques, but I am not able to achieve this. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5nPFh.png altenter image description herep

Negative 773 pIm loosely following the tutorial on a hrefhttplearnopengl.com relnofollowwww.learnopengl.coma, Im currently passing multiple lights into my fragmentshader. For that Ive got multiple lightclasses and one class that acts as a container to be able to pass my lights uniforms into the shader.p  pThe shader is set up correctly. However when I call the function to pass the uniforms from the strongLightsstrong class, the uniforms doesnt seem to get passed correctly.

Negative 773 pI have a web application with master page.master and many content pages.aspx. All the .aspxcontent pages pages are placed in different folders. p  pWhen i access the web application strongfor the first timestrong, for loading the default pageHome page its taking time, this is expected as the server tries to compile and load the pages for the first timecorrect me if i am wrong.p  pOnce the default home page is loaded then when i tried to navigate to other aspx pages, it is still taking time to load. Why do this happen, the pages are already compiled when home page is loaded.p  pDo the server compile only the files in root folder while processing the first requestp  pWhen a user requests for a particular page which is placed in a folder, are all other pages with in the folder are compiled as wellp  pThanks, Krisp

Negative 773 pI have developed a RESTful API using the Djangorestframework in python. I developed the required models, serialised them, set up token authentication and all the other due diligence that goes along with it.p  pI also built a frontend using Angular, hosted on a different domain. I setup CORS modifications so I can access the API as required. Everything seems to be working fine.p  pHere is the problem. The web app I am building is a financial application that should allow the user to run some complex calculations on the server and send the results to the frontend app so they can be rendered into charts and other formats. I do not know how or where to put these calculations.p  pI chose Django for the backend as I expected that python would help me run such calculations wherever required. Basically, when I call a particular api link on the server, I want to be able to retrieve data from my database, from multiple tables if required, and use the data to run some calculations using python or a library of python pandas or numpy and serve the results of the calculations as response to the API call.p  pIf this is a daunting task, I at least want to be able to use the API to retrieve data from the tables to the frontend, process the data a little using JS, and send it to a python function located on the server with this processed data, and this function would run the necessary complex calculations and respond with results which would be rendered into charts  other formats.p  pCan anyone point me to a direction to move from here I looked for resources online but I think I am unable to find the correct keywords to search for them. I just want a shell code kind of a thing to integrate into my current backed using which I can call some python scripts that I write to run these calculations.p  pThanks in advance.p

There are certain combinations of parameters that cause me to get a double free or corruption error on codereturn 0code.

If I use the parameters code10code and code4code the program creates 4 threads that do 2 iterations on 3 threads and 4 on the 4th thread, works fine. However, if I use code5code and code3code, the program will correctly calculate the value and even print it out, but I get the error immediately after. This also happens for code17code and code3code, and code10code and code3code. I tried code15code and code7code, but then I get a codemunmapchunk invalid pointercode error when the threads are trying to be joined  although i think thats something for another question.p  pIf I had to guess, it has something to do with codepthreadexitcode deallocating memory and then the same memory trying to be deallocated again on codereturncode, since Im passing the parameter struct as a pointer. I tried a few different things like creating a local copy and defining codeparameterListcode as a vector of pointers, but it didnt solve anything. Ive also tried codeerasecodeing and codeclearcodeing the vector before codereturncode but that didnt help either.p

Negative 773 pI am employing ns3 for simulating TCP new reno source in a congested network, and i seek to trace the lost and retransmitted packets. In my experiment, the payload of the TCP packet is 1 byte which makes the overall packet size 43 bytes. Now, the packet with sequence number  89 gets lost at t  1.056s. It is retransmitted at t  1.075s, and successfully received at t  1.093s. The length of the retransmitted packet is 120 bytes. In the intervening time 1.056 lt t lt 1.093, more packet are lost. But the pcap trace does not show the retransmission of these, since the receiver keeps sending packets with ACK  89 till t  1.093s. How are the other lost packets recovered, and what is the justification for the increased length of retransmitted packets Are these corelated in any wayp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 773 pIm working on a software which gathers snapshots from cameras and saves the record of that snapshot into a snapshots table. We have thousands of cameras and hundreds of millions of snapshot records. Every snapshot record contains only a small amount of data  id, cameraid, timestamp and notes string field for additional information.p  pWere starting to notice performance issues in some of the queries, mainly with fetching a number of snapshots in a given time range. Aside from upgrading the hardware that Postgres is running on, were looking for alternative ways to improve the performance of the whole system.p  pThe team had a similar situation before using MongoDB, with one table for cameras and one for snapshots. They switched to using a separate snapshots table for each camera, resulting in a couple of thousands of snapshot tables. This improved performance by 10x without causing new problems.p  pNow were facing the same problem on Postgres. Even though the above solution worked, it doesnt seem like something that a database would be optimized for. Would it be a crazy idea to do the same thing in Postgres Is there a known limitation in a number of tables youd normally use I wasnt able to find good information for this usecase.p

Negative 773 pI have an iOS app integrated with Parse.com in which I want to schedule push notifications for certain datestimes. I am storing a push notification time on PFInstallation objects for users who have an upcoming event.  I have a scheduled job running on Parse CloudCode that queries for push notification times that need to be sent within the next minute.  strongIs this a good way to architect this  If so, how can I send this pushstrong  codeParse.Pushcode takes a query for its codewherecode field, but queries only return up to 1000 results which doesnt scale at all for a free app. Thus, Im trying to use codeParse.query.eachcode which has an unlimited number of results. However, now Im unsure how to send a push to each installation this way  Do I need to create another query within my codeeachcode statement  That seems redundant and inefficient.p  pNote that the push notification is a silent notification with the contentavailable flag set so local notifications are not an option.
