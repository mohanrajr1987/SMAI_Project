The interviewer didnt look pleased and he moved on to the next question.p  pCan anyone tell me what did the interviewer may have wanted to ask and what would be the answer  I think this can interpreted in different ways and hence keeping this as wiki unless someone point out not to..p

Negative 30408 pHey all, Ive been building an app for a client and part of it uses Apples TopSongs sample app to download data on another thread. I finally got enough done to start testing that part and found 1000 leaks A closer look at the leaks made me check TopSongs for leaks, since none of the my methods were in leaks report. Running TopSongs returned 26 leaks. Not quite sure how to fix them, or if they are part of some library from Apple.p  pI bet youre asking if it has 26, why do you have 1000 Well, I use their sample to make roughly 48 calls to webservices to get all the information needed on initial install 48 calls x 26 leaks  1248 leaks. Later it makes at least 12 calls  4 to check for updated information on other sections of the app. Cant do a thing about it, cant make one call, or less calls, please dont comment about this part. I seen people respond to posts that arent necessarily answering the question the user originally posted, which in this case is has anyone tried patching up the leaks, if they are patchable, or is this a bug in Apples librariesp  pThanks so much.p

Negative 30408 pIm wondering why the partial class concept even exists in CVB.NET. Im working on an application and we are reading a actually very good book relavant to the development platform we are implementing at work. In the book he provides a large code base wrapper around the platform API and explains how he developed it as he teaches different topics about the platform development.p  pAnyway, long story short  he uses partial classes, all over the place, as a way to fake multiple inheritance in C IMO. Why he didnt just split the classes up into multiple ones and use composition is beyond me. He will have 3 partial class files to make up his base class, each w 3500 lines of code... And does this several times in his API.p  pemstrongDo you find this justifiableemstrong If it were me, Id have followed the S.R.P. and created multiple classes to handle different required behaviors, then create a base class that has instances of these classes as members e.g. composition. Why did MS even put partial class into the framework They removed the ability to expandcollapse all code at each scope level in C this was allowed in C because it was obviously just allowing bad habits  partial class is IMO the same thing. strongemI guess my quetion is Can you explain to me when there would be a legitimate reason to ever use a partial classemstrong p  pemstrongEDIT Im aware that for WebWinforms there is no other choice. But outside of this Why didnt MS just put some different keyword for glueing codegenned classes togeather Or is there really a legit design scenario that merits itemstrongp  pemstrongI do not mean this to be a rant  war thread. Im honeslty looking to learn something here. When should partial classes be used in code design   simple question, no need to closeemstrongp  pThanksp

Negative 30408 pIm trying to do a relative jump in x86 assembly, however I can not get it to work. It seems that for some reason my jump keeps getting rewritten as an absolute jump or something.p  pA simple example program for what Im trying to do is thisp  precode.global main  main     jmp 0x4     ret codepre  pSince the jmp instruction is 4 bytes long and a relative jump is offset from the address of the jump  1, this should be a fancy noop. However, compiling and running this code will cause a segmentation fault.p  pThe real puzzler for me is that compiling it to the object level and then disassembling the object file shows that it looks like the assembler is correctly doing a relative jump, but after the file gets compiled the linker is changing it into another type of jump. p  pFor example if the above code was in a file called asmtest.sp  precodegcc c asmtest.s objdump D asmtest.o  ... Some info from objdump 00000000 ltmaingt    0    e9 00 00 00 00           jmp    5 ltmain0x5gt    5    c3                       ret    codepre  pThis looks like the assembler correctly made a relative jump, although its suspicious that the jmp instruction is filled with 0s. p  pI then used gcc to link it then disassembled it and got thisp  precodegcc o asmtest asmtest.o objdump d asmtest  ...Extra info and other disassembled functions 08048394 ltmaingt  8048394        e9 6b 7c fb f7      jmp   4 ltinit0x8048274gt  8048399        c3                  ret codepre  pThis to me looks like the linker rewrote the jmp statement, or substituted the 5 in for another address.p  pSo my question comes down to, what am I doing wrongp  pAm I specifying the offset incorrectly Am I misunderstanding how relative jumps work Is gcc trying to make sure I dont do dangerous things in my codep

Negative 30408 pIs there a good way to manage roll out of new software in SpringTomcat configuration. The problem I am trying to address is being able to rollback newly deployed software provided there are no hard dependencies on other moving pieces. For example changed the guts of an algorithm and now want to deploy the new software with the new change off by default and then turning it on on one of the web servers. An obvious way is to build a session object which has a map of keyvalue pairsproperty,bool which is populated from a db on a session startup and then the value is persisted for that session. This is so that if the value is reverted back existing sessions which started with the original value retain the original value and giving application consistency. Is there a more obvious inbuilt mechanism to do this p
Negative 30408 pI have a deployed app that samples measurements from sensors e.g., Temp C, Pressure kPa. The user can create Experiments and collect samples. Each sample is stored as a Run, such that there is a onetomany relationship from Experiment to Run.

But this means that the Run lt Data relationship needs to become Run lt Data to use Xcodes convention.p  pI am faced with trying to migrate data from old Run toone Data model to new Run tomany Data model. Can this be done using Mapping Models If so, does anyone have any pointers to examples If not, does anyone have any pointers to examples of how to do thatp  pThanks for any pointers or advice.p

Negative 30408 pI have a function which makes a call to the server to load some financial data. This data is then displayed in a grid. In order to keep displaying the latest data I keep making this server call every 30 secs. Im using a Timer object to do this.  The problem I have is that I have to wait 30 secs when the application starts for financial data to be displayed, what Id like to happen is that the load data call is made, then start the update timer. Is there a way to set this up or shall I use to data load calls, one to get the initial data, then one to get the updates, which is made every 30 secsp  pThanksp  pStephen p
Negative 30408 pWhats the right way to do thisp  pI have an array that I will use on several methods. I will add objects to it, get values, replace values, etc.p  pToday I do thisp  pI declare it on .h, using something likep  precodeNSMutableArray myArray codepre  pas soon as the application starts, I declare it on .m doing something likep  precodemyArray  [[[NSArray alloc] init] retain] codepre  pIf I dont add the retain the array will be released at some point and the application will crash. But allocating the array at the beginning of the application and left it open without releasing it will make instruments cry, pointing the finger at me, calling me a leaker... p  pHow to solve that Is this the correct way to do that how do you guys do stuff like thisp  pthanks p
Negative 30408 pIve currently spent the best part of my day grappling with dependency hell something I havent really experienced in a while.  Im attempting to use Scala 2.8.0 as per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3066682whatframeworkstousetobootstrapmyfirstproductionscalaprojectthe answers to this questiona, and the fact that I intend to use Actors  for which the forkjoin pool seems to be faster according to community buzz, anyhow.p  pThe problem Im facing is the supporting toolchain Id like to use configgy and querulous for configuration management and database abstraction, respectively.  I cannot for the life of me find versions of these libraries that support 2.8.0.RC6 or at least, not versions that I can get working.p  pI tried a hrefhttpgithub.comrobeyconfiggytreescala2.8 relnofollowthe semiofficial brancha of configgy, but that hasnt been updated since Beta1.  I also tried a hrefhttpgithub.comijumaconfiggytree relnofollowijumas forka, but thats still on 1.4.3.  Ive just noticed a hrefhttpgithub.comjboyensconfiggytree relnofollowjboyens forka, which appears to be up to date, so Ill give that a go when I get home tonight.p  pFor querulous, I found a hrefhttpgithub.combwmcadamsqueruloustree relnofollowa 2.8 forka, but that then spiralled into its own set of dependency problems with the advent of xrayspecs and configgy both being required.p  pAm I looking in the wrong place  I cant find uptodate versions of these libraries in the scalatools nexus, nor in any other maven repositories.  Id much prefer to use 2.8.0 over 2.7.7, but at this point in time Im ready to fall back on stable and forwardport my code at a later date which is a bit of a pain in the ass, given how close 2.8.0 is.p  pI guess the questions are can anyone advise me where I might be able to find 2.8.0 compatible versions of these libraries please  And while RC6 is out now, is anyone able to offer a ballpark weeksmonths prediction as to when 2.8.0 will go finalp  pThanks in advance for any help offered.p

Negative 30408 pA submitted form on my site returns an array of request data that is accessible with p  precodedata  thisgtgetRequest codepre  pThis happens in the controller which gathers the data and then passes this array to my model for placingupdating into the database.p  pHere is the problem.

Person B loads employee record 3 in his session, and it has version 4. Person A makes changes and commits. This works because the most recent version in the database is 4. It is now 5. Person B makes changes and commits. This fails because the most recent version is 5, while his is 4.p  pHow would the codeEFFECTIVE DATEcode pattern address this issuep  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pI think I could do it by doing something like this Person A loads employee record 3 in his session, and its effective date is 112010, 100 pm, with no experation. Person B loads employee record 3 in his session, and its effective date is 112010, 100 pm, with no experation. Person A makes changes and commits. The old copy goes to the archive table basically idea 2 with an experation date of 9222010 100 pm. The updated version of the main table has an effective date of 9222010 100 pm. Person B makes changes and commits. The commit fails because the effective dates in the database and session dont match.p

Negative 30408 pWhat is the most efficient way to detect modification to a file in Javap  pIve read about file polling however, the polling approach has a number of drawbacks that become apparent as the number of watched files increases. I rather not use polling but a number of solutions online appear to point to file polling as the recommended method. I was hoping for perhaps an OSrelated file system update callback solution instead  is this possible in both linux and windows p  pGiven that I currently only intend to watch 2 files, Im still kind of open to a file polling solution. Ideally, Im hoping file polling wont have a great impact on performance.p  pIm aware of Java 7s WatchService but since 7 hasnt been officially released, Im hesitant to use that approach or JNI libraries. p  pMuch appreciated p  pEDIT It appear file polling is the way to go.

Negative 30408 pI am using windows xp x86, wamp, apache2, php 5.3 x86, eclipse php, and xdebug, running on localhost as both a virtualhost and an https virtualhostp  peclipse version infobr Eclipse for PHP Developers Version Helios Release Build id 201006171415p  pI had successfully managed, somehow, to setup eclipse and xdebug and all was well.p  pThen I had to make an svn branch of my project, and reconfigure apache with 2 new virtual hosts, and update my windows host files.p  pNow when I launch debug mode in eclipse everything dies.p  pSpecifically, If I set no breakpoints the app runs fine, save for the problem Im trying to debug in the first place.p  pIf I set a breakpoint, the app stops at the breakpoint, and eclipse appears to be holding the ball.  But now, when I press continue, or step over, or step into, or sneeze, eclipse tells me execution has resumed, but the application continues to hang, and I have to restart apache.  p  pI suspect that there is some break in the communication between eclipse and xdebug, because it looks to me like eclipse is sending my continue or step over command, but xdebug is not receiving it.p  pBut even if thats the case I dont know what to do about it.  Where should I be lookingp  pUpdatebr I have successfully been able to debug using notepad, its xdebug plugin, and, like a caveman, typing ampXDEBUGSESSIONSTARTsessionname into the url.  However, despite my love for npp, its debug plugin is quite buggy...p  pSo I noticed an ad on stackoverflow for something called phpstorm, which professed to be a lightweight yet full featured php ide, with native xdebug support.  The demo required a restart to get it to work, and it feels kind of like working on a wobbly draft table, but it managed to debug both my small test app and real app very nicely, which is more than I can say for eclipse at the moment, even though its probably my fault.p  pI probably should have posted this earlier   Here is my phpinfo xdebug sectionp  precodexdebug xdebug support  enabled Version

I think this problem has something to do with when the query actually executes and it may have to do with the filters I am applying to the query see below.p  pUser Layer Codep  precodegrdSelectedQuestionaires.DataSource  assessment.FilteredAssessmentListfilter grdSelectedQuestionaires.DataBind lt Fails  Cannot access a disposed object codepre  pBusiness Layer Codep  precodepublic IQueryableltAssessmentgt FilteredAssessmentListAssessmentSearchFilter filter              using PAQcDataLayerDataContext dc  new PAQcDataLayerDataContext                      var rows                       from a in dc.vPAQSummaries                     select new Assessment                                              PAQNumber  a.PAQNumber.Trim,                         CustomerID  inta.CustomerID,                         Department  a.Department.Trim,                         CustomerName  a.CustomerName.Trim,                         DOTNumber  a.DOTNumber.Trim,                         OrgName  a.OrgName.Trim,                         DateEntered  a.DateEntered,                         GroupNumber  a.GroupNumber.Trim,                         JobTitle  a.JobTitle.Trim,                         FileNames  a.FileNames.Trim,                         AnalystType  a.AnalystType.ToString,                         Incumbents  a.Incumbents,                                     Filter by Customer ID             if filter.CustomerID gt 0                              rows  rows.Wherer gt r.CustomerID  filter.CustomerID                          else                              rows  rows.Wherer gt r.CustomerID  null                             Filter by DOT Number             if string.IsNullOrEmptyfilter.DOTNumberFrom                              if string.IsNullOrEmptyfilter.DOTNumberTo                                      rows  rows.Wherer gt r.DOTNumber  filter.DOTNumberFrom                                  else                                      rows  rows.Wherer gt r.DOTNumber.CompareTofilter.DOTNumberFrom gt 0                         ampamp r.DOTNumber.CompareTofilter.DOTNumberTo lt 0                                              Filter by OrgName             if string.IsNullOrEmptyfilter.OrgName                              rows  rows.Wherer gt r.OrgName.StartsWithfilter.OrgName                             Filter by Group             if string.IsNullOrEmptyfilter.GroupNumberFrom                              if string.IsNullOrEmptyfilter.GroupNumberTo                                      rows  rows.Wherer gt r.GroupNumber  filter.GroupNumberFrom                                  else                                      rows  rows.Wherer gt r.GroupNumber.CompareTofilter.GroupNumberFrom gt 0                         ampamp r.GroupNumber.CompareTofilter.GroupNumberTo lt 0                                            if filter.Skip gt 0                              rows  rows.Skipfilter.Skip                          if filter.Take gt 0                              rows  rows.Takefilter.Take                          else                              rows  rows.Take100                           return rows.Distinct                codepre

Here I dont need any info.  li liA third vendor needs username and password of the account.li ul  pIn the spirit of not allowing incomplete objects, I added these as parameters to the constructors of the concrete implementations.p  pNow, I am not sure, how this would work. Clearly, these additional parameters do not belong into the interface, because they are specific to each implementation.br On the other hand, these additional parameters need to be entered by the enduser and then passed to the implementation of codeITradingApicode, meaning that the user of codeITradingApicode needs intimate knowledge about the concrete implementation.br How to solve this dilemmap  pstrongUPDATEstrongbr One approach could be to create an codeITradingApiProvidercode that exposes a list of required parameters. The View could automatically create an input form for these parameters that is databound to the parameters in codeITradingApiProvidercode. Now, when an codeITradingApicode instance is requested from the provider, it can make use of these parameters to create an instance of the concrete implementation. Clearly the implementation of codeITradingApiProvidercode and codeITradingApicode are tightly coupled, but I think that is not a problem as long as each implementation of codeITradingApicode comes with a corresponding implementation of codeITradingApiProvidercode.p

Negative 30408 pRight now, if you have a test that looks like thisp  precode[TestMethod] [DeploymentItemDataSource.csv] [DataSource     Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.DataSource.CSV,      DataSource.csv,      DataSourcecsv,      DataAccessMethod.Sequential] public void TestSomething      string data  TestContext.DataRow[ColumnHeader].ToString           do something with the data       codepre  pYoull get as many tests runs as you have data values when you execute this test.p  pWhat Id like to do is duplicate this kind of behaviour in code while still having a datasource.

The data in the external file will be pulled in via the deployment items in the code.testsettingscode for the test run, because they can and will be defined differently for each person running the tests and I dont want to force a rebuild of the test code in order to run the tests, or explode the number of data files for tests. Each test mightshould be able to specify which locations it would like to test against the types are known at compiletime, not the physical locations.p  pLikewise, creating a test for each deployment location isnt possible because the deployment locations can and will be dynamic in location, and in quantity.p  pCan anyone point me to some info that might help me solve this problem of minep

I have numerous divs each of which has a unique id that Im frequently updating e.g., with innerHTML, or modifying e.g., style attributes with webkit transitions and transforms.p  pIn general  am I better off using getElementByID each time I need a handle to a div, or should I store references to each div I access in global variables at the startp  pI use global in quotes because Ive really just got one truly strongglobalstrong variable  its an object that stores all my global variables as properties.p  pI assume using getElementByID each time must have some overhead, since the function needs to traverse the DOM to find the div. But, Im not sure how taxing or efficient this function is.p  pUsing global variables to store handles to each element must consume some memory, but I dont know if these references require just a trivial amount of RAM, or more than that.p  pSo  which is better Or, do both options consume such a trivial amount of resources that I should just worry about which produces more readable, maintainable codep  pMany thanks in advancep

Negative 30408 pI am working on a tool to compare two wave files for similarity in their waveforms. Ex, I have a wave file of duration 1min and i make another wave file using the first one but have made each 5sec data at an interval of 5sec to 0. Now my software will tell that there is waveform difference at time interval 5sec to 10sec, 15sec to 20sec, 25sec to 30 sec and so on...p  pAs of now, with initial development, this is working fine. Following are 3 test setsp  ol lipI have two wave files with sampling rate of 960Hz, mono, with no of data samples as 138551 arnd 1min 12sec files. I am using 128 point FFT splitting file in 128 samples chunk and results are good.pli lipWhen I use the same algorithm on wave files of sampling rate 48KHz, 2channel with no of data samples 6927361 for each channel arnd 2min 24 sec file, the process becomes too slow. When I use 4096 point FFT, the process is better.pli lipBut, the 4096 point FFT on files of 22050Hz, 2channels with number of data samples 55776 for each channel arnd 0.6sec file gives very poor results. In this case 128 point FFT gives good result.pli ol  pSo, I am confused on how to decide the length of FFT so that my results are good in each case.p  pI guess the length should depend on number of samples and sampling rate. Please give your inputs on this.p  pThanksp

Negative 30408 pIve been doing a bit of research on the subject, and Im a little confused about storing cookies within an iOS app. I want to be able to store a users login credentials so that they dont have to log in every time they launch the app much like Facebooks app does.

Is this possible p  pIn other words, is there a way I can associate the codeEnginecode of codePetrolCarcode to be a codePetrolEnginecode In the above case, it is creating two separate instance variables codeenginecode, one of codePetrolEnginecode type inside codePetrolCarcode, and another codeEnginecode, which I can access as codesuper.getEnginecode from inside codePetrolCarcode.

Negative 30408 pI have made a kind of CMS using CodeIgniter. It loads the page content from Database depending on the codeslugcode text passed in the URL parameter like e.g. about, services, contact.p  pIn the controller code, I have remapped the index method to take the slug as parameter to it as default index methods dont allow parameters.  Check the code of my codepagecode controller on the link below p  pa hrefhttppastebin.comMwsVzRwQ relnofollowhttppastebin.comMwsVzRwQap  pThe way this works is, I have set codepagecode controller to load as default.

Negative 30408 pIm looking into getting some advice on organizing the timeseries information into the database. My current implementation is PostgreSQL with single table for all symbols. It is slow on getting customized information but very easy to append. Based on the information from a hrefhttpdba.stackexchange.comquestions7634timeseriessqlornosqlherea I wanted to replicate the structure of the database with creating a separate table per symbol. After thinking about it more careful I realized that it would be a bit hard for me to query multiple symbols based on some criteria like p  precodeSELECT  FROM allsymbols WHERE closePrice gt 50 codepre  psince I would need to combine those tables somehow for the searchIt might be much easier than I think. I would also grow the number of tables by some unrealistic amount due to the fact that I record some statistical analysislike stddev per symbol per timeframe in  a separate table.p  pMy goal is to have fast and efficient database where I can read and combine the data any possible way for the analysis and research.p  pAlmost forgot to mention that I am looking into the Open Source implementation.p  pThank you in advance.p

It looks like the library will be able to do just what I want.

Negative 30408 pSince the builtin iOS UIAlertView doesnt give us the ability for skinning, Ive built my own UIAlertViewCustom class, which Im using instead.  Any of my view controller can display an instance of UIAlertViewCustom in the same that UIAlertView would be used, except my version allows for skinning graphicsfontscolors, etc.p  pMy UIAlertViewCustom class works by creating a new key window and root view controller.  I then draw my message view on this new root view controller.  The view controller that chose to display the message is seen in the background just like youd see with UIAlertView.p  pAll of this is working perfectly.  There is one piece of functionality that Id like to implement but havent figured out how to.

Of course, I want to know which orientations the view controller beneath the view controller that created the instance of UIAlertViewCustom and displayed it supports  If it supports portrait only, then I will not autorotate the UIAlertViewCustom, etc.p  pI dont want each view controller to have to pass in a supported orientation property to each instance of UIAlertViewCustom.  I would just like each instance of UIAlertViewCustom to be able to figure out if it should autorotate or not.p  pAny help would greatly be appreciatedp

Negative 30408 pI have a series of three UIWebViews, arranged sidebyside, each one sized to be full screen.p  pOne of them is current, one is next, and the last is previous.  I have each one populated with test data currently aptly named test one test two test three.  Long term Ill have more than three items to deal with.p  pSwipes cause the entire shebang to rotate left or right, displaying the next  previous item in the cycle.  The code for the rotation works, as far as I can tell, correctly.  Current takes on the frame of previous, previous takes on nexts frame, and next takes on the frame of current.  I then adjust the pointers so that current is pointed to next which is now placed as current and so on.  Sounds more complicated than it really isp  precodecode to animate this process properly ommited previous.hidden1 CGrect tempFramecurrent.frame current.frameprevious.frame previous.framenext.frame next.frametempFrame previous.hidden0  Adjust the actual pointers so they accurately describe their current positions UIWebView tempcurrent currentprevious previousnext nextcurrent codepre  pMy only issue is that the web views if you go 2 or more in a given direct slide in blank.  E. G. swipe right and you go from test 1 to test 2.  Swipe right again, and you get a blank screen.  THe frames are all correct, the webview is placed correctly, but its contents are blank.p  pConfusing thing is, if you swipe once in the opposite direction, and then back, it displays properly.  E. g. swipe three right, you have a blank swipe left then back right, and it displays the correct screen.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas what could possibly be causing this  I suspect that once I go to my next step real data where next  previous is loaded with the appropriate item when its slid in itll cause the current issue to vanish, but I want to understand THIS issue.p  pEditp  pIve managed to trace the issue, partially, to my hiding the panel that should NOT be visible.

Negative 30408 pI have a large, complex dataset that I want to allow users to filter.  Rather than a large screen of parameters for input, I am envisioning a filter box on the left side of the page that includes a small box for each filter that has been added.  The user can choose from a set of available filters each with different parameters, get a modal dialog box for detailed info, and have that new filter show up in the filter box.  Removing a filter would be possible by clicking a close box on each added filter.  Each of these actions would need to hit the server as well to store the filters in a user session and to actually filter the dataset on the main view window.  p  pI am looking for suggestions on tips for implementing this and not so much on what javascript library is good for that.  That said, I am coding the backend with mongodb and python Flask.  Currently, I am using jQuery and DataTable.p

Negative 30408 pI want to create a codeDictionarycode that maps a codeTypecode to an codeActioncode, but I want the keys to be types that come from a specific parent class. So I want to do something likep  precodeclass Container      private DictionaryltType, Actiongt dict      public void AddActionType t, Action a where t  typeofSomeParentClass              dict[t]  a       codepre  pWhere the codeAddActioncode method only accepts values of codetcode that are types of classes that are subclasses of some specific class. Ive seen something like this done in Java with the codeextendscode keyword, but I cant figure out how to do this in C, if its even possible.p  pEdit To clarify, I dont want the AddAction method to take an instance of SomeParentClass, but rather the Type of a class that is a subclass of SomeParentClass. Is there maybe a better way than using Typesp  pEdit What Im essentially trying to do is create a dispatching service, wherein various parts of the app can register interest in an Event type and provide an Action that is called when an event of that type is fired. So imagine something likep  precodeservice.RegisterInteresttypeofMyEvent, myAction codepre  pWhere codemyActioncode is of type codeActionltMyEventgtcode something I didnt put in the original post but should have instead of a plain codeActioncode.p  pThen some other part of the app can dop  precodeservice.TriggerEventtypeofMyEvent codepre  pWhich causes all codeActionltMyEventgtcode instances registered as above to be called...So in fact that codeDictionarycode maps a codeTypecode to a codeListltActionltEventgtgtcode, not a single codeActioncode.p

Negative 30408 pI am running some shell test scripts from a python script under Windows. The shell scripts are testing the functionality of various modules.p  pThe problem that I faced is that some scripts can hang. For this I added a timeout for each script. This timeout has a default value. But this timeout value can be changed by the bash script  from a bash function  SetMaxTime   I can modify SetMaxTime.p  pWhen the default value is used I wait for that period of time in python and if the bash script is not done I will consider that test as failed due to timeout.p  pThe problem is when the default value of timeout is changed from bash. Is there a way to communicate with a bash script ran with mingw from pythonp  pNOTE The scripts are ran under Windows.p

Update the old version of each updated or deleted document as     madeobsoletebytransaction with the transaction id.    This is the time to detect conflicts if seen a conflict, rollback.    Note  this can be done as findandmodify rather then by serializing the entire document again. 5. Remove the transaction record.  Cleanup process 1. Go over transaction record, sorted by id, ascending oldest transaction first. 2. For each transaction, if it expired by timestamp, do rollbacktxid.  Rollbacktxid process 1. Get the transaction record for the given transaction id. 2. For each document id in the updated documents     2.1 If the document exists and has madeobsoletebytransaction with          the correct transaction id, remove the madeobsoletebytransaction data. 3. For each document with the createdbytransactionid     3.1 remove the document. 4. Remove the transaction record document.  Retrieval process 1. Toptransactionid  transaction ID counter. 2. Read all transactions from the transactions collection.     Currenttransactionids[]  Get all transaction IDs. 3. Retrieve documents as needed. Always use sort by transactionid, desc as last sort clause.     3.1 If a document createdbytransactionid is in the Currenttransactionids[]          or is gt Toptransactionid  ignore it not yet committed.     3.2 If a document madeobsoletebytransaction is not in the Currenttransactionids[]          and is lt Toptransactionid  ignore it a newer version was committed. 4. We may have to retrieve more chunks to satisfy original requests if documents were ignored. codepre  pWas the document committed when we startedbr If we see a document with transaction ID in the current executing transactions  its a transaction that started before we started the retrieval but was not yet committed at that time  so we dont want it. If we see a document with transaction ID  top transaction ID  its a transaction that started after we started the retrieval  so we dont want it.p  pIs the document uptodate latest versionbr If we see a document with madeobsolete that is not in the current transaction IDs transactions started  before we started and is lt top transaction ID transactions started after we started  then there was a transaction that finished commit in our past that made this document obsolete  so we dont want it.p  pWhy is sorting not harmedbr Because we add the sort as a last clause, well always see the real sorting work first. For each real  sorting bucket we might get multiple documents that represent the model object at different versions. However, the sort order between model objects remains.p  pWhy doesnt the counter makes the transaction execute serially one at ta timebr Because this is not RDBMS  we dont really have transactions so we dont wait for the transaction  to commit as we do with select for update. Another transaction can make the atomic change as soon as were done with it.p  pCompactionbr One in a while a compaction will have to take place  get all really old documents and remove them to another data store. This shouldnt affect any running retrieval or transaction.p  pOptimizationp  ol liPut the conditions into the query itself.li liAdd transaction ID to all indexes.li liMake sure documents with the same model object ID dont get sharded into different nodes.li ol  pWhats the costbr Assuming we want multiple document versions for history and audit anyway, the extra cost is  atomically updating the counter, creating the transaction record, sealing the previous version of each model object mark obsolete and removing the transaction document. This shouldnt be too big. Note that if the above assumption is not valid, the extra cost is quite high, especially for retrieval.p  hr  pResultsp  pIve implemented the above algorithm the revised one with minor changes. Functionally, its working. However, the performance at least over MongoDB with 3 nodes in masterslave replication topology, no fsync but replication required before commit ends is atrocious. Im constantly reading things Ive just written to from different threads. Im getting constant collection locks on the transactions collection and my indexes cant keep up with the constant rollover. Performance is capped at 20 TPS for tiny tiny transactions with 10 feeder threads.p  pIn short  not a good general purpose solution.p

Negative 30408 pIm trying to add authentication to my Expressbased server. I am noticing some strange behavior of the routing.p  pIve distilled the problem to this Express codep  precodeapp.get, function req, res      console.logthis is reached first     res.sendHello   app.get, function req, res      console.logthis is not reached   app.get, function req, res      console.logthis is reached  codepre  pUpon requesting  the 1st handler is called. It provides a response and does not call next. Therefore I am surprised to see that the 3rd handler  is also called Another surprise is that the response res passed to the 3rd handler is not the same as the one passed to the first handler. If I were to call next from the 1st handler then the 2nd handler would be called, and with the same response object.p  pNow for my real scenario I want to process requests and verify authentication in a global manner. Some routes, however, should remain available for nonauthenticated users. I based my solution on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7951810checkeachnodejsrequestforauthenticationcredentialsZikes answera. I routed the free paths first. Then I included an route handler for all . It would call next if the user is authenticated or nexterr otherwise. Following are all the restricted routes. And finally, my own error handler using app.use. It looks something like thisp  precodeapp.useapp.router app.usefunctionerr, req, res, next      console.logAn error occurred   err     res.send401, Unauthorized   app.get, function req, res      res.sendHello all   app.all, function req, res, next      if req.user          next  authorized      else          nextnew Error401  unauthorized        app.getmembers, function req, res      res.sendHello member  codepre  pThis works rather well, blocking access to members. However, it has bug the authentication check and error handling happens even when accessing the nonrestricted path . After the intended response is sent, the error handler tries to send a 401 error response. The latter does not get sent, but the code should not run.p  pAlso, a side effect of this mechanism is that unauthenticated users get an 401 error for nonexisting pages. I may want to return a 404 in some of those cases. But now Im just pushing it...p  pI kinda have 2 questionsp  ol liIs this behavior a bug Should the general handler be called without next being calledli liWhat would be a good solution for hooking many but not all routes, without having to mark them individuallyli ol

With that very versionstrong and maybe earlier releases, strongthe code with codefinal myArraycode runs slower than the one without this keyword 2671ms vs 2331ms on a basis of 200 iterations.strongp

Negative 30408 pId like to sync between the internal Android calendar and my application.

Negative 30408 pI support an old, very large app with antiquated tabs, tree views, context menus, and a frameset.  It is laid out with navigation tabs and tree views in a left frame and a data entry frame on the right.  It is totally reliant on IE Quirks Mode.p  pThis app is so big that a total rewrite in one hit is not feasible, so I have been investigating options for incremental updates.  The most obvious I thought was loading modern MVCHTML5 etc screens in the right data entry frame.  I have had considerable success with this except that I cannot get the screens to run in IE9 Document Mode.  If I load the modern screens independent of the old frameset they run in IE9 Document Mode no problems, but when loaded in the frameset they drop back to IE8 Document Mode.  I have tried all sorts of meta tag and http header directives with no luck.  This is not necessarily a showstopper but is there any way to solve this  I thought it might be related to frames being obsolete in HTML5p  pThanksp

Negative 30408 pI have a mobile singlepage web application that is built using jquerymobile jqm and knockout. The application itself has multiple pages but they are all contained within a single HTML document. p  pProblem after changing my create view model for page from sync to async behavior, I have the problem that jquerymobile fires its events before the data is ready.p  pBackground up until recently I had been working with sample data, basically a huge JSON blob, and everything worked smoothly. With the new async composition of view models from various sources, data is not ready immediately and my buildViewModel method takes a continuation callback instead of just synchronously returning data.p  pIm subscribing to the pagebeforecreate and pagebeforechange events, and fire off the code to populate the viewmodel here. The problem is that after returning from the event handler, jqm triggers the remaining chain of events before the data is available. This causes a page transition to an unprepared page, which is undesirable.p  pI have tried to call codeevent.preventDefaultcode in all of the beforeevents and manually calling .mobile.changePage once the page is ready to be a enhanced and b the page transition to occur, but without any luck.p  pIve scanned the jquerymobile source, but couldnt spot anything that looked like it would allow me to delay the codepagebeforeshowcode event, which is essentially what I need in order to be able to render the page properly.p  pHow can I ensure that 1 data is available and 2 knockout has been applied to perform initial DOM manipulations, before jquerymobile attempts to enhance the page and before it executes the intransition to the page p  pI also considered using synchronous ajax to fetch resources, but this will I think not work for resources loaded from the device using PhoneGapCordova, and has other negative consequences that Id like to avoid.p  pFWIW, Id like to avoid having to manually handle all navigation events by wiring up clickhandlers everywhere, but Im open to all solutions if need be.p  pApologies if this is a duplicate Ive searched and read a ton of questions, but not found an answer or question that was quite the same.

Also messages created by users are encrypted by RSA  AES. p  psending message looks likep  ol liClient connects to server.li liThey establish secure connection server sends its public key, client generates AES key encrypts it via servers public key and send it to server. After that server and client uses AES key to communicate. li liClient create message in XML, message can contain files which are read to base64 and after that they are encrypted with AES.li liThe message is written to db.li ol  precieving message look likep  ol liConnection to server.li liEstablish secure connection.li liGet messages from server.li liDecrypt AES key using RSA private key.li liDecrypt message using decrypted AES key.li liIf there are files then decrypt them using AES and base64decode them to bytes and save.li ol  pNow the problem is with encryption of large data.

Negative 30408 pI have been scouring forums and repository pattern blogs for some clear direction on how I should be coding my project and Im stuck. Any help or guidance from you guys would be much approciated p  pI started my project as EF5 MVC4 Razor Code First and decided to use MVCScaffolding to generate all my controllers, views and repositories. This was my first project with these technologies, I was just told that this was how the team was doing it now but the previous developers did model first and hand coded their contexts.p  pSO, all is great, were coding a bunch of screens, but one of our screens is a complex one that involves many modelssub modlels ie Object model has FKs to Responses, Attachments, Reviewers, etc.... The user adds a bunch of data, selects one or more reviewers, adds 0 or more attachments. Then they hit Savep  pNow my big problem is that I want to save all this data as one transaction, and if something fails on one of the children models ie attachments the transaction will roll back. strongHoweverstrong, the way the MVCScaffolding repositories are created, each model has its own instance of DB Context and its own Save. And the controllers accept each unique repository as parameters for loading the screen data. Another thing to note is for this screen we are using a ViewModel to load the data, and then wrote custom mappers to map back to the different models for saving. We can save each piece separately, and possibly the solution is just to wrap TransactionScope around my save, but I also want to reduce the number of calls to the db, as each repository save does a call.p  pI thought I could add code to the parent repository for a UnitsOfWork type save that would addedit all the child obejcts in one context object, but that seems like a hack more than anything, and I want to code this properly. p  pOne of the other projects here just made a custom DB context and all Save methods were in that class, is that the best way to do it Another dev did code first but hand coded all his Save methods. None of them are in a standard place and he is using TransactionScope with a DBContext inside is that overkill or does DBContext not handle transactionsp  pSince Im so new to this, I need help and no one I work with seems to agree on a proper method. Im not sure if my model is wrong for an MVC App since Im such a database heavy thinker.p  pBelow is a sample of my models, any guidance is appreciated.

Negative 30408 pHey guys I am trying to write a pretty simple JSON delete function and I am recursively traversing the JSON. When I find a key value pair match I want to delete the pair in the JSON and return true for that the pair was found a deleted. The issue I am having is the return does not go all the way up the recursion stack. I realize I cannot just do this... p  precodereturn true codepre  pbut I do not want to return the whole function. Do I need to do something like thisp  precodereturn this.true codepre  pI also want to break the recursion after a KV pair match is found instead of continuing the search the rest of the JSON. Currently it is continuing through the rest of the JSON. Is it possible to break the recursion after a match is found p  pHere is some code, the hopefully makes it more clear. p  precodedeleteItems function toDelete      self  this     var keys  toDelete.find.key     var vals  toDelete.find.val      for var i  0 i lt keys.length i          .eachthis.json, function key, val              console.logkeys[i].value      vals[i].value                    function removedelKey, delVal, o          console.logdelKey      delVal         for var key in o              if typeof o[key]  object                  console.logkey    [                 removedelKey, delVal, o[key]              else                  if delKey  key ampamp delVal  o[key]                      console.logdelete match   delKey      delVal   ,   key      o[key]                     delete this item.                      return true                                                  console.logremovekeys[0].value, vals[0].value, this.json , codepre  pAlso if anyone else has an easier way to delete a KV pair from JSON using javascript I would love to hear it, there has to be an easier way then simply traversing the entire thing and delete the KV pair. And now actually looking at this I do not think it is going to work for nested object lists. for example if the KV pair is nested in the objects I do not think I can do delete json[key], I would need to keep track of the keys for the objects about it so it would need to be, delete json.obj1.obj2[key]. p  pThanks in advance for the help with the recursion and the tangent about deleting from JSON. p

Now Im not sure wether it is a problem of the wrong name of the accompanying myname.lib file renaming didnt help or if there is something different wrong.p  pIm not an expert in .NET but as I testet with a VB.NET dll which I built myself with a proper name alle worked well.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 30408 pI need to write a function say codefun1code that has one argument, because it will be used in other function codefun2code. The latter requires a function with a single argument. However, I need to pass other parameters to function codefun1code. How can I do this in Python without using global variables Or this is the only way p  pAddition  If it is important, codefun2code is some optimization function from codescipy.optimizecode. Below is an example of passing additional parameter codeccode to function codefun1code using codeglobalcode. In the first call, function codefun2code takes codefun1code as codex1code, but in the second call, codefun1code is codex2code. I would like to make similar, but without using codeglobalcode. Hopefully, the example clarifies the question. The example is changed.p  precodedef fun1x     global c    return  x  c  def fun2f1, x     return  f1x   main program global c x0 1   c 1   y fun2fun1, x0  printy     gives 2 c 2   y fun2fun1, x0  printy     gives 3 codepre

Negative 30408 pCurrently I have a c tcpclient and a c tcpserver, but I can only read chars from the stream at the server side thus all the data will be casted to char.

At this point I use tmuxs search mode to isolate the signature of the function codedifflinesToCharsMungecode and you see what I have pasted there is the beginning portion of the functions signature, which is enough to get gdb to happily set a breakpoint on it. p  pNow Id like to make this somewhat better, but Im not sure how.

The import method initially takes requests thru the controller but then calls model methods where appropriate for db and file system level logic and operations. And yes I do have other import model classes dedicated for this purpose, mostly because of behaviorrelated memory leaks in Yii. p  pThe idea that one should not do any logic in a controller is just wrong, imo. In this case Ive chosen to make import methods in controllers that do some input filtering logic, because there are a large number of inputs that the user human or cron needs to submit, and this needs to occur before we get to the task of parsing files into the db.  This controller import method parses files based on user input and passes the prefiltered data to the model method.  Ive chosen to do this because file input data is actually untrusted user input and I needed to do some preprocessing based on the user request params.  Yes you could do this in a model method, but it would result in either processing request data in the model, or passing a large number of arguments and data around, which is a hassle and increases memory usage.   p

Negative 30408 pIn a hrefhttplabs.spotify.com20130618creativeusernames relnofollowa semirecent bug disclosurea, spotify talks about how users used a glitch in the username normalization code to gain access to accounts which they did not own. The problem was that they were applying a nonidempotent operation to the usernames to check if they were taken, so  and BIGBIRD were separate usernames when they shouldnt be.p  pI would like to allow Unicode usernames for my web site, but I do not want to be vulnerable to these kind of attacks. I do not use Python, so I cannot use the solution they proposed on their website. Is there any kind of idempotent formula, that can be used on any platform i.e. python, ruby, lua, javascript, .NET, etc supporting Unicode operations, which will treat two Unicode strings that have only visual differences the same string Is it as simple as NKFD  lowercasing the stringp

Negative 30408 pSo far Ive made dozens of apps which use database. I did not go too deep into database logic and how to structure it, but made it as simple as possible and by the rules. p  pFor example, my database logic usually consists of one database class which extends codeSQLiteOpenHelpercode. Then I make CRUD methods for each table. Each time I have to deal with a database, I make a special codeAsyncTaskcode and within it deal with the database. And this is it. p  pTalking to some developers, I was told that my logic structure should be more complex, more OOP. I tried finding samples on the net but they all were directed towards explaining how to deal with the database. I even reviewed some open source projects but they had the logic similar to mine. p  pCan you help me How should I make database logic more OOP I guess they mentioned that I should be able to reuse this logic in the future, changing only the lowest part which deals with a specific database and its tables. p

Negative 30408 pHere is the scenario 1. Lets say I have a lot of partners, each partner has its own website 2. I provide all partners a piece of javascript code, this javascript will call my WCF using jQuery and Jsonp 3. Each partner add a link to their home page, and include this javascript 4. A useranyone go to PartnerAs web site, and click the link, this will trigger the javascript and call my WCFp  pMy question is, how can I get the calls domain name or ip address That is to say, I have to distinguish different biz logic.p  pRequest.referrer cannot, because not all browsers supports it. I dont want the javascript pass domain name or ip address to my WCF, because javascript is in client side, that means everyone can use the same code calling my service, that will spoil my business logic.p  pIs there any backend solutions to do thatp  pThank you.p
Negative 30408 pI am building a library for Windows Phone 8 which requires local databases. For obvious reasons, user of the library is going to create a mappable LINQtoSQL class with appropriate code[Table]codes and code[Column]codes. However, To in every such class, I need a few more columns for internal functioning of the library. The idea was that I would include a base class in the library which will have members corresponding to the required columns. The user would simply inherit from this class, add his own members and use that class as final LINQtoSQL map.p  pSo far, my base class looks like thisp  precodeClass to contain all the essential members [Table] public class SyncableEntityBase  NotifyBase, ISyncableBase      [ColumnDbType  INT NOT NULL IDENTITY, IsDbGenerated  true, IsPrimaryKey  true]     public int ItemId  get set       [Column]     public bool IsDeleted  get set       [Column]     public DateTime RemoteLastUpdated  get set       [Column]     public DateTime LocalLastUpdated  get set          codepre  pAnd the derived class, something like thisp  precode[Table] public class ToDoCategory  SyncableEntityBase      private string categoryName     [Column]     public string CategoryName              get                      return categoryName                  set                      if categoryName  value                              NotifyPropertyChangingCategoryName                 categoryName  value                 NotifyPropertyChangedCategoryName                                 private string categoryColor     [Column]     public string CategoryColor              get                      return categoryColor                  set                      if categoryColor  value                              NotifyPropertyChangingCategoryColor                 categoryColor  value                 NotifyPropertyChangedCategoryColor                             codepre  pIdea is to have final class with the four essential columns and two added by user. According to MSDN documentation a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryvstudiobb39935228vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowherea, I need to append code[InheritanceMapping]code which requires the inherited type. However, as I am building a library, I have no way to know what types and how many the user will derive from my base class. Is there any way around this Howp

Negative 30408 pin my storage data model I got the following relationsp  proottbl  1n  entrytbl  n1  actiontblp  pThere are a few more tables but this covers the basics. Alright, so basically one ID from the root table has several datasets in the entry table.p  pExample datap  precoderoottbl  IDroot  Country  FKUser  FKProduct       1       UK       23       31       2       NL       42       01   entrytbl  IDentry  FKroot  FKAction  Duration        1        1         42  200ms        2        1         10  94ms        3        1          9  300ms        4        2         10  322ms        5        2         30  100ms codepre  pSo far so good ... with this data model it is pretty easy to answer things like how many records have UK as country with action 10 and so on. Now I would like to put this data into a fact table but my problem are the relations of these three tables. For example would I use the records of entrytbl as fact than I would have to do a select distinct on ID everytime I count country, user or product.p  pThe fact table would look more or less like this just imagine the strings as foreign keys p  precodefacttbl  ID  FKAction  Duration  Country  User  Product 1          42     200ms       UK    23       31 1          10      94ms       UK    23       31 1           9     300ms       UK    23       31 2          10     322ms       NL    42       01 2          30     100ms       NL    42       01 codepre  pThis means I would have a lot of redundant data.p  pAre there any way around these solution The fact table would contain  300  500m rows.p  pI hope you got my point.

I have seen some things being talked about html5 using a new file search function but that sounds more like for finding particular files rather then taking the entire components of a folder into an array.p  pEdited 12232013 Per PHPGlue Request and help.p  pSo far the code that I have played with arep  pTest html Main Page          p  precodeltheadgt ltmeta contenttexthtml charsetutf8 httpequivContentType gt lttitlegtBasic XHTML Documentlttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt  ltpgtPresident Obama is from Hawaiiltpgt  ltpgtltimg idscroller alt srcpicstest.jpg width600 height400gtltpgt    ltscript typetextjavascript srccommon.jsgtltscriptgt   ltscript typetextjavascript srcpicsimagefun.phpgtltscriptgt ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre  pcommon js File in main directory with main pagep  precode common.js lt[CDATA[ var doc  document, bod  doc.body, IE  parseFloatnavigator.appVersion.splitMSIE[1] function gteIEversion, className   ifIE gt version     bod.className  className     function Ee   return doc.getElementByIde  ]]gt   codepre  pFinally I have 2 pictures in a picture folder along with a imagefun php file.p  precode imagefun.php ltphp imgs  implodearraymergeglob.png, glob.jpg, ,  echo lt[CDATA[ var imgs  [imgs], ni, iA  [] forvar i in imgs   ni  new Image ni.src  imgs[i] iA[i]  ni  var pre  onload, iN  0, iL  imgs.length1, imgElementId  Escroller imgElementId.src  imgs[0] onload  function   ifprepre   imgElementId.src  iA[0]   setIntervalfunction     ifiN gt iLiN  0     imgElementId.src  iA[iN]   , 2000  ]]gt gt codepre  pPHPGlue Thank you for all the time that you have put into this. Really not trying to be a pain at all and I really do appreciate all of your patience. I have made sure to swap names based on my file structures. Based on what I see for the basic ideas of the code I would think it should work. As I said though when I load to test it, it will only show the picture I defaulted on the load and then never change. One thing that I have noticed is that if you take the code of the imaage fun php code and run just that, all it returns is an output of ILiN  0 imgElement.src  iA[iN] , 2000  ]]   If I am right then that string of output should be similar to the whole thing rather then just a fragment of a line like it is. I do believe if I am understanding the goal of this code we are having it spit out some code into the src location of the picture locationp  pUltimately if possible I would like to have a cloud based file location that I could use to have an individual who works here store pictures in that file and then have the website pull all files in that location to be loaded to the page one at a time at an interval of about 15000 ms. I would appreciated any comments or recommendations.p
Negative 30408 pIn Magento we had a problem with extremely fast changing stocklevels amp deliverytimes of products originating from a variety of suppliers. We have over 400k products in catalogue, and about 50150k changes in stocklevels every day, with popular products having hourly changes  there was no way Magento could keep up with this in a timely manner.p  pWe solved most of this problem using direct sql in the product list list.phtml, view view.phtml and in the shoppingcart. This extremely simple query accesses  if needed  the table in our DB that holds the stocklevels, productstatus and deliverytimes for each product and displays this next to the product to assure we display accurate stock amp deliverytime information to our custmers.p  pqueryp  precodequery  SELECT externalstock, productstatus, deliveryperiod FROM productssupplierstatus WHERE skusku  data  MagegetSingletoncoreresourcegtgetConnectioncorereadgtfetchAllquery  codepre  pWith php we loop through the status amp stocklevels and depending a few factors we display a tekst that informs the customer about the expected deliverytime of this product.p  pSo far, so good  Always worked like a charm and solved our problem.p  pHowever, we decided to combine these routine in a simple module, so we can always call the same block, and we would be able to manage changes for deliverytimes more easily in 1 place instead of 3.p  pSounded easy enough so we created a small module and called this in the list amp view pagesp  precodeltphp echo thisgtgetLayoutgtcreateBlockdynamicdeliverygtsetDataprodid, productgtgetIdgtsetTemplatedvdoshowdelivery.phtmlgttoHtml gt  codepre  palso works great.. but mainly noticeable on the list view the loading times of the pages is much longer than it used to be.p  pWe hardly changed anything in the query or in the php that loops through the results and creates the html. Because we need nearrealtime stockinformation we do not cache these blocks.p  pWhats the reason behind this Does it take so much extra resources in Magento to build this block compared to executing nearly the same code in the phtml filep  pIf anyone can point me in the right direction to get this module working properly, I would be extremely gratefullp

Negative 30408 pIm am considering writing a queuing system on top of DynamoDB. This is not something like SQS or background processing. It is an ordered list of things employees need to process. There are named queues that contain IDs for other objects in the larger system. This part of the system only represents the queue aspect.p  pThe business model works like this. An object comes into the system and it is added to a given queue. An employee picks something off the queue. That moves the given item into the working set for a specified time. If the employee creates the task before specified time the task is completed and removed from the system. If not it is removed from the working set and added back into the main queue. There are multiple employees pulling things off the queue at once. This is happening in real human time. The system also needs to support performant size operations. This way the total jobs can be displayed in a UI.p  pIm considering DynamoDB because this is the most critical process in the company. DynamoDB has guaranteed performance and scalability. We have an infrastructure problem right now because independent system are not built on top of infrastructure suiting their needs. So Ive arrived here.p  pI have played with DyanmoDB before but only on toy stuff. This is the real deal. I cannot figure out how to take this business model and map to DynamoDB. The naive approach would be to take a document like thisp  precode            queue high,        jobs [1,2,3,4,5,6]      codepre  pAnd simply save that in the jobs table. I said naive because this would be wasting DynamoDBs performance abilities because strongallstrong the throughput would have to go through just a few keys there are 3 queues in practice for all reads and writes. Unfortunately I cannot come up with a complete solution.p  pMy idea was to use a composite hash key and one table to store all the queued tasks. The codequeuecode would the hash and the job position for range key. So something like thisp  precode  Hash    Range   Job    Task   high    1       55      328   low     2       15      23871   medium  1       12      38173 codepre  pAnd so on. This would distribute reads across the table. Getting the first item in the queue would be doing a query on codequeuecode and sort by coderangecode then pull out the first item. Counts work in a similar way. p  pI think the working set would work in a similar way except the hash would be a something like codequeue.jobcode. This way a codegetcode request can be made to the table to pick out an individual item. The codejobscode table may have the same requirement actually. p  pMy concern is keeping everything ordered in the jobs table. Inserting a new item would use codecount  1code for the range key. Im not sure how that would work in practice. I see a problem as queue size fluctuates. Jobs must be requeuable at the beginning as well. If they arent removed from the working set in time they must go to the front of the general queue. This could be done by using code0code for range.p  pHas anyone implemented something similar on top of DynamoDB or is my idea complete hog wash If so please tell me. I have a chance to update a business critical system and want to make this thing stable amp fast as hell since we have a lot of problems right now.p

Negative 30408 pIve been reading the JSON.NET a hrefhttpjames.newtonking.comjsonhelpindex.htmltopichtmlSerializationAttributes.htm relnofollowdocumentation on serializationa, but what Im looking for is not in their.p  pI have an application that messages over the wire that describe business transactions and queries a hrefhttpscuttingedge.itblogsstevenpivotentry.phpid91 relnofollowcommandsa and a hrefhttpscuttingedge.itblogsstevenpivotentry.phpid92 relnofollowqueriesa. Those messages are sent as JSON and we use JSON.NET to serialize and deserialize those objects. Heres an example of such objectp  precodepublic UploadDocumentCommand      public Guid DocumentId     public byte[] Data  codepre  pNow on the server we create a audit trail by simply saving these objects to a database table and we store the object in JSON format in the table.p  pAlthough most objects contain just a few bytes of data, a few of our objects contain a large amount of data, as can be seen in the previous codeUploadDocumentCommandcode example users will send files and images of multiple MBs per command. Although we do want to store those specific commands in the audit trail too we need to prevent that actual data from being serialized and stored in our database, because we will be unable to handle a database of that size.p  pUsually you would do this by marking the property or field with either an code[JsonIgnoreAttribute]code attribute or an code[NonSerialized]code attribute, byt that will not work in our case, since that would also prevent the data from being sent from client to server, since we use JSON as communication format from client to server as well.p  pIs there a way to mark these class members in a way that allows us to serialize them conditionally For instance with a custom attribute and a custom configuration in codeJsonConvert.SerializeObjectcodep

Negative 30408 pIve created a function to project a bipartite edgelist into a single mode edgelist, and everything works as it should.

Negative 30408 pIm working on a crossplatform commandline application in C on WinLinux and ObjC on OSX which emsometimesem creates an OpenGL context. The OpenGL context and window creation code is obviously different for the different platforms, but on OSX its done through codeNSOpenGLViewcode and codeNSWindowcode. Theres no nib, and its not built with Xcode it uses a crossplatform build script. p  pOn OSX, the window is created and works fine, but the OpenGL window doesnt show up in the Application Switcher codeCmdTabcode. This means that its tricky to find the window if you lose it behind other windows, and can often only be found by going to Mission ControlExpose.p  pMy question is is there a programmatic way i.e. a message to send to the codeNSWindowcode object or codeNSApplicationcode to ensure that a unixstyle command line application will show up in the codeCmdTabcode list once the window is createdp

Negative 30408 pIm trying to use Visual Studio to develop and debug a web application that uses the SharePoint 2007 API. I have been doing this fine on a 32bit server up until now.

I was told the usernamepassword for the database, but would prefer not storing the verbatim password as part of the web applications configuration.p  pDoes Microsoft SQL Server 2012 support another authentication method where I could pass e.g. some kind of service token instead from a remote not necessarily Windowsbased host, and more generally, what are best practices for storing and configuring database access configuration parameters in such a scenariop

Negative 30408 pIm using Xcode 5.1.1.     Im creating a game and using 2 view controllers. The main view controller has the games title, a NEXT button and below the title an image view of a platform that i programmed to moving back and forth. When i tap the segued NEXT it takes me to 2nd view controller which has the game. After you lose in the game, a REPLAY button pops up and a BACK button pops up. You can tap REPLAY button or tap BACK button to go back to main view controller which has the title, floating image view, and NEXT button.p  pMy problem is when im tapping on the segued BACK button to go to main view controller the image view starts moving strangely and then disappears off the screen within 5 seconds. How do i stop this from happeningp  pThink about games like Swing Copters. When you lose the game you can tap the BACK arrow and it takes you to the intro page and it has a swinging platform and the title moving up and down. My issue is my moving platform is disappearing off the screen. How do i get it to stop doing thatp

Negative 30408 pIm trying to write an app that has a menu view controller with three buttons, each corresponding to a separate view. Lets call these views v1, v2 and v3 respectively.p  pNormal operation of the app calls for random cycling through these three views, i.e. a user viewing v1 can transition to either v2 or v3. I am currently presenting these three view controllers modally by calling codeself.performSegueWithIdentifiermySegue, sender selfcode.p  pI am currently navigating around these three view controllers by modally presenting them if they are not already in the stack, or else calling codedismissViewControllerAnimatedcode on either the current view controller or its parent depending on how far up the hierarchy the desired view is.p  pThe problem with this is if the user presents all three views, resulting in a stack like  menu  v1  v2  v3 and then navigates first back to v1 and then back to v3. This causes both v3 and v2 to be dismissed and then v3 to be recreated, losing any prior interaction with these view controllers.p  pIs there any way to create a hierarchy that would function without dismissing these view controllers yet still allow navigation between any two viewsp  pEDIT Im avoiding a UITabBarController due to limits of customization, I have certain transition animations that interact with elements of my equivalent tab bar that I cant do with the preexisting class.p

Negative 30408 pI have a number of identical SQL Azure databases for like clients that need to have their versions tracked.

Negative 30408 pusing a library for docx manipulation, phpdocx.com, I stumbled upon a problem which I cant solve with my poor xpath and docx knowledge.p  pIn phpdocx, there are so called block variables which are used to mark a complete block, for examplep  precodeBLOCKfoo.bar Here comes a value BLOCKfoo.bar codepre  pIn order to locate and remove such blocks, they phpdocx use the following xpath expressionp  precodewp[wrwt[text[contains.,BLOCKfoo.bar]]] codepre  pThe respective docx snippet can be found here a hrefhttpsgist.github.comanonymous6bd998117b1a493dbaf7 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comanonymous6bd998117b1a493dbaf7ap  pSo, Ive debugged it and the above XPath query finds emoneem node, codewpcode.p  pThe first question, admittedly why does it find only one match but there are actually two the starting and the ending block. Besides, the BLOCK occurence is ripped because of that bookmark thingie. How does that work at allp  pBut the actual question I have is, I have, dont ask, a block name like codeBLOCKfoo.bar20.bazcode.p  pThe xpath for this one, respectively, is p  precodewp[wrwt[text[contains.,BLOCKfoo.bar20.baz]]] codepre  pThis does not work as expected, it finds two nodes both codewpcode though where, I crosschecked that,p  precodewp[wrwt[text[contains.,BLOCKfoo.bar20.baz]]] codepre  p..correctly works on codeBLOCKfoo.bar20.bazcode, so I, at the end, think its a problem with the occurrence of the parantheses in the expression On the other hand, the codecontainscode value is wrapped in quotes so Id say that shouldnt be a problem but Ive read that single quotes for example might also make trouble in codecontainscode expressions...p  pThe relevant PHP code block is a hrefhttpsgist.github.comanonymous490418104fdf5cd1a791 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comanonymous490418104fdf5cd1a791a. A concrete XML example can be found here, a hrefhttpgist.github.comanonymous07eeddeb7d2f3c7db55b relnofollowhttpgist.github.comanonymous07eeddeb7d2f3c7db55ba. The first block which spans from line 16 to line 74 works fine, while lines 101 till 166 doesnt, and the only difference I see are the parantheses... p  pDo you have an idea what I can do here p

Negative 30408 pI am creating a Lucene index to use as input to SemanticVectors5.4. I am indexing a list containing both bigrams and trigrams of English words. I have a frequency associated with each of the bitrigrams which I want to set as the Document frequency in Lucene. Currently I am doing this in a very inefficient way, creating X identical documents for each bitrigram where X is my associated frequency. So an example entry which I am inserting into the index is  p  blockquote   p731   academic    performancep blockquote  pWhere 731 is my frequency. At the moment I just have a forloop which would create create 731 identical documents in order for the stored frequency to be correct. This seems like a very poor method to me, but I cant find a way to manually set the document frequency in Lucene. Is there a better way to index these entries with Lucene Currently SemanticVectors cannot process the resulting Lucene index, I believe, due to its size. I have much smaller Lucene indexes correctly functioning with SemanticVectors.p

for the rest of the form that Ive not quoted in here.

I want some stuff done by GET as opposed to POST for security reasons Ive not shown that here in this example, its not relevant. As I mentioned before this is my first ajax work, so I know its not going to be pristine. Im ok about that right now and dont really want to be shown several different ways to rewrite it. I just need to know how to send back a message originating from the php that tells the html whether success of failure happened, and if failure, why. I have the respective error output divs prepared in the html and I have a span also prepared for a nice image to correspond tick or bouncy arrow to draw attention to something needing fixing. A demonstration of how to validate and send the message back  with JSON would be helpful. Ive read a lot about JSON being good for this, though Ive not got my head around it yet.p

Is this web page is good enough to be used as a web application. Is there any best practices used in this typical scenariop  pAnother approach is to have mobilefirst app serve for hybrid app , webapp  will be developed as a separate app  possibly making use of the same backend components    written for the hybrid applicationp  pPlease give me a direction p

Negative 30408 pI loop through a number of messages with an unixtime as well as an userid, where I want to find the number of messages inside a 24 hr time slot for each user. I posted my code on a hrefhttpcodereview.stackexchange.composts83410editcodereviewa to get some help. From there I optimized the               p  precodecur.executeSELECT unixtime FROM MessageType1 WHERE userID struserID[index] ORDER BY unixtime asc codepre  pquery as I found that it compromized of 6.7s of the total 7.2s running time of my code. I optimized it by making indexes on the unixtime column using codeCREATE INDEX unixtimetimes ON MessageType1 unixtime asccode. Now that query takes 0.00117s opposed to 6.7s, but the overall time it takes to run my code has gone from 7.2s to 15.8s. Everything is unchanged except for the indexes.

For example having 3rd level permission for a city and having 5th level permission for another city.p  pIs it possible to compare 2 objects as if they have numerical values For example comparing a users role against a certain level role.p  precodeif objUser.role gt userRole.userLevel3     do something  codepre  pThe permission rules are way complicated than I briefly explained.

Negative 30408 pI recently posted a question about Ninject not injecting expected strongcodeIListltTgtcodestrong upon a repository method call which returns an strongcodeIListltTgtcodestrong into a view model constructor which given answer is to inject some kind of repository or the like.p  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma29100858162167strongNinject does not trigger method when binding to methodstrongali ul  pHowever, I have already read somewhere that injecting a repository or the like into a view models constructor was considered an antipattern dont remember for what reasons, though.p  pMr. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers218136davethiebenstrongDave Thiebenstronga says that if I used the ViewModel pattern the way it is supposed to in MVC or MVP, than the view model shall have no dependencies injected into its constructor, and instead it should be filled through Property Injection from within the Controller or Presenter.p  pFollowing the rule inject exactly what that class requires to fulfill its responsibility, all what the list ViewModel needs is a list of user objects, based on whats managed. So why just not have it injected right away though Constructor Injection, instead of having it injected through Property Injectionp

Negative 30408 pI am using angular directive for date picker from UI bootstrap. I also use ngrepeat to add multiple rows. I have added date picker code in ngrepeat. I have displayed these date pickers in bootstrap modal. Also ngrepeat is work fine. But if I add multiple row and click on single calendar icon then all calendar popups of all date picker are shown. I dont know why should this happened. I use codeisopenparent.opened1code to perform click on calendar button. If I use only codeisopenopened1code then calendar popoup will open only once means can not open after selecting any date. And if I use codeisopenparent.opened1code then after adding multiple rows all calendar popup is open.

Since all of them have different attributes Ive decided to create 4 tables and link them to the codeUserscode table which will hold the login information, which is the common information between the childs. p  pMy struggle is that I cant create a child if the parent doesnt exist obviusly, but Id like to let the customers and companies register themselves, so the solution Ive come out with is inserting a new codeusercode, then get the max id from codeuserscode and insert a codecustomercode. But Im not sure if is a good approach, what happens if multiple people try to register at once p  pCould I control the parent insertion from the database instead of my code Maybe with a trigger p  pThat would make more sense to me, mainly because an user itself doesnt make any sense in my context, its either a customer, an admin or a company.p

Negative 30408 pIm trying to install quite a few modules from CPAN into a temporary directory.p  pThis is purely to place quite a few of them into a directory that I can then create a custom RPM out of.

They wont be run from this temporary location.p  pIn CPAN I have tried p  precodeo conf mbuildplarg installbase tmpperl o conf makeplarg PREFIXtmpperl codepre  pBut this seems to install them into root.cpanbuildsomenametmpperl where somename varies each time, or the usual location.

Negative 30408 pI am using the default JList model for adding elements to a JList. Occasionally when I would add an element to the model it would change the JLists visibleRowCount from 2 to 1.

Negative 30408 pIm just starting with Java and I wanted to make a little program that opens a jFrame with a text field in which you can write a number. Then you press a button and another jFrame with a jPanel, which will turn green if the number is even, and black if its odd. I edited the code of the jPanel so that the color changes depending on the number, but the problem is that it will only work once. If I write 2 and press the button, the jFrame will appear with a green panel, but then if I write another odd number and press it again, the frame will stay green. p  pHow could I solve this so that the background color changes whenever I press the button I should also say that I made an ifelse, so that you could only open the second jFrame once because I didnt know how to make it close and then open again, so maybe that has to do with the problem.

Negative 30408 pI have an application with Java Spring, mysql backend and AngularJS frontend. Its hosted on amazon ec2 m4.xlarge instance. p  pI use the HTML5 camera capture capability to take photograph and send base64 encoded image and some other metadata to backend via a RESTful web service. At the backend I convert the base64 data to a png file and save to disk and also make an entry to MySQL database about the status of the file. This has been working fine until many users start uploading images at the same time. There are 4000 users in the system and at the peak there could be around 1000 concurrent users trying to upload image data simultaneously. Having too many users slows down my application and it take 1015 seconds to return any page normally its under 2 seconds. I checked my server stats and the CPU utilization is under 20, and no SWAP memory is used. I am not sure where the bottleneck is and how to measure it. Any suggestion on how to approach the problem I know that autoscaling ec2 and having queue in image data processing at the backend might help, but before doing anything I want to get to the root cause of the problem. p  pJava code to process base64 imagep  precode   POST  restuploadstudentImage gt Upload a photo of the user and update the Student Student History and System Logs   RequestMappingvalue  restuploadstudentImage,     method  RequestMethod.POST,     produces  applicationjson Timed public Integer createRequestBody StudentPhotoDTO studentPhotoDTO      log.debugREST request to save Student  , studentPhotoDTO     Boolean success  false     Integer returnValue  0      final String baseDirectory  ApplicationsMAMPhtdocsstudentPhotos      Long studentId  studentPhotoDTO.getStudent.getStudentId      String base64Image  studentPhotoDTO.getImageData.split,[1]     byte[] imageBytes  DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binarybase64Image     try          BufferedImage image  ImageIO.readnew ByteArrayInputStreamimageBytes          String filePath  baseDirectory  somestring         log.infoSaving uploaded file to   filePath          File f  new FilefilePath         Boolean bool  f.mkdirs          File outputfile  new FilefilePath  studentId  .png         success  ImageIO.writeimage, png, outputfile       catch IOException e          success  false         e.printStackTrace      catchException ex         success  false         ex.printStackTrace           ifsuccess          returnValue  1          update student         studentPhotoDTO.getStudent.setPhotoAvailabletrue         studentPhotoDTO.getStudent.setModifiedOnnew Date          studentRepository.savestudentPhotoDTO.getStudent          return returnValue  codepre  pHere is an image of my cloudwatch network monitoringp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSaZeS.png altNetwork Inp  pUpdate 06172015 p  pI am serving the Spring Boot tomcat application with apache fronting using ajp ProxyPass.

The suggestion in that bug report to link against libatomic does not seem to work, which may be because I am still on GCC 4.7.p  pI know that I can always resort to a pthread mutex to protect the increment logic, but this is dramatically slower than taking advantage of a native instruction.p  pDo you have any recommendation on how to achieve the 64bit atomic increment in any other way for the MIPS 32bit architecturep

Negative 30408 pI have a fullscreen activity which holds a ViewPager and 2 control buttons. p  pI want to differentiate between swiping and clicking on an image in the ViewPager, so when I click on the image, it will toggle showinghiding the UI and not when swiping. For that, I have set an onClick method to the child ImageView of ViewPager.p  pHowever, this does not seem to work. When the UI is hidden, if I swipe the image, it does not go to the next image, but instead showing the UI. I can only swiping between images when the UI is shown.p  pI have tried to find a method which responsible for the first click event in the activity but theres none. Anyone has a solution for thisp

Negative 30408 pI am working on the project where we are approximating ex using a taylor series, with x being a user entered value. The test values that we have been given are x.5, x1.0, and x1.5. The goal is to get the output is supposed to be a table with a row for each iteration of the loop that creates the series, with the first column containing the number of iterations, the second column the theoretical value based on expx, the third the total of the summation, and the forth difference between the theoretical value and the iterated value.p  pMy code as it is currently is below. As it stands, my logic has some hole in it, as the code builds and runs, but the output is not correct.

If it helps, the Perl script Im running automatically generates a space delimited file containing the results of its calculations once the program exists, but it would be super helpful if only a few of its outputs were written onto a single seperate .csv file for each .txt file processed.p  pNo idea where to go from here but I absolutely have to get this working.

Is there anything I can do to prevent this behaviorp  precodelibraryreadr  df1 lt data.frameDate  as.Datec20121102, 20121104, 20121107, 20121109, 20121111, Text  cWhy, Does, This, Happen, , stringsAsFactors  F classdf1Date  [1] Date dputdf1Date[1]  structure15646, class  Date   Write to dummy csv write.csvdf1, file  dummycsv.csv, row.names  F   Read back in data using both read.csv and readcsv df2 lt read.csvdummycsv.csv, as.is  T, colClasses  cDate, character df3 lt readcsvdummycsv.csv   Examine structure of date values classdf2Date  [1] Date classdf3Date  [1] Date  dputdf2Date[1]  structure15646, class  Date dputdf3Date[1]  structure15646L, class  Date   Try to join using dplyr joins both lt fulljoindf2, df3, by  cDate Error cannot join on columns Date x Date Cant join on Date x Date because of incompatible types Date  Date    Base merge works both2 lt mergedf2, df3, by  Date   converting a POSIXlt object to Date is also stored as numeric tempdate lt as.Dateas.POSIXct11OCT2012190000, format  dbYHMS dputtempdate  structure15624, class  Date codepre  pJudging by a hrefhttpsgithub.comhadleydplyrissues1303 relnofollowthis issuea on the codedplyrcode repo it seems like Hadley thinks this is a feature but any time your date values are stored differently you cant merge on them, and I havent figured out a way to convert the integer date object to a numeric one. Is there anyway to stop the readr package from doing this or any way to convert a Date object stored as an integer to a numeric valuep

Negative 30408 pIm new to Python in that I learned it through a CodeAcademy course and could use some help with figuring this out.p  pI have a file, TestingDeleteLines.txt, thats about 300 lines of text.

My current thinking was that I could write the lines to a list, then reopen the file, match the list to the text file, and if it finds a match, delete the lines. p  pMy current problem is twofoldp  ol liIts duplicating the random elements. If it picks a line, I need it to not pick that same line again. However, using random.sample doesnt seem to work, as I need those lines separated out when I later use each line to append to a URL.li lipI dont feel like my logic write to arrayfind matches in text filedelete is the most ideal logic.
