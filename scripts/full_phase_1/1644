Positive 1644 pIm am trying to use tablesorter to parse json returned for a php POST request.p  pThe Post request returns the json successfully, however, the tablesorter doesnt function correctly.  From what I can tell, only the static table data is taking the tablesorter. The tablesorter is not being applied to the returned JSON data that is being formatted into the table rows.p  pSo basically, what I get is a the filter functionality on the header values that are manually placed in the HTML body.  I believe that this is happening because the returned json is not in the DOM when tablesorter is being applied to the table.  I thought that placing the tablesorter code after the Jquery php post request would fix this, but still not working.p  pIf the problem tablesorter wont work on the returned data, is my only option then to construct the table in the php, and then return the completed table to the page with a php postp  precode.when.post..phploadjson.php,path dir.done     functiondata     var obj  jQuery.parseJSONdata     var html       forvar i  0 i lt obj.length i         html  lttrgtlttdgt  obj[i].vala lttdgtlttdgt  obj[i].valb lttdgtlttdgt  obj[i].valc lttdgtlttdgt  obj[i].vald lttdgtlttdgt  obj[i].vale lttdgtlttrgt   mytable tbody.first.afterhtml                          mytable      .tablesorter     theme blue,     headerTemplate  content icon,     widthFixed true,     widgets [zebra, filter]         lthtmlgtltbodygt     lttable idmytable classtablesortergt     lttheadgtlttrgt     ltthgtvalaltthgt     ltthgtvalbltthgt     ltthgtvalcltthgt     ltthgtvaldltthgt     ltthgtvaleltthgt     lttrgtlttheadgt     lttbodygt     lttbodygt         lttablegt ltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre
Positive 1644 pI cannot understand what exactly the above names represent. MDN refers to them as codeinterfacescode.

Positive 1644 pThis is mainly a performance question, because I sometimes see it in developers examples for executing JavaScript.p  pWhen it comes to more strict languages like C or Java, conditions are important to prevent execution of functions that require strongnot nullstrong data. And generally, checking for nulls helps prevent parts of the program from executing, thus minimizing memory consumption a shallow explanation, I know.p  pBut when it comes to JavaScript, errors generally dont prevent the rest of your script from executing. Now, in the case of jQuery, initializing DOM behavior on an element requires the CSS selector to return at least one result. But if there are no results, no errors are thrown.p  pMy question is this is there any performance or memory consumption difference in the browser when considering these two examplesp  pstrongCase 1strong emYou check the DOM before executing the jQuery library function.emp  precodevar carousel  [datacarousel] if carousel.length gt 0      carousel.slick         adaptiveHeight true,         lazyLoad progressive       codepre  pstrongCase 2strong emYou execute the jQuery library function without first checking for the existence of the desired selection.emp  precode[datacarousel].slick     adaptiveHeight true,     lazyLoad progressive  codepre  pstrongEDITstrong I wanted to outline a couple of assumptions here to see if this makes any noteworthy differences in how this question is answeredp  ol liExistence of the desired DOM element is not known before execution.li liEvery page throughout the site may have one or more carousels 03 approximately.li liEach DOM element has additional codedatacode attributes for which I check and executing carousel behavior changes e.g. codedatacarouselautoplaycode modifies and refreshes the carousel initialized on that DOM element.li ol  pstrongComparisons between JavaScript and other languages are greatly appreciatedstrongp

Positive 1644 pFacebook uses history.pushstate as far as I understand. So, if you wait for the document.onload or document.readystate you will only get the moment the entire DOM is completely rendered.p  pBut parts of the FB Home page are rendered separately through AJAX calls BigPipe and browser history manipulation, some load faster some slower. Also, if you click Home it will not do redirection but history manipulation. How is it possible to catch these events Because setting a callback to listen for  object mutation for MutationObserver, you need to have the nodes already loaded, but I want to catch them as soon as they arrive, before DOM rendering.p  pThe idea is to catch page content before the browser renders it.p

Dependencies of CommonUtilities include log4net.dll the logging framework and Oracle.DataAccess.dll database driver. p  pI have another project called MyProject that I want to include CommonUtilities in. MyProject also depends on Oracle.DataAccess.p  pIf I use ILMerge and merge CommonUtilities into a single assembly CommonUtilities.dll and reference that from MyProject everything compiles but I am sure I should explicitly reference Oracle.DataAccess from MyProject as it is a dependency and not use the assembly merged into CU. Adding a reference to Oracle.DataAccess as well results in ambiguous using statements as there are two Oracle.DataAccess assemblies referenced.p  pUsing ILMerge Internalize in my case results in compile errors as types from the internalized Oracle.DataAccess assembly are being returned from CommonUtilities and as they are marked internal MyProject does not recognize the type returned.p  pThe only way to make this work is simply to not merge this particular assembly Oracle.DataAccess into CommonUtilities and only reference that from MyProject.  This in turn creates a new problem Which Oracle.DataAccess.dll should I reference  the dependency distributed with CommonUtils or notp  pAre there other ways to go about all thisp

Negative 1644 pLong story short in Linux, how do I ensure that an ACK message is received for a certain TCP packetp  pFull storyp  pIm debugging an AsteriskOpenH323 lt Panasonic IPGW16 issue.p  pAn H323 connection involves two sessions H225.0 and H245.

Here is my experience so farp  ul lipValgrind is a greatId even say best tool but it slows down the server too much making it unusable in production. I tried it on a stage server and it really helped me find some memory related issues but even after fixing them I still get crashes on the production server. I ran my stage server under Valgrind for several hours but still couldnt spot any serious errors. pli lipElectricFence is said to be a real memory hog but I couldnt even get it working properly. It segfaults almost immediately on the stage server in random weird places where Valgrind didnt show any issues at all. Maybe ElectricFence doesnt support threading well.. I have no idea.pli lipDUMA  same story as ElectricFence but even worse. While EF produced core dumps with readable backtraces DUMA shows me only and yes server is built with g flag for surepli lipdmalloc  I configured the server to use it instead of standard malloc routines however it hangs after several minutes. Attaching a gdb to the process reveals its hung somewhere in dmalloc pli ul  pIm gradually getting crazy and simply dont know what to do next. I have the following tools to be tried mtrace, mpatrol but maybe someone has a better ideap  pId greatly appreciate any help on this issue.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I managed to find the source of the bug. However I found it on the stage server not production one using helgrindDRDtsan  there was a datarace between several threads which resulted in memory corruption. The key was to use proper valgrind suppressions since these tools showed too many false positives. Still I dont really know how this can be discovered on the production server without any significant slowdowns...p

Negative 1644 pHow do I invoke a child process from C with UseShellExecute set to false and allow file deletionp  pThe child process is a java program creates a 0 byte file, transfers it to a remote server, and deletes it.  This functionality works when I execute the java program from the Windows command line.p  pIf I invoke the java program from C using a System.Diagnostics.Process instance with StartInfo.UseShellExecute set to false, the child process does not delete the file.  In fact, processing stalls and nothing happens.  If the Process objects StartInfo.UseShellExecute property is set to true, the child process can delete the file, and execution of the parent process proceeds.  However, I need the UseShellExecute property to be false so I can redirect output from the child process.p

Negative 1644 pBased on my research, it seems that what I want to do is not possible, but in case something has changed, I wanted to check to see if anyone had come up with a way to do this.p  pI have a web app that generates reports for print based on user selections in the browser window. I have a custom header and footer that, when the report is printed from the browser, should be repeated on every printed page. It is not the browser header and footer I need, but rather the custom ones that I generate. Also, I dont think this is an issue of CSS and media types, but I am not a CSS expert. I have no issues getting the header and footer to print once, but I cant get them to print on each page. I have read that perhaps if I recreated my report pages using tables, and then used table head tags and CSS, that may work at least to get the header on each page. I have not had success with this yet, but I will try it again if it is the only option. A coworker suggested that I count lines in my php and manually put out the header and footer as required. I guess that is an option, but it just seems like there should be a way to do this that isnt so brute forcep  pThe other caveat is that I have to support IE 6, so I suspect some of the CSS things I have tried are just not supported.p  pIf anyone knows any way to do this, that would be great If there isnt, I will have to rethink my approach.p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongUPDATE 14 Dec 2011strongp  pI made considerable progress with this issue, and using some of the info from the answers, I did produce reports that were usable, but never as nice or as professional as I wanted. Footers would tend to be not close enough to the bottom of the page, I had to do a lot of guess work and brittle calculations about how big text was going to be to decide on inserting page breaks, I could only support a restricted set of page formats, and any changes to the reports resulted in a cascade of code changes and yet more brittle calculations. There was always a scenario that broke some part of some report. We revisted the requirements, strongand are now generating reports as PDFs using TCPDFstrong. The documentation is a bit opaque, and it takes some experimentation, but the results are far superior and now the reports appear as they should. I would say to anyone trying to do HTML reports from the browser, unless they are very simple, save yourself the frustration as others told me here and go with PDFs or something similar.p
Negative 1644 pI have a table [User] and another table [Salesperson] in my database. [Salesperson] defines a emuniqueem UserID which maps to [User].UserID with a foreign key. When I generate the model with Entity Framework I get a 1toMany relationship between [User][Salesperson], meaning that each User has a Collection of Salesperson, but what I want is a 0..1to1 relationship where each User has a nullable reference to a Salesperson.p  pI tried fiddling around with the XML and changing the associations multiplicity settings, but that only produced build errors. What I am trying to achieve is no different than having a nullable SalespersonID in [User] that references [Salesperson].SalespersonID, but because salespeople only exist for specific users it feels like Id be muddying up my [User] table structure just to get the relationship to point the right way in Entity Framework.p  pIs there anything I can do to change the multiplicity of the relationshipp

Negative 1644 pstrongQuestionstrong I am wondering which is the optimal solution for dealing with Arrays in Excel 2003 VBA  p  pstrongBackgroundstrong I have a Macro in Excel 2003 that is over 5000 lines.  I have built it over the last 2 years adding new features as new Procedures, which helps to segment the code and debug, change, or add to that feature.  The downside is that I am using much of the same base information in multiple procedures, which requires me to load it into arrays with minor differences multiple times.  I am now running into issues with the length of run time, so I am now able to do a full rewrite.br This file is used to grab multiple items of manufacturing flows up to 4 different set ups with a total of up to 10 distinct flows , of up to 1000 steps each with the information being Flow specific, SubFlow specific for grouping  sorting purposes, and Data such as movements, inventory, CT, ...br It then will stick the data onto multiple sheets used to manage the process utilizing data sheets to be perused, charts, and Cell Formatting to denote process flow capability  history.br The Flow is in the Excel File, while the Manufacturing data is read in with 7 different OO4O Oracle SQL pulls, some reused multiple timesp  pstrongThe Arrays arestrongbr arrrFlow1 to 1000, 1 to 4 as a Record Type with 4 stringsbr arrrSubFlow1 to 1000, 1 to 10 as a Record Type with 4 strings, 2 integers, and 1 singlebr arrrData1 to 1000, 1 to 10 as a Record Type with 1 string, 4 integers, 12 longs, and 1 singlebr arriSort1 to 1000, 1 to 4 as Integer Used as a pointer Array to sort the Flow, Sub Flow, and Data in a Group, Sub Group, and Step order while leaving the original arrays in Step order  p  pstrongPossibilitiesstrongbr 1 Rewrite the macro into one big procedure that loads the data into master arrays dimensioned within the Procedure oncebr Pro Dimensioned in the Procedure rather than as a Public Variable in the Module and not passed.br Con Harder to debug with one mega procedure instead of multiple smaller ones.  p  p2 Keep macro with multiple procedures but passing the Arraysbr Pro Easier to debug code with multiple smaller procedures.br Con Passing Arrays Expensive  p  p3 Keep macro with multiple procedures but with the Arrays being Public Dimed variables in the Modulebr Pro Easier to debug code with multiple smaller procedures.br Con Public Arrays Expensive  p  pSo, whats the communitys verdict  Does anyone know the expense of using Public Arrays vs Passing Arrays  Is the Cost of either of these worth losing the ease of having my procedures being focused on one featurep  pstrongUPDATEstrongbr I load Inventory Data at a discrete level multiple per Step, Moves Data at a aggregate level one per step, and the Beginning of Shift Inventory at an aggregate level.  I aggregate the Inventory data by step placing it in Work State categories Run, Wait,...  I create targets off data already on the sheets.  p  pI have a Flow sheet that shows the Work Flows by Type, currently 3 products have a similar but not exactly the same flow, and 2 products are a different flow, that are similar but again not the same as each other.  I have assigned each set of steps in the different flows a group and subgroup.  p  pI place this data on multiple sheets, some in Step Order, some in group  subgroup order.  I also need the data summed up by group and product, group  subgroup and product, portion of the line and product, and product.  p  pI use Record Types so I actually have a readable three dimensional array, arrSubFlow1,1.strStep Step Name of the 1st Step of the 1st Device, arrData10,5.lngYest Yesterdays movement for the 10th Step of the 5th Device.  p  pMy main point of optimization is going to be in the section where I create 10 pages from scratch every single time.  With Merging Cells, Borders, Headers, ... This is a very time consuming process.  I will add a section that will compare my data with the page to see if it needs to be changed and if so, only then recreate it otherwise, Ill clear each section of data and only write data that changes to the sheet.  This will be huge, based on my time logging data.  However, whenever I update code, I always try to improve other aspects of the code as well.  I see the loading of the data into a Structure Array, RecordSet, Collection strongoncestrong as both a little bit of optimization, but more so for data integrity, so I do not have the opportunity to load it differently for different sheets.p  pThe main issues I see getting away from Arrays right now arebr   Already heavily invested in them, but this is not a good enough reason to not changebr   Dont know if there is much cost to passing them, since it will by ByRefbr   I use a Sort Function to create a Sorted Pointer array that lets me leave the Array in Step Flow order, while easily referencing it by Group  Subgroup order.  p  pSince I am always trying to make my code for now and the future, I am not against updating the arrays to either RecordSets or Collections, but not merely for the sake of changing them to learn something cool.  My arrays work and from my research, they add seconds to the run time, not substantial amounts for this 2 minute report.  So If another structure is easier to update in the future than Twodimensional Arrays of Record Types, then please let me know, but does anyone know the cost of passing an Array to a procedure, assuming you are not doing a ByVal passp

So that if you passed se into the function, it would return the 2 nodes that Im looking for or elements, maybe Im using the terminology incorrect. instead it returns all of the e nodes within that node.p  pIm using J2SE for this, so options are rather limited. I cant use any third party XML Parsers.p  pAnyway, if anyone is still with me and has a suggestion, it would be appreciated.p
Negative 1644 pGreetings,p  pI am working with a FatWire CS, and need to incorporate Web services. FatWire has tags for this, but the previous devs on this system chose to build a homegrown solution rather than use what FatWire offered. The big problem now is that the homegrown solutions dont get updated and typically stop working when we upgrade FatWire. I like building my own stuff too, but I must say I am amazed at how many devs make shortsighted decisions like this... sure, it worked when it needed to, but now its just a messp  pNow, with that said, I have to admit FatWire doesnt offer a lot in the way of examples, and the documentation on Web services is quite thin. So I can see why one might be tempted to do something else. Nevertheless, I am determined to get this working the way FatWire intended.p  pSo, what I am looking for is someone who has done Web services in FatWire before, andor some sample code. Ive generated my client, and I have all the JARs I need... Im just a bit stumped on wiring it up in a way FatWire likes.p  pJudging from the very small number of FatWire posts here, I am cautiously optimistic that someone might be able to help. There is a Yahoo group for FatWire, but I just have an innate aversion to Yahoo groups, I guess.p  pTIAp

Negative 1644 pJust wondered what that best approach is for this scenario  trying to databind to a collection which is being populated in another background thread.p  pMy background thread is adding items to the collection in a processing loop which may run for several minutes.  Every now and then it raises an event to the UI and passes a reference to the data from the collection, for the UI to visualize, so the user can start to interact with what they have and carries on processing.  p  pTrouble is the UI starts to render the visualisation which is quite complex itself, which involves a foreach loop over the collection of data, and understandably that loop craps itself if my background thread changes the data  in the collection during the enumeration.  p  pSo my brainstorming has gone like this p  ol lipause the background thread but I really dont want to pause li litake a duplicate snapshot copy of all, or some the data in each event, and databind to the snapshot.  Doubles my memory usage but would probably workli liimplement some kind of lock on the syncroot or whatever of the collection so while the UI is updating the background process has to wait.  Not confident about that working anywayli lifire the event all the time and just pass one bit of data at a time, which has the same result as 2 but with more overhead..li ol  pcheers   ewart.p

Negative 1644 pI have a performance issue with WCF services hosted in IIS using net.tcp bindings.p  pWe recently ported our system from COM to WCF and tests indicate a performance degradation. Ive been looking at performance counters on the server and the CPU utilisation is very low lt 10, there is plenty of available memory, disk reads are normal etc... I also checked WCF performance counters and the number of outstanding calls is low at most 1 at any given time, number of calls per second is quite low 16 calls per second for a service that is being used the most by the system. All of our services are configured to be per call and single threaded...p  pI have already played around with throttling and set all values for all of the settings to 100 the server is an 8 core machine and my understanding is that the actual throttling values end up being what you set multiplied by the number of CPU. I dont think there is an issue there.p  pI have also made sure that the client is using its connections efficiently not creating new ones where there is an existing tcp connection that can be usedp  pThe current web application hosts about 50 services yep, that is 50 and at the moment I am trying to eliminate this as the source of the problem. I am looking into hosting the services in multiple web applications and Id also like to have them use different ports but I am having some problems with that and I cant find a step by step instructions on the internet anywhere so I am hoping somebody here will be able to help me p  pHere is what Ive tried to do so farbr 1 I added another binding to Default Web Site in IIS that is Ive got two net.tcp bindings, one is set to use 80842 binding information and the other one uses 80942 2 Ive made sure these ports are allowed to go through the firewallbr 3 Then Ive tried to configure each individual web application to filter ports this is a snippet from web.config where I want to use port 808  p  blockquote   pltserviceHostingEnvironmentgtbr          ltbaseAddressPrefixFiltersgtbr              ltadd prefixnet.tcpltservername808gtbr          ltbaseAddressPrefixFiltersgtbr      ltserviceHostingEnvironmentgt  p blockquote  pWhen I try to connect to this service I get a emThe service at the endpoint address net.tcpltservernamegtSomeService.svc is unavailable for the protocol of the addressemp  pIf I remove the ltserviceHostingEnvironmentgt bit.

I have stepped through the code in debug and see the new values are in the object being passed to the Edit function in the controller, but when the commit is called, nothing is updated.See my code

Negative 1644 pWhile I realize that each language has its own convention for indentation, I cant help but be annoyed with something Ive recently discovered.  Consider this code from the PHP manualp  precodeswitch i      case apple         echo i is apple         break     case bar         echo i is bar         break     case cake         echo i is cake         break  codepre  pNotice that each case is indented from the switch statement.  This makes sense, as the code is easier to read and the body of the block is contained one level inside of it.p  pHowever, when I test the equivalent JavaScript switch statement in JSLintp  precodeswitch i      case apple         alerti is apple         break     case bar         alerti is bar         break     case cake         alerti is cake         break  codepre  p...it displays an error telling me that it should appear like this insteadp  precodeswitch i  case apple     alerti is apple     break case bar     alerti is bar     break case cake     alerti is cake     break  codepre  pIt seems counterintuitive, as each case is now inline with the switch block itself.  I cant imagine any reason why this would be considered better, much less trigger an error.p  pIs JSLint in err, or is it just following convention  If the latter is true, why wouldnt the convention be to indent for clarityp

Ive got a good huge list of indexes that should cover pretty much all of my queries, but when I added them to my database via migrations it only took a few seconds to add them.

Things work smoothly unless the user has to scroll through a long list. p  pProgressBars start taking on the progress of other ProgressBars not currently visible on the screen.p  pI understand that this is a common issue that stems from the implementation of GetView, but Im wondering what the best course of action is to take with ProgressBars. p  pGetViewp  precodepublic View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent          View row  convertView         ViewWrapper wrapper         ProgressBar myProgressBar         int initProgress  myData.getposition.getProgress          if row  null             LayoutInflater inflater  context.getLayoutInflater             row  inflater.inflateR.layout.row, null               wrapper  new ViewWrapperrow             row.setTagwrapper                       else             wrapper  ViewWrapperrow.getTag                    RowModel model  getModelposition                 wrapper.getPid.setTextmodel.toString         myProgressBar  wrapper.getProgressBar         myProgressBar.setProgressinitProgress         myProgressBar.setMax100          myProgressBar.setTagnew Integerposition          return row         codepre  pViewWrapperp  precodepublic class ViewWrapper      View base     TextView pid  null     ProgressBar pb null      ViewWrapperView base         this.base  base           TextView getPid         ifpid  null             pid  TextViewbase.findViewByIdR.id.pid                   returnpid           ProgressBar getProgressBar         ifpb null             pb ProgressBarbase.findViewByIdR.id.progressbar                   returnpb       codepre  pIt seems that the issue is related top  precodemyProgressBar  wrapper.getProgressBar codepre  pbecause that ProgressBar starts getting the behavior of a recycled ProgressBar.

Negative 1644 pI have a large number of EXE files and need to figure out which ones have digital signatures. Does anyone know if there is a way to check without access to WinVerifyTrust theyre all on a Unix server. p  pI cant seem to find any information on where the digital signature actually is inside the EXE. If I could find out where it is I might be able to open the file and fseek to a location to test. I dont need to do real verification on the certificate, I just want to see if a digital signature is present or, more importantly, NOT present without having to use WinVerifyTrust. p

Negative 1644 pI have been working on this subject for a long time now and to be honest I am in need of some help if you guys have some time to answer to my problem p  pI have a few k of emails in my database around 2k and coming up... and I would like to send two newsletters a week ... what would be the best way to achieve that p  pSo far here is what I am doing   a script php with meta tag refresh set to 600 which sends every 10 minutes an email to 50 people using basic mail function. It runs for 6 hours to get to the 2k emails. I am using the less expensive shared server at 1and1 2EUR a month D.p  p1 Is this way to proceed a good way  I heard when you put people in BCC you go to SPAM directly ... Also many people do not even receive the emails ... no idea why. So far it is not really conclusive.p  p2 Do you think it would worth taking the dedicated server and send 1 email to each people thats to say 2k different emails  Or is it a bad move p  p3 How do people proceed when sending newsletters  Im sure I look ridiculous with 2k emails and though I have difficulties in making my way through this p  pAny help welcome.p  pCheers.

Negative 1644 pHere is the questionp  pImplement a singleton design pattern as a template such that, for any given class Foo, you can call Singletoninstance and get a pointer to an instance of a singleton of type Foo. Assume the existence of a class Lock which has acquire and release methods. How could you make your implementation thread safe and exception safep  pMy analysisp  pas Joshua Bloch points out in effective java, the better ways to implement      a singleton class is enum and public static factory method. Combining volatile     and synchronized is the way I know to make it thread safe and lazy initialization      as follows p  precodepublic class myS   private static volatile final ins  null   private myS   public static myS getIns     synchronized       ifinsnull ins  new myS          return ins       codepre  pAt this moment, I am a little confused to make a singleton template. My understanding is that we either have an interface with generic type or an abstract class. As long as the clients implement them, they are singleton. So, my guess solution is as followsp  precodepublic interface singletonltTgt     public T instance   public class Foo implements singletonltTgt     private static volatile final Foo ins  null           public static Foo instance         synchronizedthis                       ifinsnull                 ins  new Foo                              codepre

Negative 1644 pI ran into a problem when making a carousel with jQuery. It works just fine with Chrome, FF, IE7 and IE9. IE8 is the only one with problems.p  pThe carousel has items floating side by side, and when an item is clicked, its width is extended to show the content. And if clicked again, it retracts back to its original width.p  pThe problem is that when I click one of the items item1 it doesnt work. And when I take a look at it with IEs dev tools, I can clearly see that it is in fact open. It just doesnt render the change. Then if I click the element right of the item1 item2, item1 jumps to the extented width without animating. If I click item1 again, it retracts back to original width and this is where the problem occurs.

Negative 1644 pI am presenting a view controller as a modal. This view controller has several UITextFields connected via IB.p  pMy issue is when hitting the return key, the delegate method is called, but for some reason the call to resignFirstResponder on the given textField is not. Even if I print a message to the console in the textFieldShouldReturn delegate method it gets printed, but it will simply refuse to call the resign method.p  pIn the shouldReturn delegate method I only havep  precodeBOOLtextFieldShouldReturnUITextField textField      [textField resignFirstResponder]     return  YES  codepre  pThis has really never happened to me before, it just simply will not resignFirstResponder. As I mentioned before, I can place a print to console, just to verify that the shouldReturn method gets called and it does.p  pI also tried this just to see if the delegate was been set or not and it sure made the change to the UITextField behavior.p  precodevoidtextFieldDidBeginEditingUITextField textField      [textField setTextAlignmentUITextAlignmentCenter]  codepre  pThis issue truly baffles me. Even when I attempt to call resignFirstResponder on the textfield directly it wont dismiss the keyboard.p  precodeBOOLtextFieldShouldReturnUITextField textField      if [textField isEqualself.productTextField]          NSLogProduct textfield         [self.productTextField resignFirstResponder]      else if [textField isEqualself.quantityTextField]          NSLogQuantity textfield          return YES  codepre  pBoth logs work with their respective textfields and print their corresponding messages each. But calling the method still does nothing when messaging the textfield directly.p  pFound the answer, apparently, UIPresentationFormSheet does not allow you to get rid of the keyboard.

Negative 1644 pAnother cry for help about this warning.p  pFirst of all I have looked at every and all questions on here elsewhere and none seem to fit my situation.  It has nothing to do with Alert boxes and resigning as first responder, nor performing any animation before views get displayed.  My problem occurs when instantiating a UIView based custom keyboard.p  pSecondly, I believe that I can make the warning appeardisappear at will.  I am just very confused as to why, so I am looking more for an explanation than a solution. p  pThere is too much code to post here, so Ill just give an outline of what is going onp  blockquote   pThe ViewController Calc instantiates a custom UIView based DataView in the VCs loadView method, and then adds it as a sub view of the VC.p      pThe DataView instantiates a custom UITextField based TextFieldKPD in the DataViews init methodp      pThe TextField instantiates a custom UIView based KeyPad in the TextFields init method, and assigns that KeyPad to the TextFields inputView.p      pThe KeyPad creates 13 UIButtons of type UIButtonTypeCustom, reads in and assigns a pressed and not pressed image for each button, as well as setting actions for the buttons.  It then adds each button as a subview of itself.  By controlling when in the UIView lifecycle  of the KeyPad that this construction occurs, is how I can effect the waitfences warning see below.p blockquote  pThe Calc ViewController is the one that is initially presented to the user. I have tracked down the waitfences warning as occurring after the end of the Calcs viewDidLayoutSubViews method and before its viewDidAppear method is called.  Note that the KeyPad is not visible when the Calc is displayed.p  pI appear to be able to control the action of the waitfences warning by changing how the Keypad is constructedp  ul lipIf the UIButtons are instantiated and added as subviews in the init method of the KeyPad, then I will get the warning, once and once only.pli lipIf, instead, the buttons are instantiated and added in the KeyPads layoutSubViews method, then the warning does not appear.  But the KeyPad doesnt effectively get constructed until I tap on the TextField  still, no waitfences warning then eitherpli ul  pThere is no animation or anything in Calcs loadView.  It is instantiate and assign all the way down.p  pSo any comments on this version of waitfences  p  pstrongEDIT 1, Jan 30th  Now With Even More Confusionstrongp  pI was bored this morning so I decided to play with my code to see if I could better isolate the generation of the warning. I narrowed it down to the following, totally useless code that with which I can now trigger the warningp  precodevoidloadImages      UIImage image      forint i0 ilt16 i          image  [UIImage imageNamedStupidFileNameThatDoesNotExist]       codepre  pIf I perform code[self loadImages]code in the init method of codeKeyPadcode then the warning appears.  But this code does nothing as the file does not exist.  I believe that if the loop counter is small enough that the warning does go away, but I havent qualified a lower limit. p  pIf I replace the actual loading of the image with p  pcode[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFileStupidFileNameThatDoesNotExist]code p  pand still call the method during the codeKeyPadcode init, then I do not seem to get the warning.  One obvious difference between these two ways of loading the image is that codeimageNamedcode caches the image internally.p  pSo I am leaning towards Georges answer that it is an internal Apple screw up. p  pstrongEdit 2, Feb 1  Its a warning Jim, but not as we know itstrongp  pSo I convinced myself that it was the caching in the UIImage class that was obviously causing the issue.  What to do about it  Well write my own image cache of coursep  pSo I started plugging away, rip out that code that attempted to load invalid images and got the point where I generated the file names I needed and passed them to my cache controller.  So to verify that things were starting to come together, within the cache controller, I generated a NSLog message for each attempt to cache an image  nothing more  just log the file name.p  pAnd guess what  I get the stupid warning again.  For doing no actual work at all.p  pI can only conclude that there is some sort of internal iOS race condition that I am triggering when I cram extra code into the init method of codeKeyPadcode.  And that there is nothing I can do to mitigate it.  All I can do is hope that this warning is benign.p  pstrongEdit 3, Hamlet Act 1 scene 4 Something is rotten in the state of Denmarkstrongp  pKeeping the same code as in Edit 2, I commented out the NSLog statement.  And the warning went away.  I put it back, and the warning appears.p  pSo the code I have isp  precodevoidloadImages       Iterate over button definitions and cache the required images     forint i0 iltnumKeys i           if [imageCache imageExistsForTagkeyTags[i]]              [imageCache addImageFile[NSString stringWithFormatsNP.png,keyNames[i]] forTagkeyTags[i]]                   if [imageCache imageExistsForTagkeyTags[i]pressedOffset]              [imageCache addImageFile[NSString stringWithFormatsP.png,keyNames[i]] forTagkeyTags[i]pressedOffset]                  codepre  pAndp  precodevoidaddImageFileNSStringimageFile forTaginttag      NSLogAdding tagd for file , tag, imageFile  codepre  pWith that NSLog statement controlling the appearance of the warning.p  pstrongEdit 4, Feb 2  Welcome to the Temple of Doomstrongp  pTaking Allens comments to heart I rebuilt my keyboard as a XIB and loaded that instead of manually trying to build the view.  Of course that didnt fix anything.  I had hoped that the Nib loading would happen outside of what ever it is that is causing the problem.p  pMy gut feeling is that I am butting up against a race condition within the loadView of Calc and some internal iOS activity.  If I do too much work inside loadView then I cross the line  and trip a waitfences warning.  And that the keyboard is a symptom and not the underlying cause.  IE it could have been any activity, it was just that the keyboard work was the last thing I did before the warning started appearing.  I just wish that I actually knew what the constraints were that I was actually crossing and not stumbling around in the dark.p

So I determine that the  value of codencode is decremented.

In that case, codecustomer.Namecode will be equal to codeoriginalCustomer.Namecode and we will not be able to detect if it differs from the database.p  pI guess the same problem exists with most other ORMs as well, because of the identitymap design pattern.p  pAny ideas how this can be solved Can I somehow force EF to always give me a new instance of the customer class p  pOr should we refactor the code instead Does anyone know of any good design patterns for this scenariop

Negative 1644 pIn our DB, every codePersoncode has an ID, which is the DB generated, autoincremented integer.

For the purpose of this question, I will call what we need to generate, the codeUIDcode. p  pstrongNotestrong The UID is not meant to replace the DB ID. You can think of the UID as a prettier version of the DB ID, which we can give out to the users.p  ul liI was wondering if this UID can be a function of the DB ID. That is, we should be able to regenerate the same UID for a given DB ID.li liObviously, the function will take a salt or key, in addition to the DB ID.li liThe UID should not be sequential. That is, two neighboring DB IDs should generate visually differentlooking UIDs. li liIt is not strictly required for the UID to be irreversible. That is, it is okay if somebody studies the UID for a few days and is able to reverseengineer and find the DB ID. I dont think it will do us any harm.li liThe UID should contain only AZ uppercase only and 09. Nothing else. And it should not contain characters which can be confused with other alphabets or digits, like 0 and O, l and 1 and so on. I guess Crockfords Base32 encoding takes care of this.li liThe UID should be of a fixed length 10 characters, regardless of the size of the DB ID. We could pad the UID with some constant string, to bring it to the required fixed length. The DB ID could grow to any size. So, the algorithm should not have any such input limitations.li ul  pI think the way to go about this isp  pstrongStep 1 Hashing.strongp  pI have read about the following hash functionsp  ul liSHA1li liMD5li lia hrefhttpburtleburtle.netbobhashdoobs.html relnofollowJenkinsali ul  pThe hash returns a long string.

This step can be repeated till a unique UID is found for a particular DB ID.li ul  pI would love to get some expert advice on whether I am going along the correct lines and how I go about actually implementing this.p  pI am going to be implementing this in a strongRuby On Railsstrong app. So, please take that into consideration in your suggestions.p  pThanks.p  h2Updateh2  pThe comments and answer made me rethink and question one of the requirements I had the need for us to be able to regenerate the UID for a user after assigning it once. I guess I was just trying to be safe, in the case where we lose a users UID and we will able to get it back if it is a function of an existing property of the user. But we can get around that problem just by using backups, I guess.p  pSo, if I remove that requirement, the UID then essentially becomes a totally random 10 character alphanumeric string. I am adding an answer containing my proposed plan of implementation. If somebody else comes with a better plan, Ill mark that as the answer.p
Negative 1644 pIm building an application that has a widget and a button in the widget launches an IntentService. The onHandleIntent runs some code and then raises a toast through a handler.

Negative 1644 pI have a stored procedure, shown below, which I created to add dollar sales to a table WeeklySales which currently stores only unit sales. The cursor operates on on the WeeklySales table. The pricing data is stored in the Pricing table. The Pricing table actually contains changes in prices. The effective date for a price change is stored in Pricing.effectiveDate, so I have to find the pricing which was effective for the week in which the unit was sold which is stored in WeeklySales.weekStart.p  pThe problem Im having is that the first select after the IF doesnt return anything. Ive confirmed that this select does return a value when I run it outside of the procedure using the values which it would be called with inside the procedure.

Negative 1644 pIm in the process of replacing a .NETs codeWebBrowsercode for a codeWebKit.NETcode, and one of the functionalities Ive been using in the codeWebBrowsercode that I cant figure out how to implement in the wrapper Im writing around codeWebKitcode is the ability to pass DOM elements from and to JavaScript and C code.p  pIn a codeWebBrowsercode youd just call a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.htmldocument.invokescript.aspx relnofollowcodeInvokeScriptcodea and pass an the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.htmlelement.domelement.aspx relnofollowcodeDomElementcodea property of an codeHtmlElementcode as a parameter, and the JavaScript function would get the element. Same way, you can pass an element from JavaScript to C and the C code would get a codeDomElementcode object. p  pIn codeWebKitcode as far as I know I cannot do this. The codeInvokeStriptMethodcode method is broken, but the codeStringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromStringcode is not, which let me inject scripts into the current document and invoke them any time later.p  pNote that these documents wont be my own created documents so I cant do stuff like assigning IDs to every element. This is a web scraper and I need to avoid messing with the documents elements as much as possible.p  pOne hack that would probably work is assigning a temporary ID to the element and keeping the old ID backed up, then I can do a codeGetElementByIdcode call from either JavaScript or C to get the element, and then reassign the old elements ID. The problem is that WebKits codeGetAttributeidcode will give me an empty string when the ID is codeundefinedcode, so there is no way for my C code to know whether the ID was an empty string or codeundefinedcode, and who knows, the current web pages script could rely on the ID being codeundefinedcode for some reason, so setting the ID to an empty string could mess up their javascript.p  pAnyone has a better idea or is there any other codeWebKitcode method I could usep

Negative 1644 pIm curious how to optimize this code p  precodefun n  sum l, f  f0 l, g  g0 l   where l  map h [1..n] codepre  pAssuming that codefcode, codef0code, codegcode, codeg0code, and codehcode are all costly, but the creation and storage of codelcode is extremely expensive. p  pAs written, codelcode is stored until the returned tuple is fully evaluated or garbage collected.  Instead, codelength lcode, codef0 lcode, and codeg0 lcode should all be executed whenever any one of them is executed, but codefcode and codegcode should be delayed. p  pIt appears this behavior could be fixed by writing p  precodefun n  a seq b seq c seq a, f b, g c   where     l  map h [1..n]     a  sum l     b  inline f0  l     c  inline g0  l codepre  pOr the very similar p  precodefun n  a,b,c deepSeq a, f b, g c   where ... codepre  pWe could perhaps specify a bunch of internal types to achieve the same effects as well, which looks painful.  Are there any other optionsp  pAlso, Im obviously hoping with my codeinlinecodes that the compiler fuses codesumcode, codef0code, and codeg0code into a single loop that constructs and consumes codelcode term by term.  I could make this explicit through manual inlining, but thatd suck.  Are there ways to explicitly prevent the list codelcode from ever being created andor compel inlining  Pragmas that produce warnings or errors if inlining or fusion fail during compilation perhapsp  pAs an aside, Im curious about why codeseqcode, codeinlinecode, codelazycode, etc. are all defined to by codelet x  x in xcode in the Prelude.  Is this simply to give them a definition for the compiler to overridep

Negative 1644 pI really like the idea of properties in C, and as a little side project, Ive been tinkering with the idea of implementing them in C. I ran into this example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5924594245869httpstackoverflow.coma5924594245869a which seems fairly nice, but I couldnt help but think that lambdas and nonstatic data member initialization may make it possible to use some very nice syntax with this idea.

Negative 1644 pWhy is this sooooo difficult All I want is a list of the field names in the Phonegap Contacts API. Not a big deal you would think, but it is  in fact, this is almost a generic problem with the Phonegap documentation theres no details of the parameters that a method takes. The examples are not exhaustive which leaves users to go ahunting elsewhere.p  pSo I went to a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTR2010WDcontactsapi20100121widlContactPropertiesname relnofollowhttpwww.w3.orgTR2010WDcontactsapi20100121widlContactPropertiesnamea and saw that the standard fields were name, nicknames, phones, emails and addresses. Hmmmm Lets see if this workd then codep  pvar fieldArray  new Arrayname,displayName,phoneNumbers,addresses,emailsp  pfor i0i  pforj  0 j lt fieldArray.length jp  precodealertField Name fieldArray[j]n Data contacts[i].name[0]n Data contacts[i].displayName  alertn Name  contacts[i].name[0]     codepre  pp  p codep  pNot a chance. In particular, the second alert  contacts[i].name[0]  was the one I was most interested in. It simply returns undefined. Tried this contacts[i].name[0].value. Nada.p  pSo question what are the field names in a contact list and can someone with a contact in Phonegap ask them PLEASE to do something about the abysmal state of their documentation. I would volunteer, but I dont have the knowledge of Phonegap necessary to do the job justice.p

Stepping through the code I see the BOOL change to YES, but when I am sent back to VCA it is back to NOp  pUpdate this is all on the Main Thread.p  pHere is my code.p  pViewControllerA.hp  precodeBOOL shouldLogin  propertynonatomic,assignBOOL shouldLogin codepre  pViewControllerA.mp  precodesynthesize shouldLogin   in viewWillAppear of ViewControllerA if shouldLogin  YES  do something  im trying to get in here but I cant because the BOOL is NO when I come back to this view   codepre  pHere is how I set the BOOL in ViewControllerBp  precode    ViewControllerA  vc  [[ViewControllerA alloc]init]     vc.shouldLogin  YES     stepping through the code and looking at the value, shouldLogin shows YES      [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedYES]  this drops down VCB which will show VCA  now VCA just came into view and the BOOL is now NO which makes the compiler skip over my IF statement codepre  pstrongUPDATED removed the release call that I had, but still same issue.strongp

Negative 1644 pHi there i need some information or general tips on a problem with maven.p  pContext We just migrated one big eclipse project into 4 maven project. Thats one step in the good direction We were building thatthose project with an ant script build.xml We were selecting the task to do ondemandp  pTo keep it simple here are the 4 project  Core, Client, Server, Admin. Each of those maven project build into a jar. This have been establish and it is working perfectly. Core is a dependency to Client and Server.p  pWe use JenkinsCI and Artifactory on a remote server.p  pProblem I need to create some kind of parent project that will build all those other maven project and add some task on demand that we were doing with an ant script.  Exemple We want to build locally So we dont use jenkins and artifactory on this side for our developper so they can test manually their update yes we have no test for now, we are working on a legacy system. On this build, we do not want to obfuscate the code or sign our jar..etc We also want a customer build The real release that we push on the server, so it does use jenkins and artifactory That will add some task on some of the 4 project like obfuscating the code, signing the jar ..etc For this customer build, we need to be able to select our dependency of a library onthefly or more like On demand. Our program is an extension to another software and all our customer dont use the same version. To make it simple the library y can be y2.0.1.jar or y2.0.2.jar.. etc  All of those task i need can be done in different mavenplugin with no problem. p  pQuestion What would be a good practice to solve my problem. We would really like to get rid of our ant script. Also we are cleaning a big big dirty project so i would like a clean solution without a lots of duplicated stuff or lots of manually task to do each time we want to build either locally or on the remote server for our customer.p  pIdea I though i could use different maven profile in all those 4 project as i saw there a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2132958anttomavenmultiplebuildtargetsant to maven  multiple build targetsa But i will have a seriously huge pom.xml for each project with lots of duplicated stuff so I really dont like this idea. I though we could have a parent maven project but this would contain no code so i think Im wrong with this idea also.p  pThank for answering and for your timep

Negative 1644 pI have an OSX application written in ObjectiveCCocoa using xcode. The application is quite finished, tested and sold on the App Store. p  pI havent worked on this application for some time and recently, I rebuilt it using xcode 4.3.3 on my OSX 10.7.4 and I noticed that while it builds just fine, there are some very strange visual glitches when running the application that were never seen before and occasionally, I get EXCBADACCESS when closing the application. All these seem to be related to the PDFKit framework I am using. I am unable to debug these problems since the glitches are just visual nothing I can check in code and EXCBADACCESS exception comes from internally allocated objects not related to my code.p  pThe code itself havent changed, I tried previous revisions of the code and they all exhibit the same strange behavior now. I tried running an old binary I have of the application compiled couple of months ago and it works just fine. Then I tried building it with previous versions of xcode, down to 4.2.1 which I know was ok when I submitted the app to the app store and the problems still occur.p  pThen I suspected this may be something specific to my environment so I built the project on different machine also with xcode 4.3.2 and OSX 10.7.4. Same results, the problems are still there.p  pSo now I suspect that it has something to do with the OSX 10.7.4 update since this is the last thing that was changed between now and when I was able to produce a good build of the application. I am pretty puzzled to what to do next and how to identify the cause of this problem. I have an old binary that is working fine and I have a newly compiled binary of the same code revision that has problems. p  pIs there any useful information I can get from the difference of these binaries What can I do to determine the cause of these problems What can I try nextp  pThanksp  pNOTE update I stated it above but I want to make sure it is clear. This is a Mac OSX Cocoa application, not iOS.p

Negative 1644 pWe have a central Sonar server for scanning and reporting on all the code within the organization.  We also have the Sonar plugin for Eclipse RTC so that we can run local analysis as we edit code.p  pThe problem Ive got is that I need to set exclusions on 3rd party libraries so they dont get parsed when running a local analysis.  Ive seen how to set exclusions on the server but I dont have permissions to alter the server setup and dont see the need to do this for a local analysis.  I also dont have a local Sonar server running on my dev computer so I cant point the plugin to a server other than our central instance.p  pSo the question is how do I set exclusions specifically for my local analysis without a local sonar server e.g. codelocalhost9000code  Do I need to create a properties file, set an XML file, etc  If so then where do I put it so that the plugin picks up the exclusions  I tried setting a properties file in the root of the project folder with the syntaxp  precodeexclusions[projectRootFolder]srcmainjavacom.java codepre  pBut the code in that folder structure still gets parsed.p

Negative 1644 pBy my understanding, when PHP encounters codeincludecode or coderequirecode, or their codeoncecode versions, it looks up the file in the filesystem and parses it identically to how it would if the code were in the place of the codeincludecode call with the exception of codereturncode called in the file.p  pSo, on a busy server, it is easily conceivable that many people will be hitting included files for instance, the file that connects to a database, or defines global functions repeatedly. Could this have a noticeable impact on performancep  pWould it be advantageous to compile includes by dumping the contents of the file into the relevant placesp

Negative 1644 pI have a requirement in which the user can select an image from codecamera rollcode and my application needs to optimize the image and upload it to a server. I am using codeALAssetscode library and a custom picker for the user to select a photo from codecamera rollcode. I am able to achieve this perfectly but have a problem with the file size getting increased.  p  pThe problem is as followsbr When the user selects a photo, of 1.7MB That is the full size as reported by the codeiOScode when I try to mail the photo, when I directly get the bytes from the codeALAssetRepresentationcode of that codeALAssetcode and convert it to codeNSDatacode the size of data is 1.7MB too. But, when I get a UIImage from the codeALAssetRepresentationcode using the following code..  p  pUIImage selImage  [UIImage imageWithCGImage[assetRepresentation fullResolutionImage] scale[assetRepresentation scale] orientation[assetRepresentation orientation]]p  pand converting the codeUIImagecode to codeNSDatacode using codeUIImageJPEGRepresentationcode with compression quality  1.0f, the NSData size becomes almost double the original size 3.2MB.p  pShouldnt it ideally be 1.7MB onlyp  pAs expected, when I save it to a file, the file size still says 3.2MB I checked it using xcode 4.2 by importing the sandbox apps documents folder.

Negative 1644 pIs it a bad practice to have backbone views which do not depend on any kind of templating systemp  pOf course, this does not mean that any kind of DOM code will be generated by hand, using hardcoded strings within the views. No no no. I can of course cache the basic layout for each view in DOM elements, set to displaynone. However, I want to reduce any kind of value setting  within the templates themselves. Id rather do that using jquery, or any other kind of DOM modifier form within the view itself. This way I save myself the constant discrepancies and the countless hours of efforts that Ive exposed my apps and myself to, using Mustache, Handelbars, the Underscore templating system, etc. Having all the view logic in one place makes everything much cleaner, at least in my view. It gives a lot of benefits, such as proper partial rendering, value binding, etc, that Id need tons of days to spend on if I wanted to implement them with mustache or something.p  pThe only problem that I see might occur is whether the constant checks that Id do with jQuery  will be performing fast enough, but I guess that it shouldnt be such a problem at the end.p  pWhat do you think Good Bad Practicalp

Negative 1644 pConsider a worker process which searches the web for particular data. Another process is needed to index the results of the first process for later use. The indexing part involves writing raw data search results to a huge distributed HBase repository in a particular way. I cant judge about the speed of these two processes compared to each other. We may have a situation in which one of these systems is temporarily down and needs to take the task where it is put upon its wakeup. Im using JavaEE. Currently, this is the way I have in mind to implement this.p  ol liThe first process stores the result of its search in a MySQL database and sends a message containing the IDs of the new rows it has put in the table.li liThe MOM wakes up the second process to consume the new raw data stored in the MySQL database.li liThe second process clears up the MySQL table when it finishes indexing the data in the real database HBase.li ol  pI need expert comments on my design to verify its appropriateness. For instance, what if the second process continuously polls the table to see if there is new records Am I using the correct technology or it is an overkill Should I simplify my design or am I missing something If my solution is appropriate, is there something I should keep in mind during the implementation Thanks in advance.p

Now I have read I can just replace codeltdiv classrowgtcode with codeltdiv classcontainergtcode for instance and it will generate that effect. Now for some reason this does not feel right, should I just create my own class thats full width, or what would be the proper way to do thisp  p2 I would love to have it based for a larger resolution, maybe a max 1440px wide or even a fluid 100 full width. How could I go about doing this, andor is Foundation not the correct framework for me I love the fact it comes with all the templates so is super quick and friendly to do mockups.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1644 pI found out that codePropertyEditorManagercode registersfinds editors per codeThreadGroupContextcode basis, not per global registry as prior to Java7. p  pAnd Java7 every time creates a new ThreadGroupContext for a new codeThreadGroupcode. Thus PropertyEditorFinder which actually registersfinds editors is again new.p  pJava uses predefined editors for some classes codeBytecode, codeLongcode, etc and registers them in codePropertyEditorFindercode at codectorcode. Lets say I want to register my own codePropertyEditorcode for some predefined class i.e. Long. Its easy to do in Java6, but in Java7, each time threads are created within new codeThreadGroupcode I lost my editor.p  pSo could you please tell me  is there any solution to handle in a nice manner which editors are created for a new codeThreadGroupcode in Java7 If face some issue and how do you overcome itp  pP.S. I guess I should apologize for my English p  pP.P.S. codeThreadGroupContextcode is a replacement for codeAppContextcode. And I was hoping that implementation of creating contexts would be similar both use mapping between codeThreadGroupcode to context codeAppContextcode in java 6, codeThreadGroupContextcode in java 7. And java 6 uses the same codeAppContextcode for new codeThreadGroupcode as for its parent. In other words codeAppContextcode is used for the whole codeThreadGroupcode tree in a jvm. But unfortunately creating of codeThreadGroupContextcode is different  it is simply a new context for a new group. So the question is automatically resolved if one day codeThreadGroupContextcode will use the same creating technique.p

Negative 1644 pIm pretty new to Android to be precise 1 day, so please bear with the explanation,p  pThe requirement is to port the existing code C amp C which is working on iOS to Android. Almost everything went well, except libxml2. The code is dependent on this. And as one of the suggestions got from this very forum, I got the source code of libxml2 and compiled it for Android. But when trying to create a Shared library of it, its not able to resolve the external dependencies. Its throwing an error undefined reference to ucnvclose, ucnvopen,..., for almost every function dependent on ucnv.p  pI think ucnv comes as icu4c external library. I tried to compile this too, but in vain. This is throwing errors dynamiccast not permitted with fnortti and cannot use typeid with fnortti. Im totally clue less here dont exactly know on enabling  disabling the flag fnortti and also its significance, and also dont prefer to hack around a well written code.p  pSo, can anyone please explain on how to link shared amp static  integrate the external libraries specially libxml2 also icu4c if required with CC code,. I saw explanations on .jar, but couldnt get how itll fit here Any information to resolve  understand the problem Im facing will be really helpful,..p  pThanks for reading,..p

Negative 1644 pI am creating a video player which relies on loading both the vimeo and youtube playlist apis through ajax. Once they are loaded, for youtube I then need to loop through all the videos in the playlist and call the data api for each video to get its modified date.

Negative 1644 pI have a static encryptiondecryption class with static methods in one of my libraries. The code is a bit large so I posted it here a hrefhttppastebin.comzRZtNmjU relnofollowhttppastebin.comzRZtNmjUap  pI havent had any issues with this code until it started being used within the execution stack of some code executing in a codeParallel.ForEachcode call. I tried adding some use of codelockcode on some of the MemoryStream and CryptoStream variables but that hasnt seemed to help. I did this because I am fairly certain this issue is being caused by accessing this static class amp methods from multiple threads.p  pThe exception I keep getting is Padding is invalid and cannot be removed.p  pThis exception occurs when execution reaches codedecryptedTextStream.FlushFinalBlockcode within the last method in the code called Decrypt line 250.p  pMy question is  I cant figure out whats wrong with the code and am wondering if the only issue is that the class and methods are static Ive been using this code without a single issue for months and have only recently run into issues when starting to use it within some other TPL code. Should I just refactor this class into being instancebased or will that not solve the exception Im gettingp
Negative 1644 pLooking to write some tests for my application, I stumbled upon the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtoolstestingindex.html relnofollow titleAndroid Testing guideAndroid testing pagesa. After a fairly long read, it quickly became apparent that the only thing that I could possibly get out of it is information about how to test the UIActivities. What I really want is the way to test my logic with simply codeant testcode, preferably without even involving the device. I should mention at this stage that I am not using Eclipse and its quite saddening that 99 of the Java resources on Android assume people do so. p  pIn any case, trying to get anything at all running, I played along with the tutorial as much as I could. It asks that a codetestscode directory is made on the same level as codesrccode. Sure, even if every other of their pages implies that the testproject is a completely separate entity. While in the top level project directory, I ran codeandroid create testproject m pathtomyproject n MyProjectTest p testscode. Its worth mentioning that they are very inconsistent with saying how they want things to be set up a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6859807iscreatingunittestsinaseparateprojectthecorrectapproachforandroid titlePath inconsistencyas seen on this questiona. Visiting the directory, I spot the default testing file. Heres where the issues begin.p  pTo my understanding, testing is done as follows build application, install go to tests, build tests, install run tests from the tests directory using codeant testcode or start them directly using codeadb shell am instrumentcode. This worked fine. I however have no desire to test the activity but just the logic which doesnt access any ViewsActivities.p  pChanging the default test to extend codeAndroidTestClasscode seemed to have work for a while. The tests were being ran but there were caveats cleaning codetestscode with codeant cleancode also cleaned the project directory code..testscode so it took forever to build tests in a clean environment which is necessary because codeant debugcode seems terrible at detecting changes but it worked and I was happy.p  pFew more tests later, I get codejava.lang.VerifyErrorcode on my only test class. Googling and Stacking around, it boiled down to either something wrong with external libs or something wrong with my class path. Im not using any external code.jarcodes so its probably my path. p  pIn any case, here is my question what is The Proper Way to unit test logic in Android applications with JUnit I cant find any resources at all concerning this all resources are either for testing the UI parts or for unit testing ordinary applications.p  pHow can I unit test my logic emonlyem This shouldnt even require a device to run on given that I dont need to use any parts of Android. Where do I place the tests What do I need to change so that running codeant testcode in my project directory will then run thosep

Negative 1644 pIve been a database developer for many years across many p[latforms, but this is my first heavy work in Oracle.  Ive been trying to figure out how to move a set of structures from SQL Server to Oracle for a week now and every path seems to end in a wall.p  pIn SQL Server, I have a query that takes a set of records and does some light calculation and then pivots the results to a temp table where a second query takes the temp table and does some fairly involved calculations and regrouping of the columns. These procedures are wrapped in a third query that calls the second one with different sets of parameters user entered to build a block of data for a graphing package.p  pSo, the question is  what is best practice for such a chain in Oraclep  pThe people here that use Oracle said the proper approach is to build a table and put the data in to the table and then pass that along. Surely this is wrong  I cant believe I have to build and maintain a database of empty tables to hold intermediate results of various calculations.  p  pI thought codesysrefcursorcode was perfect and built the first query that way I didnt care for the SQL having to be built as a string and then executed, but I could live with it.  But when I went to the second query, I couldnt loadmanipulate the codesysrefcursorcode as a table, but had to loop through assigning each of the values to a variable and then, after the calculation, reconcatenate the values in to a codesysrefcursorcode to pass to the next step. Surely this is wrong.p  pI finally conceded that I could live with some table objects that I would initiate as needed and then discard on completion. But now I cant find any material that would point to late instantiation. It seems that I still have to build the table separately and leave it out in the structures as an artifact.  p  pSo  whats the best approach in Oracle for chaining blocks of calculations and transformations on a dataset together Am I just not finding the right documentation Or am I going down the wrong paths  Or do I need to treat Oracle as a procedural language and just load the data to an array can you build an array and then, when Im done, push it back to a codesysrefcursorcode for release to the calling program.p

Negative 1644 pI have a flexSlider using it as a carousel showing three slides, with a total of 7 slides. I have setup my outer div wrapping the flexslider so that the center slide is centered in the screen and stays the same size as you resize the screen, and the outer slides stay the same size, but show from 0 to 100 of the slide depending on the size of the screen. So as you resize the screen the two outside slides disappear off the screen. This works fine. p  pI would like to add a class to the first and third visible slides that would set the opacity for those slides, and as the carousel transitions to the next slide then I would want to remove the class from the old 1 amp 3 slides and place it on the new 1 amp 3 slides.

Negative 1644 pIm developing an application using Java Runtime and JDODatastore for persistence on Google App Engine. Ive created a hierarchy of model classes using the completetable strategy, like thisp  precodePersistenceCapable InheritancecustomStrategy  completetable DiscriminatorstrategyDiscriminatorStrategy.CLASSNAME public abstract class A      ...   PersistenceCapable public class B extends A      ...   PersistenceCapable public class C extends A      ...  codepre  pJDO correctly persists entities of class B and C in a single table using a discriminator value. However, if I try to do thisp  precodePersistenceManager pm  PMF.getPersistenceManager B result  pm.getObjectByIdB.class, aKeyOfAnObjectOfClassC codepre  pwhere codeaKeyOfAnObjectOfClassCcode is a Key that refers to an object of type C whod have thought it, JDO returns an object of class B without batting an eyelash i.e. nothing strange appears on logs.

Isnt the discriminator value meant to be used for strongdiscriminatingstrong instances when performing queries like thisp  pThank you all p

Negative 1644 pJust an RampD question.  We need to develop an application that can be run in a browser that has the capability of performing some system checks to gather support information to be emailed to us.  These checks will include basic system information, but also will need to scan the filesystem and pull out version information about various DLLS, executables, and .NET assemblies that might be installed.  The idea being that we can direct a client to a page and have the application gather the relevant information needed for support, and potentially even populate some database fields. We need it to have as small a footprint as possible.p  pIve worked with ActiveX before, and know it is capable of these things, but particularly on modern systems security is a nightmare to get around, with a lot of people blocking ActiveX altogether.  Is Silverlight easier to deliver to clients  Does it have a lighter footprint  Is it even capable of doing these thingsp

Negative 1644 pHello there fellow programmers, I have found yet an other obstacle in improving shadow mapping. The question is that I am doing some shadow mapping, and can not find any suitable depth biases for it. Some time ago in my XNA project when I was doing it for the first time, I could set it up quite nicely on a terrain, and could find a suitable bias in no time, because, if no bias was set, such acne occured img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comO6AQt.png altShadow acne I was adjusting the bias until the shadows looked fine, that is the basic idea behind it as far as I could understand. This is the result what I am aiming for. Now moved on to DirectX 11, and set up a little scene later, and done some PCF shadow mapping. Then, when setting no bias, there were no such acne, but the shadows were disconnected, such as this sorry for ugly texturing img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcDSNP.png altDisconnected shadows It should have acne on the ground, and the shadow of the box connect to the boxs edge, but instead it is disconnected. When lowering bias to a negative, the gap starts to decrease, but soon the whole shadow map darkens before reaching optimal gap distance.p  pI am using the same shader code only extended by pcf filtering as on XNA, so I am assuming it is more to do with the api. Checking out the xna code, I can not even see what the renderto texture formats are, because they are hidden I guess.p  pIf anyone ever had this problem before, please help me achieve the shadow acne with a zero bias.p  pUPDATE This image shows the uneven shadowing on a plain flat quad the acne should be even across the whole quad, as it is on the terrain in XNA img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0pnB1.png altuneven acnep  pUPDATE2 I tried switching culling mode to cull out frontfacing faces during the depth render pass, that way the shadows ccan be adjusted a little better, because there is no floor rendered that would darken if bias is modified, but the shadows are still very uneven. Individual meshes shadows can be adjusted to look good, but then the others get messed up. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYBxdM.png altindividuals look good Somehow, I think, the depth buffer distribution is very uneven, because objects closer to the far plane get better results. Not even my clipping distances are bad, I think. The Shadow Projection is set to 12000 depth distribution in my scene, 1 meter is approximately 200 units, but somehow, accuracy is way off. I have tried depth texture formats of R32FLOAT and D24S8UNORM.p

Negative 1644 pI have a question, since I couldnt find any solution yet.brp  pSo I have this image, which is fully transparent in the center and partially on the border as you can see. What Id like to achieve is, the border should be transparent and the center should be red.But the border should be fully transparent. So in this case, white.p  pIm not sure if is this even possible with CSS or HTML, the reason why I need to do this in CSS or HTML because Im looping through the database, and every displayed record would have a different background color, but the border should remain transparent. So creating the whole image in 10 colors or more is not an option for me, because then the site might would be too heavy.p  pThank you very much guys,br Markp  pEDITbr a hrefhttpi.imgur.comyMRxtqY.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comyMRxtqY.pngabrbr So to be more precise, Ive created another image, what I want to achieve. At the start I got the 2 images on the left side, the first one on the top is fully transparent in the middle, and has 50 opacity on the border as you can see, so partially transparent. The second one is just an image, but the second image is always changing, like a slideshow.p  pThe other image to the right would be the final result, Ive set a gray background to be more visible. So what I have in my mind, is that possible What I want to achieve is to cut the slideshow images border like this. But I dont want to photoshop every image which is in the slideshow, so I was thinking, maybe I can achieve something similar like this with CSS. Im thinking in some zindex, or something. But thats not working, because I get an image like what Ive linked on the top.p  pThis is all I got a hrefhttpi.imgur.comg7xpgQG.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comg7xpgQG.pngabr My problem here is, I can see the image on the partially transparent border, Id like to get something similar what is on the first image on the right without the blue things of course, I couldnt cut it, Im not a designer P p

You can even mix leftclicks and rightclicks to enter edit mode.p  pThis is pretty annoying since you would sometime select a row and then rightclick it, then a second after the context menu appears, the row enter edit mode.p  pIs there a way to restrict either the NSOutlineView or the NSTextFields inside it, to only enter edit mode using the left mouse button in addition to pressing Enter while the row is selectedp  pThanksp

Negative 1644 pLinux n00b here. So about a month ago I installed emacs and the gccg compiler and have gotten started with programming. I found some code online for an echo server program, copied it and compiled it to test the networking functions. It compiled but then when I tried to run it I got the error message strongSegmentation faultcore dumpedstrong. When I looked carefully at the debugger details it was an error in the fwrite function. I linked the code to the library emlibstdc.aem upon compiling and creating the output file so it does make me wonder if there is some critical error in the actual library functions and I need to go back, find the function .c sourcecode, and then add them to the headers to make it work.

Negative 1644 pMy goal is to have four different groups of markers which could be three different colors in each group. I need to be able to turn onoff based on checkboxes on the top of the map Group 1, 2, 3, 4 along with a way to filter those groups by color Example Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Group 4 amp Red, Yellow, Green.

Negative 1644 pI have written a code in Modelica to train a feedforward twolayer neural network for my Master thesis. The code receives a vector of six elements u[nin] and provides an output vector of two elements y[nout]. When I translate the code in dymola, I receive an error saying that the dimensionality of the parts included in a specific line of code must be equal. Once I remove this particular line, the code is translated successfully. I really spent much effort trying to resolve this error but in vain Any help regarding the problem would be very much appreciated. p  pThe code can be found below Please note that the line which causes the generation of the translation error is marked with  in the code. p  precodemodel NNblock Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.RealInput         u[nin] Connector of Real input signals annotation Placementtransformationextent140,20,100,20,     rotation0 Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.RealOutput y[nout] annotation Placementtransformationextent100,10,120,10 parameter Integer nin21 parameter Integer nin6 parameter Integer nout2 Real wji[10,6] Real deltawij[6,10] Real bj[10,1] Real deltabjT[1,10] Real wkj[2,10] Real deltawjk[10,2] Real bk[2,1] Real deltabkT[1,2] Real E Real ek[1,2] Real yj[10,1]  Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.BooleanOutput Inputtrigger                                                annotation Placement     transformationextent100,46,120,26, iconTransformationextent        100,46,120,26 Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.RealInput eTau1 annotation Placement     transformationextent182,36,142,76, iconTransformation     extent10,10,10,10,     rotation90,     origin44,90 Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.RealInput eTau2 annotation Placement     transformationextent148,46,108,86, iconTransformation     extent10,10,10,10,     rotation90,     origin50,90 annotation Placementtransformationextent10,10,10,10,     rotation90,     origin50,90, iconTransformation     extent10,10,10,10,     rotation90,     origin0,90 algorithm  E1 wji0.5ones10,6 bj0.25ones10,1 wkj0.75ones2,10 bk0.6ones2,1 deltawijzeros6,10 deltabjTzeros1,10 deltawjkzeros10,2 deltabkTzeros1,2  while Egt0.01 loop Inputtriggertrue ywkjNeuralNetwork.Utilities.LogSigwjiubj[,1]bk[,1] yj[,1]NeuralNetwork.Utilities.LogSigwjiubj[,1] ek[eTau1,eTau2] E0.5eTau12eTau22 if Egt0.01 then  deltawij0.01utransposeyjones10,1yjekwkj0.9deltawij   deltabjT0.01transposeyjones10,1yjekwkj  0.9deltabjT   deltawjk0.01yjek  0.9deltawjk   deltabkT0.01ek  0.9deltabkT   wjiwjitransposedeltawij   bjbjtransposedeltabjT   wkjwkjtransposedeltawjk   bkbktransposedeltabkT else   break end if end while  annotation Placementtransformationextent140,44,100,84,           usesModelicaversion3.2, IcongraphicsRectangle       extent100,100,100,80,       lineColor0,0,255,       lineThickness1, Text       extent68,20,78,16,       lineColor0,0,255,       lineThickness1,       textStringTwoLayerNeural Network, Diagramgraphics end NNblock  codepre

Negative 1644 pSo, I am kind of a newbie in iOS  ObjectiveC programming.p  pMy company has a working app made by someone else and I am trying to get an understanding for everything in order to do some minor adjustments.p  pRight now, I have a problem I cant get around.p  pHere is the dealp  pI have a NavigationController and from my rootView I push other ViewControllers when someone selects rows in a tableView. Every step has its own ViewController.p  ptableView 1  tableView 2  tableView 3  tableView 4p  pIn ViewController 3 I added a UIToolBar in XIB with 3 buttons. That is the only place where the user can do actions. I added properties for the toolbar and the 3 buttons plus the 3 actions for pushing the buttons.p  pWhen the user selects a row in tableView 3, the navigationController pushes the ViewController with tableView 4.p  pThe ViewController of tableView 4 has no UIToolbar in XIB, but the Toolbar from tableView 3 is shown.p  pHow can I hide the UIToolBar againp  pI triedp  precode[self.navigationController setToolbarHiddenYES] codepre  pI think I am missing some kind of basic knowledge p  pI hope that at least some of you can give me a hint how to look at my problem the right way to get the answer.p  pThanksp  pMatthewp  pEditp  pI missed something reaaaaalllly importantp  ptableView 3 didSelectRowAtIndexPath is pushing the ViewController for tableView 3 AGAIN with other datasource.p  pSo it is basicallyp  ptableView 1  tableView 2  tableView 3 Item  tableView 3 Subitemp

Negative 1644 pIm looking for help with search algorithm for a problem. The problem can be simplified to the following. p  pWe have an object that can take certain attributes  X1, X2  XN. N is of the order of 5000. However a particular object takes a subset of these attributes say Xi .. Xj about 50. p  pA configuration is a particular subset of the attributes. There are certain configurations, numbering Z order of 0.1 million, that are optimal.p  pInputp  precodeConfiguration 1 X1, X2, X3.. Xf Configuration 2 X4, X6, X7, .. Xz   Configuration Z X10, X200 XN codepre  pProblem Given a certain object, ALPHA with a subset of attributes XiXj the goal is to find the configuration that is closest to this object. The configuration can be a superset of the object ALPHAs configuration. It could also be that no configuration has all of ALPHAs attributes. Closest is defined as the configuration that has the most number attributes of ALPHA. p  pThe nave solution I have basically does the followingp  precode1. Take each configuration 2. Loop through each attribute of ALPHA 3. Keep track of the configuration with maximum number of matches to ALPHA 4. Pop out the configuration maximum matches. codepre  pI think the nave solution is correct, however it is too slow. Is there an efficient way to do the search across the configurations Even approximate heuristic is fine if it is very fast.p  pAdding C, Java tags to see if there is software that does this.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1644 pI like to keep my local Git repos in my Skydrive folder so they sync nicely between machines and I always have an online copy. However, Ive recently run into problems after upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1.p  pSpecifically, I started getting errors that [hash] object was missing or corrupt. After debugging the issue, it turned out that Git was having difficulty with 8.1s new Skydrive integration into the file system. Specifically, 8.1 likes to list files as if theyre stored locally, but keep them online until theyre accessed. It turned out that right clicking my repo folder and clicking make available offline solved the git errors.p  pIs there some convenient git or windows setting that I can change to make this unnecessary Its not a big deal to make files available offline in fact, Ill probably do that anyway, but Id like to know if theres a neater solution.p

Some arguments are present in all three, some are specific to one or the other.p  pI have had the problem in the past that one of these gets modified without the others, and I dont immediately notice, so the deployed product ends up running differently to the debug launched versions.p  pIt doesnt help that code.productcodes are xml like files, while code.launchercodes store VM arguments in a string on a single line, so it is difficult to compare them.p  pFor instance my Product is created a code.productcode file containing things likep  precode   ltlauncherArgsgt       ltvmArgsgtDeclipse.pluginCustomization..configpluginCustomization.ini DmodeliveltvmArgsgt    ltlauncherArgsgt codepre  pAnd this is intended to have the same vm arguments as my live debug launcherp  precodeltstringAttribute keyorg.eclipse.jdt.launching.VMARGUMENTS valueDeclipse.pluginCustomization..configpluginCustomization.iniamp10Dmodelivegt codepre  pBut the dummy debug launcher should have some arguments which are the same, and others which are differentp  precodeltstringAttribute keyorg.eclipse.jdt.launching.VMARGUMENTS valueDeclipse.pluginCustomization..configpluginCustomization.iniamp10Dmodedummygt codepre  pSo, can I avoid specifying the same arguments multiple times in different Eclipse launchersp  pIdeally I would like to either default my launcher to the arguments in the product and override any argument which is different, or include just the common items in the product and have the differences in the launchers, but everything I have tried so far has failed.p
Negative 1644 pI am working with an app which uses codephpActiveRecordcode and mySQL to pull in data from a sensor network and plot it onto a number of flot.js graphs on the client.p  pThere are several timeframes the user can chose between to affect the range of data the graphs display. code2hrs, 24hrs, 3 days and 1 week.codep  pThe sensors post to the database every 60 seconds, so when plotting the graphs, the query pulls in all rows between codenow and DATESUBCURDATE  INTERVAL  DAYcode where  is either 1, 3 or 7 etc.p  pHowever this results in a massive number of rows being returned code60,000  for the full weekcode and is causing huge delays and server errors.p  pI know I can just massively increase the max memory available for queries in the codephp.inicode file, but this is hardly a good solution, and doesnt solve the issue of speed.p  pMy question is, is there a way I can easily select only every second or third row from the required date range depending on the length of the interval the user wishes to viewp  pIn C or Java I would do something like a modulo select to return alternate rows but I cannot think of a way to do this in the current framework.p  pAny ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.p
Negative 1644 pSomething of a strange question but lets see what kind of response it gets...p  pIf I code a console app VS 2013, .NET 4.5.1 and execute this line of codep  pcodeUri.EscapeUriString[codep  pI get thisp  pcode[codep  pHowever if I execute the same thing well, technically codeUri.EscapeUriString[.Dumpcode in LINQPad on my machine I get thisp  pcode5Bcodep  pTo further complicate things, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma112360381068266according to this posta codeUri.EscapeUriString[code should indeed return code5Bcode.The post was written on 27062012.p  pIm thinking that perhaps LINQPad is referencing an older DLL than that used by VS, but that would imply that codeEscapeUriStringcode has changed relatively recently, which I cannot find any record of. Does anyone have any ideas as to what could be causing this behaviourp

Negative 1644 pWe are learning about windows raw touch events in class using Visual Studios 2012 in C. I got my demo working and it does exactly what it is supposed to, which is drawing circles beneath your fingertips to detect that a touch event has been raised. But after a certain time has passed and if you are still pressing on the screen with the circles drawn the screen turns blue The circles still show but they are blue as well with black contours and I can still move them around.

Besides a running X11 server, three other tools must be installed     in order for the script to run.  Both are available as standard     linux packages and can be installed using the local package manager.     Each of these are assumed to exist within the users shell PATH.    a. chrome  basic browser with remote desktop extension installed    b. xdotool  general tool for simulating mouse and keyboard                     control events in a X11 environment.    c. xclip  general tool for reading from and writing into the                   paste buffer in a X11 environment.   2. The chromote script works by automatically performing the mouse clicks     that would be required to start up a chrome remote desktop session in     the standard fashion.  As such, it assumes a certain geometry of the     google remote desktop sharing page, as well as the way windows pop up     on the users desktop.

Negative 1644 pIm trying to create a view that takes a base table and joins it to information from multiple other tables and returns one row per row in the original table. For the sake of example, lets say Im matching college graduates to employment and graduate school data... because that is, in fact, what Im doing. Now, the issue here is that I can get multiple matches in the employment and graduate school data. People could work for more than one employer, or they could go to one grad school and then decide to transfer to another. This creates duplicate rows when I join, which then need to be eliminated through aggregation or some other means.p  pMy current solution is to do nested joinsqueries something like thisp  precodeselect ID, GradYear, maxSalary as Salary, case when sumcase when S.YearGradYear1 then 1 else 0 endgt0 then 1 else 0 end from      select ID, GradYear, sumcase when W.YearGradYear1 then W.Wages else null end as Salary     from              select ID, GradYear         from dbo.Students         where Graduated1      as G     left join dbo.Wages as W     on G.IDW.ID  as Inner left join dbo.GradSchool as S on Inner.IDS.ID codepre  pThis seems a bit ugly to me, especially if I want to bring in more data say, I now want to look for them in the military too. Is there a better way of accomplishing the joining If I just straight up join the three tables together, Ill end up double counting peoples wages if they have 2 grad school records, for example... Let me know if youve got a solutionp

If I switch to fullscreen mode the video plays fine. p  pAlso if I stream the same video from a web server it plays back fine embedded in webview  again using the same code. p  pSo it seems like it can cope with the video format and encoding in webview, but for some reason it does not work from the internal or external SD card. p  pHas anyone come across a similar problem and is there any solution p  pIs there a problem version 4.1.1 of Android or is this likely to be an issue with the device itselfp

Negative 1644 pThis is a popular question What is the most efficient in time complexity way to sort 1 million 32bit integers. a hrefhttpwww.quora.comSortingAlgorithmsWhatisthemostefficientwaytosortamillion32bitintegers relnofollowMost answersa seem to agree that one of the best ways would be to use radix sort since the number of bits in those numbers is assumed to be constant. This is also a very common thought exercise when CS students are first learning noncomparison based sorts. However, what I havent seen described in detail or at least clearly is how to optimally choose the radix or number of buckets for the algorithm. p  pa hrefhttpwww.quora.comSortingAlgorithmsWhatisthemostefficientwaytosortamillion32bitintegers relnofollowIn this observed answera, the selection of the radixnumber of buckets was done empirically and it turned out to be 28 for 32bits 1million integers. Im wondering if there is a better way to choose that number In Introduction to Algorithms p.198199 it explains Radixs runtime should be Big Thetadnk ddigitspasses, nnumber of items, kpossible values. It then goes further and says that given n bbit numbers, and any positive integer r lt b, radixsort sorts the number in Big Thetabrn2r time. It then says If b floorlgn, choosing r  floorlgn gives the best time to within a constant factor.... p  pBut, if we choose rlg1million20  8 as the observed answer suggests. p  pThis tells me that Im very likely misinterpreting the choosing of r approach the book is suggesting and missing something very likely  or the observed answer didnt choose the optimal value.p  pCould anyone clear this up for me Thank you in advance.p

Negative 1644 pHi I am new to Core data. I am having difficulties in reloading my child objects or the NSSet objects which is located on a second tableview.p  pSo I have two tableview controllers, the first one is Budget where I can add or delete a budget. Within that budget object it has a one to many relationship with Expense object So the Expense is the NSSet.p  pAfter when I tap into one of the budget cells, it takes me to the NSSet of Expenses, I then converted the Expenses NSSet into NSArray by using the allObjects method like belowp  precodeexpenses  [[currentBudget expenses]allObjects] codepre  pI then populated the table view controller and it shows me all of the individual expense available within that budget. I then have an add  bar button to add an expense into the current budget or call the predefined method that core data gave me codevoidaddExpensesObjectNSManagedObjectobjectcode p  pEverything is great and it can be saved. However.... once I saved I am not sure how to reload the NSArray of expenses as it is not like the fetchedResultsController. I am able to reload data on the first tablview once a budget was added because i used the NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate and implemented the changesupdateinsert etc methods.p  pSo my question is, how do I reload those set of NSArray objects I tried to add in viewdidappear code[[self tableview]reloadData]code but that didnt work for some reason.. But when I tap back to the first tableview budgets and tap back into the expense... it reloads.p  pMany thanksp

Negative 1644 pIm trying to layout a simple UI for iPhone using Xcodes Interface Builder such that you have a text box and button at the top, and a tableview immediately beneath it filling the rest of the available space. There will be a top bar that I need to allow for as well. For the life of me though, I cant figure out how to lay it out so that it looks good in the simulator. I also find it looks radically different between simulator and IB.p  pHere is what I currently have in IB. Notice how the top bar has space reserved, and the text box and send button is placed a solid inch or so below emthatem, with very little space between those two controls and the tableview below.

Negative 1644 pMy website is hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk PHP. I use Yii Framework as an MVC.p  pA while ago I wanted to run a SQL query everyday. I looked up how to run crons on Beanstalk and it seemed complicated to merge the concepts of Cloud and Cron. I ran into Iron Worker a hrefhttpwww.iron.ioworker relnofollowhttpwww.iron.ioworkera, and managed to create a worker that is currently doing its job fine.p  pToday I want to run a more complex cron Look for notifications in my database, decide whether to send an email, build an email template and send the email via AWS SES.p  pFrom what I understand, worker files are supposed to be selfcontained items, with everything they need to work. However, I have invested a lot of time and effort in building my MVC. I have complex models, verifications, an email templating engine, etc...  It seems very difficult to use the work Ive done to create an Iron Worker. Even if I managed to port all of my code to a worker which seems like a great deal of work, it means anytime I make changes to my main code I need to make sure the worker also has those changes. It means I would have a branch of my code. Even more so if I want to create more workers in the future.p  pWhat is the correct approachp

Negative 1644 pIm working with libevent for the first time and have been having an issue trying to get my application to not run until the read callback is called.  I am using bufferevents as well.  Essentially I am doing is trying to avoid the sleep in my main application loop and instead have the OS wake up the process via libevent when there is data to be read off the socket.  Anyone know how to do this  I found in an alpha build of libevent that you can set a base event loop to be EVLOOPNOEXITONEMPTY, but from looking at the libevent code that will just use up my whole proc I believe.  I also read on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1353118howtosetsocketstoblockingmodeinwindowsthisa question that it is a bad idea to set a socket to blocking on windows which is why I havent done that as a solution either. I will mark this with libuv and libev too since they are similar and might contribute to my solution.p
Negative 1644 pIm having trouble trying to work out what data structure to use for an assignment .p  pI have a main program and a Student class . The main program using Scanner to get input from the user that asks for 1. Number, 2 Last Name, 3 First Name, 4 Number of Subjects they want to enter data for.  up until this point im fine  i create the student object using this info in the constructor and place it in a vector in the main program. All fine up to here  it then goes on to ask for the subject number from a menu I display , the number of assignments to enter for that subject, then the homework marks and the exam marks for each assignment. This is where im having trouble. The way im trying is to create a method in the Student class that add to an arraylist  using a seperate method and arraylist for each piece of data i.e. one for the subject numbers, one for the number of assignments, on for HW marks, one for ex Mark. The reason im doing this is my previous code before I had a student class and vector I simply used arrays in the main code to store these before printing out to screen and my program logic is designed around this.  I can see though that it is probably not the best way and will get complicated for trying to get this info back and using it in the right order. I think I need some other way to store it , probably using a single data structure that will somehow hold the number of subjects, the subjects numbers, how many assignments each subject has and the hw and ex marks for each subject. So my questions is , what data structure would be best suited to this , that I can use in my class ,update with a method and easily read back in the data. I am just asking for suggestions I can research please and not any code as it is an assignment. Bearing in mind im a beginner and wont be connecting to a DB or anything , just something like arraylists, vectors etc although i dont think they are suitable  but i might be wrongp  pthanksp

Negative 1644 pI spent almost a whole day trying to get this running and finally decided to come to SO because there are going to be people here who have tried this p  pI would like to get an AmazonEC2 GPU machine running with rpud or another R GPU package, either a cg1.4xlarge or g2.2xlarge as those are the only two GPU machines AmazonAWS has. p  pThis post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20981019howtorunagpuinstanceusingamazonec2panelHow to run a GPU instance using Amazon EC2 Panela helped me realize that I couldnt just change my rstudioserver machine to a gpu machine as I was using an incorrect AMI. p  pStarted out with this AMI from Amazon CentOS 6 x8664  with Updatesbr So I decided I had to build my own and started following the directions here a hrefhttpwww.rtutor.comgpucomputingrpudinstallationhttpwww.rtutor.comgpucomputingrpudinstallationa. As well as a hrefhttpwww.louisaslett.comTalksGPUProgrammingBasicsGettingStartedHandout.pdfhttpwww.louisaslett.comTalksGPUProgrammingBasicsGettingStartedHandout.pdfa Louis Aslett is the same guy who has an amazing demo of using rstudioserver on an ec2 a hrefhttpwww.louisaslett.comRStudioAMIhttpwww.louisaslett.comRStudioAMIa. p  pBoth of those end up leading you to here a hrefhttpdocs.nvidia.comcudacudagettingstartedguideforlinuxindex.htmlpackagemanagerinstallationhttpdocs.nvidia.comcudacudagettingstartedguideforlinuxindex.htmlpackagemanagerinstallationa, so you can get the CUDA toolkit which seems to be a necessity for GPU computing. Some of the AWS machines already have a Cuda toolkit installed, however I figured I would follow the directions on my first try even though they are installed, sometimes the versioning of stuff hasnt been the same as some of the tutorials Ive found. So I follow those directions to a T and I end up getting a few errors like codenvidiasettings319.3730.fc18.x8664 cuda Requires libgdkx112.0.so.064bitcode when I try to run the examples with code cudainstallsamples5.5.sh ltdirgtcode. So I download all of those required packages. I try again and end up with rpud errors will detail those later.p  pemThis machine is Ubuntu12.04embr So of course I think, someone must have already built an AMI for this and find someone who did it with python. I might just end up using python anyway because of more speed bonuses, but at this point I want to get it working with R. Here a hrefhttpvasir.netblogopenclinstallingcudaopenclpyopenclonawsec2httpvasir.netblogopenclinstallingcudaopenclpyopenclonawsec2a is the link to the AMI instructions on how to build it from scratch if you want to. Of course, then you have to install R, which defaults to R2.14, so following this great post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16093331howtoinstallrversion30How to install R version 3.0a to get R.3.1.0 running because rpud requires RR.2.8. p  pFollowing the directions from the rtutor site listed above either from simply using codeinstall.packagesrpudcode or the code R CMD INSTALL rpudltversiongt.tar.gz code or by using the directions a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesrpudINSTALLhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesrpudINSTALLa, I get this messagep  precode installing source package rpud ... checking environment variable CUDAHOME...

Then running some of the sample code from a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesOpenCLOpenCL.pdfhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesOpenCLOpenCL.pdfa ALSO WORKED. p  pAt this point, the only question Im left with is, has anyone else succeeded with interfacing the GPU with R and if so, how did they do itp  pI will post my stepbystep as an answer, but would love to see other ways.p

Negative 1644 pIm working with a 32bit signed int, that should contain truefalse flags for 24 items, starting with an id of 1.

For example, starting with a flag int of 125831406, the expected resultleft compared to the  actual result right p  precode1  true   true 2  true   true 3  true   true 4  false  false 5  true   true 6  true   true 7  true   true 8  false  false 9  false  false 10 false  false 11 false  true ltlt ..     false 22 true  false ltlt 23     true 24 true   true 25 true   true 26 true   true   codepre  pThe trouble is, not every flag ends up with known discrepancies, and when it does, its not always on the same id, and the number of discrepancies always seems to vary between 1 and 2. p  pSo this tells me theres some other value at play. The good news is that theres two possibilities that I know of. First, is the entry id  which in the example is 307, and second is an additional 01 flag, which in the example would be 1. p  pThe bad news is, that Im woefully deficient in bitwise operations when it comes to flags, and my attempts have been all for naught. So while I certainly dont expect the right answer, some ideas on what to try would be most appreciated.p

Negative 1644 pIve been trying to create a ViewGroup that allows me to move its children around individually and at the same time lets me use pinch zoom. I started with a version that allowed me to move children individually in an absolute manner. Having a onTouchListner on every child and then changing that childs position in its LayoutParams. p  pWhen researching how to implement pinch zoom for my app i came across this blogg post a hrefhttpandroiddevelopers.blogspot.de201006makingsenseofmultitouch.html relnofollowhttpandroiddevelopers.blogspot.de201006makingsenseofmultitouch.htmla and this stackoverflow question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12479859viewwithhorizontalandverticalpandragandpinchzoomView with horizontal and vertical pandrag and pinchzooma. In these examples they use canvas.transform to move things around but this moves the parent and all of its containing children around. I want to move children around individualy but maintain the functionality in the above example that allows for zooming and maintains functionality for for instance buttons inside the children. p  pWhat is the best strategy to adress this Is there a way to use the examples but change them so they identify what child is being moved and then only transform the canvas for that particular child or do I need to use my old strategy moving children with LayoutParams if so how would you implement zoomp

Negative 1644 pCan someone clarify the exact difference between abstract data typeADT and concrete data structure. As I am reading the bookAnany Levitin, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, it states that ADT is a data structure plus set of operations on them. However, what confuses me is that, Arrays and Linked Lists also have some certain operations defined on theme.g adding element,deleting element and they are considered as concrete data types. Due to that confusion, I cannot decide a new data structure for mee.g heap, tree, binary search tree to be abstract or concrete by myself.p

Furthermore, I would also need to return the Response all the way to the view function and run codereturn verifycode, which will make my code prevent from execution of course.p  pOne possible solution would be a decorator that either returns an error or the view function after all asserts went through. However, I would like to prevent that, as I also need some of the values I am establishing imagine parsing one number after another and then having to pass a list of numbers.p  pAnother solution I could think of is to actually do use a decorator and make my function a generator, yielding the result of verify. The decorator is a loop over that generator and keeps going until a response is yielded.p  pBut in this post I am really looking for a more hackish way, to let the nested function return a reponse instead of the parent function and therefore prevent execution.p  pI will post my yield solution in a separate answer so you can get the picture p
Negative 1644 pIm running a IIS7 server on Windows 2008 R2 server.  The situation is that I sold a domain name.  I set up a new domain name, I did a global findreplace on all the files on the server and in all the records of the database to change all links and references from the sold domain name to the new domain name.  But Im thinking of the few that I may have missed.  Im wondering if there is a way I can catch these on the server level when the pages are served ... that would test each page and do a replace if the old domain name exists.  Maybe on the ASP classic parser andor HTML server.p  pTIA,p  pJayp

Negative 1644 pI am using the codedlnmcode package to build a finite distribute lag non linear model. I intend on testing the modelfit based on various lag levels to assess which lag is suitable.

Now I need to factor in the lags for each variable by calling codecrossbasiscode. This is where I am confused. The function as per the package documentation is of the format  codecb lt crossbasischicagoNMMAPStemp,lag30,argvarlistthr,thr.valuec10,20, arglaglistknotsc1,4,12codep  pmy doubts are  p  p1 in codelag30code is 30 of the same units as my response variable or will it be in the units of my predictor variable In my case, my lag is specified in days. I want to specify 5 days as lag before fitting the model. How should I pass the argument p  p2 Since I have already created my basis matrix for predictor variables using codeonebasiscode, how should I pass the arguments codeargvarcode and codearglagcodep  p3 I also wanted to extract the lagged values of my predictor variables ImpressionsA.x and ImpressionsA.y in their original units. The matrix itself is not helpful. It transforms everything into negative values on some other scale all together.p  pIve used tag codelmcode amp codeglmcode to the Q because codedlnmcode has not been created. p

Negative 1644 pI am implementing a very simple Android App, using Eclipse. An Intent is instantiated.

The two options are Video player and Web When I choose  Video Player, everything works as expected. The simple video demo runs just fine. It just works  Which is great.p  pHowever when I choose Web V4.0.4MB1 the .m3u8 playlist file is downloaded.  I assume this app Web is just the browser on my Android device and the download was the default action defined when it browser didnt know what else to do.p  pIs there someplace I can find a description of how  the Android Web application will handle the http session with the playlist file .m3u8 Rather than just running it and looking at the response.  Im not looking to have the Web application handle the audiovideo output, I just want to understand why it did what it did. Thanksp

Negative 1644 pI currently use the export from QC in excel file say file exportfromqc.xlsx  which I use as a source for data connection into another file say defectanalysis.xlsx.p  pData connection defined eg in defectanalysis.xlsx from a csv file allows to query the source file name each time I want to refresh the import. And this is very usefull when several users refresh the source file each on their laptop... so with a different path to source file local to their laptop.p  pUnfortunately, as the source file is exported from QC, I feel I have no choice but to define the data connection based on the xlsx file exportfromqc.xlsx.

Negative 1644 pWere trying to get a new version of our app using Autolayout, size classes and trait collections since thats what Apple seems to be pushing for.

Negative 1644 h2Link to all the code and how it worksh2  pa hrefhttpjsbin.comkuweze6 relnofollowWhere it worksap  pJust make the SUM or SUBTRACT functions anywhere. Then you can click in any boxes and it will highlight it, if you click it again in the console.log the numbers are supposed to dissapear. But they add on and on... Done doesnt work yet, but cancel does. Good luckp  hr  pBasically, the code is supposed to go through numbers that it recieves and when its found, it deletes the number that is inside a variable that stores other numbers. This occurs inside a table, so any number is added randomly. If something is clicked by accident, then this emhandyem little function is supposed to remove the info from the variable strongnumbersstrong.p  pWhen I take away the break inside the loop, it works better, which is unexpected. strongWithoutstrong the break it will delete numbers, but always leave strongonestrong number inside the numbers variable.

Negative 1644 pBefore I get started I would just like to say that Ive tried to put in some due diligence in reading about the rules of placing divs inline. I understand the difference between float and display inline, block, and inlineblock. I have tried targeting to a great degree of specificity the divs containing the content I would like to have inline, but with no results. Either I am missing the classid name that I should be targeting, or I am missing where the styling is being inherited from that is keeping me from getting my results. I am also not sure if it is a Drupal problem, though I dont believe it to be so. This is a views block, and I am using Nodequeue if that matters.

Negative 1644 pA beginners book on Java has the following code in it. This book also explains about exceptions very well, and since I understood how exception works, I got a question about the following code.p  pFor some reason if FileWriter class throws an exception, codewriter.closecode wouldnt be executed. Therefore I think the best place to close the writer object is in a finally block. Even prior to this I have seen many code written like this, where the resource will be closed in the try block itself. I think there is no point in doing so. Only when there is no exception the resource will be closed. p  pAm I wrong What is the best way to close resources in java. Should we never write code like the followingp  precode public static void mainString[] args          try          FileWriter writer  new FileWriterfile.txt          writer.writei am writing          writer.close        catchIOException e            ex.printStackTrace               codepre

Negative 1644 pneed some help figuring this out, ive got some code like sop  precode    q conngtquerySELECT  FROM table      whilearray2[]  qgtfetchobject     arraypoparray2    ifissetarray2[0]gtDATE      date0  array2[0]gtDATE else     date0    ifissetarray2[1]gtDATE      date1  array2[1]gtDATE else     date1    data DATE1 date0,DATE2 date1 codepre  pso you can see what the problem is , repeating stuff over and over , its horrible, im sure theres a clean way on doing it, but im not sure how, i tried using a for loop, but if 1 value was not set all other values would get the codecode set to them so it didnt work... what i need to end up having is something that increments the codeDATEcode equal to the occurrences inside the codearray2codep  pso that if codearray2code ranged from codearray[0] to array[4]code then inside the codedatacode array i would end up having codeDATE0  date0,DATE1  date1,DATE2  date2,DATE3  date3,DATE4  date4,DATE5  date5code hopefully that way if for example codearray2[7]code does not exists , it wont throw an error because inside codedatacode it would not exist... hope all that makes sense,  i can not find a proper way to describe this.p

Negative 1644 pI have created a two way communication between parent and child processes using two pipes. Parent and child write data and I was able to make them read the data from each other. Parent writes numbers 1 to 5, and child writes numbers from 6 to 10. But I want parent to start reading data the first, and then reading continues in this order switching from parent to child until all the data are read 6,1,7,2,8,3,9,4,10,5.

Negative 1644 pI have a script tag on an HTML page that references an external script URL. The HTML page and the script run on HTTPS URLs. However, the script creates an IMG tag which references an image that is on an HTTP URL. I dont have control over the script itself it is hosted by a third party. The problem is that the browser complains about loading HTTP content on an HTTPS page.p  pI tried the following p  ul liHiding the image using CSS display property  This still causes the image to load and the browser to complainli liChanging the SRC attribute of the image using JavaScriptJQuery  this doesnt solve the problem because the script and the image load first and then my JavaScript runsli ul  pThe image itself is not necessary, I can hide it or remove it. Also, if needed, I can host the image myself on HTTPS, but I still need to change the SRC attribute BEFORE the image loads. p  pAny suggested workarounds p
Negative 1644 pI would like to know if anybody has successfully Autowired an autopopulated emlistem of objects, injecting mocks, with Spring during the test phase of the build What I want to be able to do is emoverrideem Springs autopopulation of a list during test time and have it populated with mocks within a unit test, instead of the implementation classes. I have successfully accomplished this by specifying Resource within the code instead of Autowired, but then when I deploy the Spring web app, the autopopulation does not execute with Resource specified for my list its just empty. The oppposite happens when I specify Autowired on the list. The list is autopopulated when the app runs, but then I cannot populate the list with mocks when the unit tests run. It seems to be a catch22...p  pSo how do I use Resource on a List type and have Spring still do the autopopulation at runtime Has anybody done this successfully  use autopopulation at runtime, but substitute mocks into the list during the test phase If so, could you possibly post relevant parts of your test Configuration class Java annotations please, not XML. Thanks..p  pThis works for injecting mocks, but then autopopulation of the list doesnt kick in at runtimep  precodeResourcename  myServices private ListltMyServicegt myServices codepre  pAnd in my test configp  precodeBean QualifiermyServices public ListltMyServicegt myServices      ListltMyServicegt myServices  new ArrayListltgt     MyService mockService1  Mockito.mockMyService.class, Mockito.RETURNSDEEPSTUBS     MyService mockService2  Mockito.mockMyService.class, Mockito.RETURNSDEEPSTUBS     eventServices.addmockService1     eventServices.addmockService2     return myServices  codepre  pAnd then with the following, autopopulation is active all the time at runtime and during the test phase, but I cannot override and inject the mocks during the test phase with Autowired, as it ignores the myServices Bean definition from the test configp  precodeAutowired QualifiermyServices private ListltMyServicegt myServices codepre  pThanks in advance for any insight on this.p

Negative 1644 pI am trying to do the following I have a page with multiple divs, each of which contains a graph and a form element which contains a selector, which has a few options for how to configure the graph.  Right now, when a user submits the form on one of the divs, the graph in that div changes as it should.  But if the user decides to submit another form in another div, then the forms in all other divs reset to their original values, ignoring any selections the user made.  I want the selectors to be able to remember their values so that even if a form somewhere else on the page is submitted, none of the other divs get reloaded.br Essentially, submitting a form should only reload the div it is inside, and leave the other divs as they are.  From what Ive read so far, Ajax seems to be the solution to such issues, but Im not entirely sure how to incorporate it into my code.

Negative 1644 pIf I have a column of pointers in my Parse table, and I would like to download the codePFObjectscode the pointers are pointing to, I know I would use the code.includecode keyword. What Im unsure about is how the downloading works. If I have many pointers pointing to the same codePFObjectcode, will the same thing happen when it downloads, i.e. that only one child codePFObjectcode will be downloaded and all the pointers will point to it or will the child codePFObjectcode be downloaded multiple timesp  pAn example scenariop  ul liI am trying to find all posts with a certain hashtag. Each post has a pointer to the user that posted it. Some users posted multiple posts with the same hashtag, so there are multiple posts pointing to the same user.

SubControllers are incorporated into the various control element tag   implementations. You almost never write controller code in JSF,   because its all presupplied. So you only have to supply the View   templates xhtml and the Models backing beans. p      pA lot of people think that the action logic in backing beans makes   them Controllers. This is incorrect. A Controller is a component whose   sole purpose in life is to synchronize the Model and View. In JSF,   that task is performed by the FacesServlet and the controls. You may   have Validators and Converters performing adjunct functions, but the   actual synchronization updating is part of the JSF core.p blockquote  pI know MVC has many variants depending on if its a desktop application, web aplication etc. so its difficult to define MVC try to find two sources with identical explanation of MVC.p  pIm mostly concerned with Managed beans here. Are they M or C Managed beans are apparently used to retrieve data from Model layer the Model layer on the highest level of abstraction  big architectural picture as in BalusCs answer, that is EJB, JPA and DAO and store the result to be used by the view. Controller layer in MVC is the one responsible for handling commands from the view, communicating with model layer and retrieving data from the model layer. Is managed bean used to communicate with Model layer Yes, and it also makes the retrieved data available for the view. For me it belongs to controller layer, not a model, because it doesnt contain logic used to retrieve the data, or the data itself, but only calls the appropriate model layer methods take a look at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8459903creatingmasterdetailpagesforentitieshowtolinkthemandwhichbeanscopeBalusCs code samplea.p  pSo whats the source of my confusion Could anyone explain this once and for all  so that its clear for beginners in JSFp
