Positive 4948 pI would like to retrieve part of a documents using AltChunk in order to preserve image and formatting from the original documents.

I eventually would output to a file but not immediately.p  pUltimately, I do not have to use AltChunk, but I came across it as easy solution to preserve the image and formatting from previous documents to generate a combined document I tried using it to combined two complete documents, and I agree it was easiest solution for sure.

Negative 4948 pMy objective is to write a program which will call another executable on a separate computerall with win xp with parameters determined at runtime, then repeat for several more computers, and then collect the results.  In short, Im working on a gridcomputing project.  The algorithm itself being used is already coded in FORTRAN, but we are looking for an efficient way to run it on many computers at once.p  pI suppose one way to accomplish this would be to upload a script to each computer and then run said script on each computer, all automatically and dependent on my own parameters.  But how can I write a program which will write to, upload, and run a script on a separate computerp  pI had considered GridGain, but the algorithm is already coded and in a different language, so that is ruled out.p  pMy current guess at accomplishing this task is using Expect a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiExpect relnofollowwikiExpecta, but I have no knowledge of the tool.p  pAny advice appreciated.p

Negative 4948 pIve done a pretty decent amount of looking on the interwebs, searching for ways to improve the poor performance of my WPF DataGrid control.  I came across this little gem from a hrefhttpwindowsclient.netwpfwpf35wpfdgpreviewctrlinvestments.aspx relnofollowthis articlea, but I cant seem to find anything about it in the documentation.  Can someone point me to where in the docs I might find how to manipulate how Virtualization works in the WPF Toolkit DataGridp  blockquote   pVirtualization Extensions is one   control improvement which was designed   with DataGrid in mind. This feature   exposes hooks to enable writing a   custom panel which can handle   multidimensional UI virtualization. We   will use this feature to implement   Column Virtualization for the   DataGrid, and application authors can   use the Virtualization Extensions to   write custom virtualization panels   which handle horizontal and vertical   virtualization. For DataGrid, this   means that performance in scenarios   with hundreds or thousands of columns   will be greatly improved.p blockquote

Negative 4948 pThis is a behavior I noticed several times before and I would like to know the reason behind that. If you run the following program under the Visual Studio 2008 debugger, the debugger will keep breaking on the codethrowcode statement no matter how often you continue debugging.

The thing here is, on the simulator, it always appears at realtime when it switches scene Intro to GamePlay. But in the actual phone, I know it would be slower and take more time to switch. But before the player can see the GamePlay scene, the timer for the game starts to count, the player has 30 seconds to play the game, and then music also starts already before the screen appears. Then when it goes to the GamePlay screen, the timer will still be 30 seconds, but it actually passes few seconds. So that is why when the player sees the timer show 4 seconds  or sometimes 3 or 6 it already display that he loses. He would not know the timer actually started before he saw the screen.p  pI dont know how people solve this problem. Could anyone help me out.

Id like to estimate the parameters of a gaussian mixture distribution that is biased towards the samples with higher weight. In the usual nonweighted case gaussian mixture estimation is done via the EM algorithm. Does anyone know an implementation any language is ok that permits passing weights If not, does anyone know how to modify the algorithm to account for the weights If not, can some one give me a hint on how to incorporate the weights in the initial formula of the maximumloglikelihood formulation of the problemp  pThanksp

Was very simple to set up and provides more features than our previous solution e.g. the ability to get a list of all cached objects. This looked like a very good solution, but we recently started to see some issues creeping throughp  ul liMemory consumption, there is an issue where it isnt releasing memory well, the service was using 700M even though we only held 30M of cached datali liOccasional CacheExceptions trying to retrieve objects from the cache especially for larger cached objectsli ul  pSo neither solutions are spot on.

Negative 4948 pI have a bare bones ORM implementation, consisting of data mappers which load and persist entities. Each mapper internally manages an identity map for all entities read from the database, so that the same entity is only loaded into memory once. p  pI am currently implementing lazy loading for related entities using a proxy class that loads the related data only when a property on the entity is accessed. My problem is that the proxy class is not the entity itself and is only used if the entity is loaded indirectly via a relationship. So any  check comparing the actual entity with a proxy that loads the same entity will return false. My goal is to keep both the entities and client code unaware of the proxy objects.p  pThe proxy class looks something likep  precodeclass EntityProxy      protected entity     protected loader      public function constructEntityProxyLoader loader              thisgtloader  loader           protected function load              if null  thisgtentity                      thisgtentity  thisgtloadergtload             unsetthisgtloader                    public function getname              thisgtload         return thisgtentitygtname           public function setname, value              thisgtload         thisgtentitygtname  value       codepre  pAnd the mappers look something likep  precodeclass PersonEntityMapper       Find by primary key     public function findid              if thisgtinIdentityMapid                      return thisgtloadFromIdentityMapid                   data  ...   gets the data          person  new Persondata           Proxy placeholder for a related entity.

Be especially careful when testing for group membership. In Tiger a user can be in lots of groups many more than the traditional limit of 16 and groups can be nested. If you want to test whether a user is a member of a group, use kauthcredismembergid.p blockquote  pIf I were implementing an API function that can be called with different arguments in different contexts, I would pass in an opaque type i.e. a codevoid code and provide a set of functions to extract data from it. The functions change with the API, futureproof.p  pSo, can anyone provide insight as to why the authors might have chosen this design for the remaining arguments Is it purely speed kauth code paths are incredibly hot after allp

Negative 4948 pI am quite new to Common Lisp and programming, and Im trying to write a certain function that turns all nonnil args into an alist.

If amprest provided arg names it would be easy to filter out NILs with loop or mapcar, but since it doesnt, I cant see how to automate this.br Im totally interested in other solutions than the one described, if people think this way is unnatural.  p  pstrongEditstrong Below is an example of what I am trying to do  p  pAn object is created, with a nonfixed number of data pairs and some tags, e.g.p  precodeuser  someone   creationtime  getuniversaltime   colorofsky  blue   temperatureincelsius  32   language  Common Lisp ...   tags  one two three codepre  pThese properties i.e. keyarg names could be different each time. The new object will then be added to a collection I thought the array might work well since I want constant access time and only need a numeric ID.br The collection will hold more and more such custom objects, indefinitely.br I want to be able to quickly access all objects matching any combination of any of the tags used in these objects.br Since the array is supposed to store more and more data over a long period, I dont want to parse every item in it each time I need to search for a tag. Thus I also store the index of each object with a given tag in a hashtable, under the tag name. I have written this function, what I find difficult is figuring out how to collect the data and turn it into an alist or anything that I can easily parse, index, and store.p

Negative 4948 pIm trying to validate a form using a hrefhttpbassistance.dejquerypluginsjquerypluginvalidation relnofollowjquery validate plugina and Im having a hard time finding out if I can override the default validation method for displaying error messages. The default action seems to be to display the error message pertaining to a form field immediately after the invalid field.p  pInstead of doing that I would just like to highlight the fields with errors and display the list of errors at the top of the form.

Negative 4948 pI need a framework to transfer POJOs between two or more in a clientserver model Java programs over TCPIP. I need it to be as simple as possible but it must support several clients per server, and easy implementation of encryption is a plus.p  pSo far I have looked at Java RMI, JRemoting, AltRMI and NinjaRMI. Right now JRemoting looks like the best choice as it is simple and dont require strange and seemingly unnecessary extends and implements as most of the others do. No active development seems to be going on on any of them except a little on Java RMI. I dont know if that is because they are stable and dont need more development, or because these kinds of frameworks are just not cool any more.p  pThe POJOs are just bags of properties. I need the server to hold a static list of objects, and the clients must be able to 1 Read the list, 2 Add an object to the list, and 3 Remove an object from the list.p  pAny suggestionsp
Negative 4948 pI am a new Ruby user, and have searched the forums, and although there are similiar questions posted, I was unable to fully relate.  Hence, my question.p  pI have a site that has 2 different types of users with different and shared attributes Shoppers amp Stores Both should be able to login, but will have different functionality and navbar options throughout the site.  They will also share some functionality.  For example, both should be able to search data in the stores.  However, only Stores will be able to update the data within them.  p  pI originally created a user class with email, encryptedpassword, salt, etc..  I wanted to leverage the signup  login code.  But each type of user will additionally have functionality.  p  pI thought of having the following databasep  precodecreatetable users do t       t.string email       t.string encryptedpassword       t.string salt       t.timestamps end  createtable shoppers do t   t.integer  dollars    t.string   promoinfo end    createtable stores do t   t.string   address   t.string   city   t.string   zipcode   t.string   categoryid end codepre  pThen I would have a Shopper amp Store class that would inherit from the User class, gaining all the login  signup functionality defined there.  Or would it make more sense to simply have each Store amp Shopper have a User, and delegate the any authentication calls to it shopper.user.loginp  pAm I thinking about this correctlyp

This code is executed only as a callback once a button is pressedp  precodeif  mRecorder  null     mRecorder.reset     mRecorder.release  mRecorder  new MediaRecorder ifmViewer.hasSurface     mRecorder.setPreviewDisplaymViewer.holder.getSurface     Log.dTAG,Surface has been set  try      Log.dTAG,Sleeping for 4000 mili     Thread.sleep4000     Log.dTAG,Waking up  catch InterruptedException e      Log.eTAG,InterruptedException     e.printStackTrace  mRecorder.setVideoSourceMediaRecorder.VideoSource.CAMERA   mRecorder.setAudioSourceMediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC mRecorder.setOutputFormatMediaRecorder.OutputFormat.MPEG4 mRecorder.setVideoFrameRate12 mRecorder.setVideoSize176, 144 mRecorder.setVideoEncoderMediaRecorder.VideoEncoder.MPEG4SP mRecorder.setAudioEncoderMediaRecorder.AudioEncoder.AMRNB mRecorder.setMaxDurationMAXDURATIONTEST  String targetFile  sdcardwebcameratemp.mp4 File localFile  new FiletargetFile iflocalFile.exists     Log.dTAG,Local file exists else     Log.dTAG,Local file does not exist  mRecorder.setOutputFiletargetFile try      mRecorder.prepare     bPrepared  true     Log.iTAG,prepared     return  catch IllegalStateException e      e.printStackTrace              catch IOException e      Log.eTAG ,IOException     Log.eTAG,Message e.getMessage     StackTraceElement[] array  e.getStackTrace     forStackTraceElement element  array         Log.eTAG,element.toString       codepre  pThe important thing which I dont understand here is that whenever I put the video encoder to be strongMPEG4Sstrong it works. On the other hand whenever I put the encoder to be strongH264strong it just does not. The problem is that this piece of code is just part of a bigger project, and the rest of it kind of expects this video to be encoded with h264.p  pIm testing on a samsung Galaxy I7500, running on froyo by the way. And I think the Galaxy I9000 has the same problem.p  pThe puzzling thing for me is that according to this documentation right here a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguideappendixmediaformats.htmlhttpdeveloper.android.comguideappendixmediaformats.htmla, MPEG4SP encoding should not be supported at all, while H264 is supported since honeycomb. So why is it working with MPEG4SP at all and is it possible to make it work with H264p  pThe error I get is not really clear.p  precode0711 000140.626 ERRORMediaSource1386 Message prepare failed. 0711 000140.766 ERRORMediaSource1386 android.media.MediaRecorder.prepareNative Method 0711 000140.766 ERRORMediaSource1386 android.media.MediaRecorder.prepareMediaRecorder.java508 0711 000140.766 ERRORMediaSource1386 com.appdh.webcamera.MediaSource.prepareOutputMediaSource.java74 0711 000140.766 ERRORMediaSource1386 com.appdh.webcamera.MainActivity.startDetectCameraMainActivity.java312 codepre  pActually, the app is a little more complicated than just that, as it also does stream the video over LAN, but the part which I am concerned here has nothing to do with that.

Negative 4948 pI have a method that transfers data from one database to another and in the process creates new tables in the target database. The method is part of a stateless EJB Java EE 6, GF 3.1 so the container, by default, starts a distributed transaction when the method is called. p  pThe data transfer process essentially runs as two separate steps 1. read from the source database 2. write to the target database. If the read step fails then I dont want the write step to happen but if the write step fails and the read has been committed already I dont really care  Ill just throw the data away.p  pInitially I hit the problem that my data sources werent XADataSources so the container complained about that. I then converted them to XADataSources but it still failed because the write process which is into a MySQL database contains create table statements which cause an implicit commit and you cant do that in a distributed transaction.p  pThe solution Ive finally come to is to mark transfer method as TransactionAttributeType.NOTSUPPORTED and then place the read and write process into their own methods which are called by the parent transfer method.p  pMy question though is this do the read and write methods run inside their own transactions or does the NOTSUPPORTED propagate to them My guess is that they have an implicit TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED and so will start their own transaction but Im not sure and I think its important they are running inside a transaction.p  pIs this the best solution to this problemp

Negative 4948 pMy apps icon has a circular logo with a blue background. I included all the required icon sizes for retina, iPad etc. but I read several places that the iTunes Artwork image is optional but recommended so I did not include it, thinking it would look fine if any of the others were scaled up a little bit for the devices app store. But, now that its accepted, when I go into the app store, on the device or iTunes, it looks like they took one of the icons, made a really bad cut out of the circular part to get rid of the backround there are chunks of white pixels sticking off of the top of it now, then put it over a black background...

For other runs of the algorithm, the values will be different and might be closer together. So far there have been some good suggestions for approximations if an exact solution isnt practical, are there any other approximations for more general numbersmagnitudes of valuesp

Negative 4948 pIm building a little towerdefense game with some friends in Java. Now Im assigned with the logic for towers and at the moment Im trying to figure out how a tower has to turn to aim and  hit a target monster. Because a monster moves on while the tower is turning and shooting, it needs to aim for a future position. Ive implemented a function, which gives me the position of a monster at any time t and also a function, which gives me the smaller angle needed to turn to a monster, but now Im confused because there are three unknown variablesp  ul lit1 or angle the time or angle, the tower needs to turn the speed at which a tower can turn is givenli lit2 or shoot distance the time a bullet needs to travel to hit the target speed also given, constant.li lit3 or travel distance the distance the monster travels in the same time.li ul  pSo Im searching for a solution forp  precodemint1t2  mint3 codepre  pwhere the target monster is still in range of the tower. I already thought of calculating with the maximal needed turn and maximal possible range and then stepwise decrementing, but Im curious if there is a perfect nonheuristic solutionp

Negative 4948 pI was wondering, is it possible to run a multiwindow OpenGL application on more than one GPU simultaneously To be more specific, lets say Ive created an application with two windows each sharing its GL context between each other. Now if Id move one of those windows from display 1 running on GPU 1 to display 2 running on GPU 2, would this actually work Would sharing contexts alone do the trickp  pMy first guess would be no. And if this is really not that simple, is there a way to accomplish this I could also imagine that it depends on whether the two GPUs are controlled by the same driver or not or even worse, let the machine have an ATI as well as an nVidia card, both supporting different GL versions.p  pI would appreciate any insights on this topic, purely informational since I cant find anything after quick googling. Does anyone know the possibilitiesp  pEDIT By the way, unfortunately I dont have a machine with multiple GPUs available at the moment, so I would test around a little bit.p

Negative 4948 pim making a platform type of game. I made my main character a rectangle using the Rectangle class, as well as the platforms. The platforms are constantly moving upward on the screen, and when my character collides with the top of the platform, I want him to land and move at the same speed as the platform, otherwise, he should be falling. I got everything to work except the falling part. If i turn on the falling, it never stays on the platforms, but if I turn on falling, it works fine.

Negative 4948 pI have a problem with links on my website. Please forgive me if this is asked somewhere else, but I have no idea how to search for this.p  pA little background on the current situation Ive created a python program that randomly generates planets for a scifi game. Each created planet is placed in a text file to be viewed at a later time. The program asks the user how many planets heshe wants to create and makes that many text files. Then, after all the planets are created, the program zips all the files into a file worlds.zip. A link is then provided to the user to download the zip file.p  pThe problem The first time I run this everything works perfectly fine. When run a second time, however, and I click the link to download the zip file it gives me the exact same zip file as I got the first time. When I ftp in and download the zip file directly I get the correct zip file, despite the link still being bad.p  pThings Ive tried When I refresh the page the link is still bad. When I delete all my browser history the link is still bad. Ive tried a different browser and that didnt work. Ive attempted to delete the file from the web server and that didnt solve the problem. Changing the html file providing the link worked once, but didnt work a second time. p  pSimplified Question How can I get a link on my web page to update to the correct filep  pIve spent all day trying to fix this. I dont mind looking up information or reading articles and links, but I dont know how to search for this, so even if you guys just give me links to other sites Ill be happy although directly answering my question will always be appreciated .p
Negative 4948 pI created a program to simulate Baccarat card games. I would like to display the results in a Chart. For series I only need Player, Banker, Tie.

Negative 4948 pIn my example link below some of the background of the OUTER DIV magically disappears when the browser size goes smaller than the defined width of the INNER DIV 960px. The horizontal scrollbar kicks in, as expected, but when you scroll to the right you dont get to see the missing section of the image. I believe it has something to do with the INNER DIVs property of [margin 0 auto], because when the INNER DIV is taken out of the code, the OUTER DIVs background shows as it should it gets cutoff, but no scroll bar.p  pAnyone have any ideas why this is happening...and how to fix itp  pa hrefhttpryanderson.comstackoverflowbackground relnofollowhttpryanderson.comstackoverflowbackgroundap

Negative 4948 pI have been researching how to create a hybrid winform and CLI app... I started out my app as Winforms, now I am adding CLI to it...  It seems to work but has a few issues I want to figure out how to fix and have not been able to do so , probably due to my lack of experience with C.p  pIf i have output type in VS set to windows application, and use the code below i am able to run the winform portion for GUI, and also from command line am able to give it parameters and it works, well at least it outputs consolewrites i have coded in, i have a seperate c class file that has my main code so it is seperate from winform GUI and my eventual cli code, they both will just feed user input to this other main c class.. anyway here is the code.p  precode     [STAThreadAttribute]      [DllImportkernel32.dll]     static extern bool AttachConsoleint dwProcessId     private const int ATTACHPARENTPROCESS  1      static void Mainstring[] args              if args.Length  0                      Application.EnableVisualStyles             Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefaultfalse             Application.Runnew formMain                  else                         AttachConsoleATTACHPARENTPROCESS              climain cli  new climain             cli.startcliargs               codepre  pwell it works in gui, i can access my menus and create different win forms, moment i click a button to perform an action i get the following exceptionp  pSystem.Threading.ThreadStateException was unhandled by user code   MessageCurrent thread must be set to single thread apartment STA mode before OLE calls can be made. Ensure that your Main function has STAThreadAttribute marked on it. This exception is only raised if a debugger is attached to the process.p  pif i then change the output type to console application, it works perfectly in all manners in cli and GUI, BUT when it opens the winformGUI portion i get this ugly CMD window that will not go away.. here is the code i used, basically just what i started with before i added the above code.p  precode    static void Mainstring[] args                if args.Length  0                      Application.EnableVisualStyles             Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefaultfalse             Application.Runnew formMain                  else                                  climain cli  new climain             cli.startcliargs               codepre  pagain with my lack of knowledge on C i am hoping someone can point me to a solution . I would prefer to keep the app as output console application and find a way to hide the console that is opened when i start the winformgui portion.. thanks in advance.p

Negative 4948 pI have some questions about importing data from ExcelCSV File into SQL Server. Let me first explain the overall scenario.p  pWe receive data from multiple sources and in either ExcelCSV format. This data is to be imported into SQ Server into a table.

Negative 4948 pIn my experience with CUDA, I mostly preferred the texture memory with CUDA array references because of its 2D3D spatial caching mechanism and my input data could be arranged as a 2D texture most of the time. Now I have a problem at which I can model the input both as a linear array and a 2D texture. By the way, when I am talking about texture memory I always mean using it with a 2D CUDA array reference. I know that the coalesced access pattern is very important when using regular global memory if the threads in a warp read consecutive addresses with the base address aligned to a 64byte boundary, then the whole warp can be serviced with a single memory access coalesced access. I wonder, whether the coalesced access pattern is important for the texture memory, as well. I think it should not be, because the purpose of the texture memory is different it is optimized for 2D3D accesses which are close to each other and it updates the texture cache with the desired pixel and a few of the surrounding rows and columns, as far as I know. Therefore I think a consecutive access pattern for a row in the 2D texture memory would not be advantageous, it would probably pollute the texture cache with surrounding rowcolumn data and degrade the performance, in contrast. Anyway, this is only what I am thinking after reading the Programming Guide and other resources and I want to be sure about it Is coalesced access pattern important for the texture memory as it is in the regular global memoryp

Negative 4948 pThis is a long introduction for a short question, sorryp  pIm working with EF 4.3.1 Code First and Ive got the following modelp  precodepublic class Action      protected Action            public virtual int ActionID  get protected set       [Required]     [StringLengthDataValidationConstants.NameLength]     public virtual string Name get set      [StringLengthDataValidationConstants.DescriptionLength]     public virtual string Description  get set       public virtual ICollectionltRolegt Roles  get set       public virtual void AuthorizeRoleRole role              if IsRoleAuthorizedrole             throw new ArgumentExceptionThis role is already authorized, role          Roles.Addrole        public class Role      protected Role                    public virtual int RoleID  get protected set       [Required]     [StringLengthDataValidationConstants.NameLength]     public virtual string Name  get set       [StringLengthDataValidationConstants.DescriptionLength]     public virtual string Description  get set   codepre  pAnd my DBContext class, defined in some other class library, with many to many mappingp  precodepublic class myDB  DbContext      public DbSetltDomain.Actiongt Actions  get set      public DbSetltRolegt Roles  get set       protected override void OnModelCreatingDbModelBuilder modelBuilder              base.OnModelCreatingmodelBuilder          modelBuilder.EntityltDomain.Actiongt             .HasManyaction gt action.Roles             .WithMany             .Mapmap gt map.ToTableAuthorizedRoles       codepre  pSo, this works alright. But if noticing the method codeAction.AuthorizeRoleRole rolecode is easy to asume that the Role Authorization logic might be complex some alreadyauthorizedvalidation now, but could be any validation, right, which is a completely valid thing to have on a good old fashioned domain model. But... the Roles collection codepublic virtual ICollectionltRolegt Roles get setcode needs to be public, the getter at least, according to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarygg71512628vvs.10329 relnofollowRequirements for Creating POCO Proxiesa. That means that any client of the Action class could add or remove roles, bypassing any validation logic. And yes, I want lazy loading, change tracking, the works, so I do need proxies to be created.p  pRegardlles, I set out to test some ways in which Id be able to make this property codepublic virtual ICollectionltRolegt Roles get setcode a non public property, to later test for proxy creation. As the proxies generated subclass my own class, and as I trust my inheritors but not my clients, I decide to make the property codeprotectedcode like so codeprotected virtual ICollectionltRolegt Roles get setcode. But then, of course, I got a compilation error on the linep  precodemodelBuilder.EntityltDomain.Actiongt             .HasManyaction gt action.Roles             .WithMany             .Mapmap gt map.ToTableAuthorizedRoles codepre  pbecause now the property is protected and cant be accessed outside Action class or its inheritors, and certainly codemyDBcode context class is not one of those.p  pSo I needed to try and access the property from codemyDBcode class without it the property being made public. And I though of reflection. My context class looked like this thenp  precodepublic class myDB  DbContext      public DbSetltDomain.Actiongt Actions  get set      public DbSetltRolegt Roles  get set       protected override void OnModelCreatingDbModelBuilder modelBuilder              base.OnModelCreatingmodelBuilder          modelBuilder.EntityltDomain.Actiongt             .HasManyaction gt ExtractPropertyValueltICollectionltRolegtgtaction, Roles             .WithMany             .Mapmap gt map.ToTableAuthorizedRoles           protected virtual TProperty ExtractPropertyValueltTPropertygtobject instance, string propertyName              ifinstance  null             throw new ArgumentNullExceptioninstance, Cant be null         if string.IsNullOrWhiteSpacepropertyName             throw new ArgumentExceptionCant be null or white spaced, propertyName          Type instanceType  instance.GetType         PropertyInfo propertyInfo  instanceType.GetPropertypropertyName, BindingFlags.NonPublic          return TPropertypropertyInfo.GetValueinstance, null       codepre  pNotice the new method codeExtractPropertyValuecode, ant the call to it on the many to many mapping instruction. This sould work right The HasMany method is expecting a function that receives an Action and returns an ICollection of something Role in this case and thats what is getting. But no, it does not work, it compiles of courrse, but on runtime, I got and exception that was something like This expresion must be of a valid property like obj  obj.MyProperty.p  pSo ok, it needs to be a direct property and it needs to be accesible to de DBContext class. I decided to set my property to protected internal and to move my DBContext class to my Domain class library where all the entities are defined, which I really dont like that much, but which I liked better thant having my property being accesible by everyone. My property looked like thisp  precodeprotected internal virtual ICollectionltRolegt Roles  get set  codepre  pAnd my DBContext class like this, exactly as I first had it, only that it is now defined in the same class library as all the entities arep  precodepublic class mrMantisDB  DbContext      public DbSetltDomain.Actiongt Actions  get set      public DbSetltRolegt Roles  get set       protected override void OnModelCreatingDbModelBuilder modelBuilder              base.OnModelCreatingmodelBuilder          modelBuilder.EntityltDomain.Actiongt             .HasManyaction gt action.Roles             .WithMany             .Mapmap gt map.ToTableAuthorizedRoles        codepre  pAnd this works all right. So, now the only thing left to check was the creation of proxies, that is, having lazy loading and change tracking. Being the property protected internal instead of public I was afraid it might not work, but yes it did, all of it, and smoothly, really.p  pNow, here comes my questionrequest. If a navigation property does not really needs to be public for proxies to be created, protected is enough Im leaving internal out because I assume that only influences the ability to use that property for the relation mapping, why on earth the restriction on the expression to extract the property for the HasMany method, or better yet, since I understand the property must be a property of the type being mapped and not some random collection, why is not there an overload for HasMany which takes a string propertyName and searches the property for itself, even if it is not a public property. This would allow to have non public navigation properties, which in my point of view, go all the way to allow a neatly design object domian.p  pMaybe Im missing something here.p  pThanx a lot.p

Negative 4948 pIm creating some algorithms that are very performance heavy, e.g. evolutionary and artificial intelligence. What matters to me is that my update function gets called often precision, and I just cant get codesetIntervalcode to update faster than once per millisecond.p  pInitially I wanted to just use a while loop, but Im not sure that those kinds of blocking loops are a viable solution in the Node.js environment. Will Socket.ios socket.onid, cb work if I run into an infinite loop Does my code somehow need to return to Node.js to let it check for all the events, or is that done automaticallyp  pAnd last but not least, if while loops will indeed block my code, what is another solution to getting really low deltatimes between my update functions I think threads could help, but I doubt that theyre possible, my Socket.io server and other classes need to somehow communicate, and by other classes I mean the main codeWorldcode class, which has an update method that needs to get called and does the heavy lifting, and a codegetInfocode method that is used by my server. I feel like most of the time the program is just sitting there, waiting for the interval to fire, wasting time instead of doing calculations...p  pAlso, Id like to know if Node.js is even suited for these sorts of tasks.p

Negative 4948 pI have 3 tables in a MySQL database.p  pTable 1 say its called codeclientcode has information of a client codeclientid and clientnamecode Table 2 say its called codeusertoclientcode has information related to each client with the users of my system codeuserid, clientid and orderflagcode. p  pIn this table clients and users are repeated, order flag indicates that the user and client have unfinished business. A combination of userid and clientid can only be found once in that table, it means user 5 and client 3 is only registered one time.p  pTable 3 called codeorderscode keeps information about the basic information of an order codeclientid, userid, orderidcode. It keeps two different date type columns datestarted which keeps information of the date when they started to build the order and datesent which keeps the date when the order was sent to the operations area.p  pThe reason I repeat the information in two tables is because in table 3, user and client can have a ton of unfinished orders which are no longer available, but i need to keep for the company records.p  pSo, what i need to do is select the 4 last clients with unfinished orders without repeating the clients, and the id to that last unfinished order.

Never drops from 60fps as expected. p  pThen I tried it on my iPhone4S. Everything goes smooth at 60fps until I reach around 30 instances. Then it starts to drop very hard until it reaches 30fps. p  pAlso I have to add this for some reason Im having a lot of warnings from Nape SWCp  precodeDescription Resource    Path    Location    Type

Negative 4948 pIm writing a PHP REST API using DOJO jsonreststore, I know many are already out there but its mainly to get a good understanding of the concept. To check the results I connected the store to a datagrid and everything except for two things are working. p  pIf I delete an item from the store it dissapears in the datagrid but if I look in firebug in the store.index the deleted items still remains. This might be because that view isnt updatedp  pSecond is when I post a new item and the backend returns the newly created item  the generated id. The datagrid is updated with a new row only without my newly generated id. If I look in firebug in the store.index I see an item with my newly created ID as I expected but there still remains an item with a client side generated ID. The datagrid is showing the object without the id generated server side.p  pBut stuck here, any thoughtsp  pBelow I posted some codep  pAdding itemp  precodedojo.connectdijit.byIdaddLocation, onClick, function       var Location  locationStore.getConstructor                       var location  new Location      location.name  TESTLOC     location.description  TESTDESC     location.company  1     location.companyname  TEST      locationStore.save                      if SERVER[REQUESTMETHOD]  POST      putvars  jsondecodefilegetcontentsphpinput            location  new Location      locationgtsetCompanyputvarsgtcompany     locationgtsetCompanyNameputvarsgtcompanyname     locationgtsetDescriptionputvarsgtdescription     locationgtsetId14     locationgtsetNameputvarsgtname      headerHTTP1.0 201 Created, true, 201     headerLocation httplocalhostresttestlocation . 14     echo locationgttoJSON  codepre  pDeleting itemp  precodedojo.connectdijit.byIddeleteLocation, onClick, function       var location  locationGrid.getItem0      locationStore.deleteItemlocation     locationStore.save   if SERVER[REQUESTMETHOD]  DELETE      uri  explode,SERVER[REQUESTURI]             locationId  uri[counturi1]      headerHTTP1.0 204 OK, true, 204  codepre
Negative 4948 pi want to make a programme that counts the number of prime between certain numbers. i made a circular queue to save prime numbers. so basically, 2 threads find prime numbers and enqueue in the circular queue, and 1 thread takes out the prime numbers and count them. from my code, getprime and getprime2 does the enqueue thing and consumer does the taking out thing. the problem is, it doesnt count the prime number correctly. i think, in progress, even if the queue is full, one of the enqueueing thread tries to put the prime number in the queue so that prime number isnt put in the queue and its missed.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltpthread.hgt include ltmath.hgt  queue size define QUEUESIZE 1  a node in a queue typedef struct queue     int element[QUEUESIZE1]     int front     int rear     int count queue  make a queue queue q  pthreadmutext mutexlock pthreadcondt pcond  PTHREADCONDINITIALIZER pthreadcondt ccond  PTHREADCONDINITIALIZER  prime count int count0  prototype void initqueuequeue q int enqueuequeue q, int x int dequeuequeue q int qemptyqueue q int qfullqueue q void getprime void getprime2 void consumer  int mainint argc, const char  argv[]      pthreadt pthread[2] producer thread     pthreadt cthread  consumer thread     int status      initqueueampq      pthreadmutexinitampmutexlock, NULL     pthreadcondinitamppcond, NULL     pthreadcondinitampccond, NULL     pthreadcreateamppthread[0], NULL, getprime, voidNULL     pthreadcreateamppthread[1], NULL, getprime2, voidNULL     pthreadcreateampcthread, NULL, consumer, voidNULL     pthreadjoinpthread[0], void ampstatus     pthreadjoinpthread[1], void ampstatus     pthreadjoincthread, void ampstatus      printfnThe number of prime numbers between 1100000 dn, count      return 0   queue initialization void initqueuequeue q      qgtfront  0     qgtrear  QUEUESIZE1     qgtcount  0   int enqueuequeue q, int x      ifqfullq              return 1          else         qgtrear  qgtrear1  QUEUESIZE         qgtelement[qgtrear]  x         qgtcount  qgtcount  1         return 0        int dequeuequeue q  int x  ifqemptyq      return 1  else      x  qgtelement[qgtfront]     qgtfront  qgtfront1  QUEUESIZE     qgtcount  qgtcount  1   return x   int qemptyqueue q  ifqgtcount lt 0     return 1 else     return 0   int qfullqueue q  ifqgtcount gtQUEUESIZE     return 1 else     return 0   void getprime  int i, j loop counter int temp  0  fori2 ilt50 i      forj2 jltsqrti j              ifij0             temp             break                   iftemp0              pthreadmutexlockampmutexlock          ifenqueueampq, i1 queue full condition                      pthreadcondwaitamppcond, ampmutexlock             enqueueampq, i             printfdt, i                  else             printfdt, i         pthreadcondsignalampccond          pthreadmutexunlockampmutexlock          temp0   void getprime2  int i, j loop counter int temp  0  fori50 ilt100 i      forj2 jltsqrti j              ifij0             temp             break                   iftemp0              pthreadmutexlockampmutexlock          ifenqueueampq, i1 queue full condition                      pthreadcondwaitamppcond, ampmutexlock             enqueueampq, i             printfdt, i                  else             printfdt, i         pthreadcondsignalampccond          pthreadmutexunlockampmutexlock          temp0    void consumer  int isempty  while1      pthreadmutexlockampmutexlock     isempty  dequeueampq      ifisempty  1         count          else         pthreadcondwaitampccond, ampmutexlock     pthreadcondsignalamppcond     pthreadmutexunlockampmutexlock         codepre

Negative 4948 pI can open a video and play it with opencv 2 using the codecv2.VideoCapturemyvideocode. But is there a way to delete a frame within that video using opencv 2 The deletion must happen inplace, that is, the file being played will end up with a shorter time due to deleted frames. Simply zeroing out the matrix wouldnt be sufficient.p  pFor example something likep  precodevideo  cv2.VideoCapturemyvideo.flv  while True     img  video.read       Show the image     cv2.imgshowimg       Then go delete it and proceed to next frame, but is this possible      deleteimg codepre  pSo the above code would technically contain 0 bytes at the end since it reads then deletes the frame in the video file.p

Now name this 2 dates, the initial normalization factor.pli lipAdd the number of working days  week ends that fall in these weeks.p  peg to add 10 working days, we need to add 12 days. Since 10 days has 1 week that includes only 1 saturday and 1 sunday.     this is because, we are normalizing to nearest monday.pli lipAmortizing back p  pNow from the end date add the initial normalization factor for negative initial normalization and another constant factor say, k. Or add 1 if the initial normalization is obtained from a Friday, which happens to be 3.     If start date falls on Saturday and sunday , treat as monday. so no amortization required at this step.p  peg Say if initial normalization is from wednesday, the intial normalization factor is 2. Hence add 2 to the end date and a constant k.p  precodeThe constant k is either 2 or 0.  codepreli ol  pConstant definition p  precode    If initial normalization factor is 3, then add 2 to the resulting date if the day before amortization is wed,thu,fri      If initial normalization factor is 2, then add 2 to the resulting date if the day before amortization is thu,fri      If initial normalization factor is 1, then add 2 to the resulting date if the day before amortization is fri  codepre  pExample p  precode   Find the 15th working day from Oct,17 wednesday. codepre  pStep 1 p  pinitial normalization  2    now start date is Oct,15 monday.p  pStep 2 p  precodeadd 15 working days   15 days gt 2 weeks     weekends  2 2 sat, 2 sun      so add 15  4  19 days to Oct, 15 monday.      enddate  2, nov, Friday codepre  pStep 3a p  precodeenddate  enddate  initial normalization  4, nov sunday codepre  pStep 3b p  precodeenddate  enddate  constantfactor  4, nov, sunday  2  6, nov Tuesday codepre  pCross Verfication p  precode Add 15th working day to Oct, 17 wednesday   Oct,17  3 Oct 17,18,19  5 Oct 2226  5 Oct 29  Nov 2   2 Nov 5, Nov 6   Now the answer is 6, Nov, Tuesday. codepre  pI have verified with a few cases.

Negative 4948 pI am trying to estimate the pose and position of a satellite given an image of it. I have a 3D model of the satellite. Using either PnP solvers or POSIT works great when I pick out the point correspondences myself, however I need to to find a method to match the points up automatically. Using a corner detector best one I found so far is based on the contour I can find all the relevant points in the image in addition a few spurious points. However I need to match a given point in the image to the correct point in the 3D model. The articles I have read on the subject always seem to assume that we have found the point pairs without going into details about how to do so.p  pIs there any approach usually taken that can determine these correspondences based on some invariant features Or should i resort to a different method not based on corner pointsp

Negative 4948 pUser creates a codefoldercode in client and in the clientside code I hit an API to the server to make this persistent for that user. But in some cases, my server is so busy that the request timesout. The server has executed my request but timedout before sending a response back to client. The timeout set is 10 seconds in client. At this point the client thinks that server has not executed its request of creating a folder and ends up sending it again. Now I have 2 folders on the server but the user has created only 1 folder in the client. How to prevent thisp  pOne of the ways to solve this is to use a unique ID with each new request. So the ID acts as a distinguisher between old and new requests from client. But this leads to storing these IDs on my server and do a lookup for each API call which I want to avoid.p  pOther way is to increase the timeout duration. But I dont want to change this from 10 seconds. p  pSomething tells me that there are better solutions. p

Negative 4948 pI am a complete rookie in VBA. Please excuse me if my questions might seem stupid.  p  pWhat I want to do is to create a User form interface in Excel for extracting futures price data. I have around hundred different spreadsheet with futures prices named like 08012, 08011 and so on. I have similar spreadsheets with forecasts for the same futures and they are also named in the same fashion. I want to create such Graphical User Interface that one can enter stock symbol, date range and either forecast or real price and obtain the desired series from the correct spreadsheet. My biggest problem is that I am complete rookie in VBA so I do not even know if this is possible to solve that kind of problem in Excel.  p  pI have been reading some literature and I realized that I needed an User Form Interface with 2 text boxes one for stock symbol look ,the one for time range  as well as an option box to decide whether to display forecast or real price . But thats all I can not really understand how to pass the data user enters further in the program so Excel indeed fetches correct stock from correct spreadsheet.  p  pAny tips, links to similar problems would be very welcome  Sorry the problem description is unclear.

Negative 4948 pI have an existing app with an extensive C model that I would like to hook up to a nice, modern Windows 7 or 8 UI.  The current ancient UI for our app was developed in the early Windows XP  9598 era using pure Win32 API.  Our code is currently compiling  linking through Visual Studio 2010.p  pIt seems theres a lot of different development API standards on Windows  Win32, MFC, ATL, COM and .NET.  Over the past 14 years, my engineers have pretty much towed the Microsoft line  in 2001, it was MFC is dead  we must move to ATL we didnt.  Then .NET will REPLACE MFC it doesnt appear to have.p  pSo now were ready to dump our old UI code.  It would be nice to work with a set of standards that are solid and efficient, but also one we could create UI with quickly.  Putting aside QT  on which Ive read a lot of wellargued pluses and minuses here on stackoverflowp  p1  Would the modern UI development approach for Windows 7 amp 8 be to use MFC or .NET  p  p2  For a .NET approach assuming theres solid reasons for choosing .NET could we use our C model code UNMANAGED with a .NET appp  p3  Is it essential to do development in Visual Studio 2012, even if our app would not initially be design for a Metro appearance  p  p4  Are there any other Microsoft toolkits that should be considered for desktop app developmentp  pStephenp

Negative 4948 pI have created an IPV6 SOCKRAW socket to capture NA packet.

Negative 4948 pI am creating a simple webbased course scheduler for a department in our college and am currently developing the UI. I am creating it with jQuery UIs accordion and sortable extensions. I have it set so that you can adddelete courses and adddelete terms where the terms are all connected sortable ordered lists.p  pThe problem I am running into is when a term is already part of the html page, everything works flawlessly. However, when you add a term OL with jQuery, courses can be added but not removed. When you try to remove the course, you get the Object Expected error. Even if you drag existing li elements from another term, you still get the Object Expected error when you try to remove them from the new term.p  pMy thoughts are 1 I need to refresh the new term or 2 I am not initializing the new term correctly.

Negative 4948 pIm trying to write a simple toy program that uses the NSFilePresenter and NSFileCoordinator methods to watch a file for changes.p  pThe program consists of a text view that loads a hardcoded text file and a button that will save the file with any changes. The idea is that I have two instances running and saving in one instance will cause the other instance to reload the changed file.p  pLoading and saving the file works fine but the NSFilePresenter methods are never called. It is all based around a class called FileManager which implements the NSFilePresenter protocol. The code is as followsp  pInterfacep  precodeinterface FileManager  NSObject ltNSFilePresentergt property unsafeunretained IBOutlet NSTextView textView   void saveFile  void reloadFile  end codepre  pImplementationp  precodeimplementation FileManager      NSOperationQueue queue     NSURL fileURL    id init      self  [super init]     if self          selfgtqueue  [NSOperationQueue new]         selfgtfileURL  [NSURL URLWithStringUsersJonathanfile.txt]         [NSFileCoordinator addFilePresenterself]          return self    NSURL presentedItemURL      NSLogpresentedItemURL     return selfgtfileURL    NSOperationQueue presentedItemOperationQueue      NSLogpresentedItemOperationQueue     return selfgtqueue    void saveFile      NSFileCoordinator coordinator  [[NSFileCoordinator alloc] initWithFilePresenterself]     NSError error     [coordinator coordinateWritingItemAtURLselfgtfileURL optionsNSFileCoordinatorWritingForMerging erroramperror byAccessorNSURL url          NSString content  [self.textView string]         [content writeToFile[url path] atomicallyYES encodingNSUTF8StringEncoding errorNULL]     ]    void reloadFile      NSFileManager fileManager  [NSFileManager defaultManager]     NSFileCoordinator coordinator  [[NSFileCoordinator alloc] initWithFilePresenterself]     NSError error     block NSData content     [coordinator coordinateReadingItemAtURLselfgtfileURL options0 erroramperror byAccessorNSURL url          if [fileManager fileExistsAtPath[url path]]              content  [fileManager contentsAtPath[url path]]              ]     dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,          [self.textView setString[[NSString alloc] initWithDatacontent encodingNSUTF8StringEncoding]]         After this I implement every method in the NSFilePresenter protocol. Each one  simply logs its method name so I can see it has been called and calls reloadFile  not the correct implementation for all of them I know, but good enough for now.  end codepre  pNote, reloadFile is called in codeapplicationDidFinishLaunchingcode and saveFile gets called every time the save button is click via the app delegate.p  pThe only NSFilePresenter method that ever gets called going by the logs is presentedItemURL which gets called four times when the program starts and loads the file and three times whenever save is clicked. Clicking save in a second instance has no noticeable effect on the first instance.p  pCan anyone tell me what Im doing wrong herep

Negative 4948 pIm trying to do something very similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6989421afterasuccessfuldeviseloginhowtoredirectuserbacktopreviousactionththis questiona...p  pIn summary, I have voting logic on a page, but to vote, I require you to sign in.  The voting logic for a signed in user simply does a codemethod gt post, remote gt truecode call to a controller method, saves the vote, and does a coderespondto jscode to a JavaScript HAML template which replaces HTML using jQuery.p  pFor an unauthenticated user, this currently works such that the anonymous user clicks vote, is redirected to the Devise login page, logs in, and gets redirected back to the page they were on to vote again.  But, this is a bad user experience.p  pHow would I change this so that the last step simply continues to process their votep  pI have existing HTML views for the voting logic, and would prefer to simply continue the processing of the vote, redirect to the page where the user voted from, and flash a message saying the vote was successful.  However, if its just as easy to do this using JavaScript  jQuery, Id be open to this.  The only piece I want to avoid is recreating the Devise templates in JavaScript.p

Negative 4948 pI was doing some work with directshow recently and I noticed that it has kind of an interesting architecture. If youve ever worked with it, I think youll know what Im talking about. Its like any directshow object can be cast to any other directshow object. So, you can instantiate a filtergraph object, cast it to another object type to configure it, cast it to a media object to run the graph.p  pWhats the name for this type of architecture scheme. It seems to involve interfaces or something. Where can I find out more about it Id like to use it in some software that Im developing.p

Negative 4948 pstrongMy question is easiest explained with the code block and the questions below it.strong p  pBut here is an attempt to explain my question in Englishp  pI am learning JavaScript and I am lazy so I use a lot of jQuery...   and I came across something which I dont quite understand, and I dont know what it is called, therefore I dont know what terms i should research.p  pBasically I am wondering when it is necessary to use codefunction ... code without a name and when to use codefunction functionname ... code with a name, and how to execute a function with things like code.clickcode code.postcode or codesetTimeoutcode.p  pI know a couple of jQuery functions, like code.clickcode that require you to put in a function to be called. But the thing is, you cant just say code.click functionname code this would call the function immediately upon executing the script if I interpreted my test results correctly instead you have to do code.click function ... code or you can do code.click function functionname ... code. I also found out that you can say code.click functionname code as long as you define beforehand codevar functionname  function functionname ... code whereas the function name is optional, it will work with or without adding that.p  pI made an example with all possible scenarios I could think of. And I did find out what is working and what isnt, now I want to find out why each one is working and others arent.p  pI am hoping understanding this will help me better understand asynchronous functions such as code.postcode or codesetTimeoutcode.p  precodeltbutton idonegtButton 1ltbuttongt ltbutton idtwogtButton 2ltbuttongt ltbutton idthreegtButton 3ltbuttongt ltbutton idfourgtButton 4ltbuttongt ltbutton idfivegtButton 5ltbuttongt ltbutton idsixgtButton 6ltbuttongt ltbutton idsevengtButton 7ltbuttongt ltbutton ideightgtButton 8ltbuttongt ltbutton idninegtButton 9ltbuttongt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function alertthree         alertthree           var alertfour  function         alertfour           function alertfive         alertfive           var alertfive  alertfive     this will alert five right away, because we call to the function alert five, which does not return anything but creates an alert box.      var alertsix  function alertsix         alertsix           one.click function         alertone          this will work correctly.      two.click alerttwo      this will alert two right away, because...     it wont do anything else on click      three.click alertthree      this will alert three right away, because...     it wont do anything else on click      four.click alertfour      this will work correctly.      five.click alertfive      this wont do anything else on click      six.click alertsix      this will work correctly.      seven.click function alertseven         alertseven          this will work correctly.      function alerteight         return function            alerteight                    eight.click alerteight      this will work correctly            function alertnine        alertnine           nine.click alertnine       this will not work ltscriptgt codepre  ul listrongWhy will this script alert first five, then two, then three on startupstrong li listrongWhy will only buttons 1, 4, 6, and 7 work correctystrong li listrongHow would you describe the differences between the working buttonsstrongli listrongWhich variation would you use when and whystrong meaning when to give it a name, when to write the function in a variableli ul  pA Fiddle for the same a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netZfnaM5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netZfnaM5ap

Negative 4948 pIm currently researching the nature of JavaScript objects and arrays. I understand that in JavaScript being an objectoriented language, everything derives from object codecode.p  pIll go through my investigation, stepbystep to help understand my questioning here. After each assignment to the object or array, the comment beneath it illustrates the state of that variable after the assignment.p  pemIve tested everything here in the Chrome console.emp  precode These will be used throughout the example. var obj   var arr  [] codepre  pOkay, so I can assign things to the object in keyvalue pairs.p  precodeobj[a]  Hello World obj[b]  Goodbye World  a Hello World, b Goodbye World codepre  pIn this respect, I can also pass in numbers as a key emalthough Im not sure that this is good practiceem.p  precodeobj[1]  Another World  a Hello World, b Goodbye World, 1 Another World codepre  pIn the same respect, if I want to get back a value from an object, I can use the [] operator.p  precodeobj[a]  Hello World obj[1]  Another World codepre  pNow lets look at the array object. I can still use the [] operator, but this seems to have a rather odd implementationp  precodearr[0]  John arr[1]  Pam  [John, Pam] codepre  pAnd as with an object, I can use the [] operator to get a value back.p  precodearr[0] John codepre  pBut this is where it seems to get a bit odd...given the current state of my array, I can also do the following.p  precodearr[0]  Mark arr[1]  Helen  [Mark, Helen] codepre  pSo it appears that if I pass in a number as a string, JavaScript will convert this to an array index for me...but what happens when I pass in a nonnumeric key insteadp  precodearr[foo]  Samantha arr[bar]  Matthew  [Mark, Helen] codepre  pSo when I added a keyvalue pair to the array it had no effect on the array itself, but I can still get the value from that key back.p  precodearr[foo]  Samantha codepre  pSo my question here is why, and how does the array determine how to store data, either as a key value pair, or as part of the array itselfp  pMy gut feeling here is that because the array is technically a derivative of object, it inherits objects ability to store values as keyvalue pairs, but also allows values to be stored by index the nature of an array.p  pIf anyone has any insight into this, Id be glad to hear itp

Negative 4948 pI can normally install native extensions on my Windows 8 system with BitNami Rubystack Ruby 1.9.3p448.  Rubystack comes with DevKit integrated.  However, I cannot get ferret and other treat dependencies to build.  The errors look like compile errors, not make errors.p  pWhile I am specifying ferret in this context, several gems required by treat are experiencing these same errors, exactly.  So, it must be a systemic problem.  In fact, I located exactly the same issue occurring in GNUstep circa 2008 that was fixed in svn.  To this point, I have been unable to identify that fix.  That conversation occurs a hrefhttpsavannah.gnu.orgbugsfuncdetailitemampitemid22653 relnofollowHEREa.p  pOn ferret, Ive tried version 0.11.8.5, 0.11.8.4 and even 0.11.6 each getting basically the same errors as listed here.  Ive looked for alternatives like sdsykesferret but it seems currently unsupported from what I can tell.  The current ferret active fork appears to be a hrefhttpsgithub.comjkraemerferret relnofollowHEREa.  Again, the problem is systemic, affecting several treat prereqs.p  pAs these are dependencies of gem treat NLP, so I really dont want to consider nonPnP alternatives especially since several are breaking.  I am having to go through them one by one to get them up.  Treat tries to dynamically install them but doesnt lock version, either.  I hope it will work...p  pMy latest ferret attempt to install follows.  It is just the latest iteration of several attempts.  Searches in SO have found similar problems that were pretty old and Ive already attempted them. p  precodeDBitNamirubystack1.9.312gtcall gem install ferret version 0.11.8.5 platformmswin32  withrubyincludeD UsersRichardDownloadsRubyruby1.9.3p448 Temporarily enhancing PATH to include DevKit...

Negative 4948 pIm using Z3 to solve a system that consists of Boolean constraints on variables codeVicode as well as a constraint of the following formp  precodeL lt IfV0, T0, F0  IfV1, T1, F1  ...  IfVn, Tn, Fn lt H codepre  pwhere codeLcode, codeHcode, and the codeTicode and codeFicode are integer constants.p  pAlthough all the variables are Boolean, I found that the QFLIA solver was somewhat faster than the generic one, so Im using the former. My assumption was that Z3 was handling the constraint above by introducing new variables and clauses to implement adders in the obvious way. However, doing that conversion myself using MiniSat and passing the result to a SAT solver takes an order of magnitude longer than Z3 does. Thus, Im wondering what strategy Z3 uses to solve systems of the type described above  is it something other than the conversion using addersp

Negative 4948 pFor code practice and improvement purposes I am writing a simple game currently writing it generic enough to be a game engine.p  pI currently have numerous codesetIntervalcode calls running, namely each entity prefabplayer looking at keys held down, checking for collisions, updating position references etc. I was just wondering what sort of performance issues if any could arise from a high number of separate setIntervals. Their timing in relation to each other isnt important, so Im not worried about them falling out of sync they have slightly different intervals anyway, but would a single codesetIntervalcode that loops through all entities to run all the checks actually be more efficient My only worry with that option, is that the function could take longer than the interval time. Does creating new intervals create enough stress to be worrying about, when each one does quite a small amountp

Negative 4948 pI have been developing a client game. I have enabled game center from iTunesConnect, created leaderboards and also created InApps. But when I try to call them in the code, there is no response. Game Center is showing no items and in apps are giving any response i.e products are not loaded. Everything is correct, provisioning is correct, bundle id is setup correctly, game center and in apps are enabled. I tried the same code with my own game center and in apps and they worked fine. One thing missing in clients itunes connect is Contact and Tax Information. Is that the problem Thats why apple isnt allowing me to add game center and in apps Thanksp

Negative 4948 pVia a script I write a single set of latlong position information into a CSV file which updates meaningfully for me every 23 minutes.  I can of course successfully import that file into GE Pro and drop a placemark on the map.  Once having done that, I wish to save the map as a JPG.  No issues with the manual version of what I need to do...p  pHow can I automate the import of the CSV file and automate the saving of the resultant map as well  Each map will overwrite itself  can have same file name.   I dont see where google has any command line interface to do something like this...p  pThe final result will be, again, a map with the latest positioned placemark whenever I happen to access the jpg file.p  pThank youp  pI am aware of the Google Earth Fusion product.

This code works well for the first time. My addin has a control button I modifed the xml while writing the addin and so, when the addin is installed using the above code a button automatically appears on my excel ribbon, and then I can use my addin.p  pThe problem is when I try reinstalling my addin. When I update the code of my addin and try to reinstall using the above code, I get this error p  precoderuntime error 1004 Unable to copy addin to library codepre  pThis happens because the addin is not properly uninstalled before it can be reinstalled. And I have given up searching the web for a method to unistall an addin using VBA code. I couldnt find any simple solution.p  pRight now the only way to uninstall my addin is to do it manually. First I delete the addin from the Microsoft Add ins folder. Then I open Excel and it gives me a warning message that it could not find the addin. Then I go to Addin manager and click on my addin and then click go. Then on the list of addins I tick my addin and then excel says Addin not present. Delete from list and then the addin is finally deleted.p  pOnly after manually deletting the addin like this, can I reinstall my addin using the above code. Now this is really cumbersome, especially when I want to distribute the addin to other people. There has to be an easier way to update the addin without having to first manually deleting it.p  pPlease dont provide random answers or answers you think might be correct to this question. Also please dont tell me to try out this and that. Only if you know the correct solution, tell me about it. I have already tried a number of things to no avail. p  pThanks a lot.p
Negative 4948 pI am trying to implement an Onion architecture for a ASP.Net MVC 5 project. I have seen opinions that services should be injected rather than instantiated even though, correct me if I am wrong, the idea expressed by Jeffery Palermo a hrefhttpjeffreypalermo.comblogtheonionarchitecturepart3 relnofollowhttpjeffreypalermo.comblogtheonionarchitecturepart3a was that any outer layer should be able to directly call any inner layer. So my question is p  ol liCan the onion architecture work without IOC, and if yes, is it idealli liLets say we go with IOC, if the UI should not know about the actual implementation of domain services, should we apply the same principle to the domain models themselves e.g. injecting models into the UI instead of referencing them directlyli ol  pI am understand why some solutions apply IOC on domain services but are accessing the domain models directly in the controllers.p

Negative 4948 pI have a fragment which contains an codeExpandableListViewcode. I would like to be able to select and delete items by emgroupem.

If I select my delete button, the item is deleted. All good. p  pHowever, the problem arises when I attempt to select emmultipleem groups in the CAB mode. It just doesnt work. If I click a second group, that group is expanded not selected. I want to be able to just highlight multiple group items without any expansion occurring. p  pTheres quite a lot of code to get this working, but Ill try to show some pertinent bits. The main issue is getting a list of selected group items.

Negative 4948 pI currently have a UISplitViewController. I have 5 rows in my master view controller and each of the row when tapped will place its respective detail view on screen.

For example, I have filled out the data needed in the firstviewcontroller, and then I tap the second row to show the secondviewcontroller. When I tap the first row again, I would like to have the instance of the firstviewcontroller that I already have finished filling the data in. kind of like how the Settings app worksp

Negative 4948 pIm trying to implement the observer pattern in C. What I attempting to do is to declare an observer interface with a single pure virtual method notify, and then let the the observers implementderive that interface.

Sadly Im having some trouble with the vector of pointers.p  pThis is the observer interfacep  precodeclass LocationEstimateObserver  public virtual void notify  0  codepre  pI have two different classes implementing this interface.

And yes, I understand that in this simple problemscenario, the DataGrid data is not hierarchical.. I just pasted the above as an example of how I am currently using the TreeView so call up different classes for the DataGrid... emdisregard if this is unintentionally confusing the issueemp  pBut with a WPF DataGrid, it in my case, at least only lists the instances of a single EntityClass based on the TreeView node clicked. Not that the above matters technically, what each layer of the TV clicked means is that a List within that particular class needs to be in the DataGrid. Trust me, it sounds more difficult than it is.

Now unfortunately, Classes A, B, C, ... are all emveryem different classes, with precious few columns in common. This means I cant use one single template in the DataGrid to display them all. p  pId be peachy with either of the following or another approach I cant imagine right nowp  ol liIn the codebehind I apply a template to the DataGrid I already know the class clicked in the TreeView in codebehind, so I have what I need to choose dg columns, or...li liIn the XAML for the WindowDatagrid I lay out the column layouts for each class to be represented Class A, B, C, ... a la strongAutoGenerateColumnsFalsestrong and somehow WPF figures out which to use.li ol  pstrongPossibly Irrelevant Notestrong p  pI cant display all the columns for each ClassEntity as they are in the DB. I only need like 12 the columns for the user, and the only thing the user will do with the data in the DataGrid is checkingunchecking 2 columns Checked and Active, and updating. In some rare cases, deleting an entire row in the DG will happen, but that is a special case I can deal with a number of ways later.p  pWhat Ive researched disheartinglyp  pI emcouldem use WPF layered DataGrids, and call up the right one to the top of the stackvisible, but that sounds hokeyawful... There must be an elegant way, and Im hoping you can mention any pointers, or even actual experience dealing with displaying different classes in a single DataGrid...

Negative 4948 pIve just learned that its going to be pretty tough for me to realize an app that can send a push notification to another device, BUT is it even worse to send it from strongAndroidstrong to strongiOSstrong respectively strongiOSstrong to strongAndroidstrong  I know its possible because codeWhatsAppcode does it, but okay, WhatsApp...  The way I need it is, on Phone A codeAndroidcode a user clicks on a button Send ring to user B codeiOScode.  When A clicks that Button, an codeAlertDialogcode codeUIAlertViewcode shall appear on user Bs screen.  Thats just to describe what I want to do, it obviously wont only send a ring.p  pAny suggestions or good tutorialsp

The server asks the user how many clients will be serviced and creates a as an array with that many rows. These function calls are ideally supposed to work for any number of clients.p  pIn this function call, the column that holds the current state is examined for each client. If any client is in the state represented by integers 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, then the function returns a 1. Else, the function returns a 0. This function is depicted below.p  precodeint incompleteint a[][11], int clients      for i  0 i lt clients i          if a[i][1]  0  a[i][1]  1  a[i][1]  2  a[i][1]  3  a[i][1]  4              return 1                   return 0  codepre  pThe function making the call is the condition for a while loop to continue looping.

Send in an array with 33 integers nothing huge, just 3 clients by 11 columns of info, a single integer denoting the number of rows, then return a single integer for comparison.p  pFunnily enough, a similar function with similar parameters functions just perfectly fine.

Negative 4948 pI know that GPU is efficient for rendering triangles. GPU cant render NURBS surface directly.  From the link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14907454nurbsintheopenglgraphicspipelineNURBS in the OpenGL Graphics Pipelinea,  we know that. To render NURBS, triangulation is required. I dont know where  triangulation operation occurs. Is it performed by CAD modeling software or GPU I guess this is done by CAD modeling software.  So the triangulation functionality of NURBS surface is one core task for any CAD modeling software  Is this task very complex or is solved almost completely by academic researchersp  pWhy do I have this question I find that NURBS surfaces are smooth in CAD modeling software However  if I convert the NURBS surface to triangle mesh first and open it by MeshLab. In MeshLab, some  regions are not smooth. I hope to know which part in the pipeline causes the problem.p

Negative 4948 pI noticed that displaying a codeFolderBrowserDialogcode resulted in assemblies from any shell extensions loaded on my computer to be loaded into my applications codeAppDomaincode.  This was a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq235551461730559causing problemsa for my application as an old version of a library my application uses was being loaded.  I thought that a potential fix for this would be to open the codeFolderBrowserDialogcode in a different codeAppDomaincode and then unload the AppDomain to unload all of the shell extension assemblies loaded. For examplep  precodepublic class Form1  Form      public Form1              var setup  new AppDomainSetup                      ApplicationBase  System.Environment.CurrentDirectory,             DisallowBindingRedirects  false,             DisallowCodeDownload  true,             ConfigurationFile  AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetupInformation.ConfigurationFile                   var ad  AppDomain.CreateDomainFolderBrowser, null, setup         var type  typeofMyFolderBrowserDialog         var diag  MyFolderBrowserDialogad.CreateInstanceAndUnwraptype.Assembly.FullName, type.FullName         diag.ShowDialog         AppDomain.Unloadad        public class MyFolderBrowserDialog  MarshalByRefObject      public DialogResult ShowDialog              using var diag  new FolderBrowserDialog                      return diag.ShowDialog                codepre  pThis didnt work though. The shell extension assemblies are still loaded into the applications normal AppDomain and werent loaded into the new AppDomain as Id expected would happen.  As a test I created my own class which calls the native codeSHBrowseForFoldercode function in Shell32.dll and found that making that call was what was causing the assemblies to be loaded.p  pSo if sandboxing with AppDomains a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma33690491730559only works with managed codea, how do you sandbox unmanaged code called with PInvoke  I could see this as being a potential security issue if you are running untrusted code or at the very least a reliability issue as there is no way for you to know what assemblies might be loaded on a customers computer just by opening a save or browse dialog.p

Negative 4948 pIm designing a component API. The domain is mostly asynchronous in nature calling a web service, so it makes sense to design the API as asynchronousp  precodetypedef void HSKBooleanResultBlockBOOL succeeded, NSError error  void addConsent HSKSessionConsent consent completion HSKBooleanResultBlock completion codepre  pThe problem is that the asynchronous API makes it quite inconvenient to do some things. For example all tests have to use semaphores in order to wait for the component to finish. And if I want to chain several calls to the component, I have to nest the callsp  precode[service addConsent completionBOOL succeeded, NSError error      if succeeded          [service addConsent completionBOOL succeeded, NSError error                        ]      ] codepre  pNow even something as trivial as adding several items from a container is painful, even in a situation when I would be perfectly fine with a blocking call. Some APIs dodge this issue by offering both synchronous and asynchronous API. For example Parsep  precode[query findObjectsInBackgroundWithBlockNSArray objects, NSError error ] NSArray results  [query findObjectsamperror] codepre  pThis is quite easy to do, but it feels a bit like writing boilerplate code.p  pAnd then there are other solutions like a hrefhttpsgithub.comReactiveCocoaReactiveCocoa relnofollowReactive Cocoaa or a hrefhttpsgithub.comBoltsFrameworkBoltsiOS relnofollowBoltsa that make it easier to chain async calls, but are too much magic to be worth it for me. I could also only offer synchronous calls and let the caller dispatch the call on a background queue, but that feels like bad API design.p  pAre the other choices or even best practicesp

I have a table that looks like that  p  precodeTable User  UserId UserName UserPositionX UserPositionY UserPositionZ codepre  pIdeally, I would like to bind the fields into this structure The array is to be coherent with another API that Im using clientside  p  precodetype User struct      Id int64     Name string     Position [3]float64  codepre  pWhere codeUserPositionXcode binds to codePosition[0]code, codeUserPositionYcode binds to codePosition[1]code and codeUserPositionZcode binds to codePosition[2]code.p  pIm open to use a structure like this one instead of an array  p  precodetype Vector3 struct      X, Y, Z float64   type User struct      Id int64     Name string     Position Vector3  codepre  pBut then Im facing two problems  p  ul liI dont want to separate the codePositioncode fields in another table. All orms that I looked seems to consider that 1 struct  1 table.li liThis structure have to be converted marshalled into json. In this json, I need the position to be an array example  codeid 42, name Foo, position [6.3, 8.6, 2.65]code.li ul  pSo my question is  Is there an available orm for go and sqlite that is capable of binding multiple columns in an array or struct without creating another table  If its not possible with an array, is there a way to customize how a specific type is marshalled into json p  hr  h1EDITh1  pI found a way to change how a specific type is converted into json. I just need to add two methods to the given type. In this example  p  precodefunc p Vector3 MarshalJSON []byte, error      return []bytefmt.Sprintf[v,v,v], p.X, p.Y, p.Z, nil   func p Vector3 UnmarshalJSONdata []byte err error      , err  fmt.Sscanfstringdata, [v,v,v], ampp.X, ampp.Y, ampp.Z     return  codepre  pResult  p  precodetest,   json.MarshalUser3, fooBarBaz, Vector342.0, 35, 23.45 fmt.Printlnstringtest  gt Id3,NamefooBarBaz,Position[42.0,35,23.45]  test2  User json.Unmarshal[]byteId3,NamefooBarBaz,Position[42.0,35,23.45], amptest2 log.Printlntest2  gt 3 fooBarBaz 42.0 35 23.45 codepre  pMy initial problem still exists because I tested some orms in the list and the only thing I found is by embedding structs, and I need the codeVector3code to be an attribute.p
Negative 4948 pA few months ago I created a project that uses the pythontesseract library on the raspberry pi. Since then I reinstalled rasbpian, and now I would like to reinstall the pythontesseract libary. The problem Im having is that the library doesnt install anymore on the raspberry pi.

Negative 4948 pIm creating an iPad application that Ill use to conduct surveys among employees. This application will contain multiple UIViewControllers. p  pWhat Ive done so far p  ol lipI created a Survey class. This class contains properties for fields that Im going to be filling in as the survey progresses. Basic things like Name, Email Address, Age, etc. pli lipI created a subclass for UIViewController called SVViewController. In that class, I created and initialized an instance of Survey called survey after importing the Survey class. pli lipI went to each of the UIViewController classes that i already created and associated with a storyboard view and changed their inheritance so that they inherit from SVViewController. pli ol  pIm still very new to all this, and Im having trouble figuring out how Im going to proceed. I want the instance of Survey again, called survey to contain all the data as the user fills it in. When somebody enters their name in the first view, I want it to communicate back to that instance of survey to update the name. I then want to go into the next view and pull that value of name from the instance of survey. p  pBasically, I need survey, this one instance of Survey, to persist throughout all views. I found an example online regarding a singleton pattern, and I started with that, but Im having some trouble. Before I go any further, I will paste some code p  precodeSurvey.h     import ltFoundationFoundation.hgt     interface Survey  NSObject     property nonatomic, strong NSMutableString name     property nonatomic, strong NSMutableString emailAddress     end   Survey.m     import Survey.h     implementation Survey     end  SVViewController.h     import ltUIKitUIKit.hgt     import Survey.h     interface SVViewController  UIViewController      Survey survey          property nonatomic, retain Survey survey     idsharedManager     end   SVViewController.m      import SVViewController.h     interface SVViewController      end      implementation SVViewController     synthesize survey     idsharedManager         static SVViewController sharedSVViewController  nil         synchronizedself             ifsharedSVViewController  nil                 sharedSVViewController  [[self alloc]init]                  return sharedSVViewController           id init         ifself  [super init]             survey  [[Survey alloc] init]                  return self           voidviewDidLoad          [super viewDidLoad]          Do any additional setup after loading the view.           voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning          [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]          Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.          end codepre  pIm sure this is kind of a mess, and I tried toying around with it for a long time. I think that whats happening is that the single instance of Survey is being created, but when I try to do things like setting values to the properties of Survey name, emailAddress, etc and then rewrite them to check to see if they changed, Im just getting nulls back. Im assuming that this is because Im not initializing the property anywhere, but Im having a lot of trouble figuring out where to do it. p  pThank you in advance. p

Negative 4948 pSo heres something Ive never seen and cant see why... I have a ruby on rails up with an established db via rails migration files. Some of these migration files have indexes on them.

I then ran dbmigrate and the schema updated like usual. p  pBut I noticed that some of my indexes had separated from other db tables. Separated meaning index on code[userid, productid]code changed to two sepearte indexes, ie code[userid], [productid]code.p  pAnyone know why this happened Rails version didnt change, ruby version didnt change. No new gems were added. Literally nothing has changed except the one new migrarion file.p

I seem to have trouble to load or find the deployed text files.p  pThe text files I have deployed on the android in the remote strongassetsinternalstrong folderp  pI am currently testing this on my Nexus 5, and have no other device available for the moment.p  pThe load code goes as followsp  precode  Load Parts    slParts  TStringList.Create   slPartsOutput  TStringList.Create      try       slParts.LoadFromFileTPath.GetDocumentsPath  PathDelim  Parts.txt       cdsParts.DisableControls       cdsParts.Open       for iParts  0 to slParts.Count 1 do        begin          cdsParts.Append          split9,slParts[iParts],slPartsOutput          cdsPartsNumber.Value  slPartsOutput[2]          cdsPartsName.Value  slPartsOutput[3]          cdsPartsCategory.Value  slPartsOutput[1]          cdsPartsWeight.Value  slPartsOutput[4]          cdsPartsDimensions.Value  slPartsOutput[5]          cdsParts.Post        end      finally       cdsParts.EnableControls      End  codepre  pThe curious thing is it works fine when I compile this on my Windows 64bit tool with the same code. Just it seems to have trouble loading it on the application. Where exactly can I find this assets folder on my device so I might check wether the files have been written Is it that maybe I need to create a folder If so, what code do I use to create a folderp  pstrongThe full errorstrongp  blockquote   pException class EFOpenError with message Cannot open file datadatacom.embarcadero.MyProjectfilesParts.txt No such file or directory Process MyProject.apkp blockquote  pEditp  pI think it has to do with my phone itself. When trying to create an empty folder, it does not allow me to. I will try on the SD card and report backp  pEdit2 p  pI am still stuck. The files are not being deployed on either WIndows nor Android. No wonder the files cannot be read. I will investigate for further causes, but help is always welcome.  I am trying to deploy in my documents folder on Windows, without succes.p

Negative 4948 pThis is a bit of a funky issue that I have been looking into today and Im hoping someone can help shed some light on it for me.p  pI am developing a PyQt4 GUI in both Python 2.6.1 and 2.7.6 on Windows.p  pThe GUI uses multithreading to separate the filesystemdatabase processes from the GUI so everything will stay interactive during longrunning tasks. Things worked as expected when tested in Python 2.6, however when testing in Python 2.7 I have encountered massive stuttering and freezing when my filesystem thread is doing any work. p  pInitially I thought it was a PyQt issue but I have been able to reproduce the stuttering with Python threads directly. I have isolated it down to a change between Python 2.7.2 and Python 2.7.3 although Im not sure emwhatem change.p  pI wrote a simple 2thread example emusing both thread and the threading moduleem to demonstrate how the OS calls in one thread interrupt the other emwhich is the GUI in my caseem.

Negative 4948 pAfter creating a repository containing some binary files yes codegitcode indeed doesnt handle binary files that well, but this is a repository where the binaries are mandatory files, performing a commit becomes kind of bloated.p  pWhen one performs a codecommitcode the memory usage of codegitcode reaches code2.7 GiBcode. Sometimes the process is even killed by the operating system because it uses all remaining system resources.p  pThis is probably due to the internally used codediffcode algorithm that requires to take both the original and the new file into account and needs to take at least one of the files into memory the second can be handled as a emstreamem.p  pIs it possible to emmarkem a file as embinaryem and specify that the repository doesnt need to calculate the difference, but only check for a new version this can be done by handling both files as streams, thus in constant memory. After all, the storing the difference is probably as inefficient as copying the new version.p  pcodegitcode repositories are maintained on the machine automatically. It would thus be nice, if the process could be automated and thus use for instance the MIMEtype of the files and mark all binary files automatically.p

Negative 4948 pIm looking to create a GUI that supports simultaneously  1. data recording 2. showing selfupdated images 3. send commands to a control board Arduino  where all 3 functions could change state at any time. p  pIm only in the testing stage so to put things simply, i want to be able to have a MATLAB client running, and throw at it 3 different functions that doesnt interrupt each other and can run in parallel. And very importantly, a user can specify when they start, at different times and at will.p  pIve tried using parfor and batch processing. Parfor obviously doesnt support tasks that can start a random times, they all must all start simultaneously. Batch processing the same thing. p  pDoes anyone have any idea what function I should use Ive looked into spmd but im getting strange errors when even when im trying do something like thisp  precodematlabpool3 spmd    run one empty file    j  batchrecorddata, 1, 11 end matlabpool close codepre  pwhere it gives the error Unable to write to MATfile, does spmd not support batch file  But most importantly im really not sure if spmd is the solution here.  Could anyone share some insights on how i should tackle this problem thanksp

Negative 4948 pIve been assigned to write a program which then calculates the Laurent series of a function using Python. Ive already found a library called a hrefhttpsympy.org relnofollowSymPya for symbolical computations in Python but the problem is I have no idea how should I produce the Laurent series in the program. Of course Im familiar with the concept, but Ive always calculated the Laurent series in an ad hoc way using Taylor series, never used an algorithmic method. Id be grateful if someone helps me in finding an algorithm to produce the Laurent series using the inputs mentioned in the question below p  precodeGiven a fractional function containing polynomials in both numerator and denominator find its Laurent series in all convergence domains. The polynomials are given by its zeros. For example, the function  z1ziz2z1z1 is given in the input as    10i    01i      00i    00i    10i    10i  The first sign  or  defines the sign of the fraction.  The output of the above example is the Laurent series around z00 in two convergence domains zlt1 and zgt1. codepre

Negative 4948 pOkay, so this is emnotem a specific what am I doing wrong coding question, sorry. If its better suited to one of the other stack sites, let me know.p  pToday I was fired from a contracting gig where theyre using Symfony2 and Doctrine. Im a senior programmer, but not very experienced in either of these two frameworks  though I felt sure I could get up and running fast. After all, its PHP  what could go wrongltcynicismgtp  pMy assigned teammate brought on as a Symfony expert, so I was at first perfectly happy to watch and learn kept insisting that entities should be immutable, and emallem custom business logic should go in repositories. Reading the documentation the getting started guide, no less this simply seems to be untrue  repositories are for custom getters, but data manipulation goes in entities Doctrinespeak for models. Made perfect sense to me a database cant know if bitflag 1 means active and 2 confirmedEmail, but the guy was adament. When pressed for an example of how I should add custom data editing methods in a repository since I fooled around for a bit but couldnt get Symfony to see them without going through hoops and manually replacing entities with repositories, he sent a code sample implementing a more or less manual update query. strongThen why use an ORM in the first placestrongp  pHe also repeatedly stated that one should never touch entities, since changes might get overwritten when theyre regenerated. Apart from the fact that Doctrine seems to normally assume you write entities and generate the database scheme from those  not the other way around  unless my knowledge of the English language is mysteriously failing, the manual seems to clearly state that when regenerating entities, existing methods are left alone so its perfectly safe.p  pEnd of story, client decided we couldnt work together and chose the other guy. They also had this weird argumentation where I was the most expensive guy on the project and I wasnt providing enough seniorness. I did point out that telling others theyre simply wrong and getting yelled at for it true story, well, they were typing in ALL CAPS which counts as yelling in my book didnt make me very happy either, so that was that  I wished them the best of luck and we went seperate ways.p  pAm I losing my mind here Am I missing something glaringly obvious Or is the other guy simply misguided my current working theory as to what belongs in entities and what in repositories Anyone experienced in DoctrineSymfony care to elaborate Id be happy to provide more specific examples of what we were supposed to be building. Im mostly extremely curious to learn the right waytm of doing things in these frameworks for future reference, they didnt quite whet my appetite yet, if there indeed is a better way to abstrahate model code away from entities.p

Negative 4948 pIm using a Vagrant VM created by Puphpet, running Ubuntu 14.04 for the purpose of developing a Wordpress site. I use Composer to manage PHP dependencies, and Composer is installed automatically as a system service via Puphpet, so there is no .phar file, just an executable Composer file in codeusrlocalbincomposercode. p  pI also use PHPStorm as my main IDE, and love its Remote Interpreter feature. So far, PHPUnit is the only feature that supports it, as Composer and PHP Codesniffer requires having a local PHP interpreter installed in order to be used. This kind of defeats the purpose of the ComposerPHP Codesniffer tools within PHPStorm when used with Vagrant. Jetbrains claims they have no plans to add this feature in the near future.p  pWhich leads me to my question Would it be possible to set up a shared folder to the PHP executable file in my VM, and use that as my Remote Interpreter in the Composer Settings window p  pCould I also do the same to my PHPCS executable file path in the Code Sniffer settings panel with PHPStorm p  pThe only one I wouldnt be able to set up a Shared Folder to is the composer.phar file which is needed to run the Composer tool within PHPStorm, because there is no composer.phar file within my VM, as its just an executable in codeusrlocalbincomposercode as I described earlier. So would the solution be to download a composer.phar file to somewhere within my host directory Will this interfere the Composer install on the VMp  pUpdate As Sven has explained to me, the Composer file in usrlocalbincomposer is the composer.phar file. I kind of understood this, but still am not sure if a.

Negative 4948 pI have been told an entity called tableloader in a database, database1 in SSMS version 2008 R2 exists and needs to be fixed.  It is not obviously a stored proc.  Its purpose is to convert an excel spreadsheet to table data.  Is there any easy way to search a database for an entity name in SSMS.p  pThe find function appears to work only with text SQL files as opened in SSMS.p  pSince originally posting I have found out from a colleague that this entity is a DTS package however, I believe searching a database for a name is still a useful thing to be able to do, especially if you dont know what layer the entity is in with respect to the database folder structure.p  pThanks.p

Is this possible I know that SQLAnywhere can communicate with other databases, but can mysql do itp

Negative 4948 pSo, Ive been hunting for a solution for this for awhile and have come up with what sort of works ... but I cant help feeling that there must be something more elegant.p  pWhat Im looking for is to be able to extract existing data from a populated database amp incorporate that data into loading scripts.

It depends on various assumptions e.g., that the Table Name will have a Primary Key of Table Name  trailing s and plus ID that may not hold true for every solution.  It also requires cutting amp pasting, and rerunning from the start when the table structures change.p  pThis is probably quite a lot of background ... which Im partly sharing because I couldnt find anything similar out there amp thought that somebody might benefit from this.  However, I still come back to my real question, which is to say wheres the tool to generate this kind of script for VS Database Projects  There really should be something  something that would take into account whatever the primary key is, that would generate the thing entire, etc.p

I can easily accomplish this during runtime modepli lipMy control allows the developer to set certain parameters during the loading phase of the control.

Negative 4948 pThrough much pain, I actually found the answer to this, but none of the searches I used came up with an answer.  I tried to register this solution in the ArchLinux community, but I really couldnt navigate their community support sites to submit it there.p  pI figured out that the heart of the problem is that makepkg uses fakeroot to implement the steps that actually build the packages, which in tern used chroot.  At first I thought maybe it wasnt supported in docker, but if you run a container with the privileged flag, you can use chroot.  No doubt this probably gives the container root access to the docker host system so you want to be careful about running containers in this mode.p  pIt looks like docker doesnt have support for running privileged steps in a Dockerfile, but there is an open ticket that should be added in a future release.p

Negative 4948 pI am new to JS, HTML and CSS development and I tried to develop a hovering function for my webpage. However, I am facing the problem that nothing is being displayed when hovering over the links and the divs created for the specific hovering textboxes are appearing on the page even if not hovering.p  pI used The code fragments below to reach this. First I have some CSS this should be generic, so I can use it for different hover divs. I am not sure, if I wrote everything correctly. Secondly, I have a JS code for the hovering function. Then you see the divs I created for the different hover textboxes. These divs appear on the webpage even if not hovering. Do I need further if statements to indicate that these should only be displayed when hovering. Lastly, I added the link I use. Maybe someone could also tell me how I can bring away the blue part of the link, but this is currently only a minor problem.p  pFirst the CSS code Could you tell me the error I am doing here probably I want this code to be generic as well.
