The Container usercontrol that conatins the itemcontrol binds each book item in the collection as expected name, description etc., However the command event of the save button in the itemcontrol is not raised when clicked.  The button save all that is not part of the itemcontrol functions as expected containerviewmodel raises the command event.  I expect that each press of save of each book itemcontrol will raise command event inside bookviewmodel.p  pI understood that by default, the ItemsControl will create an ItemTemplate for each item in the collection, and set its DataContext to the item from the ItemsSource, so it seems I should change the datacontext of the Command save inside the ItemsControl.ItemTemplate to point to BookViewModel.p  pin case needed solution is uploaded top  pa hrefhttpsonedrive.live.comredirresid3A8F69A0FB413FA4120ampauthkeyADbkhAdl44Hb6Toampithintfile2czip relnofollowhttpsonedrive.live.comredirresid3A8F69A0FB413FA4120ampauthkeyADbkhAdl44Hb6Toampithintfile2czipap  pSome code snippet p  pstrongUserControlsstrongp  pa.BookControl Displays book details and has a button save.

Positive 378 pAt work Ive suffered from quite a few memory leaks in a Silverlight 5 project so I thought Id run an idea by you for resolving this issue.p  pThe idea stems from implementing a Dispose pattern across all view models. One area in particular I think is a major headache as far as memory leaks are concerned are events, and therefore I believe this solution should address this nicely.p  pThe way I think about it is that this should allow 1 and only one subscriber to subscribe to events at a time. Meaning that the same object shouldnt be able to subscribe for the same event twice and having the subsequent side effects.p  pSecond, since I keep a reference to the subscribers of the event  when dispose comes around I can get rid of those references, regardless of the fact that the EventHandler internally keeps the same references. I get a chance to unhook the event completely by unhooking all of its subscribers and thus preventing the pesky memory leaks.p  pDoes anyone think this will introduce issues in the app I mean its rather large and I dont want to push experimental stuff without researching a bit more.p  pThanksp  pStart with the codeDisposableObjectcode base classp  precodepublic class DisposableObject  IDisposable    private bool disposed  false  to detect redundant calls     ltsummarygt    Default constructor    ltsummarygt   public DisposableObject       ltsummarygt    Object that inherit from this base class should override this method instead,    since its called from the Dispose method by the base.    ltsummarygt    ltparam namedisposinggtltparamgt   protected virtual void Disposebool disposing        if disposed            if disposing                 disposeonly, i.e. nonfinalizable logic                shared cleanup logic       disposed  true             ltsummarygt    Destructor    ltsummarygt   DisposableObject        Disposefalse        ltsummarygt    Implementation of IDisposable.

Positive 378 pWhat I need to do is stop GridSplitter before going far beyond and thus hiding the TabControl. So the idea that hit upon my mind is to Bind the sum of ActualWidths of all Headers of TabItems to the MinWidth of TabControl or the Crid Cell keeping the TabControl. But the problem is I am unable to access the Width of Header of TabItem so far. One solution I found was place a TextBlock inside Tabitem.Header, declare its width and name it with xName. But using the width this way doesnt gives the total Width of the Header the includes margins and paddings etc, thus it doesnt work even near to accuracy.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pWell, here is the code.

Positive 378 pFollowing situation I got a little helper which shows the user what settings are wrong. In this particular case its a textbox which specifies the output path. An adorner highlights the textbox by drawing rectangles of halfopaque rectangles around it. Now Id like to disable hit tests for the are which is grayed out, so that the user can only use the control that is highlighted. Another adorner shows a cancel button in the right lower corner of the application which allows to cancel this highlighting mode.p  pIs it possible to deactivate hit tests for all other controls or might it be possible to specify a codeGeometrycode which filters hit tests Ive seen you can do hit tests based on a codeGeometrycode but that seems to be a manual hit test to find a certain control but not to filter actual hit tests.p  pDisabling and reenabling would be a lot of overhead since you would have to iterate through the whole codeVisualTreecode...p  pWhats the easiest method Id really like it if it was possible using a Geometry or similiar.p

I noticed that when I used a large enough image, the sampling would start to pixelate out and not maintaining the clarity of the source image. My best guess would be that this is an artifact of using the 32bit floats in the shader.p  pHere is my shader codep  precodesampler2D input  registerS0 float2 tl  registerC0  TopLeft UV Corner float2 br  registerC1  BottomLeft UV Corner  float4 mainfloat2 uv  TEXCOORD  COLOR       float2 diff  br  tl     float2 nuv  uv  diff  tl     nuv  nuv  floornuv  Use this to wrap the texture      return tex2Dinput, nuv  codepre  pAnd here is a snippet of the image I am trying to use the source images dimensions are 23043x816p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comYzxrc.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYzxrc.png altSource Image Snippetap  pAnd the same snippet as seen through the shaderp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comwsyjs.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwsyjs.png altImage Snippet postShaderap  pIs there something I could do to fix this, or should I be doing it differently Or maybe theres an existing shader that I could use for this exact purposep

Negative 378 pWe have a twoscreen DirectX application that previously ran at a consistent 60 FPS the monitors sync rate using a NVIDIA 8400GS 256MB. However, when we swapped out the card for one with 512 MB of RAM the frame rate struggles to get above 40 FPS. It only gets this high because were using triplebuffering. The two cards are from the same manufacturer PNY. All other things are equal, this is a Windows XP Embedded application and we started from a fresh image for each card. The driver version number is 169.21.p  pThe application is all 2D. I.E. just a bunch of textured quads and a whole lot of prerendered graphics hence the need to upgrade the cards memory. We also have compressed animations which the CPU decodes on the fly  this involves a texture lock. The locks take forever but Ive also tried having a separate system memory texture for the CPU to update and then updating the rendered texture using the devices UpdateTexture method. No overall difference in performance.p  pAlthough Ive read through every FAQ I can find on the internet about DirectX performance,  this is still the first time Ive worked on a DirectX project so any arcane bits of knowledge you have would be useful. p  pOne other thing whilst Im on the subject when calling Present on the swap chains it seems DirectX waits for the present to complete regardless of the fact that Im using D3DPRESENTDONOTWAIT in both present parameters PresentationInterval and the flags of the call itself. Because this is a twoscreen application this is a problem as the two monitors do not appear to be genlocked, Im working around it by running the Present calls through a threadpool.

Negative 378 pHey guys, ok, so, I have a jPlayer jQuery plugin playlist hidden on my home page httpwww.marioplanet.com.p  pNow, it is hidden by default and is only supposed to be activated upon clicking the image labeled Music in the upperrighthandcorner of my header codeltdivgtcode.p  pThis works great, and once an enduser clicks the image, a nice, slick slideToggle action occurs on the codeltdiv idplayergtcode element and it is revealed.p  pNow, everything holds.p  pUntil, the enduser clicks anywhere except the Music image again, the codeltdiv idplayergtcode element will slideToggle yet again, vanishing.p  pThe only problem, is when the enduser clicks upon the Music image again, because, as far as I know, it slideToggles twicep  pThat is definitely not what we want.p  pSo, here is the code which was adapted by Magnars helpful postp  precodetextmusic.clickfunction      jplayer.slideToggle500, function          body.clickfunction event              var outside  event.originalTarget.parentspopup.length  0             if outside                  jplayer.slideToggle500                 body.unbindclick                             codepre  pcodetextmusiccode is my image reading Music br  codejplayercode is my codeltdivgtcode containing my jPlayer pluginp  pSo, what I want to try and do is declare a variable, just like how codevar outsidecode is declared in the above code, which handles with the clicking of the codetextmusiccode image once the codejplayer ltdivgtcode is already visible.p  pHowever, I need a little assistance in understanding the meaning of this variable.p  pAnyone want to offer any words of wisdomp  p Thanksp

Negative 378 pAfter seeing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions217911whydontccompilersdefineoperatorandoperatorthis questiona, my first thought was that itd be trivial to define generic equivalence and relational operatorsp  precodeinclude ltcstringgt  templateltclass Tgt bool operatorconst Tamp a, const Tamp b       return stdmemcmpampa, ampb, sizeofT  0    templateltclass Tgt bool operatorltconst Tamp a, const Tamp b       return stdmemcmpampa, ampb, sizeofT lt 0   codepre  pcodeusing namespace stdrelopscode would then become even more useful, since it would be made fully generic by the default implementations of operators codecode and codeltcode. Obviously this does not perform a memberwise comparison, but instead a bitwise one, as though the type contains only POD members. This is not entirely consistent with how C generates copy constructors, for instance, which emdoem perform memberwise copying.p  pBut I wonder whether the above implementation is indeed safe. The structures would naturally have the same packing, being of the same type, but are the contents of the padding guaranteed to be identical e.g., filled with zeros Are there any reasons why or situations in which this wouldnt workp

Negative 378 pI want to convert my homegrown task queue system into a Celerybased task queue, but one feature I currently have is causing me some distress.p  pRight now, my task queue operates very coarsely I run the job which generates data and uploads it to another server, collect the logging using a variant on Noses log capture library, and then I store the logging for the task as a detailed result record in the application database.p  pI would like to break this down as three tasksp  ol licollect datali liupload datali lireport results including all logging from the preceding two tasksli ol  pThe real kicker here is the logging collection. Right now, using the log capture, I have a series of log records for each log call made during the data generation and upload process. These are required for diagnostic purposes.  Given that the tasks are not even guaranteed to run in the same process, its not clear how I would accomplish this in a Celery task queue.p  pMy ideal solution to this problem will be a trivial and ideally minimally invasive method of capturing all logging during the predecessor tasks 1, 2 and making it available to the reporter task 3p  pAm I best off remaining fairly coarsegrained with my task definition, and putting all of this work in one task or is there a way to pass the existing captured logging around in order to collect it at the endp

Negative 378 pMy .Net program uses a fortran Dll to perform a maths function Arpack, solves eigen modes.  I believe the fortran contains static varibles and generally isnt thread safe. Also its very complicated and would probably take a lot of hard work to make it thread safe.  The Dll isnt very large 700K so I just want to load it many times say 4, or maybe 8 to allow the threads to work concurrently.  Anyone have any idea how I can do this  I hear that LoadLibrary will always return the same handle when called multiple times.  So, as it stands my only solution is to have multiple copies of my Dll on disk Arpack1.dll, Arpack2.dll etc and load them as required.  Pretty horrible.p  pAny ideasp  pEuanp

Negative 378 pIm working on a small memory tool which tracks allocations and deallocations, object sizes, object types, and so on.  The method Im using to track source files, line numbers, and object types works like thisp  precodedefine DEBUGNEW SourcePacketFILE, LINE  new define new DEBUGNEW codepre  pSourcePacket is just a small class which takes a const char and an int during construction.  These values are populated via the codeFILEcode and codeLINEcode macros.  The object type is acquired like sop  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt T operatorconst SourcePacketamp packet, T p codepre  pp is the pointer to the newly allocated object, the type of which is discovered using RTTI.  In the operator overload, the information is taken and stored in the tracer and the pointer is passed on to the program.  Further info like the size and address is grabbed in the overloaded operator new.p  pNow, this setup has worked very well for me.  It doesnt work for code which I dont compile, naturally, but one of the best things is that it plays nice with placement new calls made by the user, which didnt work using the oftcitedp  precodedefine new newFILE, LINE codepre  pmethod.  The problem Ive encountered is that if the user calls operator new, the program simply cant compile.  Of course, this is because the macro expands like sop  precodereturn operator SourcePacketblahblah.cpp, 20  newsize codepre  pinstead ofp  precodereturn SourcePacketblahblah.cpp, 20  newsize codepre  pI cant really see any way around this.  I could, of course, just remove the SourcePacket  new procedure and just let my overloaded operator new collect the size and address, but that kind of defeats a large portion of the purpose of the tool.  p  pAlso, just as a note, Im not trying to create Valgrind or anything, and I know that overloading the global ops can be rather dodgy.  This is mostly for educational purposes.  In addition, I know that OSspecific features can be used to discover some of this information, but I would only like to use standard C in order for it to be crossplatform and bitindependent x86, x64, etc..  So far its worked flawlessly for me on both Linux and Windows releases of both bitflavors.p  pUnfortunately, there doesnt seem to be any way to conditionally use one way or the other, depending on if its just new or placement new or operator new.  Its not critical that I get this to work, but I would be interested to hear if anyone has found a way around this limitation.  p

Negative 378 pI recall reading about how exceptions could be caught without the use of trycatch. Basically when an exception is thrown such as Unhandled exception via derefencing a null pointer, there would be a process that is triggered even when a trycatch is not coded for the exception. I believe it had something to do with a top level library that you write then include in your code. Unfortunately documentation on such a method seems to be nonexistent but I have seenheard of such a method being done before. Could someone please explain how this is donep

Negative 378 pWhats the best way  or, indeed, any way  to calculate a running total in Rails p  pI have a model, Sale. It has a quantity column and a salesvalue column. I need to populate a third column, totalquantity, with the sum of the quantity values of the previous records, when the table is sorted by isbnid, then channelid, then invoicedate. This sets all sorts of sensible database management alarm bells ringing, so Im wondering if its even possible. p  pThe reason for needing this cumulative sum is to apply a percentage to the sales where the cumulative quantity is within a particular range. I cant use an average sales value across all records, because the margin on sales can vary dramatically over time  so Id apply an average to a bunch of sales which might over or under pay the royalty payee. p  pSo. Should I do a beforesave callback on the Sale model, and updateattribute, somehow Is there a method to return the value of the previous record when the table is sorted in a particular way Or should I dump all Sale records into an array and maybe use inject to accumulate the running total p  pAny ideas most welcome, thanks in advance. p  pUpdate subsequent question asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6145908updateattributeincallbackrails3herea. p

Negative 378 pI havent done much research on this yet, but im just asking around in case this has been done before.p  pHeres my problemp  pI have a set of cubes of an arbitrary height, width and depth. These are either filled or empty. What im looking to do is develop an algorithm that is going to create an optimal mesh for this set of cubes by combining the faces of neighboring cubes into one. p  pMy current idea is to step through the set 6 timestwice along each axis, once forwards and once back, and look at the set in cross section. Ignoring cubes that wont be visible from the outside, id like to build polygonal face for those cubes in that section. At the end of this, i should have xyz2 of these faces. Combining them should give me the resulting optimized mesh for the voxel set.p  pIm stumped on the triangulation process however.p

These files should instead be present with the contents they had on HEAD at the time of the branch commit.p  pIm not sure if it helps or not, but official builds made on any branch tag all of the files used in the build with a monotonically increasing build number that is, build123 is a tag that includes a bunch of files from HEAD, and build124 is a Release01 build that includes a mix of files from HEAD and the Release01 branch, and build125 is back to all HEAD files.p  pI am converting to git, but the issue should apply to any output repository. If there is a solution that only works when converting to svn, I can do a twostep conversion.p  pI see three possible ways to approach thisp  ol lisome combinations of options andor custom code for the cvs2svn step to fill each nonHEAD branch with the files that existed on HEAD at the time of the revisionli lisome sort of postprocessing of the cvs2svn output before the import into gitli liuse gitfilterbranch to rewrite the git history after the import into gitli ol  pAm I missing an easy solution Should I just accept the imperfect import and move on There is only one active branch other than HEAD right now, but it would be useful to have a full and accurate history to refer too.p

Negative 378 pThis question has been repeatedly asked and answered with oneline assertions, such as because it is an obvious violation of MVC.  Frankly, I just dont get it.  Indeed, it feels to me that putting session inside the controller merely an artifact that ApplicationController faces the network layer via a rack call, rather than an MVC mandate.  Let me explain my problem.p  pRolling an authentication from scratch, I found myself agonizing and spiking all over the place for lack of ability to articulate simple tests session isnt available to the testing framework either.  My authentication scheme, as almost all I have seen in rails, wanted to use the session hash as a persistence layer to retain the id for the User model of the current user.  Doesnt that feel FAR MORE like a model than a controller artifactp  pThe code smells are obvious whenever you look at the typical sessions controller this one from Ryan Bates excellent screencasts.  Desperate to shovel this concept in with rest, we see unhealthy language such asp  precodedef create    user  User.findbyemailparams[session][email]   if user ampamp user.authenticateparams[session][password]     session[userid]  user.id     redirectto rooturl, notice Logged in   else     flash.now.alert  Email or password is invalid     render new   end end codepre  pTo me, this is a code smell, an obviously overlogicked controller that is screaming for refactoring  But we cant.  Why  Oh yes, because it is a violation of MVC to put references to the session, used as a persistence lawyer into the model.  WTF  Doesnt it say something to you that we seem to want to CALL THIS REST RESOURCE sessionsp  pTo see why this is just plain screwy, look at your login views  handcoded html, or use of the tags API  If we had an ActiveModel model to do this code, then the create code could look like the usual scaffolding, or possibly even reduced to the respondwith oneliner.p  precodedef create    recognition  Recognition.newparams[user]   if recognition.save     redirectto rooturl, notice gt Thank you for signing up   else     render new   end end codepre  pThen, take a look at the handcoded html for all of those views  If Recognition was a model, persisted by session or some other means that should not be the responsibility of the controller layer anyway, then you could simple use form builder or simpleform to generate the forms.  Of course, we could simply pass the session hash to a newlogin class method of Recognition, say codeRecognition.onsession.newparams[recognition]code, but that seems uglier than it has to be.  Perhaps it is inherent, as we will want to use a currentuser reference later in the application layer, perhaps codeRecognition.onsession.currentusercode similar to the way one might use a singleton patternp  pJust try to build your authentication package with strict BDD, and honestly tell me you havent spiked this portion of it  If we had a Recognition model, this entire thing would be reduced to a simple set of unit tests without hackery.  Now, instead we have the sole use case for integration testing, magic invasions of ActiveController modules and hacks to make speedy any acceptance testing of the loggedinas predicate.p  pI think the entire point of ActiveModel was to facilitate this kind of rethinking and refactoring.  Not all models use the database.  Why not persist to the session  p  pI have been using devise and its kin for too long, burying these smells with the dont mess with the gem excuse I dont have to look at them.  No longer  I think I am going to reject the zealots from now on.  Sorry, to me, session is a persistence layer that should be manipulated in the Model layer of MVC.  I posit, but am not sure, that the reason it lives in controllerland has more to do with the ugly or elegant fact that controllers are rack objects than any theoretical MVC magic.p  pSo once again, is there a more elegant way to access the session layer than to have logic in the controller for thatp

Negative 378 pThis is probably a long shot but I asked a question about converting one of the statistics toolbox codes earlyier into C realising that it was just a huge and lengthy process and there was not much in the way to automate it emreally what I wanted as the references I provided explained why it was so hard to do by hand, as the comments I got where why dont you try convert it and ask questions on where you are stuck, which obviously my question wasnt understoodem. p  pThe reason I was looking to do this is because of the long processing time required by matlab to complete what im working on kmeans and bayes classifiers on large data sets. So I thought well hey why not just convert the code into C and try my hand at multithreading and Multiprocessing, this might provide a functional means to decrease the processing time. But obviously its extremely hard to convert all of matlabs functions to C by hand to accommandate this. p  pSo my question is if I import matlabs files into C is it possible to have them usedran in multithreading and multiprocessing fashion or will the imported files just run like they do in matlabp  pThe reason I think it runs slow in matlab is that the functions or some of them in the statistics toolbox only benefit from multithreading specificallyp  precodeMATHEMATICS Arrays and matrices  Basic information ISFINITE, ISINF, ISNAN, MAX, MIN  Operators , , ., ., ., ., , ,  MLDIVIDE,  MRDIVIDE  Array operations PROD, SUM  Array manipulation BSXFUN, SORT   Linear algebra  Matrix Analysis DET, RCOND  Linear Equations CHOL, INV, LINSOLVE, LU, QR  Eigenvalues and singular values EIG, HESS, SCHUR, SVD, QZ  Elementary math  Trigonometric ACOS, ACOSD, ACOSH, ASIN, ASIND, ASINH, ATAN, ATAND, ATANH, COS, COSD, COSH,HYPOT, SIN, SIND, SINH, TAN, TAND, TANH  Exponential EXP, POW2, SQRT  Complex ABS  Rounding and remainder CEIL, FIX, FLOOR, MOD, REM, ROUND  Special Functions  ERF, ERFC, ERFCINV, ERFCX, ERFINV, GAMMA, GAMMALN  DATA ANALYSIS  CONV2, FILTER, FFT and IFFT of multiple columns or long vectors, FFTN, IFFTN   codepre  pSo im not to sure how or in what way I could potentially decrease the processing time, the kmeans and bayes classifier when processeing near tens of thousands of records really is just unbearable on its processing time understandable. p

Negative 378 pIm completely new to Windows Phone and the Windows galaxy in general as far as programming goes. For a project of a phone app that has to run on a windows phone, I started exploring the resources and I have some questions.p  pOne of the problems I encountered is that things change very quickly. For example, answers to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4209497windowsphone7andhtml5this questiona say that browsers in Windows Phone will most likely not support HTML5. However, there are many online tutorials for instance a hrefhttpwww.asp.netmvctutorialsmvc4aspnetmvc4mobilefeatures relnofollowherea introducing ASP.NET MVC 4 and how it is appropriate for mobile apps. p  pI would personally like to go the HTML5javascript way instead of learning how to develop with Silverlight, which apparently has been discontinued by Microsoft. However, my first concern is evidently to be able to create an application that works p  pSo with that in mind, my questions are the followingp  ul liMy impression is that HTML5JS is being introduced in replacement of Silverlight and will be more used in the future. Is that correctli liKnowing that I have to build an app which should be able to play videos and audio, record audio, and connect to a library to do some speech processing in the background, should I use Silverlight or can I try using ASP.NET MVC 4 From what I gather, Silverlight would be better than XNAli liAre there limitations to using HTML5JS as compared to Silverlight or the other way around li liCan you package a web app i.e. using HTML5JS to be used locally on the phone if there is no access to a distant serverli ul  pAny specific pointers or answers on these specific issues will be more than welcome p

Negative 378 pIs there a programming language or package that supports table based reactive declarative programming in memory very similar to the SQL language and trigger facilityp  pFor example, I could define PERSON and JOB tables as functionsp  precodename PERSON gt STRING female PERSON gt BOOLEAN mother PERSON gt PEOPLE father PERSON gt PEOPLE  title JOB gt STRING company JOB gt STRING salary JOB gt INTEGER empoyee JOB gt PERSON codepre  pThen I would like to calculate functions likep  precodechildcount PERSON gt INTEGER childcountP   Q in PERSON  fatherQ  P or matherQ  P   income PERSON gt INTEGER incomeP  SUM  salaryJ  J in JOB and empoyeeJ  P   incomeperchild PERSON gt INTEGER incomeperchildP  incomeP  childcountP  parent PERSON x PERSON gt BOOLEAN personP,Q  P  fatherQ or P  motherQ  error PERSON gt BOOLEAN errorP  femaleP and exists Q in PERSONfatherQ  P    or not femaleP and exists Q in PERSONmotherQ  P    or exists Q in PERSONparentP,Q and errorQ codepre  pSo essentially I would like to have calculated columns in tables that are automatically updated whenever values in the tables change. Similar things could be expressed with SQL triggers, but I would like to have such functionality built into a language and executed in memory. The propagation of changes need to be optimized. Are there frameworks to do this p  pThe observer patter and reactive programming focuses on individual objects. But I do not want to maintain pointers and extra structure for each row in my tables as there could be million of rows. All the rules are generic although they can refer to different rows via parentchildren relations, etc, so some form of recursion is required.p

Negative 378 pMy goal to compare the filenames in a directory with the names in a spreadsheet. If there is a match, then I wish to append the corresponding account number of that name to the filename.p  pI have used the dir command to retrieve all of the filenames in a directory, then pasted the list into a column in the Excel spreadsheet.p  pI now have 4 columns Account number, LastName, FirstName, and filename. The main problem here is that the filenames are inconsistent. Theyre in the form of lastname, firstname date, but they vary in the forms of Smith, John 010112, Smith, J. 010112, Smith J 010112. This means that when it comes to the first name, Ill only be comparing the first letter of the string.p  pSo essentially, for each filename I need to check the lastname against the lastname column. If a match is found, then I need to check the first letter of the filenames firstname against the first letter of the firstname in the same row as the matching lastname. If this is also a match, then I need to grab the account number in that row and append it to the filename. p  pHow could I do this Im pretty new to Excel functions, but I do have a little experience with coding in Java and C from some college classes.p

Negative 378 pIn my sweet app you can use two kinds of items from a list of items. There are equipable items, and bag items. When you navigate to the inventory screen, there are two sections of a table view, each with 4 cells. Four cells for equipped items, and four cells for items in your bag. If you dont have anything equipped, the cells just say empty.p  pHow can I populate table cells conditionally based on the shape of my results objectp  pHere is the code I wish I hadp  precode UITableViewCelltableViewUITableViewtableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPathindexPath     static NSString CellIdentifier  Cell    UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier]    if cell  nil      cell  [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifierCellIdentifier] autorelease]        this returns nil if the index path was out of bounds   NSManagedObject  item  [self.fetchedResultsController carefullyGetObjectAtIndexPathindexPath]    if nil  item      cell.textLabel.text  empty      else      cell.textLabel.text  [item valueForKeyname]        codepre  pSome problems Ive encountered trying to implement this careful objectAtIndexPathp  pI tried bounds checking, but Im having trouble because the fetchedArray is flat, while the  conceptual model I am trying to navigate is not flat rows are in sections. p  pI tried using a trycatch, but then I remembered that the outofbounds elements are undefined, not nil... so sometimes I get an error that I can catch and react to, and sometimes I just get random interesting stuff. The setup I have nowp  precodetry     NSManagedObject managedObject  [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPathindexPath]    return managedObject  catch NSException  e    return nil  codepre  pconsistently gives me 5 entries, 4 in the right places and 1 oddball which is a repeat from the other section.p  pNot sure how to navigate the fetched results manually. Im playing with four items, 2 of each kind. I had hoped it would be as easy as a doubly nested array, with sections on the outside and rows on the in. It seems that things are trickier than this. When I inspect the fetchedResults NSArray, I see that it is flat. All the bag items are first, and the equipable come next. I dont imagine I can depend on this ordering, though, so I dont feel safe making a mapping function to go from indexPath section to array index. I could be convinced to feel safe about this.p  pAn alternative I thought of involves populating my inventory with 8 empty items that would be returned as place holder results when the sections dont get completely filled. This doesnt sit well with me though.p  pI realize why this isnt working tables arent supposed to have empty rows. But I want my table to have empty rowsp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pHeres the method Im using for now...p  precode NSManagedObject carefullyGetObjectAtIndexPathNSIndexPathindexPath     NSLogin  s, [self class], cmd    NSString  desiredType  indexPath.section  BAGSECTION bag  equipable   NSArray  fetchedObjects  [self.fetchedResultsController fetchedObjects]   NSInteger sectionStartIndex  1     iterate until you hit a type you like   NSUInteger i, count  [fetchedObjects count]   for i  0 i lt count i      NSObject  obj  [fetchedObjects objectAtIndexi]     NSString  fetchedType  NSString[obj valueForKeytype]      if [desiredType isEqualToStringfetchedType]        sectionStartIndex  i       break            if 1  sectionStartIndex       maybe there arent any of that type of item     else       NSInteger calculatedEntityIndex  sectionStartIndex  indexPath.row     NSLogcalculated index d, calculatedEntityIndex       if we are still in the array     if calculatedEntityIndex lt [fetchedObjects count]          then we can get the object       NSManagedObject  entity  [fetchedObjects objectAtIndexcalculatedEntityIndex]         and if we are still in the right section       NSString  typeForEntityAtIndex  [entity valueForKeytype]        if [desiredType isEqualToStringtypeForEntityAtIndex]           then this is what we wanted          return entity                   return nil     codepre  pI just really dont feel I should have to iterate over something like this...p  pz.p  pFull disclosure this is a term project, but the project is to make the app by any means necessary.

Negative 378 pI am sure everyone who programmed with user controls for asp.net came across situations where you needed a certain way to check whether a user control has been loaded for the first time or it has been reloaded. Has anyone come up with any other solutions other than setting hidden currentOpenControl flags. If you are wondering as to do I need to check whether control is open for first time or reopen again, then one of the big reasons is databinding. When the control is open for first time, that is when I want to databind, afterwards on reopen, if I databind again I will lose any changes user might have added.   So I am just wondering if anyone has a more elegant solution than setting flags whether control is open or not.p  pThanks p

Negative 378 pI know this question has been asked several times before, but I upon reading many answers, I havent found something which suits me. First, please look at the following code, which is supposed to open an AlertDialog once an image is clicked this works perfectly. The AlertDialog hosts an EditText field  this is where the problem arisesp  precode    ImageView scissorsImage  ImageView findViewByIdR.id.scissorsImage     scissorsImage.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener          public void onClickView view                       AlertDialog.Builder alert  new AlertDialog.Buildercontext              alert.setTitleApply a Coupon             alert.setMessageEnter the coupon amount i.e. 25 for 25               Set an EditText view to get user input              final EditText couponAmount  new EditTextcontext             alert.setViewcouponAmount              couponAmount.setTextcouponAmountString              alert.setPositiveButtonOk, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener                  public void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int whichButton                      String couponAmountString  couponAmount.getText.toString                     System.out.printlncouponAmountString                                            alert.setNegativeButtonCancel, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener                  public void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int whichButton                       Canceled.                                            alert.show                codepre  pNow, this bit of code is inside my codeonCreatecode method, and the variable codecouponAmountStringcode is outside the codeonCreatecode method. So the code executes just fine, the only problem is that the line codecouponAmount.setTextcouponAmountStringcode does not work as I want it to.p  pWhat I am trying to do with it is that when the user puts a value in the dialog box, and closes it by pressing OK, the value gets stored in codecouponAmountStringcode  so far so good. When the user touches the image again to reopen the dialog box, I am emtryingem to have the EditText field preset with the last value they entered, hence codecouponAmount.setTextcouponAmountStringcode. But this isnt working, because I have to declare the EditText field as codefinalcode. Which is why I get the error codeCannot refer to a nonfinal variable inside an inner class defined in a different methodcode when I click on the image the second time.p  pSo is there any way I can accomplish what I wantp  pThanksp

Negative 378 pI noticed some weired behaviour under 10.7.3 and higher also under 10.8.p  pMy app is a little helper app that has an NSStatusItem and a dock icon by default. The user can configure, if he wants to display only the StatusItem, the Dock icon or both. To reailze this I am having codeLSUIElementYEScode in the Info.plist. If the user has configured the DockIcon to be displayed I am doingp  pcodeTransformProcessTypeamp ProcessSerialNumber 0, kCurrentProcess , kProcessTransformToForegroundApplicationcode p  pin applicationDidFinishLaunching.p  pThis worked fine until 10.7.3. Starting with 10.7.3 the dock icon is sometimes displayed two times though only one instance of the app is running. In this case the app can be terminated normally, but the second icon remains unresponsive in the dock. Restarting the dock makes the icon dissappear. This mainly happens, if the app is an LoginItem and automatically started on login. Executing codeTransformProcessTypeamp ProcessSerialNumber 0, kCurrentProcess , kProcessTransformToForegroundApplicationcode  with a delay of 1 second or more seems to solve the issue. Its however not a good approach as the user gets no instant feedback, that the application has been started.p  pDoes anyone know anything about this issue and a possible workaroundsolution Some googling revealed that Growl seems to have this issue starting in 10.7.3 as well, but not any solution. Note Setting codeLSUIElementNOcode and using codekProcessTransformToUIElementApplicationcode, if the user has chosen not to display the dockicon does not work for me as the app needs to be compatible with 10.5 and 10.6.p

Negative 378 pI have a SQL Server database set up as the publisher in a replication environment. It has a couple of subscriptions and several different people have been executing codeINSERTcode statements on these. Because of the different value ranges allocated for identity columns, we end up with very wide variations once all the data is pushed back up into the publication. p  pThis is of course to be expected and even desirable in a production environment. However, were still in development and therefore desire to reorganize all identity values so they are sequential. Instead of code[1,2,3,1001,1001,1003]code wed like to have code[1,2,3,4,5,6]code. I realize this means changing the identity column values and to update them accordingly across the relationships they support. Is it possible to do something like this p

Negative 378 pConsider following example. Lets say we have an app in which professional writers write stories from a web based UI. And then these stories become available for user of the iOS app as in app purchase items.p  pAs you may know we need to create in app purchase products in advance. But in our situations it means that for each of the story created by the writers we will have to create a new IAP product and wait for Apple to approve it.p  pTo circumvent this, I am planning to create generic consumable products in IAP like story worth 1.99, story worth 2.99, so on, so forth. Then in the Application UI I will show the list of stories of created by the writers and show corresponding prices for the stories as specified by the authors when they created the story. Once the user taps on the buy button, I will show the purchase for the generic consumable product of the same price and complete the in app purchase process. p  pNow the question is will Apple approve of such implementation Does it fit with their IAP policy I am asking as I couldnt find a guideline for a workflow such as this. p  pAnother approach to implement this is by implementing an in app creditcurrency system, like games use. Where people buy creditscoins and then they purchase items with coins. This is a tried and tested approach but it doesnt fit in my analogy of the app, hence the question.p

Negative 378 pWe have a solution called, say, codeCabbagecode thats split up into a WCFbased backend codeCabbage.Backendcode, and a frontend codeCabbage.Frontendcode. A problem that crops up somewhat often is that a developer changes the definition of a WCF service in codeCabbage.Backendcode, then updates the service reference in codeCabbage.Frontendcode strongwithoutstrong first rebuilding codeCabbage.Backendcode. The services are meant to be tightly coupled this way, the layers are only separated by WCF to let us deploy backend hotfixes quicker. This regenerates the service client based on a random old build instead of the current state of the source code, the BE dev calls it a day, hilarious merge conflicts occur when the FE dev updates the client himself.p  pIs there any way to make Visual Studio automatically rebuild the service project  the whole solution before every run of Update Service Reference to avoid thisp

I found myself pondering how to best provide dependencies to objects that need them in Ruby.p  pAt first thought, I did not actually think DI and IoC frameworks would be required to interact with dependencies because of the leniency of dynamic languages a la redefinition, mixins, stubs, etc. Then, however, I came across answers as to why DIIoC frameworks are strongnot neededstrong in dynamic languages. The reasons provided dont sit too well with me. Im hoping I can see an example that might clear things up.p  h2Recommended suggestions that I kind of disagree withh2  h3Reason 1 A dependent class can be changed at run time think testingh3  pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2273683whyareioccontainersunnecessarywithdynamiclanguages23084942308494Why are IOC containers unnecessary with dynamic languagesa we see that a dependent class noninjected, say codeXcode, can be stubbed or mocked in a test. Sure, but that requires us to know our codeSystem Under Testcode is depending on something called codeXcode. If our codeSystem Under Testcode suddenly depends on codeNcode instead of codeXcode, we must now remember to mock codeNcode instead of codeXcode. The benefit of using DI is wed never accidentally run a test with production dependencies because wed always be passing in mocked dependencies.p  h3Reason 2 Subclass or use constructor injection for testingh3  pIn everyones favorite goto resource for all things DI  Ruby, a hrefhttpweblog.jamisbuck.org2008119legosplaydohandprogrammingLEGOs, PlayDoh, and Programminga, we see an example of subclassing a System Under Test to mock dependencies. Alternatively, we can use constructor injection. Okay, so codeBcode depends on codeAcode. We call codeB.getdependencycode which provides codeBcode with an instance of codeAcode. But what if codeAcode depends on codeNcode which depends on codeXcode Must we call codegetdependencycode on each successive object in the chainp  h3Reason 3 Dependencies can be mixed in or monkeypatchedh3  pa hrefhttpfabiokung.com20100506rubyanddependencyinjectioninadynamicworldFabio mentionsa we can just use mixinsmonkeypatch. So codeXcode is mixedin to codeNcode. But The issue is what if codeXcode depends on codeAcode which depends on codeBcode Do we just use mixins for every dependency down the chain I see how that can work but it could get messy and confusing quickly.p  hr  pSide note a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comsearchqdependency20injection20dynamic20languageMany users saya DI frameworks are not needed in dynamic languages. However, Angular.JS has really benefited from implementing a pretty solid DI system. Angular is built on JavaScript, a dynamic language. Is this approach comparable to Ruby or Pythonp  pPlease keep in mind Im not saying I want to emforceem DIIoC into Ruby, Python, etc.p
Negative 378 pstrongScenariostrongbr  The DB for an application has gone down. This results in any actor responsible for committing important data to the DB failing to get a connectionp  pstrongPreferred Behaviourstrongbr  The important data is written to the db when it comes back up emsometime in the futureem.p  pstrongCurrent Implementationstrongbr  The actor catches the DBException, wraps the data in a DBWriteFailed case class, and sends the message to its supervisor. The supervisor then schedules another write for sometime in the future e.g. 1 minute using system.scheduler.scheduleOnce... so that we dont spin in circles too much while waiting for the DB to come back up.p  pThis implementation certainly works but I feel there might be a better way.p  ul liThe protocol gets a bit messier when the committing actor has to respond to the original sender after a successful commit.li liThe regular flow of messages to the committing actor is not throttled in any way and the actor will happily process the new messages, likely failing to connect to the DB for each and every one of them.li liIf messages get caught in this retry loop for too long, the mailboxes of the committing actors will start to balloon. It is important that this data be committed, but none of it matters if the application crawls to a halt or crashes due to excessive memory usage.li ul  pI am an akka novice and I am largely inexperienced when it comes to supervisor strategies, but I feel as though I may be able to leverage one of those to handle some of this retry logic.p  pIs there a common approach in akka for solving a problem like this Am I on the right track or should I be heading in a different directionp  pAny help is appreciated.p

What I really want is the Type to prefer NOT NULL, while the Date should be MAX...but I want them to always be from the same row with the Type value being NOT NULL taking precedence.p  pSo my results should be something likep  precode1       NULL      2222        both Types are null, so last date chosen 2       A         2222        one Type not null, so that date chosen 3       B         2222        both Types not null, so last date chosen 4       A         1111        one Type not null, so that date chosen and it is not the most recent date codepre  pIf I do a MAX on Date, thats not right.  If I do a COALESCE on Type, Ill get a nonnull value over a NULL...but not necessarily the most recent one.p  pIs there a clean way to do this  I think I see how I can do this with a series selects, a table variable, and a UNION, which is how I am going to try to move forward, but if theres a clean SQL solution that someone could just even make a nod at, that would be welcome.p  pIm in SQL Server, but Im guessing that if theres a clean SQL way to do it, it will probably be fairly DB agnostic.p

Negative 378 pI statically compiled and linked a program in an uptodate Linux machine, and ran it in another Linux which is 9 years old. It gave me an error FATAL kernel too old and quit. Specifically, the new one is Fedora 18 gcc 4.7.2, glibc 2.16, kernel 3.7.2 and the old one is RHEL4.8 glibc 2.3.4, kernel 2.6.9. Since its static linking, glibc version shouldnt matter. I guess the problem here is that the program calls system calls thats not in the old kernel.p  pIf development on the old system is not an option, how can I build the program in the new system and run in the older or even better, both I was looking for a way to run gcc in a compatible mode, which only calls old system calls.

Negative 378 pWe use one of the older versions of apache axis2 for our web services framework.

Ive got the authentication verification mechanism working fine inc. password callbacks, etc. p  pThe issue Im having concerns getting rampart to recognise a replay attack, basically the functionality of the rampart module associated with recognising these seems to be inactive. I can send the same security header to my axis2 service any number of times even sending a security header I generated yesterday and it authenticates fine and completes the webservice request.p  pMy best guess is  Im missing a config setting somewhere for the rampart module that enables the functionality to detect replay attacks. Ive tried both the config suggestions given in the links below in the services.xml file and neither seem to work p  ul lia hrefhttphasinigunasinghe.blogspot.com.au20120201archive.html relnofollowhttphasinigunasinghe.blogspot.com.au20120201archive.htmla li lia hrefhttpaxis.apache.orgaxis2crampartdocsconfigurations.html relnofollowhttpaxis.apache.orgaxis2crampartdocsconfigurations.htmla right at the bottom, it mentions Replay attacksli ul  pAnyone able to help or give me some idea what Im missing and where Id imagine its config setting related p  pIve got the module declaration for rampart in my axis2.xml file  codeltmodule reframpartgtcodep  pAnd I have what I believe to be the rampart config settings in my services.xml file after all my operations are declared p  precodeltparameter nameInflowSecuritygt       ltactiongt         ltitemsgtUsernameToken Timestampltitemsgt         ltpasswordCallbackClassgtcom.myCompany.service.dummy.MyAuthenticatorltpasswordCallbackClassgt       ltactiongt     ltparametergt      ltrampartrampartconfig xmlnsramparthttpws.apache.orgrampartpolicygt             ltramparttimestampprecisioninmillisecondsgttrue             ltramparttimestampprecisioninmillisecondsgt             ltramparttimestampttlgt300ltramparttimestampttlgt             ltramparttimestampmaxskewgt300ltramparttimestampmaxskewgt             ltramparttimestampstrictgtfalseltramparttimestampstrictgt             ltrampartReplayDetectiongt1000ltrampartReplayDetectiongt     ltrampartrampartconfiggt   codepre

For instance Currency calculations may return decimals, counters would probably return integers or longs etc.p  pI have a calculation repository that loads itself up on application load and when there comes a time that a formula must be evaluated, the calculation engine takes the object that is being queried against  in this example, if we have some concrete instance of type codeIClientAccountcode and we wish to evaluate some formula against it  for instance, levy 1.20 for each invoice after the first 5 codeMath.MaxBillableInvoiceCount  5, 0  1.20code. The engine goes and grabs all calculations where TIn is of type IClientAccount and matches the calculation with the token found in the formula i.e. codeBillableInvoiceCountcode. Then some calculation engine such as NCalc, FLEE or another calculation engine would evaluate the final equation.p  pSo, my problem is that I dont wish to iterate through emeveryem calculation looking for the correct token  and realistically, tokens could collide if they spanned multiple object types. For instance I may want to use the same token to mean different things in different contexts. It would be easier if I could narrow the calculations in my repository to just those where TIn matches the object type Im trying to calculate against.p  pI have a few trains of thought at this point  p  p1. Can I create a repository that marshals only the TIn part of my object I think the answer to this is likely, no... but on the chance of it being possible, I dont have the first clue how to implement this  does anyone have any ideasp  p2. Is there a way to query my repository for all calculations where TIn matches the type of the object Im querying against If so, howp  p3. Do I have multiple repositories based on all the combinations of TInTOut that I have calculations for... and if so, how do I go about marrying up the correct repositories with the object Im querying against Because Im still trying to match up a repository based on only the TIn portion...p  p4. Make all my calculations return doubles instead of allowing them to return different types, then my repositories can be typed to just the input type making them simpler... but while this is simple, semantically, it just feels wrong.p  pThoughtsp  pCheers in advance p

Negative 378 pI wrote a php script that basically fetches RSS feeds and stores them in a database.

Negative 378 pI am planning a large project that is going to use Neo4j as main storage to model the data, but I was wondering if I should additionally use something like MySQL as a parallel structure to back the user administration subsystem. It would have the advantage that I could use something with which I have much more experience 18 Years to do the very tedious job of login and account administration. The disadvantage would be the overhead of keeping two databases in sync, since I do plan to have the users also represented as nodes in Neo4j with a small subset of the user information. I know that it depends a lot on the details of the project, but if anybody has experience in the field with a similar set up it would be very appreciated.p

After jpegstartdecompress we have the correct scaled      output image dimensions available, as well as the output colormap      if we asked for color quantization.

Step 8 Release JPEG decompression object        This is an important step since it will release a good deal of memory.      jpegdestroydecompressampcinfo       At this point you may want to check to see whether any corruptdata      warnings occurred test whether jerr.pub.numwarnings is nonzero.

While working on a purge job to drop a day of partitioning, our DBA has informed us that we will have to drop all foreign keys to any table, before performing the purge. This seems  like an unnecessary step, and thus, I am turning to the wisdom of stackoverflow.p  precode parentTable     childTable  ID   PK       ID   PKFK  date PK       date PKFK                  otherKeyPK   parentTable             childTable  ID     date         ID    date    otherKey    1       1023        1     1023     a  2       1023        2     1023     a  3       1023        3     1023     a  1       1024        1     1024     a  2       1024        2     1024     a                       2     1024     b codepre  pThe question is, if we were to drop the 1023 partition from childTable first, then parentTable, would we have to dropdisable the Foreign Key constraint before the purge, and create it again afterwards Is there a data situation where this would have to occur maybe not as shown in my example above.p

Negative 378 pI have setup a CentOS 6.4 server minimal install which is connected to network through an ethernet cable. The problem is that when the network link goes down, the status changes are not automatically detected but if i type ifconfig the interface still keeps its IP address which is assigned by a DHCP server. After some time that the link is down the interface loses the address but when the link comes up again the network connection is not automatically restored like it would happen in a desktop computer. Even the command dhclient eth0 does not always work to restore things, and I have to restart the whole network service with ectinit.dnetwork restart.p  pIs there any way to automatically detect network status changes like it happens in desktop installations Im thinking about a cron script that every 5 minutes pings a server outside my network and if it doesnt get any response it restarts network service, but this does not sound very efficient... is there another wayp  pEDIT I realized I have not explained the situation correctly. My network topology is server  switch  router  external network the router is another centos server with DHCPD. For some reasons that im not getting, when it happens that the router goes down and reboots, the other server becomes unreachable, and I have to manually restart network service on it. So the link does not effectively go down the switch keeps it up, but the status change is at IP level.p
Negative 378 pThere is the JSF validation framework  the JSF Validators and the validation phase, in which they run. So far my intuition was, they are designed mostly for simple, local, independent checks  regex test, number validation, etc.p  pBut then comes the question  how should the the complex validation scenarios be realized By emcomplexem I mean some longrunning checks with possibly heavy backend calls DB, WS and sideeffects involved. By emhowem I mean do they also fit into the validation framework p  pWhat I have seen so far, is that people rather lean towards here into eminvoke applicationem phase and custom error handling. And here comes the ugly part  custom error handling, so either coupling into JSF API invalidating components, setting messages or rendering everything by hand independent of hmessages  i.e. struggling hard only to mimic the already existing solution.p  pSo the question is less about technical feasibility defining validators and more about bestpractices.p  pThx, Jarekp

Negative 378 pOur group frequently has situations where we need to join our tables against identifiers that come from outside of the database, e.g. downloading data with matching associations found in a public data repository.p  pI know of basic two approaches. The one we most commonly use involves batching IN clauses. We have a utility for transparently wrapping long IN statements in separate queries when we are joining against 1000 items.p  pWith 5 items and batch limit of 4 the query p  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeSELECT foo.id, foo.data FROM foo WHERE foo.id IN MANY codepre  pbecomesp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeSELECT foo.id, foo.data FROM foo WHERE foo.id IN ,,, SELECT foo.id, foo.data FROM foo WHERE foo.id IN  codepre  pThis method works but seems quite kludgy. p  pThe alternative sometimes employed involves creating temporary tables, inserting the values, and joining against the normal tables.  This solution seems a bit more standard with respect to the final query as youre simply joining as you would if the data were in your database.  However, the temporary table creation doesnt seem to be something that can done in an ANSI SQL compliant way.p  pPerformance seems to be about equal with the IN method winning favor with few external values as expected.p  pWhat is the best practice for solving this problem in an ANSI standard wayp  pEdit With respect to performance measures, we were benchmarking the application code. This included the overhead of inserting into the temp tables. Likewise, for the IN clauses it included the overhead of batching them. p

Negative 378 pThe last time I did any serious programming was 25 years ago in C with a copy of Kernighan and Ritchie. Please be gentle with an aging amateurp  pIn essence, its the old nullable date picker thing. I have a solution working perfectly well with one exception. I am using a combination of a masked TextBox and a MonthCalendar. The masked TextBox simply displays any value including null from a data set and accepts values from the calendar. Pressing backspace in the calendar clears the masked TextBox. All This is very straightforward. All I need to do now is to hide the calendar when it loses focus. A simple example demonstrates the problem I havep  pCreate a form with a text box to take the initial focus, a masked text box and a hidden MonthCalendar. In the Enter event of the masked text box, I have the following codep  precodemonthCalendar1.Visible  true monthCalendar1.Focus codepre  pMy intention was to put the following code into the Leave event of the MonthCalendarp  precodemonthCalendar1.Visible  false codepre  pFor some reason, this code is triggered as soon as the calendar gets the focus and the calendar is hidden again immediately. Debugging confirms that this code is triggered. If the Leave event is empty, the MonthCalendar does indeed get the focus and retains it, because it is possible to navigate the calendar with the arrow keys.p  pCan anyone explain this behavior to an old fogey or, even better, give me a pointer to what Im trying to do.p  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 378 pIm trying to implement a private chat functionality, using sails.js framework, and im having some troubles when trying so send a message to a particular user.p  pCurrently, Ive achieved private communication by sending the messages to a particular socket.id, using the socket.ios code.socketsocket.id.emitevent,messagecode, but the problem with that approach is that every time the user opens a new tab, a new socket.id is generated, for that new connection.p  pAnd my question is does sails.js facilitates a way of emitting events using socket.io to an specific user emsessionem instead of a bunch of socket ids is it possible with these technologiesp  pSo I can send the event only once, and making sure it is received in all the tabs where the chat app is currently open.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 378 pI am currently studying computer science, and one of my required courses covers computer organization and architecture  or, in other words, an introduction to assembly language. This particular course uses the SPARC language, because the department machines are only compatible with SPARC or so Ive heard.p  pI have heard a little about assembly languages, and I know that there are different types like x86, ARM, and MIPS. My question is what type of assembly language is SPARC Or is SPARC its own type of assembly language What makes SPARC different from, say, the assembly language I might use on my desktop computer at home that runs Windows with an Intel processor Finally, just because I am curious, is it valuable to know SPARC by itself, or should I perhaps look into learning other assembly languages after I understand the basicsp

Negative 378 pIn The D Programming Language by Andrei Alexandrescu,p  ptheres an example where a delegate is taken as a template parameterp  precodeT[] findalias pred, TT[] input   ifistypeofpredinput[0]  bool    for input.length gt 0 input  input[1 .. ]      if predinput[0] break      return input   unittest    int[] a  [1,2,3,4,5,3,4]   int z  2   auto b  finddelegatex  return x lt z a   asssertb  a[4..]  codepre  pAlexandrescu explains that this works because a delegate is actually a fat pointer consisting of two parts the function pointer and the pointer to its stack frame which is why z is accessible inside its body.  Except that find takes pred as a TEMPLATE parameter, not as an argument.  And template arguments can only be compiletime constants.p  pIm sure the address of the anonymous delegate in our unit test is indeed a compiletime constant, but the address of its stackframe certainly shouldnt be, so how can the delegate be taken as a template parameterp  pWhats really going on herep

Negative 378 pIm new to Pandas, and Im trying to import financial time series from various csv sources into Pandas. However all of the csvs have different headers, which means I currently need to build custom logic to deal with each one. Im wondering if there might be a library or other utility available to get them into a standardized format. p  pFor example, a time series from one vendor might use codeTrade Datecode vs another that uses codeDatecode or codeTradeDatecode. Also, the date format within this column varies between sources, so I need to handle that. Similarly, codeOpencode, codeOpenPxcode, and codeOpen Pricecode are all the same thing. p  pFinally, some csvs have nonuseful text in the first or last line such as codeThis data is the property of ...code, that Id like to automatically remove.p  pCurrently Im using codedf  pandas.readcsvcode to read in the nonstandardized data, and then clunky code to remove the unnecessary top text and change header names into a single standardized set. Id like something more graceful  easier to maintain, if it exists.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 378 pWe have a production website with a mixture of classic ASP, inline .Net and compiled .Net that talks to a SQL Server instance where both are VMs on the same physical box and everything there works great. In order to do some testing with new features I created a QA version of the site and have it setup to connect to a database on a VM hosted on another physical server. They are different networks DMZinternal, but all in the same rack on gigabit so connection speeds shouldnt be an issue.p  pThe problem were running into is the QA version will work for a bit and then suddenly dies until I restart the app pool and the site. Its not a load issue because its just me and two other people testing this process and Ive confirmed the server where the QA database is at doesnt have a resource issue 16GB RAM, 3.2GB in use and processor utilization hovers in the 2 range. The specific error shown below occurs with all variants of the pages  classic ASP, inline .Net and the compiled .Net pages. Based on all the research Ive done, I keep getting pointed back to it being a firewall issue, but we even opened all ports between the two servers and it still happens. The strangest part is when we enable tracing on our ASA 5515X, it sees hardly any traffic and sometimes the site kicks back that error immediately while other times it takes 30 seconds. The pages in question arent doing any intense lookups one page that dies is grabbing a total of about 60 records as well.

The assembly itself builds just fine and VS2013 has no complaints about the reference itself.p  pHeres how the SQL CLR SP looks please dont ask me what on Earth that semicolon is doing there at the endp  precodeusing System using System.Data using System.Data.SqlClient using System.Data.SqlTypes using Microsoft.SqlServer.Server using System.IO using System.Text   public partial class StoredProcedures      [Microsoft.SqlServer.Server.SqlProcedure]     public static int SQLCLR1         SqlString in1,         SqlString in2,         SqlString in3,         SqlString in4,         SqlString in5                        ... code elided ...        codepre  pAnd the SQL sidep  precodeCREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[SQLCLR1]     in1 [nvarchar]4000,     in2 [nvarchar]4000,     in3 [nvarchar]4000,     in4 [nvarchar]4000,     in5 [nvarchar]4000 WITH EXECUTE AS CALLER AS EXTERNAL NAME [External].[StoredProcedures].[SQLCLR1] GO codepre  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma10691887486504An answer by AaronLSa gives the format of the codeAS EXTERNAL NAMEcode specifier asp  precodeAS EXTERNAL NAME [AssemblyName].[ClassName].[FunctionName] codepre  pThe database project refers the assembly as codeExternal.dllcode, and in VS2010 project properties under Application, Assembly name is External.

Negative 378 pI have an InnoSetup installer that can usually run as nonadmin, but in some cases it needs to run with elevated privileges if a condition is met.

Negative 378 pI am trying to figure out the correct way to handle the following scenario with synchronization in python. Say there is a shared resource codeconnectioncode which is used by 8 threads to issue commands over a connection. Occasionally, codeconnectioncode goes stale and will throw exceptions for which I added an exception handling routine which can reestablish the connection. p  pThe issue is such that when the connection goes stale, all 8 threads will get the exceptions. To solve this, I can add a semaphore such that only one thread will try to reestablish the connection at a time, but even this has an issue as well.p  pIf thread 1 is the first to acquire the semaphore, then threads 28 will soon be blocked on that semaphore when they encounter exceptions. Thread 1 will get a fresh connection which threads 28 can use successfully and will release the semaphore. p  pAt this point, what I would like to happen is to have threads 28 being processing again, however, since they were previously blocked on the semaphore, thread 2 now becomes unblocked on the semaphore and tries to reestablish the connection emagainem which thread 1 is now already trying to use. This can result is a cascading problem where threads keep trying to use the connection while other threads are trying to reestablish it. Is there a standard paradigm for dealing with a shared resource such as thisp
Negative 378 pI have an app that monitors location changes via the significant change notification feature of CoreLocation, this works fine as I only need to know about location changes when they change a lot like entering a different county or similar event. p  pMy issue is that I need to know if a user stays in a location for a long period of time, so if the user stays in one place for a day or a week I would need a notification on each day. p  pDoes CoreLocation provide that information If not, does anyone have a suggestion on how this might be achievedp

Negative 378 pNewbie to parallel programming with a question. If I have an array declared in a class that will undergo some simple math operations, is it possible to send each instance of that class to a different processor so the array for each predefined instance can be operated on at the same time I could be wrong, but that seems to make more sense than breaking down each array into segments to be sent to different processors where they will be operated on as each array is far less than a million in length, and I am guessing there would be some savings in overhead if Im not splitting up arrays, but rather sending whole arrays to different processors to be operated on at the same time. There will be two instances of the class and two processors. If it is possible, how do I go about doing it please. Thank you,p  pBearp

Negative 378 pI am working on a camera module for my game.  I am specifically designing it to work with very large amounts of randomly generated data.  The data are in the form of 2d chunks.  They are labeled and referenced by actual x, y coordinates.  Each chunk has a group attached to it in order to contain the images associated with it.  I have a group that contains only the chunks that are on screen  my simple simple attempt at culling .  When the player moves in any direction by the width of a chunk, all the current chunks need to shift in the table by one element and a new row  or column  of chunks needs to be loaded in the edge row  or column .  My problem comes when I do the shifting.  I am getting an error that says that I have either already removed that image group or its parent group.  The problem is that I havent done this.  The following code is the section I am having issues in  I think the whole code is to large to post all at once p  pNote  At the VERY end is the section where the removal of elements occurs.

Let me know if you require additional information.p  pIve also tried it this wayp  precode lr  ThisWorkbook.SheetsAnalysis.CellsRows.count, 12.EndxlUp.row     RangeSelection, Selection.EndxlDown.Select      ActiveCell.RangeA1A amp lr, L1L amp lr.Select     ActiveCell.Offset1, 10.RangeG1.Activate     ActiveSheet.Shapes.AddChart.Select       ActiveChart.SetSourceData SourceSheetsAnalysis.RangeA1A amp lr, L1L amp lr.EntireColumn codepre  pBut this just screws up everythingp

Negative 378 pI try to understand how responsiveness works in the defaultbootstrap theme of Prestahsop 1.6. Although I not new newbie, the lot of homework done regarding this was futile.p  pstrongSituationstrong Lets take an example and focus on it This theme allows the choice between two options for displaying the list of products Grid and List. On click on one of their anchors, the product list change from Grid to List without neither page reload, nor url change in the adress bar.p  pstrongProblemsstrong My goal is to add some data to the list displayed in both display options. So, I customized the template file codeproductlist.tplcode in order to print the additional attribute.The line of code executed. Butp  ul liThe printed element appear only in the Grid displaying not the List.li liWhen I swap between the two styles going back from List to Grid the added element dont show.li ul  pstrongMy current understandingstrongp  pI used to use developement tools in Chrome to find event listener breakpoints. In other words, a click on an anchor with class codelargecode lead me to the file where the code.large.onclickcode event is binded and let me find the javascript performed actions. But under the defaultbootstrap theme, this operation only leads me to codejquery1.1.10.min.jscode which isas you know a minimified file of the jQuery library. I expected finding another file that contains the event listener that uses this library something like code.large.onclick....code. p  pstrongQuestionsstrong How to find the specific javascript code that performs the update of page content on click Which is the filefiles that hold the reponsiveness of the current theme In all my js files, I dont find any   classname of elements triggering actions something like codelargecode.p  pstrongEdit Based on David Taiaroa answerstrong The class of the unordered list codeltulgtcode changes from codegridcode to codelistcode after click on the anchors. But there is not much styles attached to these classes. What is happening is that all the content of the codeltligtcodes is altered. Normally I should find something like codeul.toggleClassgridcode andor some jQueryAJAX  How to find AJAX code if any exist in this actual theme Even in Network, there is no GET requests after click like usually when AJAX is used. Thats odd, is it maybe related to the way Bootstrap worksp  pYour help is so much invaluable to me. Thanks in advance.p  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pThe file that contains the concerned javascript in the defaultbootstrap theme of Prestashop 1.6 is codeglobal.jscode. I investigated based on SourcesEventListeners breakpoints under Chrome Dev Tools which was misleading me. I was equally jumping this file while checking my js files in the source code.

Negative 378 pI have been learning Java over the last few months and I have a decent understanding of how inner classes are constructed, but I am confused as to why the choice to force the codefinalcode keyword on local variables.p  pWhen creating an anonymous inner class, the compiler automatically creates a constructor for us and the inner class has an instance field that receives a copy of the local variable. As Jom explains a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma31254562605221herea. His code p  precodeclass InnerClass extends Thread      private EventHandler handle      public InnerClassEventHandler handle          this.handle  handle           public void run          handle.onEvent       codepre  pThus if we do, p  precodeclass myClass      public void go       int a  4  obviously wont compile. Need final keyword     newClass n  new newClass          public void useA            do something with a                   a  5        codepre  pthe actual value that is passed into the n constructor is the value of 4 but developer might expect 5 which is equivalent to,p  precodeint a  4 newClass n  newClassa  n has an instance field of 4. int a  5  ...not 5  codepre  pbut in this case its more obvious that the value that is passed in to the constructor is the last known value of a 4 in this case. Where in the inner class example the developer might expect the value of a that is used in the method to be the last known value of a 5. Thus the reason java requires the use of the codefinalcode keyword is to keep the developer from harming himher self by expecting an inner class to have a reference to the last updatedchanged value of the local variable rather then the reference before the creation of the inner class This then makes the decision a readabilitypolitical choice over a performanceusability choice.p  pHopefully my question is clear.p
Negative 378 pSo Im a proficient SAS user but very new to R.

The result is thrown into a series of macro calls that are stored in a macro variable which is called after you define the macro.p  pI assume the way to do this in R is to generate a function to do this, but I failed there.

Negative 378 pWe require unmanaged code for our project.  The project compiles and runs perfectly in our 32bit environment. However, when we deploy to azure the project fails when trying to access the dll 32bit and 64bit.

Even though we are building with x64 from a 32bit machine, the project still runs as 32bit on azure.  p  pIs there a way to build and deploy a 64bit application to azure with our 32bit machine or do we need to upgrade our machines to 64bitp

Negative 378 pIm trying to create my own framework for iOS and I am encountering many problems. I followed Ray Wenderlichs tutorial herep  pa hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com65964createaframeworkforios relnofollowhttpwww.raywenderlich.com65964createaframeworkforiosap  pAnd successfully created my framework. I dragged it into one of my apps and tried to start using it. Before I got very far I was being complained at by the compiler that there was an Apple MachO Linker Error due to a global variable declared with extern in one of the header files of my framework being referenced by one of the classes of my framework. Though this was annoying the particular global variable in question was not necessary in that situation, so I removed the reference to it from the file that was being complained about. I deleted my framework from my app, rebuilt the aggregate target that Ray Wenderlich told me to create and then readded the framework to my app. After attempting to run my app anew with the revised framework I was shocked to find that I was getting the same error. This makes no sense to me because I deleted the problem variable from the problem file, but it still thinks that that class is referencing that variable. After trying every possible combination of cleaning and rebuilding things, I have inferred that somewhere the very first iteration of my framework is still stored in my app. I cannot find it to replace it. If anyone could help me figure out the best way to cleanly make an edit to my framework and add the new framework to my app I would be very grateful.p

Negative 378 pOK VB.net gurus. Riddle me this. I am beginning to use the little application I described in an earlier post. Updating the SDF file from a data table is pathetically slow. It is only very slow for a few hundred records. I updated the SDF file from a table of about 3,000 records and it took 8.5 minutes. In other words about the speed that a good fast typist could achieve doing data entry from the keyboard.  I have tried to upload a table with 100,000 records several times without success. I am using a machine with a fast quadcore processor, 64 bit Win7, and 8 gigs of RAM. So processor speed and available RAM should not be an issue. The resulting table should be less than 100 Megs so the size limit on an SDF file should not be an issue either. The issue seems to be the row by row updating process. In my research I have not found an alternative. Any suggestions would be helpful.p

If it is found, a codeForumcode object is returned.li licodeForum.getitemthreadscode is called. A codeThreadsDispatchcode object is returnedli licodeThreadsDispatch.getitem1code is called. The database is queried for a codeThreadcode 1 in codeForumcode 1. If it is found, a codeThreadcode object is returned and view lookup begins, or a codeKeyErrorcode is raised.li ol  pNow, for the first URL, a single query is issued. It would look like codeSELECT ... FROM forums WHERE forums.id  1code. In the second URL, two queries are issued. codeSELECT ... FROM forums WHERE forums.id  1code, and codeSELECT ... FROM threads WHERE thread.id  1 AND forum.id  1code.p  pI dont want two queries to be issued. For the second URL, the query codeSELECT ... FROM forums LEFT JOIN threads ON threads.forumid  forums.id WHERE threads.id  1 AND forums.id  1code would return all the information needed. Then, I could return a KeyError if no rows are returned, or if a codeForumcode is returned but not a codeThreadcode.p  pIn order to accomplish this, the codeForumDispatch.getitemcode needs to behave differently e.g. change the query, or dont query at all if it knows that threads is also going to be called next.p  pIs there any way to accomplish thisp  pI could, instead of returning actual database objects, create dummy resources to be returned by codeForumDispatch.getitemcode and the like, and then have the view perform the necessary query. But, I feel like Im losing out on some of the traversal functionality by making the view worry about queryingraising 404 errors. Thoughtsp

Negative 378 pI have a CakePHP website used by multiple clients. Each client shall be able to see slightly different input fields in forms. This is due to client preferences.p  pA simplified example Clients should be able to look up books from a big list. While some clients prefer to look up by author, others might want to look up by publish date or title. But each client should only see one input field in his search page. I dont want to bother the client with too many choices.p  pWhile creating different themes and switching them for each client is an option, it quickly becomes a lot of work if we are talking about many views and many input fields. Same for placing lots of ifelse in the view files.p  pThe Controller logic could be shared for all clients, as an empty or not existing input field will be ignored by my controller when looking up books.p  pOptimal I have some kind of dynamic configuration which states for each client which input field to show or hide on which page.p  pLet me know any suggestions on this or what is a good CakePHP way to achieve this.p

Negative 378 pI am a newbie in iOS. I want to set Launch Image in my app. And Im using Asset Catalog. And I know I have to drag and drop the image to the boxes that shows up when Im using Asset Catalog. But a weird thing which is happening at that time is when Im trying to dragdrop, it just comes back . As if Xcode is telling me NO PLACE HERE. Xcode doesnt let me set my Launch Images. Im not able to DROP my images in those boxes. And I know the sizes of my images are quite correct. 640960, 6401136, 7501334, 12422208.And I dont want to use LaunchScreen because it only supports iOS 8 and later.p  pIts even more weird that people are down voting without even telling the reason. If you are not good enough to help at least dont discourage newbiesp

When I click to navigate away from the account page I find that I am no longer logged in. An annoying work around that I have found is to then hit the back button, click Try Again on the Document Expired page, then click Resend in the alert box. This reloads the original account page and after that I stay logged in while navigating the site. Is there another way to do this Is it cookies or sessionid related I was hoping I could pass something to the site to stay logged in. Thanksp

Negative 378 pI have been using angular for a little bit now. Lately private variables belonging to factories have been bothering me.

I went back and started reading about the fundementals of Javascript and ran across closures. I thought closures might be the answer to my question. I havent completely pieced it together though.p  pSo my question is  In the example why does privateVar get stored If publicVar was a function then I would understand why privateVar got stored, namely closures. But, in this case, where publicVar is an Object, I am not sure what is keeping privateVar from being garbage collected.p

Negative 378 pWe have reinstalled ProGet as we rebuilt our server after a security hole was discovered unrelated to ProGet. The feed is visible in the browser, but inaccessible in Visual Studio. p  pWhile rebuilding our server, we have ProGet running on a temporary Azure server, which is working and serving our NuGet packages. In comparing the two, one notable difference is the API endpoint URL for the feed. For the ProGet on Azure, it is a reasonable looking, fully qualified URL.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMlXhA.png altenter image description here On the ProGet were attempting to set up while building our new server, it actually contains a password and the word Default we have deprecated this password.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.combla3p.png altenter image description here This doesnt seem to be right, but I dont think it can be changed.

Negative 378 pI see that with code.ajaxcode I can use the codedataTypecode property to tell jQuery what kind of response I expect from the server, usually codejsoncode.p  pBut then on the server side, how do I know the data type that was requestedp  pI understand that normally the server should know what to send based on the content of the request, but my use case is a bit different here. I have an error handler built in PHP and Id like to know in which format do I output the debug info. In case of fatalsyntax errors, warnings, the script may not even reach the request handler function associated with the request.p  pTheres a codeCONTENTTYPEcode header but apparently its always codeapplicationxwwwformurlencodedcode, and its only sent on codePOSTcode requests.p  pAnd theres a codeHTTPACCEPTcode header that looks like codeapplicationjson, textjavascript,  q0.01code.

Negative 378 pi have a serious problem I have set up my first root server and i have no experience with server security. I used to run some node apps on localhost but now i have to run a app on that server. The node app works. I have specified in my index.js file that the server listens on port 3000. The app loads without a problem on port 3000 but it is also available at port 80. WTF p  pCurrently my iptables file allows everything for testing purposes. The file looks like thisp  precodeA INPUT j ACCEPT A FORWARD j ACCEPT A OUTPUT j ACCEPT codepre  pif that makes any difference or it has something to do with my issue...p  pWhat is the reason for the app listening on port 80p  pPS The app is ONLY available at 80 and 3000, as soon as i tested. Im using the express framework btw...p
Negative 378 pIn order to prepare an optimization in an existing software framework, I performed a standalone performance test, so I could assess potential gains before spending a large amount of time on it.p  h2The Situationh2  pThere are codeNcode different types of components, some of which implement an codeIUpdatablecode interface  those are the interesting ones. They are grouped in codeMcode objects, each maintaining a list of components. Updating them works like thisp  precodeforeach GroupObject obj in objects      foreach Component comp in obj.Components              IUpdatable updatable  comp as IUpdatable         if updatable  null             updatable.Update       codepre  h2The Optimizationh2  pMy goal was to optimize these updates for large amounts of grouping objects and components. First, make sure to update all components of one kind in a row, by caching them in one array per kind. Essentially, thisp  precodeforeach IUpdatable[] compOfType in typeSortedComponents      foreach IUpdatable updatable in compOfType              updatable.Update       codepre  pThe thought behind it was that the JIT or the CPU might have an easier time operating on the same object type over and over again than in a shuffled version.p  pIn the next step, I wanted to further improve the situation by making sure that all data for one Component type is aligned in memory  by storing it in a struct array, something like thisp  precodeforeach ComponentDataStruct[] compDataOfType in typeSortedComponentData      for int i  0 i lt compDataOfType.Length i              compDataOfType[i].Update       codepre  h2The Problemh2  pIn my standalone performance tests, there is no significant performance gain from either of these changes. Im not sure why. emNo significant performance gainsem means, with 10000 components, each batch running 100 update cycles, all main tests take around 85 milliseconds  2 milliseconds. p  pThe only difference arises from introducing the codeascode cast and codeifcode check, but thats not really what I was testing for.p  ul liAll tests were performed in Release mode, without attached debugger.li lipExternal disturbances were reduced by using this codep  precode    currentProc.ProcessorAffinity  new IntPtr2     currentProc.PriorityClass  ProcessPriorityClass.High     currentThread.Priority  ThreadPriority.Highest codepreli lipEach test actually did some primitive math work, so its not just measuring empty method calls which could potentially be optimized away.pli liGarbage Collection was performed explicitly before each test, to rule out that interference as well.li liThe full source code VS Solution, Build amp Run is available a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms5gp6f6y3cnbaf6aFastUpdatePerformanceTest.zipdl0 relnofollowhereali ul  pI would have expected a significant change due to memory alignment and repetition in update patterns.

Negative 378 pI am using a MasterDetail layout using a SplitViewController. The detail view is filled with an MKMapView, and each time a cell is pressed in the master view, a popover appears over a corresponding annotation point on the map.p  pThe problem is, if I press cell 1, then in order to press cell 2 and see its popover on the map, I need to somehow dismiss the first popover, because the popovers freeze the rest of the UI, i.e. nothing is interactable without first dismissing the popover.p  pWhat I would love to do is to remove this freezing functionality from the popover, i.e. anytime anything else outside the popover is tapped, the popover should dismiss and whatever else was tapped should be activated a button, a cell, a different annotation, doesnt matterp  pI have a partial solution, which looks like thisp  precodeoverride public func mapViewmapView MKMapView, didSelectAnnotationView view MKAnnotationView    if pvc  nil     pvc.dismissPopoverAnimatedfalse    pvc  UIPopoverControllercontentViewController cvc  pvc.popoverContentSize  CGSizeMakewidth,height  pvc.presentPopoverFromRectview.frame, inView view.superview, permittedArrowDirections UIPopoverArrowDirection.Any, animated true  pvc.passthroughViews  [self.view] codepre  pWhat the above does is this allow the map self.view to be interactable despite the the popover being presented, and now when another annotation is tapped, since codepvc  nilcode, it will first dismiss the existing one and then present the new one.p  pHowever, since the master and detail classes are separate, I have no way to do something similar for tapping on cells since.p  pIs there a way to add the cells in the master view to the passthroughViews array, and some way to tell the cell which annotation was tapped beforehand and then dismiss that popoverp  pId appreciate any helpp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 378 pI run a small Facebook app that uses its users news feed via the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsgraphapireferenceuserhomecodemehomecode API endpointa and the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsfacebookloginpermissionsreferencereadstreamcodereadstreamcode permissiona. Facebook doesnt actually grant codereadstreamcode to plain old normal apps, so my users create their own FB app and use its keysecret, which works.p  pSadly, Facebook is a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsappschangelogv24deprecationsturning off the codemehomecode endpoint altogethera in two months, on Oct. 6. I get their intent, but Im hoping theres some way to keep my app running.

The pattern may change and break this code at some point in the future and I may not be here to explain this code when the comment fails to illuminate its purpose.  The weirdest thing about this is that it seems to be intermittent.  Sometimes the parameter names are good and sometimes theyre not.  Any advice is appreciated.p
