Positive 6367 pI have just installed zurbfoundation into my rails project that was already using Fullcalendar. After the install i immediately noticed that most of fullcalendars styling was messed with, some really obvious bugs occuring shaded areas now only half covering dates, button hoverstate is now half filled blue for no reason. Ideally id like my jsscss framework to have no effect on fullcalendars and other js plugins styles.p  pThere are a couple of potential solutionsp  pI could only take in bits of foundations SCSS and javascript so that i avoid the conflicting areas. I can find how to do this for the JS, but the SCSS doesnt seem to work when i remove  require foundation it seems to keep the scss there anyway, even when i try deleting the cache.p  pI could find the culprit areas of foundation and change them, but i dont really know where to start with that, the foundation file structure is weirdp  pLastly, i could ditch the framework all together and use something less invasive. As i can deal with making my own grid, and my own media queries, i have at least one front end man telling me to ditch frameworks all together, but i am just not much of a designer, so i was after buttons and navbars that look good out of the box. Are there good recommendations for lighter weighted sass frameworks that wont mess with stuff so much Or should i just roll up my sleeves and style my own buttons from scratch...p

Thanks for that.p  pHowever Im working on a framework that will be used by multiple people in my company. br Therefore Id like to keep all mixins as foolproof and easy to use as possible.p  pIn that case thisp  precodeinclude flexboxcolumn  codepre  pWould be preferred over thisp  precodeinclude flexboxdirection column codepre  pBecause other devs know what flexbox can do, but not how I named my arguments.p  pIts a small thing, really. But the use of named arguments would mean that everyone would have to learn the argumentnames of every mixin available. p

Negative 6367 pWe are working on designing an application that is typically OLTP think purchasing system. However, this one in particular has the need that some users will be offline, so they need to be able to download the DB to their machine, work on it, and then sync back once theyre on the LAN.p  pI would like to note that I know this has been done before, I just dont have experience with this particular model.p  pOne idea I thought about was using GUIDs as table keys. So for example, a Purchase Order would not have a number autonumeric but a GUID instead, so that every offline client can generate those, and I dont have clashes when I connect back to the DB.p  pIs this a bad idea for some reason Will access to these tables through the GUID key be slowp  pHave you had experience with these type of systems How have you solved this problemp  pThanksbr  Danielp

Negative 6367 pI am implementing NHibernate into an existing web application. However, we have some other processes that do bulk inserting and updating on the database. How can I make NHibernate aware that changes are occurring on the backend db that were not initiated through NHibernatep  pMost of the info that I have read around NHibernate use in asp.net have mentioned storing the Session object in the HttpContext or CallContext. This would then store the session object for the duration of the application lifecycle. This is what I have implemented. I was afraid of the costs of initializing NHibernate on each request. Isnt there a significant performance hit with this approach with initializing the Session object on each requestp  pAlso, would it make more sense to store the SessionFactory in the the HttpContext or CallContext so that the mappings dont have to be regenerated on each requestp

Negative 6367 pRecently, the SourceSafe integration into visual studio has started to perform badly because we have moved, and the SourceSafe server is located across a VPN which goes across a slow connection. This has made loading large projects in visual c 6 take 5 minutes because it has to talk to the server for each project. Also, there are some bugs that are dangerous in the integration the autocheckout of certain shared projects will do a get latest on the wrong version of a branched file. This has caused me to want to disable the SourceSafe integration, however I have not found any menu option or uninstall option. Google has reported a few registry tweaks, but none of them seemed to work.p  pDoes anyone know of an easy way to remove the SourceSafe integration from Visual C 6, without uninstalling SourceSafe altogetherp

Negative 6367 pI recently got a new laptop. Unfortunately, it came with Vista. Its been one big hassle getting it to work, and the comp has hardware components for which there are no XP drivers, so I cant upgrade to an OS that actually works. Ive mostly gotten things working, but one particularly odd problem has me stumped.p  pI installed Delphi and tried to build a project. It compiled, but wouldnt run. This application failed to start because sdl.dll was not found. Fair enough. So I grabbed SDL.dll and put it in the codeCwindowssystem32code folder.  Using Vista 64bit Home Premium. This is a 32bit dll, though, so I put it in the 32 folder instead of the 64 one.p  pHit Run again. Same problem. But why Thats where it goes, right  And codeCwindowssystem32code is in the system path. Anyone know why it cant link to the DLLp  pAnd yes, I know that I can work around the problem by putting the DLL in the same folder as the .exe. Im currently doing that as a workaround. Its a bad idea in the long term, though, because I have a handful of different projects that all require SDL.p

My question is when does it make sense to use one or the otherp  pWhat I can tell from initial glancing is that VideoDisplay responds to mouse events because it inherits from IntaractiveObject, but Im not sure if its a real difference, because Video seems to have a workaround for this in that you can add your own event listeners.p  pTheres probably more to it, but this is the only difference I can see now. So my question for those who used these objects extensively, can you share your experience when you use one over the other.p

Negative 6367 pI have various binary file formats which I need to dump to some kind of text format, edit and then recompile possibly to a slightly different version of the binary format. Of course I could write a bunch of utility code in CC to do this kind of thing, and maybe leverage a library for the text side of things XML or JSON or whatever, but this is a task pattern that keeps cropping up in my work and it seems to me that there probably ought to exist already some kind of general purpose tool for this kind of job.p  pObviously there would need to be some way of describing the binary file formats  a schema or some such  this would need to support all the obvious data types strings, ints of various sizes, bools, etc, floats would be nice too, and things like count fields, length fields, paddingalignment, etc, to handle all the typical stuff that you find in a data file. It would also be useful to have endianness support, as the binary file may have a different endianness than the platform were running on.p  pId be very surprised if something like this doesnt exist already, but I have had no luck so far via Google how do you even describe such a utility or library succinctly . The closest thing to this I ever remember seeing was Apples resource compilerdecompiler utilities back in the days of Classic Mac OS.

Negative 6367 pI run multiple websites all running off of a single installation of CodeIgniter on my server separate application directories and a single system directory.

Then when I make a file change it will immediately propagate to all of the downstream websites.  It will still require that I test each one for errors, but I wont have to make the changes multiple times.  Anything that is specific to a single website will either be a nonshared file still in the linked directory just not used elsewhere or can be put in a local helper.p  pAlso, I keep separate system directories by CI version so I can migrate my websites independently if necessarythis central libraries file would be attached to a specific version to reduce possible breaks.p  pDoes anyone see potential issues or pitfalls from taking this approach  Has anyone accomplished this in another direction that I should considerp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 6367 pWe have a legacy VB6 application that uses Crystal Reports XI to generate printed reports. Weve found through experience that the Crystal Reports print engine crashes if it picks up the wrong version of strongusp10.dllstrong the Windows Uniscribe library. p  pOne customer is consistently having printing issues on their Windows 7 machines running Windows 7 Enterprise, 32bit. However, we have a few other customers running various editions of Windows 7 that are not having any problems.p  pOn one of the machines that was having printing issues, I noticed that there was an older version of codeusp10.dllcode one incompatible with Crystal Reports XI in the folder codeCProgram FilesCommon FilesMicrosoft SharedOffice10code. Im not sure what application installed these files, because the customer doesnt have Office 2002 installed so I assume another application installed them. However, I temporarily renamed the file and our application was able to print correctly, so it seems that our application was loading that version of the file originally, which was causing the crashes.p  pThe crash only happens the moment the user tries to print a report. Our application has direct dependencies on strongcraxdrt.dllstrong the Crystal Reports ActiveX Designer Runtime library and strongcrviewer.dllstrong the Crystal ActiveX Report Viewer library, and the crash happens whether we print directly through strongcraxdrt.dllstrong or through the Report Viewer control.p  pIn the past, we have resolved this issue by copying a known good version of strongusp10.dllstrong into our applications directory and creating an em.localem file to enable DLL redirection. At the customer site, I tried this, and also tried the alternate approach of creating a em.localem folder for our EXE and placing the strongusp10.dllstrong in there, but neither approach worked on the machine I was connected to.p  pI did notice that strongusp10.dllstrong is a known DLL in Windows it has an entry in codeHKEYLOCALMACHINESystemCurrentControlSetControlSession ManagerKnownDLLscode, but I tested our application on another Windows 7 machine running Professional Edition, 32bit here that also had the DLL listed as a known DLL in the registry, and by using emDependency Walkerem, I could see that the redirection was working on that computer. This is somewhat confusing, since the Microsoft a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms68260028VS.8529.aspx relnofollowdocumentationa states that known DLLs cannot be redirected. Also, as I implied in the question title, our main EXE does not use a manifest file the Microsoft documentation states that the presence of a manifest, embedded or standalone, disables DLL redirection.p  pSo, my question is, is there any other reason why DLL redirection would work on some machines and not others, and does this have anything to do with differences between Windows 7 and Windows XP I had considered deleting everything in the codeKnownDLLscode registry key, but since the redirection was working on a machine here that had the same set of codeKnownDLLscode, Im not sure that would actually resolve the issue, and I dont want to delete that key if I dont need to. I havent yet had a chance to connect to the customers machine again to run emDependency Walkerem, but Im not sure I would be able to interpret its logs anyway even on the machine where it was working, I saw a lot of emLoadLibraryem calls for strongusp10.dllstrong pointing to a folder other than the redirected folder, but some calls were apparently redirected, so Im not sure what that means either.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrong I should have also mentioned that every computer weve checked also has another copy of codeusp10.dllcode in the codeSystem32code folder. Looking at Chriss a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3400168aretherereasonswhydllredirectionwontworkotherthanthepresenceofaman34007173400717answera and a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comblarryostermanarchive20040719187752.aspx relnofollowthis blog posta by Larry Osterman explaining a bit more about how known DLLs work, I realized that that probably doesnt factor into the problem at all, since our program isnt loading the copy of codeusp10.dllcode that is in the codeSystem32code folder.p  hr  pstrongEDIT 2strong After playing around with emDependency Walkerem some more on my VB6 development machine Windows XP SP3, where the printing has always worked, I was able to glean some information. I profiled our application in emDependency Walkerem and set it to log full path names, and it looks like one of the Crystal Reports dependencies another Crystal Reports DLL tries to load strongusp10.dllstrong from multiple hardcoded paths before giving up and just asking for it by filename. It turns out that it tries to load it from the Crystal Reports codebincode folder first, then tries to load it from from codeCProgram FilesCommon FilesMicrosoft SharedOffice10usp10.dllcode. If it cant find it at either location, it just asks Windows for codeusp10.dllcode which will grab the one in codeSystem32code. But even this isnt consistent. Sometimes it asks for the file in the codeOffice10code folder, and then appears to ignore the fact that it couldnt find the file, while other times there are a series of emLoadLibraryem calls where it looks like the Crystal Reports code is actively looking for alternate copies of the file in different locations. Even more confusing is that at least one of the Crystal Reports components looks like it actually has a loadtime dependency on strongusp10.dllstrong, so that component always seems to get the copy in codeSystem32code.p  pIm still not 100 clear emwhyem the code.localcode redirection wouldnt work in this situation on this customers computers, but I think that partly explains why this particular customer is having problems, since all of the computers with the problem have an codeOffice10code folder with an apparently incompatible version of codeusp10.dllcode in it.p  pBut, once again, Im still left with the basic question if these components are looking for this file in so many different places, how can I guarantee that they will all use the emsameem copyp

Negative 6367 pI add the tipsy tooltip to divs with the .placeTaken class. The user can then drag boxes around, so I remove the class and add it to a new div instead. When this happens, I add a new tipsy tooltip to that div and that works fine, but I want to remove the old one. p  pThey say if you wish to remove the tooltip by setting the title attribute to an empty string, set the originaltitle attribute instead. I tried codedropFromId.attroriginaltitle, code but the tooltip is still there. I cant even change the tooltip title by setting another originaltitle.p  pWhat am I doing wrongp  pEdit I guess I didnt give you guys enough information. I use ajax to grab the places that are taken from the database. The PHP returns an associative array customers that I then use in my JavaScript where the taken place matches a name. The places that are taken changes when dropping, so I perform the ajax function again to update the array with all the taken places. At fist, I add the tipsy tooltip to all the taken places like sop  precodemap div.placeTaken.tipsygravity w, html true, fade true, title     function          id could for example be map74, substring to 74         var id  this.attrid.substring3,6         return ltdivgtcustomers[id]ltdivgtltbr gt       codepre  pSo the title is equal to what matches that place in the array.

Negative 6367 pIm currently fooling around with AJAX. Right now, I created a Markdown previewer that updates on change of a textarea.

A user writes something, an event is called, the post is written.p  pBut on the other clients pages, the new post is of course not yet available until they reload and get the updated list of posts from the database.p  pNow, how can you get this to work asynchronously So in that moment when one client does something, the other clients all get to know that he did somethingp  pI dont think this can be done completely in AJAX, but I also have no idea whatsoever how to implement this on serverside, as it would require a page reload to inform the other clients of the event.p  pIm thinking of creating a file or database entry that hashes the current state of data. Whenever a client loads the page, he saves this hash. Then, a timer does this exist in JavaScript checks for the hash every few seconds.p  pAs soon as anyone changes the databse, the hash is recalculated. If the script sees that the hash was changed and is different to the one saved, it reloads the contents form the database and saves the new hash.p  pIs that even going to workp

My employer wanted highly optimized code for computationally difficult tasks.

As I understood it then, recursion overhead was the extra effort required to push data onto a stack and later pop it off.p  pNow I code in C, Python, Perl, and sometimes Java, and I wonder sometimes about recursions.

Negative 6367 pThis might be a bit vague, but I am working on a program where several classes that update the UI. I have made a middleman class that basically takes all the UI requests among other things and routes them to the UI itself, that way the UI class only interacts with the middleman. p  pThe problem is that the UI class has 20 different functions in its interface, and all my middleman class does is basically take calls from the lowerlevel classes and then call an essentially identical function in the UI, which makes me wonder if this is somehow defeating the whole purpose.

Is there any similar library for C I worked with MFC, but I am not sure that MFC is as good as WPF when working on projects that needs to show images and the GUI is very important.p

The value of codersidcode doesnt become an integer or even a variant. It becomes some sort of codeAutomationcode type and cannot be evaluated as a number.

Negative 6367 pIn boolean retrieval model query consist of terms which are combined together using different operators. Conjunction is most obvious choice at first glance, but when query length growth bad things happened. Recall dropped significantly when using conjunction and precision dropped when using disjunction for example, codestanford OR universitycode.p  pAs for now we use conjunction is our search system and boolean retrieval model. And we have a problem if user enter some very rare word or long sequence of word. For example, if user enters codetoyota corolla 4wd automatic 1995code, we probably doesnt have one. But if we delete at least one word from a query, we have such documents. As far as I understand in Vector Space Model this problem solved automatically. We does not emfilterem documents on the fact of term presence, we emrankem documents using presence of terms.p  pSo Im interested in more advanced ways of combining terms in boolean retrieval model and methods of rare term elimination in boolean retrieval model.p

Negative 6367 pIm new to Team Foundation Server, and Im currently working on setting up an automated build strategy for my project. One bit of confusion Im having is how to setup automated builds that match our source controldevelopment structure.p  pIt is company policy that under a TFS project, we include the folders trunk and branches. Trunk represents and contains our production code. Branches obviously holds branches under development.p  pId like to setup CI continuous integration builds for branches, and a Gated checkin build for trunk. My thinking is that this will virtually eliminate any problems with trunk builds when its time to rollout to production. I do however have a few questions about all of thisp  pstrong1. Does my strategy make sensestrong Is it too redundant Does it create unforeseen issues etc.p  pstrong2. Does a merge constitute a checkin that will a trigger a CI or Gated buildstrong If developers will merge their development branches into trunk, Id like this to trigger the trunk build. Perhaps a Gated build here is an unnecessary redundancyp  pAny guidance you can give me is most appreciated. Thank you in advancep  pemDevelopment environment TFS 2010, VS 2010 Ultimate, Windows Server 2008 R2emp

Im receiving the errorCode value correctly on the client from both web services. But I have a complex type called Inventory that I receive as part of the response It doesnt appear in the responses I have included above cause it will take me some time to populate the appropriate data on the web service. The InventoryItem contains fields of different data types String, Calendar. What I have noticed is that the response from the Axis 2 web service contains the codeltaxs21gtcode xml tag whereas in the Axis 1 web service, its not there. So Im assuming that I have a parsing problem on the client side with the response coming from the Axis 2 web service.p  pDoes anyone know how can I solve thisp

Negative 6367 pIm just baffled on this one.  Im using linq.js, which is a great library that adds LINQstyle extension methods to js and jQuery.  One of them is code.Enumerablecode, which is used to translate a jQuery list into another object that has the LINQ goodness.  This has worked fine for weeks.  p  pToday I did some refactoring, and this broke, but in a way that I cant figure out emat allem.  Specifically, Ive put debugging in and verified that code.Enumerablecode exists emuntilem document.ready is called, and in the ready callback rountine, code.Enumerablecode is undefined, even though it emwasem defined until document.ready was called.  So, something is resetting the global jQuery  object to a new one, or else unsetting the code.Enumerablecode property, but I cant figure out what.  And whatever it is just started today, but I cant see how any of my changes would have caused this I moved some stuff from one page to another, but AFAICT, everything is in the same order.  Hoping this rings a bell for someone who can point me in the right direction.p

Negative 6367 pI am building a program to poll a network device every 48 hours and record the output user Perl and the Expect module. At the moment, I am saving the output text to a text file and then filtering the text file to get the required information. Originally, this was fine since efficiency wasnt that big of a problem when dealing with file that are only a hundred KB in size and keeping most of the text anyway, but Ive found a new command I want to execute remotely on the network device. This command takes an hour and a half to run, creates a text file around 5MB in size and I would probably only be keeping 10KB of information. Using basic file IO read a text file, write to a text file just seems like a bad idea and I keep thinking that there has to be a better way.p  pWhat my research has turned up so far I should probably be using some sort of Pipe. Something like precodeopenfilehandle, myCommandprecode There are other solutions out there, but they seem to imply that I save the ENTIRE file to one variable, when I would like to only save and modify parts of it before writing to a file. TIEHANDLE works well for overwiting print, but I dont think thats necessary or will work here.p  pWhat Ive tried so far Redirecting STDOUT using a pipe. Result Kept on sending the output to a file and couldnt edit the text before it was put in the file.p  pI have run out of things to Google. If a complete solution is too daunting of a task, a hint as to where the next steps might be would also be greatly appreciated.p  pAlso, if the advantages in terms of processing time are actually minimal Im unclear on how  long it takes to process a 5mb test file and will investigate, please let me know.p

Negative 6367 pI posted this question a few days ago but made a hash of explaining the issue properly, so hopefully this attempt is clearer. I have run across a DBConcurrency error when attempting to use the C MySQLDataAdapter.Update function on my Datasource, which is a MYSQL database.p  pThe source of the DataTable I am manipulating in my C program is a table in the database which i extracted using the MySQLDataAdapter. I want to manipulate rows, then use the Update function of the DataAdapter to save the changes to the database. It works well for the most part, but I have discovered one difficult to solve problem involving autoincremented columns.p  pLets say the database table has a list of records likep  precode1 Apple 2 Orange 3 Banana 4 Pear codepre  pWhere the first ID column is autoincremented. I can fill a DataTable just fine and have it autoincrement by using MissingSchemaAction.AddWithKey and so on, and if I add a new record Grapes to the DataTable the autoincrement ID column will be 5 and the database will accept it when I run Update on it.p  pHowever, If I add the Grapes record to the DataTable, then delete it, and then add it again implausible I know, but it happens, the DataTable autoincrement just keeps ticking up, so now it looks like thisp  precode1 Apple 2 Orange 3 Banana 4 Pear 6 Grapes codepre  pAnd if i run the Update now, the Grapes record auto ID gets saved into the DATABASE table as 5, because thats where the database autoincrement is at, but in the DataTable its listed as 6, so theyre now out of sync and if I delete the Grapes row from the DataTable and run Update again, I get the error p  precodeConcurrency violation the DeleteCommand affected 0 of the expected 1 records. codepre  pon the Update line of my program.p  pIve looked around and it seems like this sort of desyncing can happen fairly regularly, but at this stage Im wondering if theres anything I can do about it without going back and tearing up most of the code Ive written.p

Negative 6367 pI have an Index action method that loads two view models which eventually calls 2 AJAX action methods. These two AJAX action methods depend on the response of a webservice calls. so only one call to this webservice is needed to fulfill the 2 ajax action methods dependency. The problem is that this webservice is quite slow and takes several seconds to complete a request. I would  like 1 to call the webservice once for both of these action methods. 2 prefetch the response by making an async call to the webservice call at the execution of the Index action method. The hope is to make the UI load faster.p  pMy worry is how do I delay the rendering of the 2 AJAX calls until the response from the async webservice call has completedp

Negative 6367 pHeres my use case.p  pI work on a multi language system that communicates over protobuf and zeromq between several different languages, one of which is C.p  pI want to implement a WCF JSON web service over our database and I want to use protocol buffers to ensure the correct json schema.

What I want is for ProtoBufClass to be the actual generated class which is common across all of our languages and for is to automatically be serialized to JSON for me.p  pIt would be extra cool if I could dop  precodehttphostService   gt protobuf message as json httphostService ltContentType protobufgt  formatprotobuf   gt serialized protobuf message codepre  pAny pointers on how to expose this service over a zeromq socket would also be much appreciated, Ive implemented protobuf RPC with python but Ive got no idea how to do it in Cp  pThanks Benp  pemeditem I forgot to mention that Im using protobufcsharpport as opposed to protobufnetp

Negative 6367 pIm using Aquamacs graphical emacs for OSX using emacs 24 and tramp version 2.2.3 to edit some files on a remote server. Tramp is set up to use strongsshstrong and works fine in terms of editing files. p  pIt fails when it comes to compiling because the compiler is not in the path. It seems like tramp does not source any of the profile files like strong.profilestrong or strong.bashprofilestrong. binsh is a link to binbash so bash should be the shell used by tramp. A shell started within emacs on the remote server wont source anything, too. A ssh connection from a regular terminal emulator tried emTerminalem and emX11em on OS X works as expected everything sourced correctly.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 6367 pI am working on a new layout for a page which is a wizard based ordering system for a client.  They order sets of materials but these materials can be grouped together during the order process such that they can order 10 widgets in any combination of red, blue, andor, green for example.  The sum total of the fields cant exceed the precalculated maximum.  Most of the materials are a simple single choice per group.p  pIve used jQuery validate in other pages and I have used the addClassRules method to validate all input elements on the page and its worked just fine.  The current example I am working on is baffling me because it only catches the first validation failure upon form submission but after submission it will usually catch others, but never the full list of validation failures.p  pHeres my jsfiddle sample so you can see what I am putting together a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netbrianmat2nV5u relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netbrianmat2nV5uap  pI use an error counting snippet that has worked on several sites without a problem.

Negative 6367 pIm not really sure how to word this exactly, so hopefully someone can make sense of it. Ive been working on an iPad app that syncs files from a server to your iPad and lets you build presentations with the various files. The corporation Im working with on this app has a wireless network that requires you to reauthenticate every hour. So every hour instead of getting the expected JSON api response, any HTTP request pulls down the page needed to reauth with the wireless network. I was wondering is there is a specific HTTP response code related to getting sent that page or a bestpractice way of testing for that page as opposed to JSON.p  pGranted I could just test to see if the response is HTML, but that doesnt account for other redirect responses that I havent found yet. I could just test part of the HTML to see if it matches a predetermined portion of the html, but Im an outside contractor. I cant guarantee they wont change the markup or verbiage of the page after Ive made my deliverable. p  pSo does anyone out in the ether know a best practices methodology for testing if the app needs to reauth before syncingp
Negative 6367 pIm working on the client side application of the clientserver chat Im doing for learning experience. My problem is I cant seem to get the socket and swing,both to run at the same time. p  pWhat I want to is, when the user opens a JOpionsPane and enters the hostname and port number, clicks okay, then they are connected. When the socket information was hardcoded it worked fine, but now Im trying to get the users input for it. p  pWhats meant to happen is, action listener is supposed to create the new SocketManager object that handles communication. Event though it says its connected, it doesnt run. When I create the new SocketManager object and run it on a new thread it connects and revives messages form the server, but then the swings freezes and I have to end the process to shut it down. p  pShould I start it on a new worker thread or something Maybe its just because Im tired, but Im out of ideas. p  pstrongEDITstrong I updated my ActLis.class and SocketManager.class with the suggestion of adding a new thread for my SocketManager object network.

Negative 6367 pI have a page with three tabs managed with jqueryui tabs. On tab is initially empty. When the user selects an item displayed on the first tab, i load the content of a third tab via ajax and select this tab. The content of this tab also has some javascript which is executed after loading. This all works fine,  yet, the javascript executed has no effect. Ive set   options cache and ajaxOptions cache to false, but still it is not working.  When I load the content of the third tab initially with some dummy parameters, that make no sense in practice , everything works.  So, for instance, my tab has a ...  end when I do   foo.hide it is still visible, and no error is shown.  Any hints p  pEDIT This is difficult, because the code is quite complex, yet I found something strange On tab 0 I have a jqGrid, on tab1 jqueryfileupload. Klicking a cell in the grid loads the content in tab1 fileupload. When selecting tab1 the fileupload is initalized. What is not working is the jquery.template part in fileupload, i.e. showing the files ready to upload. The upload itself works  Now I tried the same without jqgrid on the first page,I used two links and loaded the content of tab1 the same way as before. Now everything in fileupload works. Then I tried jqgrid with fileupload, but did not init tabs, so everything is shown on one page. Instead of calling tabsload,... I loaded the content via tabid.load, and now also everything works. So I have jqgrid working together with jquery.fileupload, ui.tabs together with jquery.fileupload, but not jqrid , uitabs and fileupload all together. And the part that seems not to work is jquery.template. p

Negative 6367 pI have a sidebar in my app that can be hiddenshown via a toggle button. It simply toggles a class on body that adds some margin left to the content area and hidesshows the sidebar.

Negative 6367 pI have a C application using WPF consisting of a single Window holding four Pages within Frames within a Grid.  The main Window receives messages via a socket.  I am attempting to send these messages to the appropriate Page for processing, but am not sure 1 how to correctly reference it and 2 how to either pass the message to the Page or call one of the Pages functions to handle the message.  The Window, Grid, Frames and Pages are constructed in xaml, in case that is relevant.p  pIn a similar windows forms application I wrote, I used delegates for callbacks.  The main window would receive a message, then Invoke a forms delegate  which looked something like thisp  precodeInvokemyFormInstance.myFormDelegateFunction, myMessage codepre  pWhere myFormInstance.MdiParent was set to this window.p  pIm basically trying to find the WPF equivalent, or perhaps a better way to do it.  Ive looked into the WPF dispatcher, which I believe may be a way to access Page components directly  but I want the Page itself to process the message and decide what components update and how.p  pAny advice  Is the dispatcher the answer to this somehowp  pThanks.p

Negative 6367 pI have a webbased pickingpacking solution for delivering orders asp.netc. Orders are marked as packed in the browser and then immediately the label information is added to our database, ready for the next part...p  pThe label printing is done via a Windows application written in C and was done this way because I couldnt find a way of getting the browser to print the label automatically i.e. without the user having to click PrintOK, etc.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pThe Windows application polls every 10 seconds subject to change to see if there are any new labels for that pickerpacker. Now, if I could get the browser to communicate with the label application then the polling would be unnecessary, since the pickerpacker would have just clicked Ready to Ship and the label data would be created.p  pThe data that is pulled down by the polling process isnt vast, but Im concerned that as we add more pickerpacker stations the polling process could have a knock on effect to the web serverdatabase since all stations would be polling. Also, pickerspackers dont want to wait around waiting for labels, so extending the polling time isnt possible if anything Id like it as quick as possiblep  pstrongSolutionsstrongp  pSo, ideally, Id like a way of communicating between the browser and the application if possible. Or any method that removes the need for polling. Perhaps something akin to Comet, that allows the server to send a message to the application when a new label is added.p  pIdeally, a solution that wouldnt require a specific browser. But this may be asking too much.p  pA longterm solution would be to move the webbased pickingpacking solution into the label application, but that would be a stronglotstrong of workp  pI hope thats clear and not too wordy. Let me know if I can add any other details in here. Thanks in advance.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pAm looking into websockets as an idea.

Negative 6367 pIm uploading files via AJAX to Amazon S3 using the browser File API and storing the actual upload script on Amazon S3 as an iframe to get around the Amazon S3 crosssite issues, courtesy to jqueryfileupload for the idea.  I have that working and it works great for small files lt 50 MB or so. However, Im looking to store extremely large files on Amazon S3. Id like to store things like a configured virtual machine, which could be 10 GB in size.p  pFrom my understanding of the HTML5 file API, large files can be chunked up into small bits on the client and uploaded. It is then the responsibility of the server code to join the files together and move the file to S3.  I understand the concept but am not sure of the best implementation.p  pIm using Heroku for the app server and I normally upload files directly to Amazon S3, skipping Herokus servers completely. However, if I chunk the upload into small bits, I would have to have some code that joins the parts before actually putting it in S3. But Heroku has some limitations on how much data can be used with them, and I dont think that joining a 10 GB file would work out effectively on their servers not 100 sure but doubtful.p  pSo my current thought is that I have to have a web service app setup on an Amazon EC2 server where my app posts the upload parts to.  The EC2 app is then responsible for joining the upload parts and putting the final joined file into S3. Once the file is loaded into S3, S3 sends a response to the original app hosted on Heroku, which then creates a resource that points to the stored file in S3.p  pIs there any realistic way of getting around having a separate EC2 server to join the files Theres no cost for sending files between EC2 and S3, but I dont want to have to maintain 2 apps to accomplish what I want main app on Heroku and the filejoining app on EC2.p
Negative 6367 pIm using Spring 2.5.4 and am creating a Java application that Im deploying onto Weblogic.p  pI have a class in an external library which included in the WEBINFclasses directory of the resulting WAR file of my application that I want to use in my code. Ive created an instance variable for an object of the class in my code and added the Autowired annotation and a getter and setter.

Negative 6367 pI am developing a multithreaded sqlite database application on an Ubuntu virtual machine that has 4 processors allocated to it. I am using sqlite version 3.7.13. I created a test to verify that multiple threadsconnections can read from the database at the same time.p  pI have two executables.  The first executable simply creates a database, creates 1 table in that database, inserts 50 items into that table, and then closes the database.  This does not involve any multithreading at all and is simply meant to provide a database with entries in it.p  pThe second executable creates multiple threads to read from the database and waits for them to finish and records the time that it took for all of the threads to complete.  Each thread does the following                 create a database connection using sqliteopenv2 so that each thread has its own individual connection to the database created from the first executable                 perform 100000 SELECTS on the one database table each select queries for one row in the table                 close the database connectionp  pWhen I ran this test with SQLITEOPENREADWRITE specified as the flags for sqliteopenv2 in each thread, I get the following results for total time to perform all queriesp  p1 Thread  0.65 seconds 2 Threads  0.70 seconds 3 Threads  0.76 seconds 4 Threads  0.91 seconds 5 Threads  1.10 seconds 6 Threads  1.28 seconds 7 Threads  1.57 seconds 8 Threads  1.78 secondsp  pThese results were as expected as the times increase just a little probably from context switching between threads and other causes as I add threads, meaning that reads are basically being done in parallel.p  pHowever, when I ran this same test with SQLITEOPENREADWRITE  SQLITEOPENSHAREDCACHE for the flags, I get the following resultsp  p1 Thread  0.67 seconds 2 Threads  2.43 seconds 3 Threads  4.81 seconds 4 Threads  6.60 seconds 5 Threads  8.03 seconds 6 Threads  9.41 seconds 7 Threads  11.17 seconds 8 Threads  12.79 secondsp  pFrom these results, it appears that something in shared cache mode is preventing multiple reads from happening in the database at the same time.  I have verified that indeed different the threads are running in parallel thread 4 reads, thread 8 reads, thread 2 reads, etc. rather than thread 1 performs all its reads, thread 2 performs all its reads, thread 3 performs all its reads, etc..  However, it appears that the reads for each individual transaction are being done in serial, or something else is slowing down the database in shared cache.p  pWhy am I seeing such a high increase in times as I add threads in shared cache mode as opposed to without it  Is there a way to fix this and still use shared cache modep  pThanks for any help.  It is much appreciated.p

Lets call it an eminchem, just for the sake of being able to visualize it.pli lipEvery emempsem element should be as wide as the number of emempem elements in it.  So, an emempsem element with three emempem elements in it would be three inches wide.pli lipEvery emdepem element should be as wide as its emempsem element, or its emdepsem element, whichever is the widest of the two.  So, a emdepem element with a 3inchwide emempsem element and an 8inchwide emdepsem element would be 8 inches wide.  A emdepem element with a 5inchwide emempsem element and a 3inchwide emdepsem element would be 5 inches wide.pli lipEvery emdepsem element should be as wide as the sum of all its emdepem elements widths. So, a emdepsem element with a 3inchwide emdepem, a 5inchwide emdepem, and another 5inchwide emdepem would then be 13 inches wide.pli lipA emdepem or department can have any number of emempem elements or employees and any number of emdepem elements or subdepartments, arbitrarily deep.pli ol  pThe problem, then, that I want to solve in XSLT is how to transform a generic and recursively structured XML Source Document to an XML Result Docment where each or most elements should have some kind of calculated value attached to them that depends on the same or similar calculated value of its children... and so on... and so on... all the way down to whatever might be the leaf node.p  pQuick Edit Thinking about it more, a similar example of this kind of problem would be to transform a filesystem XML Source Document to an XML Result Document in which a filecount attribute is added to every folder showing the total number of files in it and its subfolders, and their subfolders and so on.p  pAny help in learning how to do thisEven...  No. emMost especiallyem if there is more than one idiomatic way to do itwould be deeply appreciated.p

Note that this is a uniprocessor implementation, with SMP disabled which would mandate the use of a hrefhttplxr.freeelectrons.comsourcekerneltimer.cv3.4L1043 relnofollowdeltimersynca instead.p  pThe deltimersync implementation checks if the timer is being handled anywhere right now, but deltimer does not.  On a UP system, is it possible to have the timer being handled without deltimer knowing, i.e. the timer has been removed from the pending timers list and is being handledp
Negative 6367 pIm using the TPL Dataflow library extensively, and really like the UsedBy feature of R. What would be nice is to look at the used by of a method which is the target of an ITargetBlock Action block most likely and return a list of the ITargetBlock.Post calls in addition to any direct method calls. Likewise when you control click go to declaration on ITargetBlock.Post, it should take you directly to the destination method of the action block, not to the definition of the ITargetBlock.p  precodeActionBlockltTgt ab  new ActionBlockltTgtFuncCall, new ExecutionDataflowBlockOptions TaskScheduler  taskScheduler codepre  pSetup the action blockp  precodeab.PostNewVal codepre  pPost a new value to the action block, which will then be passed to the FuncCall method  Control clicking on ab  ab.Post should take you to the method below.p  precodeprivate void FuncCallT parameter      Do work  codepre  pCalling find usages on the above method should take you to ab.PostNewVal, not to the ab definition.p  pIm wondering if there is any way to configure this with resharper.

Negative 6367 pI am using RequireJS and Angular but they are not working together in my set up. Things work fine when jQuery version is 1.7.2. However I wanted to use jQuery 1.8.1 and jQuery UI and angular app even fails to initialize the my main module with this. p  pHere is the problemp  pCase sensitive variables jQuery and jquery. In jquery 1.8.1 source code, towards the end they have defined window.jQuery. Where as in earlier version 1.7.2 had window.jquery defined. p  pSince I want to use jQuery UI in my app included the file jqueryui1.8.23.custom.min.js. After including it I got the error that jQuery is undefined. p  pSo, I decided to upgrade my jQuery version and downloaded the said 1.8.1 version. Towards the end of the jQuery source code I could see that this version defined window.jQuery correct case as needed by jQuery UI.p  pI updated my requirejquery JS with latest version from James Burke github project and updated it with jquery 1.8.1. p  pBut including the updated jQueryRequireJS project, angularjs has stopped working.p  pI get this error in Chrome consolep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comL1Xiw.png altConsole Outputp  pIf I revert to 1.7.2 angular works. Or if I edit jQuery file to define window.jquery instead of window.jQuery note the case it again works. But that means jQuery UI wont.p

I have also a Unit test which creates a temporary dummy user environment and populates it with some files that are used for testing. After this is done I want to clean everything up, thus removing everything from that dummy user directory using codeshutils.rmtreecodep  pI have a dummy class wrapping the original one that prevents it from getting the real user directory and returns the dummy instead. Though Im afraid somebody might forget this and perhaps change it or completely remove the wrapper class. This might work and the developer will end up loosing everything from hisher home directory. Though this might teach himher a good lesson, it is not acceptable.p  pI can check that tmp is at the path start of the user home, so that I know its safe to delete, but that wont work with windows. As tempfile already knows how to create a directory it would be also able to tell if a directory is in the emtemporalem area. Though I cant find out how to do it.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 6367 pIve got a program that keeps securitysensitive information such as private keys in memory, since it uses them over the lifetime of the program.

Negative 6367 pI am wondering if my current approach makes sense or if there is a better way to do it.p  pI have multiple situations where i want to create new objects and let the server assign an ID to those objects. Sending a POST request appears to be the most appropriate way to do that. However since POST is not idempotent the request may get lost and sending it again may create a second object. Also requests being lost might be quite common since the API is often accessed through mobile networks.p  pAs a result i decided to split the whole thing into a twostep process. First sending a POST request to create a new object which returns the URI of the new object in the Location header. Secondly performing an idempotent PUT request to the supplied Location to populate the new object with data. If a new object is not populated within 24 hours the server may delete it through some kind of batch job.p  pDoes that sound reasonable or is there a better approachp  pThanksp

Negative 6367 pThis is my first post, so hello to all of you.  I am an Access developer moving into .Net and I have a WPF project.  Since I am used to subforms in Access, I created user controls to act this way may be an issue itself, but not something I am addressing at the moment.p  pThis particular user control subform has several listboxes that are bound to objects in the code behind VB  I am not getting into that debate either I am familiar with VBA.  These listboxes are bound to a boolean value called IsAssigned.  I created a style to change the items in these listboxes to Greenish or Reddish depending upon that value.  This is working.p  pI then wanted to change the value to override the windows Highlight behavior and learned about the SystemColors.HighlightColor and ControlBrushKey.  The problem is that I want the HighlightColor and ControlBrushKey colors to be dependent upon the IsAssigned value.  I apparently cant nest triggers unless I am missing someting.  In the following code I have the highlight values set to Green just for an illustration of where I am in my understanding of this.p  pSo what I want is that when an item is selected, the text is bolded, with a black border, and maintains a solid color of green or red depending on the IsAssigned value.  When that same item is the highlighted item, I would really like the forecolor to be white and maybe have a thicker border.p  pBe gentle  I am a noob in more ways than one.p  precodeltUserControl.Resourcesgt     ltStyle TargetTypexType ListBoxItem xKeyColorTrueAndFalsegt         ltStyle.Resourcesgt             ltSolidColorBrush xKeyxStatic SystemColors.HighlightColor ColorGreen gt             ltSolidColorBrush xKeyxStatic SystemColors.ControlBrushKey ColorGreen gt         ltStyle.Resourcesgt         ltStyle.Triggersgt             ltTrigger PropertyIsSelected Valuetruegt                 ltSetter PropertyFontWeight ValueBold gt                 ltSetter PropertyBorderBrush ValueBlack gt             ltTriggergt             ltDataTrigger BindingBinding IsAssigned ValueTruegt                 ltSetter PropertyBackgroundgt                     ltSetter.Valuegt                         ltLinearGradientBrush EndPoint1,0.5 StartPoint0,0.5gt                             ltGradientStop ColorLightGreen Offset0 gt                             ltGradientStop ColorGreen Offset1 gt                             ltGradientStop ColorLawnGreen Offset2 gt                         ltLinearGradientBrushgt                     ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltSettergt             ltDataTriggergt             ltDataTrigger BindingBinding IsAssigned ValueFalsegt                 ltSetter PropertyBackgroundgt                     ltSetter.Valuegt                         ltLinearGradientBrush EndPoint1,0.5 StartPoint0,0.5gt                             ltGradientStop ColorLightCoral Offset0.5 gt                             ltGradientStop ColorCoral Offset1 gt                             ltGradientStop ColorRed Offset2 gt                         ltLinearGradientBrushgt                     ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltSettergt             ltDataTriggergt         ltStyle.Triggersgt     ltStylegt ltUserControl.Resourcesgt codepre

Negative 6367 pWhile learning amp experimenting with STL containers I found out that the vector maxsize   4611686018427387903 and deque maxsize  2305843009213693951 on my systemgcc version 4.7.2, x8664. From my limited understanding deques are usually implemented internally as list of vectorsor vector of vectors. If that is the case then why is deques maxsize lesser than that of a vector whichvector would actually require contiguous block of memory and a deque may be able to work with multiple contiguous blocks Does it have anything to do with my system configuration, current state or it is the way it has to be p

Negative 6367 pWhile working on a new version of one of my apps Xcode told me today, that it cannot run the project any more because the development profile has expired.p  pThe organizer shows for strongallstrong development profiles Valid signing identity not found and for strongallstrong distribution profiles Profile has expired. p  pOf course it is not a suprise that profiles expire. In the past all I had to do was a click on Renew but this does not work any more. After entering user name and password for my Account Xcode shows the error message No value was provided for the parameter certificateIds...p  pWhat can I dop  pInstead of using the Organizer the directly visited the Provisioning Center webpage. There are two entries within the section iOS AppsCertificatesAll  1. My Name iOS Development Expires Mar, 17 2012 2. My Name Development Expires Mar, 19 2013p  pA click on one of the certificates show option to Revoke or Download certificate. There is also a  Button to create a new Certificate but the option iOS App Development Sign development versions of your iOS app. is deactivated. p  pIn the section Provision Profiles all development profiles are marked as Active and all distribution profile as Expired. Only Edit and Delete options are available while a Renew option is missing. The Edit option shows the profile details and Generate button. I would assume that Generate creates a new version, but after pressing the button only a progress indicator is shown which comes to no result. After I reload the page the status is unchanged. p  pSo, there are no options to renew the existing certificates and profiles are there. Thus I have to create new certificates but  as described  this option is grayed out. I Assume that I have to delete  revoke the existing certificates first. A click on Revoke shows a very explicit warning strongRevoking this certificate will invalidate it and any related services or provisioning profiles that use this certificate may be affected.strongp  pI am afraid that revoking the certificate might effect my existing app in the App Store  that the app might be removed from sale because the certificate they are based on was deleted.p  pOf course this is a scenario I would like to avoid. Does anyone know strongfor surestrong what happens when using the Revoke option for an existing certificate. Does this even effect App Store appsp  pThank you very muchp

Negative 6367 pIm having a small, but quite irritating issue while using gutterwidths on a masonry layout. Im appending content to a clearing div after every row on a click function, then reloading the masonry to include it in the grid. The small issue is though, that when a div is clicked, it seems to chop off the right of the container for a second or so, which looks like a mistake, it occasionally makes the container jump down.br I noticed when taking the codegutterwidthcode property out of the jquery and replacing it with codemarginleftcode and codemarginrightcode styles this solved the problem, but I preferably need to use gutterwidths as Ill be adding multiple sizes divs including 100 width so I dont want any gaps.brHeres a jsfiddle demo look on the right hand side of the container when a div is clicked a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netSzK5F5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netSzK5F5a br jQueryp  precodedocument.readyfunction        var container  blockwrap      function         container.imagesLoadedfunction             blockwrap.masonry             itemSelector  .contentblocksmall, .contentblockbig, .listingitem, .previewlistingnot.excluded,             columnWidth 3,             gutterWidth 15,             isFitWidth true,             isAnimated true                               document.readyfunction        .listingitem.clickfunction            .listingproperties.hide         var previewForThis  this.nextAll.previewlistingfirst         var otherPreviews  this.siblings.previewlisting.notpreviewForThis         otherPreviews             .addClassexcluded  exclude other previews from masonry layout             .hide         previewForThis             .removeClassexcluded             .appendproperty  this.attrhook.show             .hide             .delay400             .fadeInslow         setTimeoutfunction              html, body.animate scrollTop previewForThis.offset.top20 , slow         , 500         blockwrap.masonryreload        codepre  pIt might be something really obvious that Im missing, or it might not be able to be fixed at all while using the gutter widths hopefully it can but its just a bit irritating.p

Negative 6367 pI simple got a Dialog with a 3 TextBoxes and a ListBox to switch between different input. Looks likep  precodeListBox dropDownPanel TextBox name TextBox msg Button save, cancel codepre  pI call the tuple, Name,msg a profile. so I made changehandler which checks the selected index of the drop down panel  dropDownPanel.getSelectedIndex  and also a handler which checks if the TextBoxes have changed. If there is any change in the boxes, I created a confirmChangeInfoMessageBox with 3 possabilities SAVE, DONT SAVE and CANCLE. The first 2 are no problem because both change to the new index. But how can i get back to the privious index if somebody presses cancel p  pDo I always have to save the privious selected value in the form or is there any different way. p  pthx   p

Negative 6367 pSo I have some files that build up an SEO application MySQL, PHP, JS, Images, etc a mini site and they are in a folder called bodycall. Inside there are the body.php, index.php, cssstyle.css etc.p  pI am working locally on XAMPP and I have buddypress on my site with a theme I bought BuddyBoss.p  pI made a template called keywords.php that has the header and the footer of the BuddyBoss theme but the body  content I left blank and Im trying to call the index.php from the application inside the theme.p  pI tried 2 ways Putting the Application inside the theme parallel with the template keywords. And it didnt show the images, and when I clicked in any link it went to localhostfolderkeywordsindex.php page not found. This would never work since the index folder is the main one, and besides that there is the problem about the URL having the keywords in it.p  pThe second way was putting the application in the root folder, the same problem. Maybe Im calling the files the wrong way.p  pSo basically how do I include the index.php folder from the application inside the keywords template and make the images appear with the forms, the links to work and all the restp  pCan anyone helpp  pThank you so much.  Best, Miguelp  pSO...p  pHere goes part 2p  pHello. Thanks for your effort to help Ill try to explain the situation So I have a mini site a folder with the body.php, the cssstyle.css, the images folder, and so on. Its inside the theme that I bought called buddyboss in the folder bodycall I include the body.php inside keywords.php a template that I made with the center empty. This template is inside Buddyboss. So Buddybosshas inside keywords.php and bodycall folder and boddycall has inside body.php that is called by keywords.php The Template. I include the body.php inside keywords.php as followsp  precodeinclude ..pastatestewpcontentthemesbuddybossbodycallbody.php codepre  ppastateste is the folder inside htdocs from XAMPP that has the site. The code for the images called from inside body.php is as follows, the body.php calls the images like thisp  precodebotaoverde  ltimg srcbodycallimagensbotaoverde.gif width20px height20px gt botaolaranja  ltimg srcbodycallimagensbotaolaranja.gif width20px height20pxgt botaovermelho  ltimg srcbodycallimagensbotaovermelho.gif width20px height20pxgt Etc. codepre  pThe botaoverde, etc. are variables that I use in the php for inserting the respective gif images. BUT THEY DONT SHOW on keywords.php The body file shows more or less ok, but the images are missing and the css file is not working. So It must be the path that is wrong, but I tried all sorts of paths and cant make it work. I really tried a lot of different pathsp  pAnother problem is that I have the page that I called keywords from the template keywords.php and when I click on any of the buttons on the body.php, it goes from  domainkeywords to  domain keywordsindex.php      Page not found. Can you help Miguel PS I havent uploaded the files to the live server. I have been working locally on XAMPP.p

Negative 6367 pIf you have a pivot table set up and you click the drop down for a field, and looking at the value filter section that shows up, I would expect and want this to show up in alphabetical order.  For example, if the field is states, I have pivots where it shows up Missouri, Oklahoma, ... and it makes it hard to find what Im looking for.  Or, imagine a date field where the dates are completely random when you try to filter.p  pI have googled for how to get this list alphabetized and found mostly solutions that are not ideal, i.e., there may not exist any nice way to do this built in to Excel.  I am looking for solutions, especially those involving VBA, because I have many pivot tables, some with many different fields, that I want to fix.  Doing it manually is only an option for a few, if that is the only option.p  pJust to be clear, strongI am not talking about sorting the pivot table itselfstrong.  I know how to do that.  I am talking about sorting the values in the value filter portion of the drop down so that I can easily filter my pivot table down to the specific categories I care about.p  pI am using Excel 2007.p

Negative 6367 pIm using RestKit 0.20.2 in combination with MagicalRecord important for any eventual context problems that you can think of.p  pMy app is a saving ticketsentity with itemsentity and each item has a taxentity. My use case is this  I need to sync core data with my webserver when the ipad reconnects to the internet after a long period of time beeing unable to send the data for whatever reasonp  pMy problem is to be able to sync a lot of objects it can go from 100 to a 1000 to even more, to be able to post a lot of objects without timeouts I set the restkit concurrency p  precode[RKObjectManager sharedManager].operationQueue.maxConcurrentOperationCount  3 codepre  pNow this is working absolutely fine. But my problem is that i have alot of redundant entities that syncs with every item.  For instance each item has a tax, but i only have two taxes in my model that need to be synced with the web service and then sent as a relationship with the item i only put the id of the tax. So to circumvent that problem for each postItem i check if the related Tax has an ID, if yes, then i can parse the item directly with the tax relationship in it, if not, i need to sync the tax first then the item with the returned taxID.p  pThe work around is working as expected too. But again there is a problem, because between each postItem RestKit isnt saving the newly TaxID between two requests, so instead of sending it once, it sends it every time it encounters it inside an item and when all the operations are done it saves the newly created taxIDsp  pTo improve that I digged a bit in restkit and found p  precode voidenqueueBatchOfObjectRequestOperationsNSArray operations                                  progressvoid NSUInteger numberOfFinishedOperations, NSUInteger totalNumberOfOperationsprogress                                completionvoid NSArray operationscompletion codepre  pSo now im building RKManagedObjectRequestOperations for my tax entities and batch them. Then i sync the items. Its more efficient, and i dont need to set a dependency between operations because i need them to be executed in a certain order, tax then items then the whole ticket.p  pstrongPROBLEMstrong Between the two enqueueBatchOperations, RestKit doesnt map the result of the first batch immediately, even if i explicitly callp  precode[[RKManagedObjectStore defaultStore].mainQueueManagedObjectContext saveToPersistentStoreamperror] codepre  pIt isnt mapped because after the first batch of taxes, i send all the items, and i can see that the taxIDs arent set, but after all the batches are done, i can clearly see them mapped correctly in my core data file. So I thought it was a context issue, but when i digg into RestKit and more specifically in p  precodeappropriateObjectRequestOperationWithObjectidobject                                            methodRKRequestMethodmethod                                              pathNSString path                                        parametersNSDictionary parameters codepre  pI can see line 580 p  precodeNSManagedObjectContext managedObjectContext  [object respondsToSelectorselectormanagedObjectContext]  [object managedObjectContext]  self.managedObjectStore.mainQueueManagedObjectContext codepre  pThat sets the mainQueueContext and not the object context for the operations ive checked with breakpoints, so calling save or saveToPersistentStore should propagate the changes from child contexts to the mainQueue and...  its where ive lost hope and turned to stackoverflow p

Negative 6367 pIm trying to render text using SDLttf and openGL.  p  pI open the font and render the text to an SDLSurface and then attached that surface to a texture and bind it for openGL to render it.  p  pI have googled this issue a bunch and not getting many hits which would lead me to believe Im understand something.p  pThe only two functions that matter since Ive pretty much made a temp variable to trouble shoot this issue.  They arep  precodeSDLSurface CFontBlendedUTF8Surface      SDLSurface SurfText     SDLColor Blah     Blah.r  0     Blah.b  255     Blah.g  0     ifSurfText  TTFRenderUTF8BlendedpFont,TxtMsg,Blah          char str[256]         sprintfsstr,  s n, TTFGetError         OutputDebugStringstr          return SurfText   codepre  pThis uses SDLttf to render the text to the SurfText surface. You can see Ive maxed the blue channel.  Ill talk about this in a minute.  Here is the renderingp  precodevoid CLabelOnRenderint xOff,int yOff       ifVisible          glColor4f1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0         Font.ColorFontColors.r, FontColors.g, FontColors.b useless I overwrote the variable with Blah to test this         SDLSurface SurfText          SurfText  Font.BlendedUTF8Surface         TextFont.OnLoadSurfText         TextFont.RenderQuadXxOff,YyOff         SDLFreeSurfaceSurfText         glColor4f0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0       codepre  pAlright, so far from what I can tell, the problem is probably coming from the current color state and the texture environment mode.  p  pWhen I render the text in this fashion, the text will change colors but its like the R and B channels have swtiched.  If I make red 255, the text is blue and if I make blue 255, the text is red.  Green stays green RGB vs BGR .   p  pIf I remove the codeglColor4fcode call in the rendering function, the text refused to render colored at all.  Always black I habitually set the color back to 0,0,0 everytime I render someething, so possible since the mode is modulate R  0  Texture Font R, etc so it will be black.  Makes sense.p  pIf I set the Texture environment to DECAL then the text renders black and a box behind the text renders the color I am trying to render the text.  p  pI think I just dont know the correct way to do this.  Anyone have any experience with SDLttf and openGL texture environments that could give some ideasp  pEditp  pIve done some rewriting of the functions and testing the surface and have finally figured out a few things.  If I use GLDECAL the text renders the correct color and the pixel values value is 0 everywhere on the surface where its not the red color I tried rendering which renders with a value of 255, which is strange since red is the first channel it should have been 2553 or in terms of hex FF0000 at least I would expect.  With DECAL, the alpha space the white space around the text that has 0 for a pixel value shows up the color of the current glColor call.  If I use Blended, the alpha zone disappears but my text renders as blended as well of course so it blends with the underlying background texture.  p  pI guess the more appropriate question is how to I blend only the white space and not the text  My guess is that I could call a new glBlendFunc but I have tested parameters and Im like a child in the woods.  No clue how to get the desired result.p  pSolution isnt completely verified, but the format of the surface is indeed BGRA but I cannot implement this correction.  Im going to attempt to create a color swap function for this I guess.  p  pThis fix did not work.  Instead of setting BGR, I thought just create a new RGB surfacep  precodeif SurfacegtformatgtRmask  0x00ff0000                  Surface  SDLCreateRGBSurfaceFromSurfacegtpixels, Surfacegtw, Surfacegth, 32, Surfacegtpitch, SurfacegtformatgtRmask, SurfacegtformatgtGmask, SurfacegtformatgtBmask, SurfacegtformatgtAmask  codepre  pAfter that failed to work I tried swapping codeSurfacegtformatgtBmaskcode and codeSurfacegtformatgtRmaskcode but that had no effect either.  p

My idea isp  pi creating a stream from tar file in and storing that stream in buffer in order to have its contents then using strstr command to search the html file inside the tar file as i know that in my tar file html contents start from lt doctype html and   ends at  stronglthtmlstrong , so i will load the contents between them which is actally the html file.Is my approach right p  pThe problem is when i give very big size to the buffer but smaller then size of tar file which contains html  many other files also it gives stack over flow on debugging. but when i give small index then it show the contents of some other file which is located in starting if i open tar file in notepadi have checked by opening the tar file in notepad those contents are really present in tar file but at the starting of the tar file so when i increased the index of buffer in order to access the html file which are located at the middle of filewhich actually require very big indexit gives stackoverflow on debugging.

If you do not use new, the fields will remain unassigned and the object cannot be used until all of the fields are initialized.p blockquote  pYou can instantiate a struct without new statement on my pc it works perfectly while on another pc I see compiling errors new required.

Negative 6367 pSimple question, Ive done a decent amount of exploration around custom navigation  transitions between codeUIViewControllercodes and am unclear about the followingp  pIm looking for behavior similar to what codeUIPageViewControllercode provides non stackbased navigation forward and backwards through pages of content. But I want to be able to customize the transitions, and I want the transitions to be interactive linked to a custom codeUIPanGestureRecognizercode. p  pIt seems like the codeUIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioningcode protocol provides some of what I want interactivity, custom transitions. But because transitions are invoked solely with codepresentViewControlleranimatedcode and codedismissViewControllerAnimatedcode it seems like its built exclusively for use with stackbased navigation ie codeUINavigationControllercode, codeUITabBarControllercode, modal presentation. Ie it doesnt seem like itll play nice with something like codeUIPageViewControllercode. p  pIf I use codeUIViewControllercode containment to build a custom container similar to codeUIPageViewControllercode see in progress demo a hrefhttpsgithub.comalfiehansseniosviewcontrollercontainmentherea can I integrate the codeUIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioningcode protocol into this to drive the transitions Or do I need to roll those on my own currently I have a rough manual implementation of interactive transitionsp

Negative 6367 pIm trying to understand how does Office 2013  the part where it draws content to the screen. My findings to farp  ol liOffice is creating a Wic based bitmap, using codeCreateWicBitmapRenderTargetcode.li liUsing this Render Target, Office uses various drawing methods. It wraps those calls with BeginDrawEndDraw as expected.li liOffice uses DrawGlyphRun method to draw the text of the document on the Wic bitmap i.e. the This pointer of DrawGlyphRun is the one returned from CreateWicBitmapRenderTarget.li ol  pAt this point Im confused how Office continue. So my question isp  pstrongWhat are the various possible ways to copy a Wic based Render Target to the screenstrongp  pIm pretty sure that at the end, Office is using a swap chain probably craeted with codeCreateSwapChaincode on Windows 7 and codeCreateSwapChainForHwndcode on Windows 8. Im stepping through various suspicous functions such as codeCreateBitmapFromWicBitmapcode and codeCreateBitmapFromDxgiSurfacecode  but I dont understand the complete chain of API calls.p  pEDIT answer to MooseBoys This is NOT a general question for putting pixels on the screen. The pixels are already on one RenderTarget A render target that was created with CreateWicBitmapRenderTarget, and then has been drawn with BeginDrawDrawGlyphRunEndDraw and I now want to move those pixes to another RenderTarget a render target on the actual screen. On the GDC world, I would look for something like BitBlt, to move pixels from one hdc to another. I wonder what is the protocol in the D2D world.p

Negative 6367 pIm currently building a somewhat basic video timeline. On this timeline are various media assets of variable duration and the width of the DIVs representing the assets reflect the duration, with 1 second being measured as 35px. So, for example, a 5 second asset would take up 175px in width on the timeline.p  pBecause the timeline needs to be longer than the width of my usable space on the page, it needs to scroll horizontally. Instead of using an ugly standard scrollbar, Im using a jQuery plugin scrollbar, which requires that the fullwidth DIV of the timeline sits inside another DIV that is the width of the usable area of the page and acts as a frame, with the inner DIV being absolutely positioned. When you move the scrollbar left or right it changes the left value of the inner DIV.p  pHaving given that context, I now come to my problem. The assets on the timeline need be horizontally resizable to adjust their duration. I have that working using jQuery UI, but I need to make it so that when I drag the right edge of an asset near to the right edge of the outer DIV framing the timeline, the inner DIV of the timeline moves basically scrolls left and the width of the asset increases by 1 second 35px.p  pEven this last bit I have working to a certain degree, but not well enough. What I need is that when I drag far enough to the right, so that Im within 3570 pixels of the right edge of the framing DIV, the inner DIV timeline will move to the left, the width of the asset will increase, and this will keep happening until I move my mouse back towards the left.p  pThe best example I can think of is like when youre selecting text in your browser and you drag past the bottom of the screen, the screen starts scrolling down and it keeps doing that till you move your mouse up.p  pCurrently Im trying to to this by drawing on the resize event of the jQuery UI resizable element, but the problem is that I cant get that continuous effect I was just talking about, I have to keep dragging my mouse further to the right rather than just keeping it still. And when I reach the right edge of the window I have to release the mouse button, move back over to the resizing handle and start dragging again.p  pHeres the function I was trying to write FYI, a .mediaInstance is an asset on the timelinep  precodeScroll Timeline when resized handle comes close to right edge         function timelineScroll               console.logrunning             var mediaElement  mediaTrack .mediaInstance.resizing             var track  horizcontainerinner              Determine location of right edge of the timeline viewport             var timeline  horizcontainerouter             var timelineOffset  timeline.offset             var timelineLeft  timelineOffset.left              var timelineRight  timelineLeft  horizcontainerouter.width              Find right edge of current .mediaInstance             var instanceOffset  mediaElement.offset             var instanceLeft  instanceOffset.left              var instanceRight  instanceLeft  mediaElement.width              if  timelineRightinstanceRight lt 35                    var timelineCurrentLeft  Numbertrack.cssleft.replacepx,                 var timelineNewLeft  timelineCurrentLeft  70                 track.cssleft,timelineNewLeft                  mediaCurrentWidth  mediaElement.width                 mediaElement.widthmediaCurrentWidth35                   if currentMousePos.x gt timelineRight                       while currentMousePos.x gt timelineRight                           var timelineCurrentLeft  Numbertrack.cssleft.replacepx,                         var timelineNewLeft  timelineCurrentLeft  35                         track.cssleft,timelineNewLeft                          mediaCurrentWidth  mediaElement.width                         mediaElement.widthmediaCurrentWidth35                                                                 codepre  pYoull notice I even tried a loop at the end there based on the mouse position being farther right than the right edge of the framing DIV, but I didnt think it would work, and it didnt ... just seemed to put me in an infinite loop.p  pIn any case, Id really appreciate any help anyone can offer on this. Im working on a project with a really short turnaround time and Ive never really done any of this particular stuff before.p

Negative 6367 pI am writing a program that interacts with the LEDs connected on my breadboard that will simulate a ball bouncing up and down. Everything has worked correctly up until the point where the height of the bounce decrements simulating loss of momentum. The LEDs keep lighting on past the 9th LED and start acting bizarre. p  pThe problems arose in this line of codep  precodedigitalWriteledPin[activeLED], HIGH activeLED  dir  if activeLED  bounceLimit    dir  1    bounceLimit    if activeLED  0    dir  1   codepre  pThe activeLED is the LED being lit, they light in succession to the top until it hits the bounceLimit variable, where it changes direction and lights downward until zero and starts upwards again. The problem lies that in the next time it goes up, the bounceLimit should be set lower at 8 then 7, 6, etc. but it seems that it isnt set any lower and the LEDs continue to light to the top and then start to act weird.p  pI managed to fix it by adding another conditionp  precodeif activeLED  bounceLimit ampamp dir  1 dir  1 bounceLimit  codepre  pBut why is the extra condition needed Wouldnt the limit be hit only when the direction is upwards 1 anywaysp

Negative 6367 pIn the following HTML, I want the small delete icon to appear in the upper left corner of its container the div. The larger image a cat needs to be inside of the div and scale so that it does not exceed the height of the div. I need the div to float left because of how its used elsewhere. The delete icon is suppose to overlay on top of the larger image if the larger image fills the width of the div. Please note, that the larger image may actually have a width that is much less than the div and it gets centered in the div. In this case, the delete icon, still is in the upper left corner but is not really overlaying on top of the larger image since the larger image would be too small.

Negative 6367 pCurrently in this iOS application I have added some controller Ive written as an observer to the code[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter]code to observe codeNSUserDefaultsDidChangeNotificationcode.p  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecode voidstartObservingDefaults      [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverself                                              selectorselectoruserDefaultsDidChange                                                  nameNSUserDefaultsDidChangeNotification                                                objectnil]  codepre  pThe user default that I am watching should enable or disable a codeCLLocationManagercode using a codePSToggleSwitchSpecifiercode from the settings menu. After starting the application and sending codestartUpdatingLocationcode to a codeCLLocationManagercode ivar I can go to the settings menu and disable the location manager. My selector codeuserDefaultsDidChangecode will then check if that default is enabled or disabled. If it is enabled, I send codestartUpdatingLocationcode to the location manager instance, if it is disabled I send codestopUpdatingLocationcode to it. Each path logs its action like sop  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecode voiduserDefaultsDidChange      if [self duringOperationHours] ampamp [self isEnabled]          NSLognnnWithin Operating Hours.nnn         [locationManager startUpdatingLocation]         NSLogEnabled Location Manager.      else          NSLognnnDisabled or Outside of Operating Hours.nnn         [locationManager stopUpdatingLocation]         NSLogDisabled Location Manager.       codepre  pI have other settings that control time of day start time and end time ex. 6AM to 6PM. If I change one of those settings and the current time is still within that time range the log will show that it is still Within Operating Hours. and that the location manager is enabled.p  pstrongIfstrong I change it so that the location manager gets disabled, it does log both codeNSLogcode statements in my method above and it strongDOESstrong shut down the location manager.p  pThe problem comes when I try to start it back up. So say I am in the settings and it is enabled. I disable it, the log shows it is disabled and the little icon for GPS disappears, if I then reenable it the notification doesnt fire at all. In fact, no other settings even in other child panes dont fire until I go back to the application. Ive tried a codedispatchasynccode inside the codeuserDefaultsDidChangecode method to both mainqueue and globalqueue and saw no change.p  pstrongMY QUESTION ISstrong am I doing something wrong that might cause this to lock up with the location manager Or is this some internal queue issue to CLLocationManager Or something else Perhaps codeCLLocationManagercode will only start if the application is in the foreground Even if that were the case I emshouldem still be seeing the log statements that it at least emattemptedem to start the location manager rightp

Negative 6367 pI would like to ask if there is a possibility to send raw data to the other application Example taking pictures from a custom camera and send to other application. I observe that using intent is just only sending data which is already saved to storage, but i want that let the 2nd application decided either they save the image or discard. Just like in the tutorial of on how to make custom camera but in that instance, only one application running and only startActivityForResult and the listener which is onResultActivity. In my case, I want that from my custom camera, pass the raw data to the other application and let the other application manage the raw image receive. I call this raw image because this image is in the buffer and not on the storage. Is that possible to pass the raw imagedata to other applicationp

Negative 6367 pI am trying to implement a simple cache where my cache will consist of just a latest token returned by authentication server to my application. There are different worker threads which try to login simultaneously to authentication server.This increases load on authentication server and also my application becomes slow as for each authentication thread there is a round trip involved with the server. Hence by implementing a simple token cache, a token will be cached at client side and will be updated only when one of the authentication thread fails to login. Whoever fails will go and fetch a new token from authentication server.p  pThe problem I am getting is when any authentication thread fails and updates the token cache, there might be some threads who already have read the old token and will fail eventually and they also will try to update the cache. How can I stop these threads from updating the cache once it is already updatedp

Negative 6367 pBefore I go into detail about the troubles that I have been having, let me explain that I am pretty new to android development and I will explain what I am trying to achieve, where I am at so far and the problem that I have encountered. p  pI am developing an android app in version 4.0 using eclipse and what I would like to create is a login page with a username and password which is inputted by a user then checked by an external database to validate and display an alert saying whether the login is successful or not. If it is successful, the app will load a new page with an image obtained from a web source such as this a hrefhttpcommunity.dur.ac.ukcs.seg05WildCameraImagesIMG0364.JPG relnofollowhttpcommunity.dur.ac.ukcs.seg05WildCameraImagesIMG0364.JPGa being displayed on the page. There will be some more information displayed around this page to help a user classify what is in the image and once the user  is finished with this image, they would press a button i have not put this in yet and a new image would pop up and the process repeats.p  pSo far, I have managed to get the  login page working and I can load up a new pageactivity fine with text and default widgets etc and using default images supplied by the android project.

During the OnPaint event of an OpenGLControl, I do the rendering of the corresponding 3D scene. p  pDuring rendering it may happen that I need to wait for another thread to finish.

This is causing problems in my application and I want to disable  prevent  understand the behavior.

Similarly, we can draw length dimension for the rectangle and locate the point x,y for second rectangle. We will use the same height and width for the second rectangle and joining the two rectangles will give the cube.p  pIm trying to do this in C. To do this I need a coordinate of the second rectangle which is at an arbitrary distance say 50 at an angle of 70 degree approx from x, y of first rectanglep

Negative 6367 pIm new to MongoDB and pymongo and looking for some guidance in terms of algorithms and performance for a specific task described below. I have posted a link to an image of the data sample and also my sample python code below. p  pI have a single collection that grows about 5 to 10 Million documents every month. It receives all this info from other systems, which I have no access to modify in any way they are in different companies. Each document represent sort of a financial transaction. I need to group documents that are part of a same transaction group.p  pEach document has hundreds of keys. Almost all keys vary between documents which is why they moved from MySQL to MongoDB  no easy way to align schema. However, I found out that three keys are guaranteed to always be in all of them. Ill call these keys key1, key2 and key3 in this example. These keys are my only option to identify the transactions that are part of the same transaction group. p  pThe basic rule is   If consecutive documents have the same key1, and the same key2, and the same key3, they are all in the same transaction group. Then I must give it some integer id in a new key named transactiongroupid  Else, consecutive documents that do not matck key1, key2 and key3 are all in their own individual transactiongroups.  p  pIts really easy to understand it by looking at the screenshot of a data sample better than my explanation anyway. See herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIvBWH.png altp  pAs you can see in the sample  Documents 1 and 2 are in the same group, because they match key1, key2 and key3  Documents 3 and 4 also match and are in their own group  Following the same logic, documents 18 and 19 are a group obviously. However, even though they match the values of documents 1 and 3, they are not in the same group because the documents are not consecutive.p  pI created a very simplified version of the current python function, to give you guys an idea of the current implementationp  precodedef groupTransactionsmongohost,                       mongoport,                       mongodb,                       mongocollection   Group transactions if Keys 1, 2 and 3 all match in consecutive docs.       mc  MongoClientmongohost, mongoport     db  mc[testdb]     coll  db[testcollection]       The first document transaction group must always be equal to 1.     firstdocid  coll.findone[id]     coll.updateid firstdocid,                 set transactiongroupid 1,                 upsertFalse, multiFalse       Cursor order is undetermined unless we use sort, no matter what the id is. We learned it the hard way.     cur  coll.find.sortsubtransactionid, ASCENDING     doccount  cur.count      uniquedata  []     uniquedata.appendcur[0][key1], cur[0][key2], cur[0][key3]     transactiongroupid  1     i  1      while i lt doccount          docid  cur[i][id]         uniquedata.appendcur[i][key1], cur[i][key2], cur[i][key3]          if uniquedata[i]  uniquedata[i1]              New group find, increase group id by 1             transactiongroupid  transactiongroupid  1           Update the group id in the database         coll.updateid docid,                     set transactiongroupid transactiongroupid,                     upsertFalse, multiFalse          i  i  1      print d subtransactions were grouped into d transaction groups.  doccount, i     return 1 codepre  pThis is the code, more or less, and it works. But it takes between 2 to 3 days to finish, which is starting to become unacceptable. The hardware is good VMs in last generation Xeon, local MongoDB in SSD, 128GB RAM. It will probably run fast if we decide to run it on AWS, use threadingsubprocesses, etc  which are all obviously good options to try at some point. p  pHowever, Im not convinced this is the best algorithm. Its just the best I could come up with.There must be obvious ways to improve it that Im not seeing.p  pMoving to cc or out of NoSQL is out of the question at this point. I have to make it work the way it is. p  pSo basically the question is Is this the best possible algorithm using MongoDBpymongo in terms of speed If not, Id appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction.p  pstrongEDITstrong Just so you can have an idea of how slow this code performance is Last time I measured it, it took strong22 hoursstrong to run on 1.000.000 results. As a quick workaround, I wrote something else to load the data to a Pandas DataFrame first and then apply the same logic of this code more or less. It took strong3 to 4 minutesstrong to group everything, using the same hardware. I mean, I know Pandas is efficient, etc. But theres something wrong, there cant be such a huge gap between between the two solutions performances 4min vs 1,320min.p

Negative 6367 pIm trying to set up a TCP server in a Chrome app. Im very close to being done. I can send data from my TCP server to my client. But I cant process the data sent BY the client. I figured out that the socket is paused. The thing is, I cant seem to unpause it.p  pIf I try this in the JavaScript consolep  precodechrome.sockets.tcp.getSocketsfunctiond console.logd codepre  pI get this resultp  precode[Object]   0 Object     connected true     localAddress 127.0.0.1     localPort 60519     paused true     peerAddress 127.0.0.1     peerPort 36529     persistent false     socketId 11     length 1 codepre  pSo then I just unpause it, right Like thisp  precodechrome.sockets.tcpServer.setPaused   socketID, false, function       console.logunpaused      codepre  pAnd indeed my callback is runp  precodeunpaused codepre  pBut if I check againp  precodechrome.sockets.tcp.getSocketsfunctiond console.logd codepre  pI emstillem getp  precode[Object]   0 Object     connected true     localAddress 127.0.0.1     localPort 60519     paused true     peerAddress 127.0.0.1     peerPort 36529     persistent false     socketId 11     length 1 codepre  pFor the socketID value in the call to setPaused, Ive used both the value Chrome gave me for socketID and for clientSocketID. Neither one seems to unpause my socket.p  pEDITp  pI also tried getInfop  precodechrome.sockets.tcpServer.getInfo19, function d console.logd codepre  pwhich returned, to my great surprisep  precodeObject    localAddress 127.0.0.1,   localPort 60519,   paused false,   persistent false,   socketId 19  codepre  pgetSockets still says that the socket is paused. The socket is still not receiving messages. Im very confused.p  pFor the sake of completeness, heres how Im trying to process messagesp  precodePackage.MyClass.prototype.onAccept  functioninfo    console.logaccept info, info   if info.socketId  this.serverSocketId  return   console.logSocket ID is correct.  This gets printed every time.     Start receiving data.   chrome.sockets.tcp.onReceive.addListenerthis.onReceive.bindthis   chrome.sockets.tcpServer.setPausedthis.serverSocketId, false  codepre  pI can tell that onAccept is called when the client connects to the socket the console log shows that. But onReceive also starts with a call to console.log and that never shows up.p  pEDIT SOLVEDp  pI found a workaround I used this script instead a hrefhttpsgithub.comGoogleChromechromeappsamplesblobmastertcpservertcpserver.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.comGoogleChromechromeappsamplesblobmastertcpservertcpserver.jsap  pIt does everything I need and its much easier to use and configure.p
Negative 6367 pI use a hrefhttpsgithub.comFriendsOfSymfonyFOSUserBundle relnofollowFriendsOfSymfony UserBundlea. It works when I set everything in firewall as codeformlogincode, but if I set it to codesimpleformcode to use a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentcookbooksecuritycustompasswordauthenticator.html relnofollowCustom Authenticatora then it lets me login even if the account is locked or disabled. I want to check if the user comes from the correct IP, thats why I created the custom authenticator, but it seems that some authentication coming from FOS is not processed this way. How can I use codesimpleformcode with custom authenticator while still keeping full functionality of FOS UserBundlep  pIs there some other way I can achieve some other authentication than just the standard Maybe Im doing something wrong I know I can correct this code of my authenticator to check for lockedenabled etc, but I figured  since its actually already done in FOS  why should Ip  pstrongEDITstrong Also, I noticed that when I use codesimpleformcode the methods of class codeSymfonyComponentSecurityCoreUserUserCheckercode arent being called.p  pBelow is my code of authenticator and codesecurity.ymlcodep  pstrongconfig.ymlstrongp  precodeservices     loginauthenticator         class     ForexAlchemyBundleSecurityLoginAuthenticator         arguments [security.encoderfactory] codepre  pstrongsecurity.ymlstrongp  precodesecurity     encoders         FOSUserBundleModelUserInterface sha512      rolehierarchy         ROLEADMIN       ROLEUSER         ROLESUPERADMIN ROLEADMIN      providers         fosuserbundle             id fosuser.userprovider.usernameemail      firewalls         main             pattern              simpleform                 authenticator loginauthenticator                 provider fosuserbundle                 csrfprovider form.csrfprovider             logout       true             anonymous    true      accesscontrol           path register, role ISAUTHENTICATEDANONYMOUSLY   To be removed           path login, role ISAUTHENTICATEDANONYMOUSLY            path resetting, role ISAUTHENTICATEDANONYMOUSLY            path admin, role ROLEADMIN            path ., roles ROLEUSER  codepre  pstrongLoginAuthenticatorstrongp  precodeltphp  namespace ForexAlchemyBundleSecurity  use SymfonyComponentHttpFoundationRequest use SymfonyComponentSecurityCoreAuthenticationSimpleFormAuthenticatorInterface use SymfonyComponentSecurityCoreAuthenticationTokenTokenInterface use SymfonyComponentSecurityCoreAuthenticationTokenUsernamePasswordToken use SymfonyComponentSecurityCoreEncoderEncoderFactoryInterface use SymfonyComponentSecurityCoreExceptionAuthenticationException use SymfonyComponentSecurityCoreExceptionUsernameNotFoundException use SymfonyComponentSecurityCoreUserUserProviderInterface  class LoginAuthenticator implements SimpleFormAuthenticatorInterface      private encoderFactory      public function constructEncoderFactoryInterface encoderFactory              thisgtencoderFactory  encoderFactory           public function authenticateTokenTokenInterface token, UserProviderInterface userProvider, providerKey              try              user  userProvidergtloadUserByUsernametokengtgetUsername          catch UsernameNotFoundException e              throw new AuthenticationExceptionInvalid username or password                   encoder  thisgtencoderFactorygtgetEncoderuser         passwordValid  encodergtisPasswordValid             usergtgetPassword,             tokengtgetCredentials,             usergtgetSalt                   if passwordValid               request  RequestcreateFromGlobals              currentip  requestgtservergtgetREMOTEADDR              usergtsetLoggedIPcurrentip              if usergtisValidIP                  throw new AuthenticationException                     You cannot login from your location.,                     100                                            return new UsernamePasswordToken                 user,                 usergtgetPassword,                 providerKey,                 usergtgetRoles                       else               TODO Check if there werent too many tries to login                   throw new AuthenticationExceptionInvalid username or password           public function supportsTokenTokenInterface token, providerKey              return token instanceof UsernamePasswordToken             ampamp tokengtgetProviderKey  providerKey           public function createTokenRequest request, username, password, providerKey              return new UsernamePasswordTokenusername, password, providerKey        codepre
Negative 6367 pI am trying to align a UILabel or a NSAttributedString within a UILabel so that a specified character is always aligned to the center of the screen.p  pOne way to do it is to use two labels. One for the specified character and the substring from the left and make it rightaligned. The second for the substring right of the specified character.p  pI was wondering is there a way to simplify the process now with the almighty NSAttributedString. Or maybe with a NSDateFormatter.p  pstrongSample usagestrong Set the  in the time format e.g. 1240, 914, 304 PM to always be centred to the screen or to anything else.

Im calling it in the following wayp  precodevar dataset      d3.tsvST03data.tsv, functiondata         datasetdata    codepre  pand then I do a whole bunch of things like drawing a graph or whatever and its fine. Id like to use some, but not all, of the columns of data in a certain way, so what Id like to do is set them up as a variable. So what Ive done, straight away underneath the code above is writep  precodevar newvar  d.data1, d.data3, d.data5 codepre  pwhere data1, data3 and data5 are columns of data.  get the error message Cant find variable d. If if use data1, data3, data5 instead that is, dropping the d. I get an equivalent message. p  pSo whats going wrong Do I need to build a function Ive sort of tried and that hasnt worked either but  can see how it might be better. All help appreciated. Thanks.p  pTheres a full example here a hrefhttpwww.graphitti.orgadmin2filesexperimentsclickcounter3.html relnofollowhttpwww.graphitti.orgadmin2filesexperimentsclickcounter3.htmla It looks like it works and it does up to a point but I want to make it easier. At the moment, there are two clicks, and clicking them passes new data in. It does so using variables I have set up in each click, in fact in the attributes for the rectangles. What I want to do is move that variable called barup at the moment to the top of the code so I dont need to repeat it. p
Negative 6367 pThe application I am working on is going to have a multithreaded TCP server process say Receiver and a separate process running persistent TCP client say Dispatcher. The worker threads of the Receiver would read async messages sent by multiple clients and then forward it to the Dispatcher which will finally send it to the dispatch server. p  precode        Receiver                                 Dispatcher [sock1]ltgt[Worker1]              [sock2]ltgt[Worker2] gt  FIFO  gt  [persistent socket] gt [sock3]ltgt[Worker3]  codepre  pThe worker thread waits fro response after writing the message in FIFO. Dispatcher gets a response for every message and must deliver it back to the worker. p  precode           Receiver                                      Dispatcher [sock1]ltgt[Worker1] lt             [sock2]ltgt[Worker2] lt Wake up the worker using                             Msg IDgtWorker ID map   lt[persistent socket]lt [sock3]ltgt[Worker3] lt codepre  pI am planning to keep a hashmap of worker id and message id so that the response could be delivered to the specific worker.brbrSo effectively I am using two different mechanism to sendreceive the data between worker threads and the dispatcher. I am not very convinced that this is the best way to handle the two way async communication needed here. I dont want to use shared memory as that would bring a lot of synchronization issues given that a large number of concurrent worker threads might do async IO. Please suggest whether this design FIFOhashmap is suitable and good enough, or if you have any other design suggestions for this use casep

Negative 6367 pI am working with low resolution VGA and jpgcompressed sequences of images for visual navigation on a mobile robot. At the moment I am using SURF for detecting keypoints and extracting descriptors out of the images, and FLANN for tracking them.

Negative 6367 pIm developing a CRUD project using ASP.NET MVC 4. There is a requirement to implement an autocomplete on search form text fields.

Negative 6367 pI have a lot of localized texts written in my Localizable.strings file, and I am looking for a way to  use these and get them shown in the interface builder. That is, instead of creating outlets for all my views and setting the text in code, I would like to make an codeIBDESIGNABLEcode UILabel subclass, which must access my Localizable.strings file and then show the localized text directly on the interface builder. p  pThe problem is, that NSLocalizedString does not give any results in interface builder, but only when I actually emrunem the code. Is there a way to tell the interface builder which file to use for localization for example in prepareForInterfaceBuilderp

When I call iomappingcreatewc function, it creates a mapping of WC writecombine in page table, which I presume that WC property is available in PAT Page Attribute Table. But, after calling this function, it calls archphyswcadd, which is basically adding the WC property into PAT. p  pSo, my question is should I call archphyswcadd first and then call iomappingcreatewcp  pBut, this code looks working fine, and I guess there is something that Im missing.

Negative 6367 pI am using The Amazing Audio EngineCore Audio to generate the sound. Thread synchronization is difficult. I need some helps. p  pIn my view controller, it have a start button and stop button.The start button is running a block which will create a sound in a thread. A stop button mutes the sound, but it does not stop the thread or block. If I pressed the start button, it always generates a new thread. What can I do to only allow one thread is generated. In other word, how can I kill the block or thread when the user presses the stop button.p  pThanks,p

Negative 6367 pIm very new to Swing, and Im having a lot of trouble understanding it.p  pIm building a game that when a button is clicked, the players sprite will move randomly within one square from its location.

Negative 6367 pIm not sure if Im just not seeing a blatant answer of if Ive been wrong about an important part of this programming language this whole time.p  pIn short, Ive got code that contains an array of doubles called buckets. My code needs to parse this array indexbyindex, check its value, and store in a new array called finalVals the last 5 values. The buckets array will contain about 100 values, most of which are zeros and are not needed. A sequence of 5 consecutive zeros will imply the end of the data that I need. So I need to return the last 5 values in buckets where the values are all nonzeros. This is stored in the array called nonZeros.p  precodelastVal  new double[5]  A global variable already declared but not set double nonZeros[]  new double[5]  A local variable int numberOfZeros  0 for int i  0 i lt buckets.length i      double val  buckets[i]     if val  0          System.out.printlnEncountered a zero.         numberOfZeros         lastVal[0]  lastVal[1]         lastVal[1]  lastVal[2]         lastVal[2]  lastVal[3]         lastVal[3]  lastVal[4]         lastVal[4]  val          else if val  0          System.out.printlnDid not encounter a zero.         numberOfZeros  0         lastVal[0]  lastVal[1]         lastVal[1]  lastVal[2]         lastVal[2]  lastVal[3]         lastVal[3]  lastVal[4]         lastVal[4]  val         nonZeros  lastVal  This is where the problem was          prettyPrintArrayslastVal,nonZeros     if numberOfZeros  5  break   return nonZeros codepre  pThe problem was in the last set. The if conditions do indeed properly detect whether or not val was 0 or really 0.0. And keeping the last 5 values in lastVal works. However, when that nonworking line is executed, the code behaves as if nonZeros became a pointer that simply pointed to lastVal. The nonZeros array ALWAYS stored the same values as lastVal from there on out, even when zeros were encountered in val. It was my understanding that these variables are independent. So I was expecting nonZeros to only hold the same values as lastVal in cases when we encountered a nonzero. And the function would always just return the last 5 values of buckets before 5 consecutive zeros were encountered.p  pThe solution was to replace that problematic line with code that sets the contents of nonZeros individually just as I did for lastVal. So am I missing something obvious in my code here that is always setting nonZeros to lastVal Or am I misunderstanding what nonZeros  lastVal actually doesp

In addition there are descriptive keys and values contained in the datakey and datavalue pairs.p  pI need to consolidate a set of these datakeys into my resulting class so that the class will end up like thisp  precodecase class Tab  tableKey String, description String, valA String, valB String, valC String  object Tab   val simple     get[String]tablekey    get[String]description    get[String]vala    get[String]valb    get[String]valc map    case tableKey  description  valA  valB  valC gt Tabtablekey, description, valA, valB, valC       def listtabKey String  List[Tab]     DB.withConnection  implicit connection gt    val tabs  SQL              SELECT DISTINCT p.tablekey, p.description,           a.datavalue vala,           b.datavalue valb,           c.datavalue valc         FROM demodata p              JOIN demodata a on p.tablekey  a.tablekey and a.datakey  A              JOIN demodata b on p.tablekey  b.tablekey and b.datakey  B              JOIN demodata c on p.tablekey  c.tablekey and c.datakey  C         WHERE p.tablekey  tabKey             .ontabKey gt tabKey.asTab.simple        return tabs    codepre  pwhich will return what I want, however I have more than 30 data keys that I wish to retrieve in this manner, and the joins to itself rapidly becomes unmanageable.  As in the query ran for 1.5 hours and used up 20GB worth of temporary tablespace before running out of disk space.p  pSo instead I am doing a separate class that retrieves a list of data keys and data values for a given table key using the where datakey in A,B,C,..., and now Id like to flatten the returned list into a resulting object that will have the valA, valB, valC, ... in it.  I still want to return a list of the flattened objects to the calling routine.p  pLet me try to idealize what Id like to accomplish..p  pTake a header result set and a detail result set, extract out the keys out of the detail result set to populate additional elementsproperties in the header result set and produce a list of classes containing the all the elements of the header result set, and the selected properties from the detail result set.  So I get a list of TabHeadertabKey,Desc and for each I retrieve a list of interesting TabDetailDataKey,DataValue, I then extract out the element where the DataKey  A and put the DataValue element in TabvalA, and do the same for DataKey  B, C, ...  After Im done I wish to produce a TabtabKey, Desc, valA, valB, valC, ... in place of the corresponding TabHeader.  I could quite possibly muddle through this in Java, but Im treating this as a learning opportunity and would like to know a good way to do this in Scala.p  pIm feeling that something with the scala mapping should do what I need, but I havent been able to track down exactly what.p

The variables var1, var2.....etc are basically text data and are  overflowing to next rows depending on the number of characters in that particular variable. There is no particular pattern to how many rows the are overflowing to. The next subjects data is starting after the last observation of previous subject.  Because of this variability, the csv file has more than three thousand rows even though the number of subjects are around 100.  There is now way to concatenate the rows in the original database.  Can anyone suggest a way get all the records in a single row with each variablesdata I am regular visitor to stackoverflow for R related issues and so far found solutions to every other issue I had and this is the first time I got stuck. Looks like a unique problem Thanks in advance Rajp  pEdit There are no rows which are completely empty all the way. I could not post image of the files as I dont have enough reputation  The data I have posted is of 4 subjects only but as you can see it runs into 17 rows both in csv and after reading into R. as I tried explained in original post var1 ......var6 are text type of data and for some reason after it maxes out it overflows to next row in csv with empty values for ID and other varn which have shorter texts. The next subjects record starts after the last row of longest varn. I hope that explains the prboblem Thanksp

Negative 6367 pFirst of all to clarify the type of tests I am attempting to run as people refer to these in different ways. These are to test the end to end work flow of a system in a fully deployed environment, so integration tests, but going a step further by testing a full userprocess journey for regression test purposes as opposed just 2 maybe 3 components.p  pAn example of a process I am testingp  blockquote   ol   liA record is updated in a database tableli   liA process is scanning said table for updates e.g. time stamp changeli   liProcess picks up update and pops this message on an MSMQli   liProcess picks up message off the queue and attempts to push to another data storeli   liI now assert that the updated record is now reflected in the other data store defined in step 4.li   ol blockquote  pNow in the above test scenario there are few time consumingdependant processes happening steps 2 and 4 mainly which I dont want to have to add waits in or hold up threads waiting for the full stack to complete. p  blockquote   pThe end result I want to get to is trigger step 1 and assert step 5.p blockquote  pI can see the option of simplifying the test so that you are only testing 2 interacting components at a time. However, if you have a suite of regression tests, it is going to be extremely difficult to stop and start services without affecting other tests.p  pAnother option could be, dont bother and just manual test. I dont feel this is acceptable when trying to regression test a full system and trying to reduce time to release new features, bug fixes etc.p  blockquote   pSo my question is what do other people dowhat have people found to be the best approach to tackle this problemp blockquote  pI appreciate that this question may not be seen as a constructive question with a definitive answer, but I hope other peoples shared experience may help me as well as others facing the same problem.p  pFYI, an approach I am trying at the moment is to have 3 separate builds I am using TFS, .NET. These three builds loosely represent the Given, When, Then testing approach, where p  precodeGiven  sets up data When  represent my action e.g. step 1 above Then  carry out assertions e.g. step 5 above codepre  pI then set up these 3 builds to be kicked off at specified times over night for example.p  pThanksp  pDanp

Negative 6367 pRecently we have upgraded the SQL server from 2008 r2 to 2014 .  Also we have upgraded the reports from SSRS 2008 to SSRS 2012.  After upgradation the reports are taking a lot of time to render. Previously reports were taking 3 seconds to render and display, but the same reports in SSRS 2012 are taking 20 seconds. I have found that if remove SSRS expressions for displaying    instead of NULL it is taking 10 seconds to run and display. Instead of expressions i have used VB code but there is no change.

Negative 6367 pI have a large set of 2dimensional points and want to be able to rapidly query the set for the kNearestNeighbours of any point in the 2d space. Since its lowdimensional, a KDTree seems like a good way to go about it. My initial data set will only be updated very rarely, so the time to query a point should be more important to me than the buildtime. However, each time I run the program I will need to reload the object, so I also need a structure that can be saved and reloaded swiftly.p  pThe two choices readily available are the KDTree structures in SciPy and in SciKitlearn. Below I profile the two of these for buildspeed and queryspeed across a large range of list lengths. I also pickle the SciKitlearn structure and show the time to reload the object from the pickle. These are compared in a graph, and the code used to generate the timings is included below.p  pAs I show in the graph, loading from a pickle is faster than building it from scratch by half an order of magnitude for large N, showing that the KDTree is suitable for my use case ie. frequent reloads but infrequent rebuilds.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYFDJj.png altComparing build, reload and querytime of two KDTree structuresp  pCode to compare buildtimesp  precode Profiling the building time for the two KDtree structures and reloading from a pickle import math, timeit, pickle, sklearn.neighbors  thelengths  [100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000]  theSciPyBuildTime  [] theSklBuildTime  [] theRebuildTime  []  for length in thelengths     dim  5intmath.sqrtlength     nTimes  50     from random import randint     listOfRandom2DPoints  [ [randint0,dim,randint0,dim] for x in rangelength]      setup  import scipy.spatial import sklearn.neighbors length    strlength   dim    strdim   from random import randint listOfRandom2DPoints  [ [randint0,dim,randint0,dim] for x in rangelength]      theSciPyBuildTime.append timeit.timeitscipy.spatial.KDTreelistOfRandom2DPoints, leafsize20, setupsetup, numbernTimesnTimes      theSklBuildTime.append timeit.timeitsklearn.neighbors.KDTreelistOfRandom2DPoints, leafsize20, setupsetup, numbernTimesnTimes       theTreeSkl  sklearn.neighbors.KDTreelistOfRandom2DPoints, leafsize20, metriceuclidean     f  opentemp.pkl,w     temp  pickle.dumpstheTreeSkl      theRebuildTime.append timeit.timeitpickle.loadstemp, from main import pickle,temp, numbernTimesnTimes  codepre  pCode to compare querytimesp  precode Profiling the query time for the two KDtree structures import scipy.spatial, sklearn.neighbors  thelengths  [100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000]  theSciPyQueryTime  [] theSklQueryTime  []  for length in thelengths     dim  5intmath.sqrtlength     nTimes  50     listOfRandom2DPoints  [ [randint0,dim,randint0,dim] for x in rangelength]      setup  from main import sciPiTree,sklTree from random import randint length    strlength   randPoint  [randint0,  strdim  ,randint0,  strdim  ]       sciPiTree  scipy.spatial.KDTreelistOfRandom2DPoints, leafsize20     sklTree  sklearn.neighbors.KDTreelistOfRandom2DPoints, leafsize20      theSciPyQueryTime.append timeit.timeitsciPiTree.queryrandPoint,10, setupsetup, numbernTimesnTimes      theSklQueryTime.append timeit.timeitsklTree.queryrandPoint,10, setupsetup, numbernTimesnTimes  codepre  pnbspp  pQuestionsp  ol lipstrongThe Resultstrong Although theyre getting closer for very large N, SciKitlearn seems to beat SciPy for both build time and query time.

Negative 6367 pI am wondering if a ruby hash can be shared between Sass and CoffeeScript with a minimum of fuss.p  pIve looked around for an answer to this but found nothing conclusive. Sources, such as the a hrefhttpsasslang.comdocumentationfile.SASSREFERENCE.htmlimportdocumentationa for a hrefhttpsasslang.comdocumentationfile.SASSREFERENCE.htmldatatypessassa, talk about how to link files of the same type and how to manipulate data structures within the language, but dont touch on whether data can be imported from elsewhere, or whether ruby code can be interpreted in someway  the only similar thing I can think of is compass using a .rb file for its config.p  pMy instinct suggests this is or should be possible, both languages are Rubylike and capable of interpreting hashes.p  pAs this is a practical problem Ive faced several times DRYing up preprocessed front end code, but also providing the same values for backend processing, such as generating an SVG in an HTML template but never solved in a really clean way I would accept a solution that involved using Rails.p  pPlease note, I am quite specific about this relating to the emprecompilation stageem of front end asset production, namely emsassem and emcoffeescriptem. Answers which involve css, javascript or require a browser are not what Im looking for.p  pstrongExtra bitsstrongp  pIve decided to add an example, here are three definitions of the same data as key value pairsp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16318912whatstheproperhashsyntaxinruby20Rubyap  precodecolours   brandBackground f00, brandForeground 00f, brandText 0f0  colours[brandBackground] codepre  pa hrefhttpsasslang.comdocumentationfile.SASSREFERENCE.htmlmapsSass Mapap  precodecolours  brandBackground f00, brandForeground 00f, brandText 0f0  mapgetcolours, brandBackground codepre  pa hrefhttpcoffeescript.orgliteralsCoffeeScriptap  precodecolours   brandBackground f00, brandForeground 00f, brandText 0f0  colours.brandBackground codepre  pCoffeescript and Ruby hash definitions are identical, Sass is very close ... if this can work then colours or any other variable could be defined in one place then used throughout the front and back end by any code.p

Negative 6367 pIm trying to understand some of the differences between ForkJoinPool and ThreadPoolExecutor, and the following caught my attention.p  pstrongWith ThreadPoolExecutorstrongp  precodepublic static void mainString[] args      ExecutorService es  Executors.newCachedThreadPool     es.execute gt System.out.printlnHello.     es.shutdown  codepre  pThis program will strongalwaysstrong print out Hello. to the screen.p  pstrongWith ForkJoinPoolstrongp  precodepublic static void mainString[] args      ForkJoinPool es  new ForkJoinPool1     es.execute gt System.out.printlnHello.     es.shutdown  codepre  pThis program will strongon occasionstrong print out Hello. to the screen.p  pWhats going on herep  pNote that if I take out the call to gracefully shutdown, the first program never terminates, but both otherwise behave the same.p  pI understand that the forkjoin behavior is explainable by noting that the JVM simply doesnt wait for the executed thread to terminate, and sometimes the thread is lucky enough to run before main finishes. Why isnt this same behavior exhibited by the first solutionp  pI dont think the answer is that both actually behave the same and Im just getting lucky when I run the first solution. Indeed, when I run the first solution 100 times, I get Hello. all 100 times, but when I run the second 100 times, I get Hello. roughly 10 times. Even if the word always is not precisely correct, it appears that there is a key difference between how the two work that is causing the apparently different behavior.p

Negative 6367 pI have a POJO with a field marked as transient. GSON does not serialize it. Great. But when it is deserialized it wipes out the the fields initial settings.p  pFor example, if I have this objectp  precodepublic class ObjWithTransient      public String name     public transient ListltStringgt listOStrings  new ArrayList  codepre  pAnd I run this testp  precodeTest public void testSerializeWithTransient throws Exception      ObjWithTransient obj  new ObjWithTransient     obj.name  Foobar     String json  gson.toJsonobj       Deserialize     ObjWithTransient obj2  GsonUtil.gson.fromJsonjson, ObjWithTransient.class     Assert.assertEqualsobj2.name, Foobar     Assert.assertNotNullobj2.listOStrings   lt Fails here     Assert.assertEqualsobj2.listOStrings.size, 0  codepre  pBy marking it transient, I assume I am telling GSON to ignore it, but that doesnt seem to be the case. What is the best way to retain the initial settings herep  pEDIT I believe the issue is because there is not a declared constructor. This does not work with an inner class, but with a normal  class or a static inner class it appears to work. Reading the GSON code, it trys multiple ways to create the object, but ultimately uses a UnsafeConstructor to create it if nothing else works. This creates an object with null entries across the board. I could also add an InstanceCreator to tell Gson how to create the object.p

For this reason I have been attempting to use QLibrary but keep getting Segmentation faults when I try to call SUBROUTINES defined in my DLL with resolvemyfunctionp  pI have defined my external subroutine as just a simple test at this stage, not actually important for what I wanted to do Although the actual code I need to access is much more complicated baby steps, I wrote a simple subroutine to return the square of an integerp  precodeSUBROUTINE SQa,asquare DEC ATTRIBUTES C, REFERENCE, MIXEDSTRLENARG, DLLEXPORT, ALIASSQ  SQ   integer, intentin   a              input   integer, intentout  asquare        output   asquare  a2 END SUBROUTINE SQ  codepre  pI import the library and call it within Qt withp  precodetypedef int MyPrototypeint i     MyPrototype Square  MyPrototype FAST.resolveSQ     int K  4     int J  SquareK codepre  pThis results in a segregation errorp  p3 Is there any way to check if the library has, in fact, loaded Of course calling a subroutine would accomplish this, but that isnt working, and when I import the library DLLname.load returns a positive result. and resolve.subname has a memoryaddress allocated to it. Does this suggest a type fault Ie. passing the wrong identifier in to the fortran code.p  pOnce again, thanks for reading and please feel free to take apart any flaws in logic I have, Im not a programmerp

Negative 6367 pI have a problem while trying to commit and sometimes a comment have slightly changed in some way eg different number of spaces like code Textcode compared codeTextcode. This is annoying and I would like to know if there is a way to make git ignore commented lines. Since git may be unaware of file type, language and so on, I guess I could restrict myself to ignore changes in lines containing codecode. My guess is that I could add some kind of rule for diff to ignore this, but there is another problem as well. How do I make git understand that these lines are supposed to be ignored in a comparison and still included in the repop  pstrongEDITstrong As far as I know, this was done in svn. They had some smart implementation for this. My question is if there are something similar for git.p

Negative 6367 pBeen working on this all day and its driving me crazy.  Im new to SSIS usually a C programmer so things dont work the way Id expect them to p  ptldr  how can I use an ADO ForEach Enumerator and pass the whole row as variable to the Data Task which holds a Script component insidep  pScenario I am using a CDC Splitter component in a Data Task to retrieve and split out INSERTS, UPDATES and DELETES from the CDC tables within my database.  I assign each change to a package level Object variable which is a recordset.p  pTaking just the INSERTS object variable I want to check for a condition on the provided string data, and if its true I want to email the change to someone.  p  pTo achieve this I dropped a ForEach container on the surface and hooked it up to the INSERTS Object variable.  Then inside that container I dropped a Data Flow Task, and then within that Data Flow Task I dropped a Script Component.  p  pThe idea is if some condition is met for the current row, the row will be added to the Script Components Output buffer.  Whats bugging me is that it seems as though the only way to achieve this is to map each column in the row to the ForEach loops variables collection.  Every example Ive seen shows variables mapped starting with Index 0 etc.  However my row has a lot of columns and I dont want to create variables for every column, it seems wrong to do it this way.p  pSo the question is.. within the ADO Enumerator ForEach container, how do I pass the current row all the columns to the Data Task inside and in turn the Script Task within the Data Task p  pThanks for any advice...p
Negative 6367 pI have a problem with my Test Plan. If I add User Defined Variable, lets say csrftoken and assign NOTINITIALIZED to it in User Defined Variables config element, it is passed to http request where it is referenced, but not set in prior http request sampler that has a regular expression extractor child element, that is supposed to set it, which means it is passed as NOTINITIALIZED. If I dont use User Defined Variables config element to declare it, I cannot reference it in later http request, that is, it stays like csrftoken, although it should be setcreated by previous http request and its post processing regexp Extractor, since it properly references the name. I think, there might be some problem with the scope, but I cant figure what. Everything is within the same Transaction Controller, nothing changes if I place everything directly at the Thread Group level. What am I missing Thanks in advance.p

Negative 6367 pI have a newly built MVC 5 app, using the default template, codePayCaddy.Clientcode. As built, without any mods, the project creates its own data model, covering entities like codeApplicationUsercode for authentication. I like this, just create the project, and its ready for me to do my own stuff and not worry too much about authentication.p  pYet now, my own stuff includes a separate business data model, in a separate project, codePayCaddy.Datacode, that includes entities like a bet in a golf gamep  precodepublic class Bet PayCaddyEntity      public virtual string BetName  get set      public virtual int Amount  get set      public virtual ApplicationUser Owner  get set      public virtual DateTime OpenedOn  get set      public virtual DateTime ClosedOn  get set      public ICollectionltBetUsergt Punters  get set   codepre  pNow codeApplicationUsercode is used here to indicate the user that initiated the bet, which will be between them and the codePunterscode. This leaves me stuck with a circular reference problem, where I need a reference to codePayCaddy.Clientcode for the codeApplicationUsercode entity, and that project needs a reference back for the codeBetcode entity.p  pThe Identity framework is highly complex, and simply moving its entities into my data model is out of the question. For now, I have moved my data model into the client project, the same prokect as the Identity code, but I dont want to continue like that if there is a relatively simple way of overcoming this problem.
