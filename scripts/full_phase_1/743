Positive 743 pI am creating an application for doctors and would like to give them the option to send automatic reminders and confirmations to their patients by text message. Assuming a doctor has about 15 appointments per day and the app manages 3 doctors, that gives me 15x3x22 9900 text messages. When sending these to for example Canada or US, I can use Twillio or Plivo where I pay 0.01message which means I only have to charge the user about 120year extra the app works on a subscription basis. However, sending text messages to other countries can cost up to 0.08message driving the price up to almost 1000. And this is using only a very nodest estimate of the users actual needs.p  pThus the main problem is For large amounts of text messages it seems I would have to have a text message license for around 4000year when the license for the app itself costs only about 250tear.p  pThe question then is, is there a cheaper alternative to services like Twillio and Plivo Would it be worth it programming a custom SMS gateway Or are there any other, cheaper servicesp  pI use Parse Cloud Code for all text messages to keep my access codes secret so I am not limited to ObjectiveCp  pThanksp

Positive 743 pI have a a hrefhttpsgroupme.com relnofollowGroupMea contact on my Android phone which I get messages from all the time. It is really annoying, so I can either mute text the GroupMe server and stop getting messages or mute my phone vibrations altogether. The problem with these solutions is that I dont want to completely mute the messages from the server altogether. I want to be able to read them when I decide to. I also dont want to mute my phone altogether because then I cant tell if someone else tried to text me.p  pI tried searching online for help on the topic and I came across the a hrefhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidac.vibrationamphlen relnofollowContact Vibratea application. It had a bunch of features and seemed pretty messy in organization. You could set custom vibrate patterns for each of your contacts. I noticed that it had plenty of default vibrate patterns, but none that just vibrated once and none that vibrated zero times. I tried to create one that didnt vibrate, but that didnt work. I ended up deleting the app altogether.p  pI still havent found a way to silence the vibrate messages for that specific contact while allowing the messages themselves to be received. Solutionp

Negative 743 pIve written an image processing program in MATLAB which makes heavy use of the MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox, especially the morphological operations imopen, imclose as well as imadjust. We do a lot of spline fit operations and medfilt2 and medfilt1 a lot also. p  pWe have a client who wants us to convert this program to Java. I would like to hear a detailed description of a Java image processing library which can duplicate MATLABs functionality in image processing and splines, especially how the interface compares with MATLABs. p  pI have read about Javas Advanced Image Processing Library but I havent been able to find any detailed documentation on it on the web. Also, the little documentation Ive read about it seems to indicate that it uses a rather complex model of images, combining them into tiles and soforth. It would be great if there was a Java library which allowed me to continue to treat gray scale images as just 2D or 3D arrays. p  pAlso, it would be great to learn of any general gotchas in converting between MATLAB and Java. p  phr p  pEdit our app currently segments images of a relatively simple object.  Itp  precode1. Starts with a 3D matrix of gray scale image slices representing a single area 2. Does a medfilt1 to even out each slice.  3. Does some imopen, imclose and imadjust operations on the image to remove some fuzziness,  4. Does some simple thresholding in various areas to find boundary points 5. Fits splines to the boundary points,  6. Uses the 3rd dimension in various ways to further perfect the point matching, especially using medfilt2.  7. Saves each slice with the boundary splines written in color on it. codepre  pI should note that were doing spline fitting rather than spline matching  spline fitting is a least square match with a fixed number of knots  spline matching matches the points exactly with an arbitrary number of knots. I wouldnt want to implement spline matching from more simplistic spline functions. p  pMATLABs Builder JA is an option but I would like to also know whats available in pure Java as well as know what kind of overhead Builder JA involves. p  phr p  pEdit 2p  pNote that we are doing spine emfittingem  using a given points fit to the spline as a way to decide whether to eliminate it  since the data is strongmessystrong, we have a multistep point elimination process, so splines are an strongintegralstrong part of the algorithm. And so, since I cant find any mention of splines in JAI at all, so if anyone knows a java library offering leastsquare spline fitting, that would be wonderful. p  phr p  pEdit 2.5 Were using a leastsquare approximation of a set of points using splines with a fixed number of knots 05 knots. If we have to reimplement that, things will get dicey, since right now were using a MATLAB contributed library for it. p  pAnd we certainly dont want to revisit the algorithm.

Negative 743 pThis might seem like a silly thing to say, the final branch in a parallel activity so Ill clarify. Its a parallel activity with three branches each containing a simple create task, on task changed and complete task. The branch containing the task that is last to complete seems to break. So every task works in its own right, but the last one encounters a problem.p  pSay the user clicks the final tasks link to open the attached infopath form and submits that. Execution gets to the event handler for that onTaskChanged where a taskCompleted variable gets set to true which will exit the while loop. Ive successfully hit a breakpoint on this line so I know that happens. However the final activity in that branch, the completeTask doesnt get hit.p  pWhen submit is clicked in the final form, the operation in progess screen says of for quite a while before returning to the workflow status page. The task that was opened and submitted says Not Started.p  pI can disable any of the branches to leave only two, but the same problem happens with the last to be completed. Earlier on in the workflow I do essencially the same thing. I have another 3 branch parallel activity with each brach containing a task. This one works correctly strongwhich leads me to believe that it might be a problem with having two parallel activites in the same sequential workflowstrong.p  pIve considered the possibility that it might be a correlation token problem. The token that every task branch uses is unique to that branch and its owner activity name is est to that of the branch. It stands to reason that if the task complete variable is indeed getting set to true but the while loop isnt being exited, then theres a wire crossing with the variable somewhere. However Id still have thought that the task status back on the workflow status page would at least say that the task is in progress.p  pThis is a frustrating show stopper of a bug for me. Any thoughts or suggestions would be much appricated so I can investigate them.p

Negative 743 pIm implementing a widget that will be included on articlestory pages of a 3rdparty website. This widget lives in an ltiframegt hosted on our domain.

I can place just about any code that I need to on the parent page e.g., some JavaScript that parses out the content that I need, and the ltiframegt is also totally under my control, but Im not sure how to get the content from the host page into my ltiframegt since theyre hosted on different domains.

Negative 743 pLets say, for illustration, I was writing an iTunes clone app in Cocoa, that was backed by CoreData. For simplifications sake, lets say there are two sections, Library with things like Music, Movies, Radio, etc. And a second section called Playlists which holds usergenerated playlists just dumb lists, not smart playlists.p  pSo the SourceList itself would typically be implemented with codeNSOutlineViewcode, thats generally straightforward.p  pThe Library section of the source list doesnt really house anything generated by the user, only features of the app in essence where the Playlists section only holds custom lists as created by the user. How would one do this with Bindings and CoreData Is it possible just to bind the Playlists section to the users data and have a custom way of displaying the Library featuresp  pIm still getting my feet wet with Bindings and AppKit in general, so please bear with me. I appreciate the help. I should add, Im targeting 10.6 and above.p

Negative 743 pWe are using Wpf Combobox to allow the user to do the following things 1 select items by typing in the first few characters 2 auto complete the entry by filtering the list 3 suggesting the first item to match the letters typed as the selected itemp  pThe challenge is handling the scenario when the user enters characters that are NOT in the list.  This should indicate that the user has either made a mistake OR wants to enter a new item.br The Combobox is bound to custom types and they have validation rules associated with the property being populated with the selection.  We cannot figure out how to identify when the user has typed in an entry NOT IN THE LIST and set the bound property to an invalid value that will trigger the validation.p  pWhen a user enters a string of characters that do not represent an item in the list, the selecteditem becomes null.  Since the selecteditem is null, the property path bound to the forms datacontext object cannot be identified by WPF and so the binding fails.  The business object then retains whatever previous value was set and does not get a new value.p
Negative 743 pI have been working for some years now as C Developer using MS Visual Studio as working platform. Since I privately prefer to use linux, I recently took the chance to move my working environment to linux as well. Since I have been optimizing my windows environment for several years now,  of course it turns out several things are missing or not working as expected. Thus I have some questions for which I could not come with useful answers yet.p  pLets start the following problem different questions will probably follow later. The problem is something I have already stumbled upon several times, whenever I was forced to debug platform specific bugs on non windows platforms.p  pSimply speaking strongHow can I display Unicode UCS2 encoded strings while debugging on linuxstrongp  pNow some more details I have figured so far. Our Lib uses interally a Unicode based String class, which encodes every char as a 16bit Unicode value but we do not support multiword encodings, thus we basically can only use the UCS2 encodable subset of UTF16, but this encompasses nearly all used scripts anyway. This already poses one problem, since most platforms i.e. linux  unix consider codewchartcode types to consist of 4 bytes while on windows it is only 2 bytes, thus  I cannot simply cast the internal string buffer to codewchart code, so I am not sure, if this would really help any debugger.p  pFor stronggdbstrong I have figured, that I can call functions from the debugged code, to print debug messages. Thus I inserted a special function into our lib,  that can arbitrarily transform the string data and write it to a new buffer. Currently I transcode our internal buffer to utf8, since I expect this to be the mostly likely to work.p  pBut so far this solves the problem only partially If the string is latin, then I now get a readable output whereas one cannot directly print the latin data if it is 16 bit encoded, but I also have to deal with other scripts f.e. CJK a.k.a. Hansi  Kanji, cyrillic, greek ... and with dealing I mean I have to specifically debug data using such scripts, since the used scripts directly influence the control flow.  Ofcourse in these cases I only see the ISO chars that correspond to the multiple bytes that make up a utf8 char, which makes debugging CJK data even more cryptic then correctly displayed strings would be.p  pGenerally gdb allows to set several host and target encodings, thus It should be possible, to send the correct encoded utf8 data stream to the console.p  pBut of course Id prefer to use an IDE for debugging. Currently I am trying to make friends with eclipse and CDT, but for debugging I have also tested kdgb. In both applications I could so far only obtain incorrectly decoded utf8 data. On the other hand I once debugged a java project in eclipse on a windows platform and all internal strings were displayed correctly but this application was not using our lib and the corresponding strings, thus at least in some situations eclipse can display unicode chars correctly.p  pThe most annoying point for me is, that so far I could not even come up with any proof, that displaying true unicode data i.e. non ISO chars is working in any setup on linux i.e. even the gdb scripts for QStrings I have found, seem to only display latin chars and skip the remainder, but of course  nearly every linux application seems to support unicode data, thus there  must be people around, that debug true unicode data on linux platforms and I really cannot imagine, that they are all reading hexcodes instead of directly displaying unicode strings.p  pThus any pointers to setups that allow debugging of unicode strings, based on any other string classes f.e. QString and  or IDE would also be appreciated.p

Negative 743 pI have a bit of code that depicts this hypothetical setup below. A class Foo which contains many Bars. Bar belongs to one and only one Foo. At some point, Foo can do a finite loop that lapses 2 iterations. In that loop, something like the following happensp  precodebar  Bar.findwhereinuseiszero bar.inuse  1 codepre  pBasically what findwhereinuseiszero does something like this in as far as SQL goesp  pcodeSELECT  from bars WHERE inuse  0codep  pNow the problem Im facing is that I cannot run the following line of code after bar.inuse 1 is invokedp  precodebar.save codepre  pThe reason is clear, Im still looping and the new Foo hasnt been created, so we dont have a fooid to put into bars.fooid. Even if I set to allow fooid to be NULL, we have a problem where one of the bars can fail validation and the existing one was saved to the database. In my application, that doesnt work. The entire request is atomic, either all succeeds or fails together. What happens next, is that in my loop, I have the potential to select the same exact bar that I did on a previous iteration of the loop since the inuse flag will not be set to 1 until foo.save is called. p  pIs there anyway to work around this condition and temporarily set the inuse attribute to 1 for subsequent iterations of the loop so that I retrieve an available bar instancep

Negative 743 pAs I understand it, when you use the shorthand property codebackgroundcode, the browser first sets all background properties to their default values and then puts in the values that youre declaring. Is it then better to use codebackgroundcolorwhitecode instead of codebackgroundwhitecode Does this change when you are putting in more values such as background position or background image Or is it always best to declare attributes individuallyp  pIm thinking that there must be some sort of tipping point where the savings in bytes balance the processing time gained by specifying attributes individually. However, I could be completely wrong  thats why Im asking here.p

Negative 743 pI need a C library which lets me exec a statically linked binary, without invoking the emexecveem system call.

Negative 743 pHI,p  pI have a bit of a threading conundrum. I have a UIView that draws an arc over time depending on the rate at which certain things are occurring in my code. It can never stop drawing and the rate at which it draws can change. p  pWhen I started out doing this I thought to myself that I should calculate the percent of the arc to draw in a separate thread. This is fine. The problem is that in order to redraw the arc based on the new percent I need to perform the updateArc function on the main thread.p  pSeeing as my requirement is for it to continuously update the main thread is never free to do anything else. If I dont use the main thread to call the arc update function the update never happens.p  pHow can I can continually update a UIView without interrupting the main threadp

Negative 743 pLets say I have a created a Form class and a CustomControl class.p  pOn my Form I have two instances of the CustomControl, and a Panel.p  pPanel has 4 event handlers MouseEnter to give a different cursor, MouseLeave to reset the cursor, MouseDown to start the dragging thread, and MouseUp to kill the dragging thread and do postdrag logic.p  pI can drag the Panel onto the CustomControl. When I do this, the code in Form detects what I have done and deletes Panel from Form.Controls, passes some metainformation to CustomControl, which then creates a Panel on itself.p  pBasically, it is a handover. The Panel object now belongs to the CustomControl. emThis is necessary. Its complicated to explain why, but imagine the custom control has something like scrollbars, and its necessary for the Panel to belong to the CustomControl so that it will scroll with the CustomControl.emp  pNow, when I click down on the Panel in the CustomControl, the Panels MouseDown is triggered, it gets deleted from CustomControl.Controls and sends some metainformation back to the Parent the Form, which then recreates the Panel as it was at the start  however emalready in a dragging stateem so that the user can reposition the Panel onto the second CustomControl, or perhaps put it back onto the Form. The function which creates the Panel when the Form is first initialised is exactly the same function which creates it now.p  pHowever, the Panels MouseDown has not been triggered. The mouse emisem down, but the event is not firing because the mouse was already down when it was created. So, I manually call the MouseDown handler in the function in Form which accepts the metainformation from CustomControl.p  pUnfortunately, this only halfworks. The MouseUp handler isnt firing. I can pick up the Panel off the CustomControl and drag it around on the Form as expected, but when I release the mouse, the Panel is stuck to the cursor.p  pIm not really sure how to get around thisp  pAn ideal solution would be for, when the metainformation is passed back to Form and the new Panel is created, the MouseDown event to somehow fire naturally as though the user had just clicked down on the Panel.p

The code is included belowp  precodeimport java.awt.Component import java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.Graphics import java.awt.image.BufferedImage import java.io.File import java.io.IOException  import javax.imageio.ImageIO import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JScrollPane import javax.swing.WindowConstants  public class Grapher       private static JFrame frame  new JFrameTest Frame     private static Graph graph  null     private static JScrollPane jsp  null public Grapher     frame.setDefaultCloseOperationWindowConstants.DISPOSEONCLOSE   public void displayString fileName      ifjsp  null         frame.getContentPane.removejsp     graph  new GraphfileName     jsp  new JScrollPanegraph     frame.getContentPane.addjsp     frame.setSizegraph.getPreferredSize     frame.setVisibletrue   private class Graph extends Component     BufferedImage img     Override     public void paintGraphics g          g.drawImageimg, 0, 0, null          public GraphString fileName          setFocusablefalse         try              img  ImageIO.readnew FilefileName          catch IOException e System.err.printlnError reading   fileNamee.printStackTrace        codepre  pAnyway, my problem is that whenever I call the codedisplaycode command this window steals the focus of everything java, including eclipse, which can be really agravating. I even tried adding codesetFocusablefalsecode in the constructor, but it still manages to steal the focus. How do I tell it to be focusable but not focus automatically with constructionp

Negative 743 pI have a Java web application that has a website for user interactions. To authenticate users I configured the application via web.xml to use FORMbased authentication. Users are forwarded to a login page and everything is fine so far.p  pNow we are developing a desktop client in C for this web application which accesses the application via RESTful web services. I implemented these services in the same web app as the web site and of course the caller of the web service should be authenticated too. But now Im facing the problem, that whenever I call a web service the server is returning the login pages HTML as response.p  pI think it would be cool to be able to use another loginconfig for my REST service servlet which would probably use BASIC authentication then.p  pGoogle didnt bring up much, but I cant believe Im the first one being in such situation.

Negative 743 pIve been working on debugging some jQuery on a BlackBerry OS5 device the 8530. There are a number of problems, but one that I have narrowed down is related to jQuerys code.eachcodep  pThe logic is as suchp  precodeobjectArray.eachfunction    alerttest    if...some logic...        this.addClasstestClass      codepre  pIn any normal browser I get the alert, click OK, and then see that particular item in this case, a TD get an updated class if the logic statement is true. It then repeats through the rest of the items, each getting an alert, me OKing it, and me seeing that particular TDs class get updated.p  pOn the BlackBery 8530, however, I get each alert but the TDs arent updated onebyone. Instead, they all get updated at once after the last alert based on the if logic of the last TD only.p  pOdds are that there are serious JS issues with this particular browser, but Im wondering if there is a way to get around this. Are there alternatives to using code.eachcode in jQuery p  pUPDATEp  pA more detailed code examplep  precodeTRs.eachfunction     var TR  this     var checkBoxTD  TR.findtd.td3     var checkBox  checkBoxTD.findinput      alertcheckBox.ischecked      if checkBox.ischeckedtrue        checkBoxTD.addClassnotSelected       codepre  pIm looping through each TR of a TABLE. Within each TR is a TD .td3 that contains a checkbox. I need to check each one. If its not checked, I need to add a class to the TD.p  pIn good browsers, the alert will show a true or false, and, based on that particular alert, you will see the class being applied appropriately to that row as you dismiss the alert. It then repeats for every row.p  pIn BB OS5s browser, each alert pops up with the proper value, but the classes arent updated until AFTER the very last alertloop, so every TD class then used the logic of the last loop only. p  pUPDATE 2 fixp  pThanks to Alex, I did some more playing with this and found a way to get this to work in the stubborn browser.p  precodeTRs.eachfunctionidx     var TR  this     var checkBoxTD  TR.findtd.td3     var checkBox  checkBoxTD.findinput      alertcheckBox.ischecked      if checkBox.ischeckedtrue        TRs.eqidx.findtd.td3.addClassnotSelected  lt the fix       codepre  pThe difference is that Im going back to the main jQuery object TRs and specifically grabbing one of the elements from it based on its index. p  pSo based on that, my final question is Does the above solution have any downsides for the good browsers Is there a performance hit p
Negative 743 pI am working on debugging an application that seems to leak memory like crazy most of it seems due to fragmentation from pinned objectsdownloaded image data in a WriteableBitmap. However, I am not intentionally using GC.Handle or anything like it. All I do is store the data in a codeMemoryStreamcode, and reference it like that. p  pWhat operations pin data in memory, that dont explicitly say so Also, how can I find what pinned it using WinDbgp  pstrongEDITstrong Per request, here is a slightly sanitized output of one of a GCRoot on a System.Int32 array adjacent to a large block of free memory. This is representative of all of the large free blocks.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong After spending time with my new friends WinDbg and SOS, I found that codeWriteableBitmapscode AND codeMemoryStreamcode objects, are both pinned, and should be allocated carefully to prevent memory fragmentation.

Negative 743 pIm new to ruby on rails development but I am a little confused with why different gems work on some servers and not on others. p  pIntro I started learning rails on a hrefhttpruby.railstutorial.org relnofollowhttpruby.railstutorial.orga. I also started watching some railscasts by Ryan Bates on a hrefhttprailscasts.com relnofollowhttprailscasts.comap  pOn railscasts, Ryan was talking about using sunspot for text searching. Then, someone in the comment says that using sunspot for production server is tedious. If it works locally on your machine, shouldnt it work on production serverp  pOn railstutorial,  mike was talking about search as well but he mentions Thinking Sphinx and he said to use it for shared host or dedicated server. For heroku, use their docs on text search.p  pThis is my first web development project and came from Windows background so backend servers are still very unknown to me. Is it because of the different types of server Ex Nginx, Apache... p  pThanks muchp

Negative 743 pIm working on a log in system for an application, and Im not sure what information I should store. Currently, I only store users ID into a session variable, and if that variable is set, it will load the user from the database with all of the required information. But, I also want to have a remember me option, for which I would require cookies, and Im not sure what to store in them. If were only to store the user id, that would be risky, since someone could just change the id and be a different user. My idea currently is to do thisp  precodearray  arrayuser[username], user[pass]             serializebase64encodearray codepre  pSo if the cookie was set, I would unserialize it, and find the user with the password and username the password itself is hashed in MD5.

Negative 743 pI was wondering if anyone knows a way to prevent building unneeded device drivers when building  the 2.6.32 kernel in Ubuntu 10.4 on VB  The reason I ask is we have to do a project for my operating systems class that involves adding some system calls to the kernel and the instructions say that after you add your call you need to rebuild the kernelwhich takes like 3 freakin hours and I know its because Ubuntu doesnt know which device drivers I need on so it builds them all so Im wondering if there is a way to have it only build the ones I need and if so how to go about that or if anyone knows a way of being able to test added system calls without rebuilding the whole kernelas this is really the issuep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 743 pIve recently joined an asp.net mvc project well under way where there isnt much consistency in dealing with exceptions in the controller some devs return data to the client to let the user know whats wrong, others throw them back so they get to the serverlevel handler that processes and logs them  without letting the user know whats up. p  pIt seems obvious to me that both approaches are wrong on their own, and need to complement each other instead what Im stuck at, is how to do that. I assume the eventual exception handler  logger could redirect the user to an error webpage upon catching something particularly nasty, but that limits the mechanism to just severe stuff.p  pIm kind of looking for a way to do both throw and return ... at a time when I catch an exception, so I get it sorted and logged server side and get data client side that lets me tell the user theres been a hiccup.p  pMy expertise with asp.net is very limited, and while I believe I understand mvc enough for it to not be an issue, this is kind of a what is the best practice question from someone working with people who dont bother with best practices much.p

Negative 743 pI have a WCF Service hosted on IIS 7 that runs successfully for a period of time, then fails to communicate to other network locations  I suspect there are no TCP ports available to connect to the outside world p  pstrongBackground of applicationstrongp  pMy system transcodes large media files  which takes time. I have a centrally hosted WCF service which is is located on server A  which will be referred to as Central WCF Service. I then have many client services which do the actual transcoding of the media files on different servers B,C,D,E,F and so on  which will be referred to as Client Processor services. The Central WCF Service manages which Client Processor Service the Transcode Jobs get sent to be processed . Each of these Client Processor Services is a self hosted WCF service, they basically  do the long running process, and get polled by the Central WCF Service checking job progress percentage. The Central WCF service therefore opens up a lot of connections to these clients to poll them for their job progresss, polling occurs roughly once every 23 seconds to each of the clients.p  pThe Central WCF service stores a string list of the addresses for the Client Processor services. The code which Is used to poll each client is descrbied below  stripped down version p  precodepublic ClientProcessorClient getClientByaddressstring address      Binding bidning  new NetTcpBindingSecurityMode.None     return new ClientProcessorClientbidning, new EndpointAddressaddress   public void pollJobs      foreach string clientAddress in clients              ClientProcessorClient client  getClientByaddressclientAddress         int progress  client.GetProgress         client.Close          Do stuff with progress       codepre  pstrongWhat happens when it breaksstrongp  pI can submit many transcode jobs to the Central WCF Service and it submits jobs to the clients successfully updating progress etc. After around an hour of processing the server that the Central WCF service is hosted on stops working properly. Errors are thrown by the Central WCF Service codeInsufficient winsock resources available to complete socket connection initiation.code when trying to contact the Client WCF services. The Client WCF services are all pingable from a WCF Test Client running on my local machine. Also I have noticed that when in this state the server cannot view network file resources  I have logged in remotely and tried to locate a network attached storage folder, it fails to connect. I CAN however make calls TO that server e.g. I can open a WCF Test Client and connect to the Central WCF Service and call its ping methods. Communications are allowed IN but not OUT from the server.p  pstrongFew points of intereststrongp  pIn the faulted state the connections TO the server can be made, but not FROM the server.p  pEach of my services  Central WCF service and Client Processor Service  are singleton instances.p  pThe Central WCF Service is hosted in IIS 7 and application pool Recycling is disabledp  pUnfortunately named pipe is not an option  the clients and servers are on different machines p  pstrongMy thoughtsQuestionsstrongp  pAll signs point towards the server running out of TCP sockets. Am I setting up the WCF codeClientProcessorClientcodes properly Am I disposing of them properly Do I need to wrap them in a codeusingcode statement Does anybody know how I can debugdiagnose where the problem occursp  pThanksp

Negative 743 pSuppose Im designing a robot that can pickup various tools and use them. I would create a Robot class which has Pickup method to pick the tools I wanted to use. For each tools I would create a class for it, say, Knife class which has Cut method. After invoking a Pickup method on Robot now I want to tell my robot to cut. So for OOP concept I have to tell the robot, not knife And the Cut method is on Knife so how can I invoke that I have to implement some kind of codeUseToolCurrentlyHeldcode on Robot to propagate my commands to Knife. Or I just directly call the knife that my robot hold directly using this codemyrobot.ToolCurrentlyInHand.Cutcodep  pI feel its weird that a parent method must have EVERYTHING to take care of classes they contain. Now I have duplicate methods, like the Knife has codeCutcode and now Robot must have codeUseCutOnKnifecode only to invoke codeCutcode on Knife because good OOP practice is to abstract the Knife out and make it feel like ordering a Robot without worrying about internal information like Knife.p  pAnother question, if I composing a music I would create codeMusiccode class which contains  many codeMeasurecode class to store note information. In one Measure there can be many codeNotecode class inside it which Note class will have information like, where in the measure does this note reside, or how long that note plays. Now I want to add one note on measure 45 placed on about middle of the measure. To create the Measure I have to call codeCreateMeasure45code on Music and then call codeCreateNote0.5fcode on Measure The method to create is on the parent like that And if now I want to change that note to be at 0.25 on the measure instead, the one responsible to have method to change Note is the codeNotecode class itself or codeMeasurecode class Or I must implement the method to change notes on the topmost codeMusiccode class p  pThis is overview of my classes p  precodeclass Music       ListltMeasuregt measures  new ListltMeasuregt       methods...   class Measure       int measureNumber      ListltNotegt notes  new ListltNotegt       methods...   class Note       float positionInMeasure from 0 to 1  codepre  pAs now the Music class is on top of everything I now have to issue everything through Music And chaining the method to finally call the innermost classp

Negative 743 pI would like some suggestions regarding testing a web application ASP.Net MVC 3 in my case from multiple URLs.p  pThe site will behave differently based on which domain name the request is coming from.

Negative 743 pHeres what I understand about using HttpWebRequest to make a request asyncronouslyp  pThe essential structure for making an asynchronous web request is to call BeginGetResponse and start a timer at the same time. If the response doesnt timeout, BeginGetResponse will call a callback method that will call EndGetResponse and read the response. If the response does timeout, a different callback method to the timer gets called and WebRequest.Abort is invoked.p  pThis structure hinges on the fact that Abort and EndGetResponse are exclusive. Calling Abort after EndGetResponse has basically no effect and calling EndGetResponse after Abort causes EndGetResponse to throw an exception which can then be caught and handled however you want to handle timeouts.p  pMy problem is when I need to make several hundred requests per second to several services and one service starts becoming very, very latent. The Timeout callback might get called after 500ms and calls Abort and my program continues happily. But because the service still hasnt returned 10 seconds later, the first thread started by BeginGetResponse is still waiting and the network connection resource is unavailable for use by any future requests.p  pIs there any way to have a timeout free up the resources of the thread that is supposedly timing out If not, is there something like a Web.config value that I can set that will timeout the request on a different layer of the network than the applicationp

Negative 743 pI am developing a Game Project and wish to use the Object Composition pattern to give me a great deal of flexibility. I currently override message forwarding methods in order that the Composite can invoke the methods of its Components.p  pThe only downside to this is that forwardingTargetForSelector only works when there is to be only one target. If I have a Composite with two Components that have the same selector, then I will have to resort to using the much slower forwardInvocation method and perform the NSInvocation on both the targets.p  pFrom reading a few books on advanced ObjectiveC and Runtime reference, it seems that I may be able to forward messages by dynamically creating an implementation that will invoke the IMP in the child Component Classes. I would use the Runtime method classaddmethod to do this.p  pMy question is, does anyone know if Apple considers this to be private API and thus against App Store Rules Has anyone used classaddmethod in Apps that have passed review p  pIt is common knowledge that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7720947methodswizzlinginios5method swizzlinga is not allowed in the store, but this is not exactly the same thing. One typical example was swizzling the drawRect on UINavigationBar, before the Appearance API was available. This would be adding methods to my own object rather than messing with Apples own API.p  pThanks for Reading p  pLawrencep

Especially because the width of the black unwanted margin isnt constant and changes according to the specified width of the video. Has anyone had the same problem before Any idea or help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you all.p

Negative 743 pI thought of using tests at runtime to determine the endianness so that I can be sure of the behaviour of shifts, and noticed a somewhat peculiar optimization by my compiler.

Negative 743 pWe have a website developed using Rails and we use Active Merchant to take payment from users.p  pNow we have a new requirement to allow our users to request money from us and for us to send the money to them by PayPal automatically.p  pOf course, well implement some business logic to ensure that only certain users are allowed to do this.p  pBut the interface should be pretty simple.  A loggedin user enters a PayPal account email address and the amount including currency he wants from us.  Then well send the money to him by PayPal.p  pWe dont need to verify that the userentered email address is associated with an existing PayPal account, because the person receiving the email will be prompted to create an account to receive the money on PayPal.p  pIve looked at PayPal Adaptive Payment and Mass Payment.  Our requirement is pretty simple and we dont need features like sending money to multiple recipients, chained payment, etc.p  pOur main requirement is that this is done automatically. In other words, we dont want to have to manually enter our PayPal account password every time someone requests money from us.  Is this possiblep  pWhich PayPal API is best suited for our requirementp  pThank youp

Second The only difference between production and test versions is in sequence, which looks like thisp  precodeCREATE SEQUENCE actionidseq  INCREMENT 1  MINVALUE 1  MAXVALUE 9223372036854775807  START 89  CACHE 1  CYCLE ALTER TABLE actionidseq OWNER TO databaseuser GRANT ALL ON TABLE actionidseq TO public GRANT ALL ON TABLE actionidseq TO databaseuser codepre  pIn test version was created without thouse GRANTs of course for another datbase user.p  pSo finally my question could this be a problem . Or mayble sqlalchemy is the problem p

Negative 743 pI wrote some sample test code to verify the functionality of using boost upgrade mutexes to implement a readwrite mutex lock over a boost list container.  I have ten threads, 5 are readers, 5 are writers.br I used smart pointers to simplify memory management and allow the same object to be contained in multiple lists.  The writers are constantly removing and reinserting objects into their respective list while the readers are periodically iterating through the list. It all seems to work as expected but when calling the list erase member function it is having to find the entry to delete when I already have it.br Is the erase method smart enough to know the entry to be erased without having to search for it again or is it optimized to eliminate the search when the list element is known If it does the search, then is there a straightforward way to extend it so a unique lock can be applied only around the actual removal from the list and not also while finding the list element Here is the code I linked with boost 1.51 library and tested with vs2008.p  precode      INCLUDE FILES      include ltboostthread.hppgt   include ltboostdatetime.hppgt   include ltboostthreadlocks.hppgt     include ltboostthreadsharedmutex.hppgt                     include ltboostcontainerlist.hppgt         include ltboostsharedptr.hppgt   include ltboostmakeshared.hppgt   include ltiostreamgt    using namespace std        LOCAL DEFINES      define NUMTHREADS  10   define NUMWIDTH    5    ifdef UNIQUEMUTEX   define MAINLISTMUTEX           glistMutex   define INTLISTMUTEX            gintListMutex   define FLOATLISTMUTEX          gfloatListMutex   else   define MAINLISTMUTEX           glistMutex   define INTLISTMUTEX            glistMutex   define FLOATLISTMUTEX          glistMutex   endif        LOCAL TYPEDEFS      typedef boostupgrademutex                   myMutex   typedef boostsharedlockltmyMutexgt            SharedLock   typedef boostupgradetouniquelockltmyMutexgt UniqueLock   typedef boostupgradelockltmyMutexgt           UpgradeLock   class myDataIntf   typedef boostsharedptrltmyDataIntfgt          myDataIntfPtr   typedef boostcontainerlistltmyDataIntfPtrgt  myList        LOCAL CLASS DECLARATIONS      class myDataIntf      public      virtual char getDataTypevoid  0       class intData  public myDataIntf      private      int  data    public      intDataint newdata  datanewdata      intDatavoid               extern int instIntDeletes          instIntDeletes            char getDataTypevoid               return Int            int getDatavoid               return data            void setDataint newdata               data  newdata             class floatData  public myDataIntf      private      float  data    public      floatDatafloat newdata  datanewdata      floatDatavoid               extern int instFloatDeletes          instFloatDeletes            char getDataTypevoid               return Float            float getDatavoid               return data            void setDatafloat newdata               data  newdata                 LOCALLY DEFINED GLOBAL DATA        Define one mutex per linked list   myMutex  glistMutex   myMutex  gintListMutex   myMutex  gfloatListMutex    int instReadFloatCount[NUMTHREADS]   int instWriteFloatCount[NUMTHREADS]   int instReadIntCount[NUMTHREADS]   int instWriteIntCount[NUMTHREADS]   int instFloatDeletes  0   int instIntDeletes  0        Worker Thread function      void workerFuncint inst, myList assignedlist, myMutex  mutex         boostposixtimemillisec workTime1inst      myListiterator            i      int                         adddelay  0      int                         addfcount  0      int                         addicount  0       instReadFloatCount[inst]  0      instReadIntCount[inst]  0      instWriteIntCount[inst]  0      instWriteFloatCount[inst]  0       mutexgtlock      cout ltlt Worker  ltlt inst ltlt        for i   assignedlistgtbegin i  assignedlistgtend i               cout ltlt igtgetDataType         if  0  strcmpFloat, igtgetDataType                       floatData  f  floatDataigtget            cout ltlt   ltlt fgtgetData ltlt                    if  0  strcmpInt, igtgetDataType                       intData  f  intDataigtget            cout ltlt   ltlt fgtgetData ltlt                       cout ltlt endl      mutexgtunlock        Do some work for 10 seconds.      for  int tick  0 tick lt 100001inst1 tick               adddelay         boostthisthreadsleepworkTime         if  inst lt NUMTHREADS2                       reader  Get a shared lock that allows multiple readers to             access the linked list.

Negative 743 pI have a problem whereby I have lots of very small web service calls to a Java endpoint hosted on Oracle GlassFish 3.1.X.  I added this service as a Service Reference using the remote wsdl file and use a BasicHttpBinding to reach it.p  pSince the service is located half the world away plus going across the internet, we frequently experience some packet loss when reaching the destination.  We are looking at any way possible to reduce the impact of these occurrences.  We have been using Wireshark to give us detailed knowledge of what is going across the wire to our destination, and back again.  I was curious to see that for every single request we generate, we are sending 2 packets.  The packet boundary is always between the HTTP header and the codeltsEnvelopegtcode tag.  To me this is a big overhead, particularly in my environment where I want to minimise the amount of packets sent to reduce overall packetloss.  p  pIn most cases 99 of our calls, the HTTP header packet is 210 bytes followed by a SOAP envelope packet of 291 bytes excluding the 54 bytes of TCPIP overhead for each packet.  Totalling these gives 501 bytes  just over a third of our Max Segment Size of 1460 bytes.  Why isnt WCF sending this HTTP POST request as a single packet of 501 bytes 555 bytes if you include the 54 bytes of TCPIP overheadp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXhF2u.jpg altWireshark reassembly screenshotp  pDoes anyone know why it does this  It almost seems as if the HttpWebRequest object is calling .Flush on the stream after writing its headers but Im not sure why it would do thisp  pIve tried different combinations on thesep  precodeServicePointManager.UseNagleAlgorithm  false ServicePointManager.Expect100Continue  false codepre  pWith no effect.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pWrong delIve investigated a bit further and when a HttpWebRequest.GetRequestStream is called, it does write the headers to the stream immediately.  At some stage before you write to the Stream that is given back to you, the network would Flush these I guess Unless a deliberate flush is happening somewhere.  When you finally start writing to the stream, it has already sent the header packet.  Not sure how to prevent this, it seems a very hard assertion inside the HttpWebRequest code that called GetRequestStream will write the headers.  For my small requests, I want nothing to be written until I have closed the stream but that goes against the streaming nature of it.delp

Negative 743 pIm working on an existing WAR application that does not currently use Groovy or Grails. I am interested in using Grails to implement a new feature, with an eye toward using it more heavily in the future. However, this needs to be deployed as part of the existing WAR file.p  pI havent found any documentation talking about such a use case. I have run codegrails warcode on a test application, then dissected the resulting WAR file to see whats in the web.xml and other configuration files. I figure I emcouldem manually add the required configuration to my existing web.xml, but at that point Id be stuck manually maintaining it, and would lose much of the benefit of the codegrailscode command.p  pIt seems like Grails wants full control of its own little world, and I dont think Im interested in going that heavily against the grain on my first project. I probably wouldnt be using GORM as the model isnt a simple relational store, so Grails could be overkill in this case anyway. Perhaps something like Ratpack would be better suited to my needs.p  pBut before abandoning Grails completely, I figured Id see if Im missing something obvious. Can I easily do what I want to do p

Negative 743 pI am running a large ASP.net 4.0 website. It uses a popular .Net content management system, has thousands of content items, hundreds of concurrent users  is basically a heavy website.p  pOver the course of 1 day the memory usage of the IIS7 worker process can rise to 810GB.  The server has 16GB installed and is currently set to recycle the app pool once per day.p  pI am getting pressured to reduce memory usage. Much of the memory usage is due to caching of large strings of data  but the cache interval is only set to 510 minutes  so these strings should eventually expire from memory.p  pHowever after running RedGate Memory Profiler I can see what I think are memory leaks. I have filtered my Instance List results by objects that are kept in memory exclusively by Disposed Objects  I read on the RedGate forum that this is how you find memory leaks .  This gave me a long list of strings that are being held in memory.p  pFor each string I use Instance Retention Graph to see what holds it in memory.  The System.string objects seem to have been cached at some point by System.Web.Caching.CacheDependency.  If I follow the graph all the way up it goes through various other classes including System.Collections.Specialized.ListDictionary until it reaches System.Web.FileMonitor.  This makes some sense as the strings are paths to a file images  PDFs  etc.p  pIt seems that the CMS is caching paths to files, but these cached objects are then leaked.  Over time this builds up and eats up RAM.p  pSorry this is long winded... Is there a way for me to stop these memory leaks Or to clear them down without resorting to recycling the app pool  Can I find what class  code is doing the caching to see if I can fix the leakp

Negative 743 pThe websphere application server ships with its own jdbc provider for oracle database. That is why when we createa new JDBC provider we can choose Oracle. Now if it is providing its own driver, basically it is providign an implementation of JDBC API for Oracle db. So in the IBMWebspherAppServerlib directorty I was hoping to see ojdbc14.jar. But I cannot see it. It is in my COracleora92lib directory. Why WAS does not ship with its own jdbc implemenation just like it does with its own jdkjre implemnetation.p

For example, the file filters in the search dialog might be blank for one of the two popups, and neither of the two search windows works.p  pThe same dialogs, if opened with keyboard shortcuts click the Search menu, press F on the keyboard to open the File Search dialog, display only one dialog.

For the sake of testing it is spinning in a forloop, requesting some information from the Storage and processing it processing is really cheap.p  pIt turns out that this is emslowem. Ive checked the process list and noticed codechrome typerenderercode eating lots of CPU, so I thought that it might be redrawing the page or doing some kind of DOM processing after each message, since the Storage is running in the page context. Ok, Ive decided to try to move the Storage to a separate Worker so that the page is totally idle now and ended up getting even worse performanceexactly twice slower Ive tried a Shared Worker and a Dedicated Worker with explicit codeMessageChannelcodes with the same results.p  pSo, here is my question why sending a message from a Worker to another Worker is emexactly twiceem slower than sending a message from a Worker to the page Are they sending messages through the page Is it by design or a bug I was going to check the source code, but Im afraid its a bit too complex and, probably, someone is already familiar with this part of Chromium internalsp  pemP.S.

So I tried emstatic finalem and it would not compile nor just emstaticem Is there a way to do this  I need to call a timeconsuming initialization function from several different methods in my class, so just moving the variable to class scope wouldnt work. Further, since local variables are not automatically initialized, I cannot include an emifem test for emnullem around the variable before assigning it a value. I suppose I could create a variable at in the class scope for each method in my class, but managing it would be a pain to manage. The best analogy would be something if I were to include something like the following in every methodp  precodepublic myfunc1      final String funcName  java.lang.Thread.currentThread.getStackTrace[1].getMethodName  public myfunc2      final String funcName  java.lang.Thread.currentThread.getStackTrace[1].getMethodName  codepre  pemfuncNameem in this case will get a unique value in each method, but the initialization is expensive.p

The login screen is displayed in the browser but the test line p  precodeselenium.WaitForScreenToDisplay30000 codepre  pdoes not return so the test times out with an error message. The tests will fail in this way completely at random  about half of them fail, but not consistently the same ones.p  pThe application itself behaves perfectly when a human being interacts with the browser. The selenium logs dont give much in the way of clues  the last line is always waiting for page, eg ....Command request waitForPageToLoad[30000,... ].p  pStepping through the test in the VS debugger never reproduces the problem.p  pThe actual code where the problem manifests itself isp  precode    selenium.OpenGetRestartPageURL     selenium.WaitForPageToLoad30000      selenium.ClickButton     selenium.WaitForPageToLoad30000 lt this is where it times out even though the expected screen that is launched by Button is now displayed in the browser codepre  pIs there a known problem, or a workaround for this Is it an issue with IE9 and Selenium 1.0 Its come out of the blue at a critical time.p

Naturally I went to the a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2libraryjson.html relnofollowDocumentationa but I didnt find a standardized way to know which exceptions can be raised in certain functions like codedumpcode or codeloadcode. It is not clear to me at first glance if just catching codeTypeErrorcode will be enough.p  pWhich are the recommendations to be sure that were catching everything and just enough about a particular modulefunctionp

Negative 743 pIm working on making a photo booth running on a Raspberry Pi using Python and OpenCV. I found a great code example of how to capture images from a web cam here. a hrefhttpjosephsoares.comprogramacaopythonpythonopencvsalvarimagemdacameranodisco relnofollowhttpjosephsoares.comprogramacaopythonpythonopencvsalvarimagemdacameranodiscoap  pThe code that is provided alone works perfect on both the Pi and on my Windows PC. When I start adding code to this Im having issues. I can no longer see what the web cam is seeing on the Pi and on Windows it is hit or miss. They are both capturing pictures though. In Windows it will actually display the image taken in the frame. If I revert back to the original code, again it works just fine.p  pIm basically using a loop to give a count down before the picture is taken and flashing a light on the Arduino to represent the digit output that will be added in. I originally thought it was a memory issue on the Pi but it not working on my desktop is making me think otherwise.

My phones RAM is only half the size of my computers RAM, yet my phones stack is over 1000 times smaller.

Negative 743 pThis is a bit of an openended question, since I am just starting out on the project.p  pProblem I have clients who cannot install webbrowsers on their machines, and are stuck with IE6. The app we are selling them is a webbased app using a lot of javascript and jquery.p  pSolution Implement a windows application that has a webbrowser control based on webkit since the regular webbrowser control is not going to support javascript and jquery, which loads the app.p  pI started doing research, and I found 2 controls  a hrefhttpscode.google.compopenwebkitsharp relnofollowhttpscode.google.compopenwebkitsharpa and a hrefhttpwebkitdotnet.sourceforge.net relnofollowhttpwebkitdotnet.sourceforge.netap  pI started off with the second one, and tried the sample app they built, only to discover that the version of webkit they used is really old and doesnt run our app right.p  pSo my current solution is to compile webkit myself and include the newer version in the control and see how that works out.p  pSince this is a timesensitive issue I thought Id also ask for the experience of StackOverflow at the same time I am going down my route, to see if there is a simpler solution, or if there are any libraries or prebuilt controls I could use that I missed in my searchp  pThank you for any helpp

Negative 743 pI wrote a neat little knockout.js binding for Yesod a Haskell web framework, but Im having a bit of trouble dealing with optionally defined values.  The Haskell part of the binding is designed to serve up a fragment of javascript which makes an Ajax call to the same handler, and which receives a JSON object which is parsed by ko.mapping.  There are a few hooks for customization, too.p  pThats all fine and dandy, but Im having problems dealing with optional values.  If I serve up a value with an optional record, the JSON emitter treats it as optional and doesnt emit it.p  pSo, for example, the JSON response for a request forp  precodedata Foo  Foo  bar  Maybe Int                 , baz  Int                 serveThis  Foo serveThis  Foo Nothing 0 codepre  pis   baz 0 p  pI understand why that is and that I can change it but Id rather not, if possible.  The problem is that when I call ko.mapping.fromJS on the JSON representation of serveThis, the bar field is not turned into an observable.  Okay, I get that too.  And I can use the with binding to do conditional data binding.  But I dont know enough JavaScript to conditionally define computed observables.p  pMy real code looks likep  precodevar ViewModel  function data    ko.mapping.fromJSdata, , this    this.notes.stdDev.percent  ko.computed function       return numeral this.notes.stdDev .format0   , this   codepre  pSo, so if the standard deviation isnt defined on the Haskellside, it wont be emitted as a JSON field, and so ko.mapping wont make it an observable.  So how do I define the percentage representation conditionallyp

Negative 743 pi am creating a Windows CE 6.0 in Visual Studio 2005 with Platform builder. I integrated a stream device driver via USB HID. I also have a small application that opens a connection to the device and reads data from it. When i build a DebugVersion of this Windows CE 6.0 and debug it on the device i can start the application and the communication to the device works fine. Now i build a ReleaseVersion no changes of Sources of the Windows CE 6.0, run  it on the device and start the application on the device. When i try to read data from the device by ReadFile, i guess this calls XXXRead from the stream driver my windows crashes and reboots. Its too bad, because i cant debug the CE where the windows exactly crashes... because it does not crash in debug version .p  pWhat are the differences between Debug and Release Version of WinCE 6 Does anyone have a hint at which part of the Stream Device driver i need to have a closer look to solve this problem I know that in DebugRelease the Project settings are not adopted.

Negative 743 pI was looking to create a codeGridViewcode that stretches across the entire screen. However, when the user first opens the screen, the top of the first item should be about halfway up the screen.p  pFor example lets say we have a codeGridViewcode of 12 items displayed 3 x 4. When the user first opens the screen, only the first six items would be seen with a large margin at the top of the screen. The user can then scroll the list to see the other items. The top items would eventually reach all the way to the top of the screen.p  pIf I was using a codeListViewcode, this is simple. I merely create a 0dp headerView with a large top margin. But, codeGridViewscode do not allow for headers. What is the best way to handle this situationp

Negative 743 pBy this jsperf a hrefhttpjsperf.comfunctionvsconstructorvseval19 relnofollowhttpjsperf.comfunctionvsconstructorvseval19a, the constructp  precodevar fn2  new Functionreturn 1  2 codepre  pyields a function which takes more time to be called than the function defined byp  precodevar fn1  function      return 1  2  codepre  pWhy is this so Apparently the overhead lies only in calling the function, not in running its body so the body itself is apparently optimized. This has be shown by other tests on jsperf.p  pUsing the function constructor makes sense when dynamically generating code i.e. using SpiderMonkey as a Javascript JIT compiler so it is bad to see that there is a performance penalty. Using codeevalcode instead of the function constructor is faster but codeevalcode makes the whole scope accessible to the function which is not what I want.p  pIt is interesting to see that this versionp  pvar fn4  new Functionreturn function   return 1  2 p  preturns a function as fast as codefn1code from above. However, doesnt this blowup the inner function as it still carries around a handle to the empty scope of the outer function Assume that I have to create many of these functions so that these microoptimizations could make sense.p

Negative 743 pIve recently installed Python 3.3 in addition Python 2.7 on my Computer Windows 7, 32bit. Python 3.3 gives you the possibility of adding a shebang line at top of your .py files so when you execute them it can select which Python version to use. Since Pyscripter doesnt recognise this shebang lines, i wrote a programm which reads the first line of a .py file and then opens it in Pyscripter with the correspondent Argument. It looks like thisp  precodeusrbinenv python2.7 from sys import argv from os import system if lenargvgt1     file  openargv[1]     shebangfile.readline     if shebang.split[1] in python2,python2.7         systemrCPython27PyScripter.exe python27 argv[1]     elif shebang.split[1] in python3,python3.3         systemrCPython33PyScripter.exe python33 argv[1] else     systemrCPython27PyScripter.exe python27 file.close exit codepre  pI then compiled the program using py2exe and selected is as standard operation for .py files. When I open a .py file now, PyScripter opens the file using the correct version of python, but when i try to save the file it saysp  precodeError saving file CUsers...Pythonexample.py. Error Cannot create file CUsers...Pythonexample.py. The process cannot acces the file because it is being used by another process codepre  pThe compiled program for opening PyScripter is still running, but even if i kill it it still brings that message. Same thing happens with a cmd.exe window opened by the program. If i try to deleterenamemove the file in Windows Explorer it say i cant do it, because the file is currently being used by PyScripter.exe. Does anybody know how to solve thisp  pThe program to open PyScripter is Python 2.7, since i dont have py2exe for Python 3.p

Negative 743 pI have implemented a complex view using SWTJFace and unfortunately I have been using a lot of static members for different elements. Now I want to refactor those elements to instance variables, but also a lot of external classes and methods rely on those. p  pFor example a codeTreeViewercode in this View was declared static and I had a simple static codegetTreeViewercode method implemented, which was called e.g. by a JFace Action, again statically. It worked fine.p  pSo I was thinking about implementing akindofgetter method for my view class extending codeorg.eclipse.ui.part.ViewPartcode. I hoped that this way, I could be able to return the instance of this View, which is in a runtimeEclipse, to the external classes if needed, and this way the actual values of the the previously static now instance fields could be accessed.p  pBut now, without the static fields and methods, I either have to use new keyword to be able to call the nonstatic methods, which will obviously result in an NPE, because there wont be any codecreatePartControlcode method called. Or I should be able to return the already instantiated view somehow And this is where I lack How should be a returnmethod look like for an entire View so its internal can be accessed in their actual state Is there a simple way to do that Thanksp

Negative 743 pThere are a lot of good resources for REST APIs here on SO, and Ive read dozens of them. That being said, I need some help figuring out how to manage state correctly.p  pI have a REST API and then an application which accesses it via cURL and AJAX. Although not terribly important, both are written with the a hrefhttpwww.laravel.com relnofollowLaravel Frameworka. The application does not have any direct database interactions, everything is done through the API. p  pUsing a common blog example fictional, lets say I have a user logged in via OAuth and they want to add a tag to a blog post. I need to post the following information to the API endpointp  precode Access Token User ID is retrieved from this  Post ID  Tag Value codepre  pThis isnt a emlotem of information, but there is a critical piece the strongPost IDstrong. When I receive that information on the API side, I need to do several thingsp  precode1 Does Post with ID x exist  2 Can user edit post with ID x 3 Does tag already exist If so grab it. If not, create it. 3 Update post. codepre  pNow, I could send all that data and perform all those functions in a single call  or I could make separate calls  the first sucks for scaling and the second sucks for performance. This is a simple example, and my application is highly complex with a lot of different rolespermissions and hierarchies to validate.p  pEssentially what this boils down to is because I do not manage any state on the API side, each time a request is made I have to reverify a whole series of values which ends up being dozens of queries. I cant rely on the values being correct because a an affluent user could easily modify hidden form inputs or even devise a JSON request and post it effectively compromising the data.p  pOn this a hrefhttpswww.owasp.orgindex.phpRESTSecurityCheatSheet relnofollowOWASP REST security recommendationsa page, under the section titled Protect Session State, they suggest caching the emblobem of information on the API server side and passing a session token instead. To me this goes against the stateless principles of REST, but then again, its more like a cache so can be recalculated if necessary.  p  pstrongTLDR How is state managed in complex API Driven applications to avoid having dozens of repeated queries on each request and complex sets of input data that the user could modify at any point and compromise the applicationstrongp

Negative 743 pI am struggling with a problem. The more I investigate and debug it, the more I think that I might not understand it completely.p  pMy timezone is ET UTC 5. The hour is somewhere between 2100 and 2159. The date is March 8th 2014. In this timezone, DST happens on March 9th 2014 when 15959 becomes 30000. p  pI want to persist the current date time as a codeTimestampcode in the DB with Hibernate. For this I use Jadiras PersistentDateTime class. I persist UTC values, so Jadira changes the current date time lets say March 8th 2014 2130 ET to March 9th 2014 0230 UTC which is correct. Then it constructs a codeTimestampcode from the string representation of the UTC date time and the codeTimestampcode is code09MAR14 03.30.00.000000000 AMcode. When I go back to the ET representation, I get March 8th 2014 2230 ET. p  pAs far as I understand, this is wrong  I should get the same date time. p  pIt seems to me, that when creating a codeTimestampcode, DST is applied, although it should not be. I am considering one detail ET is UTC 5. 2100 is exactly the hour when DST occurs in ET minus 5 hours. So 2130 ET is 230 UTC. 230 is an invalid our in ET, on March 8th. Maybe this has to do with the strange behavior.p  pI am using jadira 1.9 usertype.jodatime1.9.jar and usertype.spi1.9.jar and Hibernate 3.6.0.

Negative 743 pI need some help thinking about an algorithm.p  pI have a collection of documents, potentially numbering in the millions.  These documents are also indexed in MySQL.  In extreme cases, this index needs to be rebuilt.  Given the large number of documents, the reindexing needs to happen in most recent to least recent.  But more importantly, the reindexing needs to start over again at the same point after a computer reboot or equiv.  And given that index a million documents can take a long time, new documents might be added during the reindexing.p  pThis same collection could be mirrored to another server.  I would like to have an auditor that would make sure that all documents exist on the mirror.p  pIn both cases users will be accessing the system, so I cant tie up to many resources.  For the first case, I would very much like to get an ETA when it would finish.p  pI feel these are the same problem.  But I cant get my head around how to do it efficiently and cleverly.p  pThe brute force approach would be to have a list of the millions of documents  timestamp they were last checkedindexed.  I would then pull the next one out of the list, checkindex it, update the timestamp when done.  p  pThis seems wasteful.p  pWhats more, given that a document might be added to the system but the list not adequately updated, wed have to have an auditor that would make sure all documents are in the list.  Which is the basic problem we are trying to solve.p  pIve seen such an auditor described in multiple situations, such as large nosql setups.  There must be description of clever ways of solving this.p

So I have implemented it this wayp  precodepublic class doubleClickListener implements IDoubleClickListener      public void doubleClickDoubleClickEvent event               Object obj  event.getSource         if obj instanceof TreeViewer                       TreeViewer eventSrc  TreeViewer obj             ITreeSelection selec  ITreeSelection eventSrc.getSelection             if selec  null ampamp selec.isEmpty ampamp selec instanceof IStructuredSelection                               IStructuredSelection selection  selec                 Object item  selection.getFirstElement                               if eventSrc.getExpandedStateitem                                       eventSrc.collapseToLevelitem, AbstractTreeViewer.ALLLEVELS                                   else                                       eventSrc.expandToLevelitem, 1                                              codepre  pIs there an enhancement to my above code I mean is creating an object of ItreeSelection and checking that object is an instaceof IStructuredSelection the right way to do If not what could be the right way to check instanceof IStructuredSelectionp

Negative 743 pIve just written the first version of a workflow activity that will run Resharpers Code Issues on the projects and parse the output to display the issues as build warnings and errors.p  pAt first, I was going to just call a hrefhttpwww.jetbrains.comresharperfeaturescommandline.html relnofollowResharpers command linea and parse the resulting xml manually. After fiddling with the dlls in a hrefhttpswww.nuget.orgpackagesJetBrains.ReSharper.SDK8.2.1158 relnofollowResharpers SDKa through disassembly mostly, I found a way to parse the results using its own public classes, which I figured was a much more elegant and safe way to do this.p  pThe first problem I have is that that nuget package is absolutely emhugeem. There is 140mb of files in there, which to me is absurd for a single, unpartitioned package. There seems to be such heavy coupling between them that by using just a few model classes and the parser class, I have to drag a dozen or so of those dlls along, some of them which seemingly have nothing to do with the main dlls I need. This is not a show stopper though, Im struggling with something else nowp  pIn the end, I managed to track down the dependencies I needed to 41 assemblies which is, again, insane, but alas. Initially, I tried removing everything and adding the missing references one by one, but this turned out to be unreliable, still missing some indirect references, even after compiling successfully. Then, I decided to code a small console application to find all referenced assemblies in the main Resharper assemblies I used, which gave me the 41 references I mentioned. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma13050431946412This is the code I useda to find every dependency.p  pSince these are custom activities we are talking about, I decided to create a unit test project to validate them. Using these 41 references only, everything works correctly.p  pWhen I added the activity to the build workflow though, and pointed the build controller to the source control folder containing the required assemblies, every time I schedule a build, the process fails stating that I need one extra dll from Resharpers SDK. For example, this is the first one it asksp  precodeCould not load file or assembly AsyncBridge.Net35, PublicKeyTokenb3b1c0202c0d6a87 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. type FileNotFoundException codepre  pWhen I add this specific assembly to the TFS folder, I get another similar error for another dll, and this keeps going on and on.p  pWhat I wanted to know is how can I know exactly which assemblies a workflow XAML will need in order to run correctly My custom activity dll has two specific codeCodeActivitiescode and a XAML only activity that uses these two. This XAML acticity is what Im directly using in the modified workflow template.p  pI see that besides the references in my project, the XAML activity also contains a codeTextExpression.ReferencesForImplementationcode section, with some assembly names. Ive run my dependency finder program on those dependencies too, and the results are the same 41 assemblies already at the TFS folder.p  pMeanwhile Ill go with having the whole SDK into the custom assemblies folder, but I would really like to avoid this in the future since it has such an enormous amount of unneeded and big dlls in there.p

Negative 743 pIm going to try to ask a couple design questions without any actual code since Id have to improvise the code and probably make errors in it, for one thing. p  p[Pseudocode at bottom may help.]p  pI have a tool written entirely in VBA, using Excel as a front end, which I want to move part of to VB.Net to take advantage of multithreading. And what I want to ask about is how class or method declarations namely static  shared  singleton might affect the multithreading performance. p  pHere is the bottleneck I want to improve in VBA I have a dictionary containing instances of my own DealObject. I ForEach through the dictionary, and call a Revalue method in each DealObject. The Revalue method takes a DataObject as an argument the same instance is reused on each Deal. The Revalue method also instantiates a PricerObject internally, calls a PricingFunction method in the PricerObject, passing the DataObject and the DealObject itself as parameters. The PricerObject methods wrap declarations to functions in a C dll. p  pIn short, my attempt to improve now is to change my ForEach DealObject to a Parallel.ForEach call. I am moving the DealObject, DataObject, and PricerObject to VB.Net. And putting the new multithreaded loop in a new VB.net DealSetObject, which contains a dictionary of deals and the Parallel.ForEach loop. p  pMy question is whether without seeing codesorry, its just not there yet there are any clear design choices to optimize the multithreadingp  pThe valuation functions basically have the form of DealObject  DataObject  PricingFunction  result. Does it hurt the multithreading advantage to have all the pricing calls use the same DataObject instance Does it help that the pricing function calls only readonly properties in the DataObject. p  pShould the PricerObject be a singleton Or is it good for each DealObject to instantiate its own PricerObject with all instances pointing to the same C dll Would it be better to instantiate PricerObjects outside of the DealObjects, on each loop iteration p  pNote that there is substantial overhead in populating the DataOject, with inputting and processing. The PricerObject retains no data internally. p  pI suspect my description of the design may be hard to read, maybe a bit of pseudo code would help.

Negative 743 pFor academic purposes I have adapted PBRT so that it writes out data about intersections and general path related data I used the path surface integrator. p  pThere is however some difficulty in getting the RGB value of a spectrum at a certain intersection. It is pretty obvious that I have to use codeToRGBfloat rgbcode on the Spectrum class generated at a intersection, but the data observed afterwards is a bit strange. It would make sense for the RGB values to reside between a 01 range. This seems to be the case often, but at times I also see triplets such asp  precode1.851088, 0.882869, 0.772866 codepre  pUpon closer inspection, it turns out that the max values for RGB for my set of roughly 400.000 intersections are 3.77 2.00 and 1.76. The lower bound do seem correct as they are close to zero. So the question is what is the range used by PBRT so that I might transform it to 0.0  1.0. p  pThank youp

Negative 743 pWe currently have a solution were we are having more and more the need to store unstructured data of various kinds. For example clients have the ability to define their own workflows where they define what kind of data should be captured of various types...some simple some complex. This data then needs to be stored and are then displayed on a web application with a bit of functionality to modify the data.p  pUntil now the workflows have been defined internally and therefore a MS SQL database was designed to cater for these specific workflows and their data. However now that clients have the ability to define workflows we need to relax the structure of our db. At first I thought that a key value table in ms sql might be a good idea but obviously I loose the typeness of the data being capture and then need to deserialize all the data in websiteMVC.NET.  I am also considering something like raven db but are not sure if this would be a good fitp  pSo my question  is thus what would be the best way to store this unstructured data bearing in mind users must be able to search and editdisplay this data as wellp

How can I fix this to ensure that the tsvector column uses unaccented charactersp

However, the database contains multiple settings which can be environment specific different values for Production and Acceptance, for example.

Negative 743 pI have multiple stored procedures calling multiple stored procedures in my database. To give a small example, Ive constructed a fictionalised version of a few of them below. In my example, a Java program calls codecalculatebillcode, which calls codecalculatecommissioncode, which calls codeupdaterecordcode.p  pIm hoping to get some advice on how best to propagate the error messages up the stack to the calling Java layer, so the user gets a precise error message corresponding to wherever the error has occurred.p  pIm really quite stuck on this.

So Id like the first four items in Frequency2 to be the corresponding item in the Frequency column divided by the total number of people who said Housing Prices were a major cost 61 and then multiplied by 100 to give a percent.

But the difficulty is that what I want is the drop down menus to be dynamic and update themselves based on the previous selection, so when a user selects a film, the showing drop down only shows showings for that film, when the showing is selected the screen drop down only shows the screen that showing is in, and then the screen drop down menu is used so that the seats drop down only shows seats that are in that screen.p  pI have so far enabled the user to search for a screen and then when they click search the seats available are shown on the seatsindex.html.erb.p  pThis was done using the partial bookinglookup.html.erbp  precodelt formtag mypath, methodgtpost, multipart gt true do gt  lt selecttag screenid,      optionsfromcollectionforselectscreens, id, screensinfo, 0 ,     prompt gt Screen gt    lt submittag Search gt lt end gt codepre  pWhich is displayed on the layoutsapplication.html.erbp  precodelt renderpartial gt bookinglookup, localsgt film gt films  Film.all, showings gt showings  Showing.all, screens gt screens  Screen.all, seats gt seats  Seat.all, mypath gt seatsdisplayseatsbyscreen  gt codepre  pAnd links to the codedisplayseatsbyscreencode in the seatscontrollerp  precode    def displayseatsbyscreen     seats  Seat.screensearchparams[screenid]     if seats.empty          assign a warning message to the flash hash to be displayed in          the div feedbacktop         flash.now[alert]  There are no films of that genre.          return all products, in alphabetical order         seats  Seat.all     end     render action gt index end codepre  pWhich uses the codescreensearchcode in the seat.rb modelp  precodedef self.screensearchsearchstring     self.wherescreenid  , searchstring end codepre  pSo essentially for the above before the user selects the screen they should have selected a showing and before that a film so that only screens for that showing are shown so they can select an appropriate seat.p  pThe models associations filmp  precodehasmany showings belongsto certificate belongsto category codepre  pshowingp  precodebelongsto film hasmany bookings belongsto screen codepre  pscreenp  precodehasmany seats codepre  pseatp  precodebelongsto screen hasmany bookings codepre  pCan anyone helpp

Negative 743 pFirst time here, so excuse me if I am not asking this in the correct way. I have tried using grep rL and variants of find and xargs, but nothing does quite what I am looking for. I would like to identify which subfolders approx 500 do not have any file with the string ObjectDatetrue  they are all xml files. p  pThank youp  pThank you for your help. Maybe I can put it better. I have approx 500 subfolders of one directory. There is no subfolders of these subfolders. Nearly all of the folders contain multiple xml files with the string ObjectDatetrue. I want to identify which subfolders do not contain any xml files with the string ObjectDatetrue. p  pThe command below shows me what files do not contain the string. There are too many results from this so I would like to know what folders have no files that contain that string.p  pgrep rL ObjectDatetrue prodhelogdwsUsremem.xmlp
Negative 743 pI am sorry if the title if complicated but I had a hard time expressing what I want to do.p  pHere my problemp  pI have several thousand images that I want to process. They are split in 120 folders where the folder name indicates their taxa. Each image in the folder has a name which is a number.p  pInstead of processing all 120 folders separately I would like to mix all the pictures from the 120 folders in order to process them all in one batch.p  pWhen I process the images I extract some parameters leading to a .csv file where each row is one of the images. One of the columns is the image name, so the number is there to identify which row comes from which image.p  pIf I process all images together I would have to find a way to label the rows again after processing based on which folder they came from. Again, the image name is in the .csv file for identification.p  pSo I guess one could write a command that stores the original structure of which images were in which folders. Something like linking the image name to the folder name indicating the taxon and adding that back to each row in the .csv file based on the column with the image name.p  pOr maybe there is something totally different and easierp  pMy setup isp  pI am on Mac Yosemite, with the .csv tables etc in Office for Mac x64. Maybe R would be helpful to have a solution I am not a God in R, but okay.p  pThe files are as follow A folder name could be just like species x for example and the image name 100.bmpp  pAfter mixing all images, processing them and exporting them I get the .csv file with 30k rows including the column with the image name 100. So, how can I attach the folder name back based on the image namep  pThanks very much for your input. To find a way around this will safe me lots of point and click with buggy software.p  pBest, Moritzp

Negative 743 pIm new to Minecraft modding just started picking up some tutorials today and somewhat a beginner to Java about 7 months experience.p  pThe tutorial I am specifically following is this one right here and I marked the current relevant time a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvfhhMoxKSkssampt335 relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvfhhMoxKSkssampt335ap  pIm trying to localize the names of the items so that it shows as Table instead of item.ItemTable.name in the game. I think the problem is that he is giving the tutorial in Eclipse while I am using IntelliJ Idea. In my head there is some extra step I need to do because of this. I launched the project in Eclipse without making any further changes to find that it DOES in fact work in Eclipse. However, I do not prefer that IDE.p  pScreenshot img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJ45ov.png althttpi.imgur.comrOGMFVg.png1 Directory tree on left, and enUS.lang file opened on the rightp  pWhen I run the Minecraft client in IntelliJ, the name of the item remains unlocalized, but in Eclipse it does change.p  pThere must be a missing step here thats staring me in the face. I was just hoping someone could point it out to me since I cant find the solution anywhere. Thanks in advancep
Negative 743 pim facing an issue with a Minizinc code that have to schedule some exams in available rooms and periods. I skip the entire problem and code, because ive just a problem in the definition of this soft constraint p  pemsome exams are targeted as exclusive or not, meaning that they need a room for just themselves, this is a soft consraint, so i need to minimize its number of violations. In fact each exam scheduled in the same room and period of an exam requiring a dedicated room counts as one violation.emp  pThe data and variables useful for this constraint are p  ul liemExamsem the number of exams to be scheduledli liemroomexclusiveem a vector of boolean that stands for the exclusivity required by each examli liemroomassignmentem a variable vector of the assigned room to each examli liemperiodassignmentem a variable vector of the period assigned to examsli liemroomexclusivityem an int vector that counts the exclusivity violations for each examsli liemroomexclusivityviolationsem the total number of violations.li ul  pFor example if four exams share the room, and two of them require a dedicated room, the total number of violations is six. Each of those two has three other exams in the same room.p  pIve thought to make a two cycle control on each exam in order to find first an exclusive exam and then to check if it shares its room and period with other exams.

Negative 743 pBasically I want to accomplish this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21212113conversionbetween2templatetypesConversion between 2 template typesap  pBut I want the assignment operator or copy constructor to be specialised.p  pFor example, I have a color classp  precodetemplatelttypename T  floatgt class color  public     T r     T g     T b     T a      colorT R, T G, T B, T A      rR, gG, bB, aA            codepre  pGenerally, color components are needed as codefloatcodes between code0code and code1code. However, its often easier to provide the components as numbers between code0code and code255code because thats generally what you get in Photoshop or GIMP.p  pSo, Id like instances of this class to be able to convert between a codefloatcode and an codeintcode typep  precodecolorltintgt c1255,234,122,14 colorltfloatgt c2  c1 codepre  pAnd when it does this, the numbers in codec1code are divided by code255code to get the code0code to code1code equivalent.p  pSo Ive done this so farp  precodetemplatelttypename Ugt colorltTgtcolorltUgt c  rc.r255.0, gc.g255.0, bc.b255.0, ac.a255.0   codepre  pBut this would also divide a codefloatcode instance by 255 as well. I cant figure out how to specialise this constructor or assignment operator to only be valid for codeintcode to codefloatcode specialisations.p

No converter issues also thank you BalusC and OmniFaces .p  pThe issue is when the session expires or I run the project again, the selectonemenu has no selected value it stays in Portuguese, the first option. So if before I rerun the project I selected Italian for example,when I run it again the site is in Italian, the attribute on LocaleManager where I store the selected language idiomaselecionado is Italian, but the selected option on selectonemenu is Portuguese. I already checked the toString representation of the entities, and they match. I also implemented hselectOneMenu and have the same behavior. Also implemented a pcommandLink the does the same, and they correctly mark the selected on the selectonemenu just like very one does. But the rerunsessionexpire behavior still occurs.p  pProbably this is due to lack of experience on my part, but I tried other ways to do this returning String on CookieHelper method for example but no avail. Also scoured the web for people with this issue but could not find anything like it.p  pSorry for my long post, but Im new to SO and could not find a more succinct way to explain my problem.p  pThank you in advance.p  pRafael Oliveirap  pEDIT Same behavior when refresing page F5 or CtrlR.

Now the only thing I have to do in my code is use another table and i get a translated version of my model in php it could be done by adding a simple trait to your model. With SQL server and Mysql you can use updateable views which save the values in the referenced tables.p  pI love to hear what you guys think of the idea, and most of all what the biggest cons are of using views for this problem p  pKind regards, Bingp

Negative 743 pI am creating a workbook that will copy and paste data from a source worksheet to multiple other worksheets depending upon values in a column. However, once I start the macro, Excel enters a not responding state. I am operating on anywhere from 4000 to 500,000 rows, but only 4 columns. When I only have 4000 rows, it works pretty fast 3 seconds. When I have 30,000 rows, Excel enters a not responding state for 10 seconds, but then finishes. I didnt wait long enough for the 300,000 row test.p  pMy thought process to do this would be to sort all of the data based upon the strings in column codeBcode, put all of column codeBcode which contains the strings I am searching though into an array, then pull all of the unique strings out into another array. For example, if column codeBcode held Search in rows 1200, and Create in rows 201500, the macro will search through the rows and the second array lets call it Scenario would end up holding two values, Search and Create.p  pDuring the searching, I also created two parallel arrays that correspond with the Scenario array which would hold the beginning and ending rows for that scenario. After that, I would just loop through the values in the parallel arrays and copypaste from the source worksheet to the other worksheets.p  pemNOTEem The sort works finep  pIs there a way to make this fasterp  pHere is the code Allocate Datap  precodeSub AllocateData  Dim scenarioRange As String             To hold the composite range Dim parallelScenarioName As String    Holds the unique scenario names Dim parallelScenarioStart As Long     Holds the starting row of the scenario Dim parallelScenarioEnd As Long       Holds the ending row of the scenario  Sheetsraw.Activate                  Raw is the source worksheet  Populates the parallel scenario arrays Call GetScenarioListparallelScenarioName, parallelScenarioStart, parallelScenarioEnd  Loops through the scenario parallel array and coes the copy and paste to other worksheets Workseets are named the same as the scenarios For intPosition  LBoundparallelScenarioName To UBoundparallelScenarioName  1     scenarioRange  A amp parallelScenarioStartintPosition amp  amp D amp parallelScenarioEndintPosition     RangescenarioRange.Select     Selection.Copy      WorksheetsparallelScenarioNameintPosition.Activate      RangeA1.Select     ActiveSheet.Paste     Sheetsraw.Activate Next  End Sub codepre  pGetScenarioListp  precodeSub GetScenarioListByRef parallelScenarioName As String, ByRef parallelScenarioStart As Long, ByRef parallelScenarioEnd As Long Dim scenarioName As Variant Dim TotalRows As Long Dim arraySize As Long arraySize  1  Prep the parallel array for scenario name with the first value ReDim parallelScenarioStart1 ReDim parallelScenarioName1 parallelScenarioStart0  1                First spot on the scenario start will be row 1  Prep the first scenario name Sometimes a number will be attached on the end of the scenario name delimited by a period.

Negative 743 pstrongTLDR  What is the best way to remember constant strings throughout the app and keep them organizedstrongp  pIm using the codeParsecode framework and I often find myself struggling to remember the exact name of some of my fields for my codePFObjectscode. And even if I do, Im not foolproof.p  pSo Ive come up with the codedefinecode statements but I feel like theyre just not it. I have a codeConstants.hcode file where I have about 50 codedefinescode, that are kind of long, but it does what I want  replace my hardcoded string with... other hardcoded strings but more organized in a single file.p  pSo now I have my codePClassnameFieldnamecode strings all over the place but I feel like its not it.p  pIs there a better way to do thatp  pIm fiddling around with a base class codePBaseClasscode that has the 3 base fields codeobjectIdcode, codecreation datecode amp codeupdate datecode, and all of my object classes with their respective fields, that inherit from the base class.p  pBut Im not sure if thats the right way and how to really implement it well anyway to have properties good idea always return the same string.p  pAlso if the solution could provide a safety net to avoid mixing fields betweens classes which codedefinecode doesnt provide, thatd be awesome. codeObjectAFieldAcode shouldnt compile if I need codeobjectBfieldAcode even if the string is the samep  pSo this is 100 of a refactoring problem, and Id like to hear your suggestions p

Negative 743 pThis seems to be a topic that has been asked several times before but im really struggling to find a succinct explanation.

Negative 743 pI have an android device which is configured as a wireless hotspot. I want to find out how I can listen to Probe Requests from devices using Android APIs.p  pI know this can be done by using various tools but only when you have root access. I believe we should also be able to listen to Probe Requests without the root access. This is because, when we set the phone in hotspot mode it is able to connect to other devices without being in root mode. In order to make a connection, the hotspot device must be processing Probe Requests that it receives from other devices.p  pI have tried looking in procarpnet file but it only shows information about devices which are connected to the hotspot.p  pIf its not possible without the root access then I would like to know how an hotspot enabled device is able to accept connections without being in root modep

Negative 743 pright now Im working on an app that heavily relies on Geofencing API. It works fine, however sometimes when I leave phone on my desk, I sometimes receive falsepositive callbacks. Probably because I switch between 3G antennas or something. p  pMy idea was to detect user movement. If user is not moving and I receive message that he left the area  Ill know its wrong. Unfortunately I cant rely on location services, because apparently LocationManager and Geofencing API are giving me weird data.  Sometimes when I enter an area and trigger codegetLastLocationcode, its few kilometers away. Sometimes when Im notified about leaving the area... Location Services are informing me that Im still where I should. So yea  cant really rely on that. p  pIs there some kind of callback, notification or whole library for receiving notification of some sorts that phone is moving From accelerometer or gyroscopep  pYes, I could micro manage that, because my app already has a service... but Id like to avoid heavy battery drainage. p
Negative 743 pIve been trying and searching about a small issue I have in our php application. We use a which to find the full path of a program, however it returns withp  precodewhich no bla in null codepre  pon Centos, on our own debian boxes it works just fine. Ive figured out since then that obviously the PATH is not available in the shell from PHP. But what I cant find out is why that is the case. Ive replaced the command with all sorts of commands to find out what the environment is in which I run in.p  pIf I run an echo PATH I actually see the directories Ive set in the .bashprofile. If I run echo SHELL I know I am using bash, if I run whoami I found out I am not the apache user but a different user, whom I changed the .bashprofile for. As Ive read theres a difference between shells, so I thought it might not load the .bashprofile so Ive also added the export PATH to the .bashrc.p  pI can get it to work with a change in the code, I could replace the which, but I am just genuinely interested in why this is not working on this centos configuration. Ive now added an export PATH in the exec function before the which and it works, and should also work on other systems, but still I think it shouldnt be necessary.p  pAnyone know what could cause this behaviourp

Negative 743 pThe question is based on the premise that the dimension of a list can be determinedi.e. we accepted that a list of list is 2D and a list of list of list is 3D etc.p  pAccording to the a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiDimension relnofollowinformal definition on the wiki pagea, the dimension of a mathematical space or object[Here is data structure] is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it.p  pSo the dimension of a list depends on how many layers of sublist it contains. What about an abstract tree I believe the term codedepthcode is used for an abstract tree, which is similar to the idea of dimension of list.p  pSo is dimension of an abstract tree equal to the depth of an abstract tree.

Negative 743 pOn a project in Xcode 7 I have a few codeSKSpriteNodescode that move back and forth on the screen and another one, called codeusercode, that is meant to jump from sprite to sprite, progressively up the screen. However, when codeusercode lands on one of the moving sprites the moving sprite just slides right out from under it and codeusercode falls back down. I thought that this meant that I needed to increase the friction property on the nodes so that codeusercode would stick to the nodes, but this just makes it bounce on the other nodes.

Negative 743 pI am implementing Lowes method, SIFT, for finding and describing features in an image.p  pI have found interest points, and now I have to describe them Using Lowes method, I have calculated the magnitude and gradient in an area around the keypoint, and created a Gauss weighted histogram, with 36 bins, each corresponding to an orientation of 10 degrees. For each keypoint, there is a histogram. Each bin is the sum of the weighted magnitude, in that direction. An example taken from aishack.in a hrefhttpwww.aishack.instaticimgtutsiftorientationhistogram.jpg relnofollowhttpwww.aishack.instaticimgtutsiftorientationhistogram.jpgap  pBins within 80 the size of the maximum bin, is made a new keypoint. After describing, it says in the paper Finally, a parabola is fit to the 3 histogram values closest to each peak to interpolate the peak position for better accuracy. I am not sure i get this. p  pIn my understanding, it means the peak, the left, and the right value of that peak, will have a parabola fit, like thisbe warned Drawn free handp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com7V8pb.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.com7V8pb.jpgap  pand the orientation of the keypoint will be where the extremum of the parabola  is. For instance If the parabola fitted at 1019, 2029, and 3039 with 2029 being the histogram peak, had extremum at a point, that reached in the 3039, then this would be the orientation of that keypoint. Am i understanding this correctly In this way, the orientation of the keypoint, can only be within 36 orientationsp  pAnother option Same idea as above, only the histogram is no longer discrete the extremum of the parapola will thus be a continuous value, and this value is assigned to the keypoint.p
