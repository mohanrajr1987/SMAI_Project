Positive 34297 pI am very new to Java as well as Apache POI. I need help to read the following excel sheet and grab a specific row as a value to the HashMap. I need to use each cell of the headerrow 0 as a key for the hash map. And for the value I need row that has been matched based on the the user Description provided. Suppose if Male40 has been passed as a parameter, then I want each cell of row 9 to be the respective value of the hashmap key.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comtU1HM.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtU1HM.png altenter image description hereap  pThis is how I did with JXl.

Positive 34297 pIm trying to write a code that finds a certain column in an input Excel file and reorganizes it in an output excel file. Ive gotten the for loop completed and it works. However, when I try to set up a similar for loop for the next condition it removes the column it had written before in the previous if statement. I cant seem to figure out why this occurs.

Positive 34297 pIve written a code that takes in data from one input excel file and writes a new output file with the desired organization. The problem Im encountering is that it when I open the Java file only the column that was the latest within the for loop has data. I have tested to see if my for loop is wrong by breaking the for loop at different times. The tests show that it does write the correct data in the correct column.

Negative 34297 pIll be quick and honest Im currently trying to write a clientserver for an online game. Since Im poor and limited on resources, Ill be testing the bare basics of the server using a PHP backend, with the eventual goal being to rebuild the server end in C.p  pIm looking for a C library for Windows XP and Vista preferably that will let me use a finite number of threads, one dedicated to each piece of the networking problem. As an example, I want to use a thread to report the positional information of the player to the server and to receive responses about positional information of the other players but I want a different thread to background download in the 3D artwork for the areaplayers, and a different thread for the built in chat system, etc. These all need to be fairly independent of one another.p  pI know what I want to emdoem with the library, Ive got the design bit figured out, I just feel a bit silly reinventing the wheel, since I know that a good library for this exact purpose probably already exists. So, what are your suggestions I need to be able to send data to a server, and accept responses. Ideally, the request needs to trigger an Event when its done so I can immediately grab the data and do something with it and I need to be able to handle multiple transactions simultaneously. HTTP is a nice bonus, but I can handle HTTP protocol myself if necessary, especially considering that I plan on dropping it in the long run.p  pThanksp

Negative 34297 pIm writing some optimized C code that basically runs through an array and does something to each element. What it does depends on the current value of the element so something likep  precodefor i0 i lt alen i      if a[i]  0          a[i]  f1a[i]      else if a[i]  2  0          a[i]  f2a[i]      else          a[i]  0  codepre  pIm returning to C after many years working in dynamic languages, where my practice has been to try to write straightforward code and not create lots of local variables for things that I can just refer to directly, like a[i] above.  emI am very much aware that best practices are to write readable code and trust that the compiler is smarter than you and will do good optimizations.emp  pIf I were writing the code above in assembler, I would load a[i] into a register once and then just use that value each time because I know that a[] is private memory and wont change between references.  However, even a smart compiler might do a load every time because it cant be sure that the memory hasnt changed.  Or do I have to explicitly declare a volatile for the compiler to not make this optimization.p  pSo, my question is should I expect better performance by rewriting with a local variable like sop  precodefor i0 i lt alen i      val  a[i]     if val  0          a[i]  f1val      else if val  2  0          a[i]  f2val      else          a[i]  0  codepre  pOr does stuff like O3 take care of this automatically for me  The code Im optimizing takes days to run, so even modest improvements will make a difference.p

Negative 34297 pLets say I have a WCF service that a client can use to receive message from some server side message queue. As an example, lets say there is a serverside queue of email in a data tablep  precodeID  MESSAGETEXT  SENT  1   Hi           N 2   A 2nd Msg     N codepre  pLets define our service asp  precode[OperationContract] public Listltstringgt GetMessages      var messages  LoadMessagesFromDb     var messageText  from m in messages select m.MessageText.ToArray     return messageText  codepre  pLets assume that LoadMessagesFromDb just grabs all the messages where SENT  N. So we load those, and then extract all the text strings and return them.p  pNow my issue here is that I really need to mark those messages as sent  Y in my data table.  I could do something likep  precode[OperationContract] public Listltstringgt GetMessages      var messages  LoadMessagesFromDb     var messageText  from m in messages select m.MessageText.ToArray       mark sent     foreachvar msg in messages         MarkSentInDbmsg.ID      return messageText  codepre  pHowever, what happens if there is an error in returning the data to the client Possibly a connectivity issue, or a WCF serialization issue  What Id really like to do is somehow know that the client received the message successfully.  The only thing I can think of right now is make a 2nd method that the client can call to indicate that the items were received successfullyp  precode[DataContract] public class Message      [DataMember]     public long ID  get set       [DataMemeber]     public string Text  get set   codepre  pthen have a 2nd method on the servicep  precode[OperationContract] public ListltMessagegt GetMessages  [OperationContract] public void ConfirmMessagesReceivedListltlonggt messageIds codepre  pSo the client would have to send all the IDs back to me.  Is there a better way to do this  If I were doing this in ASP.NET instead of WCF, I could have the method open the response stream and write back the data, and have that in a trycatch, but I dont seem to have the same flexibility in WCF, without making a bunch of custom message writers and extensions...  Anyone have a better idea how to tell if there is an error during transmit back to the client Does wsreliablemessaging give me anythingp

Negative 34297 pThe codeSystem.Windows.Documentscode namespace includes a number of classes with an codeInlinescode property of type codeInlineCollectioncode.

Negative 34297 pIf there are any DBAs out there, Im making a fairly large piece of software and one of the biggest issues presently is where to put the business logic.

The main reason is that you can scale your API and website independently of each other.p  pAdditionally, Rails has a lot of middleware that is not required for stateless services e.g. sessions, cookies, view rendering, etc.... Jeff Dean has a good write up on how to remove all of this middleware a hrefhttppivotallabs.comusersjdeanblogarticles1419buildingafastlightweightrestservicewithrails3 relnofollowhttppivotallabs.comusersjdeanblogarticles1419buildingafastlightweightrestservicewithrails3a.p  pAt the moment, I am simply using the new Rails 3 responder respondwith in one single application, both for the website and the API. The website is used mainly for administration purposes.p  pHow would you separate the API from the websitep  pI think an option would be to pack all models in a gem, then have two different applications, one lightweight REST service, and the administration website. They would be hosted on different Heroku instances, but access the same MongoHQ database.p

Negative 34297 pIm trying to create an interactive 3d representation of cells that are defined by the intersection of arbitrary surfaces.  Im having a hard time figuring out how to create a mesh from this or is there something better than a mesh that I should be aiming for to represent 3d volumes.  Each surface s is given by an analytical expression for a plane, sphere, cylinder, cone, etc. as s  fx,y,z  0, such as those here p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOz7qj.png altenter image description herep  pFor each cell I have a list of surfaces and a  sense for each surface.  With this its easy to determine if an x,y,z point lies inside the cell by plugging that point into the equation for each of the bounding surfaces, and if the result is  for all  surfaces and  for all  surfaces the point lies inside.  Obviously if the result is zero for any surface then the point lies on that surface.p  pI can test thousands of grid points, noting for each cell those points that lie inside that cell and then using the outermost of those points to create a mesh for that cell.  However, I have thousands of cells and this simply wouldnt be fast enough.  Many cells are very small or low aspect ratio compared to others, so I would need a very fine grid of points if I was going to do it this way.p  pCan anyone suggest an efficient way of putting cells defined in this way into a static 3d model  Is there any sort of library that works with this kind of geometry specification that can build 3d meshes for me  Am I missing something obviousp  pThanks, Nickp

When I fire up my list, everything works fine in terms of when states are active, such as an item gets focus, is pressed, etc, but the items themselves have a transparent background when none are selected i.e. the default view state.  I had hoped that the last rule of the State List, p  precodeltitem androiddrawabledrawableshaperow gt codepre  pwould capture that state, but for some reason it is not working.  I have moved things around and tried different settings, and nothing.  If I edit the row.xml file which I use to define the list items in the ListView and try to add a specific androidbackground that points to drawableshaperow, every row gets the correct background, BUT on pressed, on focus, etc states fail to process or at least, cant be seen as the background never changes.p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction here  I am SO close to putting this one to bed, but after trying nearly everything, just cant get the ListView items to take a default background AND respond to the implemented State List via androidlistSelector.p  pThanks,p  pPaulp  pEDITp  pAlso just tried adding androiditemBackgrounddrawableshaperow to the ListView in main.xml, and unsurprisingly no luck the docs state it should be used to specify menu items backgrounds, but thought it was worth a shot with list items.p  pAnother thing tried, adding androidvisibletrue to each of the selector and item definitions.  The StateListDrawable docs seem to indicate that the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidgraphicsdrawableStateListDrawable.htmlattrandroid3avisibleProvides initial visibility state of the drawable the default value is falsea, but adding this changed nothing.p  pEDIT2 So, based on the research done below by Qberticus, it seems that there can be only one set of list selectors per view, which confirms the list selector behavior.  I can also confirm that setting the androiddrawSelectorOnTop does move the selector IN FRONT of the selected item, but this of course obscures the item itself such that I only see the selector itself which in my case is a colored shape.p  pHere is what the list looks like with backgrounds setp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnyc0D.png altnormal, unselected list with background setp  pDue to the set background, there is no change in appearance when items are selected.  If I change the androiddrawSelectorOnTop directive to true and select an item, I getp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfejrN.png altselected, with drawSelectorOnTop set to truep  pAnd finally, if I set no background image for the list items, the selector works as expected, but of course, there are no background images as the last rule of the StateSelector does not appear to be followed shouldnt it act as a catchall for nonselected items meaning no nice custom rounded shapesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPpRBS.png altselected, no backgroundp  pSo, my problem remains if I dont set a background for each list item, I can see the selector working BUT the items have no background when not selected.  If I set a background for the item, they look great when not selected, but the background obscures the selector.  Is it simply not possible to have a uniquely shaped list item with working selectorsp  pThanks for anyone else who can weight in.p

Negative 34297 pIve looked at previously answered questions on stackoverflow and also in XPath references and tutorials, but I dont see anything that quite matches my scenario.  Apologies in advance if this is already been asked or if theres a trivial answer that Ive somehow missed.  Also, Im simplifying the situation somewhat to make it more easily understood.  The main point here is that I cant navigate the XML doc programatically and need a oneline XPath solution for reasons I describe at the end.p  pI am working with an XML schema that looks something like the one below.  This is something I have to use asis.p  precodeltRootgt   lt Child 1 gt   ltChildgt       ltNamegtJoeltNamegt       ltAgegt12ltAgegt   ltChildgt   lt Child 2 gt   ltChildgt       ltNamegtMikeltNamegt       ltAgegt25ltAgegt   ltChildgt    lt Child 3 gt    ltChildgt       ltNamegtJaneltNamegt       ltAgegt20ltAgegt   ltChildgt ltRootgt codepre  pAssuming Im already at the Joe node i.e. the Name element inside Child 1, I need to define an XPath query that will wrap that node as followsp  precodeltRootgt   lt Child 1 gt   ltChildgt       ltNamegtJoeltNamegt       ltAgegt12ltAgegt   ltChildgt ltRootgt codepre  pIve tried various combinations of ancestor, stringjoin, concat, etc., but cant seem to find the solution that wraps the element correctly.  The way I was using ancestor was returning emallem Child nodes, for example, which is not what I need.p  pSome other considerations 1 The solution has to be a oneline XPath query, if thats possible for reasons given below. 2 It has to be generic enough to work for any Child element i.e., it cant assume that Im always at the first or second or third child, for example. 3 From the example above, you can see that I dont actually need the actual Root node perse, just its tag i.e. I dont want all Child nodes under it. However, I do need the actual Child node so that I get the Name and Age.  p  pNOTE  For what its worth, I cant actually navigate the XML programmatically.  I am using a library whose code I cannot change in which I have to define everything in terms of oneline XPath queries within a configuration file.  It will essentially navigate through all of the Name elements, so my solution has to work from that point.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 34297 pIm working on some automated build changes and have some questions as to the best approach for buildingpackaging EXE applications.p  pConceptually, there are two scripts.  The first builds everything at puts the resulting binaries on a share so they are available for deployment.  The second set of scripts are each responsible for copying and configuring some application from that build result.p  pThe first script, which builds the entire solution, copies the build result to known pickup location by overriding the msbuild output path.  This causes binaries for all to be dropped in the same folder except web applications, where each project is in its own website under PublishedWebsites.  This is problematic as when I build an installer for a single EXE project, I only want to include the EXE and dependencies of that EXE.

Negative 34297 pI recently came across a requirement in creating an API for an existing web portal. The current web UI will remain as it is and the API will provide the extra functionality for any clients that would like to build apps on top of the core app.p  pThe web ui is pretty complex and consists of several stepbystep forms to achieve the desired functionality. For instance, some domain object is split into a set of form views my viewmodel in a wizardlike fashion. The validation in terms of whether the value entered is an int, whether the email given is valid etc happens on the viewmodel. p  pI was planning to reuse the viewmodel classes to represent the user input in the api. p  pe.g. WebUI public ActionResult SaveFormOne form...      API public ActionResult SaveString apiKey, FormOne form...p  pBut this is so difficult i.e. have a perfect mapping between the WebUI viewmodel and the API viewmodel. p  pWhat constitutes a good design in this casep  pa Create a new viewmodel for the API b Use the existing viewmodel when possible  create new classes where appropriate c Something elsep  pThanks, Yp

But where a project does contain an objecttype, there will be a finite list of instances of that object type.p  pNow what I am trying to do is to find all objects of a given object type that are positioned on top of each other and I know that I will only be interested in 2 of the object types, and I am assuming that only objects of the same type will be overlayed on each other.  But the objects have been drawn and positioned by hand, so I cant assume that such objects have exactly the same dimensions or position  but I will assume that they will match within some aribtray maximum size difference, so i have this feeling I need to scan and group objects by some sort of fuzzy requirement based on the center location of an object.p  pAnd the can I have a pony too request is that I am only interested in seeing more than one object on top of another.  Within a list of a given object type, there could be a group of objects positioned on top of each other, as well as a bunch of other objects that do not overlap  I dont want to know about those latter objects.p  pSo for a file loaded by an XDocument I am thinking of a 2 pass approach like and I am not sure if I have the correct syntax for Top et al p  precode  var objects  from object in xdoc.Descendants     where object.Name  ObjectType1 or object.Name  ObjectType2      select new            Project  object.AttributeProjectName.Value.ToString,       ObjectType  object.Name,       Index  intobject.AttributeIdx.Value,       Top  intobject.ElementLocation.AttributeTop.Value,       Left  intobject.ElementLocation.AttributeLeft.Value,       Width  intobject.ElementLocation.AttributeWidth.Value,       Height  intobject.ElementLocation.AttributeHeight.Value          var stacked  from object in objects    group object by  codepre  pIts the  bit that I dont know how to write.

For any object type, I expect that there will be a bunch of objects that will be well located over each other but will not overlap with other objects not in the same bunch.  So for objects A, B, C that overlap, You will strongnotstrong have A amp B overlap, B amp C overlap and A amp C not overlapping.  p  pThus A will always overlap B and C, B will always overlap A amp C and C will always overlap A amp B.  However there may be objects D, E and F which are located elsewhere which do not overlap A, B or C or each other, but there may be a third or more group of objects G, H and I which overlap themselves.   p  pSo for a given project, and a given object type, and objects A,B,C that overlap themselves, D, E and F that do not overlap with any other object and G, H and I which overap themselves and no other objects as well Id like to see an output grouped likep  precodeProject   ObjectType1List     Group1       A, B, C     Group2       G, H, I codepre  pIn the actual data there may be many such groups for a given Object type.  p

Negative 34297 pI have an interesting problem, however I dont know quite how to articulate it better than saying I have a subquery that needs to return multiple columns. PostgreSQL throws an error when I attempt to do this, so while my SQL looks somewhat logically sound to me  obviously there is a better way to do this. Im attempting to merge user permissions into one table hoping to throw this in to a view or even a materialized view of sorts. Here are my tablesp  precodeCREATE TABLE users    userid integer NOT NULL,   username character varying32 NOT NULL,   passwd character varying32 NOT NULL,   deptid integer NOT NULL,   lastactivity timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now,   CONSTRAINT pkusersuserid PRIMARY KEY userid   CREATE TABLE groups    groupid integer NOT NULL,   groupname character varying32 NOT NULL,   addposts integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   removeposts integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   modifyusers integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   addusers integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   deleteusers integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   CONSTRAINT pkgroupsgroupid PRIMARY KEY groupid   CREATE TABLE usergroups    userid integer NOT NULL,   groupid integer NOT NULL,   CONSTRAINT fkusergroupsgroupid FOREIGN KEY groupid       REFERENCES groups groupid MATCH SIMPLE       ON UPDATE NO ACTION ON DELETE NO ACTION,   CONSTRAINT fkusergroupsuserid FOREIGN KEY userid       REFERENCES users userid MATCH SIMPLE       ON UPDATE NO ACTION ON DELETE NO ACTION   CREATE TABLE userrights    userid integer NOT NULL,   addposts integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   removeposts integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   modifyusers integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   addusers integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   deleteusers integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   CONSTRAINT fkuserrightsuserid FOREIGN KEY userid       REFERENCES users userid MATCH SIMPLE       ON UPDATE NO ACTION ON DELETE CASCADE  codepre  pand some data to populate themp  precodeINSERT INTO usersuserid, username, passwd, deptid VALUES 1, nicole,123456,12 INSERT INTO usersuserid, username, passwd, deptid VALUES 2, john,324634,11 INSERT INTO usersuserid, username, passwd, deptid VALUES 3, susan,61236,14 INSERT INTO usersuserid, username, passwd, deptid VALUES 4, mary,1213612,2 INSERT INTO userrightsuserid, addposts, removeposts, modifyusers, addusers, deleteusers VALUES 1,0,0,1,1,1 INSERT INTO userrightsuserid, addposts, removeposts, modifyusers, addusers, deleteusers VALUES 2,1,1,1,1,1 INSERT INTO userrightsuserid, addposts, removeposts, modifyusers, addusers, deleteusers VALUES 3,0,0,0,0,0 INSERT INTO userrightsuserid, addposts, removeposts, modifyusers, addusers, deleteusers VALUES 4,0,0,0,0,0 INSERT INTO groupsgroupid, groupname, addposts, removeposts, modifyusers, addusers, deleteusers VALUES 1,Poster,1,1,0,0,0 INSERT INTO groupsgroupid, groupname, addposts, removeposts, modifyusers, addusers, deleteusers VALUES 2,User Mgr,0,0,1,1,1 INSERT INTO groupsgroupid, groupname, addposts, removeposts, modifyusers, addusers, deleteusers VALUES 3,Admin,1,1,1,1,1 INSERT INTO usergroupsuserid, groupid VALUES 1,1 INSERT INTO usergroupsuserid, groupid VALUES 2,2 INSERT INTO usergroupsuserid, groupid VALUES 3,2 INSERT INTO usergroupsuserid, groupid VALUES 4,3 INSERT INTO usergroupsuserid, groupid VALUES 1,2 codepre  pWhat Im trying to do is create a query that can calculate the effective permissions a user might have. Users are stored in the you guessed it users table. Groups in groups, whatever groups a user might be assigned to are in usergroups. Finally, each user can have individual permissions that should override the group permissions  those are stored in  userrights.p  pI can pull a query of all this information using and yes, I know this is uglyp  precodeselect   maxaddposts as addposts,   maxremoveposts as removeposts,   maxmodifyusers as modifyusers,   maxaddusers as addusers,   maxdeleteusers as deleteusers from  select    maxaddposts as addposts,   maxremoveposts as removeposts,   maxmodifyusers as modifyusers,   maxaddusers as addusers,   maxdeleteusers as deleteusers from   groups where   groupid in select groupid from usergroups where userid  3 union all select     maxaddposts as addposts,   maxremoveposts as removeposts,   maxmodifyusers as modifyusers,   maxaddusers as addusers,   maxdeleteusers as deleteusers from    userrights where   userid  3  as combinedusergroups codepre  pWhich given the above data will give me the effective permissions for any user I specify in the WHERE clauses. What I want to do is create a materialized view that is only updated when the user or group data changes, but is otherwise static. This I know how to do with no problem  the problem Im encountering is generating this view. My idea is using the above query  but having it run for each user in the users table and creating a userid column. So my effectivepermissions table would look like thisp  precodeuserid, addposts, removeposts, modifyusers, addusers, deleteusers 1        1          1             1             1          1 2        1          1             1             1          1 3        0          0             1             1          1 codepre  p..and so on. I just cant figure out how to add userid to this result and show multiple rows. I hope I have provided enough information for someone to understand what it is I am trying to do. I realize that ultimately this method can become rather costly performancewise once the tables group in size  and this solution seems to be the best one I can come up with to mitigate that problem.p  pThe examples provided should work if you want to recreate the sample data for testing purposes I just rebuilt it on my local pg server real quick, though its much simpler than the real tables the same concepts apply.p

Negative 34297 pIm beginning the planning phase of creating a testing suite for my rails 3.0.8 application. Im trying to decide on which testing frameworkgems to use.

Negative 34297 pIve written several Android apps, but this is my first experience with 3D programming.p  pIve created a room 4 walls, ceiling and floor with a couple objects inside and am able to move the camera around it as if walking. Ive textured all surfaces with various images and everything was working as expected. p  pFor context, the room is 14 units wide and 16 units deep centered at origin, 3 units high 1 above origin and 2 below. There are 2 objects in the middle of the room, a cube and an inverted pyramid on top of it.p  pThen I went to add a light source to shade the cube and pyramid. I had read through and followed a couple of NeHes ports, so I took what I had working in the lesson on lighting and applied it to my new code.p  precodegl.glEnableGL10.GLLIGHTING gl.glLightfvGL10.GLLIGHT0, GL10.GLAMBIENT, new float[]  0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f, 1f , 0 gl.glLightfvGL10.GLLIGHT0, GL10.GLDIFFUSE, new float[]  1f, 1f, 1f, 1f , 0 gl.glLightfvGL10.GLLIGHT0, GL10.GLPOSITION, new float[]  4f, 0.9f, 6f, 1f , 0 gl.glEnableGL10.GLLIGHT0 codepre  pThe result is that the cube and pyramid are not shaded. They look the same on sides opposing the light as they do on the sides facing it. When the camera is pointed directly away from the light source the room looks as it did before I added the lighting code. As I rotate the camera to face the light source the entire room including objects becomes darker until completely black when the camera is directly facing the source.p  pWhat is going on here I read many articles on lighting and how it works, but I have seen nothing to indicate why this wouldnt light up all sides of the room, with the cube and pyramid shaded based on the light position. Is there some expected behavior of the light because it is inside the room Am I just missing something easy because Im newp

It was giving me an error, since I have older version of pycrypto. p  pWhen I was trying to install latest version I stumble upon Unable to find vcvarsall.bat error. I googled something about MinGW, so I installed that too. Ive added it to my Windows PATH, but now im getting another error, which looks like this command gcc failed no such file or directory. What do i do now Found something about gccmingw, which is some version of MinGW that could help p  pWhy is has to be so damn complicated D.p  hr  pNew development. Managed to install pycrytpo and fabric, but still cant run anything in the latter. New error says ImportError no module named win32api. Quick google search says something about PyWin, but easyinstall cant find it and it looks like its abandoned. Any ideasp

Negative 34297 pI have a collection of some items and some operation on them. This operation is a part of remote calls between client and server and it should run on all items at once.

Negative 34297 pIf you use JPA or another kind of persistence, you probably have a way to save a record that is sent to client via ajax.p  pstrongEDIT  the interface is done with GWT, so all ajax call are classic java method converted to javascript equivalentstrongp  pLets take the class Person which is an entity in database. Person has four fields  codename, birthday, id, emailcodep  pWhen you load a person from server via ajax, you generally send to client a Person object.p  pIn your Person editor, you display the name, the birthday and the email. When the Person object is edited you may want to display the id.p  pThere are two cases  p  ul lisave person  only email can be changed but you can display idli licreate person  email, name and birthday can be changedli ul  pWhen you send the just edited datas to server, whats the way you proceed p  pI see several approaches p  ul lisend a Person object. In this case you must take care of data you persist and not only make the person object you received from client to persist mode because a hacker can send data you may not want to be changed and you cant trust on interface to disabled these changes. In this case, there is several approaches too  ul liuse two functions save and create, create a new Person object on server or load the persisted instance via the id if you are in the save method and copy all fields you want from the client Person object to the persisted oneli liuse one function saveOrCreate and check if id exists. It is equivalent to the above approach by merging the two functions in one with a big ifli ulli lisend datas to the server email, birthday, name, id in case of edit. When you do that, create a new Person object or load the persisted one and copy datas to this persisted instance.li ul  pTo summary you have one of the following method signature just for edit casep  ul licodePerson savePersonPerson personcodeli licodePerson savePersonString id, String emailcodeli ul  pI see pros and cons for each approach. For example the first allow quick change on the Person model without modifying all savePerson calls. But it is less readable than the second approach to know what is really saved.p  pI dont know what is the best one and if you know another way to do that. So, how do you do p

Negative 34297 pIve started some time ago to work with custommade servers, and even though I have experience to deal with the actual message exchange  serialization, etc, of clientserver communications, Ive had never coded an actual server from scratch.  In this sense, I have found raw TCP socket connections to be much trickier and unpredictable than Id like.p  pFor example, I coded a simple clientserver application that would establish a long lived TCP connection, and the clients would receive push notifications from the server. Very simple, it worked very well in my test environment, even with many computers.p  pWhen I actually published this, though, Ive had got lots of errors that later I would found that it was the lack of keepalive signals, which would make the connection to be cut, strongwithout giving me either client or server any feedback  error at allstrong. The messages simply wouldnt be delivered, and fail silently.p  pI knew that TCP could break the connection, but I thought I could at least receive an error or such so I could reconnect in case of loss of connection. This made me very insecure about rolling my own servers, as the possible errors and scenarios seem too many and unexpected, and I really dont want to learn about the unexpected behaviours when the actual application is deployed. With my current experience with serverside programming, the best way to deal with errors would be to enumerate all possible errors, and make sure I cover all exceptional cases when writing a program.p  pSo, is there anywhere I could find a good documentation on the possible pitfalls  exceptions I could find with sockets, with how to detect them Its been some time since I last worked with that, so I dont have any more fresh examples, but I remember that e.g. when you receive an empty message it would mean that the connection broke.p  pId also love to hear suggestions, or maybe simple libs preferrably in C that cover them so I can base my work in it My main platform is linux, but a crossplatform solution is much appreciatedp  pThank youp

Negative 34297 pI want to speed up my django view processing where in the view I have to make several web service calls in my case facebook graph api which really take quite some time to process it takes around 1516 secs just to render a view most of which is spent in getting data from facebook. So instead ofp  precodedef viewrequest     if newuser          facebook graph api call becomes the bottleneck          profile  facebook.graphapicallprofile information      friends  facebook.graphapicallget some more information like friends      some lengthy processing of friends     ...      facebook.graphapicallyet some more information      Finally pass the profile to template to render user details     rendertoresponsemytemplate,  profile profile  codepre  pI thought to dop  precodetask def getprofile     profile  facebook.graphapicallprofile information     return profile  def viewrequest     if newuser          profiletask  getprofile.delay      friends  facebook.graphapicallget some more information like friends      some really lengthy processing of friends     ...      facebook.graphapicallyet some more information      Wait for profile task to complete     profiletask.get      Finally pass the profile to template to render user details     rendertoresponsemytemplate,  profile profile  codepre  pThis way my processing of friends data can proceed without waiting for the profile information to be retrieved. But if the celery workers are busy then it may not fetch the profile data immediately and hence the rendering of view could take more even more time than the previous approach.p  pThe third approach could be to do everything same as in approach 2 but cancel the task if it has already not been started and make a regular function call instead of launching a task to get profile information.p  pJust in case someone suggests to get the profile and friend information using a facebook batch request it is not possible in my case as the code above is just a snippet. I am actually fetching the profile in a middleware when a user first visits my app.p  pI am not sure which approach out of the 3 above is better. Please suggest if there could be some other way to parallelize the web requests.p

Negative 34297 pIm an experienced developer but a relative newbie with Cocoa.  The Cocoa documentation says that toolbar items NSToolbarItem are 32x32 in regular size and 24x24 in small size.  It goes on to say that you can and should include an image that includes both sizes and that a multipage TIFF or an ICNS file can be used.  This is where I am confused.  I have tried several different programs that create ICNS files but all of them create files including 16x16, 32x32, and bigger.  Is the assumption that the 24x24 toolbar icon uses a 16x16 image or is there a way to create a ICNS file with a 24x24 image  Or are people using an application to create multipage TIFF filesp

Negative 34297 pHello fellow developers.p  pFirst of all I apologize beforehand for the wall of text that follows, but after a day going crazy on this, I need to call for help.p  pIve stumbled across a problem I cannot seem to solve. Ill try to describe the scenario in the best possible way.p  pTask at hand in an existing Asp.Net Mvc application, create a lookup table for an integer field, and use the textual value from the lookup in the editing view. When saving, we must first check if the lookup already has a corresponding text value for the same codeRootcode ID. If there is, use that. Otherwise, create it and then use it.p  pThe structurep  pThe data model is a graph of objects where we have the root object, a collection of level A child objects, and every level A child object has a collection of level B child objects, so something like thisp  ul liRoot with fields ul liLevel A child with fields x n ul liLevel B child with fields x nli ulli ulli ul  pThe field we have to handle is on the LevelB objects.p  pThere is a single Mvc view that handles the whole data. For collection objects, all fields are named like codelevelA1levelB1MyFieldcode, codelevelA1levelB2MyFieldcode, etc so every single field has unique name during the post. When the post happens, all values are read through a codeformCollectioncode parameter which has average 120130 keys. The keys are isolated by splitting them and looping on the numerical part of the names, values are read and parsed to the expected types and assigned to the object graph.p  pThe datalayer part backing the object graph is all stored procedures, and all the mapping both object to sproc and sproc to object is hand written. Theres a single stored procedure for the read part, which gets multiple datasets, and the method calling it reads the datasets and creates the object graph.p  pFor the saving, there are multiple sprocs, mainly a CreateRoot and UpdateRoot. When the code has to perform such tasks, the following happensp  ul liFor create scenario, CreateRoot is called, then the sprocs CreateLevelA and CreateLevelB are called in loop for each element in the graphli liFor update scenario, UpdateRoot is called, which internally deletes all LevelA and LevelB items, then the code recreates them calling the aforementioned sprocs in loop.li ul  pLast useful piece of information is that the business objects graph is used directly as a viewmodel in the view, instead of being mapped to a plain html friendly viewmodel. This is maybe what is causing me the most trouble.p  pSo now the textbox on the view handles an integer field. That field must now accept a string. The field on LevelB must remain an integer, only with a lookup table with FK of course and the text field from the lookup must be used.p  pThe approaches I tried with no successp  ul liMy first thought was to change the datatype on the property codeMyFieldcode from integer to string on the object, then change the sprocs accordingly and handle the join at sproc level Id have a consistent object for my view, and the readwrite sprocs could translate from string to integer and viceversa, but I cant do that because the join keys to retrieve the integer when writing are part of the codeRootcode item as I stated in the first lines of this wall of text, which I dont know in the codeCreateLevelBcode sproc, and changing the whole chain of calls to pass those parameters would have a huge impact on the rest of the application, so no good.li liMy next try was to keep things as they are and call some translation methods when reading, pass the integer to the view, and there call the translation method to display the text value. When saving, use the posted text to retrieve the integer. The save part would work, Id have all the parameters I need, but for the read part, Id have to instantiate the data access layer and call its method at View level, and theres no need to explain why that is a very bad choice, so I ruled this out too.li ul  pNow Im out of options or ideas anyway. Any suggestion to solve this is very welcome, and also if something is not clear enough just point it out and I will edit my post with more accurate information.p  pThanks.p

Negative 34297 pA codehastablecode uses some hash function on an object to store.  p  pThis hash function essentially calculates the position of the object in the table.  p  pIf we use a codeHashTablecode or codeHashMapcode and the size can not fit more elements then these collections are resized to accomodate more elements.br This means that each stored element must be rehashed to calculate the new position in the new bigger table.  p  pMy question is the followingthat the above are correctbr I read that codeStringcode calculates its codehashcodecode by using the characters that it stores and additionally that the codehashvaluecode is stored internally cached for best performance since it does not have to be recalculated.  p  pThis is the part I dont get.If the codehashcodecode is based on the characters the codeStringcode stores then how is the position in the codehashtablecode calculated  p  pIs there some extra logic using the codehashcodecode of codeStringcode So the codeStringcodes codehashcodecode is not actually the codehashvaluecode  p

Negative 34297 pWhen writing a method, say, inside one of your DAO objects, and you dont want this method to accept certain input, for discussions sake, say it does not allow null arguments. How do you go about implementing that, taking into account this method is likely to be reused in the future by new team members.p  pThe way I do it isp  ol liIn the interface, I document inside the method javadoc that arguments a, b and c cannot be null.li liInside the method I check for null values first thing, and if any of a, b or c are null then I throw an IllegalArgumentException.li ol  pBut, what if some developer in the future just reads off the method signature and decides that it what heshe needs and starts using it, without paying attention to this detail, and worse testing does not reveal it. NULL pointer exception wont occur and we are getting a useful error message, but we are still getting an error in production that couldve been avoided.p  pIs there a way to enforce this at compile time I doubt it, but what would be the safest and most baddeveloperproof way to go about doing thisp

Negative 34297 pI encountered a problem in c. I read some codes,but there was a very wired usage of pointer. The code is followingp  precode   double marginalProbability     new double [10  sizeofmarginalProbability[0]]    memset marginalProbability, 0, 10  sizeofdouble      ................             .................    ifmarginalProbabilitygt0         printflarger    else         printfsmaller codepre  pThe question Im asking is what does it mean that codeifmarginalProbabilitygt0code. It is a pointer greater than zero. I think that in a normal compiler, there are no addresses which will be equal to zero. Or are there any other meanings of that Otherwise, this line seems meaningless. Thanks.p

Negative 34297 pemstrongEDIT I figured it out, look towards the bottom half of thisemstrongp  pBefore I ask my question, I will state I have successfully used TBXML and RapidXML. Specifically Rapid has parsed this very same document successfully. Im familiar with XML reading and assigning values.p  pThat said, TinyXML and Cocos seems to be a good combination, as it compiles to android. I can go down the nodes ONCE, print out values, see where I am... the problem is thisp  pnode  nodenextSiblingp  pAlways returns false. Ive learned that I can do thisp  pnodeParentNextSibling and this will give me the next sibling instead. But heres a problemp  pParentNodeFirstChild will return the first element of that tree. But if I call ParentNodeNextSibling, for some reason it returns a pointer to the sibling, except its now one level higher on the tree.p  pThis is going to make looping a semi nightmare. p  pIm scouring a hrefhttpgrinninglizard.comtinyxml2docsclasstinyxml211xmlnode.html relnofollowhttpgrinninglizard.comtinyxml2docsclasstinyxml211xmlnode.htmla to find differences between using node, or element styles eg NextSiblingElement  but at best, I get one loop through with a failure, or just a crash. p  pThis parser doesnt work like the others, or I have the conventions wrong. Ive placed couts everywhere to see where I am, and the initial runs seem fine. Specifically NextSibling is causing issues, and I think I just dont know the tree structure that they intend to use.p  pThis is my nested loop as of now p  precode            for node  nodegtFirstChild node node  nodegtNextSibling                cout ltlt endl ltlt nodegtParentgtValue              for tempElement  nodegtFirstChildElement tempNode tempElement  tempElementgtNextSibling                   assign inner values                              take the inner values and assign them to an object              codepre  pSo, while my code matches all of the suggestions for traversing sibling elements, its failing. I could use some help from someone whos used this, as what I did in 30 minutes with every other system, is costing hours. p  pAlso, Im sure itll make more sense once their way is understood, but I cant find one working example on the internet of doing this. Plenty of ones suggesting the sample code I have not working.p  pFor the most part, TinyXML does find nodes and values, and if you remember that to get the type, you have to use nodeParentValue, then knowing where you are in a tree doesnt seem too hard.p  pJust for kicks, heres the load, which is workingp  precode    if doc.LoadFilexmlFilePath.cstr  XMLSUCCESS      XMLNode node  doc.RootElement     node  nodegtFirstChild root   .... codepre  pThanks for any assistance Would be greatly appreciated, and perhaps the only TinyXML2 question with a working answer for future askers, at least at this point in time.p  hr  pEDIT I cant answer yet, but I figured outp  pFor the love of... I hope Im doing something wrong, if youre doing this, pay attention to this pattern, it works Probably same for TinyXML2, Im guessing, just replace TiXmlNode with XMLNodep  pnote node refers to the root.p  pEssentially, think of the NextSibling as a function on the parent, where its laying out whos next.p  pThanks for the visits so far. This traverses at least to 6 items outer ones, yay, then Im sure the bug Im having now is my own.p  pThis should help somebody, if anyone else needs to traverse a tree dynamically.p  precode       TiXmlNode  subNode  nodegtFirstChild      forsubNode  node  subNode subNode  subNodegtParentgtNextSibling               subNode  subNodegtFirstChild     cout ltlt endl ltlt Parent  ltlt subNodegtParentgtValue ltlt endl          for tempNode  subNode tempNode tempNode  tempNodegtParentgtNextSibling                       tempNode  tempNodegtFirstChild codepre

Then another 10 of the same but the input names are page2p  pI wrote an onClcick for the container table so the user can select the whole table instead of the radio button, but not Im trying to change the style of the selected container so the users know they have selected it.p  pI have tried a few different methods and Im able to change the style to the new class by just writingp  precode document.getElementByIdcontainer.className  selected codepre  pBut because all 10 divs share the same name it will only change the style of the first element it finds.p  pSo I tried writing this loop to check if there are any selected radios in the document then to change the else name the style as the default.p  pIm sure its something stupid but Im pretty stumped atm..

Thus, Im using code.getScriptcode I am open to ANY other ideas, cause this is getting difficult to troubleshoot to load the script, on success it loads the next or echos error to the screen, and this repeats until the last script, which should then display the grid and allow the codedocument.readycode event to fire.  Problem is, neither of these things happen.  The code.holdReadycode appears to do nothing, and while the alertdone loading slicks fires properly, and web developer console reports no more errors, and scripts loading in the sequence I want, the grid isnt displaying, and the codedocument.readycode event fires as though the code.holdReadycode wasnt even there.  Any further insight into this implementation would help.  I know requireJS is built for exactly this dependencies, but I really cannot figure out how to utilize it properly in this context. p  pemstrongUPDATE  All Working Now Except code.holdReadycodeemstrongp  pAll working now except the code.holdReadycode.  Ive made that a moot point by instantiating the grid at the center of the nest, so it only runs when all scripts have completed successfully.  Works good, and lighter weight than requireJS..  Although.codegetScriptcode will not cache and will ALWAYS reload the file from the server.  Could relace those calls with code.ajaxcode calls and enable caching for a pretty big performance increase on files you dont change often.p  pIm posting the final nested script in case some people are having trouble getting slickGrid working for them the documentation SUCKS for such a great product.p  precodeltscriptgt.holdReadytrueltscriptgt   ltscript  typetextjavascript languagejavascript srcjsslickGridlibfirebugx.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjqueryui1.8.20.custom.min.js.phpgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjsslickGridpluginsslick.cellrangedecorator.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjsslickGridpluginsslick.cellrangeselector.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjsslickGridpluginsslick.cellselectionmodel.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjsslickGridslick.formatters.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjsslickGridslick.editors.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscriptgt      .getScriptjsslickGridjquery.event.drag2.0.min.js,function         .getScriptjsslickGridslick.core.js,function             .getScriptjsslickGridslick.grid.js,function                          .holdReadyfalse                         var grid                          var columns  [                          id VisitDate, name VisitDate, field VisitDate, width 120, cssClass celltitle, editor Slick.Editors.Text ,                          id VisitTime, name VisitTime, field VisitTime, width 100, editor Slick.Editors.Text ,                          id PrimaryComplaint, name PrimaryComplaint, field PrimaryComplaint, width 100, cssClass cellright, editor Slick.Editors.Text ,                         ]                          var data  [                                                          VisitDate 11302009,                             VisitTime 0117,                             PrimaryComplaint General malaise                              ,                                                          VisitDate 02082010,                             VisitTime 0930,                             PrimaryComplaint General malaise                                                       ]                          var options                           editable true,                         enableAddRow true,                         enableCellNavigation true,                         asyncEditorLoading false,                         forceFitColumns true                                                    grid  new Slick.Gridacswork, returnObj.source, columns, options                         var tabs  tabset.tabs                         var selected  tabs.tabsoption, selected  1  gt 0[edit]                         var panelstr  panel  selected                         to load dynamic data                          PROTO grid  new Slick.Gridpanelstr, returnObj.source, columns, options                          grid  new Slick.GridmyGrid, data, columns, options                                 loader.hide                            dateInput.cssopacity 0.0, visibility visible.animateopacity 1.0,slow                            myGrid.cssopacity 0.0, visibility visible.animateopacity 1.0,slow              .failfunctionjqxhr, settings, exception   document.writeFAILED exception          .failfunctionjqxhr, settings, exception   document.writeFAILED exception console.log textstatus      .failfunctionjqxhr, settings, exception   document.writeFAILED exception console.log textstatus  codepre

Negative 34297 pI might sound lazy but I am slightly confused on how to proceed on this subject. I have followed a hrefhttpwww.learncocos2d.com201204enablingarccocos2dprojecthowtostepbysteptutorialguide relnofollowthis guidea which is very well done.p  pMy goal is to convert the Cocos2d v1.x game project to Cocos2d v2.x and then refactor the project code to ARC.p  pTo get started I created an empty HelloWorld Cocos2d v2.x project and created the v2.x static library as from Steffens guide. I then rafactored the code to ARC and the HelloWorld worked smoothly.p  pThe issue is when I try to add to the same project the classes I had already written that dont complain to ARC assuming that there will be not many Cocos2d v2.x vs v1.x problems  e.g. use of deprecated methods and classes like TouchJSON  my project doesnt at least as far I can see. So, I added a couple of Game classes that dont depend from the rest of the game to reduce the number of potential Cocos2d v2. Vs v1 issues to the project to see if the ARC covnersion worked for those as a proof of concept. After adding them I choosed EDITRefactor option from XCode.p  pBut now the compiler gives me some ARC warning messages like ARC forbids explicit message send of autorelease in the following methodp  precodereturn [[[self alloc] init] autorelease] codepre  pOr similar problems with the dealloc method already written.p  pI was assuming that EDITRefactor would have changed the added code but it appears to work only once. Any hint on this strongshould I add all my code to the new project template before refactoring the codestrong p  pEDITTo verify whether it was an XCode bug I created an empty iOS project with no Cocos2d libraries and then converted it to ARC. Then created a new empty sublcass of NSObject and added a dealloc method and run the conversion again, it did work So I might have not followed correctly some of the steps to create and link to the static library.. p  pIn addition to this there are some other small issues not XCode related, but Cocos2d v2.x related, like the fact that the strongCDXPropertyModifierActionstrong is not automatically included to the CocosDenshion folder and I had to add it to the project after creating the static library when I noticed the issue.. but I guess this is more template creation related.p  pThanks for readingp

I tried to rule out all other things by making a test page with just a simple formp  precodeltform methodpost actionhttpssecure.mysite.comformtest2.php targettopgt   ltinput typetext nameelement valueblabla gt   ltinput typesubmit valuesubmit gt ltformgt codepre  pand a receiving pagep  precodeltphp  print POST  printrPOST  print ltbrgtGET  printrGET gt codepre  pWhen I click the submit button in Chrome everything works as expected and I getp  pPOSTArray  [myelement]  blabla p  pGETArray  p  pHowever when I use ctrlclick I see this in a new tabp  pPOSTArray  p  pGETArray  p  pSo my question is, is this normal behavior or a bug in Chrome my version is 21.0.1180.83 m And is there anyway to prevent this from happening so I do not have to show the user some sort of error page redirecting him back and asking not to open the submit of the form in a new tab UGLYp

Negative 34297 pI am learning scheme and one of the things I have to do is recursion to figure out if the list is reflective, i.e. the list looks the same when it is reversed. I have to do it primitively so I cant use the reverse method for lists. I must also use recursion which is obvious. The problem is in scheme its very hard to access the list or shorten the list using the very basic stuff that we have learned, since these are kinda of like linkedlists. I also want to do without using indexing. With that said I have a few ideas and was wondering If any of these sufficient and do you think I could actually do it better with the basics of scheme.p  ol liReverse the list using recursion my implementation and compare the original and this rev. list.li liCompare the first and last element by recursing on the rest of the list to find the last element and compare to first. Keeping track of how many times I have recursed and then do it one less for the second last element of the list, to compare to the second element of the list.

And I get all OCD and organize files and folders so many times during the day and its driving me nuts.p  pSo I plan on writing an app that detects when a file has finished downloading to the Windows Downloads folder, and then places it in its relevant categorized folder.p  pE.g. I download an app. When the app detects that the file has finished downloading, it places it into Subfolder emApplciationsem. Or, when I finish downloading a Document, the document is then placed inside the emDocumentsem subfolder of the Downloads folder.p  pThe problem I have here is that I dont want to do this unless there is a definitive way to tell whether a file has finished downloading.p  pThings I have thought ofp  ol liI have thought about implementing FileSystemWatcher on the Downloads folder, and when a new file is created there, it gets added to a list. And when FileSystemWatcher detects that the file size has changed, or has been modified, it will start a timer the purpose of this timer is to determine emafter strongxstrong amount of secondsem whether the download is complete. It does this by assuming wrongly that if a files size has not increased in a specified period of time, the download is complete.li ol  pThats all I can think of.

Negative 34297 pIm just copy amp pasting some of the introductory text from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq133508581391249one of my questionsa, since the same table relationship is involved in this question also.p  hr  pI have three of many tables in Oracle 10g database as listed below. Im using Hibernate Tools 3.2.1.GA with Spring version 3.0.2.p  ol listrongProductstrong  parent tableli listrongColourstrong  parent tableli listrongProductColourstrong  join table  references codecolourIdcode and codeprodIdcode of codeColourcode and codeProductcode tables respectivelyli ol  pWhere the  table codeProductColourcode is a emjoin tableem between codeProductcode and codeColourcode. As the table names imply, there is a manytomany relationship between codeProductcode and codeColourcode which is mapped by codePrductColourcode. I think, the relationship in the database can easily be imagined and is clear with only this much information. Therefore, Im not going to explore this relationship at length unnecessarily.p  pAn entity row in codeProductcode is associated with any number entities in codeColourcode and an entity row in codeColourcode can also be associated with any number of entities in codeProductcode.p  hr  pSince, it is a manytomany relationship, it is mapped in the codeProductcode and the codeColourcode entity classes POJOs with their respective codejava.util.Setcode and no direct POJO class for the codeproductcolourcode table is available.p  pThe class codeProductcode looks like the following.p  precodepublic class Product  implements java.io.Serializable       private BigDecimal prodId     private SetltColourgt colours  new HashSetltColourgt0      .     .     .      Other properties with setters and getters.   codepre  pThe class codeColourcode looks like the following.p  precodepublic class Colour implements java.io.Serializable       private BigDecimal colourId     private SetltProductgt products  new HashSetltProductgt0      .     .     .      Other properties with setters and getters.   codepre  pThe actual mapping between entities is available in codexxx.hbm.xmlcode files, regarding this question which is unnecessary, I think .p  hr  pWhat I want to do is to retrieve only those rows from the codeColourcode table which dont match the colour rows in the codeProductColourcode table strongfor a particular product at a timestrong. In this regard, the native Oracle SQL statement would look something like the following.p  precodeSELECT colourid, colourname, colourhex FROM colour WHERE colourid not in SELECT colourid FROM productcolour WHERE prodid81 ORDER BY colourid DESC codepre  pWhere codeprodidcode can be any valid codeBigDecimalcode number in Java which is dynamic.p  pAs noted earlier, the relationship is available as a manytomany relationship in Hibernate, no POJO class for the database table codeproductcolourcode is available and therefore, Im fumbling in writing such an HQL statement in Hibernate. I have tried to write such an HQL statement but no attempts were succeeded.p  hr  p[The code presented in the rest of the part may completely be unnecessary to review]p  pIm therefore following a traditional way. What Im doing is... Im first retrieving a single product row from the codeProductcode the entity class based on a dynamic value of codeprodIdcode such as,p  precodeListltProductgtlistsession.createQueryfrom Product where prodIdprodId                   .setParameterprodId, prodId.list codepre  pand then using a loop, Im getting the entire codeColourcode set  codejava.util.Setcode corresponding to the codeproductcolourcode table in Oracle which is available in the codeProductcode entity for this product such as,p  precodeSetltColourgtcoloursnew HashSetltColourgt0  forProduct plist      ifpnull                             coloursp.getColours       codepre  pAs can be seen, the codecolourscode codeSetcode is being populated with all of the colour rows available reference rows in the codeproductcolourcode table in Oracle.p  pAfter getting all of these rows, Im getting the entire codeColourcode entity class itself all the row in it that corresponds to the codecolourcode table in Oracle and then removing those rows which match the rows retrieved from the codeproductcolourcode Oracle table available in the codecolourscode Set in the preceding snippet satisfying the condition as mentioned earlier such as,p  precodeListltColourgtcolourListsession.createQueryfrom Colour order by colourId desc.list IteratorltColourgtitcolourList.iterator          whileit.hasNext      Colour cColourit.next     forColour pccolours     colours is available in the preceding snippet.              ifcpc                      it.remove                codepre  hr  pThis can do what is intended but doing so, may imply some overhead on the system. Additionally, what I want to achieve doesnt seem possible with this approach which is strongpaginationstrong. I cant use the codesetFirstResultintcode and the codesetMaxResultsintcode methods to accomplish the task of pagination which is the case otherwise like the one shown below regarding the codeProductcode entity class, p  precodeListltProductgt productssession.createQueryfrom product order by prodId desc                        .setMaxResults0.setFirstResult4  codepre  hr  pstrongSo the question is againstrong, regarding this relationship, is this possible to write such an HQL statement that can retrieve only those rows from the codeColourcode entity class which dont match the colour rows in the codeproductcolourcode Oracle table stronglike the native SQL statement shown abovestrong p  pHow can I achieve the concept of pagination otherwise in case, it is not possiblep

Negative 34297 pIm wanting to start using Sequelize, a module that allows ORM for mysql in node.js. I was wondering if its possible to autogenerate the models like CakePHP does. In CakePHP, it will read the tables info, and automatically create the associations and fields with their types in the model. id really hate to have to completely map out all my tables by hand, as some are relatively large. Is there something out there that will do this for me Or am I on my own to handtype all the models outp
Negative 34297 pIve found many questions here about android camera preview orientation problems. All the fixes involve fixing the screen orientation to landscape or calling camera.setDisplayOrientation90 or calling params.setRotation90. I cant find the combination of settings which actually make it work when held in landscape orientation.p  pThe activity is fixed to landscape mode with androidscreenOrientationlandscape.p  pMy problem is that if I hold the camera in portrait orientation and start up the application it works fine by which I mean that it properly shows the image as a landscape. If I hold the camera in landscape orientation when starting the application the picture is all messed up sort of interlaced. If I use camera.setDisplayOrientation90 the picture is no longer messed up, but the image is oriented sideways.p  pStrangely, if I remove the androidscreenOrientationlandscape and allow the screen to rotate, I still have the same problems, but if I rotate the phone to portrait it looks fine in portrait. If I rotate it back to landscape then it looks fine in landscape My only problem is that it wont work correctly when it first starts up.p  precodeimport java.util.List  import android.content.Context import android.graphics.Color import android.hardware.Camera import android.hardware.Camera.Parameters import android.hardware.Camera.Size import android.util.AttributeSet import android.util.Log import android.view.   public class CameraView extends SurfaceView          Callback for the surfaceholder     SurfaceHolder.Callback surfaceHolderListener  new SurfaceHolder.Callback          public void surfaceCreatedSurfaceHolder holder              try                  cameraCamera.open              catchException e                  Log.eCameraView,Couldnt open the camera.,e                          try                  camera.setPreviewDisplaypreviewHolder              catch Throwable e                  Log.eCameraView,Couldnt call setPreviewDisplay.,e                                public void surfaceChangedSurfaceHolder surfaceHolder, int format, int w, int h              ifcameranull                  Parameters params  camera.getParameters                  ListltSizegt sizes  params.getSupportedPreviewSizes                 Size optimalSize  getOptimalPreviewSizesizes, w, h                 params.setPreviewSizeoptimalSize.width, optimalSize.height                  camera.setParametersparams                 camera.startPreview                                public void surfaceDestroyedSurfaceHolder arg0              ifcameranull                  camera.setPreviewCallbacknull                 camera.stopPreview                 camera.release                                private Size getOptimalPreviewSizeListltSizegt sizes, int w, int h              final double ASPECTTOLERANCE  0.05             double targetRatio  double w  h             if sizes  null return null              Size optimalSize  null             double minDiff  Double.MAXVALUE              int targetHeight  h               Try to find an size match aspect ratio and size             for Size size  sizes                  double ratio  double size.width  size.height                 if Math.absratio  targetRatio gt ASPECTTOLERANCE continue                 if Math.abssize.height  targetHeight lt minDiff                      optimalSize  size                     minDiff  Math.abssize.height  targetHeight                                             Cannot find the one match the aspect ratio, ignore the requirement             if optimalSize  null                  minDiff  Double.MAXVALUE                 for Size size  sizes                      if Math.abssize.height  targetHeight lt minDiff                          optimalSize  size                         minDiff  Math.abssize.height  targetHeight                                                                return optimalSize                     public CameraViewContext ctx          superctx          previewHolder  this.getHolder         previewHolder.setTypeSurfaceHolder.SURFACETYPEPUSHBUFFERS         previewHolder.addCallbacksurfaceHolderListener         setBackgroundColorColor.TRANSPARENT           public CameraViewContext ctx, AttributeSet attrs          superctx, attrs           private Camera camera     private SurfaceHolder previewHolder  codepre  pEDIT The real problem seems to be that something happens after surfaceChanged which screws things up.

Negative 34297 pI am using CoreLocation to determine users location to calculate the distance and show the route on the map. To minimize battery usage I am turning off GPS after getting location and turning it on again after 1 minute. When the application is active everything works fine, but after sending it to background and turning off GPS, the app seems to be inactive at all, it doesnt output anything using codeNSLogcode. I have added directive to codeinfo.plistcode file to allow the application to run in background. When I dont turn off the GPS in background the app works as well as in foreground.p  pSo my question is the following does GPS always need to be turned on in background to prevent the application to be suspended or there is another workaround because the turned GPS drains the batteryp  pP.S. I am new to iOS and mobile development at all, so maybe there are some tips that I have to know.p

Negative 34297 pI have a small question i came up with reading this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7026507whyarestaticvariablesconsideredevilWhy are static variables considered evilap  pIn my application i have a really massive amount of lets say configuration variables. E.g. fonts, colors, cached images, ... As most of them never change i considered them being static.  Nevertheless my application is an applet and as the client has been executing the applet once, some of these static information may change, as a given configuration may have been changed. Therefore lets say this kind of data is used to change rarely, but is not considered being final.p  pIn addition as the amount of information i handle that way is huge, i mapped them onto own Enums like thatp  precodepublic enum Fonts       COLORCHOOSER, MAPMETADATA      private Font localFont      public Font getValue          return localFont           private void setValueFont newFont          localFont  newFont        protected static void initFonts      Fonts.COLORCHOOSER.setValuenew FontArial, Font.PLAIN, 15     Fonts.MAPMETADATA.setValuefontrace.deriveFontFont.BOLD, 11  codepre  pBy using enums like that, I was able to identify the value I am looking for pretty easily, while i can maintain all of them at just one place. p  pSomeone may say, since this is static, I could alternatively place them within the objects, they are used in anyway. Nevertheless, I considered the current behavior being more easy to read.p  pBesides of that the initFonts method becomes replaced in future by a mapping method, which gets the currently hard coded values from an external source like json or xml. Therefore if i work OO this would mean to forward any of the incoming data to the corresponding objects, which I consider of being NOT easy to read.p  pTo come up with my question How would somebody of you mapcache halfway final parameters I also considered having a hashmap with an enum as key value. E.g for Images, Fonts, Colors, pixel margins, etc. Is the way i am using these enums appropriate or may I consider them being evil, since they are static If yes  what would be an appropriate way, which keeps being easy to read and easy to maintain p  pI considered my solution of being a possible way to go, but were going to rethink the whole design after reading the above mentioned thread.p  pThanks a lot for any advice. Kind regards.p
Negative 34297 pIm not very good with MySQL statements, so Im looking for some insight. Lets say a user visits someone elses page. This will send the username as a parameter to a script to check if the current user and the users page they are visiting are friends.p  pMy simple database structurep  pstrongFRIENDS TABLEstrong  coderelationshipid, friend1ID, friend2ID, statuscodep  pstrongACTIVEUSERS TABLEstrong  codeid, username, emailcode...etc.p  pMy current SQL statement is as followsp  precodeSELECT   FROM friends JOIN activeusers ON  activeusers.username   username   WHERE      friends.friend1ID  currentuserID     AND friends.friend2ID  activeusers.id     AND friends.status  1  codepre  pWhile this WORKS, I dont feel its elegant. It returns a row if the two are friends, but this row obviously is a join of the user information row and the relationship row. I would just like to grab the relationship row. Would it be economical to break this up into two statements For instance, I would query for the visited pages user ID using the username, and then use that variable in a second statement to grab the relationship. Or is there an easier syntax I have not come across Help is appreciatedp

How do I find out what the error message is  I read that checkcall can return an error message and something about a returncode attribute.

Negative 34297 pI have a JS script that relies on an AJAX call which adds a parameter to an html request. Im running into two issues.p  ol liI cant figure out a simple way to get the pathname including parameters. In straight JS, codelocation.pathnamecode only returns the current path without the parameters. With JQuery, codedocument.hrefcode returns the whole URL, but including stuff I dont want such as scheme, domain, etc. Is there a nice, simple, easy method that returns just the path including parametersli liOnce I have the path, I havent yet figured out a good way of adding a parameter, given that the path may already include zero or more parameters. Luckily I dont need to update a key that already exists, just add a new one. Ive found some similar questions on SO already, for instance a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions486896addingaparametertotheurlwithjavascriptAdding a parameter to the URL with JavaScripta, but is there a way to do this without writing my own URL parser or other boilerplate codeli ol
Negative 34297 pIm trying to get a better idea of how many threads should run on n number of cores. I know this a complicated question in which the answer depends on a number of factors, such as how much shared state there is, and how much sleeping and waiting on resources each thread does. p  pTo simplify things, lets say we have 2 cores and just one process that can divide its work into threads with no shared state. Lets say each thread just performs computation after computation with no sleeping and no waiting on resources. Would the ideal number of threads in this case be 2p  pLets complicate things a bit and say that the threads have to do some sort of disk IO. How does this change our answer I would think that we could have more than 2 cores in this case.p  pOr lets say they dont do any sleeping or waiting on resources, but instead theres some memory that they both have access to that requires synchronization. How does this change our answer I would think that in this case we may actually prefer 1 thread over 2, depending on how much synchronization is required.p
Negative 34297 pIn my project, the protocol unchangeable specifies the following structuresp  precodetypedef struct  long type char username[USERNAMEMAXLENGTH] int ipcnum MSGLOGIN   typedef struct long type int msgtype char sendtime[6] char sender[USERNAMEMAXLENGTH] char receiver[USERNAMEMAXLENGTH] char message[MAXMSGLENGTH] MSGCHATMESSAGE  typedef struct long type int requesttype char username[USERNAMEMAXLENGTH] MSGREQUEST codepre  pThe client can send any of those structures to the server, and the server has to react accordingly. Im writing a server, and have no idea how to use codemsgrcvcode to receive them. When I have only one such structure, its easy  I just pass a pointer to an empty structure of such type to it. But what if I dont know in advance which one Ill receive Should I just define codestruct generic long type char buffer[BIGNUMBER]code If so, will I be able to extract the data to individual variablesp
Negative 34297 pHey guys I have this piece of javascript made for adding up coins. Its works perfectly until you try to add a certain list of coins, at which point it bugs out and gives you a recurring decimal... the list is 0.20, y, 0.50, y, 0.10, n.

Negative 34297 pIm trying to determine the dependency on jQuery on the client side. Basically, I would like a Controller to subscribe to the Hub and update the Controller Action Redirect, ViewBag, etc when a Hub methodevent is fired. So far, I only find examples of jQuery hub connections that perform some updates to the view, like appending ltli to a ltul for message output. p  pI keep hearing that you can do a pure .NET client implementation of SignalR from presentations found on Channel9, but cant seem to find how it is implemented. Code referencesarticles would be nice.p

I have tried trycatch and window.onerror in my code but in vain.p  pI am trying to render an SVG chart a hrefhttpg.raphaeljs.comreference.htmlPaper.dotchart relnofollowgRaphael dotcharta inside a hidden div.

When I click on this error, the console window takes me to the top of the html file where the error occurred, instead of the exact line in the client code or gRaphael library code. The error actually originates where the function codedotchartcode gets called on the codeRaphaelcode object r.dotchart....

Negative 34297 pSuppose in C you have a codeDictionaryltK, Vgtcode object that multiple threads are accessing and changing.  You want certain operations to be threadsafe.p  pSo you reach for a mutex.  In C, the standard way to use a mutex isp  precodelock someSharedObject      Mutual exclusion zone here.    myDictionary.Add1, hello  codepre  pThe problem is, youre relying merely on documentation to keep future programmers from accessing the dictionary directly, bypassing the mutexp  precodemyDictionary.Add1, hello codepre  pI want the compiler to prevent a future programmer from using the unprotected dictionary.p  pI see two general possibilitiesp  ol liCreate a Dictionary lookalike say, codeLockedDictionarycode which ensures locking in its member methods but acts like a Dictionary in every other way.li liCreate a class that guards access to the codeDictionarycode, so the caller cannot reach the codeDictionarycode without going through the guard.li ol  pThese fulfill the desireable property that now no one can use the dictionary unprotected, at least accidentally.  I want to discuss the pros and cons of both, and then ask you to agree or disagree with me as well as to suggest a solution I may have overlooked.p  pThe upside of codeLockedDictionarycode is that its intuitive for others.  It also allows finegrained control of which methods need locking and to what extent.  The downside is that its not exactly a codeDictionarycode, so you cannot pass this object to a function that expects to receive a codeDictionarycode.  Though you can get close by implementing codeIDictionarycode.p  pMoving on to 2. The upside of a guard class is that you can implement codeIDisposablecode and use it like thisp  precodeclass DictionaryFortress     DictionaryltK, Vgt realDict    Object lockobject    void Lock        Monitor.Enterlockobject       return DictionaryGuardlockobject, realDict       class DictionaryGuard  IDisposable     public DictionaryltK, Vgt Dict        get  return realDict         public void Dispose        Monitor.Exitlockobject        in some class DictionaryFortress dict  new DictionaryFortress  early on   in a function, when we need to access dictionary contents... using DictionaryGuard guard  dict.Lock     DictionaryltK, Vgt actualDict  guard.Dict     now you can pass actualDict anywhere no one has to know that its locked  codepre  pThe upside, of course, is that we have access to the raw dictionary, so were not constrained in how we can use it and where we can pass it.  The downside is that theres more overhead in using it.  Its also possible for a user to save a reference to codeguard.Dictcode while its available, then use it after DictionaryGuard is disposed.p  pI am leaning toward 2.  Did I miss any pros and cons  Is there a better way of protecting access to my dictionary while minimizing the risk of misuse Again, my emrequirementem is that a forgetful or careless programmer cannot skip the locking stage.  My desirements are that its idiomatic, convenient, and flexible.p

Negative 34297 pI do want to build a generic gateway from a nested map generated from binary data stream to SOAP clients.p  pBackground a nonjavaapplication which needs to call SOAPServices cant generate json or SOAPXML, but easily generate a custom protocol which is under our control.p  pSo a proxy is needed.

However, when I have Fiddler2 running, the code works fine. So I am using Wireshark instead. In addition, the service works perfect within my browser Chrome, and if I use Wireshark to compare the HTTP requestsresponses for the Authentication, I see that they are nearly identical, except that in Chrome I have Accept, UserAgent, AcceptEncoding, and AcceptLanguage headers, while my C app does not have these. The only other difference is that my C app sets the Negotiate Seal flag in the NTLM header, while Chrome does not set this flag.p  pDespite these differences, the authentication phase seems to work fine in the C app, up until the service returns a 302  Redirection, at which point the app tries a GET on the newly redirected URI, which returns a 401 again when Chrome does the analogous GET, it receives HTTP 200  OK, and proceeds on its merry way.p  pSo, any ideas what could cause this Problem with the service or my codep  pThanks a lot Erikp

Negative 34297 pI need to write some stuff to a file based on elements of a Clojure collection, which I can dobut I ran into something that confuses me. Its probably because I dont fully understand the time macro, but when I do the followingp  precodegt def nums take 100000 repeatedly str randint 1000      defn out1 [nums] doseq [n nums] spit blah1.txt n append true    defn out2 [nums] map spit blah2.txt  append true nums test.corenums test.coreout1 test.coreout2 gt time out1 nums Elapsed time 19133.247 msecs nil gt time out2 nums Elapsed time 0.209 msecs nil nil nil nil ...  codepre  pthe implementation using map out2 runs significantly faster. However, when I go to the folder and watch the file, it continues to do the writing after the Elapsed time is given and the nil ... output waits until its done writing to show also. That leads me to believe that theyre both actually taking the same time.p  pSo, whats the difference between using doseq and map in this situation And which way would be better overall Thanksp

Negative 34297 pI have a table of data that simply consists of foreignkey fields and a BLOB column, as other tables need not retrieve large blobs on a regular basis.p  pSo with the datablob on its own, does it matter what length it is For example, if I want to store cached webpages...for most pages, the 65KB limitation of BLOB will do it...but inevitably, there will be pages with 100KB of data, but the next size of blob, MEDIUMBLOB, is 16MBp  pa hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.0enblob.html relnofollowhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.0enblob.htmlap  pHow does changing my datablob field from BLOB to MEDIUMBLOB affect any kind of retrieval operations, whether its just several records at a row or large batch operations I dont mean, how does retrieving records of 16MB in size different than records of 64KB...I mean to ask, is there a difference if that blob is sparsely populated That is, 90 of those fields have only 60K of data, and the rest may be past the 65K limit.p  pAnother way to ask this If the data Im working with may consist of 50 blobs of BLOB size, and 50 of MEDIUMBLOB...should I create two tables and separate the data that way Or is it of little difference than just making one MEDIUMBLOB table and storing all the small blobs in there which would simplify the database access codep

The load balancer performs the ping operation every 5 seconds. p  pSince the server is requesting BizTalk every 5 seconds its likely that load will be high on services. which i want to avoid. p  pI have a thought of creating an echo service and host it in BizTalk so that the load on actual services will be avoided.p  pBut I am unaware that they are any other ways we can perform the health check.

Negative 34297 pWe are investigate how to using modern code version systems for a legacy systems. However, there are some difficulties that we do not really know how to solve. How do you think we should going to organize thisp  ol lipSome parts of the code we have responsibility for, and some parts the customer are responsibility for.p  pThe code that is in our development system is the master, and all changes are made there and then sent out to the customer. So far is it like a common project. But for some directories with a few hundred files, the client is responsible for the code. Customer can change these files as they want, and do not have inform us. When we do an update for them, we need to get a copy of these files and merge our changes before we give the new version to the customer.pli lipWe have released 4 base versions of the system over the 25 years the system have lived. Our six customers, however, use different versions of the system, which means that we have to consider it. In addition, each customer has their own requirements, and we have made major adjustments for each customer.pli lipWe have several parallel projects related to the same files. Today we have major problems that the various projects interfere with each other, so we will benefit greatly from having changes in different branches. But how do we organize this Some projects affect only one customer, other projects involving several customers. And some projects may be introduced into a new future base version.pli ol  pSo my question is how to organize this in our new version system.p

This is the order they get called when I start the app   p  pcodeonCreate then gt onResumecode I then exit my app codeonPausecodep  pBut when I return, onResume does not appear in logcat and neither does onCreate if you were wondering.

Negative 34297 pI have a situation where I am processing some data in a thread that is fired from an event initially, but it needs to wait until something happens in the main thread before continuing  the issue being there could be any number of these running concurrently.

Negative 34297 pI have been tasked with writing an application that connects to multiple h.264 streams and stores them in a large storage array. The streams are from security cameras and thus, never ending. Obviously, I cant simply continuously dump video data into a separate file for each camera. So what are my options for storing the streams My initial thought is to store 60 second segments that I can, according to some heuristic, periodically clean up and remove but this seems like the naive approach. Does anyone have any experience in this field and have any tips or pointers on best practices for such an application.p  pThis is more of a conceptual question as my requirements are just on the storage and retrieval of the footage. I am platform and language agnostic.p

So, i created a Map varialbe by the name dimensions as like as in the documentation a hrefhttpswww.parse.comdocsandroidguideanalyticscustom relnofollowhttpswww.parse.comdocsandroidguideanalyticscustoma and under a metadata pack name of Valuesp  precodeParseAnalytics.trackEventValues,dimensions codepre  pI keep track of the stepsp  precodedimensions.putstep,Integer.toStringstep codepre  pParse Analytics gives me the option to breakdown the Value track event, to show me the item step how many requests have made.

Im using PHP based script for MySQL connection and for strongPaginationstrong. From what Ive researched, queries with no input data from user cant be harmed by hacker unless the PHP file is directly accessed andor replaced. Therefore I decided to put it above my web root. Ive added pagination feature for jTable, which uses SQL query with some input data from JS script. For heavens sake I decided to protect this query from any malicious SQL Injections.p  pThe queryp  precodeSELECT  FROM people LIMIT  . GET[jtStartIndex] . , . GET[jtPageSize] .  codepre  pWhat I did is Ive added casts to int, for exp  precodeSELECT  FROM people LIMIT  . intGET[jtStartIndex] . , . intGET[jtPageSize] .  codepre  pIs it safe enough As far as I remember, any string that will go there will be parsed to 0 by int cast.p

Negative 34297 pI have an EC2 server running Elasticsearch 0.9 with a nginx server for readwrite access.  My index has about 750k smallmedium documents.  I have a pretty continuous stream of minimal writes mainly updates to the content.  The speedsconsistency I receive with search is fine with me, but I have some sporadic timeout issues with a hrefhttpwww.elasticsearch.orgguideenelasticsearchreferencecurrentdocsmultiget.html relnofollowmultiget codemgetcodea.p  pOn some pages in my app, our server will request a multiget of a dozen to a few thousand documents this usually takes less than 12 seconds.  The requests that fail, fail with a 30,000 millisecond timeout from the nginx server.  I am assuming this happens because the index was temporarily locked for writingoptimizing purposes.  Does anyone have any ideas on what I can do herep  pA temporary solution would be to lower the timeout and return a user friendly message saying documents couldnt be retrieved however they still would have to wait 10 seconds to see an error message.p  pSome of my other thoughts were to give read priority over writes.  Anytime someone is trying to read a part of the index, dont allow any writeslocks to that section.  I dont think this would be scalable and it may not even be possiblep  pFinally, I was thinking I could have a readonly alias and a writeonly alias.  I can figure out how to set this up through the documentation, but I am not sure if it will actually work like I expect it to and Im not sure how I can reliably test it in a local environment.  If I set up aliases like this, would the readonly alias still have moments where the index was locked due to information being written through the writeonly aliasp  pIm sure someone else has come across this before, what is the typical solution to make sure a user can always read data from the index with a higher priority over writes.  I would consider increasing our server power, if required.  Currently we have 2 m2xlarge EC2 instances.

This home page features a navigation system different to the rest of sections for which I used a standard horizontal nav bar. p  pMy problem is that I need the nav bar to stay fixed on its position so when I scroll down, its still there but I dont want this nav bar to show on the home screen.

Negative 34297 pIm now building up an iPad app which uses codeUISplitViewControllercode and on the detail view controller I want to initialize two codeUITableViewcode.

I dont think Ive made any mistakes so far.p  pHowever, heres the image of the resultant detail view controller. The first table view starts populating its cells after some space is filled at the top of the table view. It looks like the redundant spaces height is same to the height of the navigation bar, but when I tried to output codeself.viewcode before the codeaddSubviewcode method on the above code, I got the same result saying codeself.view  ltUIView 0x10a3dd920 frame  0 0 768 1024 autoresize  WH layer  ltCALayer 0x10a3dd800gtgtcode.

Negative 34297 pIm trying to make an optimal SQL query for an iSeries database table that can contain millions of rows perhaps up to 3 million per month. The only key I have for each row is its RRN relative record number, which is the physical record number for the row.p  pMy goal is to join the table with another small table to give me a textual description of one of the numeric columns. However, the number of rows involved can exceed 2 million, which typically causes the query to fail due to an outofmemory condition. So I want to rewrite the query to avoid joining a large subset with any other table. So the idea is to select a single page up to 30 rows within a given month, and emthenem join that subset to the second table. p  pHowever, I ran into a weird problem. I use the following query to retrieve the RRNs of the rows I want for the pagep  precode    select t.RRN2     Gives correct RRNs     from        select rownumber over as SEQ,         rrne2 as RRN2, e2.       from TABLE1 as e2       where e2.UPDATED between 20130501 and 20130531       order by e2.UPDATED, e2.ACCOUNT      as t     where t.SEQ gt 270 and t.SEQ lt 300     Paging     order by t.UPDATED, t.ACCOUNT codepre  pThis query works just fine, returning the correct RRNs for the rows I need. However, when I attempted to join the result of the subquery with another table, emthe RRNs changedem. So I simplified the query to a subquery within a simple outer query, without any joinp  precodeselect rrne as RRN, e.   from TABLE1 as e   where rrne in      select t.RRN2     Gives correct RRNs     from        select rownumber over as SEQ,         rrne2 as RRN2, e2.       from TABLE1 as e2       where e2.UPDATED between 20130501 and 20130531       order by e2.UPDATED, e2.ACCOUNT      as t     where t.SEQ gt 270 and t.SEQ lt 300     Paging     order by t.UPDATED, t.ACCOUNT      order by e.UPDATED, e.ACCOUNT codepre  pThe outer query simply grabs all of the columns of each row selected by the subquery, using the RRN as the row key. But this query emdoes not workem  it returns rows with completely different RRNs.p  pI need the actual RRN, because it will be used to retrieve more detailed information from the table in a subsequent query.p  pAny ideas about why the RRNs end up differentp  pstrongResolutionstrongp  pI decided to break the query into two calls, one to issue the simple subquery and return just the RRNs rowsIDs, and the second to do the rest of the JOINs and so forth to retrieve the complete info for each row. Since the table gets updated only once a day, and rows never get deleted, there are no potential timing problems to worry about.p  pThis approach appears to work quite well.p  pstrongAddendumstrongp  pAs to the question of why an outofmemory error occurs, this appears to be a limitation on only emsomeem of our test servers. Some can only handle up to around 2m rows, while others can handle much more than that. So Im guessing that this is some sort of limit imposed by the admins on a serverbyserver basis.p
Negative 34297 pI am using MVVM and displaying some items on a DataGrid.  My model is RecordingInfo and looks likep  precodepublic class RecordingInfo  IDataErrorInfo       public RecordingInfostring fullDirectoryName, string recordingName, int recordingNumber              FullDirectoryName  fullDirectoryName         RecordingName  recordingName         RecordingNumber  recordingNumber           public string FullDirectoryName  get internal set      public string RecordingName  get  set      public int RecordingNumber  get internal set        public string Error              get  throw new NotImplementedException            public string this[string propertyName]              get              if propertyName  RecordingName                              if this.RecordingName.Length lt 2                     return Recording Name must be at least two characters                          return null                 codepre  pI end up with a collection of these RecordingInfo programmatically.  The user is not allowed to do much with these but heshe can change the RecordingName subject to the name being 2 characters or more AND that the RecordingName must be unique. I.e. no changing it to match another RecordingName. I have taken care of the first requirement.  Its the second one that is giving me grief.  p  pFor my ViewModel, I have p  precodepublic class RecordingListViewModel  ViewModelBase, IDataErrorInfo      private ObservableCollectionltRecordingInfogt recordings  null        public RecordingListViewModel                public ObservableCollectionltRecordingInfogt Recordings              get                      return recordings                    more stuff left off for brevity codepre  pIn my view I bind the collection to a DataGrid and havep  precodeltDataGrid  ItemsSourceBinding PathRecordings  AutoGenerateColumnsFalse gt             ltDataGrid.Columnsgt                 ltDataGridTextColumn HeaderRecording  IsReadOnlyFalse   EditingElementStyleStaticResource CellEditStyle ElementStyleStaticResource CellNonEditStyle BindingBinding RecordingName, UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged, ValidatesOnDataErrorsTrue gt                  ltDataGridTextColumngt                 ...             ltDataGrid.Columnsgt codepre  pMy way of checking for 2 or more characters works great.  But this doesnt work for checking that the user is not trying to give a recording an existing name.  Presumably, I need to somehow handle this at the ViewModel layer since the ViewModel knows about all Recordings.   I tried playing with having my ViewModel derive from IDataErrorInfo but the property indexer never gets called, which makes sense as its the Observable collection and therefore the individual RecordingInfos that are bound.  I also thought about doing something with a Lost Focus event, but DataGridTextColumn doesnt seem to have that.  I would think this is a somewhat common problem validation must take into account relationships between the items of the collection.p  pBy the way, Im not wedded to the IDataErrorInfo and I am not opposed to other changes in architecture.  Please let me know if I can provide more details.  I have tried to provide a minimal amount of code.  Clearly, this is part of a much bigger project.  Any advice is appreciated.p  pThanks,p  pDavep

Negative 34297 pIm developing a proxy service which has to count requests and injects the number of requests in the payload and sends it to next endpoint. To develop this counter I can use just a class mediator which is so easy and useful since it loads in memory and this makes it fast, but the fact of writing java code that needs compilation made me think of more agile method. I came up with saving in a file in the registry, which is not good since there is no loading in memory and it has IO overhead. I was wondering if it can be implemented in script mediator with for example jscript.p  pIm trying to find best way to do that.p

I uninstalled zlibdevel When I do have zlibdevel package installed which then gives me a system install of zlib, which I dont want, the error about zlib.h changes and is instead about not being able to find zconf.h.  p  pThe pathology is the same.  The example.c file is not finding the correct header files.  You can get a pretty good sense of howwhy this happened from the CMakeLists.txt file that comes with zlib.  The part where it builds the zlib library itself mentions ZLIBPUBLICHDRS, but the part where it builds the example doesnt mention that variable.  Hence it ist looking for the headers locally.  Im guessing herep

Negative 34297 pSo Im currently developing a turn based game app. And it displays toasts from a view on whos turn it is after each turn is taken. Whats weird though, is if I hit the back button it will go back to the main menuprevious activity but the toasts will still linger till they time out. Also if I hit back twice and it goes to the home screen, the toasts will still show until they finish. I want to implement a check or some way to cancel those toasts when the back button is pressed. I have to do this in my view too, my view contains all the toasts and all the code to the game, the gameActivity only has onCreate to create the view for the game. Any ideasp
Negative 34297 phave created a website that is displaying bookings from a database. Im only displaying 10 bookings per page, so I have created a pagination aswell. To get the bookings you have to set an ID, and I made everything work if I code the ID directly into the phpfile. The thing Im trying to do now is to get a selectform, so the user is able to select the ID by its own.p  pI created a selectform where I display all the IDs as options and Im able to choose an ID and get out bookings, but when I press the next button everything disappears. If I now choose the ID again and update the page, then all the bookings for page 2 will appear. It seems like the values reset to default, but I want them to stay the same everytime you press Next. How can I solve this Very thankful for any helpp  pIn page1 this will display the ID, when I press Next and enter page2 it echoes no id selectedp  precodeifissethejsann[Option]      echo hejsann[Option]  else       echo no id selected  codepre  pThis is the selectform where I choose the IDp  precodeltform methodpostgt ltfieldsetgt ltselect nametaskOption requiredgt ltoption value disabled selectedgtChoose a groupltoptiongt ltphp       if issetPOST[taskOption]           Option  POST[taskOption]             whilehej lt counthejsan              ifhejPOST[taskOption]                selected  selectedselected              else                selected                         echo ltoption value . hej .  .selected .gt . hejsan[hej] . ltoptiongt         hej           gt ltselectgt ltinput typesubmit valueFind bookingsgt ltfieldsetgt ltformgt codepre  pThis is the paginationp  precodeltphp var  POST[taskOption] book  bookingshejsann[var]  page  int GET[page] if page lt 1 page  1  resultsPerPage  10 startResults  page  1  resultsPerPage numberOfRows  countbook totalPages  ceilnumberOfRows  resultsPerPage  output  arrayslicebook, startResults, resultsPerPage  b  0 whileb lt countoutput  echo output[b] b   ifpage gt 1  echo lta hrefpage.page  1.gtltspangtBackltspangtltagtampnbsp   fori  1 i lt totalPages i  ifi  page     echo ltstronggt.i.ltstronggtampnbsp else     echo lta hrefpage.i.gtltspan stylemarginleft 15pxgt.i.ltspangt    ltagtampnbsp   if page lt totalPages  echo lta hrefpage.page  1.gtltspan stylemarginleft 15pxgtNextltspangtltagtampnbsp   ifpage  totalPages ampamp page gt 1  echo lta hrefpage1gtltspan stylemarginleft 15pxgtFirstltspangtltagtampnbsp  gt codepre

Now I dont want repetition of these ids irrespective of the rebate entry to which they belong. That is every rebate entry must have different product ids under key code[products]code. To achieve this I think each product id from each rebate entry should be compared with others. May be my approach is wrong. When you come across first match of product ids, error message should display as Please select different products and when not a single match found after comparing all the product ids with each other, the success message should display as All the products are different.

Why it looks like good when I codeprintlncode or codepprintcode the value in the second function, but the codeforcode is not working...p  h2Update and Final Thoughtsh2  pAs answered for this question, the problem has to do with lazyness of the codeforcode function. Lets take the simplest example to illustrate what is going on.p  precodedefn test2 [values]   for [x values] println x  defn test1 [values]   doseq [x values]     test2 x codepre  pWhat happens there is that in codetest1code, every time that codedoseqcode iterate, then a new nonlazy sequence is being created. That means that they are accessible like any other collection during the looping. p  pcodedoseqcode should generally be used when you work with nonpure functions that may have side effects, or I think when you are playing with relatively small collections.p  pThen when codetest2code is called, the codeforcode will create a stronglazyseqstrong. That means that the sequence exists, but that it never did get realized so, each step hasnt been computed yet. As is, nothing will happen with these two functions, since none of the values returned by the codeforcode have been realized.p  pIf we want to keep this codedoseqcode and this codeforcode loops, then we have to make sure that codeforcode get realized in codetest2code. We can do this that wayp  precodedefn test2 [values]   doall for [x values] println x  defn test1 [values]   doseq [x values]     test2 x codepre  pThat codedoallcode does here, is to force the full realization of the sequence returned by the codeforcode loop. That way, we will end with the expected result.p  pAdditionally, we could realize the lazyseq returned by codeforcode using other functions likep  precodedefn test2 [values]   first for [x values] println x  defn test2 [values]   count for [x values] println x codepre  pNone of this make sense, but all of these examples for the realization of the lazyseq returned by the codeforcode.p  pAdditionally, we could have simply used two codedoseqcode like thisp  precodedefn test2 [values]   doseq [x values] println x  defn test1 [values]   doseq [x values]     test2 x codepre  pThat way, we dont use any lazyseq and so we dont have to realize anything since nothing is evaluated lazilly.p

Negative 34297 pthis is my situationp  pI am writing a data structure in C which consists of Nodes and Edges. Nodes are connected to other nodes by means of edges.p  pI have different types of nodes, such as text nodes, or int nodes. Text nodes are connected to text nodes and int nodes are connected to int nodes. I am using inheritance to implement the different types of nodes because it makes sense fundamentally, all nodes are connected to other nodes so Node is the base class, and TxtNode, IntNode are inherited classes which share the fundamental property of a node.p  pHowever, this gives me problems when I try to fetch a connected inherited node from an inherited node, because the fetching function function which retrieves a specific node connected to the calling node is defined in the base class Node. For example, calling this fetch function from TextNode returns me the base version of the TextNode, which lacks extra information.p  pI am not sure what would be the sensible coding practice to do here. I chose to code it this way because it didnt seem to make sense that I must define a different connection fetch function for all different types of nodes.p  pPlease let me know if there is any more information I can disclose.p  pHere is my code, I am trying to print an inherited nodes partner but it will result in printing the base node.p  pNode.cppp  precodeinclude Node.h include Edge.h  include common.h  include ltvectorgt include ltcassertgt include ltcstddefgt include ltstdint.hgt include ltiostreamgt  NodeNode      id  intptrtthis     edges.clear   int NodeconnectNode dst       establish link between calling node      and dst node, first linkage will      edge between each other, links after      increments strength. returns number of      links       fetch edge connecting this node and       dst node     Edge edge  findDstEdgedst       if the branch isnt established yet,      then make connection     if edgeNULL          establishConnectiondst, 1         return 0      else          edgegtstrengthenConnection         return 1         Edge NodefindDstEdgeNode dst       fetches edge corresponding      to destination node       walk through vector of edges to find      edge connecting to dst      vectorltEdgegtiterator iter  edges.begin  whileiteredges.end      Edge e  iter     Node partner  egtgetPartnerthis     if partnergtgetID  dstgtgetID         return e     iter           not found     return NULL   void NodeestablishConnectionNode dst, int str       low level node addition       establish a new edge between      nodes which dont know each other     Edge e  new Edgethis, dst, str     thisgtmanuallyConnecte     dstgtmanuallyConnecte   void NodemanuallyConnectEdge e      edges.pushbacke   ostreamamp operatorltltostreamamp stream,Node n       vectorltEdgegtiterator iter  n.edges.begin      whileitern.edges.end          Edge e  iter         stream ltlt e ltlt endl         iter           return stream  codepre  pNode.hp  precodeifndef NODEH define NODEH  include common.h  include ltvectorgt include ltstringgt include ltstdint.hgt  class Edge  using namespace std  class Node       protected     vectorltEdgegt edges     intptrt id    public     Node       manipulation     void establishConnectionNode dst,            int str     int connectNode dst     Edge findDstEdgeNode dst       fetchers     intptrt getID return id     vectorltEdgegt getEdges return edges      void manuallyConnectEdge e      friend ostreamamp operatorltltostreamamp stream, Node n   endif codepre  pTxtNode.cppp  precodeinclude TxtNode.h include Edge.h  include common.h  include ltiostreamgt  TxtNodeTxtNodechar c Node       c  c   ostreamamp operatorltltostreamamp stream, TxtNode tn       print out character of this TxtNode     stream ltlt char  ltlt tn.c ltlt endl     stream ltlt id  ltlt tn.id ltlt endl       print out all connections and its      strength     vectorltEdgegtiterator iter  tn.edges.begin      whileitertn.edges.end          Edge e  iter         stream ltlt e ltlt endl         iter           return stream  codepre  pEdge.cppp  precodeinclude Edge.h include Node.h  include common.h  include ltcassertgt include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  EdgeEdgeNode a, Node b, int str      nodea  a     nodeb  b     strength  str   void EdgestrengthenConnection      strength   Node EdgegetPartnerNode src      uint srcID  srcgtgetID     if nodeagtgetID  srcID         return nodeb     else if nodebgtgetID  srcID         return nodea     assertfalse   ostreamamp operatorltltostreamamp stream, Edge e      stream ltlt strength             ltlt e.strength            ltlt endl     stream ltlt nodea             ltlt e.nodeagtgetID            ltlt endl     stream ltlt nodeb             ltlt e.nodebgtgetID            ltlt endl     return stream  codepre  pCurrently I just have the code to print the ID which is an intptrt, because I found out that I cant access inherited classs member from base class.p  pI am inclined to access the inherited classs member from base class because the edge class deals with base node class.p

Negative 34297 pIve looked at a couple different questions on here that looked like they might answer my issue, like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1371143domaintopointtoasinglepageDomain to point to a single pagea but not quite.  Theyve gotten me close, but this is still not working for me, and I think the issue is likely how Joomla creates the SEF urls.  p  pI have a Joomla site mainsite.com for example and I have a new domain quiz.com for example.  I would like to have a masked redirect where new domain quiz.com points to a Joomla page I have off the mainsite  mainsite.comquiz, yet keep quiz.com as the address.  So quiz.com  mainsite.comquiz, but the domain quiz.com stays in the url bar.p  pSo in CPanel, I added the new site quiz.com as an addon domain.  It also created a directory for it under publichtmlquiz.com  In that directory, I have this in the .htacessp  precodeRewriteEngine on RewriteCond HTTPHOST quiz.com [OR] RewriteCond HTTPHOST www.quiz.com RewriteRule  httpmainsite.comquiz [R301,L] codepre  pWhat is happening is when I bring up quiz.com, it actually brings up quiz.comcgisysdefaultwebpage.cgi   There isnt even a cgisys bin in that folder  There is only a .htaccess file  Has anyone seen this or can offer any help  Anything would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks so muchp

Negative 34297 pIm designing a small application using strongSymfony2strong, with a strongDDDstrong domain conceived as a vendor. This allows me to abstract my domain by not making any assumptions on what uses it. Basically, this domain is a set of business entities and services which perform their internal stuff. The business operations are called from the outside Symfony controllers by simple strongfacadesstrong that do not expose anything from the domain.p  pNow, I would like to test my domain to validate its business rules. Given that this domain cant work on its own as it needs concrete repositories implementations, I set up my tests to use mocks of these repositories. My question is  stronghow can I validate all the domain actions which are performed internally strongp  pFor instance, suppose my domain is made of two entities  codeArticlecode and codeCategorycode. I can traverse an article to get its category, but I cant traverse a category to get its articles as it doesnt make sense in the context of my domain. Now, I have a business rule that states that strongwhenever a category is disabled, all the articles on this category should be disabled as wellstrong.p  pThe entry point for this action would be a codedisablecategorycode method on a codeCategoryFacadecode service. This action would first disable the category, then fetch all the articles of this category and disable them. p  pIf I call the codedisablecode action from a test case, I can validate that my category was correctly disabled as it is the actual object on which I am performing the test. But what about the articles  I dont have a codegetArticlescode method on my category, and since my domain only uses mocks as repositories, it wouldnt make any sense to fetch manually the articles and asserting on them.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe answer proposed below reminded me of something critical. Indeed, in my example, a category is to be considered as an AR as it has an existence outside the scope of an article. But since an article is an AR as well, it should be entirely responsible for its own consistency. That means that the deactivation of all articles linked to a category should not be initiated by a category service, as this service shouldnt know anything about articles. My choice will be the one proposed below  dispatch en event whenever a category is disabled, and perform deactivation on articles in a service which is inside the boundaries of my article.p

Negative 34297 pI am reading the Flask documentation and I read this p  blockquote   pOne of the design decisions in Flask was that simple tasks should be simple they should not take a lot of code and yet they should not limit you. Because of that, Flask has few design choices that some people might find surprising or unorthodox. For example, Flask uses threadlocal objects internally so that you dont have to pass objects around from function to function within a request in order to stay threadsafe. This approach is convenient, but requires a valid request context for dependency injection or when attempting to reuse code which uses a value pegged to the request. The Flask project is honest about threadlocals, does not hide them, and calls out in the code and documentation where they are used.p blockquote  pWhat does this mean Specifically the following questions  p  ul liWhat are thread local objects How and when they are used and what purpose do they solveli liHow using threadlocal objects internally ensure thread safety and how does passing objects to function result in notthreadsafeli liWhat is the meaning of a valid request context in this case li ul

Negative 34297 pI need to read the name of the recording device displayed in Windows properties,  soundrecording devices.

Negative 34297 pI have several message handlers in a particular endpoint that do their work against a SQL Azure database at the moment still using a local SQL 2012 instance.  I have a command handler that publishes 2 events, call them X and Y.  In the same endpoint I have a subscriber to X and a subscriber to Y.  Both of these subscribers are internally using the same data access component, call that Z.  Dependency injection is configured on a percall basis, not shared.p  pComponent Z is using Entity Framework 6 under the curtains.  The issue I am having is that just opening the database is throwing a SqlException and complaining about MSDTC escalations.p  pI have temporarily wrapped the handlers in a TransactionScope.Suppress and that has stopped the error but I believe Im missing something more fundamental.  p  pIs it a simple matter of configuring the endpoint to be nontransactional  I would have thought this would just work seeing as Ive configured to use Azure Service Bus as the transport mechanism.  If I do this will NServiceBus still retry if an exception is thrown within the message handler Up to the SLR limits  not part of the question, I also understand the idempotency issues.  p
Negative 34297 pI created a web application to clean up CSVTSV data. The app allows me to upload a CSV file, read it, fix data, and then download a new CSV file with the correct data. One challenge I have run into is downloading files with more than  2500 lines. The browser crashes with the following error messagep  precodeAw, Snap Something went wrong while displaying this webpage... codepre  pTo work around this I have changed the programming to download multiple CSV files not exceeding 2500 lines until all the data is downloaded. I would then put together the downloaded CSV files into a final file. Thats not the solution I am looking for. Working with files of well over 100,000 lines, I need to download all contents in 1 file, and not 40. I also need a frontend solution.p  pFollowing is the code for downloading the CSV file. I am creating a hidden link, encoding the contents of data array each element has 1000 lines and creating the path for the hidden link. I then trigger a click on the link to start the download.p  precodevar startDownload  function data     var hiddenElement  document.createElementa     var path  dataattachmenttsv,     for i0iltdata.lengthi         path  encodeURIdata[i]          hiddenElement.href  path     hiddenElement.target  blank     hiddenElement.download  result.tsv     hiddenElement.click  codepre  pIn my case the above process works for  2500 lines at a time. If I attempt to download bigger files, the browser crashes. What am I doing wrong, and how can I download bigger files without crashing the browser The file that is crashing the browser has 12,000 rows by 48 columnsp  pp.s. I am doing all of this in Google Chrome, which allows for file upload. So the solution should work in Chrome.p

If I pull out the X509Certificate block in the assertion and decode it using a website like a hrefhttpwww.sslshopper.comcertificatedecoder.html relnofollowhttpwww.sslshopper.comcertificatedecoder.htmla, I can see the info it contains.p  pI have example code running so far that tests whether or not the XML signature and cert is valid.  It currently is not.  However, nothing in the code refers to the .pem file.p  pSo what am I supposed to do with the .pem file that has been provided  Any hintsp  pemUPDATEem Okay, I am continuing to try to solve my own problem.  As I mentioned, the .pem file I have contains 2 cert blocks, so I decoded them to see the contents.  The first one contains info about the Identity Provider.  The second contains info about DigiCert Inc.p  pI am beginning to think that the purpose of the IDP cert in the .pem file is simply to match against the one sent within the XML assertion itself as a primary security check.  Is that rightp

Negative 34297 pI dont think the issue is isolated solely to my JSPs. However, the current files Im trying to edit are JSPs. p  pWhenever I make changes to my JSP, I save the file in Eclipse, cleanrepublish my JBoss server, start the server, and access the application localhost, yet the changes I made are not reflected on the page at all. p  pI go to the JBoss temp directory to see exactly what version of the file that Im editing the server is currently using. I always see that its using the original version that I pulled down from the original repo. I have no idea why its not changing. p  pI tried recloning and reimporting everything just out of desperation, and Im getting the same results. p  pIn addition, strangely, when I run the command codemvn U clean package DskipTeststruecode to do a commandline build using Maven, my file reverts back to the originalunchanged version. New to Maven, so its strange to me at least. p  pSo, essentially any changes I am making to files for my project arent being reflected on my local test server. Im totally stumped as to why its behaving like this.p

Negative 34297 pId like to record some mouse interaction with a web page, or more specifically, with a canvas element on that web page. So interacting with various web elements will be of little use, and instead interacting with the canvas with fine position control is essential.p  pFor a while I was looking at the a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniuminteractionsMouse.html relnofollowcodeMousecodea interface. I was somewhat surprised that I could provide offset for movement, but not for codemouseDowncode and codemouseUpcode. It also took me a while to figure out that I can probably turn a a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniumWebElement.html relnofollowcodeWebElementcodea into a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniuminteractionsinternalCoordinates.html relnofollowcodeCoordinatescodea by casting it to the a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniuminternalLocatable.html relnofollowcodeLocatablecodea interface first.p  pBut codeLocatablecode and codeCoordinatescode are in a package called codeinternalcode. Eventually with the help of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq97357191468366this questiona I learned about a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniuminteractionsActions.html relnofollowcodeActionscodea. Its documentation statesp  blockquote   pThe userfacing API for emulating complex user gestures. Use this class rather than using the Keyboard or Mouse directly.p blockquote  pSo it seems that I should be using this. Expressing my movement in that context seems easy enough. But what has me worried is timing. Id like to move objects approximately at the same speed I used when recording. Im not aiming to exactly reproduce timing, but some mouse actions will trigger computations in a timer step, so the interaction between mouse events and timer should be simulated in a natural fashion.p  pI see no codewaitcode or codesleepcode method in codeActionscode. What I do see is a codepausecode method, but that has been deprecated. The deprecation message readsp  blockquote   pPause is considered to be a bad design practice.p blockquote  pThe a hrefhttpscode.google.compseleniumsourcedetailra7d53122fd86ea268078fbd125bcaa45ab124f57 relnofollowcommita adding that deprecation has no more detail either.p  ul liWhy is codepausecode considered bad designli liCan I expect drivers to support this command despite the deprecationli liDo I have to fear that this command will vanish soonli liHow else should I implement timing of mouse movementli ul  pThere appears to be plenty of places where some form of waiting can be realized. a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniumsupportuiWebDriverWait.html relnofollowcodeWebDriverWaitcodea and a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniumWebDriver.Timeouts.html relnofollowcodeWebDriver.Timeoutscodea seem the most likely candidates. But would it really be preferable to perform codeActionscode consisting of a single mouse move, and interleave them with waits Particularly if I might be remote controlling some machine over a slow link Interleaving codepausecode statements in a long codeActionscode sequence seemed so much more reasonable to me.p  pemEdit 1em Looking at a hrefhttpscode.google.compseleniumsourcebrowsejavaclientsrcorgopenqaseleniuminteractionsPauseAction.java relnofollowthe sourcesa I see that codeActions.pausecode is simply implemented using codeThread.sleepcode. So the delay is only local, and network latency over a bad link might severely distort timing. I also found two bug reports regarding codeActions.pausecode, a hrefhttpscode.google.compseleniumissuesdetailid7424 relnofollowonea requesting that it not be deprecated and a hrefhttpscode.google.compseleniumissuesdetailid7646 relnofollowanothera reuqesting an alternative. The latter comes with a proofofconcept implementation building on codeWebDriverWaitcode. But looking at that, it bases its timing on codeClockcode and the only implementation of that interface is codeSystemClockcode so it appears that again all timing is controlled clientside. What wed need would be some onthewire command for a serverside delay, I think.p

Then compare those values to 180 seconds or 230 for 3 minutes and 50 seconds.The reason Im extracting the seconds digit is because I might need to show the codeUIAlertViewcode at 0350.000. p  pI can change the format of my timer to make extracting the digits easier or update my timer less frequently, however, that will bring a lot of changes to my program, which is not possible at the moment. p  pHow can I extract the digits or check if the timer has been running for a given time e.g. 0350.000p

Negative 34297 pI have this excel template, which contains information about the different groups of hub customers name of locations linked with certain product and production line. As the customer locations is not linked with any sale order or any dates, so I made this as combo boxes which bounded with the one location table in the database. p  pBut the problems is sometime they will receive the updates as filled in the excel templates. They wish to optimize the format of the template, so it easier for the set up and maintenance. And they dont use MS Access and wish to keep the atomized updating process. p  pSo is that possible for me to update the access linked combo box with the excel template And which could be the good format for the template used in the future Any advice is appreciatedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2lyxS.gif altenter image description herep
Negative 34297 pIve problem with modauthnzsspi and 32bit WAMP Apache 2.4.4, PHP 5.4.12, MySQL 5.6.12. We have a domain and I wanted to users login in web app through SSO. Ive tested the extension on dev computer Win Server 2008 R2 and got it working perfectly. After that I created another virtual host on production server Win Server 2012 and included modauthnzsspi extension in Apache and tested it  it worked perfectly. After awhile web app users started to get login prompts in their web browser we are using latest Chrome.p  pI was surprised because I didnt change any settings. Same app works flawlessly on dev computer. So I copied the whole Wamp folder its the same version as in dev computer and I accessed app with SSO without a problem.p  pSo, any help is appreciated as I have no more ideas.p  pP.S.

Negative 34297 pI have written an iOS 16channel General MIDI tone generator using an AUGraph, and it works great with some DLSs and sound fonts, and sounds terrible with others.  With some DLSs and sound fonts, I can play a sequence and get essentially the same sound as I do in other iOS apps e.g. bs16i with the same sequence using the same DLS or sound font but with others, I get a much worse sound quality than with the other app, notes that dont sound, etc.not even close to acceptable.  Its particularly surprising since the difference in quality exists only for some DSLs and sound fontsso what Im doing works for some, but is not sufficient for others.p  pBelow are two functions codenewAUGraphcode creates an AUGraph consisting of 16 AUSamplers one for each channel, each with an output to a mixer, which combines the 16 channels and routes them to a reverb unit, which then sends the sounds to the output unit the AUGraph and the sixteen AUSamplers are stored in the external global variables codeAuGraphcode and codeauSampler[16]code.  The second funtction codeloadAUSamplerPreset code loads one of the 16 AUSamplers with a patch youll notice that the first function uses this function to initialize each of the sixteen channels to patch 0 which, in General MIDI is the grand piano sound for most channels, and the basic drum kit for channel 9.  Notes and other MIDI messages are subsequently sent to the appropriate AUSampler using codeMusicDeviceMIDIEventcode, or codeMusicDeviceSysExcode for nonchannelized MIDI messages.p  pHere is the code for the two functions described above.  If anybody has the time to slog through these, Id be grateful for any hint of what I might be doing wrong here.

Negative 34297 pI just installed a HDFS cluster using Cloudera Manager 5CM5 with its default settings in three nodes n1.example.com, n2.example.com and n3.example.com. The virtualization of the nodes were done in Parallels Mac OSX 10.10.1 Yosemite. I am able to see the HDFS system using sudo h hdfs  within any of the nodes.p  pNow, I am trying to access the HDFS system from my ETL tool that are on the host OS Mac OSX using the default IDPasswordport, hdfsblank8020. But I get Connection Refused. Ive attached the screenshot of the ETL.p  pSo, Ive installed the ETL tool Pentaho Kettle on the n2 node and tried connecting using localhost from the Server but still not working either with a Connection Refused error. When I use command like such as sudo u hdfs hadoop fs ls , it works fine though.p  pAm I missing anythingp  pFYI, Ive already disabled the firewall in those three nodes since they are actually running in my virtual machine environment as a test.p  pThank youp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNgmAg.png altHDFS connection dialogp

Negative 34297 pI program mostly in  .NET and I love its asyncconcurrency primitives such as Tasks, ResetEvents, etc. Today for the first time I made meaningful changes to a C program and understood how the whole build process works I a hrefhttpsgithub.combuybackoffLMDB.NET relnofollowupdateda LigthningDB.NET project to 0.9.14. But I still lack C knowledge.p  pOne new feature that I want to add to the LMDB project for my own needs is a notification system similar to Redisp  ul liI want a cursor returning an awaitable object that will signal on every data change in its table. li liI want to get some data together with the signal a pointer to a data structure, e.g. key or key  value.li liThis object will be disposed together with the cursor and is a part of the cursor, but it signals on changes in a DB for which the cursor has a reference.li liThis must work cross platform some day or some year. I am OK with any dirty Windowsspecific hacks if they do the job.li ul  pTypical use case is a writer and N readers waiting for new messages. This will allow IPC and fast persistence 2in1. LMDB supports concurrent reading from different processes while Esent and LevelDB do not.p  pcodeSystem.Threadingcode primitives are available from C and I understand how to use WaitHandle for a blocking call.

After the signal a C listener will know that the cursor has values at the updated key. This kinf of solves data transfer part, but with WaitHandles it is blocking  in my use case blocking is worse than the sockets [allocationcopydelay] combination.p  pAre there better optionsp  pAdditional questionsp  ol liAm I reinventing a bicycle hereli liCould you please point to open source libraries where .NET program awaits nonblocking for a CC signal if they existli liShould I use LMDB for that workflow Windows in my priority and I have had very bad time trying to make LevelDB work at all stopped trying.

Negative 34297 pI have been fighting this for over 2 weeks now with no light at the end of the tunnel. I have a patcher system for a game server that I host and it requires downloading .dat files for the updatelist as well as the version. I am using Server 2008 with IIS 7 and running php version 5.3.1. I have tried manually adding the mime type to web.config as many tutorials have stated and also have added it to IIS with the Mime selection there. Still I cannot download the file and it gives me an error 404 File or Directory not found in the website. I have tried using the wildcard settings by using  for the mime type. I even tried using just . for the Mime type without the quote of course. I have even attempted to use the appcmd setup as in many tutorials. Now I have all proper permissions in the folder that the files are being hosted in because I can download any zip file or text file ect..., so I am sure that is not the problem. If anyone has any other solution that I may try I am all ears. Thank you and god bless.p

Negative 34297 pI just read this excellent article a hrefhttpneugierig.orgsoftwarechromiumnotes201108staticinitializers.html relnofollowhttpneugierig.orgsoftwarechromiumnotes201108staticinitializers.htmla and then I tried a hrefhttpsgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgccintInitialization.html relnofollowhttpsgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgccintInitialization.htmlap  pWhat it says about finding initializers does not work for me though. The code.ctorscode section is not available, but I could find code.initarraycode see also a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16569495cantfinddtorsandctorsinbinaryCan39t find .dtors and .ctors in binarya. But how do I interpret the output I mean, summing up the size of the pages can also be handled by the codesizecode command and its code.bsscode column  or am I missing somethingp  pFurthermore, codenmcode does not report any codeGLOBALIcode symbols, only codeGLOBALNcode functions, and  more interesting  codeGLOBALsubIsomefile.cppcode entries. The latter probably indicates files with global initialization. But can I somehow get a list of constructors that are being run Ideally, a tool would give me a list ofp  precodeFooFoo in file1.cpp12 BarBar in file2.cpp45 ... codepre  passuming I have debug symbols available. Is there such a tool If not, how could one write it Does the code.initarraycode section contain pointers to code which could be translated via some DWARF magic to the abovep

Negative 34297 pIm having a really hard time nailing down a problem coming from NHibernate 3.3. The application serves some 150 reqs in a six node NLB cluster. The application behaves ok generally, but sometimes maybe 12 day the following error comes in the logs and all queries fail. p  pIm using codeadonet.batchsizecode of 15 and codeMultipleActiveResultSetsTruecode is set to true. All controllers inherit from codeAsyncControllercode this is an ASP.NET MVC 4 app, so session state is read only to maximize concurrency.p  pInitially, we had a lot of trouble NHibernate Session handling because the codeAbstractBatchercode did  a pretty poor job managing which readers were related to which connection. So, in a high load, readers would try to read from connections that were already closed.  We solved this by defining manually the lifetime of a SQLConnection which stabilized things. p  pHowever, the following comes up often. I think it is a symptom of something really wrong with the session factory. At this point, Im thinking about reinitializing the session factory when an unhandled exception of this type is thrown, but thats not nice.

Negative 34297 pI have a strange problem with my project. I decided to write the server application in Spring and a frontend with AngularJS. On the server side, I have a simple controller which return some simple data, from simple Entity . It looks like thisp  precodeRestController public class ApiController      RequestMapping value  getAllProfiles, method  RequestMethod.GET     public Entity getEntity              Entity e  new Entity         e.setName myname          return e       codepre  pOn the front side, I have an Angulars controller, which looks likep  precodevar app  angular.moduleapp, []  app.configfunctionhttpProvider      httpProvider.defaults.useXDomain  true        delete httpProvider.defaults.headers.common[XRequestedWith]   app.controllerHello, function scope, http      http.get         method GET,         url httplocalhost8080getAllProfiles     .successfunction data          console.logsuccess, data         scope.greeting  data     .errorfunction         console.logsomething goes wrong       codepre  pand html filep  precodelthtml ngappappgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtHello AngularJSlttitlegt     ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsangularjs1.3.12angular.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srcview1.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv ngcontrollerHellogt     ltpgtThe content is greeting.nameltpgt ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pWhen I start server, I connect to the localhost8080getAllProfiles and everything works well. I receive JSON like this codenamemynamecode. But, when I try to do the same from the Angular side, I receive codeThe content iscode  an empty data from server and, of course, error function is calling in the controller. I thought it can be a CORS problem, but I added filters on server side, and on the Angular side and it didnt help. The js console Im using Chrome says Failed to load resource the server responded with a status of 404 Not Foundp  pI really dont know what to do with this. I want to talk between this two applications, but I cannot because of this. If someone can help me with this, I will be very thankful.p

If the app is uninstalled, then all these contacts should be removed.p  pAfter reading the Android documentation, I have created a SyncAdapter and ContentProvider.

My ContentProvider is yet a dummy.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFRlZw.png altAndroid contact accountsp  pThe first thing I would like to do is manually saving a contact by using my own sync account.

Negative 34297 pMy question originates from a task I have been given that has had me stumped. I have been given a large tree structure that I need to turn into a series of dependant dropdown or something similar. The end goal is to form a means of user input in an excel spread sheet.p  pI am using Excel 2010 and as such would prefer to avoid VBA.p  pSo far Ive managed to cut down the number of lists by using a drop down for the first two generations in the tree and then two successive vlookups. The next generation however needs to move back to a drop down menu. p  pIs it possible to use the SUBSTITUTE and CONCATENATE functions as a mean of referencing a unique table name within excel. The purpose of this would be to populate a dropdown validation list. p  pe.g. If cells A1C1 are defined asp  precodeA1  Food B1  Fruit C1  Apples D1  ltEmpty, result heregt codepre  pAnd I apply the aforementioned functionsp  precodeD1  SUBSTITUTECONCATENATEA1,B1,C1, , codepre  pI will get the output p  precodeD1  FoodFruitApples codepre  pNow say I have a list with the name FoodFruitApplesp  precodeGranny Smith Golden Delicious Pink Lady codepre  pHow could I create a cell containing a drop down list with the table FoodFruitApples Ideally this would all be contained within cell D1 without any hidden columns.p  pThis is my first time posing an excel related question so I apologise if my terminology and question structure is off.

Negative 34297 pI working on AJAX and PHP validation program but am unable to write the data to the working mySQL DB.p  pIm building a new user member form for a project and have usedmade a basic PHPMySQL form that worked well for me in the past. Now I am trying to upgrade to using AJAX due to the length of my newest form and wanting to make it as easy as possible for those visiting my site as well as always making improvements beyond my current skill level thus always making it harder for myself.p  pI wound up using the example here a hrefhttpswww.packtpub.comsitesdefaultfiles7726ajaxandphpsamplechapter5ajaxformvalidation.pdf relnofollowhttpswww.packtpub.comsitesdefaultfiles7726ajaxandphpsamplechapter5ajaxformvalidation.pdfap  pAnd it works very well. The problem Im having is extracting the data out to actually place into my DB. I am using a mySQL DB that I know is working and am currently using.p  pWhen I add things I believe should work to the validate.class.php page it halts that operation or returns errors. Also adding anything seems to break the AJAX validation. When I try to use the variables else where they come back empty.p  pIm not seeing what I am expecting to see when it comes to being able to INSERT from the validated form variables. If this makes any sense.p  pI mostly have coded embedded projects using microcontrollers and I also like Perl. I have some experience putting together some basic things before using php and mysql and feel comfortable with programming but Im at a loss on this one. I usually do well jumping in and figuring my way through p  pIf someone could point me in the right direction it would be very appreciated.p
Negative 34297 pIm working on compiling a bunch of tweets for an information retrieval class. Im trying this using both the REST API and the Streaming API through twitter4j.

If my understanding is correct, this is because the TwitterStream class creates a new thread which runs concurrently with the codemaincode thread. Then, the codemaincode thread closes the stream and the codetwitterStreamcode can no longer write to it.p  pIf thats the case, where should I close my writerp

Negative 34297 pbr I just recently started with iOS development. The only thing is that I am trying to develop apps Models, Views, Controllers 100 programmatically, which means that I do not use Storyboards or xib files. I do it because I need to get an understanding how app works internally where it starts, how it goes from one view controller to another, how everything is connected, where from all the files are loaded. Of course, later Ill start all the features XCode suggests.br However, I think there is a problem that I am constantly hitting and for which I could not find an answer since there are not that many sample codes published for apps created programmatically. Usually, an example explains how to use, lets say a UINavigationBar or UITableView, but puts all of them into emAppDelegate.mem file, what I do not really like since it kills all the idea of MVC. So, here is my questionbr I figured out that app starts execution at emmain.mem file and then goes to emAppDelegate.mem. So, I put my window and rootViewController initialization there. But, emwhich view controller should I put really as a root view controllerem I am not creating anything fancy, and usually I am satisfied with default implementations, so it does not really make sense to inherit from base class. So, what should I do in this case Where should I put all my configurations and settings Should I really put it in my emAppDelegateem filebr Here is an example. I am trying to create Checklist app brbmain.mbbrp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import AppDelegate.h  int mainint argc, char  argv[]      autoreleasepool          return UIApplicationMainargc, argv, nil,     NSStringFromClass[AppDelegate class]       codepre  pbr strongAppDelegate.h has default interface, so AppDelegate.mstrong brbrp  precodeimport AppDelegate.h import MainTableViewController.h     implementation AppDelegate    BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions   [self setWindow[[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]]]  MainTableViewController tablevc  [[MainTableViewController alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewStylePlain] [[self window] setRootViewControllertablevc] return YES  end codepre  pstrongMainTableViewController.hstrongp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt interface MainTableViewController  UITableViewController end codepre  pstrongMainTableViewController.mstrongp  precodeimport MainTableViewController.h implementation MainTableViewController   voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      put my code here   pragma mark  Table view data source   NSIntegernumberOfSectionsInTableViewUITableView tableView  warning Potentially incomplete method implementation.      Return the number of sections.     return 0    NSIntegertableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSection    NSIntegersection  warning Incomplete method implementation.      Return the number of rows in the section.     return 0  end codepre  pWhat if I want to set actually different views depending on the content Lets say if the tableview is empty I want to put a UILabel with text No todo item, and if there is at least one entry, I want to display the tableview Should I be just handling different views in emViewDidLoadem and emViewWillAppearem br Thank you.p

Negative 34297 pA Promise is an object type which serves as a placeholder for a future result, such as the body of an HTTP request, or the return value of a Meteor method call. Basically any function that forces you to pass a callback to recieve its return value instead of just returning it is said to be an async function, and the value it gives back can be represented by a Promise.p  pThe issue in Meteor is that codehelpercode methods are only intended to work with synchronous values  such as the text in a web page, or the contents of a  Minimongo collection. When you return a Promise from one, the helperp  ul lishows code[object Promise]code instead of the resolved valueli lidoes not update when the promise resolvesli ul  pSome attempts at solving this exist a hrefhttpsatmospherejs.comsimplereactivemethodsimplereactivemethoda and a hrefhttpsatmospherejs.comarsnebulareactivepromisearsnebulareactivepromisea, but they require you to change your helpers to a certain style, or only work with codeMeteor.callcode instead of just simply allowing a generic promise to be returned. p  pIs there something existing Ive overlooked, or is there a solution in the works Ive been experimenting with this for some time, and may work on something myself if theres not an official answer.p

Negative 34297 pThis is what I am thinking codegrepcode program tries to patternmatch every pattern occurrence in the line, just likep  precodeecho abc abc abc  grep abc color codepre  pthe result is that the three codeabccode is all red colored, so grep did a full pattern matching to the line.p  pBut think in this scenario, I have many big files to process, but the words that I am interested is very much likely to occur in the first few words. My job is to find the lines without the words in them. So if the codegrepcode program can continue to the next line when the words have been found without having to check the rest of the line, it would maybe significantly faster. p  pIs there a codepartial matchcode option maybe in grep to do thisp  plikep  precodeecho abc abc abc  grep partial abc color codepre  pwith only the first abc colored red.p

Negative 34297 pI have ran in to an unexpected issue with MySQL 5.6.23 Community Server  where changing the list of fields in my select statement is changing the query execution plan and having a dramatic impact on the query performance.p  pI think the best way to demonstrate the problem is by way of example. If I create two simple tablesp  precodecreate table table1    id INT AUTOINCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,   random INT,   value INT,   KEY value   create table table2    id INT AUTOINCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,   table1 INT,   random INT,   CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY table1 REFERENCES table1 id  codepre  pand then populate them with basic data the procedure I used for doing this is at the bottom of the question  I can then compare the performance of the following two queriesp  precodemysqlgt select t1.id, t2.id from table2 t2 join table1 t1 on t2.table1t1.id where t1.value  1 order by t2.id desc limit 1   id       id          1109700  11097000   1 row in set 1.23 sec  mysqlgt select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random from table2 t2 join table1 t1 on t2.table1t1.id where t1.value  1 order by t2.id desc limit 1   id       random  id        random    1109700  749465  11097000  538840   1 row in set 4.06 sec codepre  pNote that the only difference between these two queries is the inclusion of the two random fields in the select statement  yet it is over three times slower. Also note that I have cleared the linux disk cache via codeecho 3  sudo tee procsysvmdropcachescode and innodb buffer pool by restarting mysql before executing each queryp  pHere are the query plans for these two queriesp  precodemysqlgt desc select t1.id, t2.id from table2 t2 join table1 t1 on t2.table1t1.id where t1.value  1 order by t2.id desc limit 1   id  selecttype  table  type  possiblekeys  key     keylen  ref         rows   Extra                                            1  SIMPLE       t1     ref   PRIMARY,value  value   5        const       22312  Using index Using temporary Using filesort    1  SIMPLE       t2     ref   table1         table1  5        test.t1.id      4  Using index                                    2 rows in set 0.00 sec  mysqlgt desc select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random from table2 t2 join table1 t1 on t2.table1t1.id where t1.value  1 order by t2.id desc limit 1   id  selecttype  table  type  possiblekeys  key     keylen  ref         rows   Extra                               1  SIMPLE       t1     ref   PRIMARY,value  value   5        const       22312  Using temporary Using filesort    1  SIMPLE       t2     ref   table1         table1  5        test.t1.id      4  NULL                              2 rows in set 0.00 sec codepre  pSo the inclusion of the random fields in the select statement seems to cause the query plan to drop the use of indexes thats my reading of the Extra column anyway.p  pI should point out  that whilst in the example above the performance difference is three fold  on my production database the impact is far more pronounced at closer to 40 times slower. This is because the size of the tables in production are far greater and the table indexes are generally cached but the record data is not.p  pIve considered a work around  once I have the output of the first query  I can run the followingp  precodemysqlgt select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random from table2 t2 join table1 t1 on t2.table1t1.id where t1.value  1 and t2.id  11097000 order by t2.id desc   id       random  id        random    1109700  749465  11097000  538840   1 row in set 0.01 sec codepre  pFor completeness  Ive included the procedure I used to populate the table data note you might want to alter the value of coderowstoinsertcode if you plan to run this yourself  1,000,000 rows took four hours for mep  precodeDELIMITER  CREATE PROCEDURE randomfill BEGIN     DECLARE counter1, counter2, table1id, rowstoinsert INT      SET counter1  0     SET rowstoinsert  1000000      label1 LOOP         SET counter1  counter1  1          INSERT INTO table1  random, value  VALUES  CEIL RAND  rowstoinsert , CEIL RAND  99           SET table1id  LASTINSERTID          SET counter2  0         label2 LOOP            SET counter2  counter2  1             INSERT INTO table2  table1, random  VALUES   table1id, CEIL RAND  rowstoinsert              IF counter2 lt 10 THEN               ITERATE label2            END IF            LEAVE label2         END LOOP label2          IF counter1 lt rowstoinsert THEN            ITERATE label1         END IF         LEAVE label1     END LOOP label1 END DELIMITER  codepre  hr  pstrongUPDATE 0909strongp  pI should point out that Ive only included the one column in my example to keep it simple. In my production environment  the table in question has 69 columns. We are also using Hibernate  which will select all 69 columns in its select statement. As a result  a covering index is not practical.p  pMy expectation was for MySQL to recognise that  through the use of the limit 1 clause  I only need data from 1 row and therefore it wouldp  ol  1. Use the indexed values to find the PRIMARY KEY for this one 1 row andbr  2. Go to the disk to only read the value for this 1 row. ol  pInstead it seems to be scanning the data for every row on disk  making the query particularly expensive I dont know for sure this is what it is doing  but something is causing a three second delay when I ask for the values of those two additional columns.p  pI tried the same example described above on PostGres and found it was doing what I had expected from MySQL and was strongincrediblystrong fast over 200 times fasterp  precode     select  t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random     from  table2 t2     join  table1 t1 on t2.table1t1.id     where  t1.value  1     order by  t2.id desc     limit  1     id    random    id     random    999984  614113  9999840  622718 1 row  Time 17.973 ms codepre  pHeres the query plan from PostGresp  precode explain select t1.id, t1.random, t2.id, t2.random from table2 t2 join table1 t1 on t2.table1t1.id where t1.value  1 order by t2.id desc limit 1                                                   QUERY PLAN                                                      Limit  cost0.86..599.14 rows1 width16    gt  Nested Loop  cost0.86..63819201.12 rows106672 width16          gt  Index Scan Backward using table2pkey on table2 t2  cost0.43..313745.06 rows10000175 width12          gt  Index Scan using table1pkey on table1 t1  cost0.42..6.34 rows1 width8                Index Cond id  t2.table1                Filter value  1 6 rows  Time 2.407 ms codepre  pSo you can see it uses the indexes to find the right row and then reads the data for just this one row.p  pIs there a way I can force MySQL to take the same approachp  pOr will I need to put a work around in the code i.e. get the primary index first and then get Hibernate to fetch this one rowp  hr  pstrongUPDATE 20150912strongp  pOK  I think I understand what you are saying. The codeUsing indexcode statement means that MySQL is emonlyem using the index. That it doesnt need to go to the data to get the values for the resultset. In otherwords  codeUsing indexcode indicates MySQL is using a covering index with id  the codePRIMARY KEYcode  being implicitly included in the value key.p  pSo actually I was interpreting that wrong. I originally thought that it meant the use of indexes had been abandoned all together.p  pHere is the result from the codeSHOW SESSION STATUS LIKE Handlercode the output was the same for both queriesp  precode  Variablename               Value     Handlercommit              1        Handlerdelete              0        Handlerdiscover            0        Handlerexternallock       4        Handlermrrinit            0        Handlerprepare             0        Handlerreadfirst          0        Handlerreadkey            11158    Handlerreadlast           0        Handlerreadnext           122727   Handlerreadprev           0        Handlerreadrnd            1        Handlerreadrndnext       111571   Handlerrollback            0        Handlersavepoint           0        Handlersavepointrollback  0        Handlerupdate              0        Handlerwrite               111570   18 rows in set 0.25 sec codepre  pBut thanks to your explanation I think I now have a better understanding of the explain output from MySQL. For the second query it isp  ol liStarting with table1 and the value key. Using this key it finds all the t1.id values from rows that match the codet1.value  1code criteria then itli liFinds all the table2 values that have a table1 value in the set returned by step 1. Its taking care of the codet2.table1t1.idcode criteriali ol  pSo the last bit that needs to be satisfied is the codeorder by t2.id desccode clause and application of the codelimit 1code clause. And its here that I think MySQL could do better. Its creating a temporary table and then doing a filesort. But it appears to be getting the values for all the rows before making the temporary table. But because the codeorder bycode clause is on a codePRIMARY KEYcode  technically it doesnt need to get the data yet. It could satisfy the codeorder bycode clause, then apply the codelimitcode clause and then fetch the data required to complete the resultset.

Your assistance has been invaluable. With my new knowledge Ive been able to optimise a number of existing queries.p  pFor anyone who is reading this having ran in to the same problem  heres a summary of the problem and a means for resolution.p  pThe simple yet problematic query being generated by Hibernate wasp  precodeselect tran.id as id131, tran.deleted as deleted131, joinitem1.id as id90 from tran tran inner join item joinitem1 on tran.itemjoinitem1.id where joinitem1.itemType120 order by tran.id desc limit 100 codepre  pNote that Ive reduced the number of fields in the select list and changed the table names to make the example easier to read and more relevant.p  pI have 17,286,852 rows in codetrancode and 971,020 in codeitemcode with 105 different item types.p  pThe above query took 20 min 47.32 sec to execute. Way, emwayem too long.p  pThe reason it took so long is because of the order MySQL is processing the steps. It wouldp  ol liFirst use the index on codeitemTypecode within the codeitemcode table to find all the items of the right type codewhere itemType120codeli liThen use the index on codeitemcode in the codetrancode table for the codejoincode codejoin item on tran.itemitem.idcodeli liIt would then not sure of order  ul lia load the data from every column of every row hit so far andli lib sort based on codetran.id desccodeli ulli liReduce the resultset based on the codelimit 100code clauseli ol  pTherefore, at step 3a  it is loading a lot of data that isnt in the final resultset. There are 69 columns in the codetrancode table  and prior to applying the codelimitcode clause  this resultset has 376,652 rows. Its a very expensive and unnecessary IO exercisep  pOnce I understood this  I recognised that step 3a should be applied after step 4. I wanted the order of execution to bep  ol liFirst use the index on codeitemTypecode within the codeitemcode table to find all the items of the right type codewhere itemType120codeli liThen use the index on codeitemcode in the codetrancode tableli liSort based on codetran.id desccodeli liReduce the resultset based on the codelimit 100code clauseli liLoad the data from every column for the remaining 100 rows avoiding the need to load the other 376,552 rowsli ol  pNote that this order can only be achieved if all the fields used from steps 1 to 4 are included in the indexes used by the query plan. In my example they are with codetran.idcode being implicitly included in the codetran.itemcode index.p  pTo get MySQL to do this  you first want to do steps 1 through 5 with only indexed values in your select list so your query plan will show codeUsing indexcode at each step. For example only the select clause is changedp  precodeselect tran.id as id131 from tran tran inner join item joinitem1 on tran.itemjoinitem1.id where joinitem1.itemType120 order by tran.id desc limit 100 codepre  pI can then use this resultset as a derived table to feed my original query bothp  ul lithe 100 rows I need andli litheir order.li ul  pFor examplep  precodeselect tran.id as id131, tran.deleted as deleted131, joinitem1.id as id90 from tran tran inner join item joinitem1 on tran.itemjoinitem1.id inner join select tran.id as id131             from tran tran             inner join item joinitem1 on tran.itemjoinitem1.id             where joinitem1.itemType120             order by tran.id desc             as ids limit 100 codepre  pBe sure to remove the codeorder bycode clause from your outer query. Otherwise MySQL falls back in to its bad habits. The codewherecode clause is no longer necessary in the outer. The codelimit 100code clause can actually be on the inner or outer query.p  pThe query plan for this new query shows the the derived table being created using only index values. It then completes the outer query by starting with codetran.idcode  so it can quickly find and only load the 100 rows.p  pYou might think that I may as well have written the query like sop  precodeselect tran.id as id131 from tran tran force key PRIMARY straightjoin item joinitem1 on tran.itemjoinitem1.id where joinitem1.itemType120 order by tran.id desc limit 100 codepre  pAnd you would be right  this is much quicker. But only when the 100 rows I need are in the top half of the codetrancode table. It quickly becomes inferior if, for example, I change the limit clause to codelimit 376552, 100code which took 46 min 11.87 sec to execute.p  pHowever  you cant I dont think create derived tables in hibernate. You can eitherp  ul lia convert the inner table in to a view and create an additional entity class orli lib run the inner table first and put the resultset in a codeincode clauseli ul  pI went with option b. Here is the Java code that I originally hadp  precoderesult  getCriteria.setResultTransformerCriteria.ROOTENTITY.setFirstResultindex.setMaxResultsROWBUFSIZE.list codepre  pwherep  ul licodegetCriteriacode returns a codeorg.hibernate.Criteriacode object pointing at the root entity which includes the codejoincode, codewherecode and codeorder bycode clausesli licodeindexcode is the first digit of the codelimitcode clauseli licodeROWBUFSIZEcode is the second digit of the codelimitcode clause hardcoded to 100li ul  pI changed it to bep  precode    Criteria crit  getCriteria.setResultTransformerCriteria.ROOTENTITY.setFirstResultindex.setMaxResultsROWBUFSIZE     Listltgt ids  crit.setProjectionProperty.forNameid.list     crit.setProjectionnull.setResultTransformerCriteria.ROOTENTITY     ifids.isEmpty crit.addRestrictions.inid, ids.setFirstResult0     result  crit.list codepre  pSo lines 1 and 2 produce the inner query and get the resultset. I reuse the same codecritcode object  so line 3 just reverts the projection created on line 2. Line 4 will add the new codeincode clause but not if the resultset is empty  as this results in a MySQL exception. Line 5 now gets the same resultset the previous code was getting  but it just gets it a emlotem faster in 2 seconds vs. the previous 20 min 47.32 sec in my case.p

Negative 34297 pIs it safe to set up Store listeners in codecomponentDidMountcode without at the same time also calling codesetStatecode or codeforceUpdatecode and thus triggering an immediate rerenderp  pIn React the common examples seem to be to synchronise Store state in codegetInitialStatecode or pull Store data in the coderendercode before listening, and then start listening in codecomponentDidMountcode.  What prevents a Store change being missed in the interval between the render and setting up the listener in codecomponentDidMountcodep  pIf a child component takes a synchronous action in its codecomponentDidMountcode that changes the store wont this change be missed by the parent component  p  pIf the child component emits an asynchronous action in codecomponentDidMountcode is there any chance this could change the Store in a way that is missed by the parent componentp  pAre there any gaps in the React component lifecycle where asynchronous events can get inp  pComing from a background in preemptive asynchronous programming the lack of explicit synchronisation guards in javascript, while often unnecessary in cooperative asynchronous programming, really make me uneasy.p

Negative 34297 pI have an issue with a single at least for now iPhone not being able to connect to websockets. Unfortunately I dont have access to the device and I cant run more tests on it at the moment, so no proper network dumps or anything else deeper level debugging available. Cant test on other network connections either at the moment.p  pEverything works perfectly with Chrome 45, Firefox 40, Chrome 45 on Android many devices, Safari on iOS9 device A, Safari on iOS8 device B etc. No errors, no cutoffs, nothing. Just works.p  pMy websocket server runs on IIS 8.5  ASP.NET, created as an API controller with the typical way PullHandler is an async Task codewhilecodeing until connection closesp  precodeif HttpContext.Current.IsWebSocketRequest      HttpContext.Current.AcceptWebSocketRequestPullHandler     return Request.CreateResponseHttpStatusCode.SwitchingProtocols  else     return Request.CreateErrorResponseHttpStatusCode.BadRequest, Bad request codepre  pThis should not cause any issues, especially this one. The client side JavaScript is also the simplep  precodenew WebSocketws  window.location.host  apiSomeEndpoint codepre  pI am using plain HTTP, no SSLTLS.p  pWhen trying on iPhone device X with iOS9 13A344, not entirely sure of which model it just cant get the connection. I am also using SignalR which automatically goes into emlongPollingem transport on this device. With others its nicely on emwebSocketsem transport.p  pQuick testing on UK Orange 3G connection showed on my HTTP logs that for some reason the request for my endpoint has gone to the else branch, like something had stripped the upgrade headers away.p  blockquote   pGET apiSomeEndpoint 80  Mozilla5.0iPhoneCPUiPhoneOS90likeMacOSXAppleWebKit601.1.46KHTML,likeGeckoVersion9.0Mobile13A344Safari601.1  400p blockquote  pStatus 400 is clearly showing the bad request that my code is sending if the request is not a proper websocket request. I dont know if there could be some transparent proxy, that could explain this. The 400 response was received without any delays.p  pBut this was a problem also through wifi on the same device. Again, a laptop with OS X and Safari had no issues on the same wifi to connect to SignalR and my websocket server. Only the iPhone had issues. On wifi I didnt get any attempts to connect on the logs and SignalR also immediately went into longPolling transport. The wifi apparently used Virgin Medias network based on IP address.p  pOn wifi there is first an open event. Then after some time there is a close event with status 1006, which is abnormal termination without a close packet. My code tries to connect again and the same happens. Strangely there is no log entry at the web server, but it might just be Safaris way to post the open event even though an actual connection was not established and after a timeout it sends the close event.p  pThe device should not have any proxies set up and other browsing works without issues.

Negative 34297 pI have ws working for sending user login details through a websocket. However I know that someone sniffing packets could capture the password, so I wanted to use wss instead. However I now understand, through playing around with my back end, that firstly a certificate is required for it to connect properly, and secondly, if i cause the self signed certificate warning to sho0w, afterwards the websockets will work with wss, but that is not good enoyugh for clients. From googling this issue, I have found that A self signed certificate will probalby not be good enough.p  pAnd all I want is to provide a user with a safe way to login..... So anyway I am now thinking it would be better to avoid having to use wss all together. I could use a conventional servlet for login but that will probably require a certificate too for https and I dont want to have to start paying people loads of money for certificates when my business might not even be that successful.p  pI have been thinking about other ways I could send the users password securely. One way might be to generate a hash in the browser. I know I could use some king of challenge along with a salt sent to the browser but I am not exactly sure how to do this and how safe this would be. I have the conventional login working with a salt, generating a hash with AES. Any suggestionsp  pI just want the users login details to be safe and I dont want to go down the route of certificates, its annoying and unreliable. p
