Positive 1508 pThe following is a json array as displayed on a website I am using.  As you can see it is information pertaining to stops for a garbage truck route.  I know I can filter individual stops based on the stops Id.  For instance I can append the following to the codeurl filter[id]3code and this will give me only this stop.p  pDoes anyone know how to filter based on the relationship assignment p  pstrongIn other words, how do I filter all the stops that have an assignment of 1strong  p  pI have checked jsonapi.org and the examples there only deal with the attributes of the base data as I have shown.

Positive 1508 pSo Im hooking into an application api that returns a flat array of values  the order of the values defines the specific structure of data, and Id like to be able to transform this array into an object that reflects this underlying structure.p  pWorking backward, this is what Id like to end up withp  precodeappnameappX,  affectednodes  [                        nodenamenodeX,nodeidxxx,                        nodenamenodeY,nodeidyyy                     ]  codepre  pBut this is what Im givenp  precode[appX,2,nodeX,xxx,nodeY,yyy] codepre  pThe actual data is much more complex, with multiple tiers of attribute arrays nested within each other. As you can see, Im given the length of each nested attribute in the original flat array, represented in my example as code2code. Ive started wrangling with transforming the flat array into a proper object structure and the whole business seems very inefficient and difficult to maintain. My approach currently looks something like thisp  precodevar arr  [appX,2,nodeX,xxx,nodeY,yyy] var obj    obj.appname  arr[0]  var numnodes  arr[1]  obj.affectednodes  []  var position  1  forvar i  0 i lt numnodes i     var subobj       subobj.nodename  arr[position  1]     subobj.nodeid  arr[position  2]     obj.affectednodes.pushsubobj     position  position  2  codepre  pThis is working, but I feel like there may be a more efficient solution out there that hasnt occurred to me. Is there a better algorithm or perhaps library function to accomplish this sort of taskp

Positive 1508 pI have created and Instagram clone and I am having some trouble with appending comments to individual codeltdivgtcode elements. What I would like to accomplish is to have a user type some text in the codeltinputgtcode box, click the submit button, and have said text appear under the codeltinputgtcode area via a codeltligtcode in a codeltulgtcode I created called codecommentlistcode. Similarly, I would only like said input to be targeted to each specific image imported from my JSON GET request without text duplication on any single item. The jQuery seems right to be able to append the text, but it isnt working and a fresh pair of eyes certainly wouldnt hurt.p  pHere is the jsbin a hrefhttpjsbin.comtecahaeditoutput

There are likely many other employee endpoints besides roles.p  pUsing Jersey I split this up into a root resource with several subresources, for examplep  precodePathemployees public class EmployeesResource      ...     GET     PathemployeeIdroles     public RolesResource getRolesPathParamemployeeId long employeeId          return new RolesResourceemployeeId       codepre  pThis produces the desired JSON result when I GET codeemployeescode and codeemployees1code but when I GET codeemployees1rolescode I get the response bodyp  precode     roles [                      id 20,             responsibility 1000         ,         ...     ]  codepre  pJersey has wrapped my collection of Role representations in some object. Note The object seems to be connected to the name of the subresource resource method within RolesResource for example, if the method is named codegetRolescode I get coderoles [...]code, if the method is named codegetFoocode I get codefoo [...]code.p  pstrongMy Questionstrong There must be a reason Jersey does this. Why would I want my representation to be wrapped like this And if there isnt a good reason, how can I get rid of thisp  pEdit Im using Dropwizard version 0.8.2, which it looks like a hrefhttpmvnrepository.comartifactio.dropwizarddropwizardjersey0.8.2 relnofollowfrom mavena is pulling in Jersey 2.19. It uses Jackson as the JSON provider  again, from maven it looks like the version is 2.5.1. No web.xml as this is a dropwizard application.p

Positive 1508 pI am stuck in a scenario wondering about the best practice that can be applied for that. I am working on an Ecommerce website dealing in orders, shipments, invoices etc. p  pApart from UI creation in my application i also have the ability to sendreceive data from different suppliersthrough supplier apis xmljson. The application can post ordersshipments to a supplier created in my application or get all ordersshipments from a supplier to import in my app. The scenario varies from supplier to supplier.p  pMy question is what would be the best approach to handle this. Below are the two approaches i have thought of. I am using the first approach right now but i am thinking whether its the right one to be used in this case.p  pstrong1. I have created a generic code to generate JSONXML based on XPATH. For example for below XML generation i use the XPATH as Orders.order.orderNumber codeltOrdersgtltordergtltorderNumbergttestorderltorderNumbergtltordergtltOrdersgtcode The XPATH is stored in database and based on the different configured XPATH in database, complete JSONXML is generated and sent to the supplierGETPOST is also configured in database.strongp  pThe advantage i think of this approach is minimal work to add new suppliers into the system. The disadvantage i think it has is the XMLJSON generation which goes through big loops. As the APIs to be called for suppliersOrders GET etc are mostly fixed, this appears to be a disdvantage.p  pstrong2. I create separate services to handle each supplier calls, create methods that handle each call with XML hardcoded into the applicationWithout configuration in DB through XPATH. For ex, for 2 suppliers SuppA and SuppB. For SuppA orders list is to be downloaded and for SuppB shipments are to be posted. So there will be 2 services in my application handling each supplier calls independent of one another, 1 for SuppA and another for SuppB. SuppA service will call the orders GET api and SuppB service will call Shipments POST api.strong p  pThe advantage of this i think is that it would be fast as XMLJSON generation would not be needed as only the required calls will be coded in the service codes for each supplier. The disadvantage i think it has is that only fixed services can be called. I the first approach anything could be changed through DB, but in this code needs to be changed.p  pPlease suggest on this. Which approach is best for this scenario, the Generic DB configuration or the hardcoded separate supplier servicesp

Positive 1508 pIve built a Python Flask App API that responds with JSON. I want the response to now include both JSON and an image.p  pHow can I create as a single HTTP response that passes both JSON data and an imagep  pFor the JSON, Im using return codejsonifysome dictcode.p  pAnd for the image, Ive read to make the image a StringIO object and then on it to use code.getvaluecode and pass codeStringIO.getvaluecode as an argument to coderesponsecode and return that. The image is produced by matplotlib see a hrefhttpsgist.github.comwilsaj862153 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comwilsaj862153ap  pWhile http responses cant send more than one content type, the means for passing the image would seem to imply that its simply text. Is that true If so, can the image simply be wrapped in the JSON also, as a separate key from the other JSON data being passedp  pThese posts would seem to suggest yes, that images can be transferred via JSON with a Byte array. p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8726400howcaniaddanimagefileintojsonobjectHow can I add an image file into json objecta p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1443158binarydatainjsonstringsomethingbetterthanbase64Binary Data in JSON String.

Negative 1508 pI have a set of staticallycompiled libraries, with fairly deeprunning dependencies between the libraries. For example, the executable X uses libraries A and B, A uses library C, and B uses libraries C and Dp  precodeX gt A      A gt C X gt B      B gt C      B gt D codepre  pWhen I link X with A and B, I dont want to get errors if C and D were not also added to the list of librariesmdashthe fact that A and B use these libraries internally is an implementation detail that X should not need to know about. Also, when new dependencies are added anywhere in the dependency tree, the project file of any program that uses A or B would have to be reconfigured. For a deep dependency tree, the list of required libraries can become really long and hard to maintain.p  pSo, I am using the Additional Dependencies setting of the Librarian section in the A project, adding C.lib. And in the same section of Bs project, I add C.lib and D.lib. The effect of this is that the librarian bundles C.lib into A.lib, and C.lib and D.lib into B.lib.p  pWhen I link X, however, both A.lib and B.lib contain their own copy of C.lib. This leads to tons of warnings along the lines ofp  blockquote   pA.libc.obj  warning LNK4006 symbol symbol already defined in B.libc.obj second definition ignored.p blockquote  pHow can I accomplish this without getting warnings Is there a way to simply disable the warning, or is there a better wayp  pstrongEDITstrong I have seen more than one answer suggesting that, for the lack of a better alternative, I simply disable the warning.

Negative 1508 pOK first of all let me say im not much of a design guy. Most of the work i do is usually on the backendinfrastructure WCF,DB,Buisness Objects. We dont have a formal web designer unless you consider someone with a communication major who uses frontpage type programs to design web pages a web designer. I know basic HTML of course but i have not kept up with the latest design technologystandards in HTML XHTML, CSS Design, ect...p  pToday i was given the task of some pretty major design changes of some of our webforms. The pages were a total mess Most of the alignment was done using nested tables. I got everything to look right and it looked fine in IE7. Our site says we support both firefox amp ie. So i go and try to and load it in firefox latest version and boy did it look messed up. At first i thought....well the browsercaps must not be installed in the machine.config on my machine which is a mess in itself the way its maintained . So i go to codeproject, which unfortunately where i think its maintained, and get the latest version which i think is from 2006 and it makes no difference. So then i go try a slew of different browsers Opera, Chrome, and Safari. It looks slightly different on them but well within acceptable limits. Firefox is really the only browser that looks messed up. So after trying and trying all kind of different layout options which many worked for all browser but not firefox i was getting very frustrated and about to pull out the little hair i had. p  pAfter going through all of this.....im thinking THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY How can you use tables for precise layout There are to many differences in browser rendering especially when your layout requirements are very precise for example there was code where they were attempting to draw draw a line under a custom header by using the bottom border on each TD in the header section which is one of a few areas firefox was screwing up. I know the layout can be accomplished with CSS eventhough ive never did it. Please tell me its a lot more browser independent or at least give me some pointers so i know the code we are wrighting will be browser complaint....which i dont know how hard it is since how many browsers are 100 ACID complaintp  pAny pointerssuggestions would be appreciated.p  pthanks, Ncagep  pEdit Thanks guys for all your help....i really appreciate it.

Negative 1508 pThis is a bit of an odd situation. Heres whats happening.p  pSo, we have a VS2008 project which outputs to a number of files under perforce control. These files have the always writable flag set.p  pI compile the project in VS, which gives me up to date binaries on my machine. If I then revert those binaries via perforce, I have the version of the binaries that were up on perforce ie, old ones. p  pDespite this, compiling the project again at this point detects no changes and will not remake those binaries. In a way, this makes sense, since none of the code or obj files have changed, but its not really what I want to happen.p  pThis comes up in an edge case on our automated build server. I can think of tons of different little hacks I could do to fix this, but Im thinking I could be missing something fundamental here.p  pThe actual build process uses the Unreal build tool, so there is a bit of magic going on behind the scenes that Im not entirely familiar with too.p  pstrongEditstrong This is a CC project, forgot to mention that.p

We cant put the whole world on Strings shoulders.p  pDo I look at tasking my UI to provide business values, using a ruleset pushed out from the server app, or open my business objects up a bit to do the required sanitising etc. as they required  Neither of these approaches sits quite right with me the first seems closer to ideal, but quite a bit of work, while the latter doesnt show much respect to the business objects single responsibility.

Negative 1508 pI have an application using Fluent NHibernate on the server side to configure the database. Fluent uses Lazyloading as default, but I explicitly disabled this as this gave me problems when sending the objects to the client side. Obviously the client cant load the objects lazily as it doesnt have access to the database. p  pNow I try reenabling Lazyloading for parts of my datamodel as there are some parts where I only want to return toplevel objects to the client. However, they dont seem to be Lazyloaded. Why p  pWhat I did to disable LazyLoading was adding codeNot.LazyLoadingcode in the mapping object, and on references in the mapping. Now removing this doesnt seem to have effect. Debugging I see all the referenced objects, and I also get them all on the client side. However, the codeNHibernateUtil.IsInitializedmyObjectFromDb.SomeReferencecode correctly says false at the same time. So how do I ensure that the objects are lazyloaded getting a object missing its references back to the client Any ideas what I might got wrong p  pI have a few classes very simplified example.. p  precodepublic class Customer      public virtual int Id  get set      public virtual string Name  get set      public virtual IListltOrdergt Orders  get set    public class Order      public virtual int Id  get set      public virtual IListltItemgt Items  get set    public class Item      public virtual int Id  get set      public virtual string Name  get set   codepre  pSimple mappings  using default LazyLoading p  precodepublic class CustomerMapping  ClassMapltCustomergt      public CustomerMapping              Idc gt c.Id         Mapc gt c.Name         HasManyc gt c.Orders        public class OrderMapping  ClassMapltOrdergt      public OrderMapping              Idc gt c.Id         HasManyc gt c.Items        public class ItemMapping  ClassMapltItemgt      public ItemMapping              Idc gt c.Id         Mapc gt c.Name       codepre  pAnd I fetch it straight forward with a codeSession.LoadltCustomergtidcode  returning the result over my REST service directly without accessing the object such that the lazy references are loaded.

Negative 1508 pI have a video Im playing on iOS 4.2 where Im listening in the timeupdate events and pausing video at certain times. This is fairly accurate. However, I also have player controls that seek to certain parts of the video using current time. p  pThere appears to be a bug where the time seeked is never accurate  not accurate enough for what I need to do with it. The problem gets worse as the length of the video increases and Ive also noticed that at the beginning of the video the seek time would be around 0.5 miliseconds off the time I specify but as I try to seek further along in the video this increases.

Negative 1508 pI have started using the codedoMCcode package for R as the parallel backend for parallelised codeplyrcode routines.p  pThe parallelisation itself seems to be working fine though I have yet to properly benchmark the speedup, my problem is that the logging is now asynchronous and messages from different cores are getting mixed in together. I could created different logfiles for each core, but I think I neater solution is to simply add a different label for each core. I am currently using the codelog4rcode package for my logging needs.p  pI remember when using MPI that each processor got a rank, which was a way of distinguishing each process from one another, so is there a way to do this with codedoMCcode I did have the idea of extracting the PID, but this does seem messy and will change for every iteration.p  pI am open to ideas though, so any suggestions are welcome.p  pstrongEDIT 20110408strong Going with the suggestion of one answer, I still have the issue of correctly identifying which subprocess I am currently inside, as I would either need separate closures for each codelogcode call so that it writes to the correct file, or I would have a single codelogcode function, but have some logic inside it determining which logfile to append to. In either case, I would still need some way of labelling the current subprocess, but I am not sure how to do this.p  pIs there an equivalent of the codempirankcode function in the MPI libraryp

Negative 1508 pI am trying to build an ASP.NET site that allows each user to set their own session timeout value.  Basically from the users perspective if they set their timeout value to 30 then that means that after 30 minutes of inactivity they are required to reauthenticate.

Negative 1508 pI am trying to implement the accepted answer from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3627029smartwaytogenerateuniquerandomnumberthis questiona for ID generation and using XML files for storage of my content and for the content IDs table.p  pThe idea is each content item would be stored serialized as mycontentitemslug374871.xml, where the number is the random ID that the content item will be given from the IDs table from the ones that are not yet taken. My requirement is that the ID is a six digit number display requirements between 100000 and 999999, so effectively we will only be able to create 899999 content items but that should be enough. If you wonder why such a requirement, I can only say that I dont want IDs starting from zero and I dont want IDs such as GUIDs which would be way easier to create and maintain, I know because ID will be used in MVC routes much like the SOs URLs.p  pSo for starters I decided to create a Dictionary, where key is the ID and value determines whether it is used or not true if used, false if available. I then serialize this object into XML file using DataContractSerializer.p  pThe file is 72MB long and here I think the problems start to appear. First of all, I just tried to open this file in VS2010, Notepad, Wordpad and IE and they all crashed and memory consumption went skyrocket. But the application seems to have no problems with it. Still I think this will be huge memory and CPU hog and performance will suffer. p  pAm I right in my assumptiosn and if so, what are my other optionsp

Negative 1508 pWhen you access elements of an array using array[i], I thought that C would take the starting position of the array in memory and add isizeofone array element and then dereference that address or do something equivalent to what I just described.

If you had strings stored in contiguous memory and then appended more characters to one of them, all of the succeeding strings would have to be moved over.p  pCan someone explain to me how this worksp

Negative 1508 pI was wondering if its possible it should be to query multiple tables simultaneously several at once in SQLite. Basically I have several tables that have the exact same columns, but the data in them is just organized by the table its in. I need to be able to use codeSELECTcode to get data from the tables I heard codeUNIONcode could help, which matches a condition, then group the data by the table its in.p  pIn other words, would something like this be possiblep  precodeSELECT  FROM table1,table2,table3,table4,table5,table6 WHERE day15 GROUP BY table codepre  pId rather not resort to having to query the tables individually as then I would have a bunch of codeCursorscode that Id have to manually go through and that would be difficult when I only have one codeSimpleCursorAdaptercode Unless a codeSimpleCursorAdaptercode can have several codeCursorcodesp  pThanks.p  pstrongEDITstrong The structure of my tablesp  precodeMain Table  contains references to subtables in a column tbls              and metainformation about the data stored in the subtables      Subtable  contains reference to subsubtables in a column tbls                and metainformation about the data stored in the                subsubtables          Subsubtable  contains the actual entries codepre  pBasically these tables just make it easier to organize the hierarchical data structure. I suppose instead of having the subsubtables, I could keep the codeactual entriescode in the subtable but add a prefix, and have a separate table for the metainformation. It just seems it would be harder to deleteupdate the structure if I need to remove a level in this data set.p

Negative 1508 pIm trying to find a less clunky solution to a Java concurrency problem.p  pThe gist of the problem is that I need a shutdown call to block while there are still worker threads active, but the crucial aspect is that the worker tasks are each spawned and completed asynchronously so the hold and release must be done by different threads. I need them to somehow send a signal to the shutdown thread once their work has completed. Just to make things more interesting, the worker threads cannot block each other so Im unsure about the application of a Semaphore in this particular instance.p  pI have a solution which I think safely does the job, but my unfamiliarity with the Java concurrency utils leads me to think that there might be a much easier or more elegant pattern. Any help in this regard would be greatly appreciated.p  pHeres what I have so far, fairly sparse except for the commentsp  precodefinal private ReentrantReadWriteLock shutdownLock  new ReentrantReadWriteLock volatile private int activeWorkerThreads private boolean isShutdown  private void workerTask     try            Point A Worker tasks mustnt block each other.       shutdownLock.readLock.lock         Point B I only want worker tasks to continue if the shutdown signal        hasnt already been received.       if isShutdown          return        activeWorkerThreads          Point C This async method call returns immediately, soon after which        we release our lock. The shutdown thread may then acquire the write lock        but we want it to continue blocking until all of the asynchronous tasks        have completed.       executeAsynchronouslynew Runnable                 Override          final public void run                       try                             Do stuff.                          finally                              Point D Release of shutdown thread loop, if there are no other                 active worker tasks.                activeWorkerThreads                                       finally           shutdownLock.readLock.unlock        final public void shutdown     try            Point E Shutdown thread must block while any worker threads        have breached Point A.       shutdownLock.writeLock.lock        isShutdown  true         Point F Is there a better way to wait for this signal       while activeWorkerThreads gt 0                   Do shutdown operation.        finally           shutdownLock.writeLock.unlock      codepre  pThanks in advance for any helpp  pRussp

Negative 1508 pIm looking if someone has done this already. What I want basically is to make a browser out of CURL. By default, when CURL Data is fetched and outputted  it displays nicely, until you click on a link or fill a form from browser, not php. Is it possible to make CURL Emulate a browser  So the end result would be CURL opening a Login URL and displaying it and then when Login form is submitted from browser, it automatically logs in via CURL, when a link in admin panel is clicked from browser it it parsed with CURL and the correct URL is again crawled with CURL p  pOr can maybe someone give me a heads up how services like hidemyass.com are working  not looking to create a proxy server or something like thatp

Negative 1508 pI need advice on how to go about a problem I have with sorting a DataView in C.p  pI need to add a sort property to my DataView because I later need it when I call a Find on the DataView which needs to have a sort property specified in order to work. I need the Find in order to properly map a DataRow to a DataGridViewRow. I currently just use the row index to map to the DataGridViewRow, but this wont work in all cases if the user physically moves rows, or changes the sort order in the DataGridView UI because then the ids no longer matchupmap.p  pWhen I create the DataView, I load in a DataTable to pass in for creation. This DataTable can be of any form, I do not know what the DataTable contains for columns and rows. Therefore, I cannot create a sort if I dont know any column names to sort by.p  pI was thinking of just taking the first column name column[0]  no matter what it is and using that to sort. But this seems kinda sketchy, nop  pMy question is, is there a better way to determine what to sort my DataView by when column names are unknown p  pThanksp

Negative 1508 pI have one iphone  application in which recurring events happens.the duration are like every day,every 2nd day,every 3rd day..,every week on mon,every week on tues,...,every second week on mon,..,every month on 1sr,every month on 2nd...,every second month on 1st,every second month on 2nd,...  For some events there is end date but some events occurs forever.so how can i insert them automatically in sqlite3 database.eg.If an event repeats every 3rd day.how can i store it automatically after 3 days.or should i store all the events at the time of creation.If i store all the evnets at time of creation then the events that repeats forever.upto what duration i should store the value of them in database.p  pFor this i have thought 2 approaches.one is storing just one occurance with repeated duration like every day.but in my application edit and delete functionality is also there.suppose event has one field event description then it can be different for different dates if user edit the events.events are displayed datewise on screen for a particular month and user can navigate to any previous and next month for current ,next and previous years.So if i use only single occurance then where should those edited or deleted events should be stored.  And if i take second approach store each occurance in database.Then upto what duration i should store the events which has no enddate.or is there a way that insert is automatically performed after specified duration.p
Negative 1508 pWe allow users to set some preferences in our web application.  When they login to certain sites, they are allowed to dosee different screens vs. when they are in another site.  One of our requirements is that we hide preferences on the page which they cant access in the currently logged in site.  Currently we are using Spring MVC to handle these requests.  p  pHere is a simplified example of our POJOp  precodepublic class Preferences    boolean prefA Valid when can do A   String prefB  Valid when can do B   Integer prefC Valid when can do C   ....   Long prefZ    Valid when can do Z  codepre  pHere is the controller codep  precodeRequestMappingmethod  RequestMethod.POST, value  preferences.xhtml public ModelAndView updateRequestPreferencesModelAttributeUSERPREFERENCES final Preference preferences, final BindingResult results    return updatePreferencespreferences, results  codepre  pCurrently updatePreferences does reflection, and ensures that the value is not null before it persists the input preferences  This is due to Spring MVC creating a new instance of Preferences and then populating the values with what was on the UI.p  pWe could do the following in the setter of the preferencesp  precodepublic void setPreferencesPreferences preferences    if preferences.getPrefA  null      this.preferences.setPrefApreferences.getPrefA      if preferences.getPrefB  null      this.preferences.setPrefBpreferences.getPrefB       ...   if preferences.getPrefZ  null      this.preferences.setPrefZpreferences.getPrefZ     codepre  pIt would get unwieldy even with a helper function for all the checks in the setter method and seems like an easy step to forget when a new preference is created at the same time reflection seems like a cop out.  Is there a better way to refactor thisp

The 3rd frame is supposed to take the token from the 2nd jsp which is passed to the 3rd jsp which returns an XML file of the users access. How would I get the Submit button to open both of these frames or should I have two separate buttonsp

Negative 1508 pFrom working on this specific situation, it was news to me that the logic operators are not short circuited in SQL.p  pI routinely do something along these lines in the where clause usually when dealing with search queriesp  precodeWHERE    Description IS NULL OR Description  myTable.Description codepre  pWhich, even if its not shortcircuited in this example, doesnt really matter.  However, when dealing with the fulltext search functions, it does matter.. If the second part of that query was codeCONTAINSmyTable.Description, Descriptioncode, it wouldnt work because the variable is not allowed to be null or empty for these functions.p  pI found out the codeWHENcode statements of codeCASEcode are executed in order, so I can change my query like so to ensure the fulltext lookup is only called when needed, along with changing the variable from null to codecode when it is null to allow the query to executep  precodeWHERE    CASE WHEN Description   THEN 1 WHEN CONTAINSmyTable.Description, Description THEN 1 ELSE 0 END  1 codepre  pThe above code should prevent the fulltext query piece from executing unless there is actually a value to search with.p  pMy question is, if I run this query where Description is codecode, there is still quite a bit of time in the execution plan spent dealing with clustered index seeks and fulltextmatch, even though that table and search does not end up being used at all is there any way to avoid thisp  pIm trying to get this out of a hardcoded dynamic query and into a stored procedure, but if the procedure ends up being slower, Im not sure I can justify it.p

Negative 1508 pAs I understand, before the Mango SDK update 7.1, you were only able to access a rather broad network type via the property codeNetworkInterface.NetworkInterfaceTypecode. This would return an enumeration like codeWireless80211code, codeMobileBroadbandGSMcode, or codeMobileBroadbandCDMAcode.p  pAfter the release of the Mango SDK, we are now able to access the NetworkInterfaceSubtype via an open socket using a call similar to this codesocket.GetCurrentNetworkInterfacecode A property of the returned object codeNetworkInterfaceInfo.InterfaceSubtypecode will give you more specific network information such as codeCellularEDGEcode, codeCellularHSPAcode, or codeCellularEVDVcode. This is the information I need.p  pThe most efficient way I have found to access this is to open an async host name resolution request and grab the information in the async callback function, such as below borrowed from this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5325627howcanicheckfor3gwifiedgecellularnetworksinwindowsphone7How can I check for 3G, wifi, EDGE, Cellular Networks in Windows Phone 7ap  precodeDeviceNetworkInformation.ResolveHostNameAsync         new DnsEndPointmicrosoft.com, 80,          new NameResolutionCallbacknrr gt                              var info  nrr.NetworkInterface                 var subType  info.InterfaceSubtype             , null codepre  pWhat Im looking for is a way to access this NetworkSubtype information without having to actually open a data connection. The reason I need a passive method for querying this information is that I need to know when the network type changes, but continually opening a data connection in a loop that queries this could potentially prevent that change from taking place.p  pUPDATE 1 I have found through testing that, as Richard Szalay suggested, the codeDeviceNetworkInformation.NetworkAvailabilityChangedcode event does indeed fire when the handset switches network technologies i.e. 3G to EDGE, or WiFi to HSPA, and you do have access to the codeNetworkInterfaceSubtypecode. I unfortunately have also found that when switching from WiFi to a cellular network technology e.g. HSPA, EDGE that the reported network subtype can often be inaccurate. For instance, if you switch from WiFi to HSPA, the event arguments may still report a connection to WiFi when it gets fired, and no second event is fired to report HSPA. You are thus given the wrong connection type. This unreliability may make using this trigger ultimately useless, but I am going to do some network testing without WiFi to see if this issue is confined to WiFi switching. Im hoping that its just an issue with the WiFi radio, and that cellular network switching is reported accurately. Ill update this when I know more.p  pUPDATE 2 I have found through a lot of driving around testing that while the codeDeviceNetworkInformation.NetworkAvailabilityChangedcode event will get you the network changes, it does not seem possible to determine exactly what raisestriggers the event. For instance, if youre recording the network interface each time the event is triggered, you could end up with results like HSPA, EDGE, EDGE, EDGE, GPRS, GPRS, HSPA. The event argument object has a variable named codeNotificationTypecode that is supposed to tell you the reason it was triggered, but this is always set to codeCharacteristicUpdatecode in my tests, so I have no idea why it is being triggered multiple times for the same network type e.g. EDGE, EDGE, EDGE. For my purposes, I am just recording the changes that have not already been recorded and ignoring the multiples. It is not ideal and seems slightly less than trustworthy, but its better than nothing, I suppose.p

Negative 1508 pI have just using WatiN.  My company uses the jQuery show and hide functions to display error messages.  I want to make sure that these messages appear at the correct times. I have been using a test script from a jQuery download which uses show and hide. I added id values to the div tag and to one of the enclosed scan tags. I have been unable to detect in my code when the message is being displayed.  p  pI have included below both both the jQuery script and my code.  The script has two buttons, one for displaying and one for hiding a message.  My code hits the hide button and examines the visibility and width attributes and then hits the show button and looks at the same attributes.  I can see on the screen that the text is indeed being hidden and then shown. When I set break points, in both cases the visibility is set to inherited and the width is set to auto.  What can I do to distinguish between the two casesp  precodejQuery code ltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt       ltstylegt       span  backgroundD8BFD8 padding3px floatleft        ltstylegt       ltscript srcjquery1.7.1.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt     ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltbutton idhidbgtHideltbuttongt   ltbutton idshowbgtShowltbuttongt   ltdiv iddynamicOutputgt      ltspan idjquerygtjQueryltspangt ltspangtisltspangt ltspangteasyltspangt      ltspangttoltspangt ltspangtuseltspangt ltspangtandltspangt      ltspangtgivesltspangt ltspangtdynamic output..ltspangt    ltdivgt  ltscriptgt     hidb.clickfunction                 spanlastchild.hidefast, function        use callee so dont have to name the function         this.prev.hidefast, arguments.callee              showb.clickfunction     span.show2000   ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt  Test code   [TestMethod]         [STAThread]         public void lookAtElements                         var browser  new IEhttplocalhosttestjqHIdeShowText.html                 Element el2  browser.SpanFind.ByIdjquery                  Element el  browser.DivFind.ByIddynamicOutput                 string att                string att2                string width                string width2                string msg                string msg2                  Button btn  browser.ButtonFind.ByIdhidb                btn.Click                  width  el.Style.GetAttributeValuewidth                width2  el2.Style.GetAttributeValuewidth                 System.Threading.Thread.Sleep5000                 el.Parent.Refresh                el.Refresh                el2.Refresh                 width  el.Style.GetAttributeValuewidth                width2  el2.Style.GetAttributeValuewidth                att  el.Style.GetAttributeValuevisibility                att2  el2.Style.GetAttributeValuevisibility               msg  el.Text                msg2  el2.Text                  btn  browser.ButtonFind.ByIdshowb                btn.Click                System.Threading.Thread.Sleep5000             el.Parent.Refresh            el.Refresh            el2.Refresh                 att  el.Style.GetAttributeValuevisibility                att2  el2.Style.GetAttributeValuevisibility                width  el.Style.GetAttributeValuewidth                width2  el2.Style.GetAttributeValuewidth                msg  el.Text                msg2  el2.Text                browser.Close                codepre

It is a separate window, but is shown modal and has the codeTMasterMainFormcode as its explicit popup parent.p  pNow when the codeTSlaveFormcode is closed the Slave application calls codeSetForegroundWindowcode on the handle of the codeTMasterMainFormcode, but this is not correct anymore since there is a modal form codeTMasterModalFormcode on top of it.p  pSo the question isp  pHow do I manage setting the foreground window in this non trivial situationp  pPS This is a simplified description, the real application is also doing this foreground window stuff the other way around.p

Its also not an option to send the font to the users, since there are  20.000 new ones each year.p  pIs there another solution to cut the file size or use compression. Perhaps in Word, PHP, FTP, Apachep
Negative 1508 pI am writing a an Android app which is essentially an network based tic tac toe, There is a server on the computer an two Android phones as clients playing against each other. To accomplish this task I created a multithreaded server that can deal with both clients, and I created the two clients and I made them receive what the server sends them in a separate thread and using a handler I change the UI once the server sends the other players move.p  pThe problem is that the serverThread never recognizes what any of the clients send. The protocol I am using between the client and the server is a number based protocol, once the client clicks on a tile, a number is sent to the server, the server adds this number to an array, and sends it to all the threadsBoth clients so that they can change this tile from tile to X or O depending on the numberp  ol lipHere is the code for the listener of two buttons, all other buttons are

Negative 1508 pSince the equals function in array only check the instance, it doesnt work well with Set. Hence, I wonder how to make a set of arrays in javap  pOne possible way could be put each array in an object, and implement equals function for that class, but will that decrease the performance too muchp
Negative 1508 pBasically my question is i have a website which was developed around 3 years ago, while development it was proposed that this site will be used by few people on internet.p  pBut now it seems like many users are accessing the website. So we have planned to create a Web sever Farm where we have multiple servers for our website. p  pmajor problem in development is old website used codeInProccode Session state and now since we are upgrading to multiple servers we want to change codeInProccode to codeOutproccode i.e StateServer Session State. p  pCan you guide me on this upgrade and how can it be achieved in simple and easy way rather than changing the coding on each pages wherever sessions are used.p

Negative 1508 pI currently attend CalArts as a Music Technology major. Ive currently thought up an idea that Id like to take a stab at, though its become a bit more complex as Ive gotten into it.  I know there are easier ways to do this, but I want to do this to say I could. The idea is that I might use a premade node chat server or maybe write one myself, and link it into ChucK a programming language developed at princeton. The idea is that when buttons are pressed or return is hit, itll send a signal to ChucK and tell it to play a sound via the Sndbuf function. p  pMy issue is that ChucK is based on CC and Node is Javascript based. Im not sure how I could get the two languages to communicate. I know ChucK has the ability to listen on ports for web server requests but Im not a TCPIP expert. p  pIm aware some of this might not exist and that I might need to write a lot of it on my own. It being anything from a framework to a server. Any advise on how to make them communicate with each other would be much appreciated.p

Basically, it is to make the field use the first suggestion from the autocomplete list when the user presses enter. The answer for that question has a jsfiddle  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdodgerpbbhHhttpjsfiddle.netdodgerpbbhHa  which works except when the text field loses focus, the field value returns to the partially entered value. p  pFor example, a user clicks in the input field and types ox, the autocomplete box pops up with some suggestions, and the user presses enter. The map is then changed to show the location of the first item from the autocomplete box with a marker, and the value of the input field is changed to the first item from the autocomplete box.

Negative 1508 pthis is my first ever post to Stack Overflow and its because Ive been tearing my hair out over this issue for the past day.p  pIm pretty new to jQuery and have a basic understanding of how things work but Im really struggling with getting a function to loop back on itself after it has processed. Its a simple ifelse function that runs through a series of five images to see if they are visible or not. p  pIf an image is visible in other words, the current image in a gallery then the next and previous buttons will control which image is next to be faded in and subsequently fade out the previous image.p  pI have the NextPrevious links working for the first image but I cant get it to work once the second image has faded in. Im guessing its because I need to recall the script for it to check ifelse the images are visible. My problem is that I dont know where to place the code. Ive tried the code in various places and Ive been researching into jQuery delays and callbacks to see if I can try and work out whether its the timings not working etc. But I just cant work it outp  pIf anyone can help get this working or even suggest a simpler way of creating this that I dont know, I would be greatly appreciativep  pThe images are simply listed within a divp  precodeltdiv classimagesgt     ltimg classimage galleryimg id1 srcimages01.jpg gt     ltimg classimage galleryimg id2 srcimages02.jpg gt     ltimg classimage galleryimg id3 srcimages03.jpg gt     ltimg classimage galleryimg id4 srcimages04.jpg gt     ltimg classimage galleryimg id5 srcimages05.jpg gt ltdivgt  ltdiv classgallerycontrolsgt     lta classgallerybutton idprevious hrefpreviousgtPreviousltagt     lta classgallerybutton idnext hrefnextgtNextltagt ltdivgt codepre  pAnd the jQuery isp  precodewindow.addEventListener DOMContentLoaded, function  function galleryLoop          if div.images imgnthchild1.css display  inline                NEXT CLICK             a.gallerybuttonnext.bindclick, function                 div.images imgnthchild1.fadeOut 100 , function                      div.images imgnthchild2.fadeIn                 END FADE OUT              END NEXT CLICK              PREVIOUS CLICK             a.gallerybuttonprevious.bindclick, function                 div.images imgnthchild1.fadeOut 100 , function                      div.images imgnthchild5.fadeIn                 END FADE OUT              END PREVIOUS CLICK           END IF          else if div.images imgnthchild2.css display  inline                NEXT CLICK             a.gallerybuttonnext.bindclick, function                 div.images imgnthchild2.fadeOut 100 , function                      div.images imgnthchild3.fadeIn                 END FADE OUT              END NEXT CLICK              PREVIOUS CLICK             a.gallerybuttonprevious.bindclick, function                 div.images imgnthchild2.fadeOut 100 , function                      div.images imgfirstchild.fadeIn                 END FADE OUT              END PREVIOUS CLICK           END IF        galleryLoop   codepre  pEND SCRIPTp
Negative 1508 pI am building an app that takes a few different text files and strings them together, then builds a pdf out of them. I needed to add the files text add separate times so I can add in hyperlinks to the text from each file. I have made some progress and got it to display almost accurately, but it appears CTFramesetterCreateWithAttributedString is not sizing correctly.p  pFor example, the first of the three files displays too much, in other words, after the text ends there is a blank page that comes after it. The second text file displays just fine, but the third has a large chunk from the beginning missing. I do not believe it has anything to do with the files themselves, because I get the same problem if I reverse the order in which the files are rendered. The first file whichever file it is has a blank page at the end, and the third file has the first page or so missing.

Negative 1508 pIm new to Java graphics computer graphics in general and Stack Overflow, so please help me out and help me phrase my problem better.p  pAt the moment, Im trying to display a BufferedImage alongside the original image in a Java GUI.

Id assume it works because BufferedImage is a subclass of Image... Any idea Please let me know if additional code is needed Thanks in advance p  pEDIT 1p  pI did some testing, and instead of using the original image, I created an whole new bufferedImage, and used Graphics2D to draw a line and then try and display it. here is the resultp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comrJAdp.jpg relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comrJAdp.jpgap  pSo it works. Therefore there must be something wrong with the original image or the conversion that happenedp  pEDIT 2 I did a similar thing with bufferedImage and drew a line. The result are the same as EDIT 1, and therefore I think theres some problem with drawImage function.p  pEDIT 3 I fixed the problem by putting a while loop around the drawImage to let it complete the image drawing because it returns false if it hasnt finish drawing an image yet and it worked Dp  precodeboolean x  false while x      x  hi.drawImageoriImage, 0,0, null draw the original image into the BufferedImage  codepre
Negative 1508 pI have been given access to a real time data feed which provides location information, and I would like to build a website around this, but I am a little unsure on what architecture to use to achieve my needs.p  pUnfortunately the feed I have access to will only allow a single connection per IP address, therefore building a website that talks directly to the feed is out  as each user would generate a new request, which would be rejected. It would also be desirable to perform some preprocessing on the data, so I guess I will need some kind of back end which retrieves the data, processes it, then makes it available to a website.p  pFrom a front end connection perspective, web services sounds like it may work, but would this also create multiple connections to the feed for each user I would also like the back end connection to be persistent, so that data is retrieved and processed even when the site is not being visited, I believe IIS will recycle web services and websites when they are idlep  pI would like to keep the design fairly flexible  in future I will be adding some mobile clients, so the API needs to support remote connections.p  pThe simple solution would have been to log all the processed data to a database, which could then be picked up by the website, but this loses the realtime aspect of the data. Ideally I would be looking to push the data to the website every time the data changes or now data is received.p  pWhat is the best way of achieving this, and what technologies are there out there that may assist here Comet architecture sounds close to what I need, but that would require building a back end that can handle multiple web based queries at once, which seems like quite a task.p  pIdeally I would be looking for a C  ASP.NET based solution with Javascript client side, although I guess this question is more based on architecture and concepts than technological implementations of these.p  pThanks in advance for all advicep

Negative 1508 pI know there is a lot of question already asked and answered on this subject but they dont seem to fit my situation.p  pI have a distant sqlite database  emDB serverem  and a local one  emDB localem containing photo album entries. emDB localem updates whenever needed from emDB serverem. emDB serverem has a codeprimary keycode called codeidentifiercode, which is stored in emDB localem to prevent duplicates, but emDB localem also has its own codeprimary keycode column called codeidcodep  pIf I need to create a new album on my phone I insert an entry in emDB localem with codeidentifiercode set to code1code and when emDB serverem will be reachable ask for a proper codeidentifiercode.p  pMy issue is  I do a lot of refresh and dont want to increment my primary key each time.p  pWhen I refresh emDB localem from emDB serverem I would like to codeINSERTcode new albums, and codeUPDATEcode existing ones.p  pI read about the codeINSERT OR REPLACEcode statement but it would require my codeidentifiercode column in emDB localem to be set as codeuniquecode. Unfortunately I cannot do so since I can have multiple codeidentifiercodeset to code1code.p  pIs there any way to perform an codeINSERTcode or codeUPDATEcode conditionally in a single request p  pThanks p  pEDIT  the update is done this way  the emDB localem is updated from emDB serverem. emDB localem data is never pushed to emDB serverem, the only way to add a new item is to call an API on the server which will create an empty entry on emDB serverem and get its codeidentifiercode. But since server is not always reachable EDGE3G some entries in emDB localem have codeidentifiercode set to code1code. Once the API call have returned with the corresponding codeidentifiercode we store it instead of code1code for the corresponding entry in emDB localemp
Negative 1508 pI have a .net winform application that I want to allow users to connect to via PHP.p  pIm using PHP out of personal choice and to help keep costs low. p  pstrongQuick overviewstrongp  pPeople can connect to my .net app and start a new thread that will continue running even after they close the browser. They can then login at any time to see the status of what their thread is doing. p  pCurrently I have come up with two ways to do this p  pstrongIdea 1  Socketsstrong p  pWhen a user connects for the first time and spawns a thread a GUID is associated with their web login details. p  pNext time PHP connects to the app via a socket PHP sends a GET.UPDATE command with their GUID which is then added to a MESSAGE IN QUEUE for the given GUID. p  pThe .net app spawned thread is checking the MESSAGE IN QUEUE and when it sees the GET.UPDATE command it then endcodes the data into json and adds it to the MESSAGE OUT QUEUEp  pThe next time there is a PHP socket request from that GUID it sends the data in the MESSAGE OUT QUEUE.p  pstrongIdea 2  Databasestrongp  pSame Idea as above but commands from PHP get put into a database p  pthe .net app thread checks for new IN MESSAGES in the databasep  pif it gets a GET.UPDATE command it adds the json encoded data to the databasep  pNext time PHP connects it will check the database for new messages and report the data accordingly. p  pI just wonderd what of the two above ideas would be best. Messing about with sockets can quicly become a pain. But im worried with the database ideas that if I have 1000s of users we will have a database table that could begin to slow down if there is alot of messages in the queue p  pAny advice would be appricated.p

Negative 1508 pI have a website where users upload photos using jQuery File Upload and I then provide the service of manually Photoshopping those photos and emailing them back to them when Im done. p  pThis is a demo of the upload tool Im using  a hrefhttpblueimp.github.comjQueryFileUpload relnofollowhttpblueimp.github.comjQueryFileUploadap  pThe process goes like thisp  ol liUser visits the website and uploads one or more photosli liUser fills in a textbox with specific instructions regarding how they want the photo manipulatedli liUser chooses one of three perphoto price options.  For example, if one option is 50 per photo and they upload three photos, theyd pay 150 li liUser pays for the service and waits 3  5 days while I work on the photos before I email them the resultli ol  pI have three Amazon Simple Pay buttons on the page, one for each price option.  I have this setup and tested.  However, once the user pays and then returns to the site, I have no way of knowing what photos they uploaded.  Those photos will simply exist on my server, but I dont have any way of associating them to the specific user and his payment.  What I want to accomplish is for the Amazon Pay Now button to first upload the photos I can bind a jQuery trigger event for this, then send them, along with a custom JSON packet of data to either Amazon or my own server where that data is temporarily held until the payment processing succeeds, and then email the data to me.  p  pOnce it succeeds, Amazon already sends me an email with info about the transaction, but I also want it to include my JSON data as well as the uploaded photos.p  pThe goal is to make the payment process rock solid so that the uploaded photos are always firmly associated with the payment, so as to minimize any potential errors by the user. As for myself, I dont want to ever accidentally associate a users uploads with another user, which is why I want a way for the entire payment process to package everything together for me.  Ive been reading the Amazon Simple Pay documentation, but I havent found anything that tells me how to send data to Amazon and include it in the verification or failure emails it sends to me.  p  pMy question is, is this even possible  And if so, what techniques should I use to accomplish it  p

Negative 1508 pUnsatisfied with my previous results, I have been asked to create a freehand drawing view that will not blur when zoomed.  The only way I can imagine this is possible is to use a codeCATiledLayercode because otherwise it is just too slow when drawing a line when zoomed.  Currently, I have it set up so that it will redraw every line every time, but I want to know if I can cache the results of the previous lines strongnotstrong as pixels because they need to scale well in a context or something.  p  pI thought about CGBitmapContext, but would that mean I would need to tear down and set up a new context after every zoom  The problem is that on a retina display, the line drawing is too slow on iPad 2 it is soso, especially when drawing while zoomed.

Negative 1508 pI wrote my remote pc control application. Server sends screenshots capture by Robot class and additional thread listens to Clients input ex mouse click and does the same on the server pc. p  pAfter some time I get heap overflow, probably should clean ObjectOutputStream with reset, but first thing to go faster I should work out how to compress Image object. As far as I read, ImageIO should help me, but I dont want to save it to a file or send it to a stream, just want to have a converted Image object.   Ofcourse, why wouldnt I want to send it to my ObjectOutputStream to listening clients with ImageIO.writeblablalb, blablal, myOutputStream. Thing is, Ive tried, and getting with reading or other problems, no exceptions or errors, Clients Logger says that it got two pictures which werent displayed and then stucks. While my way without compression works well in this aspect.p  pSo, I need help how to convert it without saving or sending and keep it in Object then send it via ObjectOutputStream, or maybe at least fix ImageIO usage problem. I would prefer first way dont want to have a mess with byte counting code and so on.

Negative 1508 pAre there any toolstechniques for continuous perfomance testing in .NET Ideally, I would like to find a tool, that can do with perfomance something like Test Impact does with corectness remember the previous best result, fireup a notification when I change the impacted code, then compare new test run with the previous one. I know that execution time may vary from run to run even on the same code, but I guess this issue can be solved with some testrepetition and confidence intervals. For example, if previous best execution time was t1 and new test execution time is t2, thenp  ptest is green passed if t10.9 lt t2 lt t11.1p  ptest is blue improved if t10.9  t2p  ptest is red failed if t11.1 lt t2p  pI hope I explained my idea pretty well, so are there any similar tools Yes, I tried to google it first, but with no luck.p

Negative 1508 pIm a little bit confused about Filtering and Validation, particularly the sequence that should be used.p  pWhen you are processing user generated data to be stored in Database, do you filter first, then validate, or the other way aroundp  pFiltering may correct the error that would make data valid, so if you filter first, the invalid data may become valid but it differs from the original user input.p  pIf you validate first, and you know data is valid for sure, then why even bother filtering itp
Negative 1508 pIve searched far and wide and have yet to find anywhere that explains the Regular Expression code[ ]code or, for that matter code[][ ][][][ ]codep  pIve used multiple RegEx testers and they seem to accept all input. Ive read that XSDs accept a unique form of RegEx and doesnt accept all RegEx statements, so, this may not be a standard RegEx expression I dont believe it is. The only hint I have is that the Type name is codeancode for the first expression and codeanMcode for the second. I believe, to some extent, this is an abbreviation for alpha numeric and alpha numeric Multiple but I want to be 100 sure what this is really accepting and not make assumptions.p

Negative 1508 pI have a button that has a transparent background and a thick white border. When the button detects a mouse enter I see that the background went from the set transparent background to its default focused color so for that I just set the opacity to 0.2 so that it shows some feed back that it has a focus.p  pNow here is my dilemma. When I leave the buttons bounds there is a small animation that goes from my .2 opacity to 1 before changing the background to the original transparent. I would like to know how to replace this with either a smoother animation so that I dont see the opaque background before it changing to transparent or just have a way to bypass the animation completely and just have it set my values. I see the similar thing happen when the button is focused. It will animate between 0.2 opacity and 1.0 with the default background color.

Negative 1508 pLets imagine I run an imaginary art store with a couple models and by models Im referring to the Rails term not the arts term as in nude models that looks something like thisp  precodeclass Artwork lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto purchase   belongsto artist end  class Purchase lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany artworks   belongsto customer end codepre  pThe codeArtworkcode is created and sometime later it is included in a codePurchasecode. In my codecreatecode or codeupdatecode controller method for codePurchasecode I would like to associate the new codePurchasecode with the existing codeArtworkcode.p  pIf the codeArtworkcode did not exist I could do codepurchase.artworks.buildcode or codepurchase.artworks.createcode, but these both assume that Im creating a new codeArtworkcode which I am not. I could add the existing artwork with something like thisp  precodeparams[artworkids].each do artwork   purchase.artworks ltlt Artwork.findartwork end codepre  pHowever, this isnt transactional. The database is updated immediately. Unless of course Im in the codecreatecode controller in which case I think it may be done transactionally since the codepurchasecode doesnt exist until I call codesavecode, but that doesnt help me for codeupdatecode. There is also the codepurchase.artworkidscode method, but that is immediate as well.p  pI think something like this will work for the codeupdatecode action, but it is very inelegant.p  precodepurchase  Purchase.findparams[id] result  purchase.transaction do   purchase.updateattributesparams[purchase]   params[artworkids].each do artwork     artwork.purchase  purchase     artwork.save   end end codepre  pThis would be followed by the conventionalp  precodeif result    redirectto purchaseurlpurchase, notice Purchase was successfully updated.  else   render action edit end codepre  pWhat Im looking for is something like the way it would work from the other direction where I could just put codeacceptsnestedattributesforcode in my model and then call coderesult  artwork.savecode and everything works like magic.p

Negative 1508 pI have an assignment so answer accordingly which includes a manytomany relationship between Animals and Zookeepers and Ive set my SQL to create this relationship as the followingp  precodeCREATE TABLE Animal       animalID VARCHAR5 NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,      more rows created here   CREATE TABLE Zookeeper        employeeID VARCHAR5 NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,      more rows created here   CREATE TABLE AnimalZookeeper      animalid VARCHAR5 NOT NULL,     employeeid VARCHAR5 NOT NULL,     PRIMARY KEY employeeid, animalid    insert data to AnimalZookeeper tables  ALTER TABLE AnimalZookeeper     ADD CONSTRAINT FKAnimalZookeperRelation1     FOREIGN KEY animalid     REFERENCES AnimalanimalID     ON UPDATE RESTRICT     ON DELETE RESTRICT,     ADD CONSTRAINT FKAnimalZookeeperRelation2     FOREIGN KEY employeeid     REFERENCES ZookeeperemployeeID     ON UPDATE RESTRICT     ON DELETE RESTRICT codepre  pId like to check if this is the correct way to represent this relationship, or if Ive missed something out as Im not completely confident in how this is meant to behave some clarification would be nice D. I also have a Zero or More to One or More relationship to represent, is that simply done the same way as above p  pThanks in advance, as I said its for an assignment so dont do it for me, just a bit of checking and some pointers would be helpful pp
Negative 1508 pI have a scene with several models with individual positions and rotations. Given normals, the shaders apply simple bidirectional lighting to each pixel.p  pThat is my vertex shader.p  precodeversion 150  in vec3 position in vec3 normal in vec2 texcoord  out vec3 fnormal out vec2 ftexcoord  uniform mat4 model uniform mat4 view uniform mat4 proj  void main      mat4 mvp  proj  view  model      fnormal    normal     ftexcoord  texcoord      glPosition  mvp  vec4position, 1.0  codepre  pAnd here is the fragment shader.p  precodeversion 150  in vec3 fnormal in vec2 ftexcoord  uniform sampler2D tex  vec3 sun  vec30.5, 1.0, 1.5  void main      vec3 light  max0.0, dotnormalizefnormal, normalizesun      glFragColor  texturetex, ftexcoord  vec4light, 1.0  codepre  pFor objects without rotation this works fine. But for rotated models the lighting is rotated as well which, of course, shouldnt be the case.p  pThe reason for that is that the normals are not rotated. I already tried codefnormal  model  normalcode but this applies both rotation and transformation to the normals.p  pSo how can I rotate the normals in the vertex shader before I send them to the fragment shader for lighting What is a common approachp

So I think I should try to build a hash map or hash table. Every time for one node nodex,y,z, I should check is its x,y every occurred before. How can I implement it Will it still be hash time O1 All that other way should I design the class Thank youp

Negative 1508 pHaving read this questionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8291183mccabecyclomaticcomplexityforswitchinjavaMcCabe Cyclomatic Complexity for switch in Javaap  pMy interest went towards switch statements that cannot be solved in such a way .p  pRealising the McCabe decisions should be less then 20 to guarentee better maintainability I started to wonder about Win32 applications.p  pWhen making a Win32 application one can make buttons. Now as for these buttons, putting a handler on them is pretty typical and handling the message they send when they are pressed is often done in the Win32 callback function.p  pNow as an application grows bigger, this switchstatement becomes bigger exceeding the 20. Does this mean that maintainability is worse for Win32 applications then others Java Swingp  pOr is this an exception to the McCabe complexity, and if so then in what way is this actually on par with the maintainability of other application typesp
Negative 1508 pSuppose I have an Erlang actor defined like thisp  precodecounterNum gt   receive     From, increment gt       From  self, newvalue, Num  1       counterNum  1   end.     codepre  pAnd similarly, I have a Ruby class defined like thisp  precodeclass Counter   def initializenum     num  num   end    def increment     num  1   end end codepre  pThe Erlang code is written in a functional style, using tail recursion to maintain state. However, what is the meaningful impact of this difference To my naive eyes, the interfaces to these two things seem much the same You send a message, the state gets updated, and you get back a representation of the new state.p  pFunctional programming is so often described as being a totally different paradigm than OOP. But the Erlang actor seems to do exactly what objects are supposed to do Maintain state, encapsulate, and provide a messagebased interface.p  pIn other words, when I am passing messages between Erlang actors, how is it different than when Im passing messages between Ruby objectsp  pI suspect there are bigger consequences to the functionalOOP dichotomy than Im seeing. Can anyone point them outp  pLets put aside the fact that the Erlang actor will be scheduled by the VM and thus may run concurrently with other code. I realize that this is a major difference between the Erlang and Ruby versions, but thats not what Im getting at. Concurrency is possible in other languages, including Ruby. And while Erlangs concurrency may perform very differently sometimes better, Im not really asking about the performance differences.p  pRather, Im more interested in the functionalvsOOP side of the question.p

Negative 1508 pI have been to many interviews, where always a question interviewers used to ask Do you know virtual function I always wonder why experienced programmerdeveloper use function with virtual. As much I know.. not all functions can be virtual, only those functions which are part of any classstruct can be virtual.p  pSo I think Function is superset and method is subset. Not all functions can be methods but, all methods are functions. Therefore it would be appropriate to use virtual method not virtual function.p  pCan somebody explain, why most of the experienced programmer and even technical books write use virtual function not virtual methodp

If all the disputes of a business entity have to be litigated or arbitrated to the bitter end, then this will become a substantial drain on its financial resources and big distraction for its management. Prolonged engagement in litigation and arbitration will undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on the business.ltparagt             ltparagt                 ltphrasegt2.002ltphrasegt Preventing or minimising disputes requires businesses to know and understand the people they are dealing with and they will also need to ensure that the governing contracts are clearly and carefully drafted in order to safeguard the rights of both parties. The parties need to devote resources to train their employees to carefully and skilfully monitor the performance of the contracts and to maintain proper and adequate documentary records. This requires financial investment which some businesses are unable or reluctant to budget for. However, those businesses which have a keen awareness of the need to prevent or minimise disputes and are willing to provide the financial investment to attain this will find that, with a manageable preventative dispute resolution philosophy in place, this will, in the long term, be costeffective and above all, create an environment that preserves close working relationships.ltparagt         ltsectiongt         ltsection levelsect2 numbertypemanual num2.gt             lttitlegtSELECTING A COUNTERPARTYlttitlegt             ltparagt                 ltphrasegt2.003ltphrasegt Commercial disputes inevitably arise between two or more parties under a commercial contract. The attributes of the counterparty with which one contracts will therefore have an impact on whether disputes can be prevented or, even if not, whether disputes can be resolved in an efficient and costeffective manner, which will ultimately benefit both parties.ltparagt             ltparagt                 ltphrasegt2.004ltphrasegt Consideration should be given to certain aspects of the counterparty before a contract is entered into. These attributes of a contracting party can impact on whether the relationship is likely to go smoothly or whether it is going to be ampx201Cdispute proneampx201D.ltparagt             ltsection levelsect2 numbertypemanual numagt                 lttitlegtFinancial powerlttitlegt                 ltparagt                     ltphrasegt2.005ltphrasegt A contracting party which has financial substance is, in general, more likely to be willing to abide by their contractual obligations, simply because they are relatively easy targets of a lawsuit. On the other hand, where one contracts with an insubstantial or ampx201Cflybynightampx201D party, there is a genuine concern that, once the contract becomes unprofitable or if something goes wrong, there is a bigger propensity for disputes to arise as a result of the latter seeking to avoid its obligations.ltparagt             ltsectiongt             ltsection levelsect2 numbertypemanual numbgt                 lttitlegtMarket reputationlttitlegt                 ltparagt                     ltphrasegt2.006ltphrasegt A contracting party which has a market reputation it wishes to safeguard is likely to be more careful in the type of disputes it would be likely to get involved in. Listed companies or those which have a public image to preserve are, in general, more likely to avoid litigating every claim irrespective of size unless such claims, if not litigated, are liable to open up floodgates to minimise the bad publicity associated with being in the courts too often, or giving the impression to potential future contracting parties that they are litigious and difficult to deal with.ltparagt             ltsectiongt             ltsection levelsect2 numbertypemanual numcgt                 lttitlegtLocation and culturelttitlegt                 ltparagt                     ltphrasegt2.007ltphrasegt This is a sensitive topic and therefore there will be no specific references. However, a discussion of this type would be incomplete without acknowledging the fact that businesses or projects in certain parts of the world are more prone to conflicts or natural disasters and are more likely to end up in disputes than those in more ampx201Cpeacefulampx201D parts of the world. Certain cultures tend also to be more litigious than others, and when contracting with parties of certain cultural backgrounds that focus less on mutual tolerance and cooperation, there will be more expectation of disputes.ltparagt             ltsectiongt             ltsection levelsect2 numbertypemanual numdgt                 lttitlegtFocusinvestment on risk preventionlttitlegt                 ltparagt                     ltphrasegt2.008ltphrasegt Certain contracting parties, more often seen in developed countries, have a better awareness of the law and the need to invest in risk prevention in order to minimise the probability of disputes. ampx201CInvestmentsampx201D in this regard include spending money to vet their business partners, including investigating their financial status and their market reputation, and allowing their legal department a sufficient budget to properly review draft contracts, assist with negotiations and to keep fully uptodate with the latest legal developments.ltparagt             ltsectiongt         ltsectiongt         ltsection levelsect2 numbertypemanual num3.gt             lttitlegtCONTRACT NEGOTIATION AND DRAFTINGlttitlegt             ltparagt                 ltphrasegt2.009ltphrasegt There are two basic ways in which conflicts can be avoided without the need for the use of dispute resolution mechanisms. The first is the use of negotiation skills to negotiate a contract that affords the best terms and conditions possible, covering all or most foreseeable contingencies. Having clear and favourable provisions in a contract puts a party in a better position, especially when it is sought to resolve disputes at their source, without the need to revert to the dispute resolution mechanisms provided for in the contract. This, without a doubt, is the cheapest and most effective means of avoiding disputes or resolving possible disputes. The importance of contract negotiations should not be lightly dismissed.ltparagt             ltparagt                 ltphrasegt2.010ltphrasegt The second is having a clearly drafted contract that is well thought out and planned and serves everyoneampx2019s interests. Often a hastily drafted contract that is put together at the last minute results in uncertainty and vagueness of terms which could potentially create disputes. The inclusion of appropriate clauses for example, clauses that cover force majeure or hardship provide for changing conditions that may render the contract impossible to perform are of major importance. The drafting of such clauses is relatively technical in nature and requires the skills of a competent drafter of commercial contracts to ensure that they are manageable from a commercial standpoint.ltparagt             ltparagt                 ltphrasegt2.011ltphrasegt An area to be aware of is the use of standard form contracts and adopting such forms within the existing framework of the contract. Although there are a variety of such standard form contracts available in the market place to be referred to, care must be taken, as these forms are only a guide to assist in the drafting of a contract that suits individual needs. Consulting legal counsel for advice is beneficial, especially when the contract touches on issues such as jurisdiction, which can often be difficult concepts for a lay person to understand.ltparagt             ltparagt                 ltphrasegt2.012ltphrasegt The drafting of specialist contracts such as those in the construction, insurance, commodity and maritime fields requires a great deal of industry knowledge and experience to ensure that suitable wording is used to minimise the chances of disputes. However, regardless of the type of contract involved, there are certain provisions which are generic in nature, and the inclusion of which will generally although not always minimise the scope of the disputes between the parties, and are usually good to have. These provisions are often referred to as boilerplate clauses.ltparagt             ltparagt                 ltphrasegt2.013ltphrasegt The importance of boilerplate clauses is often overlooked as the parties tend to focus on the commercial terms of the contract, such as the cost of the goods or services being provided. Failure to include appropriate boilerplate clauses may prevent a party from effectively enforcing its rights under the contract and offer an escape route to the defaulting party from its liabilities.ltparagt             ltsectiongt             ltsectiongt             ltchaptergt codepre  pand when i apply the below xslt, the counter in section taken as , everytime a new section with

Negative 1508 pBased on a previous question I decided to upgrade to Angular 1.1.4 and try out of the animation system. I am having trouble doing something I did before. When a user clicks on an element it is added to an ngrepeat element. The animation for this element then scrolls the container to a suitable position to show the element. That part works okay.p  pThere are also times when Im replacing all the elements and I dont want the scrolling behaviour to happen. Previously I managed this by putting a variable in the scope and in my custom directive looking at that variable. I would then just put a timeout to toggle the variable after loading. Now with the animation system the timeout no longer works.p  pI need a way to turn onoff certain parts of animations during certain activities of my program. How can I do thatp

Negative 1508 pI have been looking around for a long time for answers to this question but still hasnt find anything. I am creating a GUI using Tkinter, and I have two buttons that do mostly the same thing except they receive information from different widgets. One button is for an Entry widget and the other is for a Listbox widget. The callback function for these two buttons is long about 200 lines, so I dont want to have separate functions for each button. I have ifstatements in the beginning of this callback function to check which button is clicked, and then the codes will take the corresponding value. But I am not sure if the following code shows the right way to do this because apparently it doesnt work perfectly in my program. The callback function would only work for the first time, and if I click the other button I will receive an error. Here is a sample code that I created to illustrate the idea. Note that I want to check if the button is clicked, I do not want to check if the value exists. Please help.p  precodefrom Tkinter import   root  Tk  def DoSomething      is this the right way to check which button is clicked     if button1         value  userinput.get     elif button2         value  choice.getchoice.curselection[0]       then more codes that take value as input.   button1  Buttonmaster,textSearch,commandDoSomething button1.pack button2  Buttonmaster,textSearch,commandDoSomething button2.pack  userinput  Entrymaster userinput.pack choice  Listboxmaster,selectmodeSINGLE choice.pack assume there are items in the listbox, I skipped this portion  root.mainloop codepre

Negative 1508 pwe recently migrated our application IIS Server  DB Server to AWS and also modified the network architecture a little bit.  The entry point of the system is an Astaro Firewall we use the AWS AMI which also host the SSL certificate of the web server.  Everything related to the firewall has been done by a vendor and we only have some readonly privileges.p  pWe are getting 403 errors in a few situations but I will explain one, as they all may be related.  p  pWe got a form which query the database and return a report in HTML format this report also have some checkbox to do updates.  The first time the form is submitted, we always get the report back.  If we wanna post the form again, updated with new data, it crash, returning strongerror 403strong.  We noted that it doesnt crash when the first results returned a very low number of rows or none.p  pLooking at the details of the POSTs in Developer Tools, what seems to be the only difference between a working and 403 error reply is the size of the data posted. The second post is strongalways biggerstrong because it contains the data of the first report as the page have also other option to checkbox the rows. p  pAlso, looking at the IIS logs we dont see any traces of the POST that crash.  strongNothing at all.strongp  pThis problem happen only in production.  In dev environment its all working flawlessly.  The strongonly differencestrong is that the production have the firewallssl, while development is all open.  This is why we think it may be related to SSL.  p  pThe vendor is not the most helpful, we are looking for help to pinpoint the issue and trying to take the situation in our hands.p  pAny input appreciated.p

Negative 1508 pSo, our corporate web site has been using the iframe embed method since YouTube switched to this, and everything seemed to be working fine. As of last week, we started getting black boxes in place of the video in IE7 and IE9 in compatibility mode. I havent found anything here or online that seems to specifically address this problem, other then a couple of posts saying Turn off compatibility view.p  pWe can use the deprecated object embed method for single videos which isnt optimal, of course, but for playlists, it looks like we have no other option except for the iframe method.p  pHas anyone else run across this issue Has something recently changed in the YouTube iframe code Any help at all would be appreciated.p

Negative 1508 pPlease consider the following data modelp  precodedata Artist  Artist Text data Song  Song Artist Text data Catalogue  Catalogue Set Artist Set Song codepre  pYou can see that the codeArtistcodes are referred to from both the codeSongcodes and the codeCataloguecode. The codeCataloguecode contains a list of all artists referred to from codeSongcodes, so the same values of codeArtistcode get referred to from two places. p  pSuppose we were to generate the codeCataloguecode value using multiple applications of the following functionp  precodeinsertSong  Song gt Catalogue gt Catalogue insertSong songSong artist title Catalogue artists songs    Catalogue Set.insert artist artists Set.insert song songs codepre  pIts evident that the codeCataloguecode would get filled by references to the same values of codeArtistcode as the codeSongcodes refer to, thus saving the memory by not storing the copies of those values.p  pThe problem is that when I try to recreate the catalogue from serialized data by separately deserializing a set of artists and a set of songs, the application occupies way more memory than when it generated the same value of codeCataloguecode with codeinsertSongcode. I suspect that it is caused by the lost relation between same codeArtistcodes referred to from codeSongcodes and the codeCataloguecode, which is why I get copies of values of codeArtistcode occupying extra memory.p  pThe only solution I see is to first deserialize the set of artists and then to deserialize the set of songs while forcefully replacing the values of codeArtistcode with the ones from the first set. p  pSo my questions are p  ol liAm I right in my suspicionli liWill the solution I see workli liAre there any better ways to solve thisli ol

Negative 1508 pI have generated a random a hrefhttppastebin.comhQnaQYgk relnofollowset of dataa here, as I cannot post my own. Its not great data but it should illustrate what Im trying to do.p  pSpecifically, I have three treatments, the effects of which are being measured each year.

Negative 1508 pI have developed a site with MVC4, jQuery and Twitter Boostrap. Now I decided to add knockout to some pages in order to make the workflow more fluent. On this particular page the intention  is to have a list of items to the left that can be reordered with jQuery UI sortable items. When clicked the details of each item will turn up in an area to the right for editing. Depending on type the the editing will be very different so I decided to have separate DIV tags that are made visible depending on type.p  pThe previous working version loads the page items through the model. My idea was to add an observable array to the knockout viewmodel and then just load it on page load. The model is defined on the server so my intention was to not define all properties once again on the client viewmodel. Further manipulation and editing would just use the same collection and upload newchangeddeleted values to the server through AJAX calls.p  pI have read the knockout demos and searched stackoverflow for similar usecases. I think I followed the suggestions, but obviously something is missing. The model is loaded all right. The items turn up and are displayed with different colors depending on type. They are sortable and on resort the changes are sent back to server and persisted all right.p  pThe missing part is the display and editing of the currently selected item. I added another property named currentItem to the viewmodel. In the function body.onclick, .sortableItem I can verify that the currentItem is loaded and the Heading property is correct.p  pBut visibility and content of the DIV divEditType1 is not affected. Have I misunderstood the binding concept Have I misunderstood the loading from server JSON array Any help is most appreciated. p  pThis is the server page modelp  precodepublic class PresentationItemsModel      public Guid PresentationId  get set      public string DisplayName  get set      public ListltPresentationItemModelgt PresentationItems  get set   codepre  pThis is the repeated item modelp  precodepublic class PresentationItemModel      public Guid PresentationItemId  get set      public string PresentationItemType  get set      public int OrderNumber  get set      public string Heading  get set      public string Content  get set      ....  codepre  pThis is the client page irrelevant parts removedp  precodemodel MyCustomWeb.Models.PresentationItemsModel  ltheadergt     lth2gtModel.DisplayNamelth2gt ltheadergt  ltdiv stylefloat leftgt     ltfieldsetgt         ltlegendgtCurrent listltlegendgt         ltul idsortable databindforeach presentationItemsgt             ltli classsortableItem btn btnblock databindcss sortable  PresentationItemType  Itemgt                 ltdiv stylefontweight 500gt                     ltspan databindtext Headinggtltspangt                     ltspan classuiicon uiiconarrowthick2ns styledisplay inlineblock color gray float right opacity 0.5 height 14px margin 2px 4px 0 0gtltspangt                 ltdivgt             ltligt         ltulgt     ltfieldsetgt ltdivgt  ltdiv iddivEditType1 databindvisible currentItem.PresentationItemType  Type1 stylefloat left marginleft 50pxgt     ltfieldsetgt         ltlegendgtEdit Type 1ltlegendgt         ltdiv classcontrolgroupgt             ltinput typetext databindvalue currentItem.Heading placeholder  Enter Heading gt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcontrolgroupgt             ltbutton idbtnSave typesubmit classbtn btnprimarygtSaveltbuttongt             ltbutton idbtnDelete typesubmit classbtn btndangergtDeleteltbuttongt         ltdivgt     ltfieldsetgt ltdivgt  ltdiv iddivEditType2 databindvisible currentItem.PresentationItemType  Type2 stylefloat left marginleft 50pxgt ltdivgt  ltdiv iddivEditType3 databindvisible currentItem.PresentationItemType  Type3 stylefloat left marginleft 50pxgt ltdivgt   section Scripts      ltscriptgt         document.readyfunction                 Enable item sorting             sortable.sortable                                      cursor move,                     placeholder sortableSeparator,                     update function                            Create array of all changed items                         var changeItems  []                         var currentOrderNumber  1                         .sortableItem.eachfunction                               var id  this.attrdataid                             var previousOrderNumber  this.attrdataorderNumber                             if currentOrderNumber  previousOrderNumber                                 changeItems.push id id, orderNumber currentOrderNumber                              currentOrderNumber  1                                                   Send ajax action                         .ajax                             type PUT,                             url apiPresentationApiChangeOrder  Model.PresentationId,                             contentType applicationjson charsetutf8,                             data JSON.stringifychangeItems                                              ,                                             Enable change depending on item click              Note Must be done this way beacuse of the dynamic binding             body.onclick, .sortableItem, function                   viewModel.currentItem  ko.dataForthis                 alertviewModel.currentItem.Heading   Works fine                 alertJSON.stringifyviewModel.currentItem   Also looks good                              Knockout view model             function ViewModel                  var self  this                 self.presentationItems  ko.observableArray[]                 self.currentItem  ko.observable                           var viewModel  new ViewModel             viewModel.presentationItemsHtml.RawJson.EncodeModel.PresentationItems             ko.applyBindingsviewModel              ltscriptgt  codepre  pEdit An attempt to create a Fiddle demo can be found here  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netXXNz9 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netXXNz9ap

Negative 1508 pI want the main content to be displayed to the right of the left bar. Whether thats with fixed position or if theres some other way to do it. Doesnt really matter. Though, I dont want to use absolute positioning because I need my page to automatically format itself based on the size of the viewport. Also, the Left Bar isnt going to be a fixed width anyway. Thatll be dependant on a number of things and may change multiple times during the same session.

Negative 1508 pIm attempting to create a fit plane in order to predict a Z value given an X and Y. Ive used the following code a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18786328bestfitplanefor3ddataBest fit plane for 3D dataa, but the predicted Z values are dramatically incorrect, and frankly dont make a ton of sense. The plane is populated with known X, Y, Z values. The final line then estimates a Z value for every original X and Y that in no way correspond to the actual Z values. The estimated Z values are included bellow, while the actual Z values see code stick between 30 and 40 in general.p  pESTIMATED VALUES way offp  pZHat  129.6104  45.8558  157.4270  79.9675  185.5349  56.1384  6.7733  29.1776  4.7795  59.1381  0.7739  95.5122  38.3086  2.0756  58.7012  76.5445  111.0525  44.5676  29.8922  38.1766p  pCODEp  precodeX  [34.5,32.8,35.4,33.4,33.2,36.1,35.8,35.3,37.6,34.1,31.8,36,34.8,33.7,36,33,33.8,30.6,34.6,29.3] Y  [33.5,35.9,33.2,34.1,32.5,34.8,35.7,35.1,35.9,34.5,35.1,34.2,34.9,35.3,36.5,34.1,37,35.6,35,34.2] Z  [41,39,34,35,30,46,41,43,31,42,31,39,24,32,35,26,29,34,39,34]  First, remove NaNs. All the NaN if any will be in the same places,  so we need do only one test. Testing each of X,Y,Z leads to confusion  and leads to the expectation that the NaNs are NOT in the same places  with some potential. k  isfiniteX if allk    in this case there were no nans, so reshape the arrays into vectors    While Xk would convert an array into a column vector anyway in    this case, it seems far more sane to do the reshape explicitly,    rather than let Xk do it implicitly. Again, a source of ambiguity    removed.   X  X   Y  Y   Z  Z else   X  Xk   Y  Yk   Z  Zk end   Combine X,Y,Z into one array XYZ  [X,Y,Z]   column means. This will allow us to do the fit properly with no  constant term needed. It is necessary to do it this way, as  otherwise the fit would not be properly scale independent cm  meanXYZ,1   subtract off the column means XYZ0  bsxfunminus,XYZ,cm   The regression as a planar fit is now accomplished by SVD.  This presumes errors in all three variables. In fact, it makes  presumptions that the noise variance is the same for all the  variables. Be very careful, as this fact is built into the model.  If your goal is merely to fit zx,y, where x and y were known  and only z had errors in it, then this is the wrong way  to do the fit. [U,S,V]  svdXYZ0,0   The singular values are ordered in decreasing order for svd.  The vector corresponding to the zero singular value tells us  the direction of the normal vector to the plane. Note that if  your data actually fell on a straight line, this will be a problem  as then there are two vectors normal to your data, so no plane fit.  LOOK at the values on the diagonal of S. If the last one is NOT  essentially small compared to the others, then you have a problem  here. If it is numerically zero, then the points fell exactly in  a plane, with no noise. diagS   Assuming that S3,3 was small compared to S1,1, AND that S2,2  is significantly larger than S3,3, then we are ok to proceed.  See that if the second and third singular values are roughly equal,  this would indicate a points on a line, not a plane.  You do need to check these numbers, as they will be indicative of a  potential problem.  Finally, the magnitude of S3,3 would be a measure of the noise  in your regression. It is a measure of the deviations from your  fitted plane.   The normal vector is given by the third singular vector, so the  third well, last in general column of V. Ill call the normal  vector P to be consistent with the question notation. P  V,3   The equation of the plane for ANY point on the plane [x,y,z]  is given by      dotP,[x,y,z]  cm  0   Essentially this means we subtract off the column mean from our  point, and then take the dot product with the normal vector. That  must yield zero for a point on the plane. We can also think of it  in a different way, that if a point were to lie OFF the plane,  then this dot product would see some projection along the normal  vector.   So if your goal is now to predict Z, as a function of X and Y,  we simply expand that dot product.      dotP,[x,y,z]  dotP,cm  0     P1X  P2Y  P3Z  dotP,cm  0   or simply assuming P3, the coefficient of Z is not zero...

Negative 1508 pI have a django model class with several images related to each instance.  Those images follow a certain pattern and can be determined by the name field of the model. p  pThose Images reside within the project static files folder. p  pSo I have written a method for my model class to generate file paths for the images. It searches the static files folder for all files that follow the pattern .jpg the asterisks is necessary, because the filename has incrementing numbers. Once it has found a file it transforms the absolute filesystem path into an url that is passed to a view and template via a list.p  precodedef getImagesself   matches[]   for filename in fnmatch.filter     os.listdiros.path.joinsettings.STATICROOTDIR,images, self.name  .jpg     matches.append       os.path.joinsettings.STATICURL, images, os.path.splitfilename[1]   return matches codepre  pThis method works fine, but doesnt leave me quite satisfied. Here are the reasonsp  ul lipFor development mode I am required to introduce a new variable called STATICROOTDIR, to obtain the path of the static files folder. I would like to use a consistent way to reference the static root folder for development and production.

Negative 1508 pThe question is around strongNSURLSessionstrong and strongNSURLSessionUploadTaskstrong. p  pIm uploading large files to server and noticed that when I strongforce quitstrong the app the whole background upload just stops. However, when upload starts while app is running through the Xcodedebugger, then my upload completes just fine strongevenstrong when I stop the app running via Xcode stop button. I suspect that force quitting the app using Xcode simulates an iOS system command and not a user action.p  pSo my question is whether its true that iOS would immediately cancel strongNSURLSessionUploadTaskstrong when user force quit the app For some reason I would at least expect an error callback to the app, however nothing happens.p

Negative 1508 pold title How to properly delete cavas itemp  pMy proplem is that everytime i want to load a new image onto my canvas and delete the old one it puts the new image beside the space where the old one was before.  My code looks like thisp  precodedef loadtocanvasfname, canvas     img  Image.openfname     canvas.imgph  ImageTk.PhotoImageimg     l  Labelcanvas, imagecanvas.imgph     l.photo  canvas     l.packsideLEFT codepre  pI tried various options like putting one of these on top of the loadtocanvas function p  precodecanvas.deleteall canvas.gettkwidget.deleteall l.packforget codepre  por setting the variables to nothing.p  pMy Canvas is declared with these functionsp  precodedef createcanvasself, canvasframe     canvasframe.canvas  Canvascanvasframe, width200, height200     canvasframe.canvas.packexpand1, fillBOTH     return canvasframe.canvas  def createcanvasframeself     canvasframe  Frameself     canvasframe.gridrow1, column0, columnspan2, rowspan4,                         padx0, stickyEWSN     return canvasframe codepre  pAs you will probably see, I am quite new to Tkinter. My problem, to be specific, is that the old picture is deleted, but the new one not put on top of it, but next to it. p  pstrongEDITstrong I found the problem. It is the packing of the label last line in def loadtocanvas  to the leftmost space. Somehow even after deleting the old image the leftmost position for the new one was still right of the old one. Changed it to an absolute position with grid.row0, column0, stickyEWSN and it works fine.p  pThat makes the problem i asked for in the headline not accurate anymore, so I changed it. I hope thats fine.p

It would try to find the user in the DB, which would fail, so it would not attempt an insert or an update.

Negative 1508 pFirst I know that there are many similarly themed question on SO, but I cant find a solution after a day of searching, reading, and testing. p  pI have a python function which calculates the pairwise correlations of a numpy ndarray m x n. I was orginally doing this purely in numpy but the function also computed the reciprocal pairs i.e. as well as calculating the the correlation betwen rows A and B of the matrix, it calculated the correlation between rows B and A too. So I took a slightly different approach that is about twice as fast for matrices of large m realistic sizes for my problem are m  8000. p  pThis was great but still a tad slow, as there will be many such matrices, and to do them all will take a long time. So I started investigating cython as a way to speed things up. I understand from what Ive read that cython wont really speed up numpy all that much. Is this true, or is there something I am missingp  pI think the bottlenecks below are the codenp.sqrtcode, codenp.dotcode, the call to the ndarrays code.Tcode method and codenp.absolutecode. Ive seen people use codesqrtcode from codelibc.mathcode to replace the np.sqrt, so I suppose my first question is, are the similar functions for the other methods in codelibc.mathcode that I can use I am afraid that I am completely and utterly unfamiliar with CCC or any of the C family languages, so this typing and cython business are very new territory to me, apologies if the reasonsolution is obvious.p  pFailing that, any ideas about what I could do to get some performance gainsp  pBelow are my pyx code, the setup code, and the call to the pyx function. I dont know if its important, but when I call codepython setup buildext inplacecode It works but there are a lot warnings which I dont really understand. Could these also be a reason why I am not seeing a speed improvementp  pAny help is very much appreciated, and sorry for the super long post.p  pstrongsetup.pystrongp  precodefrom distutils.core

As per the snippet i have mentioned above, i dont understand what data is stored in the symbol table for numbers,is the value for the number stored in the symbol tablep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd3Bma.png altenter image description herep  pIn the snipped above the token number is given an integer attribute.And you can see it mentioning strongemstoredemstrong ,where exactly is this stored if not in symbol table Does it store the character string somewhere and  use an attribute entry in the symbol table to point to itIf then where is the character string storedp

Negative 1508 pI have created a Java Web Application that asks the user to upload an ARF File, converts it to MP4 and saves it on the server and the user is then sent an email with the link of the new MP4 file. The conversion takes place by calling a VB Script from the command line. This script converts all the ARF files that are located in a desired directory to MP4 format. p  pThe application has been working well but I have noticed one thing. It does not work when one person using one computer runs the application and say the file is in the process of being converted i.e. the user is waiting for the email. At this stage if another user using another computer tries to run the application at the same time, the conversion process gets disrupted and it stops the previous conversion. p  pI tried testing the VB Script by running it, waiting for a video to be converting and then running it again. I noticed the same thing. p  pWas wondering if there is a way to make my application concurrent so that it can run independently i.e. more than one person can run it at the same time.p  pThank youp

But I do not want to print a generated raster image.

Negative 1508 pI am working with an older JSP application. There is a custom build dojo which we are using for the modalDialog. The user enters the application and types information into the form.

Once changes are made they can save, saved to database before modal dialog close. providing they pass the validation.p  pWhen the original form is completed they submit the form for additional validation. The user was bypassing the validation on the edit students page by closing the modal dialog without saving.

Negative 1508 pI have a problem that Im having a hard time even framing for this questions title.p  pI have a library that calculates the properties of refrigerants.

Now, I am 100 sure that library is thoroughly debugged it was coded by people much smarter than me, and has been used for almost a decade. The problem is definitely in how I call it.p  pAnd that problem is this. I call the library from a codeStartFcncode callback a .m script file in a subsystem of a simulink model. The first time I run this model, it runs perfectly. The values Im sedning to the function are therefore correct. The second time I run it, however, it crashes. The inputs both times are exactly the same.p  pAlso, if I do a codeclear allcode between the two runs, then there is no crash. But if I do only codeclearvarscode or codeclearcode, I still get a crash. When I debug and look at the variables being passed in the function call, they are valid and the same both times. p  pDoes someone have any experience with this, or can advise me on what I might be doing wrong Is there something persisting within the function call that only codeclear allcode can remove and not codeclearcode Save My Soulp

It means that if I call that function in a timer, it generates new numbers per tick, but it does not change the position of the ellipse on the canvas. but if user moves the slider, the ellipse moves on  the canvas accordingly, regardless of the change of the t. Am I expecting too much Did I somehow limited output of the function If so, what should I do to call the function to move the ellipse whether the slider is being changed or not.

Negative 1508 pIm trying to get a deeper understanding of how the low level operations of programming languages work and especially how they interact with the OSCPU. Ive probably read every answer in every stackheap related thread here on StacknbspOverflow, and they are all brilliant. But there is still one thing that I didnt fully understand yet.p  pConsider this function in pseudo code which tends to be valid Rust code p  precodefn foo      let a  1     let b  2     let c  3     let d  4       line X      doSomethinga, b     doAnotherThingc, d  codepre  pThis is how I assume the stack to look like on line Xp  precodeStack  a     1             b          2              c     3             d          4                 codepre  pNow, everything Ive read about how the stack works is that it strictly obeys LIFO rules last in, first out. Just like a stack datatype in .NET, Java or any other programming language.p  pBut if thats the case, then what happens after line X Because obviously, the next thing we need is to work with codeacode and codebcode, but that would mean that the OSCPU  has to pop out codedcode and codeccode first to get back to codeacode and codebcode. But then it would shoot itself in the foot, because it needs codeccode and codedcode in the next line.p  pSo, I wonder what strongexactlystrong happens behind the scenesp  pAnother related question. Consider we pass a reference to one of the other functions like thisp  precodefn foo      let a  1     let b  2     let c  3     let d  4       line X      doSomethingampa, ampb     doAnotherThingc, d  codepre  pFrom how I understand things, this would mean that the parameters in codedoSomethingcode are essentially pointing to the same memory address like codeacode and codebcode in codefoocode. But then again this means that there is no empop up the stack until we get to codeacode and codebcodeem happening.p  pThose two cases make me think that I havent fully grasped how strongexactlystrong the stack works and how it strictly follows the emLIFOem rules.p

Negative 1508 pI have seen some previous questions, that were similar but I couldnt find anything like this. I have a webpage on a server and I would like the user to click a button which will execute a python script. I want this python script to run on the server and then send the results back to the webpage and display it. p  pWhen the user clicks the button, the data that will be sent to the server would be an XML file. p  pI just dont know where to start with all of this. What can I use to accomplish thisp  pThanks for your time.p  pEDIT I actually have the webpage all done and setup, and it produces the XML. I just need to run the python script when a user clicks on a button on the webpage. Not sure if that helps, but Im posting it. Thanksp  pI WOULD LIKE A HIGHLEVEL EXPLANATION FOR THIS PLEASE AND THANK YOU, since I dont know about what has been suggested to me already. p
Negative 1508 pI was just messing around the codeInteger.toBinaryStringintcode method. p  pWhen I pass a positive number say 7, it outputs code111code but when I pass negative 7, it outputs code11111111111111111111111111111001code.

Negative 1508 pin our application we are displaying a list of shared files in OneDrive. If they are image files, we show a thumbnail in a 40x40 square img. We get the thumbnail preview as explained here a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydn659743.aspxdisplayapreviewofaonedriveitem relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydn659743.aspxdisplayapreviewofaonedriveitemap  pThis works perfectly, however, I would like when I get the preview to resize it keeping its original ratio with max hight 40px and width 40px. Now the thumbnail becomes always 40x40 which is not a problem if it was originally say 60x60. However, when it is 96x72, it is displayed to fit 40x40. My css looks like thisp  precode.image      float left     width 40px     height 40px     marginleft 0px     lineheight 40px     textalign center     verticalalign middle  .image img      display inlineblock     border 1px solid EBEBE8  codepre  pI do believe there should be something I can do with css so that the thumbnail is resized keeping its original ratio. It would be of great help if anybody can help with this one.p  pThanks Stanislavp

So because there are 3 colors and the format is represented by 2 bytes, the number strong565strong looks more symmetric then strong655strong or strong556strong.p

Negative 1508 pI am trying to implement the custom hashing on password before saving into the database. This is a limitation of my app, to hash the passwords i use a random key, know as saltpassword, i apply the md5 on user password and than concatenate the hashed password with saltpassword and again apply md5 hash on the result, and save the password and salt password in the database. p  pNow i am struggle to login, i have an idea that i need to overwrite the cake password hasher.is it correct please guide me to fix this solution that where i need to what to get access on the login. p  pRegards p
Negative 1508 pDoes anyone know how to do the TURN portion of Ice4j Ive managed to code it so that it works when the phone is on WiFi, but not when its on the mobile network.p  pIm sending agent info via TCP and then building the connection manually instead of using a signalling process. The TCP connection already works fine, so I dont think its the TCP issue. Maybe Im building the agent wrongp  pI know that youre supposed to use a TURN server if STUN doesnt work, and I provided a large list of public TURN servers, but I might be missing something. Maybe the packets arent being sent out properlyp  pError Mostly Failed to send ALLOCATEREQUEST0X3p  precodeSep 11, 2014 33609 PM org.ice4j.ice.Agent createMediaStream INFO Create media stream for data Sep 11, 2014 33609 PM org.ice4j.ice.Agent createComponent INFO Create component data.1 Sep 11, 2014 33609 PM org.ice4j.ice.Agent gatherCandidates INFO Gather candidates for component data.1 Sep 11, 2014 33609 PM org.ice4j.ice.harvest.HostCandidateHarvester harvest INFO End candidate harvest within 160 ms, for org.ice4j.ice.harvest.HostCandidateHarvester, component 1 Sep 11, 2014 33609 PM org.ice4j.ice.harvest.StunCandidateHarvest sendRequest INFO Failed to send ALLOCATEREQUEST0x3[attrib.count3 len32 tranID0x9909DC6648016A67FDD4B2D8] through 192.168.0.85001udp to stun2.l.google.com193025001udp Sep 11, 2014 33612 PM org.ice4j.ice.ConnectivityCheckClient processTimeout INFO timeout for pair fe80000c8ce5a17c339cc4045001udp gt fe8000014e8f3fffef36a216001udp data.1, failing.

Negative 1508 pI have a data model that looks roughly like thisp  pthingy lt ports lt technologiesp  pIn other words, I have a collection of thingys, which have one or more ports, each port having one or more technologies.

Negative 1508 pmy problem is the following assume you have like 10 animation frames in tga format, high resolution. you take those, do some imagemagick on them and they end up in 10 small pngs. obviousely you want to run those as a full animation, one frame after another. unfortunately it appears, though, that the animation is not really smooth, meaning you have some kind of noise in it  and yes, you can see that easily. running the highres animation looks perfect, thoughp  pmy question is, how can i improve that how can i make sure that the frames match as good as possible after the image processing how can i tweak my imagemagick commands to accomplish that a first idea i had was to pack all the highres frames onto a sprite and extract like a colormap that i could map on each frame afterwords. what do you thinkp

Negative 1508 pI have been developing my website for some time now, and I am looking to make it even better with one small detail. Currently, when a user creates and account, they can view their My Page and do all sorts of things, including change their profile picture from the default one I have provided, to whatever they want. Unfortunately, if they were to upload an image with a ratio of anything greater than or less than 11, i.e. 300x200, then my script will resize it to fit the avatar form, but it keeps the ratio, and makes the image float to the top of the box. Here is an image of an avatar that does not have a 11 ratio img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfsRCR.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, the image is as I describe it above. The only time it makes a perfect square is when the image that the user uploads has a 11 ratio. Here is an example img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVv7l1.png altenter image description herep  pObviously, it is unreasonable to expect that a user will always upload a 11 image. So what I am looking for is someone to help me tweak my script, which I will provide, so that on all avatar uploads, even if the image has a 11 ratio, will pretty much mount the image into a black canvas, for lack of better wording, and center the image on that canvas both vertically and horizontally. Here is what I mean, using an image that I edited in Photoshop to give it the black canvasp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJCSWZ.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, the profile picture in this last image is exactly what I need my script to do.

Negative 1508 pI am looking for some feedbackguidance on modeling a hierarchy structure within a relational database.  My requirement states that I need to have a tree structure, where every node within the tree can represent a different type of data.  For examplep  ul liOrganization ul liDepartment 1 ul liEmployee 1li liEmployee 2li liOffice Equipment 1li liOffice Equipment 2li ulli liDepartment 1 ul liTeam 1li ulli liOffice Equipment 3li ulli ul  pIn the example above, Organization, Department, Employee, Office Equipment, and Team could all be different tables within the database and have different properties associated with them.  Additionally, things like Office Equipment may not necessarily be required to be associated to a department  it could be associated to a Team or the Organization.  p  pI have two ideas surrounding modeling thisp  pThe first idea is to have a hierarchy table like belowp  blockquote   h3hierarchysh3      phierarchyid INT, NOT NULLp      pparenthierarchyid INT, NOT NULLp      porganizationid INT, NULLp      pdepartmentid INT, NULLp      pteamid INT, NULLp      pofficeequipment INT, NULLp blockquote  pIn the table above, each of the columns would be a nullable field with a foreign key reference to their respectable table.  The idea would be that only one column from every row would be populated.p  pMy second idea is to have a single table like belowp  blockquote   h3hierarchysh3      phierarchyid INT, NOT NULLp      pparenthierarchyid INT, NOT NULLp      ptype INT, NOT NULLp blockquote  pIn this case, the table above would manage the hierarchy structure, and each node table would have a hierarchyid which would have a foreign key reference back to the hierarchy table i.e. organizations would have a hierachyid column. The type column would be a lookup to represent which type node is being represented i.e. Organization, Employee, etc.p  pI see pros and cons in both approaches.  p  pSome additional informationp  ul liI would like to keep in mind maintainability of this table  there will be additions, deletions, changes, etc.  li liI will have to display this data on an user interface, which will likely just display an icon to represent the node type, and the name.  li liI will have to preform some aggregations across the tree for different data requests.  li liThis structure will be backed by a MySQL database.li ul  pDoes anyone have an experience with a similar scenario  I have searched quite a bit for information and guidance on this approach, but have not been able to find any information.  I have a feeling there is a specific term for what I am looking for that I am failing to use.p  pThank you in advance for the communitys help.p
Negative 1508 pI am working on a sample project in Java, specifically Android, with OpenGL ES 2.0. I am looking to create a terrain for a player to move across. The player needs to move up and down the terrains hieght following the heightmap. The terrain is not flat. I am using Blender to create the terrain and heightmap. The terrain is being imported as an obj file. p  pThe import and the drawing is working fine but i am having issues making the coordinates follow the heightmap. It doesnt seem to follow it 100. The player moves up or down too soon every so often or  he drops below the terrain.p  pWhat I Have So Farp  p1What I am doing is importing the OBJ file into project. Reading the farthest point from terrain object and using this as the object length  this value  2 . This tells me how many vertices are in the object along one side.p  p2I then get the difference in the players position to terrain origin in world coordinates. I take the x and z values and divide each by the OBJ object length2 to give the region of the terrain the object is in. This will give me the percentage of where the x and z position the player is in reference to the terrain.p  p3 I open the heightmap and multiply the percentages above to the image of the heightmap to get the x and y position on the heightmap to read the height from.p  pBelow is what I am working with.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuQYP9.png altWhat I have so far...

Negative 1508 pHow can I get the stdout and stderr from NetBeans 7.4 on Linux If I run NetBeans from the commandline Ubuntu 14, NetBeans appears to redirect everything to devnull, according to what Im seeing in the binnetbeans script.

Ok, you do not see a lot, everything is blacked out here.img srchttpi.stack.imgur.coma0X07.png altenter image description herep  pSo, in general, we have set the signon url of the web application to a specific path called AccountSignIn. This is the controller action where we initiate an OpenID Connect challenge via OWIN. In the challenge, we also provide a redirect url, so after the user has been authenticated by Azure AD, we can redirect him or her to a desired landing page.p  pIn contrast to that, the reply url of the Azure AD application entry is set to the root url of the web application. We did this in order to hide complexity of our application from the public. When exposing a special path here, we would have to update this path if there were changes on our application logic.p  pWe have now added our web application to the Office 365 App Launcher for some users by assigning the application to those users in Azure AD. Unfortunately, the app tile in the App Launcher redirects the user to the root url of our web application which is the reply url in the Azure AD application entry, as described above and not to our landing page for authenticated users. The root url of our web app does not require authentication, so the user needs to click on Sign in in our web app to force the single signon process. This is not the desired behaviour...p  pThe question is whether we really need to expose our landing page as reply url in the Azure AD application entry Any updates on the path of the landing page will cause changes to the reply url. p  pIn addition, the app is multitenant. When making changes on the application entry in our Azure developer tenant, those changes will not affect the application entries in our customers tenants. Instead, the customer needs to revoke the access to our application and to grant access again by consenting to the requested permissions.p  pWhat are the best practices here Thanks for your help.p  pBest regards,p  pDustinp

Negative 1508 pIm encountering this issue in Java Swingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrMHcc.gif altImage of the problemp  pBoth Magenta and Green components are JButtons. Im using absolute layout for this. When hovering to Green, it overlaps Magenta even if no layout manager is applied nor JLayeredPane used.p  pAny reason for this behavior How can I make sure the Magenta stays on top when hovering to Greenp  pstrongEdit 2strong Just to be clear with my goal, the idea for this is to make a UI similar to Android Notification Bar with Assistive Touch. Assume that the Notification Bar is a layer and the Assistive Touch is the topmost layer. The problem with using a transparent layer in JLayeredPane is that if a layerpanel occupies the whole frame even when set to transparent, the layers underneath it are not drawn.p

Negative 1508 pIve been using NSRegularExpression quite a bit, and Ive been thinking that it doesnt make sense that the method codematchesInStringcode doesnt return an optional array.p  pEvery time I use this class, I have to check the returned code[AnyObject]code array to see if its count is  0 before I use it. Instead it would be much more elegant to be able to use Optional binding or check for nil if there was nothing returned.p  pIs this an API oversight or is there something Im not gettingp  precodeextension NSRegularExpression    The fundamental matching method on NSRegularExpression is a block iterator.  There are several additional convenience methods, for returning all matches at once, the number of matches, the first match, or the range of the first match.  Each match is specified by an instance of NSTextCheckingResult of type NSTextCheckingTypeRegularExpression in which the overall match range is given by the range property equivalent to rangeAtIndex0 and any capture group ranges are given by rangeAtIndex for indexes from 1 to numberOfCaptureGroups.

Lets say I want to replace the JButtons with a new set of JButtons. p This is how I do simplifiedp  precodeprivate void replaceString[] newButtonNames         panel.removeAll      Removing all old buttons from my JPanel         JButton button         forint i0 iltnewButtonNames.length i             button  new JButtonnewButtonNames[i]  Create a new button             panel.addbutton   Add the button to the panel                  panel.repaint   Repainting it so that the results show up      codepre  pThe problem Im having is that the repaint method only seems to remove the old buttons leaving me with a blank JPanel. However, the second I scroll the new buttons appear instantly so it seems like the JPanel simply doesnt repaint properly. p I tried searching for this but didnt get anything. If you know an answer, please tell me if you know another post here that has the same question, with an answer, then a link there would be greatly appreciated toop Thank you very muchp

Negative 1508 pIm calling an ASMX WS with Python SUDS.  Have been working with the namespaces for hours and Im sure that these are correct.  Looking for some SUDS experience to answer a question.p  pI cant update this Web Service without breaking other things.  Until now all clients have been .NET clients.  Before I create another service Im wondering if .NET types are a problem for SUDS  Ill explain.p  pThe Service call has a signature similar to this TakeInResultsMyTypes.Results R, string TransKey, int site, string equipmentId, string operatorp  pSOAPUI has no trouble with this  the Results type in the signature is broken out and I can use SOAPUI to push results into this call.  In SUDS, though, the Results type is never populated when the ASMX is called.  The other parts of the signature have no problems.  TransKey, site, equipmentId, operator are emalwaysem filled by SUDS correctly.  However, the Results type is always NULL after the call.p  pNow, Ive checked ten times or more the namespaces  they are all correct.  So Im asking the question  will I ever be able to fill that .NETbased type from SUDS  Again, this isnt an issue with SOAPUI.  Ive captured the packets in Fiddler and WireShark  there isnt anything strange going on.  The packets sent to the ASMX are correct and the WS is getting the submission from SUDS that is identical to the one from SOAPUI except that the naming of the namespaces are different between the two products.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 1508 pIm trying to create an embedded table with three tables for an email. The reason why Im using tables is because I want the tables to stack one on top of another when the email renders on a smaller screen. Not all email clients read CSS well, so Im looking for inline HTML coding, not a CSS solution. p  pThe content table in total is 600px wide. And within that, Table 1 is 299px wide, table 2 is 2px wide, and table 3 is 299 px wide.p  pThe first challenge I had was the row height on table 2 wasnt 100 with tables 1 and 3. I fixed that by changing the row height to 100 on the content table and in table 2. That seems to fix the row height for table 2, but then table three gets pushed down.  p  pHere is the jsfiddle a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netrobertschlotzhauersnk6pjb9 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.netrobertschlotzhauersnk6pjb9ap  precodelttable border0 cellpadding0 cellspacing0 width600 height100gt     lttbodygt         lttrgt             lttdgt                 lttable alignleft border0 cellpadding0 cellspacing0 width299gt                     lttbodygt                         lttrgt                             lttd stylepadding10px 15px 10px 15pxlineheight18pxgt                                 ltdiv aligncentergt                                     ltfont stylefontfamilyArialfontsize16pxgt                                         ltbgt                                             Text                                         ltbgt                                      ltfontgt                                    lttdgt                              lttrgt                          lttbodygt                       lttablegt                      lttable bgcolor8C231C border0 cellpadding0 cellspacing0 height100gt                          lttbodygt                              lttrgt                                  lttd stylelineheight2px bgcolor8C231C width2pxgt                                      ltfont stylefontsize2pxgt                                           ampnbsp                                                           ltfontgt                                    lttdgt                               lttrgt                           lttbodygt                       lttablegt                   lttable border0 cellpadding0 cellspacing0 width299 valigntop alignrightgt                       lttbodygt                           lttrgt                               lttd stylepadding10px 20px 0px 20pxlineheight18pxgt                                   ltdiv aligncentergt                                       ltfont stylefontsize16px facearialgt                                           ltbgt                                               Text text text                                           ltbgt                                        ltfontgt                                        ltbrgt                                        ltbrgt                                        ltfont stylefontsize12px facearialgt                                            Text text text                                        ltfontgt                                    ltdivgt                                lttdgt                            lttrgt                        lttbodygt                    lttablegt                lttdgt            lttrgt        lttbodygt    lttablegt codepre  pAny recommendations on cleaning this up would be helpful.p

Negative 1508 pConsider a cache with a line size of 64 bytes. Assume that on average 30 of the lines in the cache are dirty. A word consists of 8 bytes. a. Assume there is a 3 miss rate 0.97 hit ratio. Compute the amount of main memory traffic, in terms of bytes per instruction for both writethrough and writeback policies. Memory is read into cache one line at a time. However, for writeback, a single word can be written from cache to main memory. b. Repeat part a for a 5 rate. c. Repeat part a for a 7 rate. d. What conclusion can you draw from these resultsp  psome solution is providedp  pConsider the execution of 100 instructions. Under writethrough, this creates 200 cache references 168 read references and 32 write references. On average, the read references result in 0.03168  5.04 read misses. For each read miss, a line of memory must be read in, generating 5.048  40.32 physical words of traffic. For write misses, a single word is written back, generating 32 words of traffic. Total traffic 72.32 words.p

Negative 1508 pIm trying to add email confirmation to a model called Project in a Rails app users should be able to set an email address for a project, which is not saved until they click a confirmation link sent to the email address provided.p  pAlthough I have no need for its authentication features, I thought the Devise gem might be useful. I was hoping to use reconfirmable to implement the feature when the user tries to save an email to the project, it instead is saved to the unconfirmedemail column until they confirm.p  pIt appears, partly, to be working  the database is updated correctly, a token is generated, the confirmationsentat field is set. But no email template is rendered and no email is sent. Looking at the code path in libdevisemodels.rb I can see how, before the email field is saved to, a method is called that intercepts that save and instead saves to unconfirmedemail. But where is the email send actually triggered What do I have to do to activate itp

Negative 1508 pIm trying to divorce some of my views from my main project repository. The project is designed as a multitenant application and each tenant will be able to provide a customized set of views JSP files for their respective accounts. I want the tenants to be able to maintain and update their views separately from the rest of the application. Storing all of these files within WEBINF is thus undesirable.p  pMy research so far indicates that I probably need to write my own View Resolver. The Spring project has an InternalResourceView, an InternalResourceViewResolver, and some other classes that look relevant, like UrlBasedViewResolver. Ive looked through all of these, but I cant seem to find the actual place where spring loads the .jsp file from the filesystem. I think that just knowing where in the source to look might solve my problem.p  pWhile Im confident Im on the right track with the above, a supplemental question I have is Is it possible to configure the existing view resolver classes provided by Spring to load views from outside of the application context This would be the easiest and fastest method of solving my problem. Thanksp
Negative 1508 pMy employer uses Perforce and Bamboo in our continuous integration environment and we have a persistent problem with Perforce workspaces they are a pain to maintainp  pOur environment is set up like thisp  ul li1 Perforce server, 100s of depots, 10s of projects per depot. Sometimes projects use code from multiple depots.li liDevelopers maintain their own workspaces for their local machines.li liWorkspaces are created for Bamboo build plans. ul liBamboo workspaces include only the paths necessary to build a project.li liOften a single build plan has multiple workspaces due to the way Bamboo and Perforce interact. Parallel jobs cannot use the same workspace, since Bamboo sets the workspace root to match the build agent.li liBuild plan branches also get their own workspaces.li ulli ul  pAny time developers want to add a location to the workspace they need to update many workspaces. Its annoying and easy to mess up.p  pIs there any way to reduce the number of workspaces Are there changes we can make to the way we structure things to make maintenance easierp

Negative 1508 pLet me explain my setup since it sounds a little absurd.p  pI have a third party application that contains native libraries I need to use in spark. So I set LDLIBRARYPATH to point to the lib directory. No problem.p  pI have a DataFrame implementation that was done in scala using some of the third party native libraries I mentioned above. The DataFrame was built using SBT and has some dependencies from the the same third party jars.p  pThe third party program is written in java but has native c calls within it.p  pNow, heres the error that I am gettingp  pjava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError with one of the native c calls.p  pI think the problem has to do something with the DataFrame jar that I created using third party dependencies and the fact that its written in scala and I am trying to use it in java. I know scala code gets compiled to bytecode and should work with the JVM but I dont know enough to diagnose this error. strongThe reason why I think this is because when I run spark just using the third party application, it works great. No linking errors, no complains, even though it makes the same native c library callsstrong. But when I add the DataFrame jar, it fails and gives me the error above. The error happens specifically in the DataFrame code.p  pSo what is happening when a jar, compiled from scala code, calls code that uses native librariesp

Negative 1508 pSo I am currently building my first iOS iPhone App which I plan to launch in the coming months. I have now finished my app but I dont have a big budget so testing on multiple devices is difficult. I already have an iPad so I assume that could run an iPhone version just to check that all the code is working. If I know that the code can run on an actual iOS device the iPad will the simulator suffice for the rest of testing would you think I do plan to use test flight later on in the project too.p

Negative 1508 pFrom what I can read online, it appears that session fixation attacks are caused by sessionid information being passed through query strings in the url, or possibly through POST. For my website, I never pass the session information through GET or POST I am simply storing the session information in the SESSION That seems incredibly obvious to me, to the point that I feel as if I am missing something...

So bulking,,, not an option, unless you can make a codesinglecode query.

Negative 1508 pI am wondering how one could duplicate a codePHAssetcode and preserve the photos context.

Saving the image places it at the end of All Photos.

Negative 1508 pGood morning everybody, p  pI did a small research about it but I couldnt find anything really useful. p  hr  pLets suppose there is an Android game where each player can collect monsters. Collection occurs through a RNG which is serverside, in this way p  ol lithe player opens a magic box.li lia supposedtobe random monster is added to his collection.li ol  pEvery monster has its own rarity there are Common ones, Uncommon ones or Rare ones. In principle, when a player opens a magic box he should have p  ul li90 prob. of getting a common monster  li li9.5 prob. of getting an uncommon monsterli li0.5 prob. of getting a rare monster.li ul  pLets say there are 600 common monsters, 130 uncommon monsters and 30 rare monsters.  In the described scenario, the probability of getting two identical consecutive monsters is very low. Since it happens very often once, twice, thrice a day if someone opens dozens of magic boxes I can draw two conclusionsp  ul lieither the RNG is strongly rigged, which is indeed a possibility li lior the game uses loot tables li ul  hr  pNow, lets suppose that loot tables are indeed used. The game is technically freetoplay, but one of the many purchasable contents are the Packs of magic boxes each player can choose to buy a pack and open, lets say, 10, 20 or 40 boxes. Thus, a player cannot buy a specific monster but only the chance of getting it.p  pWhat if some paying player has a very lucky loot table while someone else still paying player has a very unlucky one They both pay, they both should have the same opportunities in the game but this of course cannot occur.p  hr  pHere it is my question strongare loot tables still allowed when we deal with yet random purchasable contentstrong Or..are there specific policies that rule how algorithms must work when the user spends real money p  pI couldnt find anything about it, nor in the Developer Content Policy, nor in the Developer Distribution Agreement, nor in the Google StandardPremier Terms.p  p p  pstrongTLDRstrong in many games we can buy ingame currency for real money, then we can use that currency to buy ingame mystery boxes.

The c interface function looks like below, as an example.p  precodeDLLEXPORT int GetInfoint num, int ChannelMask, int ChannelIndex      return cObjgtGetChannelInfonum, ChannelMask, ChannelIndex  codepre  pNow heres where I have the question, and I will provide more code to illustrate.p  pThe function GetChannelInfo also takes pointer arguments, in fact, the exact same pointer arguments as in GetInfo. p  pSo it looks like this.p  precodeint CCanGetChannelInfoint num, int ChannelMask, int ChannelIndex      unsigned char pChanIndex  ampChanIndex Class variable     unsigned long long pChanMaskTx  ampChanMaskTx Also a class variable      pChanMaskTx  Some Assignment value, lets say 5     pChanIndex  Another assignment value, lets say 6 just for arguments sake, dont care about the type.      Now this is passed to the original pointer value     ChannelMask  pChanMaskTx     ChannelIndex  pChanIndex     return 0  codepre  pMy question is this, in the first function GetInfo, why is it okay, or even legal to pass the num, ChannelMask, and ChannelIndex the way it does. i.e. return cObjGetChannelInfonum, ChannelMask, ChannelIndexp  pGenerally, when I see pointers in articles on the internet, its something like this.p  precodevoid funcint B      B  B  1   int main      int A  5    funcampA    Now A is equal to 6 instead of 5  codepre  pWhat happened to the address being passed In the functions Ive written which I have done based off a coworkers code, it does seem to work. But, I am beyond confused as to why, or how it works. As I understood it, a pointer needs an address at some point. But, nowhere in my code did that happen. Im hoping somebody could shed some light on this, and whats going on. Or maybe Im doing it completely wrong, and by sheer accident its appears to be working.p  pstrongEdit 1 num was not supposed to be a pointer. The crux of the question is in the DLLEXPORT part by the way. And GetChannelInfo is a member of a class. I instantiated cObj as a pointer object at the top of the code where GetInfo is definedstrongp  pstrongEdit 3 Why am I getting downvoted I thought this was where you come to ask questions when you dont knowhave the answer, especially when youre new. Have you all been programming so long you forgot what its like to not know Sheesh..strongp  pstrongANSWERstrongp  pstrongEdit 4 Im going to provide a little bit more detail in case somebody else runs into this. The accepted answer explains it well. What I didnt include in my original question is the matlab code, which might be something to the effect ofstrong p  precodefunction [status]  GetChannelInfonum     status  calllibTest,GetInfo,num, 0,0 codepre  pstrongWhats happening above in the calllib function which we dont see is that matlab passes the address of the last two arguments in calllib to the calling function, which I would have had to do in c or c if I was writing the entire thing in c or c.strongp
