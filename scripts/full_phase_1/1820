Positive 1820 pI am running ubuntu 12.0.4 LTS on my controller. I was trying to install qt4make using aptget, but I am getting a message that the package is not found. I need this to make and compile a file. How can I install this  Also, is there any alternative I can download  I even tried sudo aptget install libqt4 . Still nothing happens.p

Positive 1820 pIm working on a large open source project with rapid development and very long compilation time. My question concerns how to minimise recompilation after getting the newest changes from master.p  pSay I havep  precode  MyDev1   A master     MyDev2 codepre  pMyDev1 and MyDev2 only touch a few files, so if I have a compiled version of A, MyDev1 or MyDev2, doing a checkout to any of the other and running make is pretty fast.p  pAfter a few weeks, master has moved forward a lot, upstream. Several hundred files have changed I checkout master, pull the newest changes, run make, and grab a few dozen cups of coffee.p  pAfterwards, I want to do a merge that would result in the world looking something likep  precode  MyDev1MyDev1                    A....B                      MyDev2MyDev2 codepre  pHowever, If I simply dop  pgit checkout MyDev1   git merge master   makep  pThen make will recompile everything, since all the files between A and B have been touched. And drinking that much coffee will make me sick.p  pWhat I want is to merge emfromem B, and where git only touch the files changed between A and MyDev1 and afterwards the same for MyDev2, possibly recompile everything between MyDev1 and MyDev2.p

Positive 1820 pIm trying to write a Makefile that automatically calls BibTeX on files that match a specific wildcard but dont exist when I first run Make.

As a result, BibTeX is never called on them. If I rerun codemake bibcode, however, things work, because the files now exist after being created on the previous run.p  pbQuestion Is forcing Make to reevaluate prerequisites for a target the right way to fix this If so, how can I get it to reevaluate the prerequisites for bib after running pdflatex as part of lat If not, how can I achieve what I want pleasebp

Positive 1820 pcodemakecode is really good at creating files that are needed by definition of rules, but how can one easily strongremovestrong files that do not belong For example, imagine a target codefoocode that creates the files codebarcode and codebazcode in the directory codebuildcode. The target codefoocode will define how to create the two files codebarcode and codebazcode, but what if there is an other file codeblehcode already in codebuildcode Is there a way to tell make to remove files that dont belong therep  pIm not looking for the obvious call codemake cleancode then solution.p

Negative 1820 pIm working on an internal project for my company, and part of the project is to be able to parse various Tasks from an XML file into a collection of tasks to be ran later.p  pBecause each type of Task has a multitude of different associated fields, I decided it would be best to represent each type of Task with a seperate class.p  pTo do this, I constructed an abstract base classp  precodepublic abstract class Task      public enum TaskType           Types of Tasks           public abstract TaskType Type          get           public abstract LoadFromXmlXmlElement task     public abstract XmlElement CreateXmlXmlDocument currentDoc  codepre  pEach task inherited from this base class, and included the code necessary to create itself from the passed in XmlElement, as well as serialize itself back out to an XmlElement.p  pA basic examplep  precodepublic class MergeTask  Task       public override TaskType Type          get  return TaskType.Merge             Lots of Properties  Methods for this Task      public MergeTask XmlElement elem          this.LoadFromXmlelem           public override LoadFromXmlXmlElement task           Populates this Task from the Xml.           public override XmlElement CreateXmlXmlDocument currentDoc           Serializes this class back to xml.       codepre  pThe parser would then use code similar to this to create a task collectionp  precodeXmlNode taskNode  parent.SelectNodetasks  TaskFactory tf  new TaskFactory  foreach XmlNode task in taskNode.ChildNodes       Since XmlComments etc will show up     if task is XmlElement          tasks.Addtf.CreateTasktask as XmlElement       codepre  pAll of this works wonderfully, and allows me to pass tasks around using the base class, while retaining the structure of having individual classes for each task.p  pHowever, I am not happy with my code for TaskFactory.CreateTask. This method accepts an XmlElement, and then returns an instance of the appropriate Task classp  precodepublic Task CreateTaskXmlElement elem      if elem  null          switchelem.Name          case merge     return new MergeTaskelem     default     throw new ArgumentExceptionInvalid Task            codepre  pBecause I have to parse the XMLElement, Im using a huge 1015 cases in the real code switch to pick which child class to instantiate.

Negative 1820 pIm working on a custom markrelease style memory allocator for the D programming language that works by allocating from threadlocal regions.  It seems that the thread local storage bottleneck is causing a huge 50 slowdown in allocating memory from these regions compared to an otherwise identical single threaded version of the code, even after designing my code to have only one TLS lookup per allocationdeallocation.  This is based on allocatingfreeing memory a large number of times in a loop, and Im trying to figure out if its an artifact of my benchmarking method.  My understanding is that thread local storage should basically just involve accessing something through an extra layer of indirection, similar to accessing a variable via a pointer.  Is this incorrect  How much overhead does threadlocal storage typically havep  pNote  Although I mention D, Im also interested in general answers that arent specific to D, since Ds implementation of threadlocal storage will likely improve if it is slower than the best implementations.p

Negative 1820 pPlease offer advice if you can...p  pIve based my project on LinqToSQL, and the almost finished application has very poor performance. Ive fired up the SQL Profiler many times to optimize the queries with LoadOptions to reduce the number of roundtrips to the database server, but at the end of the day, my conundurum is weaved into the following pointsp  ol lipMicrosofts official advice is that the DataContext should emnotem have a long lifespan  that is  they advise you to create a DataContext, materialize objects, make changes, call SubmitChanges, then dispose. My application follows this pattern religiously. pli lipThe DataContext tends to be very clingy to its entities, and detaching and reattaching unchanged objects from one context to another has proven to be problematic when it comes to change tracking and deferredrelationship loading of the reattached objects. As such, keeping a emloaded object cacheem has proven to be problematic. pli lipWhen the LoadOptions are set on a DataContext to load several layers of relationships, the performance suffers because the resulting data is the product of the related rows, instead of the sum of them. The particular schema that Im pulling data from literally causes a 144 fold increase in the emvolumeem of data returned when LoadOptions are set, so naturally this ends up being a performance killer, rather than a helper.pli lipWithout LoadOptions being set or even when setting it at a reduced level, the DataContext does hundred of roundtrips to the database.pli ol  pIve also noticed that the DataContext ignores that an object is already loaded the first time that an object is visited via a relationship... e.gp  precodeDim allCustomers as Customers  Context.Customers.ToArray Dim allOrders as Orders  Context.Orders.ToArray  For Each o as Order in allOrders     Console.WriteLineo.Customer.Name       lt Triggers roundtrips to database Next codepre  pIn summary, the problem I have is that the performance Im getting is unacceptable for my customer, andp  ol liHolding a single, applicationwide DataContext is illadvised.li liCaching and reattaching entities is seemingly problematic.li liWith deep, multilevel relationships, DataContext.LoadOptions hurts performanceli liPreloading an entire tables data doesnt help  DataContext still refreshes the loaded object when a foreign key relationship is visited.li ol  pI really feel like Ive missed something fundamental here, perhaps in the overall design pattern Ive adopted, and would appreciate any tidbits of advice you may have for getting a loaded ObjectGraph out of a DataContext without all the roundtrips or bloated network traffic.p  pYour advicep

I have thought with the first link that I could just save the image created into a folder and save the url into that database but then I cannot go back and allow the user to change the content of the sticky. With the second link there does not seem to be support for saving the sticky at all. Id also like to create a function where adding stickies to a message board for everyone to see does so in a randomly placed way that looks natural. Any ideas for either of these problemsp

Negative 1820 pIm having a discussion with the management about Subversion practices. Ive asked them to tell the administrator to configure our Subversion repository so its possible to change the commit comments afterwards, in case I missed something even of the proofreading .p  pMy arguments are,p  ul liLog messages which needs to be improved, such as more extensive comment or wrong spelling, can be changed.li liMistakes are easily done when entering log messages, this way they can be reverted.li liEveryone deserves a second chance when a mistake has been made  li liIf exporting the source code AND comments to a third party from the repository this would be valuable if an incorrect log message is found. If the comments cant be changed or only changed in the exported text file everything would become unsynchronized.li ul  pThe cons are,p  ul liThe log message change itself would not be verisoned, thus the old message is obviously lost.li ul  pOur management rejected my change request because of increased administrative costs and higher risks to be able to change afterwards.

Negative 1820 pIve got a web page that uses a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms53587428VS.8529.aspxXMLHttpRequesta to download a binary resource. p  pIn Firefox and Gecko I can use responseText to get the bytes, even if the bytestream includes binary zeroes. I may need to coerce the mimetype with codeoverrideMimeTypecode to make that happen.  In IE, though, responseText doesnt work, because it appears to terminate at the first zero. If you read 100,000 bytes, and byte 7 is a binary zero, you will be able to access only 7 bytes. IEs XMLHttpRequest exposes a coderesponseBodycode property to access the bytes. Ive seen a few posts suggesting that its impossible to access this property in any meaningful way directly from Javascript.

Negative 1820 pI have a silverlight class library not a toplevel application with several user controls that are shared by different silverlight applications. I have gone through and pulled out several styles and brushes for the controls and put them in a separate XAML file as a resource dictionary which I bring into each control as a merged resource dictionary. Right now this works great in my toplevel applications, as long as I keep that resource dictionary as a Resource build action and reference it in that way from the controls.p  pWhat I would really like to do is have this resource dictionary XAML file as a Content build action which gets copied into the toplevel XAP, so that the XAML can be swapped out in the XAP file without needing to rebuild the project. Whenever I try to set this up, the XAML file will get copied into the output bin for the class library project, but it will never get copied to my toplevel silverlight application project output directory or into the final XAP file.p  pWhat is the best way to accomplish this The XAML resource dictionary is essentially a dependency of the class library, and the class library of user controls is a dependency of the toplevel silverlight application.p

Negative 1820 pThe Unity dependency injection container has what seems to be a widely known issue where the SynchronizedLifetimeManager will often cause the Monitor.Exit method to throw a SynchronizationLockException which is then caught and ignored. This is a problem for me because I like to debug with Visual Studio set to break on any thrown exception, so every time my application starts up Im breaking on this exception multiple times for no reason.p  pstrongHow can I prevent this exception from being thrownstrongp  pWherever this issues is mentioned elsewhere on the web, the advice usually involves changing the debugger settings to ignore it. This is akin to going to the doctor and saying, Doctor, Doctor, my arm hurts when I raise it, to be told, Well, stop raising it. Im looking for a solution that stops the exception being thrown in the first place.p  pThe exception occurs in the SetValue method because it makes the assumption that GetValue will have been called first, where Monitor.Enter is called. However, the LifetimeStrategy and UnityDefaultBehaviorExtension classes both regularly call SetValue without calling GetValue.p  pId rather not have to change the source code and maintain my own version of Unity, so Im hoping for a solution where I can add some combination of extensions, policies, or strategies to the container that will ensure that, if the lifetime manager is a SynchronizedLifetimeManager, GetValue is always called before anything else.p

Negative 1820 pNow that the oligopole of market data providers successfully killed OpenQuant, does any alternative to proprietary and expensive subscriptions for realtime market data subsistp  pIdeally I would like to be able to monitor tick by tick securities from the NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX about 6000 symbols. p  pMost vendors put a limit of 500 symbols watchable at the same time, this is unacceptable to me, even if one can imagine a rotation among the 500 symbols ie. making windows of 5 sec. of effective observation out of each minute for every symbol. p  pCurrently Im doing this by a Java thread pool calling Google Finance, but this is unsatisfactory for several reasons, one being that Google doesnt return the volume traded, but the main one being that Google promptly is killing bots attempting to take advantage of this service p  pAny hint much appreciated,p  pCheersp

Negative 1820 pDuring the most recent google io there was a presentation about implementing restful client applications.

Negative 1820 pIm trying to design a cube in SSAS 2008 for data whose base unit is MemberMonth, meaning that for each member there is demographic data, certain other indicators that may change, and dollar amounts paid per month. I feel like I need to include MemberID and MonthKey in the same dimension, but this seems like the wrong approach in the case when I just want to see dollars by month. If so, would I put both a Month Key and the MemberMonth Key in the fact table Or use a surrogate key in the MemberMonth dimension, but include the MemberID and MonthKey in it It seems wrong to have Month in two different places MemberMonth and Date.

Negative 1820 pI have one thread that inserts into the queueStream not shown here and FlowController which is another thread that pops from the queue if the queue is not empty.p  pI verified that the data is inserted into the queue correctly with the debug code in addToQueuep  pProblem is, the if queueStream statement in FlowController always sees the queueStream as empty, and instead goes to the else statement.p  pIm new to Python and I feel Im missing some simple scoping rules of some kind.  I am using the global queueStream but that appears to not be doing anything.p  pThanks for any help.p  precodefrom stream import  from textwrap import TextWrapper import threading import time   queueStream  []  class FlowControllerthreading.Thread     def runself         global queueStream         while True             if queueStream                 print Handling tweet                 self.handleNextTweet             else                 print No tweets, sleep for 1 second                 time.sleep1      def handleNextTweetself         global queueStream         status  queueStream.pop0         print self.statuswrapper.fillstatus.text         print n s  s  via sn  status.author.screenname, status.createdat, status.source   def addToQueuestatus     print adding tweets to the queue     queueStream.appendstatus      debug     if queueStream         print queueStream is nonempty  if name  main     try         runner  RunStream         runner.start         flow  FlowController         flow.start     except KeyboardInterrupt         print nGoodbye codepre  pEDITp  pThanks for the help so far.  The Queue documentation is nice and has helped me write cleaner code since the get function blocks cool.  Anyway, it still did not solve my problem, but I printed out the queueStream instance before passing it to FlowController and after, and they had two different memory locations.  That is why I believe nothing is being popped from the queue in FlowController.  Does that mean that Python passes queueStream by value and not by reference  If so, how do I get around thatp  precodefrom stream import  from textwrap import TextWrapper from threading import Thread from Queue import Queue import time   class FlowControllerThread     def initself, queueStream         Thread.initself         self.queueStreamqueueStream      def runself         while True             status  self.queueStream.get             print self.statuswrapper.fillstatus.text             print n s  s  via sn  status.author.screenname, status.createdat, status.source   def addToQueuestatus     print adding tweets to the queue     queueStream.putstatus  queueStream  Queue if name  main     try         runner  RunStream         runner.start         flow  FlowControllerqueueStream         flow.start     except KeyboardInterrupt         print nGoodbye codepre
Negative 1820 pDue to circumstances beyond my control, my production Camping site appears at codemysite.example.commysitecode.  Im pretty sure this is a common Apache  Passenger configuration issue, and Im not interested in how to fix it right now because the server is out of my control.  Suffice to say, the controller for  points there and I cant change that any time soon.p  pNow, for a long time, this wasnt an issue, because codeRMyIndexControllercode points to the correct place.  However, I serve my sites CSS using a codeRackStaticcode call to make SITEROOTpublic accessible.  This means that the stylesheet is at codemysite.example.commysitecssstyle.csscode.  Heres where the problem comes in the Camping codeURLcode method, when called in my layout, gives codehttpmysite.example.comcode, not codehttpmysite.example.commysitecode.  So I cant get it to point to the css subdirectory, because its missing a hop in the middle.  When I run rackup locally, everything is fine because this file is at codelocalhost8080cssstyle.csscode, but on the production server I dont know how to fix it.p  pMy question is there another method maybe directly from Rack that I should be calling instead  I really want to avoid hardcoding it, andor having a hack to determine whether Im running locally for debug or in production, for every rendering of the layout.p  pETA OK, this gets stranger.  Obviously Ive abstracted out some of the actual details above, part of which I think I overscrubbed.  The top level URL is actually more akin to codemysiterestcode the developercentric HTML presentation of our RESTful interface, as opposed to codemysitemanagementcode accounts or codemysiteuicode JQueryd  nice UI.  These are set up in our config.ru, via coderun RackURLMap.newHash[rest gt RestModule, ui gt PrettyInterfaceModule, management gt UserManagerModule]code, etc.p  pSo in answer to the comment below, RIndex, from a view in the RestModule, actually returns codemysiterestcode.  As an example, I have a home link in the layout, which looks like codea hrefgtRIndexcode, and generates code that looks like codelta hrefmysiterestgtcode.  The server is configured to serve files from .public directly at the site root, so code.publiccssstyle.csscode actually does apppear at codehttpmysite.example.commysitecssstyle.csscode, as noted previously.  Its emthatem link that Im having trouble automatically generating, and its because of the RackURLMap that I thought I may have to rely on a native Rack method not a Camping abstraction to locate this resource.p
Negative 1820 pThe brandnew WCFbased code needs in the meanwhile to provide a service to a legacy code that works in plain HTTP. So that, along with new SOAPed requests, I need to tailor some oldskulstyle communication on a different port to be able to receive plain HTTP, analyse the request body and send the plain HTTP with some body in response.p  pLooked at the codeSystem.ServiceModel.ServiceHostcode API but couldnt find anything appropriate.

Negative 1820 pI have a vertex shader in which I do a texture lookup to determine glPosition. I am using this as part of a GPU particle simulation system, where particle positions are stored in a texture.p  pIt seems that codevec4 textureValue  texture2DdataTexture, vec21.0, 1.0code behaves differently on the simulator than the iPad device. On the simulator, the texture lookup succeeds the value at that location is 0.5, 0.5 and my particle appears there. However, on the iPad itself the texture lookup is constantly returning 0.0, 0.0.p  pI have tried both textures of the format GLFLOAT and GLUNSIGNEDBYTE.p  pHas anyone else experienced this The GLSL ES spec says that texture lookups can be done in both the vertex and fragment shaders, so I dont see what the problem is.p  pI am using the latest GM Beta of iOS SDK 4.2p

Where should i put the jar for glassfish to load itp  p i have tried putting it in all lib folders in the glassfish dir and even inside various places in the ear only. there is something with lazy deployment i guess... so please suggest me a way to somehow solve this. p  pthank for your time,p  prajanp

Negative 1820 pI have a tableView which lists the contents of my document directory. I have some zip files in that.

When I touch songs.zip, this file is extracted in the codenewFilePathcode and its contents are pushed to the next tableView. When I touch back, the previous tableView, i.e, the four files in the document directory are listed again. Everything works perfect.p  pThe problem is, the extracted files in the codenewFilePathcode remains there itself. They occupy the memory unnecessarily.

Negative 1820 pI read spring docs on this subject several times, but some things are still unclear to me. Documentation statesp  blockquote   pIf you want to inject for example an HTTP request scoped bean into another bean, you must inject an AOP proxy in place of the scoped bean. That is, you need to inject a proxy object that exposes the same public interface as the scoped object but that can also retrieve the real, target object from the relevant scope for example, an HTTP request and delegate method calls onto the real object.p blockquote  pConfig example is as followsp  precodeltbean iduserPreferences classcom.foo.UserPreferences scopesessiongt      ltaopscopedproxygt ltbeangt  ltbean iduserManager classcom.foo.UserManagergt      ltproperty nameuserPreferences refuserPreferencesgt ltbeangt codepre  pHere, emuserManagerem bean is scoped as singleton. So, Im wondering if this proxy thing applies strongonlystrong to singletonscoped beans, that is, if you want to inject webscoped bean into singleton beans, or it also applies to the prototype beans For example, if emuserManagerem was scoped as prototypep  pIm asking this because I saw some code that injects sessionscoped beans into prototypes without aopproxy, but Im not sure if this is correct... In particular, those were DAO beans in some webapp, scoped as emsessionem, and they were injected into prototypescoped controllers, for multiuser environment. Is this the right way to go How in general should be DAOService beans scoped in webapp environmentp  pAny idea would be appreciated.p

If I curl the pages I can remove the menu bars and editing options through the use of a different css. That part all works.

Negative 1820 pI have a requirement in which the SSRS 2008 reports need to be run automatically overnight, exported to excel and then saved on a physical folder.

Negative 1820 pMy objective is to generate a graphic layout made of Richfaces components based on some input configuration like an XML file and display it in my web app. The layout is composed of graphic symbols representing various entities in the system each symbol should be mapped to an entity in the system, in order to display its state. The XML configuration file is used to define the symbol connections and positions within the layout, and their mapping rules to an entity. How can I achieve thisp  pI was thinking to create a symbol library in a technology such as SVG, where you can define both the aspect and the behaviour, and then simply wrap each SVG symbol in a dynamically created richfaces component, which would allow me to handle both the user interactions and the mapping rules defined in the symbol. Unfortunately JSFRichfaces dont support SVG images, therefore I would have to use plain HTML without Richfaces features.p  pAnother way to achieve that would be to simply define generic symbols in the XML file, each one of them with an attribute specifying the related image, the mapping rule, etc., and then generate the corresponding richfaces component from within the webapp. By doing so, would I be able to then display all the symbols in the right position and therefore generate the complete dynamic layoutp  pCould you suggest a better approach Thank you very much.p

Negative 1820 pIm wondering if there are any web.config editors for ASP.NET applications out there that are extensible.  We have various architectures being used in this application Enterprise Library, WCF serviceswhich makes all sorts of crazy changes when you update your code that arent necessary, a workflow library, Strongly Typed DataSets, custom web controls, we have custom web.config sections for LDAP queries and SSRS subscription custom settings, custom .NET rule engine config sections, SMTP settings, etc...  The file is 37 pages long  Enterprise Library has a nice web.config editor, but it only shows the information in Enterprise Library.  It would be nice to have a nice GUI to see the web.config and to show what each section is for, and to edit it without doing so in a text editor.  And even if it didnt understand what a section was, it would be cool to write an extensible control to interpret what the properties are in that XML section.p

Negative 1820 pI am a Scala programmer, learning Haskell now. Its easy to find practical use cases and real world examples for OO concepts, such as decorators, strategy pattern etc. Books and interwebs are filled with it. p  pI came to the realization that this somehow is not the case for functional concepts. Case in point strongapplicativesstrong.  p  pI am struggling to find practical use cases for applicatives. Almost all of the tutorials and books I have come across so far provide the examples of code[]code and codeMaybecode. I expected applicatives to be more applicable than that, seeing all the attention they get in the FP community.  p  pI think I understand the conceptual basis for emapplicativesem maybe I am wrong, and I have waited long for my moment of enlightenment. But it doesnt seem to be happening. Never while programming, have I had a moment when I would shout with a joy, Eureka I can use applicative here except again, for code[]code and codeMaybecode.  p  pCan someone please guide me how applicatives can be used in a daytoday programming How do I start spotting the pattern Thanksp

Negative 1820 pI want to use windowss message queue facilities to send a struct to another thread.

Negative 1820 pI am using Nginx, and need to be able to generate images on the fly.  When the client sends a request for an image, I need to run an external program to generate the image.  The external program leaves the generated image in the filesystem. p  pIt seems that the easiest approach would be to write a FastCGI script that runs the external program and then reads the image from the filesystem, transferring it via FastCGI to nginx.  p  pHowever, this seems inefficient, since I would need to write my own file copy routine, and the file is copied from the disk into a local buffer, then into packets for FastCGI transfer to nginx, then into nginxs buffer, and then finally into packets to send to the client.  It seems that it would be more efficient to leverage nginxs ability to efficiently serve static content.  p  pIdeally, Id like some way to make nginx wait until the image has been generated, and then serve it from the disk.  Another thought is that maybe the FastCGI response could use some kind of header indicate that nginx should actually go and serve a file, instead of the response from the FastCGI script.  Are either of these approaches possiblep

Negative 1820 pI use LokiFunctor in my project for a simple event system. The event has its handler function taking some parameters. In this case, it is called codePrintEventStringcode. In order to put it in the queue, the event handlers must have same prototypes  in my case, codevoid funcvoidcode. So codeCreateEventcode takes the handler, creates functor from it and binds the parameter, resulting in codevoid f voidcode prototype.

Negative 1820 pIn the past, I have seen the strategy pattern explained as a mechanism which allows the user of a functionclass to provide their own functionality for that functionclass.p  pI had always been taught that the way to implement the pattern was by taking function pointers into your classesfunctions and calling them internally, thus allowing the programmer to provide their own strategy which would be used internally by those functions and objects.p  pLooking around more recently, I see that the strategy pattern always seems to be explaineddefined through the use of an inheritance hierarchy like sop  pa hrefhttpsourcemaking.comdesignpatternsstrategycpp1Strategy pattern implementationap  pis this a difference of opinionimplementation, or is the function pointer passing not really a variation of the strategy pattern  Im mostly interested so I dont confuse people when I comment or explain my code p

Negative 1820 pAs I am sure you all know. Setting up a WebView is a matter of creating a webview browser client, setting properties and loading a resource into the browser client. I have created several android apps that do exactly that.p  pWhat i would like to try now is horizontal swiping of different web resources. Imagine a main home page at one url, a categories page at another url and a search page at another url. I would like to create a UI construct that allows swiping from the main home page url view to a view displaying the categories url and then another swipe that shows the view with the search resource think the new android market UI  swipe left shows categories.p  pI have read up on ViewFlipper and several posts here, but I am not able to find a comprehensive example of how to integrate the browser instantiation with view flippingswiping.p  pQuestion Can someone provide an example that can perform some variation of the above andor provide a link to an example that shows browser instantiation with web view flipping swiping.p  pFeel free to correct my suggested implementation... there may be a better way to do this that I havent considered yet...p

Negative 1820 pI am implementing a contact me form that will send an email when it is submitted. I needed this form to emit custom HTML, so I ended up using monadic forms. The problem is that I do not know how to use a monadic form.p  pthe code is below. I have omitted the part that sends email for brevity. the problem is that my form never validates correctly. the form result is never codeFormSuccesscode in my codepostContactRcode function.p  pIt seems that I do not initialize the form correctly when I call coderunFormPostcode inside codepostContactRcode. I always pass codeNothingcode instead of the actual codeContactDatacode to codecontactFormcode and I do not know how to construct my codeContactDatacode from the request. Is my understanding of the problem correct I am trying to work with poorly documented features. p  pany helpp  pEDIT what looks strange is that validation errors do show up in the form if I submit an invalid form, so the request data does get read at some point. what does not work is that when there are no errors I do not get redirected to codeRootRcodep  pcodepre  LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings   LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes   LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell br module Handler.Contact wherebr import Control.Applicative lt, lt import Data.Text Text import Foundation import Network.Mail.Mimebr data ContactData  ContactData                     contactName     Text                    , contactEmail    Text                    , contactMessage  Textarea                                      deriving Showbr contactForm d  html  do     r1, v1 lt mreq textField Your name contactName lt d     r2, v2 lt mreq emailField Your email contactEmail lt d     r3, v3 lt mreq textareaField Message contactMessage lt d     let views  [v1, v2, v3]     return ContactData lt r1 lt r2 lt r3, widgetFile contactformbr getContactR  Handler RepHtml getContactR  do     , form,  lt runFormPost contactForm Nothing     defaultLayout  do         setTitle contact         addWidget widgetFile contactbr postContactR  Handler RepHtml postContactR  do     r, form,  lt runFormPost contactForm Nothing     case r of         FormSuccess d  do             sendEmail d             setMessage Message sent             redirect RedirectTemporary RootR           getContactR precodep

Negative 1820 pI have an MVC2 project that has a page on it that is supposed to call a jquery function.  When you click on the button via the mouse my jquery function is called.  I of course have a .click function call on my button ID.  My guess is that I am simply performing a form submit when I press enter instead of going through the click motion.  Is there a way that I can either have the enter button do the same thing as the .click or at least use jquery or anything as a matter of fact to disable the enter button so that a user can not hit enter and will have to press via the mousep  pAny ideas will be greatly appreciated.  In the meantime, I will continue to scour the internet to figure out what I can do for this.p  pthanks.p

Negative 1820 pIve been reading Design Patterns, by Gamma et al. and Im a little confused.  I got to the bit concerning the Template Method.  That is, you template classes with policies for various things, rather than coding the policy into the class.  It all sounds very reasonable to me.  But here I hit a bit of a conceptual brick wall.  If you instantiate a class with a policy object, the policy object needs to have an abstract interface in order that the programmer can write different policies that all compile into the class without error.  If youre going to define an abstract IPolicy for these policy objects, why not just use dependency injection and pass in the IPolicy on constructionp  pCan anyone shed any light on why you would prefer the template method to dependency injectionp  pThanks.p

Negative 1820 pWould the following single threaded UDP client application see a performance benefit from using epoll over simply calling recvfromsendto on nonblocking socketsp  pLet me explain the client.p  pI am writing single threaded UDP based client custom protocol that both sends and receives data using nonblocking IO and my colleague suggested I use epoll for this. The client sends and receives multiple packets of information that are all associated with a unique session id and multiple sessions can be run simultaneously.p  pIf I use epoll, there will be a limited number of maybe 1020 file descriptors which epollwait could wait on.  Each file descriptor would be associated with one session.  So thats maximum 10  20 sessions and this number will be enforced.p  pEach session has its own state machine.  From a single thread I need to run each state machine reasonably frequently and poll the associated socket as well.p  pIn my case, Id have to use epollwait with a timeout of zero or some very small value so that I can give CPU time to run the state machines for each session. If there is data for a session then it needs to be directed to the associated state machine.p  pHowever, I cant really see much benefit of this design with such a small number of file descriptors.p  pThe way I see it is I have two design options 1. In my main loop using epoll I can poll the descriptors using epollwait with either a small timeout or no timeout.  p  pHow it handles data at this point is where Im getting a bit stuck... either I read it right away and then throw it into a queue for each state machine to pick up when its run, or I set a flag on the state machine to tell it that data is waiting and when the state machine runs itll pick it up with a call to recvfrom.  Or, I read the data and handle it right away and run the state machine for it.p  pOr... 2, Just run each state machine from the main loop and call recvfrom.  If I get some data, handle it. If I dont then do whatever else the state machine requires.  Is there huge overhead calling recvfrom when there is no datap  pWith going the epoll route Im coding in some extra complexity. If there is a strong likelyhood for it be faster in my case then I will start doing it.  However, if the second way which really simple works just as well then I would not use epoll.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 1820 pIm still working on routines for arbitrary long integers in C. So far, I have implemented additionsubtraction and multiplication for 64bit Intel CPUs.p  pEverything works fine, but I wondered if I can speed it a bit by using SSE. I browsed through the SSE docs and processor instruction lists, but I could not find anything I think I can use and here is whyp  ul lipSSE has some integer instructions, but most instructions handle floating point. It doesnt look like it was designed for use with integers e.g. is there an integer compare for lesspli lipThe SSE idea is SIMD same instruction, multiple data, so it provides instructions for 2 or 4 independent operations. I, on the other hand, would like to have something like a 128 bit integer add 128 bit input and output. This doesnt seem to exist. Yet In AVX2 maybepli lipThe integer additions and subtractions handle neither input nor output carries. So its very cumbersome and thus, slow to do it by hand.pli ul  pMy question is is my assessment correct or is there anything I have overlooked Can long integer routines benefit from SSE  In particular, can they help me to write a quicker add, sub or mul routinep

Negative 1820 pI am testing a very simple .NET Webservice hosted in IIS. The webservice is just a single method performing a simple calculation and returning an integer. I have configured JMeter on a separate server to test this method using 500 threads, each looping 500 times. The method is therefore being called 250,000 times and I graph the throughput and response times. p  pMy graphs therefore contains 250,000 points showing throughput and response time. However, both throughput and response time graphs show highly regular outliers in the dataset. At very regular intervals there is a very brief drop in throughput and a corresponding rise in response time. Out of the 250,000 points on each chart there between 50 and 75 such outliers.p  pAlthough this is a very small percentage, and the effect on overall performance is not an issue, I would like to understand what the cause of the outliers could be. My only theory thus far is that synchronous garbage collection in asp.net causes the application to pause for a fraction of second at regular intervals. p  pI would like to know whether the garbage collector could be responsible for these drops in throughputincreases in response times or not p  pIf not, there is likely some OS issue, but there is no need for speculative answers here. p

Negative 1820 pI have sample Json and I need to serialize it into C objects. I decided to leverage for this purpose a hrefhttpjson.codeplex.com relnofollowJson.Neta library.

Negative 1820 pThe .NET 4.5 framework libraries integrate Cstyle Taskbased async fairly extensively. In many cases, they also continue to expose APMstyle BeginEnd method pairs. F can easily adapt either method to Fstyle asynchronous computations. p  pMy question is, given an IObound operation thats implemented in the framework as both BeginEnd and Taskbased async, is there a performance or memory advantage to choosing one over the other when adapting to F asyncp  pFor example, in .NET 4.5, codeSystem.IO.Streamcode has both a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.io.stream.beginread28vvs.11029.aspxBeginReada and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh13781328vvs.11029.aspxReadAsynca.

The repository also needs all kinds of functions to retrieve data for me and to store it. Plus it needs to work with Entity models. So i have to create all of those too.p  pTo me that looks like alot of stuff do... When i could simply get the data like i described above with an ORM. And i could store it just as easyp  pORMstoreuserp  pIn this case it would not only store the user object to the database, but also any changes i made to the Roles object aswell.

Negative 1820 pI have a codeUITableViewcode whose cells have an image from a URL placed in its codeimageViewcode.p  pThe image isnt square is landscape, however it initially loads as a square in the manner in which codecontentModecode is codescaleAspectFillcode and codesetClipsToBoundscode is codeYEScode. So far so good.p  pHowever, when I touch down on the cell, the image widens, that is, it retains the codescaleAspectcode part, but now bleeds out to the right as if codesetClipsToBoundscode is codeNOcode.p  pThe same behavior occurs if the rowcell goes out of view and comes back in recycled, in which case I have the image obtained from an inmemory cache rather than from the URL.p  pIve tried explicitly setting both codecontentModecode and codesetClipsToBoundscode for the codecell.imageViewcode, but it seems to have no effect. Any advise Thanks.p  pBefore touchdownp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comIHN9c.png altbefore touchdownp  pAfter touchdown or recycle from cachep  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comHBAyF.png altafter touchdownp

Negative 1820 pI am trying to analyze a large corpus of documents, which are in a huge file 3.5GB, 300K lines, 300K documents, one document per line. In this process I am using Lucene for indexing and Lingpipe for preprocessing.p  pThe problem is that I want to get rid of very rare words in the documents. For example, if a word occurs less than MinDF times in the corpus the huge file, I want to remove it. p  pI can try to do it with Lucene Compute the Document Frequencies for all distinct terms, sort them in ascending order, get the terms that have DF lower than MinDF, go over the huge file again, and remove these terms line per line. p  pThis process will be insanely slow.

Negative 1820 pIm writing a control which inherits from a DataGridView. One of the things I would like to do is to handle the bug whereby a columns format provider is not used without handling the CellFormatting event emand doing the formatting myselfem.p  pI thought I would write an OnCellFormatting method which says emif theres a column format provider, and theres no CellFormatting event handlers, do the formattingem.p  pThe important bit I thought was em...and theres no CellFormatting event handlerem.p  pNow, in the past when Ive written controls with events, Ive done something like thisp  precode  public event EventHandler SomethingHappened    protected void OnSomethingHappenedEventArgs e         EventHandler handler  this.SomethingHappened      if handler  null handlerthis, e    codepre  pThis works fine and my understanding is that this pattern determines if handlers are attached to the event and, if so, invoke those handlers. Fair enough, but why cant I do thisp  precode  protected void OnCellFormattingEventArgs e         EventHandler handler  this.CellFormatting      if handler  null DoSomething    codepre  pThe error is The event System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellFormatting can only appear on the left hand side of  or p  pWhats different about this type of event p  pIf I go to the definition of the event, and create my own, ie.p  ppublic event DataGridViewCellFormattingEventHandler CellFormatting2p  p...the compiler is quite happy to assign this to my handler variable, so my question is  whats different with the CellFormatting event emand, one presumes, many othersem that I cannot determine if there are any event handlers for it p  pThanks, Rossp

Negative 1820 pAs far as I understand it, any program gets compiled to a series of assembly instructions for the architecture it is running on. What I fail to understand is how the operating system interacts with peripherals such as a video card. Isnt the driver itself a series of assembly instructions for the CPU p  pThe only thing I can think think of is that it uses regions of memory that is then monitored by the peripheral or it uses the BUS to communicate operations and receive results. Is there a simple explanation to this process.p  pSorry if this question is too general, its something thats been bothering me.p

Negative 1820 pIn part of my PHP application, I need to make an REST style API call and continue working.  I dont care about the result of the API call so I dont need to see the return value but I do need to be able to just fire it off and continue working.p  pIf I use codefilegetcontentscode to do this, then it will wait until the url returns.  I can set a timeout in CURL but the smallest timeout it allows is one second so this is not very useful.

It probably isnt very normal to request a URL and not care about what comes back but this is what I need Anyone know howp

Negative 1820 pIm writing a malloc function for a college assignment.  Heres a basic layout of my ideap  p1Define a node struct with pointers to previous node, next node, as well as a char for size and vacancy.  Each region in the heap will contain a hidden node with this information.p  p2Malloc function.  Starting with first node loop through each node checking for vacancy.  If a node is vacant and is large enough return a ptr to the beginning of the region not including the node. If no space is available use sbrk to allocate requested space PLUS space for a node. p  p3Free function. Go to pointer passed as parametersizeofstruct node and set the vacancy to vacant.  Then starting with the beginning of the list, traverse the list merging adjacent free spaces.p  pHow does this approach sound  My main concern is with actually starting the linked list.  For instance, should I create a node with sbrk before I start to do any allocations and store a ptr to it as a global variable If so how do I initialize a first node before I allow the malloc function to be called by a driver programp  pThanks in advance.  Im not asking for someone to write my code, only to provide some insight and suggestions regarding my ideas. p

Negative 1820 pI believe Im asking a slightly different take on the perennial question of avoiding code repetition.  The setup is fairly standarda bunch of if statements taking similar actions.  Below youll find a short example.p  pIm trying to figure out the best way to tackle situations like this, in terms of code efficiency, compactness, and programmer ease.  Note that separate solutions addressing each of those points are fine, indeed preferable, as I doubt one solution hits all three.p  pFor example, one possible solution that came to mind seems like it would be ungainly and slow, especially on a mobile device like android, plus it would only work if the variables were instance variables, and not merely local which may very well be the case.  The idea involved a for statement whose initialization expression would use doublebrace initialization to fill a hashmap with strings corresponding to the variables involved e.g. installText maps to installPermission, then the forloop would contain one of the ifelseifelseif clauses below, which would use reflection to access the variables by their names stored in the hashmap.p  pHow can I do this better  Thanks in advance for your time and advicep  precodeif installText.equalsDefault      installPermission  DEFAULT  else if installText.equalsAllow      installPermission  ENABLED  else if installText.equalsDisallow      installPermission  DISABLED  if uninstallText.equalsDefault      uninstallPermission  DEFAULT  else if uninstallText.equalsAllow      uninstallPermission  ENABLED  else if uninstallText.equalsDisallow      uninstallPermission  DISABLED  if runText.equalsDefault      runPermission  DEFAULT  else if runText.equalsAllow      runPermission  ENABLED  else if runText.equalsDisallow      runPermission  DISABLED  codepre

Negative 1820 pLet me begin with a brief explanation of the system I am usingp  pWe have a system that runs as a Daemon, running workunits as they come in. This daemon dynamically creates a new Thread when it is given a new workunit. For each of these units of work, I need Log4J to create a new log file to append to  the filename will be provided at runtime, when the new log file must be created. This daemon must be able to remain alive indefinitely, which I believe causes some memory concerns, as I will explain.p  pMy first thought was to create a new Logger for each workunit, naming it after the thread, of course. The workunits thread retains a reference to that Logger. When the unit is finished, it will be garbagecollected, but the problem is that Log4J itself retains a reference to the Logger, which will never be used again. It seems likely that all these Loggers will cause the VM to run out of memory.p  pAnother solution subclass Filter, to filter Appenders by the thread names, and place them on the same Logger. Then, remove the Appenders as the workunits complete. Of course, this necessitates adding the code to remove the appenders. That will be a lot of code changes.p  pIve looked into NDC and MDC, which appear to be intended for managing interleaved output to the same file. Ive considered proposing this as a solution, but I dont think it will be accepted.p  pI want to say that Log4J appears that it is intended emnotem to function this way, that is, dynamically creating new log files at runtime, as they are required or desired. So I am not sure which direction to look in next  Is log4j not the solution here, or did I comPLETELY miss something Have I not looked closely enough at NDC Or is my concern with Log4J holding onto Loggers a nonissue for reasons I dont seep

Negative 1820 pI have an Access 2007 database that has a number of tables, some are fairly large 100,000 records I have created a codeunion querycode to pull some of the same types of data from multiple tables into one large query for pivot table manipulation and reporting.  For examplep  precodeSELECT Language FROM Table1 UNION ALL SELECT Language FROM Table2 UNION ALL SELECT Language FROM Table3 codepre  pThis works.  I found, quickly, however, that a codeunion querycode will not show up when connecting to the datasource from Excel 2007.  So, I created a second query to reference the codeunion querycode.  Like sop  precodeSELECT  FROM [The Above Union Query] codepre  pThis query works and it, initially, was accessible from Excel.  Time passed, Ive added more data.  Suddenly, when I connect to my Access database from Excel my query referencing the union has disappeared.  MS Access shows no signs of an issue data displays in Access and my other nonunion queries are showing up in Excel 2007 ... but not the one that references the union.p  h3What could be going on  Why did it disappearh3  pI noticed if I switch some of the referenced tables in the codeunion querycode to a smaller table with less rows all of sudden the query appears in Excel again.  At least, I think thats what the difference is.  I really cant put my finger on why some of the codeunion queriescode wont show up and some will.p  pAm stumped and need some guidance.  Thanks.p
Negative 1820 pI am working on a reader app. when you read one magazine, it will display first five pages and  download the rest pages one by one. there is a scrollview to view the thumbnail image of pages. At the beginning, if the page needs downloading, the corresponding thumbnail views alpha value is set to 0.5 the thumbnail images are in the file,no need to download. when the page is downloaded, i will update the thumbnail views value to 1.0. I use one operation to download the page, and when one is downloaded i use delegate to set thumbnail views alpha.

So, if program A is accessing memory at physical address like p  pcode0x00000000, 0x20000000, 0x40000000...code p  pand program B accessing data at p  pcode0x10000000, 0x30000000, 0x50000000...code p  pSince these addresses share the same suffix, the related set in L2 cache will be flushed frequently. And were expected to see two programs fighting with each other, reading data slowly from memory instead of cache, although, they are separated in different cores.p  pThen I want to verify the result in practice. In this experiment, I have to know the physical address instead of virtual address. But how can I cope with thisp  hr  pstrongThe first attemptstrong p  pEat a large space from heap, mask, and get the certain address.p  pMy CPU has a L2 cache with size2048KB and associativity8, so physical addressess like code0x12340000, 0x12380000, 0x123c0000code will be related to the first set in L2 cache.p  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeint HEAP[200000000]0 int v[2] int mainint argc, char argv       v[0]  intunsignedHEAP0x3fffc amp 0xfffc0000     v[1]  int unsignedv[0]  0x40000        one program pollute v[0], another polluting v[1]  codepre  pSadly, with the help of virtual memory, variable codeHEAPcode is not always continuous inside physical memory. codev[0]code and codev[1]code might be related to different cache sets.p  hr  pstrongThe second attemptstrongp  paccess codeprocselfmemcode, and try to get memory information.p  pHmm... seems that the results are still about virtual memory.p

Negative 1820 pMy question is a bit specific to the scenario Im facing. I wasnt really sure what to search for to find and answer to it here. p  pIm working on developing some CUDAbased programs as part of my research. I have access to a supercomputing cluster with GPU nodes  a hrefhttpwww.rcac.purdue.eduuserinforesourcescarter relnofollowhttpwww.rcac.purdue.eduuserinforesourcescartera . And my development machine, being a 13 late 2011 MacBook Pro, doesnt have an nVidia GPU. p  pThere are two ways I can run CUDA apps on the node. I can either use qsub to schedule a job and wait for it to run and get the output files. Or I can start an interactive shell on the gpunode itself using the qsub I command. This has some waiting time associated with starting it, but once it starts, I can pretty much run apps in realtime as if Im on my local machine.p  pNow, I use something like TextMate or TextWrangler to write my code. Is there any way I can run a command in THAT terminal  the qsub I one  directly from my text editor  or any editor . This way, I will be able to make changes and test them much faster than manually copying the file to the server, compiling and running it there. p  p Thomasp

Negative 1820 pI use wordpress.org and bluehost for my site www.thekatsup.comp  pThe home page is a bunch of album covers and then you click an album and it opens up to the post with the songs cover image, an audio link, and a download link.p  pThe image is set through the featured image option so I cant change it in the post via HTML, it must be done through CSS.p  pFrom toying with it Ive found that toying with a hrefhttppostimage.orgimagehhl5g1hwf relnofollowthisa screen shot part of the CSS moves around the album cover, but then it also moves my other images in the post.p  pIs there a way to center the album cover for all my albumsp
Negative 1820 pIs there any way to display AdMob ads using only pure JavaScript Or in any other way, that I can use it directly in PhoneGap application built with PhoneGap Buildp  pIm developing mobile apps using PhoneGap. Ive seen many solutions and approaches to this problem like a hrefhttptherockncoder.blogspot.jp201205cordovaphonegapandadmobtogetherios.htmlthisa or a hrefhttpfczaja.blogspot.com201209admobadsinphonegapapps.htmlthisa. But since Im using PhoneGap Build only, I cant use any of it. Ive seen a hrefhttpsgithub.comrajpara11phonegappluginstreemasterAndroidAdMobPluginAdMob Cordova Plugina, but since it is platformoriented currently only available for iOS and Android and has a lot of Java and SDK in documentation, Im pretty sure, that I cant use it in app compiled with PhoneGap Build.p  pIf there is no way to get AdMob via JS, then maybe there is another ad provider, which API is reachable entirely from JavaScriptp  pIve heard that a hrefhttpwww.millennialmedia.comMillenialMediaa can display ads using pure JavaScript and even allows external ads providers like AdMob. So this would be a perfect solution for me. But their page is so poorly organised a lot of selfmarketing blabla and no actual links to some API, examples or docs, at least no, when youre not logged in, that I cant confirm that it supports both JavaScript and AdMob. Does someone have any experience with this system and can confirm this p
Negative 1820 pI use PDFBox to extract text from PDF using perl to call the java class. It works well with text only PDF. But, if there images in the pages, the text format is broken. Line breaks after only a few words. A sample of the pdf can be found in a hrefhttpijeei.orgdocs13028992904f8bd9bf648f0.pdf relnofollowhttpijeei.orgdocs13028992904f8bd9bf648f0.pdfa and the extracted text can be found in a hrefhttpastrajingga.co.idjournaldocs13028992904f8bd9bf648f0.txt relnofollowhttpastrajingga.co.idjournaldocs13028992904f8bd9bf648f0.txta . Pay attention to the last page. As you can see, the text format is broken. Has anyone have this problem What should I do I only want to get the text as is in the PDF file.p  pIm using PDFBox 1.1.0, FontBox 1.0.0p
Negative 1820 pOk, so I have a bunch of classes and Id like to rotate an object which has an object shape, which is a 2d array and thats constructed in the parent class of the object class.

At the moment, I am dealing with two fragments, the first is my user interface for the page, the second is a custom list view. Both fragments will displayed at the same time, on on top of the other. In the first, the user can choose the date, which will then be used in a database call to get the list items for that date. p  pWhat I am trying to figure out is first, how to pass the date between the two open fragments and update the second fragment when the date is changed in the first.

Negative 1820 pMy current assignment is to move rows of data between 2 Kendo Ui grids when a user clicks a button in that row. I have code that actually works, but I dont understand why and was hoping someone could explain it. I am also wondering if there is a better approach or one that makes sense to accomplish this task. The environment is Winsows 7, VS2012, MVC4, Kendo UI, jquery 1.8. The part I dont understand is the moveTo function. The part starting with     var row  elem.currentTarget.closesttr and the whole toDS.add.... is very confusing. It seems like to me that Im looping through each cell in the row and adding that to the toDs, but why all the fields Seems like I should be doing something like what is commented out below that, but that doesnt work.p  pOther things to note. I have seen a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netOnaBai2qXKy relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netOnaBai2qXKya but the customer does not want to use selections in the grids, they want to have individual buttons.

Negative 1820 pI am building a Raspberry Pi wearable computer and as a result am not able to hook up a full sized keyboard to the Pi I dont have one that is not full sized.  Instead I have a numeric keypad USB attachment which functions as a keyboard, but only the numeric keypad part 09, a triple 0, , , ,  and numlock.p  pNow my question is how would one go about writing a scriptprogram to run in the background that will change input keypresses to other keypresses, for example, changing 777 in rapid succession to c or 5 to x.  This way I hope to be able to type, albeit slowly at first, using only 16 keys.  What libraries are a good idea and do you have any sample usage of them.p  pIdeally this should work both in the startup command prompt RPi doesnt run X immediately and in the X environment.p
Negative 1820 pOk, I get this all recursion is more functional because you are not changing the state of any object in an iteration. However there is nothing stopping you do this in scala.p  precode  var magoo  7     def mergeSortxs List[Int] List[Int]       ...     magoo  magoo  1     mergeSortxs1, xs2     codepre  pIn fact, you can make recursion just as side effectless in Scala as you can in Java. So is it fair to say that Scala just make it easier to write concise recursion by using pattern matching  Like there is nothing stopping me writing any stateless recursion code in Java that I can write in Scalap  pThe point is really that in Scala complex recursion can be achieved with neater code. Thats all. Correctp

A first pass, emnonemwaitfree implementation of this might look something likep  precode idvalue      id retVal  nil     synchronizedself              retVal  [mValue retain]          if retVal              retVal  [[mGenerator retain] retain]  Once for the ivar and once for the return value         id oldVal  nil         synchronizedself                      oldVal  mValue             mValue  retVal                  [oldVal release]          return [retVal autorelease]    voidinvalidate      id val  nil     synchronizedself              val  mValue         mValue  nil          [val release]  codepre  pNaturally, this results in crappy read performance because concurrent reads are serialized by the lock. A readerwriter lock improves things from this, but is still quite slow in the read path. The performance goal here is for cached reads to be as fast as possible hopefully lockfree. Its OK for reads to be slow if we have to calculate a new value, and its OK for codeinvalidatecode to be slow.p  pSo... I am trying to figure out a way to make reads lockwaitfree. My first flawed  see below thought involved adding an invalidation counter whose value is atomically, monotonically incremented and read using memory barriers. It looked like thisp  precode idvalue       I think we dont need a memory barrier before this first read, because      a stale read of the count can only cause us to generate a value unnecessarily,      but should never cause us to return a stale value.     const int64t startCount  mWriteCount      id retVal  [mValue retain]      OSMemoryBarrier  But we definitely want a fresh read here.     const int64t endCount  mWriteCount      if retVal ampamp startCount  endCount              return [retVal autorelease]            Now were in the slow path     retVal  [mGenerator retain]  we assume generator has given us an autoreleased object      synchronizedself              mValue  retVal         OSAtomicIncrement64BarrierampmWriteCount          return retVal    voidinvalidate      id value  nil     synchronizedself              value  mValue         mValue  nil         OSAtomicIncrement64BarrierampmWriteCount          [value release]  codepre  pBut I can already see problems here.  For instance, the code[mValue retain]code in the read path we need the value to be retained, but its possible that in the time between the read of codemValuecode and the call to coderetaincode another thread could codeinvalidatecode, causing the value to have been dealloced by the time the retain call is made. So this approach wont work as is. There may be other problems too.p  pHas anyone already worked something like this out and care to share Or have a pointer to something similar in the wildp

Most of that is already working, except of course the sorting process.p  pThanks for your time......RDKp
Negative 1820 pIs it possible to modularize the appmodels folder adding packages into it in play2.1 framework javap  pActually I have to put all of my classes models into appmodels folder, otherwise play framework cant find my classes on compilation time. I really dont like to have all of my classes into a single folder.p  pI did a research about play2 projects on github and most of them are simple and have all of their models into appmodels with no packages into this folder as the samples bundled with the framework.p  pDo you add packages into appmodels folder in your project If so, do you have to configure something elsep  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 1820 pI am trying to login a user via facebook. I used djangosocialauth for the same. I have integrated it successfully with my test project. However, I am clueless as to how to map a user to a django auth user. To be more precise, say for example, that I authenticate a user via facebook. After the session is over, the user logs out. When the user returns for the second time, again via facebook, how do I know that it is the same user I cannot use the facebook username because the username can be changed I cannot use the users email ID for obvious reasons. What identifier from the data sent by facebook, should I consider unique for a particular user The keys from the response sent by facebook is as followsp  pcode[username, bio, firstname, lastname, verified, name, locale, hometown, work, expires, sports, languages, quotes, link, location, gender, accesstoken, timezone, education, updatedtime, id]codep  pThough, the answer most obvious to me is to use id to identify the user, what are the chances that facebook move all their data to new servers, and the id field associated with users change If that happens, it might cause a user with a changed id to access another users data if he gets the same id as the latters previous id I can probably use a combination of id and username, since facebook allows you to change the username, only once. But if they remove this restriction, it would break my logic. I am completely new to OAuth2, so please forgive my ignorance if this sounds silly. I tried to research a bit, but got lost in the huge tutorials How do people generally handle this p  pEDIT The answers to the question linked as duplicate does not answer my question on how to deal with the ID changing at facebook side. Though it is a rare case, the possibility cannot be ruled out, especially because the change will happen at facebook side, and I would have no control over it. Moreover, I would not even have any intimation when it changes. And if such a thing happens, the security of users of my app would be at stake Since OAuth2 is kind of a standard, is there any guideline on the unique identifier Does any guideline prevent a provider from changing the user IDp

Negative 1820 pIm currently developing a website where I need a widget to display the upcoming match. The site is for a football team. Ive therefore created a plugin which creates a custom post type and a widget. Everything is working really well, but as I dont like to clutter my PHP code with HTML I figured Id include the widget settings in from another file in the plugin directory. Although the include returns booltrue nothing is showing in the widget form.p  pHere is the code Im using to include the filep  precodepublic function forminstance     requireoncethisgtplugindirectory.viewswidgetform.php  codepre  pThe variable thisplugin directory is defined in the constructor and points to the correct path.p  pHere is the html code inside the included file, its brief but just to test. No matter what I type in there it keeps returning blank.p  precodeltinput typetext nametitle valueHello World gt codepre  pAny ideas why this keeps happening, or doesnt WordPress support loading extra files in places like this I could just have my html in the pluginfile, but I prefer to keep PHP clean, and not cluttered with HTML andor CSS, JS etc.p  pemIf anyone could help me figure this out I would greatly appreciate it emp  pThanks in advance, Jonathanp

Negative 1820 pIm having issues using the RSS feed splitter in Mule to split RSS feeds from some websites into individual SyndEntry objects. I have included xml code from my Mule application. I have also included the logs of 3 different instances of running my Mule application on 3 different feeds  the first works and the next two gives errors . Dont worry about the output of the first feed on the bottom, but I have included it there to show that some feeds can indeed be turned splitted into SyndEntry objects, and subsequently elements can be extracted from those objects  by my EntryReceiver class defined in my Mule application . Yet, for most of the other feeds that I try to split, I end up getting the same errors. Please help me if you can. p  pNote I also included a snippet of the EntryReceiver class at the end whose function takes in a SyndEntry object, yet the feeds that give errors never enter the function in the first place.p  pMule Application Code...p  precode lthttppollingconnector namePollingHttpConnector pollingFrequency60000 docnameHTTP Polling clientSoTimeout10000 cookieSpecnetscape  receiveBacklog0 receiveBufferSize0 sendBufferSize0 serverSoTimeout10000 socketSoLinger0 validateConnectionstruegt     ltflow namemyFlow docnamemyFlowgt         lthttpinboundendpoint exchangepatternoneway   docnameHTTP addresshttpwww.nasa.govrssdynbreakingnews.rss connectorrefPollingHttpConnectorgt         ltrssfeedsplittergt         ltrssentrylastupdatedfiltergt         ltcomponent classpath.to.EntryReceiver docnameJavagt         ltlogger message[payload] levelINFO docnameLoggergt         lthttpoutboundendpoint exchangepatternrequestresponse hostmy.host portmy.port pathapiv1activity methodPOST mimeTypeapplicationjson docnameHTTPgt         ltlogger message[payload] levelINFO docnameLoggergt     ltflowgt codepre  pRossMason Feed WORKING... from a hrefhttprossmason.blogspot.comfeedspostsdefault relnofollowhttprossmason.blogspot.comfeedspostsdefaultap  precodeorg.mule.DefaultMuleMessage    id279b9b1ae97911e2ba080d15b2b474eb   payloadorg.mule.transport.http.ReleasingInputStream   correlationIdltnot setgt   correlationGroup1   correlationSeq1   encodingUTF8   exceptionPayloadltnot setgt  Message properties   INVOCATION scoped properties   INBOUND scoped properties     CacheControlprivate, maxage0     Connectionfalse     ContentTypeapplicationatomxml charsetUTF8     DateWed, 10 Jul 2013 155533 GMT     ETagWCUUBQXs6cCl7ImA9WhJbFkQ.

Negative 1820 pI am creating a link that changes text when it is clicked.  I want the link text to change back to the original text after all the processing is complete.

By putting codeoncode event into a separate function, will this cause issues.  Please, any help will be appreciated.  Thanks.p

Negative 1820 pI would really like to run my Win7 ipython interactively inside a proper terminal and shell provided by cygwin mintty or rxvt would be great.p  pI have had some success with python, but IPython is not really cooperating. If we run this from rxvt bash promptp  precode cygdrivecpydirpython.exe i codepre  pI end up with a fairly successful python interactive session. But vanilla python is just not as wonderful as IPython. So then I try thisp  precode cygdrivecpydiripython.exe codepre  pand the program just blocks the bash prompt, and seems to spawn an entirely separate process which does not produce any windows, or show signs of stdinstdout.p  pIf instead I use thisp  precode cygdrivecpydirpython.exe i cygdrivecpydiripythonscript.py codepre  pit is exciting at first, but you quickly realize that ipython is not properly engaging with the terminal. There is no readline support, poor cursor control, stdin seems to handle typical python, but there are no [out] prompts although prints do spit out text, simple things like backspaceentertab seem completely broken the cursor is very defiant, there is nothing like an ncurse buffer being maintained you can just type over the ipy command prompts. Once I have given up on the session, exiting becomes another problem. I can return to the bash prompt, but I have no standard input. It turns out that there is always a python.exe process hanging that must be killed from the Windows side and it doesnt release stdin until it dies.p  pIs there a quick fix or alternate method to run Ipython in this manner I can do most of my development using the cygwin binaries, but being able to run win32 binaries interactive would help tremendously when debuggingtesting win32 specific python libraries.p  hr  pP.S.

Why is that so Whats the workaroundp  pstrongEditstrongp  pRegarding Nicos answerp  pemRectangularDrawingObjects ToXMLInternal is still valid when accessing Rectangle from the outside.emp  pThis is not correct. ToXMLInternal isntshouldnt be availble when accessing codeRectanglecode from the outside because it is Protected at best.p  pemIf you call ToXMLInternal from inside Rectangle, it is different. Then the caller knows that there is a shadowing method and uses this instead of RectangularDrawingObjects method.emp  pRectangularDrawingObjects method emisem the shadowing method. What does this passage mean thenp  pAnd if I understand your point correctly, then there is no possible situation in which codePrivate Shadowscode would ever work or be required. Yes VS should then warn about it saying Private and Shadows cannot be combined, like it does for many other keywords e.g. codePrivatecode and codeOverridablecode.p

Negative 1820 pIm debugging a WCF Service that hosted in IIS 6 with VS 2008.  To do so, I just attach to the w3wp.exe process, and Im good to go.p  pHowever, its quite annoying that this process seems to be killed all the time, like every time I stop debugging, or if I stop actively using the service for a few minutes.  That means almost every time I invoke a service method and want to debug, I have to keep repeatedly attaching to the process.p  pIs there any way to easily keep the process alive, or maybe get the debugger to automatically attach to it when it gets startedp  pIm thinking theres probably some IIS config that might help here, but I cant find it.p  pI know I can write a console app to host in just for debugging, but Id rather not have to do that.p

Negative 1820 pThe goalp  pWrite a function that takes two parameters 1 a String representing a text document and 2 an integer providing the number of items to return. Implement the function such that it returns a list of Strings ordered by word frequency, the most frequently occurring word first.  Use your best judgement to decide how words are separated. Your solution should run in On time where n is the number of characters in the document.p  pMy thoughts were that, in the worst case, the input to the function could be the total number of words in the document, reducing the problem to sorting the words by their frequencies.  This made me think that the lower bound for time complexity would be On log n if I used a comparison sorting method.  So, my thought was that the best approach was to implement a counting sort.  Here is my code.  I would like for you to tell me whether my analysis is correct, Ive annotated the code with my idea of what the time complexity is, but it could definitely be incorrect. What is the actual time and space complexity of this code  Also I would like to hear if this is in fact a good approach, if there are any alternate approaches that would be used in practice.  p  precode n is number of characters in string, k is number of words  def wordfrequenciesstring, n   words  string.splits   On   max  0   min  FloatINFINITY   frequencies  words.injectHash.new0 do hash,word   Ok     occurrences  hash[word]  1                      O1     max  occurrences if occurrences gt max             O1     min  occurrences if occurrences lt min             O1     hash                                              O1     end     perform a counting sort    sorted  Array.newmax  words.length    delta  0    frequencies.each do word, frequency   Ok     p word    frequency.tos     index  frequency     if sorted[index]       sorted[index]  sorted[index].pushword    I think O1.     else       sorted[index]  [word]                     O1     end   end    return sorted.compact.flatten[n..1].reverse       Compact is Ok.

Negative 1820 pIm having trouble running a Cocoa app on 10.7 even though it seems like Im taking the correct steps.  Heres a description of what Im doing and what seems to be wrongp  pIm building on a 10.8 machine with XCode 5.0.2 and SDK 10.9 with a deployment target of 10.7.  One of my dynamic libraries uses some CoreGraphics functions, so I linked that library against ApplicationServices.framework. From what I understand, prior to 10.8, CoreGraphics was included within ApplicationServices, so I cant link against CoreGraphics directly or Ill have problems.p  pAfter building, my library that uses CoreGraphics has references directly to CoreGraphics.framework at SystemLibraryFrameworksCoreGraphics.frameworkVersionsACoreGraphics, but that path doesnt exist on 10.7.  When I run the application on 10.8, it works fine, but on 10.7, it blows up trying to load that framework that doesnt exist.p  pMy hacky Solutionp  pAfter banging my head against this for a while, I decided to go nuclear and add a new Build Phase to change the CoreGraphics reference in my library to a path that is compatible with 10.7, beneath ApplicationServices.framework.  My script does the followingp  pinstallnametool change SystemLibraryFrameworksCoreGraphics.frameworkVersionsACoreGraphics SystemLibraryFrameworksApplicationServices.frameworkFrameworksCoreGraphics.frameworkVersionsACoreGraphics myLibrary.dylibp  pThis works, but it seems like a silly hack.  Has anyone else seen thisp

Negative 1820 pAlright so Im taking an AP Computer Science course and up until now Ive found the content easy and unchallenging because I already had a background in Java. However now I have run into an issue with some of the code that the course is providing me with and writing a function based off of it. Ive googled it, and tested many different things to try and get it to work and to no avail. So hopefully you guys can shed some light on this and perhaps help me figure it out.p  pFirst the book provides me with this code as a basic Time classp  precodepublic class Time extends Object            private int itsHour           private int itsMin           Create an object for the given hour and minute. If min            is negative, adjust the values to make 0 lt min lt 60.      public Time int hour, int min   constructor         super       itsHour  hour       for itsMin  min itsMin lt 0 itsMin  itsMin  60             itsHour              Return the time expressed in military time.    public String toString           if itsHour lt 10               return 0  itsHour  itsMin          else               return   itsHour  itsMin                 Return the result of adding this Time to that Time.       public Time add Time that            Read below at issue 2         codepre  pThat was the main class they gave us to work with and then they gave a class called TimeTester which is to be used to execute the commands. The comments dictate what should happen.p  precodeimport javax.swing.JOptionPane   class TimeTester         public static void main String[] args               Time t1  new Time 13, 25              Time t2  new Time 8, 150              JOptionPane.showMessageDialog null, 1   t1.toString              JOptionPane.showMessageDialog null, 2   t2.toString              Time t3  t1.add t2              JOptionPane.showMessageDialog null, 3   t3.toString              t1  t2.add t3              JOptionPane.showMessageDialog null, 1   t1.toString              System.exit 0              codepre  pNow like I said this code was literally handed to me its making sense of the code and getting it to work for me that I just literally cannot do. So below are basically the key issues Im running into.p  p1 I understand how its supposed to run and what the executors do, but I do not understand what exactly its doing to achieve the results.p  p2 The add function in the first set of code which was basically its main class is the main part of the assignment. The assignment reads as followsp  blockquote   pExercise 4.15 harder Write the Time method public Time add Time   that  The executor returns a new Time object that is the sum of the   two, e.g., 0740 add 1430 is    2210. If the sum is more than 2359, drop the extra 24 hours, e.g., 1300 add 1400 is 300.   Assigned from a hrefhttpwww.cs.ccsu.edujoneschap04.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.cs.ccsu.edujoneschap04.pdfap blockquote  pWhen I carry over the values to the add function in the TimeTester executing now.addwait I go to pull that result using that but the values dont pull forward. p  pIve also tried to change up the functions to perhaps get my own understanding and make it work for me. I changed the Time later call in the TimeTester, and then edited the function add to accept 2 values. Then added this code to the add functionp  precodepublic Time add Time time1, Time time2          String t1String  time1.toString  Value is 0730         String t2String  time2.toString  Value is 0245         int t1convert  Integer.parseIntt1String, 2  Value is 730         int t2convert  Integer.parseIntt2String, 2  Value is 245         int total  t1convert  t2convert  Value added together is 1015         return total  Return value of total      codepre  pSo my call looked like this p  precodepublic static void main String[] args          now  new Time 7, 30  730 in the morning          wait  new Time 2, 45  2 hours 45 minutes          later  now.add now, wait  produces 1015 in the morning          JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, now      wait      later.toString         System.exit 0        codepre  pHowever all that code would not compile and produce a result which could be returned to my codeTimeTestercode, it always produced a compile error of incompatible types referring to my return total line. So it obviously cannot return Integers. So I am just absolutely stuck on what to do to make it add the two times.p  p3 I cannot use the built in Java time functions where its formatted with semicolons. I know how to do that part which is why this different way is driving me up the wall.p  p4 I dont want you to write my code for me, Id like to gain a better understanding of it and perhaps have my mistakes pointed out so that I can comprehend what in the world is going on with it.p  pI know its a long post, but when I ask for help I like to be descriptive and provide everything I can because I know its going to help me better in the long run and hopefully help the person who helps me track down an answer fast. p  pPS. All of this is compiled and ran in a program called BlueJ. Its an online course so I have no instructor in class to ask about it all we have is a monitor.p

Negative 1820 pDuring the early days of windows mobile phones, pre exchange server capabilities on mobile devices, and before gmail became what it is today there was an app which for the life of me I can not remember the name. It provided PUSH notifications for email users by sending an sms to the device, which their application intercepted before it went to the messaging app, this sms was composed of a certain line of code that told the email software on the phone to poll the email server for new email. Of course this software also stopped the sms from actually reaching the text messaging application so as not to confuse the user. p  pNow let me put this into context. I am trying to create a note taking app for android devices that will allow one person to create a note that will then be automatically synced with other selected devices, such as family members, certain coworkers etc. I want this to sync automatically, and quietly, and the prerequisite is that I do not want to have to set up a central server to handle the passthrough. p  pI had thought back to the app from the early 2000s that I spoke of a moment ago, in thoughts that the user could just add certain contacts and their numbers into a group, write a note, then the application would send an SMS to each of the contacts that would be intercepted by the note app on their phones due to the specific header in the SMS. The message would be blocked from reaching the messaging app. But would then initiate a file transfer in the background from the initiator to all of the client phones. p  pThis is a circumstance that Ive found very hard to search for. p  pIs there any known api that could facilitate this  Or do any of you know a better method Will Google cloud messaging allow this to happenp  pThe file itself could be theoretically sent in the message, or the message could initiate a P2P connection.

Negative 1820 pLet me explain what I mean. On medium screens, the top navigation bar would look like thisp  precode Logo                            10  Settings Account Home  codepre  pWhere 10 is the number of notifications and is a bascially a dropdown menu that shows recent notifications when clicked on.p  pOn small screens, I want the menu to be like thisp  precode Logo   10    codepre  pin which  is the collapse button which showsbr Settings Account Home when clicked on, and 10 has the same role as before.p  pAs far as I have learned from bootstrap examples, ALL of 10  Settings Account Home will go inside the collapse button. One solution I can think of is having two separate notification buttons and showhide them using the media queries. But in this case, I should also have two separate menus containing recent notifications which doesnt seem smart to me. I appreciate it if you can give me any ideas to achieve what Im looking for. p
Negative 1820 pI have been experimenting with Web API 2 for the past couple of weeks and Im trying to figure out the best way to handle a particular scenario during partial updates.p  pThe API will allow the user to do partial updates via POST. By design, any properties that are not supplied in the request body are assumed to be unchanged and no changes will be made to those properties.p  pThe challenge, however, is trying to determine when a user has explicitly set a property value to null. When the request body is pulled in via the controller, any absent properties are set as null automatically as the JSON request body is deserialized. As such, I lose my ability to determine if the property value is null explicitly i.e. the user is trying to set the property value as null, in which case I want to update the property to null or if the property value is null implicitly i.e. the property value was set to null during deserilaization, in which case I want to ignore it.p  pI am looking for any ideas of how I might approach this situation.p

Negative 1820 pI have a question related to design pattern. Suppose now I want to analyze the input data in different ways. I guess that a pretty idea should be that different methods can be regarded as different classes. As those methods share something in common when it comes to the processing chain. For example, each method will read the data from the media first, and then do some kind of normalization. After the analysis is finished, the result should be written to a file. Therefore, when I design the class for different process method, I firstly design a base class for all the methodsp  precodeclass Base   private    void readdata    void normalizedata    virtual void writedata0    virtual void processdata0  public     bool runthemethod        readdata     normalizedata     processdata     writedata          codepre  pFor the method class, what I should do is to redefine the virtual function codeprocessdatacode and codewritedatacode. Now my only concern is the output of the analysis after performing each method. Although the input of the method is the same regardless of the method, the output of the method may be different. For some methods, their output are images for some methods, their output are vectors, which can be stored in a text file. This will affect the arguments in the function codeprocessdatacode as well as the codewritedatacode function.  What I can think of is to derive several classes based on the codeBasecode class. p  precode  class OutputImagepublic Base            pulbic         OutputImageBase         virtual void writedata   writing images to file         virtual void processdata  0          class OutputTextpublic Base            pulbic         OutputImageBase         virtual void writedata   writing text to file         virtual void processdata  0      codepre  pThe basic idea is that depending on the output format of the processing method, all the methods can be further derived from codeOutputImagecode class or codeOutputTextcode class. For examplep  precodeclass ProcessMethodpublic  OutputText    public     virtual void processdata             codepre  pNow my question is is it a right class design strategy are there smart ways of defining different processing method in a hierarchy class structure Thanks. p

Negative 1820 pIve run across a VB threading and WPF display problem that has me baffled. Im new to threading as well as to StackOverflow, but the thing is that my code executes exactly as expected the problem is that the WPF controls it affects arent updated right. Ive scoured the Internet for potential fixes but am still coming up emptyhanded. p  pIm trying to update a crude SplashScreenWindow in the Initialized sub of my MainWindow. Theres quite a bit of initialization code  most of which Ive commented out here  so I want to let the user know what loading phase theyre in and provide a ProgressBar as a visual aid. The simple WPF code for these controls and the SplashScreenWindow appear at the end of this code sample, while the splash screen itself is referenced at Application scope. In the Initialized sub I make several synchronous calls to the splash screens Dispatcher.Invoke method, which is handled by the UpdateSplashScreenWindow delegate in the Application class. Some of these calls are made in the constructor of a TableClass class, which handles the creation of several dozen data classes one at a time, as directed in some code Ive commented out.p  pI can verify at any breakpoint that the values of the ProgressBar and LoadingTextBox are updated exactly as I directed them to be. On the other hand, the display of the controls is normally updated just one time, after the first call to Dispatcher.Invoke what I usually see is the SplashScreen frozen with a text message saying Initializing Dataset and a ProgressBar thats only moved a smidge. Then there are no further updates until the Initialized code is done, the MainWindow opens and the SplashScreenWindow is disposed of. Yet if an error is caught in the TryCatch, the progress bar and textbox will suddenly display the correct values. I can set breakpoints anywhere in the code  even in the WindowLoadingProgressBarValueChanged event in the SplashScreenWindow  and verify that at no point are the Text and Value properties set incorrectly. It gets even weirder though. As you can see in the UpdateSplashScreenWindow, I add the letter s to the title of the SplashScreenWindow at each pass, as a visual test. I see the title scrolling to the right across the top of the screen as expected, but the child controls below it are only updated once, although both are in the very same routine.  p  pCalling InvalidateMeasure, InvalidateVisual and UpdateLayout on either the controls or their parent window are among the workarounds that have no effect. I dont think its a threading problem, because the splash screen thread executes synchronously, as expected. Those seem to be the usual culprits in other references to WPF visual updating problems Ive seen on the Web, but I think Ive ruled them out. If anyone has any ideas, Id appreciate some input.  Im not too worried right now about tangential issues like whether the referencing the splash screen at Application scope is good design practice or not, or investigating other means of threading WPF windows, like BackgroundWorker. After getting this far and finally getting my code to work in theory, Id like to figure out whatevers preventing it from displaying right in practice, in case I or anyone else ever runs into the issue again.

codepre  pSo as you can see, I have it set up so that it tells me the average number of collisions that occurred when constructing this particular hash table. There are 30 numbers and 30 spaces for them to occupy. I tried changing the parameter for the amount of available spaces from 30 to 60, but that didnt change anything, and I want to figure out how to fix this.p  pThis is important to me because I want to take this code up a notch. I would like to try this program out for a larger set of numbers, maybe a thousand or more, but I dont want to just manually input a thousand more string numbers. How would I write a loop that would do this for me For example, if I put 1000 in its parameter, it will produce a thousand numbers in string notation as seen in the code that will be used.p  pI also want to make it so that I can have multiple of these string numbers run in a single program execution. For example, the hash table can hold 1000 numbers, so then it will run the program with 1 number, then 2,3, etc... until it has done so all the way up to 1000. And for each time it does this, I want it to output the average number of collisions that occurred in that particular run. With only 1 number there will be no collision, and eventually collisions will occur as the amount of numbers increases.p  pBy doing this, I could then make a graph that shows how the amount of collisions changes as the ratio of numbers to available spots changes.

Negative 1820 pI have a table, with a lot of  elements. It is a calendar with events, and every event has its own ID number, as well as one of three different categories, lets call them A, B and C.p  pNow for styling reasons, the categories are also implemented CSSclasses, which has the same names.p  pI ahve searched a bit on how to implement a rightclicklistener with javascriptJQuery. I tried a couple of different solutions, before setteling on a override of the contextmenufunction, that the right button usually fires. I have also been able to differ between the categories, by passing parameters, that the contextmenu should only be overridden when elements of A, B and C are clicked. The following code works perfectlyp  precodedocument.oncontextmenu, .A, .B, functione      .colorboxwidth554px, height480px, iframetrue, hrefmyurl                     return false                   document.oncontextmenu, .C, functione      .colorboxhrefmyurl                     return false                    codepre  pThe colorbox, if not familiar with it, is just a popup, implemented as an editor of my calendarevents. However I wish to pass on the source of the clicks identification number, and I have not been able to find out how. These IDs are unique.p  pSop  ol liCan I pass parameters through this functionli liIf so, howli liIf not, or if this overriding contextmenu is a bad way of doing it, how should it be doneli ol  pIf any relevance at all, this is a part of a Java web app. I am using jstl and jsp when coding.p  pThank you.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  phere are two functions. The top is a changelistener I use on some checkboxes, and they work. The bottom is the overridden contextmenu, but it does not work. Somehow it seems that the function breaks out of the parent function, and ignores everything after. The return statement does not work, and the contextmenu appears.p  precodedocument.ready     function          .toggle.changefunction          var id  this.value         .  id.togglethis.checked        document.ready     function         .A, .B.contextmenufunction              var id  this.Attrclass             alertid             return false               codepre  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pIn other words, I just solved my own problem. Even so, I only kinda answered my own question. I have figured out how to pass at least a single parameter, but it still need to be one of the set parameters of a given htmlelement, this time, the . I set my desired identification number, as the elements id, and retrieved the value like thisp  precodedocument.ready function     .A, .B.contextmenufunction          var id  this.id         alertid         return false       codepre  pStill, I feel this is a clunky way of implementing a onrightclicklistener, especially when compared to how I am used to do it in SWING.

Negative 1820 pI am writing a loop to build up and insert random strings with 5 characters. In testing which approach is fasted for building up these string I have run into inconsistent results that hopefully someone can explain to me.p  pThe three approaches I am comparing are setting up a table variable with all possible random numbers and the characters that match them, a case statement that looks at random number and decides what character to return based on a formula, and a case statement that has all possible random numbers and the characters that match them.p  pWhere I am getting stuck is the last approach. If I build a case statement with rand output as value and a whenthen statement for all 62 possible characters I often get a NULL result, however if I put the rand value in a variable first and then use the variable as the case value then it never comes back with NULL. If I select the rand output it is never outside the 061 range but if I put in an else statement then that is getting hit.

Negative 1820 pI have a website built on the Ushahidi platform that uses the Kohana framework. Currently the site runs on Kohana 2.x.p  pI would like to grab the report title for each report page on my website. The website in question is a number of report pages.p  pIm new to code in general and this is my first time coming across a MVC framework. It sounds good though, as far as I can interpret one can pull info out of the db without writing a sql query but rather by calling it within the view itself. Rightp  pThe documentation gives some examples of using Kohana to grab info out of the DB here a hrefhttpswiki.ushahidi.comdisplayWIKIDatabaseaccess relnofollowhttpswiki.ushahidi.comdisplayWIKIDatabaseaccessap  pHeres one of the examples I tried that outputs the expected data  codereportcount  ORMfactoryincidentgtcountallcodep  pSo, as someone new to this, I wanted to use that snippet of code as a base and edit it to get what I need for my current task. The website in question is a series of reports and for each report page I would like to add the report title to a meta description tag in the head.p  pHere is the code that outputs the report title further down the DOM on a report pagep  precodelth1 classreporttitlegtltphp echo htmlescapeincidenttitle codepre  pI cannot find the escape function anywhere to refer to and, since Im adding this meta tag via  a plugin, the function that generates the meta tag exists on a separate script.

I know this after experimenting with the followingp  precodeincititle  ORMfactoryincidentgttablecolumnincidentid echo incititle codepre  pThis gave the error message Invalid method tablecolumn called in IncidentModelp  pThen I triedp  precodeincititle  ORMfactoryincident gtwhereincidenttitle, incidentgtfind echo incititle codepre  pThis just returned the number 10.

Negative 1820 pI feel like having lost my OO knowledge. Actually, the problem looks simple I want to create a class which operates on an object whichp  ul liinherits from System.Windows.Forms.Formli liimplements the interface IDescribedActionsProviderli ul  pat the same time.p  pI could create a new Form type public abstract class SpecialForm  Form, IDescribedActionsProvider and require a parameter of that SpecialForm type.p  pBut it does not work here most of our Forms inherit from OurCompanyForm which need not implement IDescribedActionsProvider, and some of our forms do not inherit therefrom, but when they implement the interface, they should be an acceptable parameter. It is emcompositionem what is required here, not eminheritanceem.p  pThen I thought of Generics. I could define my class likep  precodepublic class FormControllerltTgt  IDisposable where T  Form, IDescribedActionsProvider  T ControlledForm OtherType OtherObject  internal FormControllerOtherType otherObject, T controlledForm      OtherObject  otherObject     ControlledForm  controlledForm     ....  codepre  pIt would work the way I intended, but it feels totally wrong Thats not what Generics see MSDN at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysz6zd40f28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysz6zd40f28vvs.10029.aspxa were meant for. And I get problems when I want to create that FormController object in a Factory because of the OtherType which is created there which is not generic, i.e. a function like public FormController CreateFormcontrollerT controlledForm is not possible because T not defined here... And using SpecialForm instead of T does not work because of composition vs. inheritance.p  pWhat do you suggest Duck Typing  but thats not a good OO practise eitherp  pEditsp  pThe object to be passed to FormController must be of both types, because it describes to events of Form and calls methods of the interface. p  pDefining T in the factory method as described in Boris B.s comment and Weyland Yutanis answer works. p  pBut still I have doubts about the use of Generics in this context The T controlledForm parameter is a single object, there is exactly only one instance of that type in the FormController class, and nowhere does the concrete type matter  thats clearly different from e.g. a Listltintgt. I do not need a FormController object, just a FormController which happens to work on that form.p

Negative 1820 pI am fairly new to Ruby on Rails, have only been using it for 6 months.  Previously I worked primarily in .NET, and have architected some large web applications using that framework.  I have been a proponent of code generation for some time, which is part of what attracted me to RoR for my next application. p  pIn the .NET world, I had a lot of success using generated code, inheritance and partial classes to more easily enable refactoring, enhancements and maintenance of generated code.  Essentially, within each layer of the applications, generators were used to create base classes with core functionality.  Those base classes could then be subclassed to extend or modify the behavior as necessary to address the needs of each specific component.  p  pOver time, however, we often needed to make changes to the generated code without overwriting the handwritten extension code.  In a .NET world, that was quite manageable using partial classes to implement the subclass extensionsoverrides, keeping the generated code files separate from the extension code files.p  pI am now trying to decide how to best accomplish the same thing in an RoR world, and am hoping for some guidance from those of you that may tried similar approaches.  I have not found anything analogous to partial classes in ruby, but maybe there is a different mechanism to accomplish the same thing.p  pBelow is a quick example of how I typically organized code in a .NET world p  pgeneratedBaseEmployee.csp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic abstract class BaseEmployee    public BaseEmployeestring name, decimal salary        this.Name  name     this.Salary  salary      public string Name  get protected set    public decimal Salary  get protected set    public virtual void GiveRaisedecimal amount        if this.AuthorizeRaiseamount this.Salary  amount      protected virtual AuthorizeRaisedecimal amount        if amount gt this.Salary  0.1  no raises over 10       return false     else       return true     codepre  pgeneratedEmployee.csp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic partial class Employee  BaseEmployee    public Employeestring name, decimal salary  basename, salary    codepre  pextensionsEmployee.csp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepartial class Employee    public Employeestring name, string title, decimal salary       basename, title, salary     protected override AuthorizeRaisedecimal amount        if this.Name  Mr. Dithers   this clown gets no raise       return false     else       return base.AuthorizeRaiseamount     codepre

This is not the efficient way to code this, but Im a beginner so I did what I had to make it work for a demo.p  pEach comment in my table already contains a column and a row field, so I would like to actually translate that directly into the grid. To explain further each grid square could have more than one comment. so the records could look like thisp  pcodeTable fields title  author  email  row  col Record 0    TitleA    AuthorA  EmailA    0    0  Record 1    TitleB    AuthorB  EmailB    1    0  Record 2    TitleC    AuthorC  EmailC    0    1  Record 3    TitleD    AuthorA  EmailA    1    1  Record 4    TitleE    AuthorB  EmailB    0    0code p  pHence Record 0 and Record 4 are both in grid square 0,0.  Im now trying to move to a loop and a 3D array to make it work. I would like to be able to create the 3D array such that my echo command would be something like output[0][0][title] for the title field for col0row0, output[1][0][author] for the col1row0.p  pIm also moving away from mysql and replacing it with mysqli.PDO is a bit too advanced for me, but if people think that PDO has the best solution, I guess I can learn from your responses.p  pFor example, can I create a loop where the SQL result is stored as an array egp  precodeforx0xltnumberSidesx      for y0yltnumberRowsy                  queryString[x][y]  SELECT  from comments WHERE topicid  1 AND col  x AND row  y          sqlResult[x][y]  mysqliqueryconnection, queryString[x][y]         resultArray[x][y]  mysqlifetchassocsqlResult[x][y]        codepre  pWould that work Is there an elegant way to achieve what I am hoping to do I appreciate any guidance on this.

Negative 1820 pIs it possible to render a Android layout created by native java code into a HTML div using Phonegap I know about the plugin concepts, but I dontn know how to pass the layout to the webview to render it per javascript into one div.p  pAll I found until now is how to shrink the Phonegap webview layout and add an additional layout. Then the both layouts are shown at the same time, but I would like to display the additional layout in the webview layout and control its position per javascript or css.p  pTo render a specific view will also be sufficient, not the whole layout.p

Negative 1820 pThis question is more about math than programming. I am programming a function which takes a square of geographical distance between 2 points with known latitude and longitude as an argument. Theres a straightforward way to compute it calculate dotproduct, then take arccos, and multiply by Earth radius. Then square the result and you get the square of geographical distance assuming Earth is a sphere which is acceptable approximation in my case.p  pHowever I would like, if possible, to avoid an expensive arccos call, especially given that I can easily obtain the square of the tunnel distance by either Pythagorean theorem or the dot product. p  pI also read here a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGeographicaldistanceTunneldistance relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGeographicaldistanceTunneldistancea about underestimation formula which I can use to get tunnel distance from geographical distance. In my case however, I need the opposite tunnel to geographical, and for the square. I played with Taylor series and got a rough approximationp  pG square   T2  1  T2R212.0  here G2 is square of geographical distance, T2square of tunnel, R2square of Earth radius. I also was able to get a more accurate formulap  pG square  T2  1  T2R212.0  T2R22240.0.p  pThis last formula gives error of only 3.8mm for G1000 km, and less than 50cm for G2000 km.p  pHowever, I still cannot mathematically prove this formula, at least when using Taylor series. Wonder if its possible to get the mathematical proof and also expansion of this formula for larger values of GT. Thanks p

It looks for all pay values from the 11th to the 10th and sums it as a total. It also gives me the values for the previous month 11072014 to 10082014. The output view looks something like thisp  prePeriodStart    total 20140711     180       Previous month 20140811     45        This monthpre  pPrevious month being 11072014  10082014 This month being 11082014  10092014p  pWhat I need is for the above code to be rewritten to give me 4 separate variables. As an example  the variable names could be  previousmonth, ptotal, thismonth, ttotal these 4 variables can then be used in my classic asp coding.p  pIf its easier splitting the above SQL Statement into 2 separate statements this will be ok.p  pIm trying to get away from using an array in my Classic ASP code as this is throwing errors when I have a new user. I would also find it easier to play with variables than I would with an array.p

What my book of stupid doesnt tell is is there some reason or case where the alternative way will not work or why its almost never used To my head if variable is at the beginning of a program given a value, it would be easier to read the code syntax using alternative syntax.p  pO please wise and mighty SO members, enlighten me please  when would I use or should I use the alternative way at allp

Negative 1820 pI am having an issue. I have two separate databases, one for films and one for followers.

So currently I can say.p  precode    following  FollowwhereuserId, , usergtidgtorderBycreatedat, DESCgtget codepre  pAnd that will return me all of the things a user is following.

However, this is obviously local to just script1, and not a shared dict between the 3 scripts... And I very much doubt the listeners started in script2 and script3 are actually as attached to the reactor started in script1 as netstat  ps might suggest  and as such probably not useable listeners...p  pSo the yes no question  is it even possible to do what I am trying to do with multiple python scripts, and if so, can anyone offer a suggestion on how I can achieve this p  pMany Thanksp

For the fields that are enums, I create another DataTable with those values and put all of these tables into a data set for a single message.  Below is my working code to do thisp  precodedef makeMessageTablesself, messageType           Instance variable for the message DataSet         self.messageDataSet  DataSet                    Create a table in the DataSet to hold the message structure.                  messageTable  DataTable          messageTable.TableName  messageTable           Construct columns in the table to correspons with the message fields.         messageFields  messageType.DESCRIPTOR.fields         for field in messageFields             messageTable.Columns.Addfield.name           Add the table to the DataSet         self.messageDataSet.Tables.AddmessageTable                    Make a table for each field that has an enum type associated          with it.  The table has the display values and the storage           values in it foe setting up the ComboBox in the DataGridView                  for field in messageFields             if field.enumtype  None                 tableName  enumTable.formatfield.enumtype.name                 enumTable  DataTable                 enumTable.TableName  tableName                 enumTable.Columns.AddenumDisplay                 enumTable.Columns.AddenumValue                  for value in field.enumtype.values                     newRow  enumTable.NewRow                     newRow[enumDisplay]  value.name                     newRow[enumValue]  value.number                     enumTable.Rows.AddnewRow                  self.messageDataSet.Tables.AddenumTable codepre  pNow, today I hit a message that has submessages.  I want a separate table for each of the submessages.  The problem I am having is that I do not know how to break down the message to get the fields names and other information from the submessages.  I have provided a representative sample message like I am trying to deal with below.p  precodemessage SystemOneStatusDetails      required int32 field1  1         required int32 field1  1         required int32 field1  1         required int32 field1  1   message SystemTwoStatusDetails      required int32 field1  1         required int32 field1  1         required int32 field1  1         required int32 field1  1   message StatusMessage      repeated SystemOneStatusDetails sysOneStatus  1                 repeated SystemTwoStatusDetails sysTwoStatus  2             codepre  pI am using IronPython 2.7 inside Visual Studio.p  pIf anyone could lead me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it.p  pThanks, Robert Hixp
Negative 1820 pI have a model Tag, which is a tree model using a hrefhttpsgithub.commceachenclosuretree relnofollowcodeclosuretreecodea and thanks to the gem I can do stuff likep  precodeTag.includeschildren.first codepre  pto eager load its children. Now, I have an instance method, which also uses children. So when I get a tag by the mentioned query, iterate over the tag and its children and call this instance method, the a hrefhttpsgithub.comflyerhzmbullet relnofollowcodebulletcodea gem complains that I am doing a N1 queries and advises me to codeincludechildrencode. This happens because I have not loaded the children of the children, so when calling the instance method, I make a separate query for the children of each subtag of the firstlevel tag.p  pI can solve this by doing the followingp  precodeTag.includeschildren children.first codepre  pIn this case ActiveRecord eagerly loads the tag, its children and the children of its children. This, however, works if there are only 3 generations  the tag is a grandparent and then come the parents which are children of the root tag and the grandchildren which are the children of the children of the root tag. If I have, say, 4 generations, than I must dop  precodeTag.includeschildren children children.first codepre  pSo if I can determine the codedepthcode of the farthest grand child of a root tag, is there a way to conditionally construct my query  if depth is 2, use codeincludeschildrencode, if depth is 3  use codeincludeschildren childrencode and so onp
Negative 1820 pI am currently using codeDjango1.7.1code. I have some reusable apps with same module name. This also makes app labels of models same. This is actually conflicting. You cant use both module with same name in different libraries, in your codeINSTALLEDAPPScode in your codesettingscode file. p  pI solved this by adding an codeAppConfigcode for the modules and changed their labelsapplabel to resolve conflictionp  precodelibrarayX.mymodule.apps.py from django.apps import AppConfig   class ModuleAppConfigAppConfig     name  libraryX.mymodule     label  Xmymodule     verbosename  mymodule    librarayY.mymodule.apps.py from django.apps import AppConfig   class ModuleAppConfigAppConfig     name  libraryY.mymodule     label  Ymymodule     verbosename  mymodule   settings.py  .... INSTALLEDAPPS[     ...    libraryX.mymodule.apps.ModuleAppConfig,    libraryY.mymodule.apps.ModuleAppConfig,     ... ] ... codepre  pNow, I can add those app configs into my codeINSTALLEDAPPScode instead of modules. Conflicting is just resolved. Everything is OK until that point.p  pstrongHere is my problemstrong When I override the label of the codeAppConfigcode, my models in that modules are not discovered by codeDjangocode. When I runp  precodepython manage.py makemigrations codepre  pNothing seems changed. Despite I remove all migrations files, it did not even create initial one. I think, it does not see the models. Whenever I remove overridden label field from my app config, the models are discoverable back again. So, dont think my models location is wrong.p  pThis could also be bug, I dont know. But if I am doing something wrong, what could it bep  pThanksp

In my main activity the fragment transaction takes place in a switch block for the navigation drawer. Ive read that Please note that fragment should NOT directly replace itself or any other fragments. Fragments should be separate entities. What fragment should do is to notify its parent activity that some event has happened. But it is, again, NOT a fragment job to decide what to do with that It should be activity to decide to i.e. replace the fragment on phone, but to i.e. add another to existing one on tablets. So you are basically doing something wrong by designp  pAnother poster mentions A better way to handle this situation is by creating a callback implementation for the main activity to handle requests such as start a new fragment How do i set this up in my main activity so that it communicates to the sub fragments of my drawer fragments. Any thoughts on this much appreciated. p  pMain Activityp  precode    public class SampleActivity extends Activity           private DrawerLayout mDrawerLayout         private ListView mDrawerList         private ActionBarDrawerToggle mDrawerToggle         private DrawerArrowDrawable drawerArrow         private CharSequence mDrawerTitle         private CharSequence mTitle         CustomDrawerAdapter adapter         ListltDrawerItemgt dataList      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitysample         ActionBar ab  getActionBar         ab.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue         ab.setHomeButtonEnabledtrue          dataList  new ArrayListltDrawerItemgt         dataList.addnew DrawerItemHome, R.drawable.home         dataList.addnew DrawerItemHow It Works, R.drawable.howitworks         dataList.addnew DrawerItemEvents, R.drawable.events         dataList.addnew DrawerItemProfile, R.drawable.signin          mTitle  mDrawerTitle  getTitle         mDrawerLayout  DrawerLayout findViewByIdR.id.drawerlayout         mDrawerList  ListView findViewByIdR.id.navdrawer          drawerArrow  new DrawerArrowDrawablethis                      Override             public boolean isLayoutRtl                  return false                                mDrawerToggle  new ActionBarDrawerTogglethis, mDrawerLayout,             drawerArrow, R.string.draweropen,R.string.drawerclose                       public void onDrawerClosedView view                  super.onDrawerClosedview                 getActionBar.setTitlemTitle                 invalidateOptionsMenu  creates call to onPrepareOptionsMenu                           public void onDrawerOpenedView drawerView                  super.onDrawerOpeneddrawerView                 getActionBar.setTitlemDrawerTitle                 invalidateOptionsMenu  creates call to onPrepareOptionsMenu                                mDrawerLayout.setDrawerListenermDrawerToggle         mDrawerToggle.syncState         adapter  new CustomDrawerAdapterthis, R.layout.customdraweritem,                 dataList          ArrayAdapterltStringgt adapter  new ArrayAdapterltStringgtthis,         android.R.layout.simplelistitem1, android.R.id.text1, mNames          mDrawerList.setAdapteradapter         mDrawerList.setOnItemClickListenernew AdapterView.OnItemClickListener               Override             public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt parent, View view,                                     int position, long id                                       displayViewposition                      Running Fragment Transaction code here                                              Method that updates content frame with different fragments             private void displayViewint position                update the main content by replacing fragments                  Fragment fragment  null                 Bundle args  new Bundle                 switch position                      case 0                         fragment  new TitleFragment                         mDrawerToggle.setAnimateEnabledtrue                         drawerArrow.setProgress1f                         mDrawerToggle.syncState                         break                     case 1                         fragment  new HowFragment                         mDrawerToggle.setAnimateEnabledtrue                         drawerArrow.setProgress1f                         mDrawerToggle.syncState                         break                     case 2                         fragment  new EventFragment                         mDrawerToggle.setAnimateEnabledtrue                         drawerArrow.setProgress1f                         mDrawerToggle.syncState                         break                     case 3                         fragment  new ProfileFragment                         mDrawerToggle.setAnimateEnabledtrue                         drawerArrow.setProgress1f                         mDrawerToggle.syncState                         break                                      fragment.setArgumentsargs                     FragmentManager fragmentManager  getFragmentManager                     fragmentManager.beginTransaction                             .replaceR.id.contentframe, fragment.addToBackStacknull.commit                       update selected item and title, then close the drawer                     mDrawerList.setItemCheckedposition, true                     setTitledataList.getposition.getItemName                     mDrawerLayout.closeDrawermDrawerList                                  Override     public void setTitleCharSequence title              mTitle  title         getActionBar.setTitlemTitle           Override     public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item               The action bar homeup action should open or close the drawer.

Negative 1820 pIm writing a program to download a given webpage. I need to only use raw python sockets for all the connection due to some restriction. So I make a socket connection to a given domain the Host field in the response header of an object and then send the GET request on this. Now when the url is a https url, I think I need to first do the SSL handshake because otherwise Im getting non200 OK responses from the server and other error responses mentioning P3P policies. I inspected curls response to check how its able to successfully download while Im not, turns out curl first does the SSL handshake thats all the difference. curl is always able to successfully download a given object, the only difference always being the SSL handshake it does.p  pSo Im wondering how to do the SSL handshake in raw python sockets Basically I want as easy a solution which allows me to do the minimum besides using raw sockets.p

I have a function to check the validity of the codeFormcode, and then set the focus to the first control that doesnt have a value.p  pWithout Option Strict On, I could simply have a basic codeObjectcode, and set that to whichever control was missing a value, and then call codeobjMissing.Focuscode at the end, but with Option Strict On, the compiler doesnt allow the late binding.p  pI realize that if the controls were all the same type, I could cast the missing object to a codeTextBoxcode, for example.  Is there a way I can still do this using one variable to store the control to set focus to  Or should I just set the Focus immediately in each of the codeIfcodes that are checking for a valuep  pHere is an example of the code I am looking at txt are codeTextBoxcode, cbo are codeComboBoxcode, btn are codeButtoncode typesp  precode    Dim objMissing as Object      If txtItemDescription.Text  String.Empty Then         objMissing  txtItemDescription         strMessage  You must enter an item description.

Bit by bit, an array of values is used to count the amount of numbers with a 0 in the bit for the pass i.e going from lsb to msb pass by pass. These results from each block create a histogram  this histogram is then fed into an exclusive prefix sum scan to find the total number of values with a 0 in the current bit being tested.p  pUsing this value I then try and scatter the values into the correct position in an output array. There is the current offset position for 0 values dzeroPos and also the offset for 1 values donePos. As input values are checked and put into place the two offsets are incremented by one so each value isnt overwritten. I was just wondering if Im using the correct atomic operations to achieve this.p  pMy code is belowp  precodeglobal void scatterunsigned int dinputVals,                         unsigned int doutputVals,                         unsigned int dzeroPos,                         unsigned int donePos,                         int bitNum     int tId  threadIdx.x     int bId  blockDim.x  blockIdx.x      unsigned int mask  1 ltlt bitNum       ifdinputVals[tId  bId] amp mask         if a one in this bit pos         atomicExchampdoutputVals[donePos],dinputVals[tId  bId]         atomicAdddonePos,1      else         if a zero         atomicExchampdoutputVals[dzeroPos],dinputVals[tId  bId]         atomicAdddzeroPos,1            syncthreads  codepre

Negative 1820 pIm using a script which provides a toggle for switching my website from responsive to desktop modes. The script in itself works ok, in that when the text link is clicked it will switch.p  pHowever, the script by default is set against the cookie session, so when a visitor arrives on my site from their mobile phone browser, they can switch to desktop mode. Once they leave the site and essentially end their session, upon returning again from their mobile phone browser the site should display in the responsive mode once again.p  pThis is not currently happening, and the page will load according to how they last viewed it.p  pIve realised this is due to me not actually having created a cookie on the website, so the responsive switch script has nothing to work with.p  pIm looking for help on creating the most basic of cookies, I do not want to capture any other information aside from the session, so that I can leave the expire data value as default which will cause the script to work correctly on session end and then new sessions.p  pIve looked for instructions and seen some javascriptp  precodefunction setCookiemycookie,firstme codepre  pI really have no idea where cookie code would be written to, if that should be within each html page or within its own file Also suspect that is not a complete cookie script.p  pCan anyone please advise on the syntax Id require, and whether or not this should be written to the head of each html page on my site or notp

Negative 1820 pIm trying to develop a simple proof of concept that uses Passports Google authentication strategy with Restify and Bookshelf.js.  I would like this simple app to enable me to resolve a sessionsgoogle route which invokes Google authentication and redirect to sessionsgoogleReturn upon successful authentication.  For this simple proof of concept, please assume that the table that corresponds to the User model contains a record for the user that is authenticating.p  pBelow is the code that Im currently experimenting with.  Currently, this code results in an endless redirect loop after authenticating.  If I remove the passport.authenticategoogle,  failureRedirect   line within the sessionsgoogleReturn route, sessionsgoogleReturn resolves however req.user returns an empty object.  Im guessing that Im not initializing the session or binding the session to passport correctly.  The console.log output inside the passport methods appears to be suppressed, which is making this difficult to debug.

Negative 1820 pI need a suggestion for a service Im going to develop. I have a backend that communicates to the clients mobile devices some tasks to do at a certain time. A task can be programmed for being done in the future. In this case the backend should have a timer for each programmed task and, at the end of a timer, a push notification should be sent to the client in order to tell him what to do.p  pIs there a efficently way to implement this kind of timers on the backend I have thought these possible solutionsp  p1 When a new task is programmed a new thread starts and keeps in mind the time. At the certain point time reaches the limit programmed and the thread launches the notification and ends. p  p2 When a new task is programmed the notification is immediately sent with a field that reports the time limit to the device and this last manages the timer via a background service.p  pThese are the tecnologies Im going to usep  p Node.js  Express for the REST APIp  p MongoDb  Moongose for data managementp  pThanks in advance,p  pLuca M.p

Negative 1820 pFirst of all, I have read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions207477restfulurldesignforsearchRESTful URL design for searcha and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5020704howtodesignrestfulsearchfilteringHow to design RESTful searchfilteringa questions. I am trying to design more advanced options for searching in a simple and RESTful way. The answers to those questions have given me some insight and clues on how to design my previous application url pattern for searchfilter functionality. p  pFirst, I came up with quite nice and simple solution for basic filtering options, using patternp  precodeEquality search key  val  IN search key  val1 amp key  val2 codepre  pBut as application has grown, so were the search requirements. And I ended up with some rather unpleasant and complex url pattern for advanced searching options which includedp  precodeNegation search keyN  val  Like search keyL  val  OR search key1O  val1 amp key2  val2  Range search key1RS  val1 amp key1RE  val2 codepre  pWhats more, beside filters, query has to get information about pagination and order by, so the filter parameter has F suffix, order by fields has O suffix, and pagination has P suffix.p  pI hope that at this point I do not have to add that parsing such request is rather malicious task, with the possibility of ambiguity if key will contain . I have created some regexp to parse it, and it works quite well as for now, but...p  pNow I am starting to write a new web app and I have the chance to redesign this piece from scratch. p  pI am wondering about creating object in a browser containing all information in structured and selfexplanatory way and send it to server as as JSON string, likep  precodefilter  typelike,fieldkey,valueval1,operatorand,negationfalse,.. codepre  pBut I get strange feeling that this is not good idea  I really dont know why.p  pSo, this would be the definition of my context. Now the questionp  pI am searching for simpler and safer pattern for implementing advanced search including options I mentioned above as RESTful GET parameters  can you share some ideas Or maybe some insights on not doing this in a RESTful way Also, if you see some pitfalls in JSON way, please share them.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI know what makes sending json as get parameter, not so good idea. Encoding it  it makes it ugly and hard to read.p  pInfo provided by links sended by thierry templier, gave me something to think about and I managed to design more consistient and safe filter handling in GET parameters. Below is definition of syntax.p  pFor filters  multiple F parameters one for each search criteriump  precodeF  OPERATORNEGATIONTYPEFIELDVAL[VAL1,VAL2...] codepre  pallowed valuesp  precode[ANDOR][TF][EQLIINRA]FIELDNAMEVALUE1VALUE2... codepre  pFor order by  multiple O parameters one for each ordered fieldp  precodeO  ODINALNODIRECTIONFIELD codepre  pallowed valuesp  precode[09][ASCDESC]FIELDNAME codepre  pPagination  single P parameterp  precodeP  ITEMSPERPAGEFROMPAGETOPAGE codepre  pI think this will be good solution  it meets all my requirements, it is easy to parse and write, it is readable and I do not see how that syntax can become ambiguous. p  pI wloud appreciate any thoughts on that idea  do you see any pitfallsp
Negative 1820 pI have a table cell that contains 4 inline elements. The first 3 are an icon, and may or may not exist depending on the cell data. The fourth is a div containing text.p  pThe cell css has whitespace nowrap because I want to make sure all the icons and the text are always on the same line. However, when the text is too long to fit, it just goes off the screen because of the nowrap. I want the text itself to wrap when necessary, next to the icons. Like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxoZYF.png althttpi.stack.imgur.comxoZYF.pngp  pI have tried every combination of things I can think of. Anything that allows the cell contents to wrap causes the wrapping to happen between the icons, so that either the text appears on a different line than the icons, or the icons to appears on different lines from each other.p  pI have tried floating the contents left setting a specific width on the table cell even using an inner table as layout, which I know should be avoided. Basically the only 2 outcomes I have gotten are either nothing in the cell wraps, meaning the text just goes outside the containing area, or the cell wraps after an icon, instead of in the middle of the text.p  pThe one thing that seems like it was could work in terms of CSS is setting a specific width on the div that contains the text. However, this is not really an option because the width is variable depending on how many icons are being displayed.p  pHere is a jsfiddle with the basic layout I have.

So i started it again, installed core features, plus manager, but without SSRS and it installed without issues. p  pWhen after i try to add SSRS to the instance, it freeze at same point. The installation runs thru, until it goes to sqlRsConfigActioninstallconfignonrccpu64. In this moment, the installation freezes and dont go anywhere further. If i cancel the installation its the same, it remains frozen, i need to kill the process.p  pWhen i check it seen the SSRS is installed, in one attempt it even started the service but it was clearly not running as it should. When i try to use the repair feature of installation it says it couldnt be repaired because it never was properly installed.p  pWhen i check the logs, at program filesMicrosoft SQL Server120Setup BootstrapLog20150406SQLrsCpu641.logp  pIt seen the installation was completed, but its not working at all. I was thinking this was somewhat related to IIS, since there is nothing configured on IIS when i open IIS manager. I tried to install with IIS stopped, and also with FastCGI stopped used for PHP, and also the mysql server stopped, but nothing solved the issue.p  pAnyone have any idea what can i do Reinstalling the server isnt a option, it would require a lot of work to put the mySQLphp website working back, and also several other issues reconfiguring filezilla server that is being used for other services, plus i cant allow those services to be suspended.

Negative 1820 pIm using ALSA on Ubuntu to try to play a WAV file. Presently, Im able to read the wav header to figure out the files sampling rate and such then set the parameters on ALSA to correspond. This works perfectly for files with a 44.1kHz sampling rate, but other files with rates at 11kHz or 22kHz do not play correctly. Im not sure that I am setting the sampling rate correctly.p  precodeval  realSampleRate     Sampling rate to given sampling rate     sndpcmhwparamssetratemaxhandle, params, ampval, ampdir     cout ltlt sampling at  ltlt val ltlt  Hz n codepre  pThis gives the correct output sampling at 22050 Hz but if I follow it with this p  precodeval  realSampleRate sndpcmhwparamssetrateminhandle, params, ampval, ampdir cout ltlt sampling at  ltlt val ltlt  Hz n codepre  pthe output proceeds to say sampling at 44100 Hz which is obviously contradictory. I also tried using codesndpcmhwparamssetratenearcode but that doesnt work either, it says sampling at 44100 Hz on a 22050 file, and the audio throughout all of those were very messed up.p  pEDIT One issue is incorrect sampling rates, which will speed up the playing, but the real issue comes from mono tracks. Mono tracks sound really distorted and very off.p  pEDIT 8 Bit files are off toop

Restating the above, how can a take the above collection and render it successfully in tabs where Lists are the tabs and the associated Items render as the content I am running into issues if I use the code like this in my Usersshowp  precodeltdiv classrowgt      ltdiv classcol s12gt          ltul classtabsgt                   lt render lists gt           ltulgt       ltdivgt       ltrender items gt ltdivgt codepre  pListslist p  precode     ltli classtab col s3gtlta hreftabltlist.idgtgtlt list.namegtltagtltligt codepre  pItemsitem p  precode       ltdiv idtabltlist.idgt classcol s12gtlt item.name gtltdivgt codepre  pIf I try this, then my item partial gives me an error, because I cant call list.id, and it will just render all of my items without displaying them as an associated collection with the Lists. If I nest this and put everything after the ltrender lists  inside the list partial, then the collections work, but the closing tags end up causing issues. I am not sure how to resolve this.p

Negative 1820 pI am using the nganimate feature of angular to slide a menu in. The animation is working correctly but for some reason the final status of the menu flashes before the animation begins. The menu shows in its final state for a fraction of a second and then dissapears and begins to slide in from the side of the screen.p  pHere is the code for the animationp  precodeamp.ngenter, amp.ngleaveactive    include position100, 0, 0   amp.ngenteractive,    include position0, 0, 0  codepre  pI think the ngenteractive tag is getting applied and removed right away somehow. This makes the menu flash at position0,0,0 then disappear and begin sliding in from 100,0,0 to 0,0,0p

Negative 1820 pI am having trouble implementing my pipe. It reads Unix terminal commands from a text file for commands such as lswc where it opens a pipe so that the output of ls can be used for wc.p  pI have implemented it to parse program names ls, wc and store them in two separate arrays arguments and arguments2, fork a child process, then have that child fork another child process, then the second child process calls the execvp command and passes the first program to be executed.p  pThe output from ls is then written to the pipe by changing the standard output. The former child process then execvps the other process wc and reads from the pipe by changing the standard input.p  pHowever, wc loops indefinitely and does not seem to count the number of words from ls. Ls executes in a directory where there are words to be counted.p  pAny tips Thank you so much and sorry for the long explanation. p  pHere is a simpler example It forks, creates a pipe, and implements ls and writes its output to the pipe, goes back to the parent and reads from the pipe the output of ls. It still seems to be reading forever or not working right.p  precode   main.cpp   PipeTest    Created by Dillon Sheffield on 92815.   Copyright  2015 Dillon Sheffield.

Negative 1820 pIs there a way to update a single row in a Primefaces datatable made of dynamic columns  programmatically or not rather than updating the whole datatable or each cell of the row  Omnifaces method Ajax.updateRow works only for non dynamic columns. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 1820 pIs there a way of making pandas or sqlalchemy output the SQL that would be executed by a call to codetosqlcode instead of actually executing it This would be handy in many cases where I actually need to update multiple databases with the same data where python and pandas only exists in one of my machines. p
