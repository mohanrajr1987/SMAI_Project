Id like to have the contents of the codeltpgtcode leftaligned and centered in the form, so I added codedisplayinlineblockcode, codetextalignleftcode and even codewidth1pxcode to the style of the codeltpgtcode without the codewidth1pxcode IE7 at least doesnt center the codeltpgtcode, not even adding codemargin0 autocode, which may well be the cause of the trouble.p  pThe problem is that I want the image to appear at the top left of the codeltpgtcode, and the text to start to the right of the image without any line breaks except the explicit codeltbrgtcodes. If I add codefloatleftcode to the style of the image, or if I dont and the first text line is rather long, the text will begin below the image and not to the right of it, which is ugly. If I add codedisplayinlinecode I avoid the line break before the start of the text, but there will only be one line of text to the right of the image, and the second line will still be below it, which, if the image has a certain height, is also ugly.p  pIs there a way to float the image to the left and force the text to occupy the available space to the right of itp

Positive 36930 pOkay, so I have this problem and I cannot figure it out. Ive looked at numerous solutions but none have worked. I am working with a piece of software that has an embedded browser  as far as I can tell, its IE7.p  pI link the embedded browser to an HTML file.In the file I generate HTML via JavaScript based on values passed to the browser control via the software.p  pThe HTML I am building is a graph.p  pI have a container div that holds everything. Within it I have a div floated left that holds the scale for the graph. I then have a div called graph which will display the data. This div is xscrollable and has left margin so that it doesnt overlap the scale div. Via JavaScript I build HTML code and then set the graph divs innerHTML to the new code.p  pThe code I build consists of a column div. Within the column div are 6 other divs positioned absolute and given a top to show them vertically aligned with the scale and based on the values passed to the control.p  pThe number of columns depends on the number of values sent and will change.p  pAll of this works fine and the positioned divs show up within the column where I want them.p  pThe problem is that I want each positioned div to have a tooltip that displays the actual value. In the browser control I must work with, these tooltips always appear behind the positioned divs in the next column and I need them to appear on top of everything.p  pIn the example below, the tooltip appears above the data in the columns to the right. However, in the embedded IE7 browser the data in the columns to the right appears above the tooltip.p  precode    ltstylegt     .container              width 800px         height 600px         backgroundcolor dfd         overflowx scroll          .scale              width 100px         height 520px         backgroundcolor fdd         float left          .graph              width 1000px         height 520px         backgroundcolor ddf          .column              width 20px         height 520px         float left         backgroundcolor fdf          .value1              position absolute         width 24px          .value2              position absolute         width 24px          .value3              position absolute         width 24px          .tooltip span              display none         width 100px         backgroundcolor fff         border 1px solid 000         position relative         zindex 1          .tooltiphover span              display inlineblock         position absolute         left 24px         zindex 2       ltstylegt  ltbodygt     ltdiv classscalegtBlah blahltdivgt     ltdiv classcontainergt      ltdiv classgraphgt         ltdiv classcolumngt             ltdiv classvalue1 styletop 100pxgtlta classtooltip hrefgt1altspangttooltip dataltspangtltagtltdivgt             ltdiv classvalue2 styletop 150pxgt2altdivgt             ltdiv classvalue3 styletop 200pxgt3altdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcolumngt             ltdiv classvalue1 styletop 130pxgt1bltdivgt             ltdiv classvalue2 styletop 160pxgt2bltdivgt             ltdiv classvalue3 styletop 180pxgt3bltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcolumngt             ltdiv classvalue1 styletop 90pxgt1cltdivgt             ltdiv classvalue2 styletop 110pxgt2cltdivgt             ltdiv classvalue3 styletop 140pxgt3cltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netpra1y0gr relnofollowjsfiddlea simple example.p  pI have tried changing position absolute and relative on various elements.

Positive 36930 pIm working on a project that supports many different languages. We are currently adding Hebrew, which is a righttoleft language. Because of this, a lot of our layout has to be mirrored. I created a script that will do a lot of this automatically, but images have to be mirrored as well. We have a class called code.rtlcode which will flip whatever is in it horizontally normally only applied to images. The class is as followsp  precode.rtl      moztransform scaleX1     otransform scaleX1     webkittransform scaleX1     transform scaleX1     filter FlipH     msfilter FlipH  codepre  pThis correctly flips images crossbrowser, but it seems that IElt10 has very bad rendering artifacts. Is there a way to remedy this The only alternative is to keep a mirrored png file for every image in our project which is a lot, so this isnt a very a very feasible solution. I have attached an image showing the issue with IE7 on top and Chrome which looks correct on the bottom. In normal languages, the text is on the left and the picture is on the right, but in righttoleft languages this had to be flipped, thus the arrow had to be flipped, and also the glow effect on the text as well. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comKu6a9.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKu6a9.png altenter image description hereap

Negative 36930 pWhat is the best solution for maintaining backup and revision control on live websitesp  pAs part of my job I work with several live websites. We need an efficient means of maintaining backups of the live folders over time.  Additionally, updating these sites can be a pain, especially if a change happens to break in the live environment for whatever reason.p  pWhat would be ideal would be hasslefree source control. I implemented SVN for a while which was great as a semisolution for backup as well as revision control easy reversion of temporary or breaking changes etc.p  pUnfortunately SVN places .SVN hidden directories everywhere which cause problems, especially when other developers make folder structure changes or copymove website directories.  Ive heard the argument that this is a matter of education etc. but the approach taken by SVN is simply not a practical solution for us.p  pI am thinking that maybe an incremental backup solution may be better.p  pOther possibilities includep  ol lia hrefhttpsvk.bestpractical.comviewHomePage relnofollowSVKa, which is commandline only which becomes a problem.  Besides, I am unsure on how appropriate this would be.li lipa hrefhttpwww.selenic.commercurialwiki relnofollowMercuriala, perhaps with some triggers to hide the distributed component which is not required in this case and would be unnecessarily complicated for other developers.  p  pI experimented briefly with Mercurial but couldnt find a nice way to have the repository seperate and kept constantly insync with the live folder working copy. Maybe as a source control solution making repository and live folder the same place combined with another backup solution this could be the way to go.  p  pOne downside of Mercurial is that it doesnt place empty folders under source control which is problematic for websites which often have empty folders as placeholder locations for file uploads etc.pli lia hrefhttpsamba.anu.edu.aursync relnofollowRsynca, which I havent really investigated.li ol  pId really appreciate your advice on the best way to maintain backups of live websites, ideally with an easy means of retrieving past versions quickly.p  pstrongAnswer repliesstrongp  ul lipemKibbeeem p  ul lipIts not so much about education as no familiarity with anything but VSS and a lack of timeeffort to learn anything else.  pli lipThe xcopy7zip approach sounds reasonable I guess but it would quickly take up a lot of room right  pli lipAs far as source control, I think Id like the source control to just say that this is the state of the folder now, Ill deal with that and if I cant match stuff up thats your fault, Ill just start new histories rather than fail hard.pli ulli lipemSteve Mem p  ul liYeah thats a nicer way of doing it but would require a significant cultural change.  Having said that I very much like this approach. li ulli lipemmkemp  ul liNice, I didnt think about using Rsync to deploy.

Whe are now searching for the root of the problem but meantime we wanted to restart the server and get the customer going.p  pAnd now everytime we start the program it just says SqlConnection does not support parallel transactions. We have not changed anything in the program, its compiled and on the customers server, but after the possible deadlocksituation it want go online again.p  pWe have 7 clients computers running the program, each client is talking to a webservice on a local server, and the webservice is talking to the sqlserver same machine as webserver. p  pWe have restarted both the sqlserver and the iisserver, but not rebooted the server because of other important services running on the server so its the last thing we do. We can se no locks or anything in the management tab. p  pSo my question is, why does the SqlConnection does not support parallel transactions error comming from one time to another without changing anything in the program and it still lives between sqlrestart.p  pIt seems like it happens at the first dbrequest the program does when it start.p  pIf you need more information just ask.

Negative 36930 pI want to crawl a site with Greasemonkey and wonder if there is a better way to temporarily store values than with GMsetValue.p  pWhat I want to do is crawl my contacts in a social network and extract the Twitter URLs from their profile pages.p  pMy current plan is to open each profile in its own tab, so that it looks more like a normal browsing person ie css, scrits and images will be loaded by the browser. Then store the Twitter URL with GMsetValue. Once all profile pages have been crawled, create a page using the stored values.p  pI am not so happy with the storage option, though. Maybe there is a better wayp  pI have considered inserting the user profiles into the current page so that I could all process them with the same script instance, but I am not sure if XMLHttpRequest looks indistignuishable from normal user initiated requests.p

Negative 36930 pIm going through an application and trying to optimize some queries and Im really struggling with a few of them.

Everything else is less than 500 rows.p  pHeres the explain output a hrefhttpimg.skitch.com20090220fb52wd7jf58x41ikfxaws96xjn.jpg relnofollowhttpimg.skitch.com20090220fb52wd7jf58x41ikfxaws96xjn.jpgap  pEXPLAIN is relatively new to me, but I went through this line by line and it all seems fine.  Not sure what else I can do, as Ive got indexes on everything...what am I missingp  pThe server this sits on is just a 256 slice over at slicehost, but theres nothing else running on it and the CPU is at 0 before its run.  And yet still it cranks away on this query.  Any ideasp  pEDIT Some further info one of the things that makes this really frustrating is that if I repeatedly run this query, it takes less than .1 seconds.  Im assuming this is due to the query cache, but if I run RESET QUERY CACHE before it, it still runs extremely quickly.  Its only after I wait a little while or run some other queries that the 1030 second times return.  All the tables are MyISAM...does this indicate that MySQL is loading stuff into memory and thats why it runs so much faster for awhilep  pEDIT 2 Thanks so much to everyone for your help...an update...I cut everything down to thisp  pre SELECT i.id FROM items AS i ORDER BY i.timestamp DESC, i.id DESC LIMIT 0, 20 pre  pConsistently took 56 seconds, despite there only being 750k records in the DB.

If I drop the ORDER BY clause entirely, things are very speedy and the temp table  filesort disappears from explain.  Theres currently an index on the item.timestamp column, but is it not being used for some reason  I thought I remembered something about mysql only using one index per table or something  should I create a multicolumn index over all the columns on the items table that this query references sourceid, authorid, timestamp, etc p

This works fine and looks right  ie when I run the report I see all the data in one view, with the detail section expanded to fit all the records. However, the subreport is always clickable and that is my problem. If a user clicks on the subreport, ie on the child records or a graph or whatever it is I have there, theyre taken to the subreport. Its weird to them because they then see a new page which just has the details from that section on it. p  pWhat I really want is a way to have my report based off multiple datasets, just like Im doing now with subreports, but to make it so the user cant click on those subreports and drill into them. Ive never worked out how to do this. Is that because Im just approaching it all wrong, or just a limitation of Crystal Reports, or is there a solutionp  pIm using Crystal Reports that comes with Visual Studio 2005.p

There is a stored proc that is called to add hit tracks to the ContentHit table, its pretty trivial, it just builds up a string from the params passed in, which involves a few selects from some lookup tables, followed by the main insertp  precodeBEGIN TRAN insert into [ContentHit]      ContentId, HitCount, HitWeightId, ContentHitComment values     ContentId, isnullHitCount,1, isnullHitWeightId,1, ContentHitComment COMMIT TRAN codepre  pThe ContentHit table has a clustered index on its ID column, and Ive added another index on CreatedDate since that is used in the select.p  pWhen I profile the issue, I see the Stored proc executes for exactly 30 seconds, then the SQL timeout exception occurs. If it makes a difference the web application using it is ASP.NET, and Im using Subsonic 3 to execute these stored procs.p  pCan someone please advise how best I can solve this problem I dont care about reading dirty data...p  pEDIT The MostPopularRead stored proc is called very infrequently  its called on the home page of the site, but the results are cached for a day. The pattern of events that I am seeing is when I clear the cache, multiple requests come in for the home site, and they all hit the stored proc because it hasnt yet been cached. SQL Server then maxes out, and can only be resolved by restarting the sql server process. When I do this, usually the proc will execute OK in about 200 ms and put the data back in the cache.p  pEDIT 2 Ive checked the execution plan, and the query looks quite sound. As I said earlier when it does run it only takes around 200ms to execute. Ive added MAXDOP 1 to the select statement to  force it to use only one CPU core, but I still see the issue. When I look at the wait times I see that XEDISPATCHERWAIT, ONDEMANDTASKQUEUE, BROKERTRANSMITTER, KSOURCEWAKEUP and BROKEREVENTHANDLER are taking up a massive amount of wait time. p  pEDIT 3 I previously thought that this was related to Subsonic, our ORM, but having switched to ADO.NET, the erros is still live.p

Negative 36930 pRecently we added a auditlogs table to the database, and after some frustration I realised that there was already an auditlog table in the database for some reason. It wasnt being used so I dropped it. I deleted the Auditlog.pm and AuditLogs.pm files from my schema, and then regenerated. For some reason DCSL again created AuditLogs.pm for the auditlogs table, even though there was no longer an auditlog table or Auditlog.pm file that would conflict with it.p  pI have tried just about everything I can think of to get it to generate Log.pm without success.

Although it could be done with a text input box, I would prefer using something more professionalli liOf course, there is no direct way to interpret special control characters, such as color codes, cursor movement, etc..li liI had to implement an autoscroll management of the console, but it is not guaranteed 100 to work nicely sometimes the scroll locking doesnt work as expected, etc.li ul  pSo does anyone know something I could use to accomplish these needsp  pI found a hrefhttpqtermwidget.sourceforge.net relnofollowqtermwidgeta but it seems more oriented on handling a shell process and the Python bindings seems to let you run codebinbashcode only by itself than communicating with an already existing process IO.p
Negative 36930 pI have some data with some hard to deal with properties. There are two vectors that are taking a measure of quality from 01 at points along a physical object. These measurements are indexed according to the distance the measurement was taken from the bottom of the object. Then, a quality improving transformation is applied to the object, and measurements are taken again. However, the number of measurements are not the same, nor are the points on which they are taken.p  pIn R, the data looks something like this but with many more pointsp  pBefore transformationp  precode     value index [1,]   0.3     6 [2,]   0.6    16 [3,]   0.1    25 [4,]   0.8    37 [5,]   0.2    46 [6,]   0.4    58 [7,]   0.4    64 [8,]   0.2    76 codepre  pAfter transformationp  precode      value index  [1,]   0.3     1  [2,]   0.5     9  [3,]   0.7    18  [4,]   0.4    30  [5,]   0.9    44  [6,]   0.3    48  [7,]   0.4    61  [8,]   0.5    66  [9,]   0.3    76 [10,]   0.1    85 codepre  pUnder the assumption that quality along the object is continuous if not observed at every point, and that the ammount of improvement during the tranformation is dependent on the point along the object, I would like to be able to show the distribution of quality improvement.p  pSince there are different numbers of measurements, and different indexes, I dont thinkp  precodeplotdensityaftervalue  beforevalue  codepre  pis what Im looking for.

Negative 36930 pI have a very odd Problemp  pI use one of my base classes IEventlistener which gets implemented by many other classes. Most of the time the system works. But now a very strange problem occured.p  pOnce class CGUIService implements the interface, one method VGetListenerName works as expected the other one VHandleMessage gets a pure call when I check the callstack and I dont understand why . seems as if the vtable gets somehow overwritten or out of bounds ...p  pI made a screenshot so you can see variable before I call the VHandleMessage, which of course leads to a debug assertion R6025  pure virtual function call because somehow the implemented method isnt entered in the vtable of the IEventlistener.p  pHighres www.fantasyhaze.comcbErrorpurecall.png img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkiqOo.png altwww.fantasyhaze.comcbErrorpurecall.pngp  pI hope someone can give me a hint p  pEdit1.p  pSo just to explain it a little bit more I have created a new screenshot which shows the same process, but now I have included 2 more virtual function which are not pure and have a implementation becuase of time reasons, I have not the time to implement all methods again in each class which uses the interfacep  pThe purple ones are the new ones, The red one is the one which does not work The orange one is the method which was there before and which worked and still worksp  pYou can see on the left side, that the VGetListenerName,VHandleEvent1,VHandleEvent2 work debugpoint  current position and that those 3 are in the vtable ... but not the important one redp  phighres www.fantasyhaze.comcbErrorpurecall2.png img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkiqOo.png altvtable problem 2p  pEdit2.p  pSOLUTIONp  pThe main problem was, that CGUIService inherites from IBase. To have access to the Service I used a Service Locator which stores each service. Therefore it performes a staticcast in the Instance Getters ServiceGetServiceInstance and a staticcast was also performed to store the service as IBase. But IEventListener was not implemented in IBase furthermore the Service was cast back to IBase witout IEventListener and the vtable wasnt ok. Now IBase implements IEventListener and it works because the staticcast casts IEventListener correctly p  pThx for the hints guys  p

Negative 36930 pIve built my lexer and parser in ANTLR and they work really well in the sense that when user code fails to parse, it outputs useful error messages to STDERR, showing the exact line no. etc.  p  pThe problem is, I need to extract this information in order to display the error messages in my Eclipse editor at the correct positions, but it doesnt seem to be available anywhere except on STDERR.  Im basically looking for some kind of myParser.getErrorMessages.p  pHas anybody come across a solution to thisp  pI found the below link, however this only works if the user code partially parses i.e. so we still get an AST.

Negative 36930 pDISCLAIMER I am not asking how to make a URL shortener I have already implemented the bijective function answer found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions742013howtocodeaurlshortener742047742047HEREa that uses a base62 encoded string. Instead, I want to expand this implementation to obfuscate the generated string so that it is bothp  pstrongA not an easily guessable sequencestrong, andp  pstrongB still bijective.strongp  pYou can easily randomize your base62 character set, but the problem is that it still increments like any other number in any other base. For example, one possible incremental progression might be codeaX9fgE, aX9fg3, aX9fgf, aX9fgR,  ,codep  pI have come up with an obfuscation technique that I am pleased with in terms of requirement strongAstrong, but Im only partially sure that it satisfies strongBstrong. The idea is thisp  pThe only thing that is guaranteed to change in the incremental approach is the 1s place Ill use decimal terminology for practicality reasons. In the sample progression I gave earlier, that would be codeE, 3, f, R, code. So if each character in the base62 set had its own unique offset number say, its distance from the zero character, then you could apply the offset of the 1s place character to the rest of the string. p  pFor instance, lets assume a base5 set with characters codeA, f, 9, p, Z, 3code in ascending order from 0 to 5. Each one would then have a unique offset of 0 to 5 respectively. Counting would look like codeA, f, 9, p, Z, 3, fA, ff, f9, fp, code and so on. So the algorithm, when given a value of codefZ3pcode, would look at the codepcode and, having an offset of 3, would permute the string into codeZf9pcode assuming the base5 set is a circular array. The next incremental number would be codefZ3Zcode, and with codeZcodes offset being 4, the algorithm returns code39pZcode. These permutated results would be handed off to the user as hisher unique URL, who would never see the emactualem base62 encoded string.p  pThis approach certainly seems reversible just look at the last character, and perform the same permutation with the negative offset. And Im thinking that for this reason, it has to still be bijective. But I dont know if this is emnecessarilyem true Are there any edgecorner cases Im not considering p  pstrongEDIT strong My intentions are more heavily weighed towards the length of the shortenedURL rather than the security of the pattern. I realize there are plenty of solutions involving cryptographic functions, block ciphers, etc. But I would like to emphasize that I am emnotem asking the best way to achieve strongAstrong, but rather, emis my offsetapproach satisfying strongBemstrong.p  pAny holes you can find would be appreciated.p

Negative 36930 pThis is related to one of my other questions. p  pIf I am tiling a large image by creating a separate QGraphicsItem with the raster data as its pixmap, how do I keep track of the QGraphicsItems position within the scene Obviously for raster data, it is important to keep all the tiles touching to make a continuous image and they also have to be in the right place so the image doesnt look jumbled.p  pDoes each tile have to have positioning methods that move it in relation to its neighbors on the topleftbottomright This seems kind of clunky. Is there a better way to make them all move togetherp  pIn other words, if I pan the scene with scroll bars, or pick up the image and dragmove it around in the scene, I want all the tiles to also move and stay in the right position relative to each other. p  pWhat is the best approach for controlling the layout, which tiles need to be rendered i.e. only the visible ones, and populating the data only once it is needed Also, once a tile has been rendered, is the data from it ever dropped, and repopulated from the image file, say if it stays out of view for a while, then comes back later if someone pans to that sectionp

Negative 36930 pRight now, we have a small team of developers using TFS for our version control.  Im evaluating the possibility of us moving to a DVCS, and am wondering if wed need to give up some of the stuff we like about our current system if we moved to DVCS, or if we can find a way to support it.p  pRight now we a Stable branch, and 1 branch for each developer you can think of each devs branch as a feature branch that is reused from feature to feature.  The stuff we like isp  p1 Each time a dev checks in changes to his branch, we do a build and test of everything on the servers, followed by automatic deployment of all projects to that developers test environment.p  p2 Merging from any devs branch to Stable is done by me, so that I can have 1 last check on what is happening to our stable branch before committing the changes.  p  p3 If I want to help a dev with something, I can just grab latest from their branch and look at it on my machine.p  pIm trying to understand how this could work with a DVCS specifically we are testing with Mercurial.  p  pIm hoping to be able to pull off something like thisp  p1 We setup a central repository, and we create Main and Release branches in addition to 1 branch for each developer.p  p2 All devs clone the repository to their local machine.  p  p3 All work is done in their empersonal branchem against the local repository.  p  p4 When they are done, the would pull from the central repository, and perform a local forward integration merge from Main to to their branch, to integrate any changes that have happened in the past to Main.p  p5 They would then push their changes to the central repository.  p  p6 Some CI service would pickup this change, causing a buildtestdeploytodev of all our projects in that branch.p  p7 If everything was ok the dev would shoot me an email saying their branch was ready for merging to Main.p  p8 I could then merge in their changes, either by somehow connecting directly to the remove repository, or by doing a pullmergepush.p  pSo to deal with our requestsp  p1 Im assuming there is some CI tools that can watch a branch in Mercurial, and kick off a buildtestdeploy process like CC.Net.p  p2 I can still manage the final merge process from DevX to Main either by connecting to the remote repo, or by pulling, merging and pushing through my local repo.p  p3 I believe I could either pull changes directly from another devs repo, or I could just pull from the central repo, and then update my working directory to work on their code.p  pSo do I have this mostly rightp

But since the background of the visible section div is transparent the div just shows the overlay.

I also dont want to show a cloned copy of the original image because these background images are huge.p  pI couldnt find any documentation of how to do this online.

Negative 36930 pI have a C project in Visual Studio 2008 that, when executed, spawns another process due to a GUI library that is being used. However when I exit the main process either using CtrlC or by stopping the debugger, the spawned process and hence the GUI remains. This is a sideeffect of the library being used, and the nature of the project  it is designed to be embedded, and hence never really exit, but debugging and testing is Windowsbased. The orphan process then stops me being able to run the software again, without first killing it.p  pUsing Process Explorer I can see that the spawned process is a child of the process being debugged. I would like a way to, when I end debugging of a project, kill all child processes.p  pThe Chromium project has a macro which will a hrefhttpcode.google.compchromiumwikiWindowsVisualStudioMacrosAutomaticallygrabchromiumchildprocesses relnofollowgrab child processesa in order to attach to them. This is designed to be associated with a button in the VS GUI, and seems to be chromespecific that is, you would need a different button for a different projectparentprocess.p  pI have looked into using the codeDebuggerProcessEventsOnProcessStateChangedcode macro, the idea being that when the debugger stops I could walk through the child processes using a similar idea to the Chromium macro and ltevil voicegtkill themltevil voicegt... but this event never seems to be triggered.p  pAny thoughts The project is Makefilebased, due to the code being generated outside of Visual Studio, so I will be limited in the options I can set projectwise.p
Negative 36930 pThis is a seriously annoying issue Sure hope someone can point me in the right direction p  pI have a Facebook page, and on that page I have an app. Users can create a photo album based on their own photos and then email a link to their friends to come and view the album.p  pTo send the link, I am trying to use Facebooks Send button. The link is a link back to the Facebook page with 2 parameters added on. p  pThe first is sk which contains the id of the app. This ensures the user is taken straight to the apps tab.p  pThe second is appdata. This is crucial as it contains the id of the photo gallery the user should be viewing.p  pHowever, it seems that Facebook is stripping these parameters from the URL in the Send Button message. I also tried using an URL shortener both goo.gl and bit.ly. This works fine if the target is not a Facebook page, but with the link back to my app tab, Facebook seems to follow the link and replace the shortened link with the full url  stripping any parameters in the processp  pThere must be a way to share my app p  pAny thoughtsp  pThanks in advance,p  pJonp

Negative 36930 pIm attempting to compare two tables of equal length with a function, since I dont know of any other way to do so.  However, with the following function, it fails to register, and Ive no clue why.  Im hoping someone can provide insight to this problem or has a better way of comparing the two tables.p  pThe tables are being populated with the following code  p  precodestr  parameters determined by program all digits tableone   for word in strgmatchd do table.inserttableone,word end codepre  pIts identical for both tables, except, of course, the individual table names.

What am I missing  Ive tried searching for something like a table.compare function that someone may have already written, but no such luck in finding one.  Thanks for any suggestionsp  pAdditional informationp  pThe reason Im comparing tables is for a mastermaindtype game.  That means the following three rules must apply when comparing tables.  The function I created was to just get me started, thinking I could work from there.p  ol liWhen comparing the tables, if the numbers match, Ccount increases by 1.  li liWhen comparing tables, if the value exists in a different index position, increment Pcount by 1li ol  pFor example, with a table of values 1, 3, 3, 4 and a guess of 4, 4, 3, 1, it would return Pcount of 2 the one 4 and the 1 and a Ccount of 1 the three in the third position.  I think one of the hardest parts is going to be getting the comparison to recognize that the second 4 in the guess should not increment the Pcount at all.p

Negative 36930 pIm trying to write this custom addition class for very large integers, bigger than long long. One approach which Im investigating is keeping the integer as a string and then converting the characters to their int components and then adding each column. Another approach Im considering is to split up the string into multiple strings each of which is the size of a long long and then casting it using a string stream into a long long adding and then recombining. p  pRegardless I came across the fact that addition is done most easily in reverse to allow to the carrying over of digits. This being the case I was wondering the efficiency of the insert method for the string. It seems since a string is an array of chars that all the chars would have to be shifted over one. So it would vary but it would seem the efficiency is On where n is the number of chars in the string. p  pIs this correct, or is this only with a naive interpretationp  pEdit I now have answer to my question but I was wondering on a related topic which is more efficient, inserting a string into a stream then extracting into an int. Or doing 10nchar110n1char2...etcp

Why would that bep  pFor the record, none of these workarounds seem to be working for me  the closest Ive been able to come is forcing a keyboard to appear emunderneathem the dialog box using InputMethodManager.toggleSoftKeyboard.

Combine this with listeners which restore the selection state and the expansion state of the codeJTreecode and you get a version which works more or less, but the events originating from the codeTreeModelcode are messed up.

Negative 36930 pIm writing a user account system in PHP, with an emphasis on security, but Im stuck on refactoring it into something cleaner and more usable.p  pThe problem is trying to group the user account functionality together, but in separate classes. The way Im doing it now is, there are a bunch of classes with public static methods that all take username as the first parameter, and they use other static methods, passing the same username as the first parameter as well. Obviously, OOP is a better way to go, especially since each method must strtolower the username in order to make DB queries, and must handle the case where the username provided doesnt exist at all.p  pThe problem with putting everything in a User class is that it would be huge, and there would be a lot of completely unrelated code in the same file. For example, the Change Password code doesnt need to call methods related to validating the users email or changing the users unrelated settings.p  pI could have two classes User and AuthenticatedUser, where AuthenticatedUser inherits User. User would implement all the functionality that is possible without the user being logged in, and AuthenticatedUser would be all the functionality that requires a login  such as accessing the users encrypted data. Maintenance code could use objects of User, and GUI code would get an AuthenticatedUser object after the user has logged in. But I dont want to cram all of the functionality into User.p  pHeres the list of some of operations that are related to a user account, just to show why they wont all fit in one classp  ul liLoginli liLockout user if X attempts in past Y minutes includes methods for determining whether a user is locked out, adding a tick to the attempt count, etc.li liBypass the lockout with an email loopli liChange passwordli liAdministrator change password forceli liPassword reset email loop incl. methods for initiating the reset, validating the email token, etcli liSetget user data stored in plaintextli liSetget encrypted user datali liSetget account settings password reset is allowed, lock out the account on password failures, is bypassing lockout with email loop allowed, etc Ideally these settings should be setgot near the code whose behavior depends on them.li liGet the users username in the proper case as they specified it when creating accountli liEmail validationli liA lot of functionality only used by specific code. E.g. get user salt used for key derivation. li liA bunch more...li ul  pI was thinking I could do something like have a PasswordChanger class that inherits User, and implements the password changing functionality. So it would look likep  precodeproper  usergtgetProperName ... passChanger  usergtgetPasswordChanger result  passChangergtchangePasswordoldPass, newPass ... userLockout  usergtgetUserLockout result  userLockoutgtisUserLockedOut ... userEV  usergtgetEmailValidation result  userEVgttryValidateEmailtoken ... codepre  pThats the best solution Ive come up with so far. It lets me split up related functionality into its own file, and saves from having to pass around the username. But it seems really weird  Ive never seen code like that before. It forces the superclass to know about all of its subclasses, which is bad design. Any ideasp  pstrongEditstrong An alternative avoiding inheritance would be to have a PasswordChanger that emhas aem a User. Likep  precodepassChanger  new PasswordChangeruser passChangergtchangePasswordold, new  uses usergtgetUsername  ... emailValidator  new EmailValdiatoruser emailValidatorgttryValidatetoken codepre  pPasswordChanger emhas aem User vs. PasswordChanger emis aem User. The former actually makes sense, so I like this way a little better.p

I am wondering how I can define the codeisotopecode in the View class. p  pWould it be a good idea to define an event listener to watch for append into the .widgets and to run the script Is there a built in way of building views that are smart about when they are added to the DOMp  pFor that matter, it would be also useful to define a callback for when a View is removed from the DOM.p

Negative 36930 pstrongBACKGROUNDstrong Newbie to Android. Taught myself some programming in the past HTML, Java, javascript, some C etc. Bought my first Android device, a Zenithink C71 7 tablet from China. It is rooted and running Android 4.0.3. It has no USB connections, just 2 firewire ports, one marked Host, the other marked Dev. I bought a firewireUSB adapter and can plug a Belkin USB bluetooth dongle into the Host firewire port on the tablet to add bluetooth devices. Some devices work fine e.g. bluetooth mouse. My problem is getting my bluetooth headphones to work. The headphones offer both mono audio for phone use and stereo AD2P. The headphones work perfectly with my phone and laptop it is just with the tablet that things go wrong. According to the settings manager on the tablet, the headphones are detected, paired, connected, and the system reports they are operational and media audio is being routed through them. But, bizarrely, the audio continues to play through the tablets speakers and not the headphones. However, if I turn off the headphones the tablet audio stops playing. The headphones are working as a remote control switch and not as headphones I am at a loss to understand what is going on but I hope it is something I might correct by resetting some code or writing a little app to manage bluetooth audio. I have joined the forum to get some help with this project  and if I get hooked on Android then I hope I will start developing some apps too. p  pstrongQUESTIONSstrong Can anyone reading this suggest a possible cause for my problems and thus point me in the right direction to find a solution p  ul lipIs the issue likely to be due to hardware or software problems pli lipIf software, is this an issue with Android 4.0.3 or the manufacturers firmwarepli lipIf Android, where in the Android folders on my tablet do I need tobr look to check the coding to control bluetooth audiopli lipOnce I have a copy of the coding running my tablet, where online do I look for examples of how the coding emshould beem in order to runbr bluetooth I am hoping it is a case of comparing my tablets coding with abr specimen book and then rewriting my tablet to manage the routing so I can enjoy audio through my bluetooth headphones.pli ul  pIt might be a long project but if anyone can start me off on the first step then I would be very grateful  and I expect my experiences will be interesting to other Zenithink owners trying to do the same on their tablets.

Negative 36930 pWhen studying Java I learned that Strings were a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq8881291520779not safe for storing passwordsa, since you cant manually clear the memory associated with them you cant be sure they will eventually be gced, interned strings may never be, and even after gc you cant be sure the physical memory contents were really wiped. Instead, I were to use char arrays, so I can zeroout them after use. Ive tried to search for similar practices in other languages and platforms, but so far I couldnt find the relevant info usually all I see are code examples of passwords stored in strings with no mention of any security issue.p  pIm particularly interested in the situation with browsers. I use jQuery a lot, and my usual approach is just the set the value of a password field to an empty string and forget about itp  precodemyPasswordField.val codepre  pBut Im not 100 convinced it is enough. I also have no idea whether or not the strings used for intermediate access are safe for instance, when I use code.ajaxcode to send the password to the server. As for other languages, usually I see no mention of this issue another language Im interested in particular is Python.p  pI know questions attempting to build lists are a hrefhttpmeta.stackexchange.comq79835177950controversiala, but since this deals with a common security issue that is largely overlooked, IMHO its worth it. If Im mistaken, Id be happy to know just from JavaScript in browsers and Python then. I was also unsure whether to ask here, at a hrefhttpsecurity.stackexchange.comsecurity.SEa or at a hrefhttpprogrammers.stackexchange.comprogrammers.SEa, but since it involves the actual code to safely perform the task not a conceptual question I believe this site is the best option.p  pemNoteem in lowlevel languages, or languages that unambiguously support characters as primitive types, strikethe answer should be obviousstrike emEditem not really obvious, as Gabe showed in his answer below. Im asking for those high level languages in which everything is an object or something like that, and also for those that perform automatic string interning behind the scenes so you may create a security hole without realizing it, even if youre reasonably careful.p  pstrongUpdatestrong according to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5241096520779an answera in a related question, even using codechar[]code in Java is not guaranteed to be bulletproof or .NET a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma141393520779SecureStringa, for that matter, since the gc might move the array around so its contents might stick in the memory even after clearing SecureString at least sticks in the same RAM address, guaranteeing clearing, but its consumersproducers might still leave traces.p  pI guess NiklasB. is right, even though the vulnerability strongexistsstrong, the likelyhood of an exploit is low and the difficulty to prevent it is high, that might be the reason this issue is mostly ignored. I wish I could find at least some reference of this problem concerning browsers, but googling for it has been fruitless so far does this scenario at least have a strongnamestrong.p

Negative 36930 pI have a listView with some xml as the layout file. In this file I have a linearlayout as the root and this linear layout have a 60dp height size.p  pFor the background of this linearlayout I use a list selector  when this particular entry in the list is clicked the background will change to another color via png  gredient color while pressed.p  pThe problem is though, when used like this my listView give me different layout height sizes. let say my list have 7 enteries, one of this enteries randomly chosen as far as I can tell is a bit taller then the rest.p  pIf I ditch the list selector and use only 1 background png file, I get all of my enteries the same as they should, but I will lose the color change when an entry is pressed.p  pany idea on this here is the code for the list enteries layout.p  precode     ltxml version1.0

Negative 36930 pI need to display the percentage of each cell, of a pivot grid, column against its column total.p  pSo far, I have been checking possible ways to get the columns totals being displayed by the PivotGrid as I already know a hrefhttpdocumentation.devexpress.comWindowsFormsCustomDocument6230 relnofollowhow to insert a computed column using expressionsa but so far I havent found a place where these values are available.p  pI have also considered to handle the CustomSummary or CustomUnboundFieldData events of the PivotGrid but I dont see clearly how can I get the column total from there.p  pAnother approach I have think of is to try to use the a hrefhttpdocumentation.devexpress.comWindowsFormsCustomDocument1884 relnofollowPivotCellBaseEventArgs.CreateDrillDownDataSourcea to get the underlying records of the cell, but then I will not be able to get the column total, as the records returned by that method are only for a specific cell, not for the whole column.p  pIll appreciate if you can point out what would be the best approach for dealing with the cell percentage against column total requirement, including any of the previous or maybe another approach I havent think of.p  pAlso I will be glad if you show me a way of getting the column total from the pivot grid control, if theres any way.p
Negative 36930 pI have to write simple clientserver application that uses Unix datagram socket. Client may send information to server on the request from the server or he may receive information from server on the request from himself. p  pI have an idea that one thread will be waiting for user input that determines what request we want to send to the server, and the other thread will just wait for message on the socket from the server, if it is the message we requested it will write it to standard output, if it is the server request thread would write what server requested. I would use mutex so the two threads wont write at the same time to the same socket.p  pMy question is, how the sockets will behave if one thread will read from some socket and at the same time other thread will be sending data using the same socket, is it safe Or should I use mutex for this situation alsop

Negative 36930 pGiven a known number of images with the same width to height ratio and dimensions, is there an algorithm that determines the best way to present them in a screen whose resolution may vary Aka arrange them single page or double page.p  pFor example, to determine if you can present two images on the screen or, given the widthheight, to detect that only one would look better. To see if its better to have them fit on width, with some blank space above andor below them, or to fit on height, with blank space on the leftright.p  pI have made some attempts to determine such an algorithm of my own, but Im not completely satisfied and I was hoping there might be a better solution or maybe some advices.p  pUnfortunately, its not as simple as width  height  two images otherwise one image, as I found out.p  pSummed up, right now I do all my calculations based on the image height first and then check if the screen widths is larger than 1.5 x my image width. Larger means I decrease the height to have two images fit, smaller means I only present one image. Still, I keep getting some undesired results for certain combinations of image sizes  screen resolutions.p  pIf you stumbled upon the same problem and have some code or tips to spare, it would be greatly appreciated.p  pP.S. As you may figure out, this is about presenting a magazine. p  p[edit] I forgot to mention that Im using javascript vanilla, no pluginsframeworks for the codingp

Although I do have prior experience in Python, Im trying to adhere to these restrictions to get the most of the course. Things like str.split, lists, and a lot of the fundamentals of Python were taught, but nothing yet on imports  especially not things like groupby. That being said, how should it be written without any of the language features that probably wouldnt be taught in a programming introduction course.p

Negative 36930 pI have N quantity of clients, and each one has to implement a web service for my .Net app to consume.

Negative 36930 pIm looking at rearchitecting an existing Azure Web Role which contains multiple websites. I want to move the heavy tasks image resizing, packaging and zipping that currently runs in the Web Role to a Worker Role. They are noncritical so I will end up with a single instance of the Worker Role and multiple instances of the Web Role. However, I also want to move some of the low volume sites that run within the Web Role out to Azure Websites to facilitate minor deploys without changing the entire package. This includes the admin and backend sites, which are low volume, but will need access to the Worker Role. Will an Azure Website be able to communicate with a Worker Role endpoint Or is this a daft ideap

Negative 36930 pI have a problem where rails is adding unnecessary I think clauses to my belongsto association  restricting on type even though my association is using a foreign key.p  pThe STI setup looks like thisp  precodeclass Foo lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto apple end  class Apple lt Fruit   hasmany foos end codepre  pSo codeFoocode has an codeappleidcode column which links to the primary key column ID in codefruitscode, and codeApplecode is STI under codeFruitcode. Im happy with all of this.p  pNow p  precodegt Foo.joinsapple.tosql  SELECT foos. FROM foos INNER JOIN fruits ON fruits.id   foos.appleid AND fruits.type IN Apple codepre  pWhy is rails adding codeAND fruits.type IN Applecode Its a belongsto using a primary key of the codefruitscode table, so the type part seems redundant.  Can I stop rails from adding that part to the lookups and just get this p  precodeSELECT foos. FROM foos INNER JOIN fruits ON fruits.id   foos.appleid codepre  pI know I could do codebelongsto apple, classname gt Fruitcode in Foo, but I want the objects to autobecome codeApplecodes when theyre returned.p  pIn case someone questions my motives... I want to do this because the type clause is messing up the query plan postgres chooses when Im doing a query through codefruitscode to other tables yes, I have an index on codetypecode and even tried a multicolumn one on code[type,id]code. Thats a little complicated  irrelevant to describe fully here. p

Negative 36930 pI have a couple virtual directories in IIS 7.5 that point to network resources. Specifically, these folders hold PDF files. Ive granted a user permission to these folders, and their contents are accessible via web requests as I would expect. For example, codehttpmysitedir1test.pdfcode works perfectly for both virtual directories. However, when I try to expand one of the virtual directories the other works fine to see sub folders, IIS Manager becomes unresponsive almost immediately. p  pIm attempting to list the file names of all PDFs in virtual directory on a classic ASP page. p  precodeSet objFSO  Server.CreateObjectScripting.FileSystemObject filepath  Server.MapPathresourcesmyfolder Set folder  objFSO.GetFolderfilepath For Each file in folder.Files     If file.Type  PDF File Then         Response.Writeltpgt amp file.Name amp ltpgt     End If End If  Set folder  Nothing Set objFSO  Nothing codepre  pOn a separate page, I using identical code to list the contents of another virtual directory. However, this other directory as with IIS Manager causes problems by not responding. It causes the entire site to become unresponsive and I have to recycle to app pool to get it to come back. p  pThe effective permissions for the user account used to access these resources are identical. All files are accessible, and Ive confirmed they exist via hardcoding codefso.FileExistsfilepath amp filenamecode. Ive also confirmed that the folder object exists and its properties are being set. Even the codefolder.Files.Countcode is set properly in both cases. The issue is that the call to iterate through codefolder.Filescode causes the unresponsive behavior. Are there file size andor folder size limitations The only difference I see between the two directories is the number of files and consequently the size of the folder. The one that doesnt work is just over 1GB.p

Negative 36930 pI can say I am an intermediate programmer in CC. I am trying to find a website documents anything which hosts good puzzles or similar for C and C. My objective is to experience mind teasers kind of things for C and C. And certainly not any interview kind of questions. I would want to improve my techniques in CC, during a situation to solve a problem, or during implementation of an algorithm, dealing with specific logics etc.p  pSecond, I am also looking into new, simple and innovative problems just problems, to improve problem solving which can be practiced in C and C. For example, implementing shift rotate functionality this is very basic, but will teach you indepth bit handling, and to a advanced level like graphs etc. p  pBasically, to address I am expecting one, to improve my CC skills, and two, to improve problem solving skills using CC.p

Negative 36930 pI have a ListView and one of the rows the first one is a codeViewFlippercode.p  pNow, My problem is that when the codeViewFlippercode is scrolled out of the screen and back it gets reused. Usually it is a good thing to reuse only, but in my case when the ViewFlipper is recycled its starting from scratch. p  pI have 5 images in it and for example if the ViewFlipper was on the second image and you scrolled it out of the screen and back, its getting back to the first image. The timing and images are important since it is in sync with other components on screen and after reusing its out of sync.p  pSo, How can I make the codeViewFlippercode continue running when its out of the screen so it will get back to the exact position and timing when its back onp

Negative 36930 pI wrote the following program to generate all of the possible schedules I could have for the next three years Im on the quarter system but its ridiculously inefficient and, as written, wouldnt get me an answer in the next million years.p  pTo clarify, I do have text files already written specifying the classes Im interested in as well as the numbers, term, and year of each quarter e.g. Quarter 1 Fall 20132014. I want to limit it to generate schedules with 45 classes a quarter, as is hopefully reflected in the program.p  pI know that any way I would write this would be very slow, given the size of the desired result, but if anyone could help me to speed it up somewhat, or at least give me an estimate of how long it will take to complete 24 hours or 24 months I would be very appreciative.p  pTwo problems which Ive identified, but I dont know how to fix, arep  ol liMy compare function converts a list to a set back to a list and then searches every member of a list for every member of another listli liThe extensive use of lists in general, which according to my research are very memoryintensive the combinations function I use, for example, produces an iterator object which should be more efficient according to my research than a list, but I dont know how to use the iterator effectively and thus how to reduce memory usage also the GrandMasterLists method I use towards the end of the program, combined with all of the double for loops and the linearly increasing number of calls of the compare function in each for loop, must also make this much more inefficient than it needs to be.li ol  pThe following is very long 177 lines albeit also repetitive but if youre looking for a challenge or if youre a programming expert I would be very indebted for your help.p  pAlso I realize that a lot of what Im trying to do at each point might not be very transparent it was difficult for me at many points to try and come up with code that matches what I want to do so please ask me

On the receiving end, it matters not if this event has happened once or a dozen or even a million times.p  pRather than making many useless recvfrom calls, I thought maybe I could just use setsockopt to set SORCVBUF to 1 which I am hoping would cause the system to simply ignore all but the first message until it is read thus allowing another.

Negative 36930 pstrongThe Problemstrong Certain Android devices listed at the bottom of the question exhibit unexpected behavior when utilizing the codesetOrientationHintint degreescode function for videos taken with the front facing camera. The expected behavior is for the video to be rotated clockwise, but these devices rotate the video counterclockwise.p  pstrongMy Goalstrong To identify a variable within either the camera settings or hardware orientations that allows me to predictably know when this will occur. Specifically, emI would like to avoid special casing these phones in my codeemp  pstrongFurther Explanationstrong I am recording video using the standard codeMediaRecordercode object, and in preparing for recording, I set the orientation of the video using a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidmediaMediaRecorder.htmlsetOrientationHint28int29 relnofollowcodesetOrientationHintcodea. In the documentation for codesetOrientationHintcode, the following is specified for the codedegreescode parameterp  blockquote   pemdegreesem   the angle to be rotated clockwise in degrees. The supported angles are   0, 90, 180, and 270.p blockquote  pThe function is intended to add a composition matrix containing the rotation angle so that a video player can display the video as intended. So, what I do is that a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidhardwareCamera.CameraInfo.htmlorientation relnofollowI get the camera hardwares orientation using the codeCameraInfocode classa and use that as the codedegreescode parameter in the codesetOrientationHintcode fn. I have tried variation on this code using the AOSP as a guide, but I had the exact same result. p  pstrongA Real Examplestrong The Samsung Galaxy S3 frontfacing camera and most others, in fact will have a hardware orientation of 270, so I use this when recording, and the resulting video is displayed correctly. An HTC Vivid will similarly return a hardware orientation of 270 for the same camera, but will only be displayed correctly if I use 90 as the codedegreescode parameter in the codesetOrientationHintcode fn. If I use the 270 of the hardware orientation like any other phone, the video will be upside down.p  pstrongNBstrong The codesetOrientationHintcode function includes a warning p  blockquote   pNote that some video players may choose to ignore the compostion   matrix in a video during playback.p blockquote  pHowever, this is emnotem what is happening, because I can easily fix this issue on these phones if I fake it and put in 90 instead of 270.p  pstrongPhones that I have seen specifically exhibit this issuestrong HTC Vivid PH39100 running Android 4.0.3, HTC EVO 4G PG86100 running Android 4.0.3, HTC Thunderbolt ADR6400L running Android 2.3.4. Notice that they are all HTC phones. Perhaps someone at HTC mistook clockwise for counterclockwise.p

Negative 36930 pI do not have much experience with Rails. Back on Wednesday I was told to upgrade Redmine, and upgrade the plugins. Ive been working on this for 3 days now and it has been a shock to see how far Rails still has to go to enter the modern era of package management. p  pI am on Centos 6.3. At first I upgraded to Ruby 1.8.7 because that is what is in the Centos repository, and that was enough to upgrade Redmine.

Negative 36930 pI am drawing map in BB10. The map is divided into tiles. At start user gives a longitude, latitude and zoom level and the map is shown at that coordinate. I get a single tile by doing a http request with QNetworkAccessManager. At first 7x5 tiles are downloaded. But the problem is when user starts panning in the screen really fast and continues to do so for sometimes then after user stopped panning the tiles are downloaded with a big delay. Each time user does panning some new tiles are downloaded to show in the screen. Now because user continues panning for awhile there are so many unnecessary network requests with QNetworkAccessManager. And my guess is thats why tile downloading is slow. I tried aborting the QNetoworkReply of the QNetworkAccessManager using abort method for the unnecessary requests. But still its really slow. Is there any alternate way to achieve what I am trying Thanks.p

Both input and output files shares the same unique file id.p  pThe question is which approach is better in terms of performance and scalability to store all output files in one huge gridFS collection with compound keys containing original file id, quality grade and format type or to have separate collection for each quality  format pairp  pFor me both these approaches have their own pros and cons, i.e.p  ul liUsing one big resulting collection uses less configuration during read time, but more complex query will be needed to find the fileli liUsing several resulting collections involves simpler and quicker queries, but requires additional configuration to select to which collection this query should be addressed.li ul  pIt looks for me more like matter of personal choice...

Is it because of TIMEWAIT that the connection is not yet closed  Any suggestion on code improvement will be nice too.p  precodeSOCKET s SOCKADDRIN from int fromLen  sizeoffrom int port  1111  int listenOnPortint portNo      WSAData w      int error  WSAStartup0x0202, ampw  fill in wsa info      iferror              printError5         return 0           ifw.wVersion   0x0202              printError6         WSACleanup         return 0           SOCKADDRIN addr     SOCKET client      addr.sinfamily  AFINET     addr.sinport  htonsportNo     addr.sinaddr.saddr  htonlINADDRANY      s  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, IPPROTOTCP      ifs  INVALIDSOCKET              printError7         return 0           BOOL bOptVal  TRUE     int bOptLen  sizeof BOOL     ifsetsockopts, SOLSOCKET, SOREUSEADDR, char ampbOptVal, bOptLen  SOCKETERROR              printError12         return 0           ifbinds, LPSOCKADDRampaddr, sizeofaddr  SOCKETERROR              printError8         return 0           if listens, 1  SOCKETERROR  start listening              printError13         return 0           WSAAsyncSelects, hwnd, 1045, FDREAD  FDCONNECT  FDCLOSE  FDACCEPT      cout ltlt Ready to accept connection, listening on port  ltlt portNo ltlt endl      CreateThread0,0, amplistenForEvents, NULL, 0, 0      listenForEvents      return 1 ok   DWORD WINAPI listenForEventsvoid lp      HANDLE sockEvCreateEventNULL,TRUE,FALSE,NULL     ifWSAEventSelects,sockEv,FDACCEPTFDCONNECT FDREAD  FDCLOSE SOCKETERROR          printError9      for        ifWSAWaitForMultipleEvents1,ampsockEv,FALSE,INFINITE,FALSEWSAWAITEVENT0           printError10        WSANETWORKEVENTS wsaEvents0       ifWSAEnumNetworkEventss,sockEv,ampwsaEventsSOCKETERROR           printError11        ifwsaEvents.lNetworkEvents amp FDACCEPTFDACCEPT             SOCKET tempSock  accepts, struct  sockaddr ampfrom, ampfromLen             s  tempSock switch our old socket to the new one              char acceptAddr[100]             char msg  Connnection from [s] accepted.             sprintfacceptAddr, msg, inetntoafrom.sinaddr              sprintfsacceptAddr, strlenmsg  100, msg, inetntoafrom.sinaddr              cout ltlt acceptAddr ltlt endl             hasClient  true              else ifwsaEvents.lNetworkEvents amp FDREAD  FDREAD           char buffer[1000]           memsetbuffer, 0, sizeofbuffer           recvs, buffer, sizeofbuffer1, 0            receiveActionstringbuffer            cout ltlt buffer ltlt endl                else ifwsaEvents.lNetworkEvents amp FDCLOSE  FDCLOSE             shutdowns, SDBOTH              closesockets             cout ltlt socket closed ltlt endl             startServer  start server again             return 0                else ifwsaEvents.lNetworkEvents0            printError14         cout ltlt lNetworkEvents0 ltlt endl               void startServer     listenOnPortport  codepre  pThis is the PHP code.p  precode Get the port for the WWW service.   serviceport  getservbynamewww, tcp serviceport  1111   Get the IP address for the target host.  address  192.168.3.5   Create a TCPIP socket.  socket  socketcreateAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, SOLTCP if socket  false      echo socketcreate failed reason  . socketstrerrorsocketlasterror . n     die  else      echo OK.n   echo Attempting to connect to address on port serviceport... result  socketconnectsocket, address, serviceport if result  false      echo socketconnect failed.nReason result  . socketstrerrorsocketlasterrorsocket . n     die  else      echo OK.n   out    echo Sending HTTP HEAD request... result  socketwritesocket, json, strlenjson  if result  false      echo socketconnect failed.nReason result  . socketstrerrorsocketlasterrorsocket . n     die  else      echo OK.n    echo socketreadsocket, 2048  while out  socketreadsocket, 2048       echo out    socketclosesocket codepre

Negative 36930 pim having a problem embedding the python 3 engine for an app that need to run custom scripts in python. Since the scripts might be completely different, and sometimes user provided, I am trying to make each execution isolated and there is not need to preserve any data between execution of the different scripts.p  pSo, my solution is to wrap each execution between PyInitialize and PyFinalize. It looks something like thatp  precodevoid ExecuteScriptconst char script  PyInitialize  PyRunSimpleString script   PyFinalize  codepre  pHowever, this fails for a particular python script the second time a script is executed withp  precodedone Traceback most recent call last   File ltstringgt, line 8, in ltmodulegt   File Python33TestOutputDebugPython33Libcopy.py, line 89, in copy     rv  reductor2 TypeError attribute of type NoneType is not callable codepre  pThe python script looks like thisp  precodeclass Data     value1  hello     value2  0  import copy  d  Data dd  copy.copy d  print  done  codepre  pAs you can see, the first time around the script was executed the done was printed out.

Negative 36930 pI am  really confused about this . Java has two Timer classes, one under a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavaxswingTimer.htmlswinga , and one under a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilTimer.htmlutila ... why is that  Which one should I use if I want to simply run X every Y seconds Does  this mean if Im building a GUI I have to use the swing version for a timerp  pthanksp
Negative 36930 pId like to define a few Maven profiles, where some proerties about JDBC connections are defined, make them available via HTTP and share them in my dev team, among several Maven projects. Ideally, I would like to just add a reference in a projects POM and have Mavne download the profile defintions.p  pIs there a way to do that Alternatively, can it be done via settings.xml, sharing such type of file the same wayp

Negative 36930 pI have come around this design problem many times so far and I have always solved it the following way. However, I was just wondering if this is the right way to do it or if there is any better way. The language is Java but I would guess this problem would appear in other Strongly Typed Systems as well.p  pThe problem goes like thisp  precodeabstract class P     int p1 int p2   class P1 extends P     int p3 int p4   class P2 extends P     int p5 int p6   abstract class PHandler      void handleP p   class P1Handler     void handleP p            P1 castedP  P1 p           .....handle logic with P1        class P2Handler     void handleP p            P2 castedP  P2 p           .....handle logic with P2        final class PHandlerFactory      PHandler getPhandlerP p         test on P , ifelse on either InstanceOf or some attribute of P        return concrete P         client code  P p  getPFromSomewhereAtRuntime PHandler pHandler  factory.getp pHandler.handlep codepre  pNow, this code never gave me full satisfaction. p  p1st, I dont like the casting in concrete PHandler. Concrete PHandlers know they type they want to handle at compile time. Why wait till runtime Its a Java language limitation that can be avoided with any techniques like double dispatch couldnt get my head around itp  p2nd, The factory violets the OPENCLOSEDPRINCIPLE. I usually implement it by reflectionproperties file to avoid OCP. EDIT As we continue to add more instance of P, we need to keep changing the factory Unless using reflectionp  pI have also used Annotations on Concrete P implementations. Again, it violets OCP and even worse, P can have different type of Handlers with different purpose.p  pI would really like to know the experts view on this.  Again, this code mostly run in Spring container so any other AOP solution would interest me too.p

In order to do this, we had to upgrade to Bluedragon 7.1 and IIS 7.0p  pThe issue we are having is the application.cfm file is being called for ALL pagesfiles in our webapplication, and not just CFM pages. Thus, HTMLCFM tags are being injected into .js and other types of files causing them to not function.p  pDoes anyone have any clue how to configure this Application.cfm should only be called for CFM pagesp

Negative 36930 pI have a bunch of excel macros that take a csv table and produce pivot tables for reports.p  pI was just wondering if anyone has a clever way of error handling when a field doesnt exist and tell the user it was because a specific field was missing, specifying the field name in question.p  pThe thing I dont want to have to do is add a null check every time I want to reference a field. Id rather put error handling and wait for the exception to occur and tell the user at that time that it was missing.

Negative 36930 pRecently I tried out the new TFSService, and really liked the built in Scrum template for project management, and the new ability to create a team project managed with Git.

Is this really the casep  pHeres what Ive tried  p  ol lipIn TFS Service, I have a gitbased team project with some commits in it. In Eclipse, I connected to the team project, but it seems I cant pull or even see the source in any way.

In Eclipse I created a new project and used codeTeam gt Share...code to try and get the code into TFS.

I want to be able to select a cell of a doctor and display his patients on the segued view controller. His patients are contained in an NSSet. Im stumped here. Do I pass that NSSet in the segue code, or do I use a predicate in the fetch request to fetch only the applicable patient names Any code example you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 36930 pI have tried to see what would happen in C if we try to break an array of objects in a similar way we can try to do it in Java.p  pIn Java we can have an array of type Double[], for example, upcast it to Number[] because Double is a subclass of Number, and try to add another subclass of Number to array, for example, an Integer. The code would compile, but we would get ArrayStoreException in runtime, because the type Integer would be checked against the actual type of array, which happens to be Double, in runtime, and there would of course be a mismatch. The code could look like thisp  precodeDouble[] ds  new Double[12] Number[] ns  ds ns[0]  2.3               OK ns[1]  new Integer1    compiles, but we have ArrayStoreException in runtime codepre  pSo I thought  what about C Can we try to perform the same trick What will happen in runtimep  pHeres the code I tried, and the output.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  class A  public     Aint v  0 valv      virtual void g stdcout ltlt val ltlt  in An     void setValint v val  v protected     int val   class B  public A  public     virtual void g stdcout ltlt val ltlt  in Bn   class C  public A  public     Cint v  0 Av      virtual void g stdcout ltlt val ltlt  in Cn private     int stuff[10]    void fA as      as[1]  new A12   void f2A as      as[1]  new C22   int main      A bs  new B[5]     for int i0  ilt5 i              bs[i].setVali         bs[i].g           stdcout ltlt stdendl      fbs     for int i0  ilt5 i              bs[i].g           stdcout ltlt stdendl      f2bs     for int i0  ilt5 i              bs[i].g       codepre  pOutputp  precode0 in B 1 in B 2 in B 3 in B 4 in B  0 in B 12 in B 2 in B 3 in B 4 in B  0 in B 22 in B 2 in B 3 in B 4 in B codepre  pSee that both creating A or C and then copying it inside the array of B does copy data and, as expected, in case of C only the data that is part of A is copied  no memory corruption after the copied element, but the method of B is selected, meaning that vptr must have not been copied.p  pSo my questions arep  ul lipI guess that vptr is not copied in default assignment operator. Is it so Is it the only possible reason that we have method from B called but data from C objectpli lipCan we actually come up with an example that can make some bad or unexpected things happen, some runtime failure What I mean by bad, I guess, is to have an strongarray of Bsstrong, but an object of A or C in it strongnot B or subtype of Bstrong, an object that is alien to B pli lipOr maybe the C language does guarantee explicitly or implicitly by some combinations of its features that this cannot happen like Java when it explicitly raises ArrayStoreExceptionpli ul  pstrongUPDstrongp  precodeA bs  new B[5] codepre  pI actually changed this line at the last moment, to put emphasis on runtime selection of B method should not have done it, it is obvious because the method is virtual. I initially had codeB bs  new B[5]code and the output was the same.p

Negative 36930 pIm having trouble making accept states for an NFA for situations that would be easy with a regular expression or an apparently equivalent deterministic finite automata. p  pFor instance, what if the machine only accepts if none of the states are possible at the end You could use the powerset construction to make a DFA where the accepting state is the empty set. The only way I can think to do this with the NFA is to make every state accepting, and then flip it at the end so an accept is actually a failure. p  pEven worse, what if you had 6 states and want to check if, say, youre potentially in all of states 0,1,2, but definitely emnotem in 3,4,5 Again, this would be easy with the DFA. p  pIs there an easy way to tweak NFAs for these casesp  pThanksp

Negative 36930 pI am using Spring MVC 3, and JSPJSTL for the view.  I have incorporated reCaptcha in my form.  I am noticing some very strange behaviour that is not consistent i.e. it doesnt happen all the time, its random when I submit my form.  This ONLY happens with Google Chrome.p  pI have searched the web but was not able to find any information about this problem.p  pBasically, when I submit my form including a valid captcha, I am bounced back to the form page YET the captcha was VALID.  I got lucky and was able to debug it once and saw the captcha was valid, but the flow of control is somehow being intercepted DESPITE it executing the return ModelAndView logic.p  pSo in other words, it should return a ModelAndView controller with the new view in it, but instead the flow of control goes back to the top of the function and it hits the recaptcha code BUT by this time the recaptcha code is invalid, so it says FALSE. THEN it goes back to the original form page.  What is frustrating about this is there is a commit to my production database that happens because the captcha was originally valid and other valid logic that is executed as per normal behaiour.p  pThe reCaptcha box is the only box marked with an error and it states that you must reenter the code.  The only major issue is even if my reCaptcha was bad, it should come back immediately and say try again, which it does, but it SHOULD not appear as valid, highjack the flow of control and then redirect back to the form page.p  pThe end result is I get 2 exact records in the database because the user submits again.  It only happens in this way.  i.e. I havent come across a scenario when you have to submit 3 times or more.p  pThis is ONLY happening in google Chrome.  I have tried this on firefox and IE but I have never seen this issue.  Someone in another country just submitted information via this form and I asked them what browser they were using, and they confirmed it was chrome  I too have had enough encounters with this issue to know it actually is an issue.p  pDoes anyone know why the flow of control goes back to the top of the function One other thing I noticed is the flow of control doesnt always go to the bottom, its like its got a mind of its own.  One other time I was stepping through and it just jumped to the top.  p  pANY HELP would be kindly appreciated as I am trying to figure this out in a production system  Thanksp

So any good alternative to IFRAMESp  pI am not really JQuery specialist but i find this optionp  pcodetargetdiv.loadotherpage.htmlcodep  pLooks nice but if both pages parent and otherpage.html contains same CSS classes, selector etc. then in my case CSS from otherpage.html is taking effect. Any possible solution beside IFRAMEp  pBasically i want to display otherpage.html HTML content into parent page div without causing problems with CSS and other things on both pages parent and otherpage. p  pThanks for your suggestionsp

Negative 36930 pI have been struggling with the above for a while now, so would really appreciate any answers.p  pFirstly, my main aim is to take a picture when I receive an intent  inside a broadcast receiver.  I have tried quite a few approaches to the above but to no avail.  The following showing relevant code snippets for visual clarity code illustrates one approachp  precodepublic class ArduinoReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver  Override public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent  takePictureUsingCamera      codepre  pThe function  takePictureUsingCamera calls a function in a class that deals with the camera  e.g displaying a camera preview in a FrameLayout. The particular function calls the android takePicture function in android     this.mPreview.mCamera.takePicturenull, null, this.mPicture p  pHowever when I receive the intent, the app crashes. I felt that the reason behind this was that taking a picture was perhaps asking for too much work to be done inside the broadcast receiver. I tested this functionality using a simply picture capture using a button and it worked perfectly. p  pSo, the second approach that I tried was to create a Intentservice which will deal with the taking of pictures  and other relevant tasks like storing pictures, when an intent is received.p  pThe Services onHandleIntentIntent intent method will now have the this.mCameraView.takePicturefilename function. However, I need to pass my CameraView class as an object to this service using the intent. For this, I created a Serializable class and tried passing this using the intents putExtra method. After a few crashes, I realized that the CameraView Class was not serializable it is displaying the camera preview in a FrameLayout. p  pAnother alternative way I thought of doing the above was to create the cameraView object itself inside the new service but for this I need the context and the reference to the main activity  which I dont think can be passed using intents.  This leaves the option of starting a new activity to take the picture inside the broadcast receiver  again looks like doing too much work. As I said before, Ive tried a few approaches but havent achieved success in any of them. I personally didnt think its going to be such a problem. I would really appreciate and be quite thankful to any answerers.p
Negative 36930 pI have been working with java for a long time now, and I am starting to consider memory leaks. I intend to use classloader because I want to make my program more dynamic. After a bunch of googling, I read more about the ugly objects that stay loaded even when you dereference them. p  pI am concerned about my program having memory leaks. I know that all programs will have some amount of memory leaks, but is java really on the ugly side for leaking memory My question in that department p  pIs java worth dealing with for the memory leaks  and are the memory leaks in java really as huge as google made them soundp  pHow can I write my code to keep down memory leaks, like how should I reference objects with classloader and how should I dereference themp  pIs there an alternative to classloader without the problems or as bad of problems with retaining objectsp

Negative 36930 pSo Im thinking of moving a jQuery app to backbone. I have a View which I pass a collection that creates a list of Views which are each passed models. This view outputs the information into an input. Is there a way, I can propogate automatically from the view to the associated models or is this done for me autamtically. p  pSay for example I have a view that looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comV9pXT.png altenter image description herep  pI have the following and when I update this.updatevalue gets called. But how would I know which model has changed Can I get a reference to the specific model causing the codechangecode event Sorry if this sounds basic.p  precode  var HomepagePositionView  Backbone.View.extend     classNamerow,     initializefunction       .bindAllthis, render       this.listenTothis.model, change, this.updatevalue     ,     renderfunction          var htmlltdiv classspan2gt  this.model.getname  ltdivgtltdiv classspan1gtltinput typetext classhpscore inputmini pullright value  this.model.gethpscore   gtltdivgt          this.el.htmlhtml          this..hpscore.bindchange, this.updatemodel          return this     ,     updatemodelfunction        console.logthis model changed  this.model.id  this.model.id is not working         codepre  pandp  precode  var HomepagePositionsView  Backbone.View.extend       renderfunction          iterate through collection and for each model create a HomepagePositionView        codepre  pand I want the update button to be a blank if the underlying models have not changed. Is there a way in Backbone to tell which models have changed if I Church and State goes from 90  95p  pthxp
Negative 36930 pI used to be able to use Windows API calls in Excel VBA to set text on the clipboard.  But ever since upgrading to 64bit Office 2013, I cannot.

Can someone help me test and troubleshootp  pAfter pasting the code below into a code module in VBA, you can test it in the immediate windows by typing codeClipboardSetDataCopy this to the clipboard.code and it should set that text on the clipboard and you would be able to paste it into any other application.p  pI am using Windows 8, so I cannot use Microsoft Forms or the Data Object to manipulate the clipboard.

Negative 36930 pRight now I am trying to learn the assembly language on x86 systems. Therefore I am readying the book Programming from the Ground Up. Available for free at a hrefhttpdownload.savannah.gnu.orgreleasespgubook relnofollowhttpdownload.savannah.gnu.orgreleasespgubookap  pOn page 53, the way the computers stack works is explainedp  blockquote   pThe computers stack lives at the very top   addresses of memory. You can push values onto the top of the stack through an   instruction called pushl. [...] Well, we say its the top, but the top of the stack is actually the bottom of the stacks memory. [...]  In memory the stack starts at the top of   memory and grows downward due to architectural considerations. Therefore,   when we refer to the top of the stack remember its at the bottom of the stacks   memory.p blockquote  pThat part I get. Lets say the stacks memory starts at address 0 and ends at address 11 inclusively. That means there are currently three words 4 bytes a piece on the stack. According to my understanding, the word that is on top of the stack currently occupies the addresses 8, 9, 10, and 11. Since one word has 4 bytes and therefore occupies four storage locations in main memory. However, the book now says the followingp  blockquote   pThe stack register, esp, always contains a pointer to the current top of the stack.p blockquote  pOkay, in my example the esp register would hold the address 8. It points to the word that is currently on top of the stack. But...p  blockquote   pEvery time we push something onto the stack with pushl, esp gets subtracted by 4 so that it points to the new top of the stack remember, each word is four bytes long, and the stack grows downward.p blockquote  pWhat Isnt it exactly the other way around If I push another 4bytesized machine word onto the stack, this word will occupy the main memory addresses 12 to 15. Like they said The stack grows downward. Now the esp register points to the word that is currently on top of the stack. It starts at address 12. Before we pushed another word onto the stack, the address that was stored in esp was 8. So esp has clearly been added 4, not subtracted. Where do they get the subtraction from What did I miss I am very confused...p  pHelp is very appreciated p

Negative 36930 pI am working on a web game a hrefhttpszarada.netwyscigi relnofollowhttpszarada.netwyscigia for crossword solvers Polish language. One of features I am planning to introduce is to support moving a cursor on a crossword diagram using arrow keys. To provide even more user experience, I would like to support key press event not key down or key up for arrow keys wherever possible in order to let the user move the cursor by multiple fields with long key press.p  pWhat I was able to realise by examining several Internet resources including multiple StackOverflow entries is that only some browsers do support the key press for arrow keys.p  pHere comes my question  how to detect whether the browser supports the feature of firing a key press event for arrow key I was thinking about just detecting a browser plus browser version, but feature based solution would obviously be more scalable. I did not find anything useful in e.g. the Modernizr.p  pI am using jQuery, so that jQuerybased advice would be most beneficial for me.p

Negative 36930 pSo, it would seem that the segregation of .top and .pop in stack is no longer needed to be so strict in C11. p  pMaybe I am missing something, but the problem in C03 and previous was that if .pop were to return a value, there was a danger the copy operation could throw an exception during the element copy. Example code sample taken from a hrefhttpwww.gotw.cagotw008.htmhereap  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt      T must have default ctor and copy assignment class Stack  public     Stack     Stack     Stackconst Stackamp     Stackamp operatorconst Stackamp      unsigned Count    returns  of Ts in the stack     void     Pushconst Tamp     T        Pop      if empty, returns default                          constructed T     T        Top      For backwards compatibility                            private     T       v         pointer to a memory area big                           enough for vsize T objects     unsigned vsize     the size of the v area     unsigned vused     the number of Ts actually                           used in the v area  codepre  pIf you are to do thisp  precodeint main   Stackltvectorltdoublegtgt stack   fillstackstack fill stack with huge vectors   stack.pop danger of exception being throw from low memory  codepre  pIn C11 this problem goes entirely away since the element can be emmovedem from the stack, entirely eliminating the exception safety concern. That is under the presumption that the element is movable and that the move operation will not throw.p  pSo, my question boils down to, is there a real concert to safety exception concern if .pop were to return the element via move semantics p

Negative 36930 pWe are developing a web application in java with spring security. I tasked to add support for authenticating our users against Active Directory.

It worked fine with ldap and ldaps protcols.p  pBut couple of questionsp  p1ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider constructor is only taking AD url and domain name unlike LdapAuthenticationProvider for OpenLDAP, which needs mote input details like managerDN, manager password, user search base and group search base etc. Shouldnt Active Directory need all this data I thought at least it would need manager userpassword to allow connections Of course, in my test routine, I supplied only url and domain and it successfully authenticated users.p  p2 I need to write quick connectivity test routine to verify whether user entered AD url and domain are valid or not.

So not necessarily looking for code, but for someone to lead me in the right direction as far as research goes.p  pI am looking to have an application where a user kicks off a timer. When that timer has expired, the application will run some code. I need the timer to continue to run even when the user closes the application andor reboots the phone. So even if the phone dies, once it is charged and turned back on I need my application to kick off and recognize the timer has expired and run some code or continue counting down essentially checking to see if a particular date and time has been reached. In addition, I want the user to be able to relaunch the application and end the timer prematurely if desired.p  pI thought I was on the right track by creating a local service in a seperate process but further research shows that may not be best practice and to look into alarm manager with broadcast. So my question to the masses...what route should I be tacking to achieve my goalp  pThoughtsSuggestions Thanks in advancep

Negative 36930 pIm passing values on a url to a page on my site.  So when a user clicks a link different values will pass to the new page depending on which link they click.  Im using a conditional on the second page to vary the code that gets run depending on the value in GET.  p  pUnfortunately, for reasons unknown to me the conditionals dont seem to be working properly.  In the if statements Im using  because there are multiple passed values that need to trigger the same code on the second page they need to be named differently because they also all trigger unique code.p  pIt seems rather simple, I start withp  precodeifGET[id]x  y  z  block of code elseifGET[id]a  b  c  block of code else block of code  codepre  pI have printed out the values of the GET[id] to check that the correct value is being passed from the first page to the second based on the link clicked.  This is working properly. Every link I click prints the expected value.  The odd thing is I echod these values both within the first conditional and above it.  It printed in both cases, even when it printed a value that shouldnt have triggered that conditional.  Any ideasp

So rather than add a reference to hundreds of files, we updated the existing file to do the followingp  precodefunction loadjscssfilefilename      var fileref  document.createElementscript     fileref.setAttributetype, textjavascript     fileref.setAttributesrc, filename      if typeof fileref  undefined         document.getElementsByTagNamehead[0].appendChildfileref  function getRelPath      for var t  , n  0, n  0 n lt document.location.pathname.split.length  3 n t  ..     return t   loadjscssfilegetRelPath  JavaScriptjquery1.10.1.js loadjscssfilegetRelPath  JavaScriptjquery.formatCurrency.js loadjscssfilegetRelPath  DataValidationFunctions2.js  codepre  pNow that we have this in place, we sporadically get jQuery is undefined errors, usually coming from jquery.formatCurrency.js.  When we dont get that error, the jQuery works fine, when we do, it doesnt work at all.  This is sporadic from the same browser IE10 one moment to the next.  Since the dynamic code loads both jquery1.10.1.js and jquery.formatCurrency.js in the correct order, I would think the code would have had to successfully upload the former before the latter.  p  pWe have also updated IIS to turn off both dynamic and static content compression on the JavaScript folder where the jQuery lives as I read somewhere that could cause this issue.  I cleared all cache and still have the problem.p

Negative 36930 pmy problem is all in the title, I built a map with a center and zoom and I load a kml file representing a specific area according to the users choice. It works fine, except that my map does not auto center and zoom on the loaded polygon. It zooms but only the upper part of the polygon is visible. The PreserveViewport option does not help me more as I set it to true I dont get any change as expected... Maybe is there a way to get the kml polygons center in order to reset the maps center  Ive browsed the web with no success.

Negative 36930 pI have a Microsoft SQL Server that contains a database which has a table named codeTreecode designed to store a tree, with the following structurep  precodeCREATE TABLE TREE    id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,  parent INT REFERENCES Treeid  codepre  pAn example of the table once populated could be the followingp  precodeID PARENT  1 NULL  2 NULL  3 1  4 1  5 2  6 2  7 3  8 3  9 5 codepre  pWhat I want to achieve is that upon deleting a node, all of his children also get deleted.p  pAt first I thought this would have been an easy task, and that it could be solved by simply setting an codeON DELETE CASCADEcode action on the foreign key constraint, but SQL Server does not permit this operation because it strongdoesnt allowstrong neither codeON DELETEcode nor codeON UPDATEcode to generate strongcyclesstrong. it doesnt check if cycles are actually generated, so it denies every configuration that could possibly generate one, and this is one of those weird choice to me considering that stored procedures allow 32 levels of recursionp  pI tried using strongrecursive triggersstrong believing that the foreign key constraint would have been checked only after the recursive call was completed, in the following wayp  precodeCREATE TRIGGER insteadOfDeleteTrigger on Tree INSTEAD OF DELETE AS BEGIN  DECLARE idsToBeRemoved TABLE id INT  INSERT INTO idsToBeRemoved SELECT id FROM deleted   DELETE FROM Tree WHERE parent IN SELECT id FROM idsToBeRemoved  DELETE FROM Tree WHERE id IN SELECT id FROM idsToBeRemoved END codepre  pEven though this clearly is not the solution, as the last line makes an unwanted recursive call to the trigger resulting in an infinite recursion which would get interrupted by the recursion level limit of 32 imposed by SQL Server, the fact that surprised me is that the execution never reaches that instruction, as upon deleting the first level of children, foreign key constraints are checked and found to be broken because of children of the next level, resulting in the impossibility of performing this task with triggers.p  pHow would you perform this operation Is there a way to not employ nontrigger stored proceduresp  pstrongEDITstrong As I finally figured out, INSTEAD OF DELETE triggers are not meant to be used for custom deletion of data from a table, they are instead meant to be used to prevent a deletion that will in fact never take place, but will change data on some other table that in turn will make the original data appear as deleted.p  pThis is particularly useful when used in combination with views, that normally do not support DELETE operations. By defining an INSTEAD OF DELETE trigger which deletesupdates data from the table on which the view is created, one may obtain a fully tablelike view, resulting in another layer between the user and the data, that comes handy for many operations.p  pTo solve my specific issue, instead, I had to make every deletion go trough a stored procedure that i designed to perform the full operation. Will post it here soon enough.p

For eg For Indian standard time i shouldnt show the checkbox , for this if i have to rely on the property value then i would get it as false and i can hide it.

After a long googling and search i could see that .NET doesnt provide API to support my need. Hence came with a solution that ,p  pCheck whether SupportsDaylightSavingsTime property is true ,  if then Show the checkbox with state checked. If the above property value is false , then check DynamicDaylightTimeDisabled value in the registry HKLMSystemCurrentControlSetControlTimeZoneInformation . Because false here doesnt mean that the timezone doesnt support the DST instead it can also be disabled. If the value is 1 ,then show the checkbox with state unchecked because it supports DST but its disabled at the moment .

Negative 36930 pAs far as I can tell there are two librarys for  Twitter Bootstrap integration in GWT. There is a hrefhttpsgithub.comgwtbootstrapGWTBootstrapa and a hrefhttpsgithub.comgwtbootstrap3GwtBootstrap3a. I have just started a project built on GWTBootstrap, since I did not realize that there is another GWT Bootstrap integration out there.p  pBoth project look pretty active on GitHub, althought GWTBootstrap does have more members. I understand that GWTBootstrap is based on Bootstrap version 2. On the other hand GwtBootstrap3 wrapps Bootstrap version 3 and seems to have some more widgets avaliable. Since the GWTBootstrap project is still avtive, I assume they will move to version 3 as well, sooner or later.p  pSo what is the difference between the two projects Does someone have experience with both of them Which would you choose Is GwtBootstrap3 worth to swicht an already running projectp

Negative 36930 pIm trying to get zoom levels over 19 for locations in IstanbulTurkey in Google maps JavaScript API v3. I can get zoom level upto 23 in ROADMAP map type. However, when I change it to HYBRID, I can only get max zoom level of 19. The same problem exits in Google Maps v3 also.

I had a lightbulb go off and thought that making the Dealerbox a superclass to Clubs, Spades, and Hearts was the solution to all my troubles as I could have simple code in the superclass getting values for the above integers and do all the checking I need. p  pSo I wrote this for one of my subclassesp  precodepublic class ClubsBox extends JPanel, DealerBox implements Runnable  fun code   codepre  pThe problem now is that I keep getting an error. I assumed it had something to do with listing ClubsBox as being the subclass of JPanel AND DealerBox. So I stackoverflowed my problem and found an answer that stated that one cannot have a class that has 2 superclasses. Another answer to a similar question said that one COULD have a class that has two superclasses.p  pNow we get to the main question Is it possible to have a class that has two superclasses If so, how do I code it If not, is there a way around the restrictionp  pEDIT 21 APRIL 2014, 44 MINUTES AFTER ORIGINAL POSTp  pI have a new problem.

Negative 36930 pI have read a number of closely related questions but not one that hits this exactly. If it is a duplicate, please send me a link.p  pI am using an angular version of the flowjs library for doing HTML5 file uploads a hrefhttpsgithub.comflowjsngflowhttpsgithub.comflowjsngflowa. This works very well and I am able to upload multiple files simultaneously in 1MB chunks.  There is an ASP.Net Web API Files controller that accepts these and saves them on disk. Although I can make this work, I am not doing it efficiently and would like to know a better approach.p  pFirst, I used the MultipartFormDataStreamProvider in an async method that worked great as long as the file uploaded in a single chunk.  Then I switched to just using the FileStream to write the file to disk. This also worked as long as the chunks arrived in order, but of course, I cannot rely on that.p  pNext, just to see it work, I wrote the chunks to individual file streams and combined them after the fact, hence the inefficiency. A 1GB file would generate a thousand chunks that needed to be read and rewritten after the upload was complete.  I could hold all file chunks in memory and flush them after they are all uploaded, but Im afraid the server would blow up. p  pIt seems that there should be a nice asynchronous solution to this dilemma but I dont know what it is. One possibility might be to use asyncawait to combine previous chunks while writing the current chunk. Another might be to use BeginEndInvoke to create a separate thread so that the file manipulation on disk was handled independent of the thread reading from the HttpContext but this would rely on the ThreadPool and Im afraid that the created threads will be unduly terminated when my MVC controller returns. I could create a FileWatcher that ran completely independent of ASP.Net but that would be very kludgey.  p  pSo my questions are, 1 is there a simple solution already that I am missing seems like there should be and 2 if not, what is the best approach to solving this inside the Web API frameworkp  pThanks, bobp

Negative 36930 pstrongThe problemstrongp  pI have an atlast of various backgrounds which in the strongHDPIstrong folder is 5760 x 459 in size. Originally, the file size was 1.5MB.p  pIve tested this on a few devices, a Nexus 10 tablet which gets the bigger version of the file from the XHDPI folder, a generic tablet using MDPI, a Galaxy Ace phone MDPI Againand everything works OK.p  pHowever, I recently got hold of a new phone running KitKat.  However, it appears this handset is very lowspec.  1GB storage, 249MB RAM.p  pNow, when I run my app on this handset, it uses the HDPI version of the resources as mentioned above.  There are no errors, the app runs, but this particular resource simply displays as solid black.p  pstrongWhat have I triedstrongp  pI though maybe it was a memory issue, so I used all manner of tools etc to reduce the filesize down to 182kb.  However, when I ran the app, I got the same issue.p  pSo, I copied the LDPI image into the HDPI folder which obviously has a lower pixel count and it ran............... it displayed OK file size larger than 182kb.p  pWhat is going on here The physical resolution of the phone is 900 x 540.  Each individual image in the atlas is 960 x 459 so, with a bit of scaling this should fit fine as it does with other devices.p  pAnother thing that confuses me is that my XHDPI folder contains an atlas in which each individual background is about 12 the width and height of the Nexus 10s screen, so this gets scaled up.  However, using Googles scaling laws a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesscreenssupport.html relnofollowAndroid Supporting Multiple Screensa, after scaling, each individual background image contained within the HDPI atlas is about the size of the screen of phone Im using, so not much scaling required whereas I would again, prefer to use images 12 the size of the screen.p  pWhy is this phone not working with the current size file physical size, not filesize and is there any way to better manage or provide more alternate resources that just LDPI, MDPI, HDPI and XHDPIp

Negative 36930 pI am interested in using atmel avr controllers to read data from LIN bus. Unfortunately, messages on such bus have no beginning or end indicator and only reasonable solution seems to be brute force parsing. Available data from bus is loaded into circular buffer, and brute force method finds valid messages in buffer. p  pWorking with 64 byte buffer and 20MHZ attiny, how can I test the performance of my code in order to see if buffer overflow is likely to occur Added My concern is that algorith will be running slow, thus buffering even more data.p  pA bit about brute force algorithm. Second element in a buffer is assumed to be message size. For example, if assumed length is 22, first 21 bytes are XORed and tested against 22nd byte in buffer. If checksum passes, code checks if first SRC and third DST byte are what they are supposed to be.p

Negative 36930 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commwg9V.png altModelp  pIve got a model that Ive loaded from a JSON file stored as each tile w lots of bools for height, slope, smooth, etc.. Ive then computed face normals for all of its faces and copied them to each of their verticies. What I now want to do have been trying for days is to smooth the vertex normals, in the simplest way possible. What Im trying to do is set each vertex normal to a normalized sum of its surrounding face normals. Now, my problem is thisp  pThe two circled vertices should end up with perfectly mirrored normals. However, the one on the left has 2 light faces and 4 dark faces. The one on the right has 1 light face and 6 dark faces. As such, they both end up with completely different normals.p  pWhat I cant work out is how to do this properly. What faces should I be summing up Or perhaps there is a completely different method I should be using All of my attempts so far have come up with junk and  or consisted of hundreds of almost certainly pointless special cases.p  pThanks for any advice, Jamesp  pEdit Actually, I just had a thought about what to try next. Would only adding a percentage of each triangle based on its angle work if that makes sense. I mean, for the left, clockwise x18, x18, x14, x18, x18, x14   And then not normalize itp  pThat solution worked wonderfully. Final resultimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYhBcZ.png altsmoothedp

Negative 36930 pI am a beginner in SignalR although I had a lot of experience during a week. As far as I understand, before the Hub starts, the client methods should be registered. Otherwise, client methods such as onConnected or onDisconnected will not be fired, which is the problem I am having now. I am working on writing a chat application. I am able to connect to hub and send text messages, and other users in the room are able to receive the messages. However, the client methods are not called.

Negative 36930 pIm building an installscript MSI project with InstallShield 2014 professional. Im trying to create a log file of the installation.  Ive set the Create MSI Logs property to voicewarmup, and a log file is created in a random location in temp. What I need though is to create the log file with a specific name in a specific location. With a basic MSI project you could just specify a location and prompt the user at the end of an installation to chose to view it. I dont have the same option with the installscript msi project. I did manage to copy the log file to a specific locationname when running the setup.exe file via cmd setup.exe verbose filelocationlogname.log. Is there a way to have installshiled build the setup.exe file with the commandline parameters built in when I try to add the command to MSI commandline arguments in the release tab, it sends the command only when the .exe runs the .msi, and then I get an error saying the command is invalid.p  pAlso if theres a way to create a log file for the user to pick after installation is complete like in the basic MSI project  Id love to hear.p  pAppreciate your help.p
Negative 36930 pHeres what Id like to do use a SplitViewController but not have it be the first thing that shows up.  I want an initialization view which does some network stuff and then completes which then punches over to the split view.p  pIve got this working. BUT not sure if what Im doing makes sense and it has a weird behavior.p  pHeres what I think I know  to use a SplitViewController, it must be the rootViewController. Also, working with separate storyboards seemed the only way to get it to work. Ive tried having them all in one storyboard but couldnt get it to work.p  pMy first storyboards controller does its init and then, to switch to the SplitViewBoard storyboard and launch the split view, does the followingp  precode        let mainStrbd  UIStoryboardname SplitViewBoard, bundle nil         let splitController   mainStrbd.instantiateInitialViewController as UIViewController          if splitController is UISplitViewController              var  mySplitController UISplitViewController  splitController as UISplitViewController             mySplitController.delegate   appDel             appDel.window.rootViewController  splitController          else              debugPrintbadness          codepre  pNow, this all works fine.  With one exception.  After setting the rootViewController to the splitController, theres an 810 second delay before the split view shows up on the screen  Im imagining theres some way of telling the delegate or whatever to refresh or of just being more explicit but havent found it yet.  Is this way reasonable  Or it there a much better wayp

This as you can probably guess is derived in customesmtp.py from ESMTP in twisteds mail.py  which is in turn derived from the SMTP class  we have written a couple of function overloads for the myESMTP class, with more to come. p  pHowever, in twisteds mail.py, the SMTP class definition has a method validateFromp  precodedef validateFromself, helo, origin     ltltsnipgtgt     if self.portal          result  self.portal.login             cred.credentials.Anonymous,             None,             IMessageDeliveryFactory, IMessageDelivery          def ebAuthenticationerr                          Translate cred exceptions into SMTP exceptions so that the             protocol code which invokes CvalidateFrom can properly report             the failure.                          if err.checkcred.error.UnauthorizedLogin                 print Unauth Login                 exc  SMTPBadSenderorigin             elif err.checkcred.error.UnhandledCredentials                 exc  SMTPBadSender                     origin, respUnauthenticated senders not allowed             else                 return err             return defer.failexc          result.addCallbacks             self.cbAnonymousAuthentication, ebAuthentication          def continueValidationignored                          Reattempt from address validation.                          return self.validateFromhelo, origin          result.addCallbackcontinueValidation         return result      raise SMTPBadSenderorigin codepre  pSo if self.portal is defined, then the method returns before exiting the if condition  but if it is undefined, it will raise an SMTPBadSender error. And there is nowhere in the SMTP class definition that portal is defined.p  pIve noticed that self.portal emdoesem get defined in the stronginitstrong method for the SMTPFactory class  should we be using this somehow  if so, can someone explain how this would affect our server code That said, even this doesnt seem to set self.portal to anything meaningful...p  pdef stronginitstrongself, portal  None     self.portal  portalp  pPerhaps this a bug in the SMTP class definition Seems unlikely... Perhaps we just need to create our own overridden version of validateFrom, and remove the code to raise an error if self.portal is undefined Again though, Ive tried this  removing the 2 lines of code that generate the error outside of the if block  and the result was unusual....p  precodemail from melocalhost 250 Sender address accepted rcpt toyousomedomain.test 503 Must have sender before recipient codepre  pThanks as everp

With this I have the advantage to manage my entities without the knowledge of where they are actually being persisted.   p  pstrongMy problemstrongbr Now to my actual problem with this structure. Lets say I have a service codeFilterSerivecode which is responsible for all the business logic and how to create and populate the separate entities. When creating the codeFiltercode I would have to create my codeExpressioncode and use it inside the newly created codeRulecode and use it in the created codeFiltercode. Currently on my codemyRepopersistcode call I call the codeObjectManagerpersistcode and codeObjectManagerflushcode methods.br Tough by doing it like this I would always separately create and persist each entity, but for sure I want flush them all at once to prevent junk in my database if e.g. the last entity fails and the others only make sense when being related to each other. p  pNow I could say that I move the the codeObjectManagerflushcode into a separate method so that the codemyRepopersistcode actually only proxies to the codeObjectManagerpersistcode and then codeflushcode at the end of my service. But I dont feel so happy about this, because if I abstract the persistence away into my repositories, how would I know that the last flush actually flushes allp  pAnother way I was thinking about was to use my repositories as Doctrine repositories and only inject the ObjectManager into my service, tough this would lead to tight coupling to Doctrine then. But then I could at least suggest that if I flush the codeObjectManagercode that it flushes all of its repositories.   p  pActually the tight coupling wouldnt hurt in my applicaton, tough I am actually think that trying to completely abstract the persistence away is the cleaner solution. And why not try to reach the cleanest solution p  pSo whats a good approach to get around this issue Or am I just wrong and I should use Doctine services directlyp

Negative 36930 pIm trying to hand implement a federated token service.p  pThe authentication mechanism that were using is actually an OAuth provider, so we need our FP to accept the OAuth access token and use and transform it in to a claims aware identity. Basically thisp  ul liFP receives a token and verifies that it is from a trusted source e.g. Inhouse, Google, Facebook, etcli liFP fires a factory that figures out where to get its transformation logic from based on the incoming token format and the requested application IDli liFP uses the found logic to contact the application and receives a list of rights for the userli liFP generates a token and returns it to the clientli liClient uses token to make requests against the application. li liApplication verifies the token is from a trusted source and continues to the operationli liOperation checks to see if the requested resource is authorized within the claims of the token and decides whether to complete or deny the operation.li ul  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comJEpPRBD.png altenter image description herep  pIm having trouble actually figuring out how to generate the token once I get the list of rights, what do I do with them How do I generate a string token, etc. Most resources on the net are wrapped around the use of active directory, which is not what were using. So what I need to figure out is how to generate the token that the client will be able to use and how to consume that token in the application. Any resources would be helpful. I feel like theres a part of the framework that should handle this automatically, but Im just not seeing it.p

Negative 36930 pSo I love Meteor, but have had several issues with Iron Router. This time it seems I cant get Iron Router to render a template into the yield region. Initially everything renders fine, but when I click a link to go home pathFor ... the URL changes, but nothing changes in the view. This is very weird since I have checked that it is calling the route and I have explicitly written and tested this.render... to try to force it to render the template I want this does not work. Furthermore it renders properly once the page is reloaded with the changed URL i.e. it renders the home page. Any help would be much appreciated.

Negative 36930 pI have an app that makes a broadcast and receives message from multiple network nodesI also wrote these apps, so I can control what and how they send. While receiving this data, I need to separate each nodes message, so I can deserialize them to a meaningful Class that I have. Until now, I solved this by keeping every message of every client the same size, 267 bytes. However, this solution is obviously not correct.

Negative 36930 pI am currently rewriting a file uploader. Parsing scripts for different data types that currently exists are perl scripts. Program is written in php. The way it currently is that it allows for a single file upload only and once the file is on the server, it will call the perl script for the uploaded files data type. We have over 20 data types. p  pWhat I have done so far is to write a new system that allows multiple file uploads. It will first let you validate your attributes before upload, compress them using zipjs, upload the zipped file, uncompress it on the server, for each file, call the parser for it. p  pI am at the part where I need to say for each file, put the parser call in the queue. I can not run multiple parsers at once. Rough sketch is below.p  precodefor each file  job  execlocationtofileparser.pl file  using the pheanstalkd library  thisgtpheanstalkgtuseTubetesttubegtputjob codepre  pDepending on the file, parsing may take 2mins or 20mins.

Negative 36930 pIm working on a video streaming app for iOS, and I faced up with a problem  the app should be able to play partially downloaded videos.

Negative 36930 pIve been struggling with an HTTP timeout issue recently. After more than one month of investigation Im quite sure that it is caused by bad HTTP persistent connections.

More specifically, that bug causes codeNSURLErrorNetworkConnectionLostcode but my error is codeNSURLErrorTimedOutcode. However, Im not sure whether my issue is caused by another bug of iOS 8.li liThe behavior of my issue After some time of using  after some HTTP requests are successfully sent and corresponding responses received  one request would cause codeNSURLErrorTimedOutcode, and all followingnot too far away from the last one in time to reuse the persistent connection requests would causes codeNSURLErrorTimedOutcode.li liSome working workaround  ol liKill and restart the app.li liTurn WiFi connection off on iPhone to force using 3G4G.li liTurn air mode on and then turn it off.li olli liMy analysis From the behavior the issue seems to be caused by a gonebad persistent connection. All the subsequent requests keep using this persistent connection so all fail with codeNSURLErrorTimedOutcode. From the workaround we can see all of them work because they cause the bad persistent connection to be dropped and a new persistent connection to be created.li ol  pMy questionsp  ol liHave anyone else encountered this issueli liIs it a known bug of iOS 8li liIs it caused by some unconventional configuration of the servers I dont control the servers but I know they use nginx 1.6.1 and their engineers are working with me in investigating this issue.

I have two issues and 1 challenge.p  ol liNeither codekcode or codekernelcode expands to sdd or sdc, etc. instead i get a bunch of numbers.li liudev runs the same script twice on connection, so the only thing I can think of is because the script runs once for the main kernel e.g. sdd and again for the partition sdd1. But thats only a guess.li ol  pThe challenge I must contend with is that there are many of these devices physically plugged in roughly a few seconds apart from each other.  And they all match. I was using usbmount to auto mount the devices after they are inserted but even when using sleep in a bash script.  So.. I know I could mount them myself if I had the exact device kernel passed to the bash script.  However, since k isnt expanding to sdd or whatever.. I cant run the mount command in the bash script. Below is the rule Ive come up with.  Am I missing somethingp  precodeACTIONadd, SUBSYSTEMusb, ATTRSidVendor07b4, ATTRSidProduct0271, RUNhomeuserrecorder.sh k codepre  pIf I run codeblkidcode it shows me a list of all devices plugged in and their kernel path however there is no way for me to distinguish which one pertains to which udev rule is being run.p  pIf no one has an idea what could be the issue, I could have someone manually run a script after all the devices are plugged, that runs the command codeblkidcode, and then parses out that information to start mounting them individually, but Id prefer to figure out the first way.p  pAlso, if the 2nd way is the way to go, could someone help me parse out to get just this information when running codeblkidcode.  fyi everything after the first colon can be arranged in different order as shown below, so if youre considering 2 to equal LABELWS400S all the time.. it wont. examplep  precodedevsdd1 SECTYPEmsdos LABELWS400S TYPEvfat devsde1 SECTYPEmsdos TYPEvfat LABELWS400S devsdf1 LABELWS400S SECTYPEmsdos TYPEvfat codepre  pjust interested in anything that matches the LABEL and outputs only the devsd into a variable.p

Negative 36930 pHi Ive been making a game with the SpriteKit framework and I set a collision bit mask when 2 objects collide. One of those objects, lets say the object A, can have 2 states black or normal so when the two objects collide and the A object is on normal state it adds a point but when the two objects collide and the A object is on black state the game is over. This code is working fine for me on iOS 7 but when I run it on iOS 8 and if the A object state is black it acts like if its on normal state and adds a point.

Negative 36930 pstrongNote Question was updated for claritystrongp  pI have an application that is located on a server in EST. Im using an MVC5 application with Entity Framework 6 and a hrefhttpdatatables.net relnofollowjQuery DataTablesa to display my index pages. Im using a hrefhttpmomentjs.com relnofollowmoment.jsa to parse the .NET JSON Date.p  pThe server is located in EST and the users are all on EST. However, whenever I render the date on the jQuery DataTable using the code below, I get the date plus twelve hours. i.e. if on MS SQL Server the DATETIME field is 03312015 000000, itll display 03312015 120000.p  precodelocalOutput.Appendcolumn.ColumnType  DateTime  render function data, type, row   if data  return momentdata.zone  TimeZoneInfo.Local.GetUtcOffsetDateTime.UtcNow  .formatMMDDYYYY  column.Name  Date   hhmm  column.Name  Timestamp   hhmmss      else  return null ,    codepre  pOriginally, I asked how to get the UTC offset, thinking that the error was because it was converting from UTC to local time and adding the difference. However, EST is only 5 from UTC, not 12 hours. Ive tried changing the zone in moment.js by using the code above and it just returns an odd number. Some would be 03312015 040000 and others would be 03312015 050000.p  pI am at a loss right now for how to resolve this. I tried taking the easy way and just subtracting 12 hours from the date, but that returns 03312015 040000, which is only 8 hours subtracted.p  pAny ideas on how I can resolve this properly What am I missing herep

Negative 36930 pIve just recently come across a behavior inside codeBigDecimalcode that I wasnt previously aware of.

For example in financial calculations.p  pHowever I recently came across this fact p  precodenew BigDecimal1.0.equalsnew BigDecimal1  false codepre  pI have to admit I was surprised by this. I figure it is because the first has a scale of 1 while the second has a scale of 0, but still it seems counterintuitive. I think the reason Ive never run into it before is because weve always used fixed scale codeBigDecimalscode for financial calculations.p  pChecking the codeBigDecimalcode a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavamathBigDecimal.html relnofollowdocumentationa I can see that says that codecompareTo  0code should be used to check for equality ignoring scale while that codeequalscode compares both the value and the scale.p  pAre there any other similar gotchas I should be aware of when using codeBigDecimalcodes with different scalesp

Negative 36930 pFor a while now, I have been managing Lua tables via the use of functions and whatnot for character progress tracking. Lately, Ive been reading more and more about OO methods and metatables, and Im wondering if that is a better way to handle this. For instance, heres a breakdown of progress trackingp  pWhen a character is first initialized, I dop  precodeinittrackerpname, reset codepre  pwhich pulls a text file template of the starter database. This template breaks down the table as suchp  precodePlayer Name    Exp     Several keys here, values as 0   ,   Quests     Several keys here, values as 0   ,   Campaigns     Several keys here, values as 0   ,  codepre  petc. There are other keys under the Player name, but thats a gist of what the table structure looks like. I keep track of yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, and per level stats that reset appropriately, as well as track their previous stats last week, last year, last month, etc.. For that, I have functions that iterate through each table, copies to the last table, then resets the values on the current table.p  pWould it be better to use metatables and methods for this For instance, should I be doingp  precodePlayer[Current]update codepre  pwith an update function as a method, rather thanp  precodefor i, v in pairsPlayer[Current] do   Player[Last][i]  v   Player[Current][i]  0 end codepre  pwhich, by the way, does not seem to work anymore, as its always displaying 0p  pIf I would be better off using OO, how would I structure that into what I have nowp

Negative 36930 pThere is a stored procedure in MsSql. I want to add this stored procedure just one line of extra code but I want to do it in about 20 databases.

Whyp  h1Shorth1  pI am slightly confused at the moment, so my question might not be particularly well worded... I will edit this as my understanding improves.p  pThe original title of this question was g Compiling code with either o1 o2 or o3 flags and floating point precisionp  pI believe that my code is suffering from numerical instabilities.p  pGNUPlot gives a much better fit to my data than my GSL code does, which is surprising since I believe GNUPlot also uses GSL librariesp  h1Longh1  pI have written some C  C code which makes use of the GNU Scientific Library GSL. My code fits nonlinear functions to sets of nonlinear data. Algorithms which do this can be highly sensitive to the order in which floating point operations take place, due to the nature of numerical inaccuracies which result as an accumulation of numerical roundoff errors.p  pQuestion emCould these be caused by the effect of running with one of the optimization flags, codeo1code, codeo2code or codeo3codeemp  pPartial Answer I turned off any codeoNcode flags and recompiled my code, I the results may have changed by some small amount, ie codedeltax  x  1.0e3code.

In its strong2nd Pointstrong the Author saidp  blockquote   pOfficial document of Android suggests to avoid dependency injection   frameworks like Guice or RoboGuice, reason being is its a reflection   based library and it creates overheads at run time. Even it tends to   perform a lot of process initialization by scanning your code for   annotations, which can require significant amounts of your code to be   mapped into RAM even though you dont need it. Here I would say we   can use Android annotation library because it creates duplicate copy   of annotated classes so it wont create any overhead at runtime but at   compile time.p blockquote  pSo Should I use it or Not Any Help Will Be Appretiated.p

Negative 36930 pGood afternoon,p  pWe are developing an app for smartwatch and mobile phone.p  pWe need to transfer some data from the phone to the smartwatch and want to avoid using proprietary libraries.p  pSo we implemented a webserver in our app from which the smartwatch is able to read data.p  pThe problem is that in order to accomplish this, we need to write some data to a file every second. p  pThe smartwatch is downloading that data to a file every second. This means every second there are some bytes written on flash memory.p  pWe are wondering how harmful for the memory of our devices this is. Wed rather avoid rewriting the server to use RAM only.p  pSo we are wondering, since the OSes are keeping logs themselves on memory, if it is bad practice to write to a file every second.p  pThanks in advance,p

Negative 36930 pMy application has a number of objects in an internal list, and I need to be able to log them e.g. once a second and later recreate the state of the list at any time by querying the log file.p  pThe current implementation logs the entire list every second, which is great for retrieval because I can simply load the log file, scan through it until I reach the desired time, and load the stored list.p  pHowever, the majority of my objects 90 rarely change, so it is wasteful in terms of disk space to continually log them at a set interval.p  pI am considering switching to a delta based log where only the changed objects are logged every second. Unfortunately this means it becomes hard to find the true state of the list at any one recorded time, without playing back the entire file to catch those objects that had not changed for a while before the desired recall time.p  pAn alternative could be to store every second both the changed objects and the lastchanged time for each unchanged object, so that a log reader would know where to look for them.

Negative 36930 pIm controlling the duration of tasks for a project and, for example, I have a task that lasts from 01082015 D2 to 31072017 E2 so writing DAYS360D2E230 that cell returns the value 24 months. I want to have another cell showing the remaining time from the present month until the task is due. Since we are in September that cell now should be 22 and should update automatically every month so that on October the 1st, the cell should return 21 until on July the 1st 2017 it shows 0 The solution of course should be applied to all the other tasks independently of how long they last the returned value should be on a monthly scale.

Negative 36930 pI just uploaded my codeigniter website to the live server, and then i had to take care of some errors that popped up. The problem i am running into now however is quite strange. My main Page controller compiles several views together to construct a page. For example, i add the header, navbar, content and the footer to the page through my controller, but only the content view makes it through. Here is the main function that constructs my page in the Page controllerp  precodepublic function viewpage  home               if fileexistsAPPPATH . viewspages . page . .php               If the page does not exist             show404                   data[title]  ucfirstpage  Capitalize the first letter of title          thisgtloadgtviewtemplatesheader, data  Load the Header         thisgtloadgtviewtemplatesnavbar, data  Load the Navbar         thisgtloadgtviewpages . page  Load the defined page         thisgtloadgtviewtemplatesfooter  Load the footer      codepre  pThe server i uploaded it to is a Linux server, which has a very high case sensitivity. I had to rename my controller from page.php to Page.php just for codeigniter to find the view i was trying to construct. Though my missing view error has been solved, only my page makes it through my controller, and not the files that are inside the templates folder.p  pThe website works perfecly fine on my windows Xampp server, but does not work on this online environment. I checked all my edited files for loweruppercase issues, but could not find any. As far as i could find out, the codeigniter files should natively support both linux and windows. Does anyone know what i have done wrong I am quite new to codeigniter.p
