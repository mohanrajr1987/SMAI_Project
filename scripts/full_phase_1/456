Positive 456 pWe use git for source control. Each time there is a commit from developers, a script would modify a build file and checks in the file. The script commits the build file with a message that follows a pattern. So the commit history is like the followingp  ul liscript checkin build file 003li lifix this bugli liscript checkin build file 002li liresolve that storyli ul  pWhat I want to do is to remove all commits by the script. Now, obviously, this is very different from removing a particular commit.p  pI have the freedom to start a brand new repository by copying from existing repository, but I still want to preserve the developers commit history as much as possible, while getting rid of the scripts commit history.p  pIs that possiblep  pNote  the scripts commits only changed this single file that is, the build file, and did not change any other file. And, no developers commit ever changed this particular file.p  pSo far what I have been doing is to run bfg tool to delete that particular build file from the git repo. Only the commits from the script ever changed the build file, so I am hoping by removing the build file, the associated commits would be squashed away by git.p  pBut, what I found is the build file is gone, yet all commits are preserved, and those commits, curiously, having 0 changes.p  pSo my next question is is it possible to ask git to remove commits with 0 changesp

Positive 456 pIm in a project with 2 other developers.br A short while back one of the other devs tried to create a new testing branch. He figured that he didnt know Git well enough to keep merging stuff and moved back to using the trunk.

Positive 456 pOur code base is split between several projects that have some dependency relationships between them. Say that executable codeEcode depends on static library codeLcode to be build. Therefore, within project codeEcode, some information is written stating it depends on codeLcode.p  pThe issue comes when handling the versions of these projects. codeEcode has codetrunkcode, codebranchcode the latest, ignore older ones, and codetagscode. Same for codeLcode that also has codetrunkcode, codebranchcode, and codetagscode.p  ul licodeEtrunkcode depends on codeLtrunkcode.li licodeEbranchcode depends on codeLbranchcode.li licodeEtags1.1code depends on codeLtags2.1code.li ul  pThe issue pops up when tagging. Indeed, we create the tag by copying the branch content. However, within codeEbranchcode the dependency is on codeLbranchcode. Therefore we usually first create codeEtagcode, and then change the dependencies within this tag. This is not good thing to change stuff in a tag. Furthermore its error prone as one can easily forget to change these dependencies it already happen, leaving us with a tag of a project depending on branches of other projects. Not exactly the purpose of a tag.p  pWeve tried to create another branch directory codereleasecode. This directory is a stagging area, where all dependencies are on sub project tags. Its this codereleasecode that is copied to codetagscode. This has proven possible where a project is mainly a dependencies project think of an overall project gathering everything for a final setup with very few code. But for other projects, this would mean managing all of codetrunkcode, codebranchescode, and codereleasescode. Impracticable.p  pDoes anyone know strategies for handling dependencies and taggingp

Negative 456 pIve got a unidirectional tree of objects, in which each objects points to its parent. Given an object, I need to obtain its entire subtree of descendants, as a collection of objects. The objects are not actually in any data structure, but I can easily get a collection of all the objects.p  pThe naive approach is to examine each object in the batch, see if the given object is an ancestor, and keep it aside.

Negative 456 pIve tried various methods to strip the license from Project Gutenberg texts, for use as a corpus for a language learning project, but I cant seem to come up with an unsupervised, reliable approach.  The best heuristic Ive come up with so far is stripping the first twenty eight lines and the last 398, which worked for a large number of the texts.  Any suggestions as to ways I can automatically strip the text which is very similar for lots of the texts, but with slight differences in each case, and a few different templates, as well, as well as suggestions for how to verify that the text has been stripped accurately, would be very useful.p

Negative 456 pI have a requirement to take a snapshot of a current database and clone it into the same database, with new Primary Keys.p  pThe schema in question consists of about 10 tables, but a few of the tables will potentially contain hundreds of thousands to 1 million records that need to be duplicated.p  pWhat are my options herep  pIm afraid that writing a SPROC will require a locking of the database rows in question for concurrency for the entire duration of the operation, which is quite annoying to other users.  How long would such an operation take, assuming that we can optimize it to the full extent sqlserver allows  Is it going to be 30 seconds to 1 minute to perform this many inserts  Im not able to lock the whole tables and do a bulk insert, because there are other users under other accounts that are using the same tables independently.p  pDepending on performance expectations, an alternative would be to dump the current db into an xml file and then asynchronously clone the db from this xml file at leisure in the background.  The obvious advantage of this is that the db is only locked for the time it takes to do the xml dump, and the inserts can run in the background.p  pIf a good DBA can get the clone operation to execute start to finish in under 10 seconds, then its probably not worth the complexity of the xmldumpwebservice solution.  But if its a lost cause, and inserting potentially millions of rows is likely to balloon out in time, then Id rather start out with the xml approach right away.p  pOr maybe theres an entirely better approach altogetherp  pThanks a lot for any insights you can provide.p

Negative 456 pI read the following in an a hrefhttpwww.topcoder.comtcmoduleStaticampd1featuresampd2071003 relnofollowarticlea p  blockquote   pImmutable objects are particularly   handy for implementing certain common   idioms such as undoredo and abortable   transactions. Take undo for example. A   common technique for implementing undo   is to keep a stack of objects that   somehow know how to run each command   in reverse the socalled Command   Pattern. However, figuring out how   to run a command in reverse can be   tricky. A simpler technique is to   maintain a stack of immutable objects   representing the state of the system   between successive commands. Then, to   undo a command, you simply revert back   to the previous system state and   probably store the current state on   the redo stack.p blockquote  pHowver, the article does not show a good practical example of how immutable objects could be used to implement undo operations.  For example...deleting 10 emails from a gmail inbox.  Once you do that, it has an undo option.  How would an immutable object help in this regardp

Negative 456 pMy visual studio 2005 solution sometimes does not open the entire projects.

Each layer consists of large amount of .CS and .VB classes. So, when I open the solution file .sln, it only opens the Web.App project without opening the others. p  pHas anybody encountered this kind of issue in VS2005 and if you have had what you did to fix it, please let me know.

Its all a bit scrappy  the svnignore property has gotten quite big, and its not immediately apparent that the scripts in one dir are related to the code in some package down under codesrccode, while those in another are for starting and stopping tomcat.p  pIm drawn to the a hrefhttpmaven.apache.orgguidesintroductionintroductiontothestandarddirectorylayout.html relnofollowmaven standard directory layouta, but Ive not used it before.

Negative 456 pWe are currently working on a project with both actionscript and Java. Up to now, we were using Ant as our main build tool, but the dumb amount of duplication it implies and the lack of flexibility we are building a pretty large amount of small subprojects, and copying all of the build files every time is a pain are pushing us towards a change of tools. p  pEDIT3 Im done rewriting all of our builds in Gant, and even though its not perfect, it downsized our build files massively and made adding new project much more straightforward, so Id definetely recommand Gant to people not wanting to change their build philosophy and project structure, but just looking for a more convenient tool than ant. I might have a look into graddle andor Ivy one of those days.p  pEDIT2  After trying out Buildr, we ruled it out because it does way more things than what we actually need. Im now trying Gant which looks like right what we need but the documentation is pretty small. Is it worth it moving all the way to Gradle, or is th project not mature enough yet p  pEDIT  Ill try to clarify our problems with Ant. We have several subprojects with similar layouts which we have to compile and run tests for. Once thats done, some of them need to be packaged together to produce executables namely a client, a server, and some standalone demos. The work to descripe our standard layout in ant is pretty long, and its awfully difficult to introduce small variations without rewriting the whole macro. Say, one of the projects need to grab its visual assets from a different repository.p  ul lia hrefhttpgant.codehaus.org relnofollowGanta which would allow us to reuse the ant tasks that are already out there both for Flash and Javali lia hrefhttpwww.gradle.org relnofollowGradlea for the same reasons even though it looks slightly more complicatedli lia hrefhttprake.rubyforge.org relnofollowRakea which seems to be highly recommended. The downside being the experimental support of action script integration and our lack of knowledge of Rubyli lia hrefhttpbuildr.apache.org relnofollowBuildra which looks pretty cool, but here again, no knowldege of rubyli lia hrefhttpwww.scons.org relnofollowSconsa seems to have less momentum, but Python is a pretty cool scripting languageli ul  pMaven was considered, but has been eliminated because of the inherent complexity and the apparent errorproneness.

Of note could also be that we use Hudson to handle continuous integration.p

Arrays   can contain up to around 10,000   elements before they are put on the   large object heap and can cause   problems, so a very effective way to   store 100,000 entries might be to   store 10 arrays each containing 10,000   elements none will end up on the   large object heap so no fragmentation   will occur.

Negative 456 pIs it possible to setup two separate projects, 1 WebForms and 1 ASP.NET MVC, to both point to the same domain i.e. both point to different pages within www.somesite.com. p  pHeres some background on the application and why Im asking. This is a brownfield application that is currently 2.0 WebForms and is full of WebFormy goodness i.e. ObjectDataSources, FormView controls, UpdatePanels, etc... There are lost of other fun things in the code base like 600 Stored Procedures and 200 line methods in the business layer code that get data from the DB via stored proc, do some processing on the data, build an HTML string using string concatenation and then return that string to the UI layer. What we are planning on doing is developing new features in MVC and slowly converting the existing features over to MVC one at a time. As part of this transition, we will also be rewriting the layers below the UI to clean up the mess there and to do things like replace the stored procedures with NHibernate and introduce an IOC container.p  pI know that you can run WebForms and MVC sidebyside in the same project, however, because we will be making wholesale changes to the way we do many things throughout our entire development stack, Id like the new stuff to be a completely separate project within the solution. This should help serve as very visual reminder that this is a different way of doing things than before and make it easier to remove the old code as it is no longer needed. What I dont know is, is this even possible Can two separate project point to the same domainp  pHeres an quick example of what Im thinkingp  pwww.somesite.comorders.aspxid123 Orders page from existing WebForms project www.somesite.comcustomer987 Customer page from new MVC projectp

So my service accepts an array of enumerations for a given entity, then i use an extension method to translate that to a string used in the code.Includecode statement.p  pIm thinking the solution is to instead of accepting an array of enums, accept a generic classp  precodepublic ICollectionltTgt FindFruitltTgtFruitAssociationsltTgt assocs where T  Fruit codepre  pAnd use it like thisp  precodevar associations  new FruitAssociationsltOrangegtOrangeAssociations.OrangeFamilies var apples  fruitServices.FindFruitltApplegtassociations codepre  pBut im not sure how that would work, or how to implement it.p  pHopefully my question makes sense and is not too longcomplicated.p

Negative 456 pWe have a background process linux daemon in an infinite loop that automatically takes all lines from csv files that are placed in a certain directory and imports them into a table. The daemon processes any files that appear in the directory one by one, is written in python, and uses psycopg2 to connect to our postgresql database.p  pThat process imports those records using INSERT statements, but first DELETES any table records that have the same unique key as any of the records in the csv file. Generally the process is DELETING a record for every record it INSERTS. So as this daemon is running in the background it is DELETING and then INSERTING rows. Every time it processes one file it specifically commits the transaction, closes the cursor, and then closes the connection.p  pPeriodically twice a day we want to run CLUSTER to remove the dead tuples and keep the table to a manageable on disk size. p  pHowever, something in this process is stopping the CLUSTER command from removing the dead tuples for all the records that are being deleted as the process is running. We know this happening because if we run CLUSTER while the process is running, the on disk size of the table containing this imported data will not decrease and pgstatusertables will show many dead tuples.p  pIf we stop the process and then run CLUSTER, the on disk size of the table will decrease dramatically and and pgstatusertables will report that all of the dead tuples are gone.p  pWhats strange is we are committing the transaction and closing the connections every time we process each file, so I have no idea what is not allowing the dead tuples to be removed while the process is running.p  pAlso strange, is that if we stop the process, then start the process again, then do a CLUSTER, it will remove all of the dead tuples created by the empreviousem run of the daemon process but any subsequent calls of CLUSTER will not clear any dead tuples created by the emcurrentem run of the daemon process while it is still running of course.p  pSo emsomethingem is maintaining some kind of link to the dead tuples until the process is stopped, even though we have committed the transaction and closed all connections to postgres that created those dead tuples. pglocks does not report any open locks and no running transactions are reported, so it doesnt seem like its a lock or open transaction issue.p  pAt the end of the day, this is stopping us from periodically running CLUSTER on the table so that it doesnt keep growing and growing.p  pIm sure there is a simple answer to this, but I cant find it anywhere.  Some skeleton code for the process is below. It really is a simple process so I have no idea what is going on here.

But now, after adding timezone, rails is looking for a timezone.yml file for date conversion formats.p  pI dont see the real sense behind this.

Negative 456 pIm a Mac Xcode 3.2.2 user, working with the GCC 4.2 compiler, fairly inexperienced with C and completely ignorant about compilers.p  pI need to read in numbers from an external file and store them in a vector of ints. I wrote code using streams and getline. I can compile the code and it runs without errors, but there is no output. It works for a friend nonMac and nonGCC 4.2 compiler though.p  pI did some googling and found several posts about a possible compiler gcc, Apple issue in Xcode 3.2.1 that might relate to my problem this one, for example C using getline prints pointer being freed was not allocated in XCode.

Or if there is some other problem in my code.p  pIt would be great if someone could offer some advice. No advice is too simple.

Negative 456 pI have an iPhone application in Cocos2d that sometimes crashes on actual device, due to memory problems. p  pWhat I have so far found out is that the scenes, when switched, arent fully released  the code[retainCount]code for them is somewhat about 410  p  pThe codedealloccode method never gets called, and then I assume, when I switch the scenes a few times, the memory issue shows up. p  pIm wondering  where should I relese the scene Since it has number of children, I suppose I should be doing a cleanupremoval of them.

Negative 456 pI work at a company that uses ExtJS for our product.  The product currently over extends ExtJS components and overrides parent functionality.  This has made upgrade difficult at best.  We are keeping ExtJS but are looking into using it in a nonbastardized way.  There seem to be two camps.  In one camp the members think we should write an abstraction on top of ExtJS in case we decide to change frameworks in several years, hopefully that way we are less locked in.  I personally think thats a silly goal, so I sit in camp number two.  My reasoning is the ExtJS team has spent their time coming up with a reasonable abstraction for the webthey are in the domain to solve that problem, whereas we are merely trying to implement a cool product.  I think if we write an abstraction it will assume ExtJS.  I see us writing inferior abstractions that are less powerful and that wont map to the jQuery world or any other framework.  Opinions on the correct course of actionp
Negative 456 pI have two different databases that are not connected in any way.  In fact, one is a public school database and one is a hud housing database.  By law they are not allowed to share names and other specific identifying addresses.  Birthdates and addresses are okay  along with zip codes and other more general ids.  The uses need to be able to query the other database to get nonspecific information so it would appear that they need to share the same unique id.  I was considering such things as using birthdates and perhaps initials of name or perhaps last 4 digits of ssn along with the birthdate.  The client was thinking of global positioning data but Im concerned about apartments next to one another or moving of families.  Any ideasp

Negative 456 pWell I am a new to VB.NET, converting a legacy system to .NET world. Recently I have been reviewing the already existing code since I joined the project quite late in the team. p  pSo I find that there are many shared functions not shared class inside many classes. I doubt this may create some problem if two requests  i.e two different HTTP request to the same method as its a WCF application, of course exposed methods are not shared but internally called methods are shared comes to the same shared method and both the calls to the method may have different method parametersarguments, overwriting each others arguments.p  pIn short, if shared method has a list of arguments which is going to be processed, is there any chance of inconsistencies in the light of multiple access to the shared method via two http requests.p  pI would appreciate each and every response the thread.p  pThanks, JJp

Negative 456 pIm generating terrain in Opengl geometry shader and am having trouble calculating normals for lighting. Im generating the terrain dynamically each frame with a perlin noise function implemented in the geometry shader. Because of this, strongI need an efficient way to calculate normals pervertexstrong based on the noise function no texture or anything. I am able to take cross product of 2 side to get face normals, but they are generated dynamically with the geometry so I cannot then go back and smooth the face normals for vertex normals. How can I get vertex normals on the fly just using the noise function that generates the height of my terrain in the y plane therefore height being between 1 and 1. I believe I have to sample the noise function 4 times for each vertex, but I tried something like the following and it didnt work...p  precodevec3 xP1  vertex  vec31.0, 0.0, 0.0 vec3 xN1  vertex  vec31.0, 0.0, 0.0 vec3 zP1  vertex  vec30.0, 0.0, 1.0 vec3 zN1  vertex  vec30.0, 0.0, 1.0  float sx  snoisexP1  snoisexN1 float sz  snoisezP1  snoisezN1  vec3 n  vec3sx, 1.0, sz normalizen  return n codepre  pThe above actually generated lighting that moved around like perlin noise So any advice for how I can get the pervertex normals correctlyp

Negative 456 pIm working on a project where I have to build a graphical process modeler for a proprietary BPM business process management system made in java. Im mentioning that the software is proprietary because it does not follow ANY international standards like BPEL, BPMN, XPDL, and this is a vital information for any answers I may get.p  pMy intended approach is to use the eclipse GMF to create a standalone RCP application, similar to Bonita Studio, where business analysts will graphically model the business processes and deploy the process model into the web application.p  pThis application has an internal wizardlike process modeler, very rudimentary. But this modeler has a functionality to import and export models in a custom, well defined XML format, which is also proprietary and has no international standards.p  pWhat I need is to persist the graphical model created with the eclipse gmf rcp application Im developing into this custom XML format. This way I can simply invoque the import function in the web application and the process will be deployed. I also need to be able to do the reverse open a custom process in this XML format into my eclipse RCP and show it in a graphical manner.p  pSo, what I need isp  pstrongI need to save a graphical diagram in a custom XML format and open a custom XML file in this format and show it as graphical diagramsstrongp  pThank you very much for any helpp

Negative 456 pI am having an issue while comparing two images which are same. if the image sizes are same then can compare No issues, if sizes are different, then I am unable to compare.

Negative 456 pI currently have some image processing scripts I wrote in PHP which I use for CMS websites. One of them takes an source image which the client has uploaded, resizes it, writes out the processed image with a specific filename eg 100x100id240.jpg for a 100 x 100 thumbnail for page id 240 and most importantly  alters the timestamp on the new processed image to match the source image.p  pEach time the page is requested by the browser the php script checks the timestamp on both the source and processed image to make sure they match  if they dont then the client must have changed the source image so the processing is repeated and the new version overwrites 100x100id240.jpg. If the timestamps do match then we dont need to reprocess the images so we just use the already processes thumbnail.p  pThis works great. However, every now and then I get a client who uploads a pile of images with exactly the same timestamp, to 100th of a second. If then then alter the source image for a page to an alternate image with the same timestamp the php script go merrily on it way and compares the source images timestamp to the  processed image timestamp, finds the timestamps are the same and so do not reprocess the new source image. We then get an incorrect thumbnail output.p  pI have thought of perhaps writing a random timestamp to the source image on upload, which would solve the problem. But I would rather preserve this stamp. So I need another method which is not heavy on processing, like counting all the pixels in the source image which are red for example. I wondered if I could write a unique code to exif data or something. But exif is only for jpg right Any ideas on how to solve this Thanksp

Shouldnt Xcode know to either skip or include those  There is strongno indicationstrong in Xcode that there are any uncommitted files.  The only way to find them is from the command line.p  pOne thought would be to manually create a .gitignore file, but I would assume that Xcode handles all that internally.  p  pDid I just stumble onto a bug, or is there some standard step that Im missingp  pThanksp

Negative 456 pI having a application which has Windows Integrated Authentication, for internet users we are having a reverse proxy which has a IIS server which will authenticate using basic authentication then redirected to the actual application, every thing works as expected in IE and firefox but in safari there is a second login dialog box appers. When I did a packet capture using wireshark I noticed that in IE and FF the basic authetication which is carried forwared to the actual application from IIS server but in Safari there is a NTLM negotion in between because of this my application asks for one more login dialog.

Negative 456 pI am struggling with designing a codecoreDatacode model where I have only one type of entry called ToDo. Each ToDo entry has either 0, 1, 2, ... , or n relationships to other sub entries just like ToDo. So the relationships between the ToDo entries design a tree structure with an undefined number of child nodes. The following graphic should illustrate the case E  core data entryp  precode            E                                                                                                              E  E  E                                                                         E     E                                             E E E           codepre  pMy guess was to model that data like illustrated in the following graph.

Negative 456 pI have 3 tables Book, Section and Content. I want to add manytomany relation between Section and Content. Section and Content tables have a PageNo column. A Page may have many contents and many Sections. In Briefp  precodeBook 1 Section on BookId Book 1 Content on BookId Section  Content on PageNo codepre  pThe PageNo is not unique for both Section and Content tables. So I cant add foreign key for PageNo in Sql Server. p  pI tried to create a junction table like thisp  precodeSectionContent [SectionId, ContentId] codepre  pAnd I added FKs for this junction table. So entity framework could understand the junction table and it set up manytomany relationship on SectionId and ContentId. But everytime when I need to insert one of Section or Content Table, I have to insert to SectionContent junction table, too. So first I have to check if there is a same record already in the junction table. Also there are a lot of insert operations in the project. I have to search for all insert operations and I have to add extra query to insert into the junction table.p  pAlso I need get the sections and contents in a page. This is extra effort for me. p  pI can remove the relationship between Section and Content tables. And I can use extra join queries on PageNo column. But I want to use entity. I want to get Contents in entity way like Section.Contents and I want to get Sections in the same way like Content.Sections. p  pSo can I add manytomany association between Section and Content on PageNo column without SQL Servers FKsp  pEdit Also If I use the junction table above, I must execute an sql query like this, do Ip  precodeINSERT INTO SectionContent SELECT  FROM       SELECT Section.id AS SectionId, Content.id AS ContentId     FROM Section     LEFT OUTER JOIN Content         ON Section.PageNo  Content.PageNo AND             Section.BookId  Content.BookId       UNION      SELECT Section.id AS SectionId, Content.id AS ContentId     FROM Section     RIGHT OUTER JOIN Content         ON Section.PageNo  Content.PageNo AND             Section.BookId  Content.BookId   AS T WHERE SectionId is not NULL AND ContentID is not NULL GROUP BY T.SectionId, T.ContentId codepre

Negative 456 pI am looking to use my screen real estate to look at several simple lists side by side.

Realize, of course, that a list may have many different types of objects, though I will almost guarantee that my lists have the same structures feel free to insert NA or NULL if necessary to make things work or I can figure out how to wrangle that.p  pHere are three example lists that I would like to try to display side by sidep  precodel1 lt liste1  R, e2  liststatistics, visualization, e3  0 l2 lt liste1  Perl, e2  listtext processing, scripting, e3  0 l3 lt liste1  Matlab, e2  listnumerical computing, simulation, e3  cacademic  unknown, professional  unknown codepre  pIf you have a wide monitor, it looks like a waste to see these take up so much vertical room and so little room used on the horizontal access.  If these lists were just a little longer, I wouldnt be able to see more than 2 at a time, without reducing to a small font.p  pIf it makes it easier, the codee3code entries in codel1code and codel2code could be codeFOSScode, to match the character vectors of codel3e3code, but the real goal is a layout problem in the R console.p  pSome naive, interfacespecific solutions includep  ul liFire up multiple R instances, split screen using GNU codescreencode and codeCA codeli liLearn ESS, and let the miracle of Emacs solve everythingli liGo back and forth with another text editor e.g. Notepad and manually migrate blocks of textli ul  pThe nonnaive solutions that Im trying arep  ul liWrite these out to a text file.

I am using a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function in the hidden layers, and a sigmoid function for the output layer. I have divided the number of goals by 10, to give an output between 0 and 1.p  pBefore i began running this, i assumed that the NN would outperform simple statistical models, but it doesnt come close. My question isp  pFrom the results you can see, does it look like there is an error in the code somewhere  Do i need to make a change to the architecture of the network  Do i need to change the network inputstraining data in some way p  pIve been trying to identify the issue for a while now, and its driving me mental. Any adive is greatly appreciated.p  pMany Thanks.p
Negative 456 pIm using hibernate, Spring and Velocity in Java.p  pIm extending the SimpleFormController and using a typical User object for the command class.

I call it my UserEdit class. My problem there is that I cannot reference the User object variables without accessors in velocity template such as command.user.username , and I also cannot bind them for errors or use the User object to reflect and form changes back into the database.p  pMy question is in regards to how I can either user this UserEdit object in my form or otherwise make use of a different approach in order that my form can have User data and other data and at the same time be able to update the User objectwhich is reflected in hibernate.

Negative 456 pIve recently started using APC cache on our servers. One of the most important parts of our product is a CLI Cronscheduled process, whose performance is critical. Typically the batchjob consists of running some 1632 processes in parallel for about an hour they restart every few minutes.p  pBy default, using APC cache in CLI is a waste of time due to the opcode cache not being retained between individual calls. But APC also contains codeapcbindumpfilecode and codeapcloaddumpfilecode functions.p  pI was thinking these two function might be used to make APC efficient in CLI mode by having it all compiled sometime outside the batchjob, stored in a single dumpfile and having the individual processes load the dumpfile.p  pDoes anybody have any experience with such a scenario or can you give good reasons why it will or will not work If any significant gains could reasonably be had, either in memory use or performance What pitfalls are lurking in the shadowsp

Negative 456 pAs the title suggests, I have an app which uses Facebook connect to log users in. p  pOn the iPhone this works fine it switches to the Facebook app, logs in and then goes back to my app at the same place it left off.p  pHowever on an iPad I only have an iPad 1 to hand but Im presuming the problem is across all 3, when it returns to my app it seems to have restarted it entirely. It goes back to the splash screen, and then to the login screen. The user is stuck in an endless loop of unsuccessfully logging in, despite the fact that the Facebook app is logging in correctly.p  pDoes anyone have any idea why this could be happening on the iPad but not an iPhonep  pThis app is actually inherited from a much older app which was iPhone only,  and to simplify things it has essentially been left that way. The images etc are just scaled based on screen size, there is no differentiation in the code between iPhones and iPads other than their screen size. The facebook connect code has a FBIsDeviceIPad bool, but afaik that is just for setting the position and size of the popup login dialog when not using SSO.p  pEdit Further investigation suggests it could be an issue with OpenGL ES. The app crashes when sent to the background, as the OpenGl ES code carries on trying to animate etc. The facebook app momentarily puts my app into the background, ergo the app crashes and restarts. p  pIll update this once I find out how to fix this, in the meantime if anyone has already dealt with this situation I would welcome any suggestions.p

Since Ive been developing the next update to the map on a test server, facetClick is not part of this live version and I instead use its output function sideClick however the error is still the same in this arrangementp  precodeactive is null google.maps.event.triggeractive.gpolygons[poly],click codepre  pMap a hrefhttpwww.beloit.edumaps relnofollowhttpwww.beloit.edumapsap  pMap wAccessibility a hrefhttpwww.beloit.edumapsaccess relnofollowhttpwww.beloit.edumapsaccessap  pMap wBuilding Click a hrefhttpwww.beloit.edumapsmiddle relnofollowhttpwww.beloit.edumapsmiddleap  hr  pstrongEDITstrong Spent most of my day working on rebuilding the functionality of the parser in Javascript and, low and behold, without the parser it works just fine.  I figure that is obvious as I have to define each shape individually before the code, rather than waiting for it to be passed along by the parser.  It would seem the answer is if you want unique URLs, drop the parser. ltp

Negative 456 pI am currently working on speech recognition. I have to compare the signature of an unknow sound in term of frequencies with other signatures of sounds that we know.br Concretely, we determine the peaks formants in the spectrum of a sound, that are specific that caracterise to this sound. We memorize the frequencies of this peaks as tuples. We memorize the tuples of known sounds. There are thousands if not hundred of thousands of them.br For each new sound to identify, we compare the tuples of that sound to the tuples of the known sounds. That requires to make a lot of comparisons p  pI need to find a way to compare these tuples quickly.p  pI already looked up and I found that it is a strongNearest neighbor searchstrong problem. strongHowever I dont think that I can use theses algorithms.strongp  pIndeed, the tuples can have a different number of components. The components are just frequencies in kHz. It can be 1  2 or 1  2.4  4  5  6  7  7.1  11  12.1 13 up to 20 components.p  pstrongSo my question is strong I dont have a dataset with tuples of the same dimension, how can I find the nearest neighboor p  pIt is my understanding that in order to apply Nearest neighboor algorithms one has to have emtuples of the same dimensionem. p  pThanks for reading me.br Have a nice dayp  pstrongEDITstrongbr I dont just need to find strongthestrong closest neighboors, I actually need to find strongallstrong the neighbooring points that are distant by less than a distance D to my reference point.p  pstrongEDIT2strongbr randomhacker No they dont. You can compare an element of the tuple with an element of another tuple, only if the difference between these two elements is lt threshold. p  pstrongEDIT3strongbr Youre absolutly right mathias, I just typed something random. In fact the elements of a tuple are frequencies sorted ascending and indeed each frequency of a tuple only appears once. So 4  2 is wrong, it should be 2  4 and 2  2  4 doesnt exist, its 24 no repeatp

Negative 456 pHello android developers,p  pI am developing a simple game for Android in Eclipse using OpenGLES 1.0. I am using Samsung Galaxy S2 Android2.3 as a device for development.p  pAnd I have a question about dual core and making frame rate constant.p  pSo I have managed creating GLSurfaceView and override onDrawFrame function where I call LogicUpdatedeltatime function and Render function.p  pYes, all in single thread for now.p  pThe problem I am getting is with dual core. If I disable dual core by going to SettingPower saving and check System power saving I realize that rendering is automatically locked at 30 FPS. But if I enable dual core by unchecking System power saving I see that rendering is locked at 60 FPS but, phone gets hot and it drains battery really fast.p  pSo the idea is keep my game run at 30 FPS to save some battery.p  pSo to do this I use the code bellow.p  pBefore I do logic update I call this peace of code, remember all this is done in onDrawFrame.p  precodeif CONSTFPS gt 0 ampamp StartTime gt 0                        Get frame time          long endTime   System.currentTimeMillis      long time      endTime  StartTime                        long wantedtime  1000  CONSTFPS          long wait  0     if time lt wantedtime               wait  wantedtime  time                                    Thread.sleepwait          else              Time to big game will slow down                                  codepre  pWhere CONSTFPS  30p  pAnd thenp  precodeStartTime  System.currentTimeMillis   UpdateLogic1.0  CONSTFPS Render codepre  pGameplay at 30 FPS is very smooth mainly because it does not need to lock FPS. BUT, when trying to lock 60FPS to 30 FPS I get stuttering. I did some research and found out that Thread.Sleep is not precise. Is this true What else can I do to make gameplay more smooth when locking 60FPS to 30FPS.p  pThanks for the answer ...p

Negative 456 pThis may be subjective, but I wanted to give it a go anyway so that I didnt have to use up peoples time as much and use my time waiting for an answer. This is about how I can apply better research when Google fails with my methods. I get stuck on certain concepts and dont know how to understand them. I researched all the links recommended in a post earlier today intensely and learned a LOT but still am stuck. p  pFor instance, my book reads  Each process has its own memory space, separate from the space belonging to other processes I dont know what this own memory space is and what it contains I know that it might contain what I know makes up or represents a process explained a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiProcess28computing29Representation relnofollowherea. p  pI dont know much about it, so I tried looking up process memory space on SO and on Google. On SO, I saw an application question in C and other languages having to do with what they termed process memory space stuff on Process address space and virtual memory, process memory space is. On Google I found application stuff only. My question is, how with an example for process memory space could I better figure out what to research that talks about what process memory spacep
Negative 456 pI wish to understand how does a parser work. I learnt about the LL, LR0, LR1 parts, how to build, NFA, DFA, parse tables, etc.p  pNow the problem is, i know that a lexer should extract tokens only on the parser demand in some situation, when its not possible to extract all the tokens in one separated pass. I dont exactly understand this kind of situation, so im open to any explanation about this.p  pThe question now is, how should a lexer does its job  should it base its recognition on the current contexts, the current nonterminals supposed to be parsed  is it something totally different  What about the GLR parsing  is it another case where a lexer could try different terminals, or is it only a syntactic business  I would also want to understand what its related to, for example is it related to the kind of parsing technique LL, LR, etc or only the grammar p  pThanks a lotp

So I have a few questionsp  ol liWhy should I usenot use this approachli liHow is this setup Not specifically for Ditz, but for any files. li liHow does it work daytodayli ol  pI have almost no experience with branching and everywhere I look it is used to keep an edited copy of trunk that will be merged later.

The following apply to subversion.p  pFrom the svnbook,p  blockquote   pSubversion has no internal concept of a branchonly copiesp blockquote  pwhich maybe means that svn branches are not exactly what is suggested in the ditz readme.

Negative 456 pIm trying to come up with a regex searchreplace to encapsulate variables eg codefoocode with braces eg codefoocode. I came up with the following regex, but its not working as intendedp  precodes[][azAZ09][]123g codepre  pHowever, I have some problems with this pattern. It will only do one pattern per quoted string. This is OK, since I can run the expression multiple times on the file but it doesnt handle variables already encapsulated in braces. It just puts a second set of braces on them.p  pMy idea now is to strip code2code of braces, but I dont think this will work since the pattern will still match and it will only perform 1 substitution per quoted string. I looked at backreference expression documentation but Im not able to determine a better approach.p

Negative 456 pI wrote a rest service using jersey 1.13 and spring 3.1.1 which runs on tomcat 6. In tomcat Im using a realm which will do the authentication. In my application I need the current user but I dont want to access the SecurityContext from jersey in every resource. I want to inject a request scoped ApplicationConfig object in my rest resources which will contain the current user. Later I can extend this class to contain more request level configuration parameteters.

Negative 456 pA database table is used to store editing changes to a text document.p  pThe database table has four columns codeidcode, codetimestampcode, codeuseridcode, codetextcodep  pA new row is added to the table each time a user edits the document.  The new row has an autoincremented id, and a timestamp matching the time the data was saved.p  pTo determine what editing changes a user made during a particular edit, the codetextcode from the row inserted in response to his or her edit is compared to the codetextcode in the previously inserted row.p  pTo determine which row is the previously inserted row, either the codeidcode column or the codetimestampcode column could be used.  As far as I can see, each method has advantages and disadvantages.p  pstrongDetermining the creation order using codeidcodestrongp  ul lipAdvantage Immune to problems resulting from incorrectly set system clock.pli lipDisadvantage Seems to be an abuse of the codeidcode column since it prescribes meaning other than identity to the codeidcode column.  An administrator might change the values of a set of ids for whatever reason eg. during a data migration, since it ought not matter what the values are so long as they are unique.  Then the creation order of rows could no longer be determined.pli ul  pstrongDetermining the creation order using codetimestampcodestrongp  ul liAdvantage The codeidcode column is used for identity only, and the codetimestampcode is used for time, as it ought to be.li liDisadvantage This method is only reliable if the system clock is known to have been correctly set each time a row was inserted into the table.  How could one be convinced that the system clock was correctly set for each insert  And how could the state of the table be fixed if ever it was discovered that the system clock was incorrectly set for a not precisely known period in the pastli ul  pI seek a strong argument for choosing one method over the other, or a description of another method that is better than the two I am considering.p

Negative 456 pI am building a script that generates input data [parameters] for another program to calculate. I would like to optimize the resulting data.

Is there anything out there that either does this, is there a simpler way, or any suggestions to get startedp  pSo the primary question is the following Is there an algorithm that takes a starting guess, generates multiple guesses, then uses those multiple guesses to create a new guess, and repeats until a threshold is found. Only analytic derivatives are available. What is a good way of going about this, is there something built already that does this, is there other optionsp  pThank you for your time.p  pAs a small update I do have this working by calculating simple parabolas through the three points of each dimension and then using the minima as the next guess. This seems to work decently, but is not optimal. I am still looking for additional options.p  pCurrent best implementation is parallelizing the inner loop of powells method.p  pThank you everyone for your comments. Unfortunately it looks like there is simply not a concise answer to this particular problem. If I get around to implementing something that does this I will paste it here however, as the project is not particularly important or the need of results pressing I will likely be content letting it take up a node for awhile.p

Negative 456 pI need to create a figure in a file without displaying it within IPython notebook. I am not clear on the interaction between codeIPythoncode and codematplotlib.pylabcode in this regard.

I can put the cycle in the thread but then i wont be able to stop it, and of course this control is needed during the whole time of running the program. p  precodePrivate Sub MakeScreenDoWorkByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.ComponentModel.DoWorkEventArgs Handles MakeScreen.DoWork         Dim screen1 As String         Dim prcs As String          Do Until screen1  1 Or prcs  1             Dim request As System.Net.HttpWebRequest  System.Net.HttpWebRequest.Createhttpmysitecmdcmd.txt             Dim response As System.Net.HttpWebResponse  request.GetResponse              Dim sr As System.IO.StreamReader  New System.IO.StreamReaderresponse.GetResponseStream              screen1  sr.ReadLine             prcs  sr.ReadLine          Loop          Screenshot section           If screen1  1 Then              Try                 Do While ssCount lt 1                 Dim bounds As Rectangle                 Dim screenshot As System.Drawing.Bitmap                 Dim graph As Graphics                 bounds  Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds                 screenshot  New System.Drawing.Bitmapbounds.Width, bounds.Height, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb                 graph  Graphics.FromImagescreenshot                 graph.CopyFromScreenbounds.X, bounds.Y, 0, 0, bounds.Size, CopyPixelOperation.SourceCopy                 PictureBox1.Image  screenshot                 PictureBox1.Image.SaveCWindows  reqss  reqss.ToString  .png, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Png                  File.SetAttributesCWindows  reqss  reqss.ToString  .png, attribute                     Try                 My.Computer.Network.UploadFileCWindows amp reqss amp reqss amp .png, ftpmysite amp ThisHWID amp  amp ss amp reqss.ToString   amp lblMatch.Text amp  amp TimeOfDay.TimeOfDay.ToString amp .png, username, pass                  Dim request As System.Net.FtpWebRequest  DirectCastSystem.Net.WebRequest.Createfrpmysite amp ThisHWID amp  amp ss amp reqss.ToString   amp lblMatch.Text amp  amp TimeOfDay.TimeOfDay.ToString amp .png, System.Net.FtpWebRequest                 request.Credentials  New System.Net.NetworkCredentialusername, pass                 request.Method  System.Net.WebRequestMethods.Ftp.UploadFile                  Dim file As Byte  System.IO.File.ReadAllBytesCWindows amp reqss amp reqss amp .png                  Dim strz As System.IO.Stream  request.GetRequestStream                 strz.Writefile, 0, file.Length                 strz.Close                 strz.Dispose                   Catch ex As Exception                     MsgBoxex.Message                 End Try                  reqss  reqss  1             MakeScreen.Dispose             MakeScreen.RunWorkerAsync                 Loop             Catch ex As Exception                 Nothing             End Try         End If           End of section            Processes section      If prcs  1 Then                   reqprcs.Clear         Dim pProcess As Process  System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcesses         For Each p As Process In pProcess             Try                 ProcessList.Items.Addp.ProcessName                 ListBox1.Items.Addp.MainModule.FileName                 reqprcs.Addp.MainModule.FileName             Catch ex As Exception              End Try         Next                     Try              Dim W2 As New StreamWriterCWindowsrqprcs amp reqprcscount amp .txt             For i  0 To reqprcs.Count  1                 W2.WriteLinereqprcs.Itemi             Next             W2.Close             File.SetAttributesCWindows0beforegame.txt, FileAttributes.ReadOnly   read only             File.SetAttributesCWindowsrqprcs amp reqprcscount amp .txt, FileAttributes.Hidden                Try                 My.Computer.Network.UploadFileCWindowsrqprcs amp reqprcscount amp .txt, ftpmysite amp ThisHWID amp rqprcs amp reqprcscount amp  amp lblMatch.Text amp  amp TimeOfDay.TimeOfDay.ToString amp .txt, user, pass                  Dim request As System.Net.FtpWebRequest  DirectCastSystem.Net.WebRequest.Createftpmysite amp ThisHWID amp rqprcs amp reqprcscount amp  amp lblMatch.Text amp  amp TimeOfDay.TimeOfDay.ToString amp .txt, System.Net.FtpWebRequest                 request.Credentials  New System.Net.NetworkCredentialuser, pass                 request.Method  System.Net.WebRequestMethods.Ftp.UploadFile                  Dim file As Byte  System.IO.File.ReadAllBytesCWindowsrqprcs amp reqprcscount amp .txt                  Dim strz As System.IO.Stream  request.GetRequestStream                 strz.Writefile, 0, file.Length                 strz.Close                 strz.Dispose                  reqprcscount  reqprcscount  1                  MakeScreen.Dispose                 MakeScreen.RunWorkerAsync             Catch ex As Exception                 MsgBoxex.Message             End Try          Catch ex As Exception          End Try     End If      End of section   End Sub codepre

Negative 456 pI am looking for a general pattern to factor out some common code I need to implement algebra addition and subtraction between classes which have different properties with different arithmetics. One classic case is an interval which can be expressed in seconds, hours and minutes, which I have implemented with a class with three int properties. p  pFor example, if I want to subtract to a period of 0 seconds, 0 minutes and 1 hour a period of 0 seconds, 30 minutes, 0 hours, I dont want to obtain a period of 0 seconds, 30 minutes, 1 hour. p  pI would need to code the add and subtract between the two time interval, is there any common pattern to code this algebra  Should I look for a different representationp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI have oversimplified the question, because my use case typically applies to periods of time expressed in years, month, days and combination of them. The difficulty is that the user thinks in terms of days, month, years and there is not an exact conversion possible how many days have a month well...that variesp  pSo the user knows he will want to compute something in 6M 3 days, and when the computation will occur I will apply that interval to a reference date, getting the right result. I have no way to transform 6M 3D in an a total amount of days, because that depends on which reference date you select, and this will vary over time.p

Im very happy with this approach.p  pHowever, for attributes in objects the problem is much harder.

When I query the web service like thisp  precodeapi.marketplace.commerchantid1234 codepre  pIll get back the response in JSON which consists of two main pieces of datap  ol liThe number of products sold by Merchant 1234 strongtotalproductsstrongli liThe list array of the products sold stronglistproductstrong. Each element in this array represents one distinct Product object with two fields strongproductidstrong and strongproductnamestrong respectively.li ol  pSo if strongtotalproducts  934strong, therell be 934 elements in the array. When I put it in codes, my derived DataProvider looks like thisp  precodeclass ProductDataProvider extends CDataProvider  or should I extend other better class       public function constructconfig  array      foreachconfig as keygtvalue         thisgtkeyvalue               protected function fetchData          request  api.marketplace.commerchantid1234         response  retrieveProductsAndProcessJSONResponseIntoAppropriateDataStructurerequest         thisgtsetTotalItemCountresponsegttotalproducts          ifpaginationthisgtgetPaginationfalse             paginationgtsetItemCountthisgtgetTotalItemCount          return responsegtlistproducts           protected function calculateTotalItemCount          return thisgtgetTotalItemCount       codepre  pMy modelp  precodeclass Product extends CModel      public productid     public productname      public function display          return new ProductDataProviderarray             paginationgtarray                 pageSizegt10,                codepre  pand my Viewp  precodethisgtwidgetzii.widgets.grid.CGridView, array     idgtproductgrid,     dataProvidergtmodelgtdisplay,     columnsgtarray         productid,         productname,     ,  codepre  pThis works well with pagination and all that. However retrieving all 934 products is taking a bit too long. We can do this to the web service. p  precodeapi.marketplace.commerchantid1234amppagesize10amppageno1 codepre  pThis will only retrieve the first 10 records. We can play around with the query string variable strongpagenostrong to retrieve subsequent pages of products in groups of 10. The strongtotalproductsstrong returned from the web service will still be 934.p  pSo my question is, how do I put this into play so that the codeProductDataProvidercode only retrieves 10 product at any one time and load it into CGridView The CGridView will have to know that there are a total of 934 products to enable pagination. User browsing to other pages of the CGridView will trigger the ProductDataProvider to retrieve the next 10 records corresponding to the page number being viewed. I hope that my long winded question is comprehensible.p

Negative 456 pI am drawing a lot of circles for my android game which uses OpenGL ES 1.1. I use codeglColorPointer4, GL10.GLFLOAT, 0, vertexColorscode to give these circles nice radial gradients.p  pThese circles fadein and fadeout smoothly, so I some how need to set the alpha value for the whole circle.p  pNow, I tried codeglColor4f1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, opacitycode but it didnt work. As I discovered in my reserch, codeglColorPointercode ignores codeglColor4fcode calls and unlike textures, codeglColor4fcode does not modulate the gradient.p  pSecond option is to change the codeFloatBuffer vertexColorscode which is easy enoughp  precodefor int i  3 i lt vertexColors.capacity i  i  4      vertexColors.puti, opacity  codepre  pNow, my circles have 129 vertices each, and there will be 100150 circles all fading in and fading out, codevertexColors.putcode will be called approximately strong15,000 times per game loopstrong and strong375,000 times per second in 25fpsstrong and I have heard codeFloatBuffer.putint index, float fcode is expensive. So, this adds a significant overhead.p  pSo my question is,p  pCan I in any way set a global alpha value in OpenGL ES 1.1 I know codeglBlendColorcode in ES 2.0 can do a lot more but its not available in 1.1p  por,p  pCan I some how change the transparency of my circle without changing the vertex colors stored in the codeFloatBuffercodep  por,p  pWhat would be the most efficient way to fadein and fadeout circles which are colored using codeglColorPointercodep

Now this relativelayout has a background that his 800x500 and so it takes this 500 height pixel as his height, so i have to crop it giving something like 150dp as height rule, to accomodate the two textview without wasting way more space than needed.p  pHow can i use that background, but making the height of the relativeLayout a real wrapcontent p  precode ltRelativeLayout         androidididmid         androidlayoutbelowidtop         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheight130dp if i have wrapcontent here it take 500px as height          androidlayoutmarginLeft10dp         androidlayoutmarginRight10dp         androidlayoutmarginBottom5dp         androidpaddingLeft10dp         androidbackgrounddrawablecounterbackground2  800x500gt              ltTextView                 androidididCounterMechanicsTitle                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue                 androidlayoutmarginTop10dp                 androidtextSize30dp                 androidtextstringmechanics gt              ltTextView                 androidididCounterMechanics                 androidlayoutwidthfillparent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidlayoutbelowidCounterMechanicsTitle                 androidlayoutmarginTop5dp                 androidtextSize20dp                 androidtextstringmechanics gt          ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre

Negative 456 pI have a system that needs to show a business their list of their employees who can log into the system. So I need to get a List of MembershipUsers by ID. Is that possible All I see is the GetAllUsers method for Membership, but I really dont think that will work. There will be thousands of users, as each business will have their own list of employees, but I will only be needing a small segment of that each time probably around 40 per business.  It seems an awful waste of processing to bring back thousands of rows just to query that for a particular subset again. However, looping through and getting each one individually is taking up to 8 seconds My current code is belowp  precode       foreach int userAccountID in ListOfEmployeeIDs                     MembershipUser membershipUser  Membership.GetUseruserAccountId             if membershipUser  null                              dto.Username  membershipUser.UserName                 dto.Email  membershipUser.Email                 dto.Password  membershipUser.GetPassword                           Include Users Roles             dto.Roles  Roles.GetRolesForUserdto.Username         codepre  pIs there ANYTHING that will allow me to get all the Users I need in one fell swoop I need roles too Am I missing something obvious It would seem like a logical method to include in the Membership class. p  pIf there is absolutely no way to grab all the particular users I need at once, can anyone tell me some way to grab them quickly Is my loop doing something wrong to make it take so long to get the Usersp  pThanksp

Negative 456 pI currently have an app that has five components.

Negative 456 pI recently converted a mingwcygwin build to a Visual C cl.exe build and upon initial testing found it crashes at launch. I then installed it in my developer environment to debug it, under which it runs just fine.

Negative 456 pI have been struggling for quite a few days trying to understand why my OpenGL ES 2.0 application on Android is choppy.  The frames per second are quite high, generally staying at a consistent 60fps, however the game does not appear to be smooth.  After ruling out simple issues such as my timestep the same application runs fine using OpenGL ES 1.0 and overloading the math and frames the application has been reduced to a simple rotating triangle I came across the OpenGL Trace.p  pI cannot find any information explaining exactly what is going on with the OpenGL Trace.  So I am a bit in the dark here, but I am seeing strange behavior such as the glClear mask  256 function taking 2,533,190 nanoseconds of wall time and only 61,040 nanoseconds in thread time.  This will happen once, then everything will be normal for a few frames.p  pAnother example is glDrawElements.  274,684 nanoseconds wall time, 61,040 thread time.p  pThis possibly suggests to me, with my trial and error approach to understanding any of the information in the Trace, that there is something going on under the hood that is causing the slowdown.p  pWhat does it actually suggest  Standard or strange behavior  If strange what are some of the causes of that behaviorp  pAnd if you would be so kind, can anyone point me to information so that I may understand what I am looking at in the Trace.p  pIm doing my very best, and would love to be able to get back to work on my application.

Nested extensions is one of them a hrefhttpwww.indelible.orginkprotobufpolymorphism relnofollowhttpwww.indelible.orginkprotobufpolymorphismap  pHere what is interesting is how to read a serialized file. We have to create a Map to correspond the Animal.type to its extension identifier in order to cast an animal into a correct Dog or Cat.

Negative 456 pI know the question isnt very clear, I will try to explain, cant provide code because most of the variables are written in my language so you wouldnt be able to understand them.p  pIm writing a simple software that maintains a list of cars, their owners and repairs made on the carsIve developed 3 separate classes for cars, owners, and repairs. Important info is that each car has an attribute which is a list of repairs done to it, and my idea was as follows I made a form which allows you to enter relevant data about the owner and the car and containing a checkbox saying Has repairs, and a button to add a new object to the list. When I click this button, it checks the status of the checkbox, if it is checked, a new form opens whose constructor receives references to a list and a car containing 2 buttons, 1 to exit the form, the other one to add repairs to the said list. But what happens is, I click the button, and it adds the car while the other form is still in the air, not doing what I need it to do, since the car is already in the list.p  pTo be clear, I need a way to make the code execution stop when I enter this new form, and resume when I leave it. Any help would be welcomep

Negative 456 pIm having what appears to be a caching problem when using devmem with mmap on a dual ARM processor system Xilinx Zynq, to be exact.  My configuration is asymmettric, with one processor running Linux and the other processor running a bare metal application.  They communicate through a block of RAM that isnt in the Linux virtual memory space it was excluded by the devicetree file.   When my userspace Linux application writes to memory using the pointer returned from mmap, it can take anywhere from 100 ms to well over a second for the second processor to detect the changed memory content.  p  pOn the open call to devmem, I tried to specify ORDRW, OSYNC, and ODIRECT, but the ODIRECT caused the open to fail, so I removed ODIRECT.  I thought OSYNC should have guaranteed that data was written to memory before the write call returned, but Im using a memory pointer instead of writing through write.  I dont see any parameters on the mmap call that would seem to address caching issues.p  pIve tried calling fsyncfd and fdatasync after writing to memory, but that didnt change the behavior.p  pWhat DID seem to work was spawning this command immediately after the memory write      sync  echo 3 procsysvmdropcachesp  pWhat is the simplest way to get writes via a mapped memory pointer to flush immediatelyp

Negative 456 pI understand that printf can mask the racecondition in the code. However, I dont understand why syslog cannot mask it. People say that syslog resembles close to the release build. We have three build variants  debug  serial debugging  syslog enabled, production  syslog enabled, and release build  no serial debugging and no syslog enabled. People say try production that is enable syslog only to debug the issue. I couldnt understand why syslog will not mask the racecondition. Can somebody please explainp

Negative 456 pIve been working with WPF for a little while now and Ive had trouble forcing only one instance of a window to open from my MainWindow. Ive been trying to find out if the solution I chose is the best one but there does not seem to be a lot in the way of this subject. Makes me wonder if I am going about it entirely the wrong way.p  pThe original problem I was trying to solve was only allow one instance of a window to open, which I accomplished using a singleton model. It ended up working just fine, but I have two windows I want to open that Id like this functionality on. I figured it would be nice to make a BaseWindow to inherit from, so Id only need to implement this once. Thats where I got stuck.p  pIve created a very simple project where I am trying to implement this idea, but instead I am getting hit with a protectional level error on the AboutWindows public contructor, because the WindowBase contructor is private. Changing it to public allows the program to compile, but it seems to skip the AboutWindow contructor which has InitializeComponent.p  pHowever as a side note, the portion that allows only one instance is indeed working. If I can get constructor with IniliatizeCompotent to work Ill be set. To clarify, any windows that derive from WindowBase can be open at the same time. So in this case, one OptionWindow at a time and one AboutWindow.p  pMainWindow.xamlp  precodeltWindow xClassWpfApplication1.MainWindow         xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation         xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml         TitleMainWindow Height181 Width259gt     ltDockPanelgt         ltMenu DockPanel.DockTopgt             ltMenuItem HeaderFilegtltMenuItemgt             ltMenuItem HeaderToolsgt                 ltMenuItem HeaderOptions gtltMenuItemgt             ltMenuItemgt             ltMenuItem HeaderHelpgt                 ltMenuItem HeaderAbout ClickAboutMenuItemClickgtltMenuItemgt             ltMenuItemgt         ltMenugt         ltGridgt             ltTextBlock TextContent would go heregtltTextBlockgt         ltGridgt     ltDockPanelgt ltWindowgt codepre  pMainWindow.xaml.csp  precodeusing System.Windows  namespace WpfApplication1      public partial class MainWindow  Window          public MainWindow              InitializeComponent                   private void AboutMenuItemClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              AboutWindow.Instance.Show                codepre  pAboutWindow.xamlp  precodeltsrcWindowBase xClassWpfApplication1.AboutWindow         xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation         xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml         xmlnssrcclrnamespaceWpfApplication1         TitleAboutWindow Height300 Width300gt     ltGridgt         ltLabel ContentLabel HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin84,74,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt     ltGridgt ltsrcWindowBasegt codepre  pAboutWindow.xaml.csp  precodenamespace WpfApplication1       ltsummarygt      Interaction logic for AboutWindow.xaml      ltsummarygt     public partial class AboutWindow  WindowBase          public AboutWindow              InitializeComponent                codepre  pWindowBase.csp  precodeusing System using System.Windows  namespace WpfApplication1      public partial class WindowBase  Window          private static WindowBase instance          static WindowBase                     private WindowBase              Closed  AbstractWindowClosed                   public static WindowBase Instance              get                  if instance  null                      instance  new WindowBase                  return instance                                private void AbstractWindowClosedobject sender, EventArgs e              instance  null                codepre  pWhat exactly is the missing piece of the puzzle or am I going about this the wrong wayp

Negative 456 pI am currently thinking of how to design my invoice entity.  Specifically when it comes to the invoice amount.p  pThese are the options I have in mind, what pros and cons do you seep  ol liThe invoice entity does not hold the amount itself, instead it holds a virtual list with all the transactions related to the invoice and the amount is calculated and presented through those. InvoiceId as a foreign key.li liThe invoice entity does hold the amount and the transactions listas a safety insurance I assume, still InvoiceId as the foreign key.li liThe transactions entity does not contain a foreign key. Instead the amount is calculated from the transactions and stored in the invoice table. With some other reference to the corresponding invoice.li ol  p Currently I am using option number 1. But when I think about the future I realize that my transactions table will contain a lot of transactions. And at some point I might want to move those to increase the performance, without necessarily movingdroping the invoice table. So number 3 would be my choice here. But, are there any other option that would be preferedp

Negative 456 pI have a windows 8.1 XAML application. I want to allow users to customize the theme of the app themselves  for example, I want to give them a color picker where they can set various colors in the app, which would set various resources used across my app.p  pThe issue though, is I cant find out how to dynamically change the value of a resource. I know in 8.1 they added the concept of a theme resource, which allows me to change from light to dark theme at runtime and what not. But my issue is that Id like to say the backgroundColor resource is now going to be orange, and all items using this resource will reflect this changep  pI believe the DynamicResource XAML element is what I needed, but that seems to be from WPF and not supported in Win8. Does anyone have suggestionsp  pIn short  I want to be able to easily provide dynamic resource brushes.p
Negative 456 pIm working on a gradle build which builds several war files and publishes them to the local maven repo. In another project I want gradle to deploy all the new war files to a tomcat server and then run webetsts against them.

I would think that since I added the war files as dependencies that the cargo plugin would just know about them but it doesnt seem to work that way. p

Negative 456 pin a project we are working on we let the user choose the pictures for his menu as well as the hover state picture for each menu. Right now the menu consists from x amount of codedivcode tags, based on the user selection we set the style of the div in order to apply the image as background and on codemouseovercode and codeonmouseoutcode we change the style attribute.p  pHowever this results in image flickering which is not ideal. What I would like is a result like a sprite hover with css, but in this case I dont know how to achieve or approach something like this.

Negative 456 pIve seen Objective C code using a collection of practices, raging from passing a pointer of NSError for execution finish status  to using NSAssert  to implementing throw  to relaying on delegate for status code returned in the callback  to the old c method of returning a booleanint indicating with 1 being success and co.p  pI cant identify a consistent pattern for how should I be handling errors happening in my app running on client devices. For ex, what would you recommend handling for the following casesp  ul liClient attempt to access a network resource, network resource timed out  returned 500li liUnexpected state that should have not even happened reached in logical code sectionli liAttempt to write to disk failed Out of disk space, not permission and codeli ul  pComing from Java, server side practices exceptions the weapon of choice, using Objective C and C is seems that exceptions exist but are not encouraged. NSAssert seems harsh, as it will crash the application, which in most cases is not the optimal solution. So, Id appreciate a Best practices advice. p

Negative 456 pIm fairly new to WPF and Ive got a pretty good feel for binding, but Im not real comfortable with the markup.

Negative 456 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have a software component that writes data to a postgres database into several tables and I want to write an automatic functional test for this component. I already have a host of unit tests in place that check the subcomponents, but Id like a test that checks the whole system endtoend.p  pFor each test run, I use a clean database actually a completely new, thistestrunonly database. The software component is stable in the sense that given the same input, it will always write the same user data to the database.p  pThe database design is relational, such that most tables contain foreign keys. Obviously, I dont want to check the value of these keys, because I dont want to rely on the fact that these keys are generated in a predictive manner by postgres.p  pAssume that there are no issues regarding user rights on the database, connection issues etc. Also disregard developmentproduction disparities.p  pI currently use a number of codeselectcode statements to produce a textual dump of the database and compare it to a reference dump ignoring whitespace and so on, but this seems rather clumsy. Also, this doesnt take into account the relationships between the tables. Extending the current approach to deal with this doesnt strike me as maintainable at all, should the database layout ever change.p  pMy software as well as the testing framework is written in C, the testing scripts are simple bash scripts. Im open to use any language to achieve this.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow can I automatically verify the database contents in the database wayp  pEven better would be an approach that doesnt rely on postgres as the backend.p

Negative 456 pI have to admit this has always confused me how certain windows API accept strings. Take for example a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms63354628vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowSetWindowTexta. Now any function which takes a pointer to anything typically means it doesnt store that object but merely use the pointer that is passed. Therefore the caller has the responsibility to make sure the object passed to it exist for whenever it may be needed. Now what would you expect the final message that will be printed out belowp  precodeTCHAR  label  new TCHAR[50] tcscpy label, Tallocated string  mwndStaticLabel.SetWindowText label  tcscpy label, Tstring has changed  codepre  pTheoretically I would expect it to print string has changed but it prints allocated string. Similarlyp  precodeCString label  TCString Label mwndStaticLabel.SetWindowText label  codepre  pIn this case a pointer of a local variable label is being passed to it but still no problem. The control always prints the right string even though it received pointer of string allocated on stack. p  pThis implies that the control actually allocate its own memory and assign that to the control instead of the pointer we are passing but this fact is never documented. Isnt this a little misleading When I am passing a pointer to a function, one thing I immediately remind myself is I shouldnt be destroying it until the function returns but it is not the case in this case and it is not documented either.p  pSo my question ultimately is this simply lack of documentation or there is something else to it  when we passing a pointer to an object but it essentially behaves like we have passed object by valuep

Negative 456 pI realize a similar Q was asked 5 years ago. Im hoping there may be a better answer today.p  pstrongIs there a programmatic way to tell a browser to expire its cached version of this page amp to request a refresh from the server, next timestrong Time based expiry is not fast enough.p  pstrongRequirementstrong      I want the client to constantly reload the the page from its own cache, until I tell it via SignalR that the page is obsolete. Then if I could flush justthatpage from the local cache, the next time the user looked at it, it would pull the latest version from the server. So once more it would be cached locally.p  pstrongWhystrong      The data on the page takes a long time to download amp the javascript adds seconds to the render time. Often it remains static for 30 mins or more. But occasionally it changes a few times a minute. So a fixed time interval cache, doesnt work. p  pASP MVC lets me invalidate the Output cache of a page on the server. Which is great. If I could do the same on the client it would be an awesome speed improvement. p  pNote Im not changing the CSS, Images or Javascript. I just want strip out a lot of JScript amp to do most of the HTML rendering on the server, once per data change event. p

Negative 456 pI recently found a custom UI element in an EPGApplication, and Im wondering how I can achieve something similar.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comShUpx.png altenter image description herep  pBasically With this uielement you can pick a time. It only shows full and half hours, but you can choose 5minutes intervalls while vertical swipe at the whole screen. If you choose a time, the application updates the UI depending on the chosen time. p  pThis UIElement is located at the top of a codeListViewcode. Vertical swipes let you scroll in the list, horizontal swipes at the whole screen changes the value of the time. p  pI want to implement something similar, but I have absolutely no idea, where to start.

Negative 456 pIm trying to figure out easiest way to perform the followingp  pI have a Category Model, a Product Model with a Category ForeignKey, and a ProductFeature EAVstyle table referencing a product ForeignKey, a Feature ForeignKey, and a value column. So quick outline of the modelsrelations involvedp  ul lipCategory pli lipFeature.namepli lipFeature.defaultvaluepli lipProduct.category  Categorypli lipProductFeature.product  Productpli liProductFeature.feature  Featureli liProductFeature.valueli ul  pI would like something like the following experience in Django admin panelp  pUser creates a new Product via admin app. On the Add new Product page, he can choose a category already have this with the default Django foreignkey drop down, And then based on the category he chooses, a set of ProductFeature columns should be automatically created and shown, populated with the defaultvalue for those Features.  I already have a display for all the associated ProductFeature columns on the Product Page using djangos TabluarInline widget. p  pSo what I essentially wanna do is automatically add rows to that display when the category field is changed by the user in admin add page.p  pWhat would be the general approach to form something like this e.g Trigger display of some default rowsvalues based on the change of value in another form field on the admin page for the modelp  pHope I explained myself well, its a bit involved although I suspect a fairly common requirement for eCommercestyle sites where certain default EAVManyToMany type rows should be automatically created based on choosing a typecategory for an itemproductp
Negative 456 pIm trying to manipulate a number of data.tables in similar ways, and would like to write a function to accomplish this.  I would like to pass in a parameter containing a list of columns that would have the operations performed.  This works fine when the vector declaration of columns is the left hand side of the  operator, but not if it is declared earlier or passed into the function.  The follow code shows the issue.p  precodedt  data.tablea  letters, b  12, c113 colsToDelete  cb, c dt[,colsToDelete  NULL]  doesnt work but I dont understand why not. dt[,cb, c  NULL]  works fine, but doesnt allow passing in of columns codepre  pThe error is Adding new column colsToDelete then assigning NULL deleting it.  So clearly, its interpreting colsToDelete as a new column name.p  pThe same issue occurs when doing something along these linesp  precodedt[, colNames  lapply.SD, adjustValue, yfactor, .SDcols  colNames] codepre  pI new to R, but rather more experienced with some other languages, so this may be a silly question.p

Negative 456 pI was just programming away a new app on Android Studio, experimenting with code Im new to Java. I was experimenting with Dialogs, and had a Dialog to set the Color of the layout. I had a list of colors and I was using codesetBackgroundColorColor.BLACKcode For example, and even when i set it to use Black or a RGB value, it always just sets the layout color to blue, even when using Color.GREEN or Color.BLACK.

The External and Internal contains a lot of controls like EditTexts, RadioButtons, etc.p  pThe information or data is not saved immediately and sometimes is not even saved not needed to. This is because there are a lot of times that the user captures some data in tab 1 and then switches to tab 3, then to tab 2, and again to tab 1, and so on. And as I said, occasionally is only for getting some quick information calculated in the tab 1 Summary which is not useful for saving.p  pThats the reason the data dont need to be destroyed when changing tabs, hence the use of Hide and Show.p  pI know I can temporarily store the information using a variety of methods, but it is really a lot of information like around 180 variables in tab 3 for giving an example. The most practical and easy way I have come is to avoid recreating the Fragments.p  pAnyway, with this information in mind, could I get some advice on how I can avoid the overlapping and at the same time retain the information stored in those Fragments when switching through themp  pI really appreciate the help, thanks in advancep

Negative 456 pI have a clientserver application using Java sockets. Until now it works in the following wayp  pThe client opens a socket connection to the server. The socketHandler thread of the server puts the new socket onto a LinkedBlockingQueue. A Worker thread takes a socket from the queue and gets and reads an object from the stream the clients send object to the server and writes an answer back to the client and closes the socket.p  pBut now I want to create a connection pool so that the connections can be kept open but I still want the LinkedBlockingQueud.p  pMy idea is that each new connection is put on a queue, lets call it openSocketQueue, and then the socketHandler thread or some other thread iterates over the openSocketQueue and checks if there is new data available without reading the data. If the data is available, it removes the socket from the queue and puts it on the LinkedBlockingQueue. After the worker has finished the socket is not closed but put back onto the openSocketQueue.p  pIs this reasonable How an I iterate over sockets checking if there is new data avialble in an efficient wayp  pBy the way, I cannot change to NIO because I dont have time for this.p

Any ideas    var valueNSNumberInParse NSNumber  valueInParse as NSNumber     Nil     printlnvalueNSNumberInParse     Exception as Im trying to unwrap nil      var unwrappedNSNumberNSNumber  valueNSNumberInParse codepre  pPart of my frustration is that I dont understand why println works fine for AnyObject but all the casting fails.  Clearly theres code that can interpret the value as a string to show for println, but that syntax eludes me for proper casting. p

It seems the most straightforward but it involves to use the disk the lot, so I suspect it is not the best.pli lipload all the file in a big buffer. More gentle with the hardrive, but needs a lot of ram if you use several long files. And if your file is very long, or has a lot of channels, I imagine the index variable could get corrupted. For example if its a 16bit integer maybe it cannot reach the end of the file or am I paranoid pli ul  pand Im thinking about hybrid things, like  p  ul lipusing very big buffers without loading the whole filepli lipstore the file in a custom format on hardrive, in a way that its optimized for accessing it quickly.pli ul  pSo, what do you think, how do you deal with this  I dont really care whats the best, Im more wondering about the pros and cons of each.p

Negative 456 pIm reading and parsing CSV files into a SQL Server 2008 database. This process uses a generic CSV parser for all files.p  pThe CSV parser is placing the parsed fields into a generic field import table F001 VARCHARMAX NULL, F002 VARCHARMAX NULL, Fnnn ... which another process then moves into real tables using SQL code that knows which parsed field Fnnn goes to which field in the destination table. So once in the table, only the fields that are being copied are referenced. Some of the files can get quite large a million rows.p  pThe question is does the number of fields in a table significantly affect performance or memory usage Even if most of the fields are not referenced. The only operations performed on the field import tables are an INSERT and then a SELECT to move the data into another table, there arent any JOINs or WHEREs on the field data.p  pCurrently, I have three field import tables, one with 20 fields, one with 50 fields and one with 100 fields this being the max number of fields Ive encountered so far. There is currently logic to use the smallest file possible.p  pId like to make this process more generic, and have a single table of 1000 fields Im aware of the 1024 columns limit. And yes, some of the planned files to be processed from 3rd parties will be in the 9001000 field range.p  pFor most files, there will be less than 50 fields.p  pAt this point, dealing with the existing three field import tables plus planned tables for more fields 200,500,1000 is becoming a logistical nightmare in the code, and dealing with a single table would resolve a lot of issues, provided I dont give up much performance.p

I dont have the code for the dll. Admittedly, I dont even know what language the dll was written in.

The documentation also states that the string will never exceed 255 bytes in length.p  pIve consistently gotten the error Attempted to read or write protected memory.

Negative 456 pIm trying to use AngularJS which Im new to in combination with TypeScript while following the a hrefhttpsdocs.angularjs.orgtutorial relnofollowtutoriala. a hrefhttpwww.scottlogic.comblog20140826StrongTypingWithAngularJS.html relnofollowThisa helped me a lot, but now I ran into the following problembr Im using the typing file from DefinitelyTyped which states that each codeIServiceProvidercode which a hrefhttpsgithub.comborisyankovDefinitelyTypedblobmasterangularjsangular.d.tsL1296 relnofollowcodeIHttpProvidercodea inherits has a a hrefhttpsgithub.comborisyankovDefinitelyTypedblobmasterangularjsangular.d.tsL37 relnofollowcodegetcodea property.

Negative 456 pI have a JavaScala application installed under Gnome 3 with a corresponding code.desktopcode FreeDesktop file. I have added a codeMimeTypecode entry so I can open sound files codeaudioxaiffcode with that application.p  pSo far so good. The problem is that every time I choose to open a sound file, for example in Nautilus, ema new copyem of the application is started. This does not work in this case, because its a true MDA with global windows, and so I want additional files to be opened emwith the already started instanceem of the application.p  pHow would I achieve that Is there a way to prevent Gnome from opening another copy of my already launched application And how would my application receive the event for opening another file The normal procedure is to pass in the file list with the codeFcode place holder into the static codemaincode method of my application.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong Looking at a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions177189howtoimplementasingleinstancejavaapplicationthis questiona, one solution I can see is the socketbased one. Here the application opens a socket on a known port. If the second instance is launched, it will encounter a codeBindExceptioncode because the socket is already taken.p  pIn my case, this was easy, because the application at hand already features a TCPbased OSC server. So I could reuse that functionality to not only detect an existing instance, but also to send a command to open a new file.p  pI am still interested in learning if there are easier or better solutions. What I dont like about the TCP approach is that one has to rely on the fact that the system allows me to use a particular port and that that port is never used by another application.p

So why is happening that p  precode    class Prime extends ThreadDemo implements Runnable           public void run              forint i2ilt20i                      ifprimei                              System.out.printf Prime No. d n,i                                      class notPrime extends ThreadDemo implements Runnable             int number 0        public void run                    primenumber               class ThreadDemo      public boolean primeint startvalue              forint i2 iltstartvalue i                     ifstartvaluei  0                            System.err.printf No. Prime  d n, startvalue                return false                              return true            public static void mainString args[]              Prime th1  new Prime         Thread childOne  new Threadth1         childOne.start         notPrime th2  new notPrime         Thread childTwo  new Threadth2         childTwo.start          codepre  pThis is the result after I pressed runp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBkIy0.png altThis is the result after I pressed runp  pThis is the result after pressing again runp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKjbbe.png altThis is the result after pressing again runp
Negative 456 pI have an Ubuntu 10.10 machine which is supposed to be a server. It only uses about 150W to run, but electricity is not free  Nobody actually uses it during the night, and I would like to make it autohibernate and autowake. I know about the rtcwake command, but i am not sure how to make it autohibernate.  Can anyone point me some ideas about how to this Like setting it to hibernate every day at 1000 PM and wake up at 645 AM. p
Negative 456 pI am learning some basic python 3 and have been stuck at this problem for 2 days now and i cant seem to get anywhere...br Been reading the think python book and Im working on chapter 13 and the case study it contains. The chapter is all about reading a file and doing some magic with it like counting total number of words and the most used words.br One part of the program is about Dictionary subtraction where the program fetches all the word from one textfile emthat are not found in another textfileem. p  pWhat I also need the program to do is count the most common word from the first file, excluding the  words found in the dictionary text file. This functionality has had me stuck for two days and i dont really know how to solve this...p  pThe Code to my program is as followp  precodeimport string  def processfilefilename   hist     fp  openfilename   for line in fp     processlineline, hist return hist   def processlineline, hist     line  line.replace,        for word in line.split         word  word.stripstring.punctuation  string.whitespace         word  word.lower          hist[word]  hist.getword, 0  1   def mostcommonhist     t  []     for key, value in hist.items         t.appendvalue, key      t.sort     t.reverse     return t   def subtractd1, d2     res       for key in d1         if key not in d2             res[key]  None     return res   hist  processfilealicech1.txt words  processfilecommonwords.txt diff  subtracthist, words   def totalwordshist     return sumhist.values   def differentwordshist     return lenhist   if name  main  print Total number of words, totalwordshist print Number of different words, differentwordshist  t  mostcommonhist print The most common words are for freq, word in t[07]     print word, t, freq printThe words in the book that arent in the word list are for word in diff.keys     printword codepre  pI then created a test dict containing a few words and imaginary times they occur and a test list to try and solve my problem and the code for that isp  precodehistfake  hello 12, removeme 2, hi 3, fish250, chicken55, cow10, bye20, the93, she79, to75 listfake [removeme, fish]  newdict   for key, val in histfake.items     for commonword in listfake         if key  commonword             newdict[key]  val         else             newdict[key]  0  sortcommongone  [] for key, value in newdict.items     sortcommongone.appendvalue, key sortcommongone.sort sortcommongone.reverse  for freq, word in sortcommongone     printword, t, freq codepre  pThe problem is that that code only works for one word. Only one matched word between the dict and the list gets the value of 0 thought that I could give the duplicate words the vale 0 since I only need the 7 most common words that are not found in the commonword text file.br How can I solve this Created a account here just to try and get some help with this since Stackowerflow has helped me before with other problems. But this time I needed to ask the question myself. Thanksp

Negative 456 pI have a situation where I need to compare two sets of data from Sql Server.

Negative 456 pI am using Python 3.4 and I am writing a short script. I have an executable that take the output of a software and outputs a bunch of csv files with the requested data.

Essentially iterate this process.p  pEach csv file will have a unique name. My goal is to help automate creating graphs. Sometimes this can end up being 100s of graphs. I have searched a lot on how to do this with little help.  p  pAgain I would initiate the script and it would run through each csv file whether there is 5 or 500 and then copy the data a certain range which is always in the same cells then paste it into the template xlsx file I have created and save it with a similar name to the csv except it will have .xlsx as the extension. p  pI do not know if this is the best approach or if I should create a csv template instead that it will copy to.p  pAny help is much appreciated, thank you.p
Negative 456 pstrongShort versionstrong. Is there a Linux API that allows to read from a file descriptor similar to read without actually removing the data from the OS buffer Some way to split the read into the equivalent of a front read without removing and pop remove.p  pstrongScenariostrong. I have a TUN device which I use to deliver IP datagrams via my own network stack. The problem is, especially when the application above uses UDP, the TUN device may be flooded with data by the OS, which my stack cant manage fast enough.p  pstrongGoalstrong. Id like to read a datagram as soon as it arrives over the TUN device, emwithout removing it from the kernel bufferem, inspect the datagram, decide if the rest of the proprietary protocol stack below can handle it, and if so, pop the data from the kernel buffer, otherwise keep the data there. p  pstrongWhystrong. The reason it makes a difference not to pop from the kernel buffer is that the application above can actually realize that the lower layers of the network protocols are congested since its own write or send over the network interface would fail, and act accordingly. If the data is removed, as with a regular read, the application doesnt have any clue about congestion, and keeps flooding. p

Negative 456 pI am setting up refresh tokens in a web service that is based on the Web API 2 template. It is going to be consumed by both our own website as well as external clients. p  pAfter researching for some time, the general recommendation on securing the refresh token from XSS attacks is to store the identifier within an encrypted cookie. I know that I could return both the authentication and refresh tokens in cookies by using the UseCookieAuthentication method instead of the UseOAuthBearerAuthentication, but that would then cause complications when Im dealing with external clients.p  pThe code I currently have for setting up the configuration isp  precodepublic void ConfigureAuthIAppBuilder app      var applicationProvider  new ApplicationOAuthProvider      var applicationRefreshProvider  new ApplicationRefreshTokenProvider      var oAuthServerOptions  new OAuthAuthorizationServerOptions              AllowInsecureHttp  true,          TokenEndpointPath  new PathStringtoken,         AccessTokenExpireTimeSpan  TimeSpan.FromDays1,          Provider  applicationProvider,         RefreshTokenProvider  applicationRefreshProvider            Token Generation     app.UseOAuthAuthorizationServeroAuthServerOptions     app.UseOAuthBearerAuthenticationnew OAuthBearerAuthenticationOptions  codepre  pA workaround I could implement would be adding a method to a controller on the resource server that then does that transformation step for the javascript based clients, but that doesnt quite make sense to me to do.p  pIs there a way I can accomplish this in the auth configuration, and is that the correct approach to take I dont want to take the wrong direction if I can help it.p
Negative 456 pImplementing a custom filesystem that works in userspace crossplatform seems like a daunting task  FUSE is great on linux, but awkward to install on OSX, and Windows doesnt support userspace filesystems at all.

Negative 456 piv been trying to figure out how to convert this css in to jquery for a few days now without sucess.p  pbasically what im trying to do is to get some scrolling going on several articles.p  pcurrently im giving each article a separate panel id, like panel1, panel2 etc and they slide with different values, from 100vh to 500vh etc. Problem is, that isnt very optimised and i can forsee in the future having 100s of sections.p  pThe css for the first panels are as followsp  precodea[ id anchor2 ]target  main article.panels      webkittransform translateY 100vh   a[ id anchor3 ]target  main article.panels      webkittransform translateY 200vh   a[ id anchor4 ]target  main article.panels      webkittransform translateY 300vh   a[ id anchor5 ]target  main article.panels      webkittransform translateY 400vh  codepre  pBut id like to put it in jquery so i can automate the scrolling and just put the panel id in a variable and automate it rather than fill up the css with a ton of unique inputs.p  pif i could put something like this in a jquery, i think i would be on good way,p  precodea[ id anchor5 ]target  main article.panels webkittransform translateY   currentHeight  vh codepre  pim still a big green around the edges on html5 and css and jquery, but iv been slowly learing by reading the posts and questions on here, but this is something i havent been able to clue out yet so if anyone can point me in the right direction, id be grateful.p

Negative 456 pIs there a way to get a conditional increment based on cycles in data, and carry it forward in a query field  This is for Oracle, 11G2.p  pI have monthly activity data 40 years for individuals, tracking changes to a membership.  Individuals can join the service, remain for an indefinite period of time, quit, and rejoin later.  The changes have a specific code for when they leave the service.  I am trying to find a way to follow these quit rejoin cycles for each individual, and increment a column value, showing how many times theyve been in the service, and associating the history records during the period.p  pUsing analytic functions, I can detect their first appearance, and when they leave, and when theyre BACK in after leaving.  I havent figured out a way to use this toincrement a column and carry that value forward until the end for that individual.p  pIts not a sequence, because each individual starts at 1.

Negative 456 pI intend to make an app that will predict the text a user will type in a strongMultiAutoCompleteTextViewstrong. Using Kyoto Language Modelling toolkit I have generated a file with onegrams, 2grams and 3gramsover 22000 grams, each line having the form [probability] [ngram]. I have processed that file and sorted it descending, so I would have first the ngram with the highest probability to occur. I did this separately from the application program. I saved those grams in a separate txt file and now I am saving them in an array of Strings so I can add them in my program for the strongMultiAutoCompleteTextViewstrong.  1. The problem that I encounter is that instead of diacriticsspecial characters in my language such as ,,.. it will display some other sort of characters in the TextView. Why 2. Also, I would like to know if there is a way to set a maximum number of suggestions in the dropdown list, lets say the first 34 words sorted by probability. 3. I would also like the strongMultiAutoCompleteTextViewstrong to display the suggestions that start with that specific character not all the ngrams that contain it. I dont know if Im explicit here, maybe Ill post a printscreen to show you what Im talking about.p  pHere is my xmlp  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidpaddingBottomdimenactivityverticalmargin androidpaddingLeftdimenactivityhorizontalmargin androidpaddingRightdimenactivityhorizontalmargin androidpaddingTopdimenactivityverticalmargin toolscontextcom.example.textpredict.MainActivity gt  ltMultiAutoCompleteTextView     androidididmultiAutoCompleteTextView1     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidlayoutalignParentToptrue     androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue     androidlayoutmarginTop145dp     androidcompletionThreshold1     androidems10     androidfontFamilyArial      gt codepre  pp  pand here is the classp  precodeprotected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain     try          word  readfile      catch IOException e           TODO Autogenerated catch block         e.printStackTrace          ArrayAdapterltStringgt adapter  new ArrayAdapterltStringgtthis,             android.R.layout.simpledropdownitem1line, word     MultiAutoCompleteTextView textView  MultiAutoCompleteTextView findViewByIdR.id.multiAutoCompleteTextView1     textView.setAdapteradapter     textView.setDropDownHeight500     textView.setTokenizernew MultiAutoCompleteTextView.CommaTokenizer  codepre  pAnd I am willing to accept any suggestions of different approaches to this problem.

Negative 456 pI am having a couple of issues with alert controllers in swift. I have two functions for displaying activity indicators. 1 with animation, and one without. The reason for creating the second one without an animation was because.. I am displaying an activity on a view controller when a user clicks on a table view cell and is segued to a new controller. This controller calls a webservice and populates a second table view.p  pMy problem was that the web service was returning a response so quick that the activity indicator wasnt up on screen when I was trying to dismiss it i.e. in the repsonse of the webservice call. I was presenting this indicator in the viewdidload and then calling the web service function in the view did load after.p  pThe only way i could get around this was to create an activity alert which did not have an animation as it seemed as though the animation was slowing it down a bit. But when I set the animation property to false, the alert controller did not have a backgroundColor. When I try to add a background color to the alert controller, the width changes to full screen.p  pSo Im looking forp  pstrongAstrong a way around dismissing the regular alert controller when the web service returns too quickly p  porp  pstrongBstrong to reduce the size of the second alert controller which has no animation.p  pThanks in advance.

Negative 456 pIn attempting to calculate the longest goalscoring streak for a single player, Ive hit a stumbling block with the codegtcode PHP operator not performing as intended.p  pThe data is presented in a table as followsp  pre      date         gls       19800816       2      19800819       1     19800823       1   19800826       0   19800830       1   19800906       2   19800913       0 ... and so on     pre  pThe PHP query I am using is as followsp  precodeSELECT gls, MINdate as StartDate, MAXdate as EndDate, COUNT as Games  FROM SELECT gls, date,              SELECT COUNT                  FROM goalsengine G                  WHERE G.gls ltgt GE.gls                 AND G.date lt GE.date as RunGroup     FROM goalsengine GE A  WHERE glsgt1  GROUP BY gls, RunGroup  ORDER BY Games codepre  pI formed the query this way in the belief that codegtcode would tally up streaks where this player had scored one or more goals in a game. From the table above, the first three entries would represent a scoring run of three games, for example.p  pInstead, the query is returning streaks but only where a certain number of goals are scored i.e. despite scoring in the first three games, the first entry where two goals were scored, not one is ignored when the streak is returned.p  pTo return the results, I am using the followingp  precodewhilerowmysqlfetchassocresult     startrundate  dated F Y,strtotimerow[StartDate]  endrundate  dated F Y,strtotimerow[EndDate]           echo lttrgt    echo lttdgt.row[Games].lttdgt echo lttd classtableprofile styletextalignrightgt.startrundate.  .endrundate.lttdgt   echo lttrgt     rowCount  1  codepre  pBy comparison, codeWHERE gls0code is giving me the desired nongoalscoring streaks. I feel I have perhaps overlooked something straightforward but cannot see what.p

Negative 456 pIm new to PostgreSQL. I am facing an intermittent issue in postgreSQL service startup. Im using postgreSQL 9.2 on windows. Problem is as belowp  pAfter restarting the computer, sometimes PostgreSQL service is not started automatically. But I see postgres.exe processes running in task manager and postmaster.pid file is created in data directory. But the pgctl.exe process is not running. Hence the PostgreSQL service also shows as not started. I have another service which depends on postgreSQL. Even that is not started as postgreSQL service is not started. If I try to restart the service again, it fails saying the server is already running in that data directoryp  pAfter doing some checks in event viewer, I found 2 error messages. Each message in different instances.br 1 Timed out waiting for server startupbr 2 Lock file postmaster.pid already exists.  Is another postmaster PID 3856 running in data directoryp  pLooking at these two error messages, I could think of two possible reasonsbr 1 PostgreSQL service took more time to load all libraries during service startup, causing timeout and terminating pgctl.exe process. But postgres.exe processes were already started and not killed, also a postmaster.pid file was created in data directorybr 2 postgreSQL was not completely unloaded and postmaster.pid was not deleted during machine shutdown  p  pI tried increasing default service startup timeout value to 30 secs, but it didnt help.p  pworkaround is manually killing the existing postgres.exe processes and restarting the service again. But Im looking for the permanent solution.p  pPlease help me to identify the correct root cause and will be grateful for any suggestion solution.p  pThanks in advance, Jayanthp
