Positive 691 pI know you can get the codefontfamilycode value by codewindow.getComputedStylecode but thats not always exactly the font that is used by a browser to render. For example, if the given text contains the multilingual text the font family does not carry, the browser renders the text partially with the system font.p  pIf you take a look at the builtin web developer tool, either in Chrome or Firefox, they both have a little area to display codeRendered Fontscode pane on Chrome or codeFontscode tab on Firefox the exact fonts that are used. For the Firefox, I guess a hrefhttpsdxr.mozilla.orgmozillacentralsourcedevtoolsclientfontinspectorfontinspector.js relnofollowthis codea is used and it seems to be calling the internal API.p  pIm looking for any DOMcompliant or vendorspecific way to get the exact font from the JavaScript land or else. If that means writing a browser extensionaddon to provide APIinject infowhatever for the inpage code to access, thats the worst case, but acceptable.p

Positive 691 pI have checked each and every question and article about this, that I could find, but nothing really answers it. I make it sound as if I have just one question, theres more of them.p  pMaybe I should first explain what I am trying to do, I am building a File Manager entirely in JavaScript, the File Manager receives files from Backend PHP, Twig, it then stores them in an array of Folder, each Folder has its own Files, Folders is an Array, and Files in each Folder is an Array as well, these Files are also shown on the page, and the user can select, copy, cut, paste  other operations  them  I am still writing these operations, because here lies the problem .br Files on page have dataid assigned to them, so that I can easily operate on them between File Manager and the Backend, and because I know the ID of every and each file, I think I could completely eliminate traversing through Arrays of Files in search of a particular File, if I could only create an Array that would take the ID of a File as an Index, and because this is JavaScript, I can do that but there are some problems with it.p  pTrying to use an Object for this task just does not work, because it is just way slower than Array  now, I understand, that the differences in speed, even if in millions, are not that big, but why not try to dig for ultimate performance, right  p  pSo here is a list of questions, that I cannot seem to find a reliable answer top  ol liWhy is Object on Chrome so much faster, than Object on Firefox li liWhy is accessing an undefined index on Chrome so much slower li liWhy is Array so much faster on Firefox, than on Chrome li liI know why Chrome loses performance with higher indexes  at 100k it transforms the array into a list, I think, it was answered with a link to source in another question on SO , but Firefox loses performance gradually as if it traveresed to higher indexes sequentially, even if accessed directly, why is that li liWhy is an Array extermely slow when there is only one element in it, but that element is at a very high index li ol  pThere are probably some more questions I have, but I cannot think of them right now.p  hr  pThe fastest configuration I found, that supports IDs as indexes and holes between them, as well as starting at a high index, is using an Array that holds the data you want to store, and another array, that just holds the indexes, so that when you are searching for an object with ID 10, you touch the index Array, instead of the Array with data. br You can see an example of this in a hrefhttpjsperf.comarraymanagementperformance2 relnofollowhttpjsperf.comarraymanagementperformance2a.p  pEDIT If you want to see the performance degradation, please review this jsperf and change minId and maxId to some big numebers.p  hr  pHere are some statsp  pObjectp  pRead Defined Firefox 165.173 mln opssec  Chrome 351.699 mln opssecbr Read Undefined Firefox 98.582 mln opssec  Chrome 54.666 mln opssecbr Write Close Firefox 7.599 mln opssec  Chrome 291.244 mln opssecbr Write Far Firefox 5.599 mln opssec  Chrome 93.733 mln opssecbr Write Overwrite Firefox 7.599 mln opssec  Chrome 291.244 mln opssecbrp  pArrayp  pRead Defined Firefox 681.206 mln opssec  Chrome 401.522 mln opssecbr Read Undefined Firefox 681.206 mln opssec  Chrome 62.827 mln opssecbr Write Close Firefox 400.234 mln opssec  Chrome 121.519 mln opssecbr Write Far Firefox 348.560 mln opssec  Chrome 121.519 mln opssecbr Write Overwrite Firefox 400.234 mln opssec  Chrome 234.337 mln opssecbrp  pP.S.

Positive 691 pWe have a page that makes AJAX calls to get a JSON file.

Negative 691 pI have a fairly infrequent problem occuring with source control. In the example here the problem was occuring with Perforce, but I suspect the same problem will occur with many SCMs, especially distributed SCMs.p  pPerforce supports changelists or changesets if you prefer. Changelists support two common usagesp  ol lipWhen you commit a changelist, the commit is atomic so that all the files are committed or none are. This is the headline feature that most people talk about when referring to changelists.pli lipPerforce supports multiple changelists. Basically, when you check out a file you tell it which changelist it belongs to. So, if you are working on the fancy new email feature which is going to take months of work and makes millions of dollars and somebody from tech support comes to you with a bug that must be fixed yesterday, you dont have to start with a new branch of the whole project. You can just check out the buggy file into a new changelist, fix the problem, check in the new changelist and get back to the real work of the new email feature, as though nothing had happened.pli ol  pFor the most part everything works great. However, when you are implemening the email feature you are making zillions of changes all over the place, especially in main.h, and it just so happens that when go to work on the bug fix you discover that the tiny change you have to make is also in main.h. The changelist for the new feature already has main.h checked out, so you cant easily put it in the changelist for the bug fix.p  pNow what do you do You have several choicesp  ol lipCreate a new clientspec. A clientspec in Perforce is a list of filesdirectories in the depot and a local destination where everything is to be copied. So you can create a second copy of the project without any of changes for the email feature.pli lipDo a fudge. Backup your modified copy of main.h and revert this file. You are then free to checkout main.h into the bugfix changelist. You fix the bug, check in the bugfix changelist, then checkout main.h into the email feature changelist. Finally you merge all your changes from the backup you made at the start.pli lipYou determine that all the changes you have made to main.h have no side affects or dependencies, so you just move main.h into the bugfix changelist, make the change and check it in. You then check it out again into the email feature changelist. Obviously there are two problems with this approach firstly there may in fact be side affects that you hadnt considered and secondly you have corrupted your version histoty.pli ol  pOption 1 is probably the cleanest, but not always practical. A project I was working on had millions of lines of code and a really complicated build process. It would take a day to setup a new environment, so it was not really practical for a 5 minute bug fix.p  pOption 3 is a bad option, but is is the quickest, so it can be very seductive.p  pThat leaves Option 2, which is the one I would generally use. p  pDoes anybody have a better solutionp  pMy apologies for the lengthy question, but I have discovered on StackOverflow that fully thought out questions elicit better answers.p

Negative 691 pAfter a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions543995replicatingvisualstudiocomregistrationwithawixinstallerasking about what Visual Studio does to register a  COM Librarya, it became clear that VS did two things for COM registrationp  ol liRegistered the COM Libraryli liCreates and registers a Type Libraryli ol  pVisual Studio seems to do this registration using regasm.exe.  For the first part the direct COM registration using codetallowcode or codeheatcode WiX 2.0 or WiX 3.0 seems to get all of the basic COM registration information correct.p  pHowever, what tallowheat doesnt seem to do is set up a type library installation.  It would be possible to create a custom action to do this with a WiX installer and regasm.exe, but invoking custom actions are not best practices when it comes to Microsoft installer based installers.p  pUpon further research, it looks like an msi has the ability to generate the type library upon installation.  In fact, WiX seems to have direct support for it  In a file element, you can add a a hrefhttpwix.sourceforge.netmanualwix3wixxsdtypelib.htmTypeliba element.  In fact, a hrefhttpchenhaoyork.spaces.live.comblogcnsC0B4F9D80B744CD135.entryan article over here on wixa has an example of filling out the TypeLib element with a hrefhttpwix.sourceforge.netmanualwix3wixxsdinterface.htmInterfacea elements.p  pIt seems theres at least two required attributes to an Interface elementp  ol liIdli liNameli ol  pa hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comlarryostermanarchive20060109510856.aspxLarry Osterman speaks about the other parts of the interface that need to be registered for a TypeLib in generala, and this Interface entry seems to take care of the individual parts.  Larry says we need to specify the ProxyStubClassId32 as 0002042400000000C000000000000046, so we can easily add that. p  pWhere to go from there and what to fill out for the various Interface elements has me stumped.  Ive gone ahead and added the TypeLib element to my wix file, and it successfully compiles.  Im a bit clueless as to how to set up the Interface elements though.  What do we need to do to properly fill out the TypeLib element, and what apps or tools can I use to get itp  pThe answer below by wcoenen looks promising...Im going to give it a shot.p  pUpdate Posted my final solution below as an answer.p

Negative 691 pI have implemented a very basic plugin system as part of a emstatic libraryem. Each plugin implements the support for a specific image format, e.g. GIF, JPEG, etc.. Furthermore, I have a Singleton a class called codePluginManagercode that keeps a list of all available plugins.p  pThe tricky part is that I want to disableenable the plugins by adding or removing their source files from the project file. To achieve this, each plugin creates a global variable with different names and registers the plugin in the constructor of that class to codePluginManagercode.p  pSomething like this for the JPEG format...p  precodestruct JPEGPlugin     constructor will register plugin   JPEGPlugin        PluginManagerSingleton.RegisterPluginthis        plenty of other code   ...   JPEGPlugin jpeginstance   instantiate in global scope codepre  pHowever, while this works perfectly in theory, it fails when linking this static library to other code to build an executable. As long as this executable does not access the plugin globals like codejpeginstancecode, the linker does not see a connection he completely ignores the sideeffects of the constructor and does not include the code in the final executable. In other words, the JPEG plugin is not available in the final app.p  pI ran into the problems a couple of times over the years, and I always searched the net for solutions. Each time, I just found pages that basically say that its a known problem and that I have to live with it.p  pBut maybe someone on SO knows how to make this workingp

Negative 691 pThe organization I currently work for uses SVN for developing PHP applications.  Our development cycle started out simple, doing a commit updates the web root using the postcommit hook in order to see changes right away.  Than we ran into an issue with development features getting in the way of bug fixes and holding up the fixed files from being moved to production and sometimes causing issues on the prod server.p  pSo I introduced a release branching schema that means all full releases are copied to their own branch, so all changes made to production needed to occur in this branch and long term development occurred on the trunk.  The idea when this first started was to only do fixes and make the developer responsible for moving their own updates back to the trunk, but after five instances of developers blindly merging changes causing data loss, and constant development of immediate release items on the release branch this methodology was abandoned.  p  pKnow I am faced with a branch that is way out of sync since some people did not get the trunkbranch concept and were developing on the trunk with changes merged into the trunk from a private branch creating the potential of more lost code when merging all the changes from the past month back from the current release branch.p  pI have the chance to start over and enforce a proper developmentrelease cycle of web development.  SVN seems to be move geared toward release development binary applications, where in this case we can go a full year without moving the full package to production.p  pWith that background, here is my question What Web Development SVN cycle andor schema would you recommend for this situation Does this require a complete methodology overhaul or am I just missing something simple  p  pThanks for any ideasp

Negative 691 pWeve spent the last few months tuning our production application so that we experience no full GCs. We now experience young GCs only, with the rate of young GCs dependent on the rate of object allocation.p  pOur application needs to be as close to realtime as possible so now were trying to reduce the number of young GCs. As the old axiom goes, most of the data we allocate ends up being garbage and discarded at the next young GC. So no need to preallocate for this type of data. However there is a good amount of objects defined by type that we know will make it from young GC to old GC. p  pWould it make sense to preallocate these objects during more ideal times i.e. at startup so well end up allocating less during our lessthanideal times Ive read the literature that mentions how object pooling is not recommended with the latest JVMs because allocation is much cheaper.

And in those cases, I effectively get a call codeHtml.RenderPartial MyView, null code. And what does the HtmlHelper do when the model is null Believe it or not, it just goes ahead and takes the parent views model. Regardless of its type.p  pSo, naturally, in those cases, I get an exception saying The model item passed into the dictionary is of type Parent.View.Model.Type, but this dictionary requires a model item of type System.Guidp  pSo the question is stronghow do I make MVC correctly pass codenew NullableltGuidgt  HasValue  false code instead of trying to grab the parents modelstrongp  pstrongNotestrong I did consider wrapping my codeGuidcode in an object of another type, specifically created for this occasion, but this seems completely ridiculous. Dont want to do that as long as theres another way.p  pstrongNote 2strong now that Ive wrote all this, Ive realized that the question may be reduced to emhow to pass a null for model without ending up with parents modelemp

Negative 691 pI have two views one is a normal view built from one table with an integer ID and other columns for the record lets call it View1.  I have another View View2, which has an integer ID column and a second column named table type varchar.

Negative 691 pSo we have a drupal 6 website that is running good, but now we want to prepare it for a emlotem of traffic, so the next step is to have 2 web servers running the same site the database is already running on a separate server and then use a another server to do the load balancing between those 2.p  pSo yesterday i mirrored the files of the original drupal server that runs at lets say www.example.com to the new server that runs at lets say 123.123.123.123  just an IP, no domain, than i edited the settings.php file of the second one to make sure that the base url is 123.123.123.123.p  ponce i browsed to 123.123.123.123 to test out if the mirror of the site was working, i got a blank page.. looking at the source, the basic structure was there, but no content, and the CSS was pointing to the right place but still not showing.. I decided to browse to 123.123.123.123admin and see what i could do.. went to the site performance and cleared the cache, didnt do a thing but then i noticed the original drupal was now showing blank... so i went to www.example.comadmin, cleared the cache also, site was back, but it appeared the menu router was destroyed because i was getting page not found everywhere. So i went to the modules page and clicked save hopping that it would rebuild the menu router. It did the trick, site was back online and working good.p  pObviously i stopped poking around with 123.123.123.123 and decided it was time to ask for some help from the experts...p  pWhat am i doing wrong Any help would be greatly appreciatedp  pJulienp

Negative 691 pI am new to JQuery and jqGrid.  I have been successful in getting them to work well with a new ASP.Net MVC3 application I am creating.  However, I wanted to retrofit jqGrid to a TomcatJava application that I took over management of strongNOTE but that I did not codestrong written back in 2005.  This app uses a combination of JSPServletsServicesVelocity on top of Tomcat 6.20.  The page in question is a Velocity template that is backed by a POST to a servlet that is the talks to the service.  I have jqGrid configured fine inside the template and it sets up properly on rendering.  p  pNow, all I am trying to do for starters is not modify anything in the service that returns the grid search results.  Ie, not wanting to have jqGrid postback for data on render just yet.  The service returns a search results collection object that contains the search results data for the grid and paginated based on some POST criteria that Velocity can manipulate in the template.  So, when the page is rendered by the Velocity engine, the data I seek is present, but locked up in the SearchResults collection.  What I am unsure about is what approach I should take to pull that SearchResults collection into the jqGrid as it is rendered along with the page  The original HTML grid was built with a Velocity codeforcode loop looping through the collection and building a TABLE structure with each rows attributes.p  pEventually, if the client likes this much and approves the expense to integrate jqGrid more fully, I will modify the service to return JSON directly to the jqGrid and let the jqGrid handle the data as one would typically do with jqGrids URL property, etc.  But I need to sell it first and was hoping I could work the existing results collection in as a first step.  Just new enough to JQuery and jqGrid to not be sure how to attack this in the least painful way as possible.p  pOne thing I am adding is that I am not a Velocity expert.  Only learned enough of it to maintain this package.  My understanding is that Velocity renders the page first before it is then sent to the browser.  So, it would seem that it could also render the codeltscriptgtcode section for jqGrid andor a data structure in the codeltscriptgtcode section that could feed jqGrids rows.  Just not sure what that needs to look like in a locally supplied context.  I have only worked with jqGrids URL GET and POST.p

Negative 691 pWe are a company that develops and sells shareware ActiveX and .NET controls for other developers see a hrefhttpwww.10Tec.com relnofollowwww.10Tec.coma, and several customers reported a very strange problem with our ActiveX grid control, iGrid, in recent versions of MS Access  200320072010.p  pThe most strange point is that the problem occurs on a random unpredictable stage when working with an MS Access form that contains our iGrid control. After you open the form next time in design view or form view, you see a blank control container for the iGrid ActiveX and you get the There is no object in this control error message. As a result of this problem, you may also getp  pRuntime error 97 Can not call friend function on object which is not an instance of defining class.p  pIt looks like the form becomes corrupted after some actions of the developer.p  pThis problem has never occurred in other development environments including Visual Basic 6 or even UserForms in Ms WordExcel VBA, but from time to time this happens in MS Access. Sometimes even MS Access freezes when you open the problem form, and you need to terminate the process thru CTRLALTDEL.p  pWe tried to find a sequence of actions which can lead to the problem for sure, but we have not managed to do that. The only thing which may accompany the appearance of this problem is the following. If you refers a nonexisting form control in your code, and you encounter this error while debugging your form most likely, the compiler option Compile On Demand should be set for that, the form became corrupted when you hit the Reset button on the toolbar in the VBA environment.p  pIf you even do not know how to overcome this problem, but at least know how to repair the problem form  write your recipe, please. Maybe, there is also a tool to repair this automatically.p  pWe cannot reproduce the problem in a brand new form from scratch, but we have a problem mdb file. You can download it from the following source though you might need to install iGrid ActiveX alsop  pa hrefhttp10Tec.comFSTempiGridMDBNoObjProb.zip relnofollowhttp10Tec.comFSTempiGridMDBNoObjProb.zipap  pSure, this is not a problem of an unregistered ActiveX control. The problem occurs when the control is properly registered in the Windows registry.p

Negative 691 pWhy would someone prefer blocking writes over nonblocking writes My understanding is that you would only want blocking write if you want to make sure the other side got the TCP packet once the write method returned, but I am not even sure thats possible. You would have to flush and flush would have to flush the emunderlying operating system write socket bufferem. So is there any disadvantage of nonblocking socket writes Does having a large underlying write socket buffer a bad idea in terms of performance My understanding is that the smaller the underlying socket write buffer the more likely you will hit slowbuggy client and have to dropqueue packets in the application level while the underlying socket buffer is full and isWritable is returning false.p

Negative 691 pI am currently looking into browser capabilities and am trying to test the browser definition files that come with .NET 4.0. To do this I am using an addon for Firefox to change the user agent and I have a simple page which reports on the followingp  precodeRequest.UserAgent Request.Browser.Id Request.Browser.Browser Request.Browser.MajorVersion Request.Browser.MinorVersion Request.Browser.Platform Request.Browser.IsMobileDevice Request.Browser.MobileDeviceManufacturer Request.Browser.MobileDeviceModel codepre  pGenerally this gives the correct information based on the examples provided in the comments in the default browser definition files. However I am seeing strange results from time to time that I cannot quite explain.p  pTake the example iPhone user agent in the codeiphone.browsercode definition file which is as followsp  precodeMozilla5.0 iPhone U CPU like Mac OS X en AppleWebKit420 KHTML, like Gecko Version3.0 Mobile1A543a Safari419.3 codepre  pThis should return the browser as Safari, which it does. This is down to the IPhone gateway having Safari as a parent, which matches on the term codeSafaricode.p  pAltering the user agent slightly so it emulates the user agent of the mail client on an iPhone means removing the end part of the user agent as followsp  precodeMozilla5.0 iPhone U CPU like Mac OS X en AppleWebKit420 KHTML, like Gecko codepre  pThis now should return Mozilla as the browser, as it will be unable to match on the term codeSafaricode. However, analysing this immediately after the first reports back incorrect information, and still indicates the browser to be Safari.p  pAdding a custom code.browsercode file with the codeAppBrowserscode folder and then modifying that seems to force it to be correct temporarily, almost like the definitions or rules are being cached and not fully run on each request.p  pThis works the other way too, if you start with the second example user agent then upon analysing the first it will report as being Mozilla instead of Safari.p  pCan anyone explain this behaviour or a way to work around it Is it trying to do some sort of not so clever caching where it makes assumptions based on similar user agentsp  pThanks.p

Negative 691 pI have a little program here python 2.7 that runs on an old machine and it basically keeps getting pictures for timelapses by running an external binary and converts them to an efficient format to save up disk space.p  pI want to minimize the disk operations, because its already pretty old and I want it to last some more time.p  pAt the moment the program writes the data from the camera on the disk, then converts it and removes the original data. However it does that for every image, 1 it writes a large file on disk, 2 reads it to convert, 3 and then deletes it... a bunch of disc operations that arent necessary and could be done in ram, because the original file doesnt have to be stored and is only used as a basis to create another one.p  pI was sure a ramdisk was the solution, then I googled on how to do that, and google returned me a bunch of links that discourage the use of ramdisk, the reasons are many because they are not useful in modern systems im running a pretty new linux kernel they should only be used if you want to decrypt data that shouldnt hit the disk some tests shows that ramdisk could be actually slower than hd the operating system has a cache...p  pSo Im confused...p  pIn this situation, should I use a ramdiskp  pThank you.p  pPS If you want more info I have a proprietary highres camera, and a proprietary binary that I run to capture a single image, I can specify where it will write the file, which is a huge TIFF file, and then the python program runs the convert program from imagemagick to convert it to JPEG and then compress it in tar.bz2, so the quality is almost the same but the filesize is 150 of the TIFF.p

Negative 691 pI have an Android app, which is intended for use by about 10 people, i.e. it will not be published and is in house. The app connects the user to an SSH server, using jsch. I hit a problem when deciding how the user logs on. Even though the app severely limits the users functionality when logged onto the server basically only allowing the upload of certain files, they still have to log on, with the user password everyone uses the same user account. I dont think it is a good idea to give away the password like this, so I am thinking of ways to allow the user to use the app without knowing the login password. My ideas so far.p  p1 generate a ssh key and put it on each android device. Im not sure how to do this yet, or if it is possible. p  p2 encrypt the password and store it on the phone and then create an app password for the user to login to the app.p  pI would like advice about what is the best course of action.p

Negative 691 pIm developing a game for Android, and making an OpenGL text drawing subsystem for it for performance reasons. Instead of using a ttf file, I put Arial letters to a big OpenGL texture and when drawing text, each letter is mapped from that big texture this is what makes instant text drawing very fast.p  pGUI texts use fonts normally, but I use freeware commercially usable ttf files for that. So the question is only about the above selfgenerated font texture.p  pIs it allowed to use Arial in this way i.e. that its letters are generated into a texture file Its going to be a commercial game. p  pIt probably doesnt matter anyway that theyre added to a texture probably the question would remain the same if I just used an Arial ttf. The question is, can Arial be used on Android for free, in commercial gamesp

Negative 691 pCan you please help me with deciding which one of the following scenarios will work the best.p  pI have 3 user controls. Each control needs to generate content based on the results of SQL Server query, for example user control 1 populates a gridview with the output of a query.p  pI want to make use of Caching in order to reduce roundtrips to my SQL Server Database. I came up with the following two solutions, and would like to know which one will work the best.p  pScenario 1p  pPut all 3 user controls queries in a single SQL Server Stored procedure Batching, execute the stored procedure outside of the User Controls inside the containing page, and then provide each user control with its query output. Roundtrips to the database will be reduced by placing all 3 queries in a single stored procedure.br Caching in this scenario will happen by caching the output of the stored procedure. Therefore, the output of the stored procedure will be taken from memory each time to provide each user control with its output, after which each user control will generate its output. About 188 different versions of the query will be cached by ASP.NET object caching.p  pScenario 2p  pQuery the SQL Server database individually inside of each User Control, and then generate each user controls output with the query results that each one obtained. This means that each user control will individually call the SQL Server Database. Caching in this scenario will happen by caching the output of each user control, thus the user controls wont have to generate its output every time, and can get its output directly from memory. The catch in this scenario is that I will have to cache about 188 different versions of one or more of the user controls.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 691 pIm trying to develop a simple tracking system. What Im trying to do is either insert the new record or update the record IF it matches the same campaign. I want to insert a new record if the user is triggered on a new campaign. Here is my current query that work fine.p  precodeINSERT INTO tracking email,ip,referrer,campaign,timestamp  VALUES campaign[0],ip,referrer,campaign[1],timestamp  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE lasttimestamp  timestamp codepre  pMy goal is if joebob.net triggers campaign1, then it will INSERT the record. If he tries campaign 1 again, it just updates the timestamp. Now when joebob.net triggers campaign2, it inserts an entirely new record.p  pSo basically Im trying to get it to INSERT only when the user triggers a new campaign. Otherwise, I want it to update the timestamp.p  pAny ideas or advice Id really appreciate itp

Negative 691 pSo I have read all about how to use Rails 3 subdomain constraints and url helpers, which works great for most applications.  For instance, if I want an admin subdomain which I do I can usep  precodeconstraint subdomain gt admin   scope module gt admin     defaults subdomain gt admin codepre  pBut my application runs on many customers domains, and usually on a subdomain of it.  So, something like codedirectory.customer.comcode.  Now if I apply that logic to codeadmin.directory.customer.comcode, Rails things codedirectorycode is part of the subdomain, so I have to do thisp  precodeconstraint subdomain gt admin.   scope module gt admin     defaults subdomain gt admin codepre  pThis is great, just match any subdomain that stats with admin, BUT when it comes to using the url helpers, its NOT great, because the default subdomain Ive set codeadmincode doesnt include the customers portion of the subdomain codedirectorycode.p  pSetting the host option to codedirectory.customer.comcode doesnt seem to fix this, the url helper still returns codeadmin.customer.comcode.  Is there any way to set it up so url helpers know that the codedirectory.customer.comcode is all part of the host and the subdomain shouldnt overwrite that part of the host name  Theres got to be a method I can modify or something to make it keep that host name intact, rightp

Negative 691 pIve been reading for a while on how I can persist application settings over subsequent application loads. My application is a Winforms app.p  pI know there are several ways I can do this, and coming from a Delphi background I always used to use code.inicode files, but I can see XML is probably more flexible for my particular scenario.p  pIm considering two possible solutions for my application to persist its settings. Note that I cannot use the Properties.Settings method for storing my data because of two reasonsp  ul liThe data I need to persist is created dynamically, that is I may have 1,2,10 instances of my various classes at runtime note that each one has its own Nameli liSome of these classes I instantiate are created from a class library separate project which doesnt have a Settings section in my applicationli liI dont want to have to create 100s if not 1000s of settings in the Properties.Settings.li ul  pMy two possible solutions are as followsp  ol liCreate an abstract class to manage writing and retreiving settings by providing methods to codegetcode and codesetcode data, e.g. codeGetBooleanInstanceName,Setting, bool defaultcode and codeSetBooleanInstanceName,Settingcode. Each class that needs to be persisted can then implement this abstract class, so, when instantiated, reads its settings from the provided file and saves settings when specific properties change. li liMark my desired properties in each class as codeSerializablecode, and when instantiated, ensure the creating class object calls a codeLoadSettingsstring filenamecode method on the class which loads the desired codeSerializedcode settings from the supplied file, and writes updates when codeSaveSettingsstring filenamecode is called. I could be using an codeIPersistentcode interface for example, which my classes can implement.li ol  pI was hoping someone can point me to which method I should pursue.p  pNote that I need the ability to only persist certain properties in each instance of each class. I cannot see anyway of automating this, and will have to do this manually.p  pNote that these objects are instantiated at runtime, so I do knot know in advance what objects need to be persisted, only the specific properties within them. Consider the following examplep  pLets say I have a codeSerialcode class my own with some wrapper propertiesmethods etc around the codeSystem.IO.SerialPortcode class. The user, at runtime, may need 1,2,x number of serial ports available to them. I need some way to save the number of serial ports in use, and for each one, save their codeNamecode, codePortnumbercode, codeBaudcode, codeParitycode etc properties. p  pSo, given a XML file, I need to be able to read info that the application needs to create two serial ports, 1 called codeGPS1code and the other called codeGPS2code. For codeGPS1code the codePortnumbercode is codeCOM1code and for codeGPS2code the codePortnumbercode is codeCOM2code etc etc. p  pAlas, the amount of data to be serialized is significant, this is only an example. I can envisage storing in the realm of tens to hundreds of objectsinstances, each with ten or so settings.p  hr  pSome important features that I requirep  pThe functionality to optionally let the user choose the settings file, so that I provide the ability to create settings profiles which the user can load and save to separate files.  Each file can be moved from machine to machine. So, for example, if the user creates a profile on a PC, and then needs to change the PC out with another one, heshe can simply copy the file and load the same settings.p  pI typically only need to store primitive types codestringcode, codeintcode, codefloatcode, codebooleancode,etc, although obviously the ability to store more complex types is an advantage.p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction Or if my two solutions are not viable, suggest anotherp

Negative 691 pI am making a game similar to Terraria with XNA 4.0 in C with tiles and entities. I have created functions that calculate using axis aligned bounding boxes if an NPC or such will collide with a tile at the current velocity.p  pIn want a function that calculates the position of the axis aligned rectangle when it first hits a tile the tiles are stored in an 2d array and each tile is 1 unit long and half a tile is 0.5 and so on, It is basically like traversing from where the rectangle currently is to where it will be until it hits a tile and returning the position. I would prefer something more processing efficient for higher framerate.p  pI tried making it so that if the object will collide at its current velocity then it doesnt move. But if the object it moving fast then it causes it to stop short of a possible collision. Anyway I want the information about where the rectangle first collided for making objects bounce around and so on and for making things not be able to go through walls etc.p  pThis question is pretty specific and if I need to clarify anything tell me.p

Negative 691 pIs it necessary to use non Retina assets in new apps p  pI am asking because they take up considerable space and theyre a significant time sink in my design workflow. Nowadays in late 2012, the only supported nonretina devices are steadily dying out. According to my stats code13.8code of my users were on codeiPhone 3GS or oldercode including older iPhones and iPod Touches 3rd gen and below during the month of September.p  pIm not asking whether its a good idea or not sometimes its good to create less detailed artwork for lower res devices. p  pstrongI just want to know whether only including 2x assets will work reliably on nonRetina displays and whether theres any implicationsstrongp
Negative 691 pThese group of links are my nav elements. codevar makebuttonactivecode removes and inserts class active once clicked into the link.

I would like that once this is clicked the class active is removed from the links inside the codeul.menucode. This way the nav elements wont remain colored in orange when home is clicked.

Negative 691 pIve noticed that a few of my classmates have actually tried asking questions about this same assignment on StackOverflow over the past few days so Im going to shamelessly copy paste only the context of one question that was deleted but still cached on Google with no answers to save time. I apologize in advance for that.p  pstrongContextstrongbr I am trying to write a C program that measures the data throughput MBytessec of the L2 cache of my system. To perform the measurement I have to write a program that copies an array A to an array B, repeated multiple times, and measure the throughput.p  pConsider at least two scenariosp  ul liBoth fields fit in the L2 cacheli liThe array size is significantly larger than the L2 cache size.li ul  pUsing memcpy from string.h to copy the arrays, initialize both arrays with some values e.g. random numbers using rand, and repeat at least 100 times, otherwise you do not see a difference.p  pThe array size and number of repeats should be input parameters. One of the array sizes should be half of my L2 cache size.p  pstrongQuestionstrongbr So based on that context of the assignment I have a good idea of what I need to do because it pretty much tells me straight out. The problem is that we were given some template code to work with and Im having trouble deciphering parts of it.

Can I get any confirmation that this is rightli ul  pThese are the only hurdles in my understanding of this assignment. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.p

Is that because this is simply assumed Also, how do you know whether to delete or free Does one have to do research to find out what language each function was originally in, and then assume that all C programs use mallocfree and C uses newdeletep

PHP loads SESSION[] w chkbxs statesli liServer then process the link call using the data in SESSION[] to determine what column data to return and display in result in a tableli ol  pI CAN achieve this IF I put a break point at the last member assign of the getJSON call and single stepping it.  Without the singlestep, the getJSON call doesnt seem to happen  so the chkbxs values dont get transmitted to the server. Can anyone explain this behavior  Is there a better way to approach the problem  Any thoughts would be appreciated.  p  pThis is the code in the head section of the index.php file that calls the function that will do the getJSON callp  precodewindow.onbeforeunload, function indexFormUnload  this saves the state of the SELECT checkboxes   codepre  pThis is the code that constructs the getJSON call  it resides in a separate file included in the index.php filep  precodefunction indexFormUnload var ckBxValues  input.serializeArray .getJSONajaxJQserver.php,  server page called by jquery   Data sent via ajaxJQ callingForm index, callingElementID  null, locStorage ckBxValues, callingState unload, tableName null     codepre

Negative 691 pIm trying to implement the following feature A webpage with many lines such as codeType.classnamecom.long.qualified.class.Namecode, where the line corresponds to an entry in a Java properties file.  Each such line references a file named contextRoot...path...Name.java.p  pI want to be able to copy the filename easily, so I can in Eclipse locate the source file referenced by the property.  So, Im making the package name a codeltlabelgtcode and the class name an codeltinputgtcode, connecting them with a codeforcode.  Then I added an codeonfocuscode to the class name, in which I do codethis.selectcode.  I also added styling to make the text field not look like a text field, i.e. font, bordernone, readonly not CSS.p  pMy first question is how do I set the width of the text field to the full width of its emoriginalem content.  Other questions had answers about adjusting the width dynamically  this is not an issue for me.  Can it be done with CSS, or do I have to use javascript.  There are over 1000 such lines, and Id rather not use more script than I need to.p  pMy second question is am I doing these the hard way, and theres an easier way to accomplish my goal, or is this pretty much the way anyone else would do itp  pThanks.p

Negative 691 pI am new to Lucene, do not have enough time to go through the entire documentation. We are using Lucene highlighter to highlight matches. As far I know Lucene itself is using JFlex engine for it.  Current task requires introduction of new language support.. According to requirements word like  should match  and vice versa. People while typing a message usually avoid usage of accents and therefore word with accent must match same word without accent. So, my question is whether we can specify somewhere in Lucene or JFlex character transformation rules like U038AU03B9   Any help will be appreciated. p

Negative 691 pIm having a dilemma where Im trying to pass a string through popen in C, but have it maintain the double quotes in the string. The string reads as followsp  precodessh ss grep c s ss codepre  pI need to run this command so it greps from a log on a remote system and returns the count for it. Im passing different arguments to through the string, so it generates the username and password as well as the search string and target. However, the search string contains multiple words separated by whitespace characters, so I need the double quotes intact so it parses out the search string correctly. However, so far popen has been stripping the double quotes from the string so the search doesnt complete. Im not sure of another way to do the remote ssh command, or of keeping the double quotes in the statement. Any ideasp  pThanksp  pEDIT Here is the full sprintf statement Im using to generate the string as well as the popen command.p  precodesprintfcommand, ssh ss grep c s ss, user, server, search, path, file fd  popencommand, r codepre

Negative 691 pIf I call codetoSeqcode on an immutable codeSetcode collection I get an codeArrayBuffercode.p  precodescalagt Set1,2,3.toSeq  returns Seq[Int]  ArrayBuffer1, 2, 3 codepre  pThis surprises me. Given Scalas emphasis on using immutable data structures, I expect to get back an immutable sequence like a codeVectorcode or codeListcode instead of a mutable codeArrayBuffercode. The returned ordering of the set elements should of course be undefined, but there doesnt seem to be any semantic reason why that ordering should also be mutable.p  pIn general, I expect Scala operations to always produce immutable results unless I explicitly request a mutable one. This has been my assumption all along, but it is an incorrect one here, and I actually just spent an hour debugging a problem where the unexpected presence of an codeArrayBuffercode led to a runtime error in a codematchcode statement. My fix was to change codeSet....toSeqcode to codeSet....toListcode, but this feels like a hack because theres nothing about my application that requires a list in particular at that point.p  pIs having codeSet....toSeqcode return a mutable object a flaw in Scalas implementation, or is there a principle I am misunderstanding herep  pThis is Scala 2.9.2.p

The user just moves effortlessly between the five TabControllers, submitting results to a server frequently.  Its possible that submitting each task might take 20 seconds or so.

Negative 691 pHow much row do you recommend to use in this layout. I think Im doing something wrong because I can not get the location of the codeSPAN 4 SPAN 4 INTO ROWcodep  pa hrefhttpimgur.comZdrHrTN relnofollowhttpimgur.comZdrHrTNap
Negative 691 pIm going to be writing a strongLinuxstrong client that will make a socket connection to five or so servers.  The client will send a line a string followed by n to each one, and will receive a line back from each one.p  pId like to use strongselectstrong or strongepollstrong in the client however, this being TCP and streambased, Im not guaranteed to have an entire line in the system buffer when the strongselectstrong pops.  What Im looking for is a library that provides an API similar to strongepollstrong and strongsysreadstrong, but works on the basis of entire stronglinesstrong of data being buffered and ready to read.p  pIm surprised not to have been able to find anything like this in my Internet searches  I would have thought this was a fairly common need.  Maybe I havent worded the problem correctly.  It doesnt seem too difficult to write, but Id suspect that an opensource solution would be more bulletproof.p

Negative 691 pIs there a way of retrieving event info and UI element data from an external Java desktop application  Specifically, I need to log when the value of a specific textbox changes and retrieve data from several other input elements.p  pThis is for a proofofconcept project for a customer not malware.  p  pThe Java application already exists and cannot be added to or recompiled.

Negative 691 pHeres my issue.  My company needs a vendor database added to our wordpress website.  None of the existing plugins will even come close to what we need, and we already have a mysql database with all of our information, so we need to create a plugin or something to do what we need.p  pThese urls need to be directaccessible and have SEF urls.  So, for examplep  precodemysite.comvendors mysite.comvendorspipemanufacturers mysite.comvendorbobspipes codepre  pAnd, the custom content needs to appear inside the wordpress template.p  pThere are really 2 optionsp  p1 Find a way to write our application outside of wordpress, but find a way to bootstrap wordpress to show the header, footer, and sidebar.  p  p2 Run the app from inside wordpress.p  pSo I went for option 2.  I created a new template file named vendor.php, and began working.  I added this code to my functions.php of my themep  precodeaddfilter templateinclude, xyztemplatecheck   function xyztemplatecheck      global template      rqst  SERVER[REQUESTURI]      ra  split, rqst      if ra[1]  vendors           templatefile  getstylesheetdirectory . vendors.php         return templatefile            return template    codepre  pSo what the above code does, if it sees the word vendors as the first part of the url after the site name, it sends you to vendor.php.  This works PERFECTLY....p  pexcept...p  pWordpress believes that the page is not found.  It returns a 404 header, and NOT FOUND into the page title and breadcrumb.p  pAdding a PAGE called Vendor Database with the permalink vendors fixes the main page.  But there will be literally hundreds of vendors and different categories.  I cant be creating a custom page for each one.  This needs to be dynamic.p  pSo, how do I make wordpress give a 200, and supply an acceptable page title, breadcrumb, etc.  p  pDont even get me started on the danged wptitle filter.  This did NOT work as documented.  Although, it just occurred to me that this might be an issue with Wordpress SEO the wptitle filter issue.p  pAnyone got an idea on thisp
Negative 691 pIm trying to develop a windows forms application that captures snapshots of scree, displays them dynamically as they are captured and I would also like to provide the functionality to delete the captured images too.

Negative 691 pI am currently trying to merge some changes done in VB6 code with Visual Studio 2012. p  pThe merge tool automagically removes Set in front of assignments, Variant is changed to Object and calls to Sub methods automagically gets parenthesises  inserted around the arguments.

Negative 691 pI use Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery Masonry for a new site in developement.

What Id like to achieve is that the elements only display when they reached their destination place. I dont want to disable animations, but the space for the new element should appear empty and only when everything is rearranged through masonry the new element should appear.p  pI thought there would be a callbackaction that fires after reload like thisp  precodeposts.masonryreload,function   alertrealigning finished  codepre  pbut that doesnt work, it fires to early.p  pSo for the moment, I didp  precodeposts.masonryreload,function   window.setTimeoutshowElem,500  function showPosts   .post.show  codepre  pand that seems to work  but a fixed 500ms timeout is not a real beautiful solution...p  pSo, any suggestionsp

Negative 691 pSo, Im running into this issue and maybe Im just not thinking straight, but examples of how sites have handled this would help.p  pI want to use the HTML5 date input  its nice and smooth. However, I need that date to get eventually put in as a date field in a mysql database. The issue is not with the post value from HTML5 date input  but rather when its reverting back to text on older browsers.p  pIf I say Please format YYYYMMDD by my input this will be a highly public application visited from many browsers, then when using Chrome which is showing the date picker, Chrome auto formats to MMDDYYYY for the displayed date and I hear that is localized to the user. p  pQuestion is this How to put a Please format YYYYMMDD label which will only show up when it has reverted to a text box If I specify to the end user that they need to format it one way, and the date picker only allows them to do it a different way, wont that be hopelessly confusing I anticipate this form being used from multiple locales so I cant anticipate the default formatting.p  pPlease note this is a front end question I understand how to take the POST values, but need the POST values of the backwards compatible text boxes to be uniform.  p
Negative 691 pI am developing an opensource browser called Lightning Browser, and I have run into some trouble with the most recent update to Android 4.2.2.p  pWebViews will fail to render completely until the view is touched. It only occurs on the latest Android version. On 4.2.1, the WebView rendered completely fine. I use my Nexus 7 for development and right after I received the 4.2.2 update, the browser stopped rendering. Other users experienced this as well, and it was confirmed multiple times to happen ONLY on 4.2.2. It is happening targeting API level 16 and 17, but I have seen a WebKit browser that targets API level 9 without this problem.p  pI have attempted to remedy this using the solution to a problem I found here on Stack Overflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13500452androidwebviewrendersblankwhiteviewdoesntupdateoncsschangesorhtmlAndroid WebView renders blankwhite, view doesn39t update on css changes or HTML changes, animations are choppya. HOWEVER, setting the WebViews RenderPriority to high alone does not solve it... the only way to get it to render without being touched was to place the invalidate command inside the OnDraw method of WebView. This causes the WebView to redraw continuously. This works sort of, animations are smooth, the page loads very quickly, but it causes the WebViews performance to drop otherwise. p  pI have also seen this question very similar to mine, but there is no good answer for it. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10387345androidwebviewfailstocompletelyrendercontentuntiluserinteractionAndroid WebView Fails to Completely Render Content Until User Interactionap  pBy performance drop, I mean input. Text input lags, and the WebView itself cannot handle what is going on as well as before. Benchmarking the browser with the invalidate method call drops Benchmarking performance by around 8. I know benchmarks arent everything, but its telling me that the continuous drawing is straining the system and causing the system to ignore other tasks.p  pIn Conclusion... The WebView in Android 4.2.2 will not render until touched. The only way I know to fix this is to call invalidate in the onDraw method of WebView. This is bad for performance and I am looking for a different way to fix this.p  pThe Magic Code Im currently using... p  precodeclass MyWebView extends WebView      Override     onDrawCanvas canvas              invalidate          super.OnDrawcanvas       codepre  premovep  precodeinvalidate codepre  pand it doesnt render until touched.p  pDoes anyone have a suggestions on how make the WebView render other than what Ive done By the way, this is my first question Ive asked here on Stack, so forgive me if I havent been clear or if Ive done something wrong. p  pEDIT I found this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11344125androidchromiumdiskcacheerrorcorruptindexfileherea about a similar issue and it was resolved, the problem is, I dont understand what the answer even means.

Sadly, this didnt really help me at all, since no matter what functions Id use  like codeDwmEnableBlurBehindWindowcode , none of them would actually affect the taskbar in a way that I wanted them to. I even tried turning the alpha levels of the taskbars owner window down, but sadly that didnt work either  It made the taskbar emiconsem transparent too which is a nono for me, and it didnt actually remove the blur it just made the effect weaker.p  pAs it seems that my skills are not enough to accomplish this task, Im asking you  how can I remove the Aero blur from the Windows 7 taskbar Possibly using Cp

Negative 691 pIn my application, I have a type responsible for computations that may involve large numbers and a type that is used for communication between processors.p  precodetypedef MyBigIntegerClass bigInt typedef int smallInt codepre  pThe communication part ist not compatible with MyBigIntegerClass, so before communicating e.g. a vector of bigInts it has to be converted to smallints.

This is why I allow a configuration such asp  precodetypedef int32t bigInt typedef int16t smallInt codepre  pThe bigInt type still is sufficiently large for the computation stuff.

Negative 691 pI have a set of highly nonlinear, implicit ODEs and I need to use an implicit solver such as ode15i to integrate the equations. In order to use ode15i, you must acquire consistent initial conditions for the derivatives and dependent variables. MATLAB has a built in function, decic, that can calculate the consistent ICs, however, when I execute the function, I get the following errorp  pConvergence failure in DECIC.p  pNow, generally, if your equations are inconsistent, decic will give you a warning asking you to free up some of the variables of Y0. But in my case, I dont think I have inconsistent equations, but Im not really sure why the convergence failure error is showing up and how to fix it. There isnt a whole lot of documentation online about it. Im including a selfcontained code below with all the necessary values to run it. Since this is a very specific issue, I cant really shorten the code or give a simplified example.

Negative 691 pAlthough I found many posts with this same error, I couldnt find if my error is fixable or not.p  pThere is a database which I have read permission with my window login on the network. I just use SSMS to access the table but that isnt really have the best interface in the world so I wrote a small website that can connect to the table and filter the data I want and display them nicely.p  pI use Integrated Security  SSPI also tried TRUE and it all works fine until this point. I run the website using VS2010. But running a website using VS2010 isnt really ideal thing to do so I put my website on IIS 7 on my machine i.e. Localhostxxx. And thiss when I got the above error. p  pAll those issues can be fixed if I can just get a user in the database with only a read permission to the table I want to read but that isnt simply possible in my case. There is nothing i can change with the database. p  pSo is there any work around to host the website on local IIS with a connection string that uses integrated security and connects to a remote database with window login credentialp  pThanks.p

Negative 691 pIm working on a multiplayer module of my game engine. I dont have any code to post because both the server and the client are sending and receiving what I want, so this is a much more theoretical question. Ive been trying to find the answer on the internet, but nothing has seemed to point me in the right direction.p  pBasically, I have a base server that one is able to connect to in order to see stats, connect to other GAME servers, and so on. This entire clientserver model is TCP. However, the problem comes with my game server. In this case, TCP connection between all players and the server is established on a certain port, and I send packets to and from the server on another port through UDP. The reason for this is that so I can seperate important messages from less important State updates. Locally, this works fine, however when I try this over the internet, the packets are sent but not received.p  pThe TCP connection does get established over the internet, but the UDP packets do not arrive at their location. I have tried adding rules in Windows Firewall outbound and inbound, and Ive done port forwarding on all systems. I know for a fact its not a problem with my code.p  pBoth systems are running on 64bit Windows 7. Im sending 64 Byte packets 40 times a second and not one is getting through, so its not a packet drop problem.p  pstrongFinally, my question isstrong What are some other things that could block UDP packets What are things that I need to take into consideration Im past the forgetting to bind stage and such.p  pI understand that this is a very theoretical question and broad question, but Im not sure what else to do as the problem does not lie within the code any more. I must be missing something simple. Any recommendations or advice is greatly appreciated. Again, sorry for how broad the question is, but this is my last resort.p  pThanksp

These include, but are not limited top  precodeobject eclipse is not a member of package org not found value JQueryModule codepre  pGoogling errors like this I see a lot of stuff from a year ago, largely which seems to be a package mismatch. From this research I was able to make some changes reflected in the build.sbt, etc. abovep  ul liUpgrade scala version to 2.10.1li liUpgrade lift version to 2.5li liUse sbteclipse 2.2 pluginli ul  pYet Im still receiving these errors. To verify I have updated, from the sbt terminal console, and run the eclipse build from there as well. I imported the project to Eclipse after that point. I am unable to determine where the package mismatches are coming from or indeed why they cant be discovered, since they exist on the system and sbt can find them. Is this an eclipse IDE plugin weakness, or a solvable problem Or, in my obvious newness to Scala Lift, am I missing something really obviousp
Negative 691 pIm pretty new to MVC so forgive me if Im missing anything.p  pIn one of my controllers, I initiate a class that does some processing and outputs a string like thisp  precode[HttpPost] public ActionResult Checkstring reg      string sCarmodel     GetRegInfo gri  new GetRegInforeg, out sCarmodel     Session[test]  sCarmodel      return ViewCheck  codepre  pSo far so good, and the output of sCarmodel is correctly stored in Session where it can be accessed later in the View. However, I need to put the class in a separate thread, since it takes some time to finish it and I want to return the View aschyncronosly. So I tried thisp  precode[HttpPost] public ActionResult Checkstring reg      var getreginfoThread  new Thread          gt                      string sCarmodel             GetRegInfo gri  new GetRegInforeg, out sCarmodel             Session[test]  sCarmodel                        getreginfoThread.Start      return ViewCheck  codepre  pI know that I can store the value of sCarmodel in a database from within the class itself, but I was looking for a way to skip using a database. Using a thread, the value of sCarmodel is not stored in Session, and the Session is codenullcode later when I try to retrieve it.p  pCan anybody offer some advice on how I can access a value from a Class while in a threadp  pThanksp  pstrongEditstrong Problem solved, thanks everybody for their suggestionsp

Negative 691 pUsing a value converter in WPF, you can return something like codeDependecyProperty.UnsetValuecode or codeBinding.DoNothingcode as special values to say leave the binding alone. Is there a similar mechanism in MVVMCross p  pTo be more specific about what Im trying to do, is I have a view model property that is a threestate enum that I need to bind to 3 binary controls. So I thought I could bind each of the controls to a codeMyEnumcode  codeboolcode converter that will have a conversion parameter set to the value of the converter and in the codeConvertcode method it will return true if the codeMyEnumcode state is equal to the parameter and false otherwise. So far so good. But I want this binding to be twoway, so I need to convert back. My convert back works something like thisp  precode    protected override MyEnum ConvertBackbool value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture              if parameter is MyEnum                      if value                              return MyEnumparameter     this is fine                          else                              return                                return base.ConvertBackvalue, targetType, parameter, culture      codepre  pBasically, what I want to be able to do is say, if the state of my control is codetruecode update the bound property on my view model to be the same as the parameter, if not, leave the view model property alone. p  pMaybe this is the problem with using the strongly typed value convertersp

Negative 691 pThis is a fairly rudimentary question but one that I am kind of on the fence about. Lets say I have a class A and it has methods method1,method2,method3,method4 and a main method.p  pmethod2 is only invoked by method1 method4 is only invoked by method3. p  pThe solution says to invoke the method1 from main and also method2 from main and same with method3 and 4.p  pSo isnt it bad design to have the main method invoke method1, and method2 explicitly What is the point of having private methods in a class if you invoke them in the main method even though they are only dependent on a single method in the whole classp  pWouldnt it be cleaner to call method2 from method1 and method4 from method3 since in both cases the latter method is only invoked by the formerp  pI thought this was the whole point of helper methods, so that we are able to abstract away unnecessary details of the implementation.p  pAgain my apologies for the simplicity of the question, I am quite new to java.p  precodeClass A   public static void mainString[] args     int x  method1     if  x  0                   user wants to create a new account     method2           private static int method1    some code to check user login credentials in list of users   if login credentials fail,user is asked if they want to create a new account, if yes,   method 2 is invoked   return value is whether the user wants to create a new account or not.  private static void method2    creates new account for user and is only invoked by method1.  codepre  pp  pIn the above case wouldnt it just be easier to call method2 from method1 instead of calling it in the main. I would like to know if there are any advantages or disadvantages of this style of implementation.p

I have found in russian mathematical forum a hrefhttpforum.sources.ruindex.phpshowtopic241460ampviewfindpostampp1995554 relnofollowan algorithma p  precodeProcedure FX,Y X set of included vertices  Y set of forbidden vertices to construct new subgraph 1.if Xk, then return 2.construct a set T[X] of vertices that adjacent to vertices from X If X is a empty set, than T[X]V, but not belong to the sets X,Y 3.Y1Y 4.Foreach v from T[X] do 4.1.X1Xv 4.2.show subgraph X1 4.3.FX1,Y1 4.4.Y1Y1v  Initial call FX,Y X, Y  empty set FX,Y  codepre  pThe main idea of this algorithm is using forbidden set so that, this one doesnt require pruning, author of this algorithm said that it is 300 times more quickly than solution based on pruning equals subgraphs.

On the webpage they have, it lets us manage our phones and even make them call othersusing javascript but I have no idea how since their code is insanely complex. p  pMy plan was that if a user clicked on someones office, they could then have a button that would ask them to enter their number and pin to log inhow it works on the lightpath website, it would connect their 2 phones. I intended to use their number and pin to log in for them, and have the call connect that way, by just controlling the forms on lightpaths site, while it was in an iframe. This way, they wouldnt see Lightpaths sites clutterbecause I could hide the iframe, and it would just get done. Essentially, it would happen as if they had gone to the website themselves and done it that way, except in a much more approachable format, and with less distractions.p  pLightPath does offer a call me feature which creates a dedicated button for calling a specific person, but it creates a token for them, and only that person has the ability to create it, not to mention I would have to enter each persons unique token into the site, and run the risk of it failing should their extension get changed, or they leave the company.

Even if one of the plugins, lets call it  contact.jquery..js  is not executed on every page  about.php, index.php  and runs only in contact.php and not always reached by the user. p  pThe logic says  if you load all scripts and styles one time from the first page index.php the loading of the scripts on the second page contact.php will be cached and will be loaded quickly.p  pBUTp  pWhen i load all scripts from header, my first page is really slow , but when i load 1 script from another page without putting a script to header it doesnt take a lot of time to load , because its just one jquery script.p  pSo here goes no logic, if i seperate scripts on pages where it used, the speed is proportional to pages what user uses. p  pSo what is the best way p  ul liTo separate scripts by frequency of visits on pages and put scripts on separated pagesli liStill load everything from the index page. li liSeparate all scripts to different pages and put them to footer.li liUse all scripts in header on the first page but do not let reload some scripts on pages where specific script is used. li liload all plugins from header , in all pages , in a single JS file li liuse loader like headjs or yepnopeli ul  pps for the styles its the same  contact.css will be loaded from the first page or better from the contact.php. I think for css its better from index, but for scripts im confused. p

Negative 691 pIm developing a app that will showcase products. One of the features of this app is that you will be able to rotate the product, using your fingerPanGesture.p  pI was thinking in implementing this by taking photos of the product from different angles so when you drag the image, all I would have to do is switch the image according. If you drag a little, i switch only 1 image... if you drag a lot, i will switch them in cadence making it look like a movie... but i have a concerns and a probable solutionp  ul liIs this performatic Since its a artmuseum product showcase, the photos will be quite large in sizedefinition, and loadingswitching when dragged a lot might be a problem because it would cause flickering... And the solution would be instead of loading picbypic i would put them all inside one massive sheet, and work through them as if they were a sprite...li ul  pIs that a good ideia Or should I stick with the picbypic rotationp  pstrongEdit 1strong Theres a complicator the user will be able to zoom inout and to rotate the product in any axis X, Y and Z...p

Negative 691 pSo this might need to be filed under youre doing it wrong but I cannot get the OAuth accesstoken returned by the default VS2013 MVC5WebApi project template to successfully authenticate a WebApi request.

Highlight that request and click on the Inspectors tab and then view the Headers of the Response.li liCopy and paste the Location header under the Transport section into Notepad and then copy only the value of the accesstoken fragment.li liIn Fiddler, click the Composer tab and modify the default URL to be the URL for the controller action you created in step 3 above.li lipIn the Request Headers area add the following below the UserAgent headerp  precodeAuthorization Bearer [accesstoken] codepre  pwhere [accesstoken] is the value you copied from step 8 above.pli lipExecute the request and you should see HTTP 200 in the Fiddler trace. Viewing the Raw response in the Inspectors tab should show the values you returned from the WebApi method.pli ol  pIf you follow steps 111 above with the only change being you choose an MVCWebApi with Individual User Accounts as the authentication type then you will get an HTTP 401 in step 11 instead of HTTP 200 with the appropriate return data.p  pHaving said all that, am I doing it wrong As far as I can tell, the two project templates are nearly identical with regards to the OAuthsecurity setup some minor differences in web.config but changing those didnt seem to make a difference.p  pThanks in advance for any help you may provide  Ive been banging my head on the desk for the past couple nights...p  pRyanp

Negative 691 pin my activity, I have a spinner. When I click on it, another activity is started the main one is not destroyed, in the new activity the user choose a text, press a button and the activity is destroyed, so the old activity is put in the front  onResume  and the text chosen is inserted into the spinner.p  pThe problem is that if I want to do something, i need to click everywhere on the screen one time, then i can press buttons, scroll listviews etc.. If I click buttons for example, they are not pressed, seems like the activity need to get focus first I dont understand why so the only thing that ive seen in the LogCat is the warning p  precodeWindow already focused, ignoring focus gain of... codepre  pThe onClick method of the button in the second activity is thisp  precodeActivityOne.stringtoupdate  selection finish codepre  pThis return to the main activity. The main activityActivityOne set then the new text stringtoupdate to the spinner by adding the string to an arraylist and assigning then the arraylist to the spinners adapter In the onResume .p  pWhich is the problem and how to solve it Thank you allp

Negative 691 pIve been assigned the task of importing about 180 csv files into an access 2007 database.  These files have been put together over the years and will be put into 1 of 3 folders.  I have not set up any data checks or restrictions to these tables such as primary keys, validation rules, or relationships.  That will be done once the data has been imported.  The data contained in these files are from a survey which has changed over the years.  This change has caused the fields to change.  The order of them has changed or sometimes a field is there and sometimes it is not.  I do have a list of all the fields possible though and what table each csv file should be imported to, and know that all these fields can be text.  p  pHere is my problem  Not knowing what the order of the columns or if a column will exist, is it possible to run a function to import these text files into their relative tables by mapping each column in the text file to its associated column in the access table  p  pEach text file has headers which is useful to see shat they actually are, but there is no text qualifier which can be very annoying when dealing with id codes consisting entirely of numbers.  Below is what Ive tried so far.  It gets the file location from a function elsewhere, adds each filename in that location to a collection, then for each file in that collection it tries to import it into its relative field.p  precode    Get file names from the folder and store them in a collection temp  Dirlocation amp .

Negative 691 pCurrently, I am doing a CS102 project. Since I am quite beginner, I made a Fitness Assistant which creates a exercise program and diet based on user inputs.p  pI created most of the GUI with Netbeans because it is easy. In my project, I needed to add quite a few images to the GUI panels the pictures of exercises etc. , which I put in the main directory of the project and in the code I added picture.jpg as their addresses. Also, I need to do a lot of txt read and write operations, and similarly, for the addresses of the txt files I added textfile.txt in the code, and add the txt files to the main directory of project, too.p  pIn Netbeans when I press the run project, it works perfectly as Intented, without any issues. All pictures are shown, all txts are read without any issue and outputsthe diet and the workout list are added to the JFrames. By the way, in my project there are 3 different JFrames which will connected each other with buttons. First the welcome frame and start button, when the button is clicked first panel becomes invisible and second ,the user input frame, becomes visible then when the users finishes the inputs they click a proceed button, then the third and last frame becomes visible and the input frame becomes invisible, and users can see their workout plan and diet created for them.p  pBut the thing is, our instructor told us to make projects as some sort of executable which he will click on and run on his computer and it should work. However, when I built the .jar file from Netbeans, and tried to run it it doesnt work at all. First issue is when I clicked the button nothing happens, second frame doesnt open. First frame becomes invisible. And also the .jpg pictures I added that works perfectly on Netbeans run project, are not shown. I added all of the pictures with hard coding them in the code, not by right clickproperties and add icon with Netbeans Also I make .jar a .rar and look inside of it,inside of it there were no .jpg files and .txt files which are absolutely essantial for the way I wrote my code.p  pSo, my question is, is there a way to make my project an executable not neccesarily an .exe , anything that can work without netbeans installed is fine I know I have probably fu.. up everything when I add .jpgs and .txts Sorry for the long post, I hope you can understand it. And also, if you want to see the project file I can send it with PMs or something, I dont think I should add it here since it is an assignment.p  pThanks.p  pTLDR The .jar file created by Netbeans does not work as it works on Netbeans. .jpgs are not imported which were on the main directory of the project, also opening a new jframe by a button does not work either. Program runs completely fine on Netbeansp

Negative 691 pIm developing a GUI test library of sorts using PySide and Qt. So far it works quite nicely when the test case requires waiting for only one condition to happen such as a signal or a timeout, but my problem is having to wait for multiple conditions to happen before proceeding with data verification.p  pThe test runner works in its own thread so as not to disturb the main thread too much. Waiting for signalstimeouts happens with an event loop, and this is the part that works nicely simplified examplep  pre classlangpython prettyprintoverridecode Create a  simple event loop and fail timer to prevent infinite waiting loop  QtCore.QEventLoop failtimer  QtCore.QTimer failtimer.setIntervalMAXDELAY failtimer.setSingleShotTrue failtimer.timeout.connectloop.quit   Connect waitable signal to event loop condition.connectloop.quit  condition is for example QLineEdit.textChanged signal   Perform test action testwidget.doStuff.emit  Function not called directly, but via signals   Wait for condition, or fail timeout, to happen loop.exec   Verify data assert expectedvalue  testwidget.readValue codepre  pThe waiting has to be synchronous, so an event loop is the way to go, but it does not work for multiple signals. Waiting for any of multiple conditions is of course possible, but not waiting for multiple conditionssignals to all have happened. So any advice on how to proceed with thisp  pI was thinking about a helper class that counts the number of signals received and then emits a readysignal once the required count is reached. But is this really the best way to go The helper would also have to check each sender so that only one instance of a specific signal is accounted for.p
Negative 691 pI am reading C primer Plus 5th edition and I am in the IO chapter. I come up with an example page 451 that do some stuff and in some point it creates a new file which is named after a existing file but with an .red ending. For example if I have this file test, the programme creates a test.red. I cannot understand the following..p  precodechar name[LEN] some code...  strncpyname,argv[1], LEN  5 name[LEN  5]  0 strcatname,.red codepre  pI looked the definition of the command strcpy. It copies the first LEN5 characters from the arv[1] it contains the source file to the name. The strcat command adds the .red to the end. However, I cannot understand the existence of this codename[LEN  5]  0code. I removed it and the program still working good.brstrongEDITstrong br I post the comment from the book for these lines..p  blockquote   pTo construct the new name for the output file, the program uses   strncpy to copy the name eddy into the array name. The LEN  5   argument leaves room for the .red suffix and the final null character.   No null character is copied if the argv[2] string is longer than LEN    5, so the program adds a null character just in case.

Negative 691 pI made a little research myself concerning the question that is it really neccessary to use equalizeHist before calling the detectMulticale function. I trained my classifier with discrete AdaBoost.p  pIf Im not mistaken, the main purpose of rescaling the histogram is to increase the contrast of the image.p  pI checked the detection results with only one image, but with different contrast ratios. I almost grayed out completly the image, but I didnt observed too much difference. Actually the difference was marginally Sometimes a false negative, sometimes a true positive popped out using the histogram equalizer. Maybe it was the image, but I observed that, when I started to lower the contrast, at the beginning mostly the false alerts started to disappear.p  pSo my question briefly is that Is it really neccessary to use equalizeHist before calling the detectMulticale.p

Negative 691 pI have an iOS application for a catalog that loads assets with no ActionScript from a remote server, so those assets a catalog, can be updated by the catalog editors in order to create a new issue of the catalog every month.p  pAir for iOS allows you to load SWF files without ActionScript code on them. So Im loading my assets from external SWF files and testing succesfully by compiling in Ad Hoc, or App Store modes.p  pSome of those assets are animated movieclips with intenal movieclips, several frames and motion animations which need to be instantiated several times a random number of times in the app, for an interactive feature.p  pstrongSOME BACKGROUNDstrongp  ul liThe standard way to create repeatable items is by assigning them a Linkage Class Name in the Flash IDE, which works fine for desktop apps, but this seems to be interpreted as code by iOS, so it is not imported when I load the assets, so the element can not be instantiated from the APP.li liThere are several attempts to replicate the old as2 duplicateMovieClip function but they dont duplicate internal movieclips, motions and internal movieclips. a hrefhttpwww.kirupa.comforumshowthread.php223798ActionScript3TipoftheDaypage12ampp1939827post1939827 relnofollowThis is an example.ali liIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6947294as3instantiatingobjectsfromexternalswfiniosrq1this questiona, they say its not possible and propose a solution in which the movieclip has to be included in the main app, but in that way the editors would not be able to update the graphics and the animations once the app is approved in the store. The whole point is to allow the editor to update the products catalog.li lia hrefhttpwww.newgrounds.combbstopic831704 relnofollowHere is an additional discussion about the topica.li ul  pstrongPOSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO EXPLOREstrongp  ul liIm thinking of implementing some kind of recursive iteration creating every DisplayObject from scratch, but I still cant find a concistent way to duplicate a shape created by the editor in the Flash UI. In fact, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10436701they say its not possible eithera, all that can be done is to create bitmap copies which is likely to be too heavy in processing specially if one create too many copies.li liI guess, probably the only way is to find some compilation hack to make let the external SWF define the new Class so the instance can be created in the main app. For now, the editor is not going to be able to change duplicable objects.li liThere is also the possibility of having the duplicable element in a separate SWF, and load it several times, but I dont know if that would work although that would be a little unglier for the designer.li liI also tried to serialize an unserialize the whole movieclip, but I have not been able to find a concistent method for that either.li ul  pstrongA note for the developers of Adobe Flash strong The ARMiOS implementation of the AS3 Loader class should be changed to include the linked classes in the execution context, because the developer expects to be able to instantiate movieclips with a linked class even if they are contained in an external SWF loaded from an iOS air application. Currently the instantiation fails in iOSair, but it works fine in desktop.  I understand that apple does not allow the execution of code loaded from the external SWF, but this is not code execution, this is just a Class linkage that can be used to create multiple instances of the movieclip from the actual application code.p  pCan anyone helpp

The prompt for the question is as follows p  pAs some of you may know, there is no name better than JOHN. Lets define the rules for comparing names. Each letter has a weight A  1, B  2, ..., Z  26.

When comparing two names, the one with the larger weight is considered better. In case of a tie, the one that comes earlier lexicographically is better.

Negative 691 pSo I have a form that has some custom made alerts created combined in CSS and PHP, now I call these alerts using echo and I use die at the end to killend the PHP script. Here is the PHP codep  precodeifpass1  pass2 echo ltdiv classalertgtPasswords do not matchltdivgt die  codepre  pand here is the CSSp  precode.alert          background fff6bf url..imagesexclamation.png center norepeat         backgroundposition 15px 50          textalign center         padding 5px 20px 5px 45px         bordertop 2px solid ffd324         borderbottom 2px solid ffd324          codepre  pThe problem is when the script is executed without die then is shows the error properly with the CSS. When die is implemented then the code shows a blank page that says Passwords do not match without any styling. p  pWhat can I do to kill the PHP script but still have stylingp  pSOLUTION p  pSo after seeing the answers and realizing that die kills the entire site at that point. I added a simple line to my codep  pBEFOREp  precode   ifpass1  pass2     echo ltdiv classalertgtPasswords do not matchltdivgt     die      codepre  pAFTERp  precode   ifpass1  pass2     echo ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssstructure.cssgt     echo ltdiv classalertgtPasswords do not matchltdivgt     die      codepre  pSo basically I appended just the stylesheet before the alert to make the alert have styling.  p

Negative 691 pTrying to get a better grasp of how an UITableViews works, so I provided a background question Im not sure about, which leads into my actual question belowp  p1 When a cell is first created, you include the p  precodeif cell      cell  [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifierCellIdentifier]  codepre  pblock to init the cell. After that, if you are reusing a cell, the ifstatement will be skipped and you will just use the previous cell you setup before for the new cell you are now creating be the deque method. Is that correctp  p2 Using Storyboard, I have a segmented control created in a prototype cell for two indices Attending and Not Attending, so every new cell creates a new segmented control. No index should be selected upon creation of a cell, however I was having trouble as an index would be selected when I added a new rowcell to the table. p  pLets take this scenario I create my first cell, Attending and Not Attending are both not selected as expected. Say now I select one of the indices, and now add a new rowcell to my table. The question I have is when I setup breakpoints and Im looking at the creation of a new cell, namely this step belowp  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath   ...      UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier forIndexPathindexPath] codepre  pAnd I look at my selectedIndex in the debugger, it stores the same selectedIndex value as the cell I just modified ie. Attending or Not Attending, whatever I selected before represented by 0 or 1. I guess this makes sense because I am dequeueing a reusablecell, so I guess the tags and such point to the previous cell I was able to solve this problem of resetting the new cell to have no index selected at creation by doing the followingp  pNote, the default selectedIndex for new event objectcell, labeled here asannouncements, is 2p  precode   set correct index     if [[self.announcements objectAtIndexindexPath.section] selectedIndex]  2         [attendingSegmentedControl setSelectedSegmentIndexUISegmentedControlNoSegment]          else          attendingSegmentedControl.selectedSegmentIndex  [[self.announcements objectAtIndexindexPath.section] selectedIndex]        codepre  pSo now when I create a new cell, even though the SegmentedControl selectedIndex is either 0 or 1 after I already selected in a previous cell, the initial selectedIndex for the strongobjectstrong is 2. Hence Im forcing the SegmentedContorls selectedIndex to change to nothing being selected. Is this the right approach here Been reading up on cell dequeing questions and this was the best solution I came up with myselfp

Negative 691 pI have a bamboo plan with a maven task. I need to pass a maven parameter with the name of the branch. I can use the variable codebamboo.repository.branch.namecode for this.p  pHowever, I need to override this value for some branches see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22072272howtoapplyaregextoabamboovariablehow to apply a regex to a bamboo variablea .p  pSo, in my bamboo plan I define a variable called codebranchNamecode, with value codebamboo.repository.branch.namecode. then, my maven task uses codebamboo.branchNamecode, and the branches can override the codebranchNamecode value when necessary.p  pSo, is this possible can my bamboo plan variable codebranchNamecode use another variable codebamboo.repository.branch.namecode as default valuep  pWell, I tried, and the result is unclear. If my maven task isp  precode  mvn verify B Dsonar.branchbamboo.branchName codepre  pthis does not work. it executes codemvn verify B Dsonar.branchbamboo.repository.branch.namecodep  pHowever,  If my maven task isp  precode  mvn verify B Dsonar.branchbamboo.branchName  Dignorevarbamboo.repository.branch.name codepre  pthen codebamboo.branchNamecode gets substituted as expected, and it executes codemvn verify B Dsonar.branchdevelop Dignorevardevelopcodep  pWhy is that Is this a bug or a featurep  pSo, how to achieve this correctly that is, I need a bamboo plan variable codebranchNamecode with a default value of codebamboo.repository.branch.namecode, which can be overridden by branch plans.p  pps I am aware that bamboo is a bad choice, and we are eventually moving to jenkins. however we still need to use bamboo for a while.p
Negative 691 pI have a custom phpsql application that tracks inquires by day and displays the daily total for the past 31 days.p  pFor some reason, the codeORDER BY date DESCcode will not pull anything after Feb 28th.  Yes the date column is in the correct MySQL date type format. All inserted entries have the correct date, so I know its not the data within the table.p  pHere is my queryp  precodeSELECT date, dateformatdate, W, M e AS day, COUNTday AS daycount  FROM inquiries  GROUP BY day  ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 31 codepre  pI cant seem to figure out why the descending order shows that Feb 28th is the most recent day, when in fact it is March 3rd. If I go into phpmyadmin and order by the date column desc, it sorts exactly like expected with March 3rd at the top. Anyone have an idea Thanks in advance.p

However angular does not respect that I can understand why and hence I need to get rid of it because on page load I need to get the first date in the list and load another piece of data with it dynamicallyp  pHow would I approach solving this Do note I am fairly new to Angular and this is a personal exercise to get a more cleaner solution.p
Negative 691 pIs there any way Django provides us to Encrypt all  atleast fields like firstname, lastname, emailid of auth.User model just like how it does encrypts PASSWORD field before storing it into Database p  hr  pMy Workaroundp  pI have gone through documentation amp few questions on StackOverflow, according to which it would be possible to inherit default BaseUser model amp define our own myUser model the way we want, by defining the Custom Character Field which encrypts amp decrypts characters.p  pProblem with this is in my application, I have provided SEARCH option for easy access of fields which are characters. If I encrypt all such Char Fields, its difficult for me to query for search option.p  pFor example If ABCD, ABCDE, ABC are strings in database amp user wishes to know all such entries which have BC, none of results pop out. Reason is each of ABCD, ABCDE, ABC encrypts to different  unique strings  I am using AES encryption provided by PyCrypto . Also BC gets encrypted to some unique string which has no similarity between that of ABCD, ABCDE, ABC  for obvious reason that I am using AES algorithm with key length as 32 . And the query I have written likep  precodeMyModel.objects.filterfirstnameicontainsBC codepre  pwould not return any result.  Yes I want search to be not case sensitive .p  p[Note I have added all required methods like topython , getdbprepvalue in Custom Field, also tried lookup method. But yeah actual problem is each string gets encrypted to unique characters in AES of same length]p  pSince I am new to Django, my question may not be that like a Django developer. I would like to know answer for either of above two questions. Unless I get answer I am deadlocked. Thanks in advance, but please be kind to me amp answer.p

Negative 691 pI have some idea of what I want to do, but Im not sure how to go about it best using Angular and Breeze, combined through the HotTowel template.  Our internal web app talks to an internal web service on another host, so we run into some crossdomain problems CORS.  To resolve this, Ive in a previous project used a simple serverside proxy to bounce the requests.  To do this, though, I need to attach the proxy URL to any outbound data requests.  So if breeze is ultimately looking for codehttpexampleservicehost.exampleodataEntitycode I want to change that to codehttpexamplesite.exampleproxy.ashxurlltencodedURLgtcodep  pBut Im not sure how to go about this. HotTowel replaces the Breeze ajax service with Angulars codehttpcode.  So I should be able to inject an http wrapper into there or modify where Angular gets http from to put the wrapper in even deeper.  p  pThe documentation for both is just leading me to suspect that any loose wrapper will encounter issues as it wont be a perfect fake for the real thing.  Any guidance on doing this or suggestions on where I can inject a wrapper  Alternatively, am I doing the serverside proxy the hard way and theres a better way to handle thatp

Negative 691 pIm trying to create a UnitTest for a class using JUnit and Mocktio.

Negative 691 pI have this PHP snippet that I call through curl, in order to perform an ffmpeg encoding. I also have another line afterwards that marks this as having been done, using a database.

Negative 691 pSo I have a UIPageviewController used that contains various news articles. The articles are presented on UIWebviews of varying lengths, and each UIWebview is contained within a UIScrollview. When the first article is loaded, everything works, and the user is able to scroll up and down the page and read the entire article. However, when the user swipes to the left or right to view the next article, the UIScrollview on that page is resized to only be the height of the screen and thus will only scroll enought to bounce back. I can tell that the UIWebview is longer than what is being shown because I have printed its height, and when scrolling, you can see that the article continues. Also, when you swipe back to the initial article View, this UIScrollview is also resized to only be the screen size. p  pThe UIWebView has its contents loaded in the ArticleViewControllers init method, and then is sized within the webViewDidLoad method like thisp  precodeCGRect frame  aWebView.frame frame.size.height  1 aWebView.frame  frame CGSize fittingSize  [aWebView sizeThatFitsCGSizeZero] frame.size  fittingSize aWebView.frame  frame codepre  pThis seems to work, although tell me if you think I should change it.p  pTo get to each article, you click on it from a UITableview presenting each of the articles. Within the DidSelectRowAtIndexPath method for this, I set up the UIPageViewController like sop  precodeUIPageViewController articlesPageViewController  [[UIPageViewController alloc] initWithTransitionStyleUIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScroll navigationOrientationUIPageViewControllerNavigationOrientationHorizontal optionsnil] articlesPageViewController.dataSource  self articlesPageViewController.delegate  self codepre  pstrongNVM The Solution was turning off auto layout for the UIScrollview Thanks everyonestrongp

Negative 691 pIm kind of crawling URLs, many of them identifying the content using query strings, e.g., YouTube videos. Often only a small subset of keys used in the query string are used to identify the content, sometimes the whole query string is not important at all. For example, in most YouTube URLs, query string key codevcode specifies the video, while codehdcode, if present and set to 1, plays the same video in HD.p  pI now like to find out which of the key in the query string are indeed important for the content. For this, I currently compare the page corresponding to a original URL e.g., codehttpwww.youtube.comwatchvkA0pkemJxMcamphd1code to the pages I receive if I remove each individual query string key step by step codehttpwww.youtube.comwatchvkA0pkemJxMccode and codehttpwww.youtube.comwatchhd1code. If the pages are the same, I argue that the key was not important.p  pWith that the question is, when are two pages the same For the time being I test two things a If the title of the pages differ, I assume the pages differ. Its often good enough, but I already stumbled over various websites that always use the same generic title. b I extract the visible text for both pages and calculate the topk most frequent words. If these two sets differ, I assume the pages differ. Works also not that bad, but many pages contain dynamic content e.g., latest tweets of Facebook messages in a sidebar DIV or something, thus effecting the set of most frequent words.p  pI guess that theres no 100 foolproof way to determine the important, i.e., contentdefining maybe this is even open for interpretation, query string keys. However, I wonder how I could improve my mechanism.p

I have my card reader installed, my card inserted, as I see it I am using WindowsMY key store..so i can call out certificates on the card from that key store as long as the card is inserted. When I check the certs via internet explorer I can see my certs that I got for free from internet and the ones that are on the card. I cant export the ones from the smart card with a private key, I know that is the whole point of the smart card so the process would be done externally.p  pMy problem lies in that that with the code I wrote I get the document signed with a cert that I have already made and not with the ones from the card, how do I sign it with a cert from the card, one more thing is that I am never asked for my smart card PIN number.p  pCan anyone help me out, I am trying really hard to tackle this digital signature thing, I know that the next thing is doing it with PKCS11 and dll file but I am not there yet.Thanksp  paddedp  pThanks for the answer Robert. You were right. I enumerated the alises in WINDOWSMY keystore and I did in fact sign the document with the first alias that was listed and it was my nonsmartcard certkey pair. Obviously that is not what i want to do, how would I go about signing it with different certkey, in my case with one that belongs to a smart card. Thanks againp

Negative 691 pI am running a multiprocess app which always crashes at a function, but i could see the stack of that function has been corrupted, it is getting corrupted just when it returns from a function call inside that function. But when i tried to print where the parent functions stack getting changed inside the called function it does not change anywhere inside the called function but it changes immediately after it returns from the called function. Any idea why the stack getting corrupted only when it returns from the function . Since i am running on a target mips box i tried to see who is writing to that stack using the address break point via gbdserver. But there is some problem with gdbserver it does not track the child process which is what i am interested in. Any idea how we can catch who is corrupting the stack in any other way p

We wont be saving, updating, or adding new ones.p  pOK, now lets say I have a JSON representation of an Item that looks like thisp  precodecategory id 1, name somename, description somedescription, id 101, createdat dateinfo codepre  pI would like create and save the Item object, but do not want to create a new category object. If I do thisp  precodeserializer  ItemSerializerdatadata if serializer.isvalid      serializer.save codepre  pIt complains that I am violating the uniqueTrue constraint on the categorys name field.

Negative 691 pI have a MVVM trading application.p  pcodeMainViewcode has two tab controls  left one displays a collection of codeworkspacescode and the right one displays dynamic data display charts.p  pWhen I create the first codechartviewmodelcode the correct chart appears in the right tab control as expected. When I then create another codechartviewmodelcode with different data that should result in a different chart, thats not what happens.  The second tab item is a duplicate of the first from a visual standpoint.  The tab items are contained in a collection of items called codechartspacescode and in debug mode I can see each viewmodel and indeed each has different values.p  pAlso, in debug mode I put a breakpoint on the codeInitializecode method of the view and when the first codechartviewmodelcode is created, that method indeed gets called.  When I then create the second codechartviewmodelcode, the codeInitializecode method is not called, so in fact another view is not getting created...but I cant figure out why.p  pMy viewviewmodels are tied together via codeDataTemplatecode with codexSharedFalsecode tried it with and without this parameter.  Ive traced through the constructor of the codechartviewmodelcode to ensure it was not getting any errors and it is not.p  pOn the leftmost tab control, I can create multiple codetradeviewmodelcode and each results in a different view... in other words it is behaving as expected.p  pMy XAML for the right tab control is essentially the same as for the left one with the exception of the codeworkspacecode collection left uses codeworkspacescode right uses codechartspacescode so Im at a loss as to what might be wrong or how to diagnose this problem further.p  pThe datatemplate looks likep  precode    ltDataTemplate xSharedFalse  DataTypexType vmModelOptionChainViewModelgt     ltvwDDDRiskChart gt ltDataTemplategt  codepre  pIn further experimenting, I put the tab items on the left side instead and found the same problem, but if I selected a nonDynamic Data Display tab item, then one of the DDD charts, they display correctly.  So, before I selected a DDD chart I had to display a nonDDD chart, then the DDD chart for it to display.p  pSo, moving the tab items back to the right tab control, I put the two DDD charts in, then put in a nonDDD chart a DataVisualization chart.  I found the same behavior...if I selected the nonDDD chart and then the DDD chart, it displays correctly.  If I just alternate between the two DDD charts, they will both display the same graph  Is that not weirdp

Negative 691 pI am developing an application that would employ a serverside phone number validation for the various countries it is deployed in. As an example, the UK mobile numbers all contain 11 digits starting with 07. In another country the mobile numbers may contain a different number of digits or may start with a different code. I would like to use such countryspecific phone number specification to validate the input of a web form. Please, note that the application will be deployed separately for each country. So for the UK version of the application a number starting with 099 or containing just 10 digits shall raise a submission error e.g. Invalid mobile phone number whereas, say, the German version of the application shall not raise an error at all. p  pWhat is the most elegant way to implement such localespecific form validation I had a look at the i18n gem but I am not sure it would easily support it.p

Negative 691 pIm trying to achieve dragging of view and when the drag stops, the view slide to top and disappear. I can use UIPanGestureRecognizer to drag the view fine.

Negative 691 pIve a Three.js web application using models, meshes, textures... A classic approach.p  pTo ensure that devices with weak hardware configuration can still use my app, I want to develop a 2D mode. Ive done this successfully, but the problem appears when I want to switch between 2D and 3D.p  pTechnically, the 3D mode uses the standard codeWebGL canvascode provided by Three.js, and the 2D mode uses a simple HTML codetablecode. Both codecanvascode and codetablecode are children of the same codedivcode.p  pTo switch between 2D and 3D, I change the CSS codedisplaycode property of the canvas or the table to codeblockcode or codenonecode according to the display mode I need to show on screen. The problem is this method doesnt ensure performance. Sometimes, the DOM is crashing and for example, the codecanvascode or the codetablecode disappear.p  pWhat is the best way to handle this kind of behavior  Maybe Three.js has builtin functions to reach this goal  Please let me know.p

Negative 691 pI have a emberdata model which has a codebelongsTocode relationship and Id like test whether there is any value aka, foreign key reference in this relationship. I initially thought I could just statep  precodeifmyModel.rel  null       do something now that belongsTo relationship has a value  codepre  pBut of course this doesnt work because codemyModel.relcode would never be null and instead is some sort of Ember Data object.

Negative 691 pI have a large amount of data approx 30million, packed into files of about 20K records, which I want to load into a postgresql db through a Java program. Any of these records might be broken or cause a constraint violation less than 1, quite negligible, which in that case I would like to simply discard the record and continue. p  pI have been trying to use COPY command for the speed, but the problem is that COPY discards the content of the file as soon as it finds an exception in itp  pThen I tried to use a prepared statement with manualcommit connection, where I commit at the end of each file, but again, if I get a broken record at say location 10k, all the previous records are discarded againp  pI cant use autocommit connection, because of performance issues it will have.p  pAny idea how I can get this donep  pThanksp

Negative 691 pso I found myself adding a TinyMCE plugin, and after a while, I have ended up with 3 different ones in WordPress. Figured the best way to add would be to write a universal wrapper function, since all the plugins differ only in names, and some other bits. p  pEnded up with a function like sop  precodefunction var plugin1  new TinyMCE.addPlugin     tinymce.majorVersion  .  tinymce.minorVersion,     Modal.php,              height 250        codepre  pI have 3 plugins like this that use an internal big function wrapper, that does the same for all. but the problem occurs with TinyMCE events.p  pFor example, this function is in the global big wrapper function, it looks like thisp  precodeed.onclick, functione      remove elements      add element here  codepre  pUpon clicking on element in TinyMCE, I remove all elements with some class, and a new alement with that class. Of course this stops working in a real live example with multiple plugins. Lets say 3, or 4. Upon clicking, the plugin decides yes, this is my turn, and deletes all elements with a class, and adds a new one.p  pBut the other instances of the same funciton determine to remove those  since theree is a call to remove all with the same class. p  pHow would you avoid that What identifier  bahaviour needs to be put in, to avoid thisp  pThanksp

Negative 691 pIn a recent project I have the need to test a Java class that makes use of a specific Git repository.

Furthermore the actual repository isnt small and it would take at least 10 minutes to clone it.p  pSo far I wasnt able to find any way to emulate a repository with maybe 10  15 commits inside a JUnit test class so every suggestion is welcome.p  pOh yes, the repository would ideally also have multiple subrepositoriessubmodules, but I would also be happy with a solution that provides a single repo.p

Negative 691 pBased on numerous books and blogs including a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combpfxteamarchive2012041310293638.aspxthis excellent one herea, it is clear that when one writes a dll library exposing helper async methods i.e. the wrapper methods, it is generally considered a best practice to internally complete the IO task of actual async methods on a threadpool thread like so pseudo code shown below for brevity and Im using codeHttpClientcode as an examplep  precodepublic Async TaskltHttpResponseMessagegt MyMethodAsync..      ...     var httpClient  new HttpClient..     var response  await httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync...ConfigureAwaitfalse     ...     return response  codepre  pThe key here is the usage of codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode so that IO task completion occurs on a threadpool thread instead of on the original thread context, thereby potentially preventing deadlocks.p  pMy question is from the perspective of a caller. Im particularly interested in a scenario where there are layers of method calls between the caller and the above method call, as the following example shows.p  precodeCallerA gt Method1Async gt Method2Async gt finally the above MyMethodAsync codepre  pIs it enough to have codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode on the final method only or should one also ensure codeMethod1Asynccode and codeMethod2Asynccode also internally call their async methods with codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode It seems silly to have it included on all these intermediary methods, especially if codeMethod1Asynccode and codeMethod2Asynccode are simply overloads that end up calling codeMyMethodAsynccode. Any thoughts, please enlighten usp  pstrongUpdated with Examplestrong So if I have a library with the following private async method,p  precodeprivate async Taskltstringgt MyPrivateMethodAsyncMyClass myClass      ...     return await SomeObject.ReadAsStringAsync.ConfigureAwaitfalse  codepre  pshould I make sure the following public overloaded methods both also include ConfigureAwaitfalse as shown belowp  precodepublic async Taskltstringgt MyMethodAsyncstring from          return await MyPrivateMethodAsyncnew MyClass  From  from, To  someDefaultValue.ConfigureAwaitfalse  public async Taskltstringgt MyMethodAsyncstring from, string to          return await MyPrivateMethodAsyncnew MyClass  From  from, To  to .ConfigureAwaitfalse  codepre

Negative 691 pI have some legacy Java code which uses the V2 Google spreadsheet API to read values from one Google spreadsheet, retrieve some DB values amp do some calcs, and update a second Google spreadsheet.  With the imminent cutover to OAuth2 authentication only, I need to migrate to the V3 API with some urgency I know we have left this a bit late but reasons.p  pThis process gets run from the command line, so the assumption would be that using a service account and a P12 key would be the way forward  and indeed, we are doing that for using the Google calendar service.p  pBut it doesnt seem like there is support in place for the spreadsheet service for service accounts.  Ive seen older references 2 years ago to Google Data APIs supporting OAuth2 service accounts through the setOAuth2Credentials method, but that does not seem to be true today.p  pHas anyone had any luck in getting the V3 spreadsheet API working with an OAuth2 service account in Java, or can point me to emrecentem within the last year code samplesp

Negative 691 pi have a problem with including jQuery, i have always done it like this and it has worked, until now... Tell me what have i done wrong. I also suspect it might be because im not on my laptop, but i visited one site that i had made earlier and the jQuery there worked.

Negative 691 pFor a custom user control in MS Dynamics CRMstyle, I need to have a combobox, which is not natively present in HTML.p  pMy idea was to put an codeinputcode and a codeselectcode after each other. The Problem is that I can p  ul lipuse the codeselectcode controls arrow itself, but then I need to get rid of the value part of the codeselectcode control. It is at least present when I mark via moving the mouse with button down, even with codecolortransparentcode, or pli liplay another element on top, but then I cannot open the dropdown programmatically.pli ul  pThe control must as well stretch along the codeinputcode element to full size of the whole control.p  pAlso, in the Internet Explorer, the dropdown list also moves with the currently selected element, so if I select, say, the third codeoptioncode, when opening next time, the first two codeoptioncodes will be displayed above.p  pSince this custom control will be displayed in an codeiframecode, I have to use a codeselectcode so that the dropdownpart will be rendered outside the codeiframecode as well and does not get cut off. This is required.p  pPlease see a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netz7tcrtdg relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.netz7tcrtdga to get a rough idea.p
Negative 691 pIm a Hadoop newbie, and Ive been trying to get a mapreduce job to work. The problem that Im currently facing is that more map tasks than I want are running simultaneously. Ill get on to the reason why I want to limit the number of running tasks in due course. Even though mapreduce.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum is 2, in the examples Ive tried so far strongallstrong of the mapper tasks are running simultaneously.p  pIm starting to get the impression that the reason for this is that setting the maximum number of map tasks, or the maximum number of running tasks per job, has no effect because that is based around the idea of a node having a fixed number of slots for task execution, and that this isnt how mapreduce works any more. Instead, the number of tasks allowed to run is worked out dynamically on the basis of how much memory and CPU tasks are using. So, if tasks arent memory or CPU hungry which mine currently arent then lots of them are allowed to run simultaneously.p  p[If what Ive just said is wrong, please feel free to correct me.]p  pThe problem for me is that whilst one of my map tasks is running it is consuming a licence for a thing that Im integrating with, and there is a limited number of licences per node. Hence, I want to limit the number of running map tasks on any one node.p  pSo my question is is there a solution to this Perhaps theres some existing configuration parameter that Ive overlooked, and that does what I want. Or maybe Ill need to write a scheduler class that does what I want, and configure my jobs to use that.p  pWith regard to the latter suggestion, I dont even know whether the relevant scheduler here is the one controlled by mapreduce.jobtracker.taskscheduler or by yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.class. Moreover, is this the sort of thing that can be configured on a perjob basis, or does if have to be done globally.p  pIm using Cloudera CDH 5.4.2, although I could switch my experimenting over to a different distribution if that would make things easier.p

Negative 691 pIm developing an android kindofgalleryapp with Firebase, so I will have plenty of images. I know that I need to be careful about memory management. p  pWhen I was searching how to find memory leak in android apps, I came across with a hrefhttpsgithub.comsquareleakcanary relnofollowLeakCanarya. It looks really great, so I used in my app. p  pBasically my app has 3 fragments, which are Drawer, ProductGrid and ProductDetail. Sometimes LeakCanary says that I have a memory leak in ProductGrid, but I couldnt find it Usually, adapters or static methods or listeners could cause memory leak because of Context object, but my knowledge is not sufficient to say aah thats because of here p  pHere are the classes. Where is the leakIf you suggest me anything that I can improve my code or approach, I would be appreciatedp  pBecause of body character limit, I put the a hrefhttpademilhan.comlog.txt relnofollowlinka leak canary log file.p  pstrongHow I suspect there is a memory leakstrongp  pFirst of all, LeakCanary shows a dialog and logs the dump. Second thing is, when I click on an item in drawer, in grid and in detail like 15 timesrespectively, memory usage increases. It starts with 18M, increases 22M23M after showing 3 imagesnormal. Then it heads up to 29M30M after clicking on 15 times. If you click on around 3040, memory usage increases 34M35Mp  pstrongEditstrong Ive just figured out that, if I open and close drawer, memory usage increases 0.05M everytime, so one time opening and

Negative 691 pIm working on a tool to automatically update our typed datasets when our xsd schema files change. Ive noticed that when I add an xsd file to Visual Studio and open it up in the design view, if I change a property and save there are substantial changes to the xsd file. Basically a lot of annotations are added to each element. For examplep  precodeltxselement nameEventWeathergt codepre  pbecomes the followingp  precodeltxselement nameEventWeather mspropGeneratorTableClassNameEventWeatherDataTable mspropGeneratorTableVarNametableEventWeather mspropGeneratorRowChangedNameEventWeatherRowChanged mspropGeneratorTablePropNameEventWeather mspropGeneratorRowDeletingNameEventWeatherRowDeleting mspropGeneratorRowChangingNameEventWeatherRowChanging mspropGeneratorRowEvHandlerNameEventWeatherRowChangeEventHandler mspropGeneratorRowDeletedNameEventWeatherRowDeleted mspropGeneratorRowClassNameEventWeatherRow mspropGeneratorUserTableNameEventWeather mspropGeneratorRowEvArgNameEventWeatherRowChangeEventgt codepre  pThe problem is that if these annotations are not added to the xsd file, the resulting typed dataset code generated by xsd.exe does not compile and gives me an error saying that the dataset already contains a definition for one of the generated types. I would like to be able to automatically add these annotations to the xsd file without having to open it in Visual Studio but have not been able to find any information about that. p  pDoes anyone know how I can leverage this xsd updating functionality from visual studio using the command line My xsd files are very large so adding these by hand is not an option.p

Negative 691 pIm using the standard Flyway Gradle plugin from Flyway 3.2.1p  pFlyway doesnt seem to output any SQL logging, at least not at debug level.p  pIve configured p6spy and I can now see the SQL that Flyway is issuing, but only by enabling Gradle debug output with the d switch.  But when Gradle is invoked with the d switch, it outputs emfarem too much noise.  This is my fallback position for now, but its not very nice.p  pUltimately, all I want to do is get the DDL that Flyway is issuing when I run the flywayMigrate output to the build log on our CI server  but I cant figure out any way to do it other than the p6spy  enable all debug output method outlined above.p  pIm Ok with using p6spy, but I cant figure out how to configure Gradle logging for just the p6spy logger.  Even just enabling all Gradle debug logging for only the flyway migrate task would also probably be Ok  its all the Gradle bookkeeping dependencies and whatnot thats gumming up the logs. p  pSo thats the question how can I cut down on all this debug logging so I can see just the DDL that flyway is issuing.p

Negative 691 pI am trying to create an event handler for a TreeNode AfterCheck event. I want to check all children when the parent is checked. The only issue is that I am not sure how to do this when the TreeView is created at runtime. This code assumes that I have a TreeView named treeView1 already on the form.

Negative 691 pWorking with an AngularJS app 1.4.3, I want a controller to make a call to a method on a service, which should return a boolean value. p  pUnder the hood, the service used to make a call to window.confirm, and then just return the result. I am trying to switch the implementation to use Angular Materials a hrefhttpsmaterial.angularjs.orglatestapimaterial.components.dialogservicemdDialog relnofollowmdDialoga.confirm API, but this returns a promise.p  pThe problem I am running into is that there is no way to return true or false directly from my service without changing the code in my controller to expect a promise. The whole purpose of extracting this method into a service was so that the controller could be separated from the implementation details of the call, and I would consider using a promise ie, a future boolean vs. a straight boolean to be an implementation detail.p  pHere is some code to illustrate In the controllerp  precodefunction confirmDeleteDevice      if notificationService.confirmAre you sure you want to delete the device          deleteDevice       codepre  pOld function in notificationServicep  precodefunction confirmmessage      return window.confirmmessage  codepre  pNew function in notificationService that will not work as expected with the controller code abovep  precodefunction confirmmessage      var confirm  mdDialog.confirm         .titlemessage         .ariaLabelmessage         .okYes         .cancelNo     return mdDialog.showconfirm.thenfunction          return true     , function          return false       codepre  pWithout changing the controller code to rely on the implementation detail of using a promise, how do I get a boolean value out of my service method The code above will always execute deleteDevice because the new notificationService.confirm will return the unresolved promise, which apparently qualifies as a truthy value for the if clause.p  pIm definitely no expert on promises, and I understand this isnt exactly how they are expected to be used, but Id really rather not tie the controller down to using a promise. Is this even possible given the async nature of promisesp  pUPDATE I definitely looked before I posted and could find nothing, but a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30026041usepromiseswithinservicebutnotreturningapromiserq1this just showed upa in the related questions feed, so I see now my question was a duplicate. The answers there are pretty helpful.p

Negative 691 pI am new to celery, i have an celeryserver, like the code below which returns results after some time, depending on calculation. I have emulated this behaviour in this simple program below with the sleep function. What i want is to process the early returning results before the heavy results.

Therefore i want to process the returning results based on the order they arrive at the client. Right now see client code it waits until the heavy tasks has returned.p  pBut with the examples from celery docs, i am supposed to wait for results by checking the id, or poll for them which is dumb, because  celery client has to check the id of the first arrived result somehow i guess. p  pHow can I process the results of celery in the order they arrive at the client I dont want to poll in an endless loop for result.ready  as this completely screws up IMHO somehow the sense of aync processing. p  pFound no solution in the docs.

Negative 691 pIm really struggling with this. I want to display a bubble chart with highcharts, im calling the data via Ajax and its being sent in a JSON.
