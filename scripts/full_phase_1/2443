Positive 2443 pFYI This will be my first real foray into AsyncAwait for too long Ive been settling for the familiar territory of BackgroundWorker. Its time to move on.p  pI wish to build a WCF service, selfhosted in a Windows service running on a remote machine in the same LAN, that does thisp  ol liAccepts a request for a single .ZIP archiveli liCreates the archive and packages several filesli liReturns the archive as its response to the requestli ol  pI have to support archives as large as 10GB. Needless to say, this scenario isnt covered by basic WCF designs we must take additional steps to meet the requirement. We must eliminate timeouts while the archive is building and memory errors while its being sent. Both of these occur under basic WCF designs, depending on the size of the file returned.p  pMy plan is to proceed using a hrefhttpwww.codeguru.comimagesvrce1145AsyncWCFServicesimage001.jpg relnofollowtaskbased asynchronous WCF callsa and a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles166763WCFStreamingUploadDownloadFilesOverHTTP relnofollowstreaming modea.p  pI have two concernsp  ol liIs this the proper approach to the problemli liMicrosoft has done a nice job at abstracting all of this, but what of the underlying protocols What goes on under the hood Does the server keep the connection alive while the archive is building could be several minutes or instead does it close the connection and initiate a new one once the operation is complete, thereby requiring me to properly route the request through the client machine firewallli ol  pFor 2, clearly Im hoping for the former keepalive. But after some searching Im not easily finding an answer. Perhaps you know.p

If a swipe is recorded, no buttons are pressed and a new swipe is made within 5 seconds, the previous swipe is files with an indeterminate direction and the new swipe options are displayed.p  pAll of this seems to be working apart from the reset of the screen after the 5 second timeout.

Positive 2443 pstrongTLDRstrongp  pNontrivial memory leak, can be seen easily in Resharper. See minimal example below.p  hr  pIm seeing a memory leak in the following program but failing to see why. p  pThe program sends pings to a number of hosts asynchronously and determines if at least one is ok. To do that, a method codeSendPingcode that runs these async operations is repeatedly called which runs them in a background thread it doesnt have to, but in the actual application codeSendPingcode will be called by the main UI thread which shouldnt be blocked. p  pThe task seems pretty trivial but I think the leak occurs due to the way I create lambdas inside the codeSendPingcode method. The program can be changed to not use lambdas but Im more interested in understanding what causes the leak here.p  precodepublic class Program       static string[] hosts   www.google.com, www.facebook.com       static void SendPing              int numSucceeded  0         ManualResetEvent alldone  new ManualResetEventfalse          ManualResetEvent[] handles  new ManualResetEvent[hosts.Length]         for int i  0 i lt hosts.Length i             handles[i]  new ManualResetEventfalse          BackgroundWorker worker  new BackgroundWorker         worker.DoWork  sender, args gt                      numSucceeded  0             Actionltint, boolgt onComplete  hostIdx, succeeded gt                              if succeeded Interlocked.Incrementref numSucceeded                 handles[hostIdx].Set                           for int i  0 i lt hosts.Length i                 SendPingi, onComplete              ManualResetEvent.WaitAllhandles                   worker.RunWorkerCompleted  sender, args gt                      Console.WriteLineSucceeded   numSucceeded             BackgroundWorker bgw  sender as BackgroundWorker             alldone.Set                   worker.RunWorkerAsync         alldone.WaitOne         worker.Dispose           static void SendPingint hostIdx, Actionltint, boolgt onComplete              Ping pingSender  new Ping         pingSender.PingCompleted  sender, args gt                      bool succeeded  args.Error  null ampamp args.Cancelled ampamp args.Reply  null ampamp args.Reply.Status  IPStatus.Success             onCompletehostIdx, succeeded             Ping p  sender as Ping             p.Dispose                   string data  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa         byte[] buffer  Encoding.ASCII.GetBytesdata         PingOptions options  new PingOptions64, true         pingSender.SendAsynchosts[hostIdx], 2000, buffer, options, hostIdx           private static void Mainstring[] args              for int i  0 i lt 1000 i                      Console.WriteLineSend ping   i             SendPing                codepre  pResharper shows the leaks are due to uncollected closure objects codecDisplayClass...code. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comHhBJt.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHhBJt.png altenter image description herea a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comki1T5.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comki1T5.png altenter image description hereap  pFrom what I understand, there shouldnt be a leak because there are no circular references as far as I see and therefore GC should take of the leaks.

Positive 2443 pI have a main activity in which i have used a view pager.So i can move between 4 tabs and the view pager handles all of that.One of my tabs scans the contacts on the phone to get their details and display it in the recylerview which is in the same tab,this task takes a long time and i am doing this in an async task.Everything is working fine but the problem is if i move to another tab while this scanning is going on the data does not get applied to the recycler view possible because that fragment is being destroyed. Is there a workaround for this or should i just prevent the user from shifting tabs while the scanning is going on if so some sort of code or a link to the code would be really helpfull.p

Positive 2443 pI have a C desktop application, which needs to make multiple simultaneous http requests to the same web server. Heres the test I performed to check whether my requests actually do happen simultaneouslyp  ol lipOn the web server, created a test page that sleeps for 3 seconds simulates some longrunning task, then returns current datetime. Heres the code VB.Netp  pltsystem.threading.thread.sleep3000ltnow pli lipIn the C app, I have a function MakeRequest which uses System.Net.Http.HttpClient to make a web request, and returns the response as string.pli lipThen in the C app theres a function invoked by a button click, that calls MakeRequest multiple times asynchronouslyp  pvar responses  await Task.WhenAllMakeRequest, MakeRequest, MakeRequest pli ol  pIn the above example, MakeRequest is called 3 times. What I see on the web server when I monitor the Requestssec performance counter, is that it gets 2 requests, and then 3 sec later 1 more request. Thats by design, because the default value for System.Net.ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit is 2, so my C app can only send 2 requests at a time, though I asked for 3. Overall time the C app took to complete the button click was 6 sec.p  pNow in the C app, I set ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit  1000000. This time Requestssec on the web server shows 3, and the button click in the C app completes in 3 seconds. All good so far.p  pNext I change the C app to make 60 simultaneous calls rather than 3. Thats where things get interesting. When I click the button, I expect to see Requestssec on the web server to spike to 60, and the C app to complete the button click in 3 sec. What I get instead is web server Requestssec showing something like 5, after 3 seconds 5 more, etc., until all 60 requests have been made. When I click the button again, the same picture except for Requestssec spike to 10 or 15, and the button click obviously completes faster. Click again  this time Requestssec show two spikes to 30, and the button click completes in 6 sec. Subsequent button clicks result in the Requestssec spiking first to 40 then to 20 for the total of 60 requests, then 50 and 10, then maybe 55 and 5, and eventually my C app starts sending all 60 requests in one go. The button click completes in 3 sec, and Requestssec on the web server shows one spike to 60. If I continue pushing the button, I consistently get all 60 requests being made simultaneously.p  pBut thats not all. If I stop pushing the button, my C app seems to forget its previous achievement. I do not restart the app, just stop pushing the button for a minute, and on the next push I go back to 5 requests at a time, and the above scenario would repeat if I keep pushing the button continuously.p  pI also performed the above test from MVC  just copied and pasted the code from the C app to a MVC page. Got exactly the same result.p  pCan anyone please explain whats going on Thank youp

Positive 2443 pIm working on a series of methods that execute many different database calls using entity framework. Many of these methods can run asynchronously as I really dont care about their output, and dont rely on them.p  pHowever, when I try implementing certain methods, I get a warning from the compiler saying Because this call is not awaited, the current method continues to run before the call is completedp  pBut to me, this seems like thats my desired behavior, as I dont care what the methods do.p  pHeres an example of the methodsp  precodepublic async Task SetupAccessControlint objectTypeId, int objectId, int organizationId      using var context  new SupportContextCustomerId              ...  omitted for brevity         if objectTypeId  int ObjectType.User                      AddToUserRoleBridgeEveryone, objectIdWarning on this line             AddToUserRoleBridgeDefault, objectId Warning on this line                  ...  omitted for brevity        public async Task AddToUserRoleBridgestring role, int userId      using var context  new SupportContextCustomerId              var defaultRole  context.Roles.FirstOrDefaultn gt n.Name  role         if defaultRole  null                      var urb  new UserRoleBridge                              RoleId  defaultRole.Id,                 UserId  userId                           context.UserRoleBridges.Addurb             await context.SaveChangesAsync                 codepre  pstrongeditstrongp  pEssentially, when I run the main function, I want a series of method calls to all fire off somewhat simultaneously and handle everything in their own threads so that I dont have to worry about it.

Negative 2443 pI am currently trying to use NAnt and CruiseControl.NET to manage various aspects of my software development. Currently, NAnt handles just about everything, including replacing environment specific settings eme.g., database connection stringsem based on an input target that I specify on the command line.p  pCruiseControl.NET is used to build the application for the default environment emdevem anytime new code is committed. I also want CruiseControl.NET to invoke a build for my additional environments test and stage, but I do not want these to be automatically invoked every time that a dev build invoked daily as test and stage deployments happen far less frequently. Test and stage deployments only occur when the application is ready for QA.p  pI can easily do this by specifying multiple projects, one for each environment. However, I already have many projects configured, one for each milestone in within my application. If I have to setup 3 projects for each milestone the CruiseControl.NET configuration can get out of hand quickly.p  pstrongHere is my questionstrong Can I parameterize a CruiseControl.NET project configuration such that the parameters are exposed by the web interfacep  pemPreferably I think, I could have checkboxes for each environment e.g., dev, test, stage exposed in the web interface. A build would be made for each environment that is checked, whether the build was forced or automatic. It would be even better if I could default the checked state.emp

Negative 2443 pProblem I have a method that compiles to over 8000 bytes of Java bytecode. HotSpot has a magic limit that makes the JIT not kick in for methods that exceed 8000 bytes. Yes, it is reasonable to have a huge method. This is a tokenizer loop. The method is in a library and I dont want to require users of the library to have to configure HotSpot to deactivate the magic limit.p  pObservation Decompiling the bytecode shows that Eclipse Java Compiler generates a lot of pointless gotos. javac is even worse. That is, there are gotos that are only reachable from jumps. Obviously, the jump that jumps to the goto should instead jump directly where the goto jumps and the goto should be eliminated.p  pQuestion Is there a bytecode optimizer for Java 5 class files that flattens pointless jump chains and then removes unnecessary gotosp  pEdit I mean patterns likep  precode8698   goto8548 8701   goto0 codepre  pObviously, the second goto can only be reached by a jump to 8701 which might as well be a direct jump to 0.p  pOn a second investigation, this questionable pattern is more commonp  precode4257   ificmpne4263 4260   goto8704 4263   aload0 codepre  pWhere obviously, one would like the compiler to reverse the not equal comparison to equal comparison, jump to 8704 and eliminate the goto.p

I am using JFugue framework to generate music strings from what was played, and then it can be easily exported to midi. In order to generate these strings I will have to measure how much the tone was pressed and then give it some musical note length. This information about note length is also appended to the string. If you think I dont even need this please let me know, because I am Java beginner. p

Negative 2443 pThis is yet another Unit Testing question.  Im trying to draw knowledge from a number of places regarding how to proceed, and I wanted to bounce my current understanding off of the collection of experts here.p  passume a project for which all dependencies except opengl funkiness are statically linked except the c run timep  pMy current understandings so farp  ol lipIt is ok to make unit tests that only test the public interface of classes because ultimately the class is the unit that is most sane to test.  Problems can be hunted down from there inside the offending class, and a class that is too complicated to debug, requiring unit testing of its internal structures, is a good candidate for having it broken up. This practice makes it possible to write unit tests in its own project, from a Visual studio perspective.pli lipA code coverage tool, like CoverageMeter, is installed in the main project, and given its own build configuration, like test instead of debug.  This will place the metrics inside the object code for the external viewer tool to get metrics.pli lipAt the same time, the main application is built as a library in the Test configuration, so that the external Unit Test project uses the object code to run its tests.  At the same time further, the CoverageMeter code is included in the library that the Unit Test project uses for its run, making the coverage metrics measure how much code is being exercised in unit tests.pli lipWith a testing configuration made separate from release or debug, placeholder libraries can be used to break dependencies like opengl.pli ol  pMy questions really are Is this pie in the sky stuff Do I have my understandings right can I actually do the first sentence of 3, is that how I would get the Unit test code to run the object code build in the main app project, or is there another wayp  pAm I insane I am open to any criticism. Thanks in advance for your time.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong So it looks like I have the right idea of what to exercise in my unit tests, but Im concerned about 3.

Many names in this position indicate special alignment or indentation rules these are special operators, macros, or procedures that have certain parameter structures.p  pIf the first subform is a nonspecial name, however, then if the second subform is on the same line, align the starting column of all following subforms with that of the second subform.

Negative 2443 pI have an internal API that I would like others to reference in their projects as a compiled DLL. When its a standalone project thats referenced, I use conditional compilation if statements to switch behavior of a key web service class depending on compilation symbols. The problem is, once an assembly is generated, it appears that its locked into whatever the compilation symbols were when it was originally compiled  for instance, if this assembly is compiled with DEBUG and is referenced by another project, even if the other project is built as RELEASE, the assembly still acts as if it was in DEBUG as it doesnt need recompilation. That makes sense, just giving some background.p  pNow Im trying to work around that so I can switch the assemblys behavior by some other means, such as scanning the appweb config file for a switch. The problem is, some of the assemblys code I was switching between are attributes on methods, for examplep  precodeif PRODUCTION         [SoapDocumentMethodAttributehttpsprodServerServiceTest, RequestNamespace  httpsprodServer, ResponseNamespace  httpsprodServer] else         [SoapDocumentMethodAttributehttpsdevServerServiceTest, RequestNamespace  httpsdevServer, ResponseNamespace  httpsdevServer] endif         public string ServiceTest                       test service          codepre  pThough there might be some syntactical sugar that allows me to flip between two attributes of the same type in another fashion, I dont know it. Any ideasp  pThe alternative method would be to reference the entire project instead of the assembly, but Id rather stick with just referencing the compiled DLL if I can. Im also completely open to a whole new approach to solve the problem if thats what it takes.p

Its pretty simple if Im asserting just bunch of Integers or Strings. It can also be pretty painful if Im trying to assert a collection of Hibernate domains, say for example. The collection.containsAll.. relies on the equals.. to perform the check, but I always override the equals.. in my Hibernate domains to check only the business keys which is the best practice stated in the Hibernate website and not all the fields of that domain. Sure, it makes sense to check just against the business keys, but there are times I really want to make sure all the fields are correct, not just the business keys for example, new data entry record. So, in this case, I cant mess around with the domain.equals.. and it almost seems like I need to implement some comparators for just unit testing purposes instead of relying on collection.containsAll...p  pAre there some testing libraries I could leverage here How do you test your collectionp  pThanks.p

Normally the server will present a list of trusted CA to the device trying to connect to it and the device will have to send a certificate that has been signed by any of the CAs the server has presented. But since our self signed CA certificate was not installed on the server, the browser could present a certificate that would be acceptable by the server.p  pSo we went on the install the CA cert on the server  control panel Hsphere.p  pWe took the content of the ca certificate and copied it in the Certificate Authority File textarea on the server and the server wouldnt accept it everytime complaining Failed to update SSL Config Different key and certificatep  pThe CA certificate has been signed by itself so how can the server say that the certificate and key are different.p  pWe also tried to copy the content of both the CA certificate file and the CA key file into the Certificate Authority File textarea, but that also wouldnt work.p  pAs i said we have been struggling with that for more than one month.

Negative 2443 pso  I have this Socket not XMLSocket, just Socket client. I also have a custom PHP script on my server, that listens on port X. My client tries to connect to it.p  pEverything works fine, the security and communication, sync and whatever else. But  the Flash Player AIR runtime actually shoots an error when trying to connect, but ONLY when the server is not running...

Also, the connect part is also in try catch IOError block...p  pWHY does Flash say the problem is on line 167 when it is obviously elsewhere And  or what can be the problemp

Oh... an exception has occurred. I cant actually handle it here, but I can add some additional information, and rethrow. Maybe another handler, higher up the call chain can handle it.p  pA case in point might be some sort of SQL error. I might not be able to handle the exception at the point of calling, but might wish to add some additional context information like I was calling this, and passing that.p  pIt seems like it might be useful to pass back up the call chain an exception of the type that was originally raised, as opposed to Exception or ApplicationException. I know I could create my own custom exception classes, but it seems that it adds nothing much when you already have a nice specific exception.p  pOf course, I might be wrong.

Negative 2443 p2 days of reading every posting i could get my hands on with no luck.  Here is what I am trying to do  p  pI have a standard split view controller that loads a new view controller on the Right for each item you choose on the Left.  Standard easy stuff.  Now the impossible part.  I have added a big button in the middle of each detail view controller.  I want to click the button and have it automatically advance to the next view simulating someone actually clicking the next item in the root view in the left.  p  pA bonus would be to actually have the left root view side also highlight the next row in the list when the button is hit.p  pId pay fifty bucks for working sample code not much I know.p  pThanks.p
Negative 2443 pI have a datamodel for Entity Framework in which some entities have a collection of attributes that can be used to add extra information.

Negative 2443 pWhat we are try to do seems simple enough, we want to show the popular products from each category within our menu. Were looking to get 5 of those products, since thats what the UI is designed to handle. We would like them sorted by popularity, which I believe is number of views on the product in Magento.p  pIt many cases, the menu category were requesting has no products for itself. So, it has to support pulling in products for its children as well. Example of one branch of our category layout isp  ul liMens, 2 no items ul liShirts, 5 has itemsli liAccessories, 6 has itemsli liPants, 7 has itemsli liEtc, 8 has itemsli ulli ul  pWhat this code currently does, is return the same popular products list regardless of the Category we pass it to filter. Removing the addCategoryFilter... effectively returns the same results. I suspect if we can solve how to filter by Categories the rest will fall into place.p  precodestoreId  1 category  Category Object for id  2 passed to this code productCount  5  products  MagegetResourceModelreportsproductcollection gtaddOrderedQty gtaddAttributeToSelect gtaddAttributeToSelectarrayname,smallimage gtsetStoreIdstoreId gtaddStoreFilterstoreId gtaddCategoryFiltercategory gtaddViewsCount gtsetPageSizeproductCount codepre  pWeve tried a few variations on this. Im not sure if the addCategoryFilter... method takes into account children categories or not. If not, that should be easy enough to query out and solve.

Negative 2443 pI am writing a simulation which requires a backing database to store the results. The simulation writes a huge amount of data.

First we create configuration maps to Simulation table and specify scenarios and how many Realization to calculate. Then we start the simulation. The simulation creates realizations in a scenario in parallel, so many realizations and calculated at the same time and inserted into the scenario the simulation is currently working on. p  pHowever, in NoSQL, specifically MongoDB, relations are bad and slow, so I should make use of embedded documents as much as possible. So I came up with thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZ4rpa.png altEmbedded data modelp  pThis model should give me the best performance when first calculating all realizations and THEN saving it to the database as a single insert of Scenario. p  pHowever, for performance reasons, I want to insert a Realization into Scenario as soon as it is computed.

Negative 2443 pI use TcpClient BeginConnect to create a socket connection to a TCP server.  That returns an IAsyncResult where CompletedSynchronously is false which is what I would expect at least most of the time.  I wrap the sockets NetworkStream in an SslStream call BeginAuthenticateAsClient which returns an IAsyncResult where CompletedSynchronously is true.  This really surprised me since this method makes multiple round trips to the server to do the handshake.  Every BeginWrite amp BeginRead I do from that point on returns an IAsyncResult where CompletedSynchronously is true.p  pI suspect that the implementation of SslStream does not support async IO.  I was going to confirm this by going to the server without the SSL wrapper but unfortunately that server requires SSL so I couldnt.p  pIf SslStream does not support async io I plan to wrap the SslStream around an in memory stream and then pass that along to NetworkStream BeginReadBeginWrite.

Negative 2443 pHeres the synopsis of our problem.  We sell several mobile applications and sell through our own websiteecommerce platform.  Most people originally hit our website from their PC and order through their mobile phone when their trials expire.

This makes it very hard for us to tracking a lot of key metrics on things like Google Analytics and Visual Website Optimizer.p  pBecause the user has to download our product by visiting a URL on their phone, we think we may be able to create a unique URL for every visitor and replicate that sessioncookie data.

Negative 2443 pI have two views of some data a list view a codeListBoxcode now, but Ive been meaning to switch to codeListViewcode and a fancy graphical representation on a map. In either view the user can click an object and it will be selected in both views. Multiselect is also possible, so each codeViewModelcode instance has its own codeIsSelectedcode property.p  pCurrently Im binding codeListBoxItem.IsSelectedcode to codeViewModel.IsSelectedcode, but this only works properly if the codeListBoxcode is NOT virtualizing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7097999wpfbindingtolistboxitemisselecteddoesntworkforoffscreenitemssee herea. Unfortunately, disabling virtualization hurts performance and my app has become too slow.p  pSo I have to enable virtualization again. In order to maintain the codeViewModel.IsSelectedcode property of offscreen items, I noticed that codeListBoxcode and codeListViewcode have a codeSelectionChangedcode event that I can presumably use to propagate the selection state from the codeListBoxListViewcode to the codeViewModelcode.p  pMy question is, how do I propagate selection state in the reverse direction The codeSelectedItemscode property of codeListBoxListViewcode is readonly Suppose the user clicks an item in the graphical representation, but it is offscreen w.r.t. the list. If I just set codeViewModel.IsSelectedcode then the codeListBoxListViewcode will be unaware of the new selection, and as a consequence it will fail to emdeselectem that item if the user clicks a different item in the list. I could call codeListBox.ScrollIntoViewcode from the codeViewModelcode, but there are a couple of problemsp  ul liIn my UI its actually possible to select two items with one click if they are in the same location graphically, although they may be located in completely different locations in the codeListBoxListViewcode.  li liIt breaks ViewModel isolation my ViewModel is totally unaware of WPF and Id like to keep it that way.li ul  pSo, my dear WPF experts, any thoughtsp  pEDIT I ended up switching to an Infragistics control and using an ugly and rather slow solution. The point is, I no longer need an answer.p

Negative 2443 pA designer recently handed me designs for a site Im building for a client. Theyre great designs but Im really scratching my head as to how Im going to implement it on the site.p  pThe content can very easily be broken down into blocks or chunks of data where I could allocate a textarea for text input, a couple of charfields for linkbuttons, etc and sequentially render them out to the page.p  pThe problem eg why Im not just pulling in DjangoCMS et al is the blocks are quite unique from each other. There are perhaps 20 different models that I would build for each block type. Rather than hack around a prefab CMS, Id like to build a Page model and then just have an M2M that links to an ordered list of subclasses of my abstract Block class. I hope Im not losing you.p  pI dont understand how I can do this. These questions spring to mindp  ul lipIs there a simple CMS that does all of this already Am I wasting my time trying to figure out the physicspli lipMy Blocks subclasses will technically be  different type. Do I need generics for a M2Mthrough class to link to them Is so, how do I do thatpli lipHow do I render x different forms in an inline admin context Id like to have the page form with a list of the Blocks underneathpli lipHow can the user specify the type of Block in the inline controlpli ul  hr  h2Edit Or, alternatively, what about a templatetagbased CMSh2  pIm thinking of something like plonking this in my templatep  precode editable uniqueid contenttype  codepre  pA further examplep  precode editable homeintro text  codepre  pThen I could just stick these around the templates I want to be editable, in the way I want them to be editable and when logged in the client would see Edit text, Edit link, Edit image links which simply popped up the right field.p  pThis would make things more locked down but the layout needs to remain solid and the client knows nothing about HTMLCSS so its one or other of these methods IMO.p

Negative 2443 pI have a PHP application form for medical health plans where the user fills in his details and selects some options from various controls, one of which is the plan type private of family plan.

Negative 2443 pIm getting some erratic results from Foursquares venue search API and Im wondering if anyone has any tips on how to process my input parameters for the most intuitive results.p  pFor example, suppose I am searching for a venue called Ise Sushi, around New York, NY, which is equivalent to lat 40.7143528, lon 74.00597309999999 using Google Maps API. Plugging into the Foursquare Venue API, we getp  precodehttpsapi.foursquare.comv2venuessearchqueryise20sushiampll40.71435282C74.00597309999999 codepre  pThis yields pretty underwhelming results the venue Im looking for ends up rather far down the list, at 11th place. Whats interesting is that strongreducing the precision of the coordinatesstrong appears to produce much better results. For example, suppose we were to round the coordinates to 3 significant digitsp  precodehttpsapi.foursquare.comv2venuessearchqueryise20sushiampll40.72C74.0 codepre  pThis time, the venue Im looking for ends up in 2nd place, even though it is actually emfartherem from the center of the search 1072 meters, vs. 833 meters using the first query.p  pAnother modification that appears to help improve the quality of search is strongsubstituting underscores for spacesstrong to separate our search terms. For example, heres the original query with underscoresp  precodehttpsapi.foursquare.comv2venuessearchqueryisesushiampll40.71435282C74.00597309999999 codepre  pThis produces the most intuitiveseeming results the venue Im looking for appears first, and is accompanied by just one other result, Ise Restaurant which is tagged as a sushi restaurant. For what its worth, this actually seems to be a hrefhttpsfoursquare.comsearchtabvenueResultsampqisesushiampnearNewYork2CNYthe result set of the same searcha conducted on Foursquares own website.p  pIm curious what lessons I should be learning from this. Should I be reducing the precision of my coordinates Should I be connecting my search terms with underscores, and if so, does that limit how a user can order their search termsp

Negative 2443 pIm trying to achieve the following Given an abstract class emMemoryObjectem, that every class can inherit from, I have two subclasses A emBufferem and a emBigBufferemp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class MemoryObject  public      typedef typename stdvectorltTgtiterator iterator     typedef typename stdvectorltTgtconstiterator constiterator      [...] Lot of stuff      virtual iterator begin  0     virtual iterator end  0  codepre  pA Bufferp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class Buffer public MemoryObjectltTgt  public     typedef typename stdvectorltTgtiterator iterator     iterator begin  return buffer.begin      iterator end  return buffer.end       [...] Lot of stuff  private     stdvectorltTgt buffer  codepre  pAnd finallyp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class BigBuffer public MemoryObjectltTgt  public     [...] Omitted, for now  private     stdvectorltBufferltTgtgt chunks  codepre  pAs you can see, a emBigBufferem holds a emstdvectorem of emBufferltTgtem, so you can view a BigBuffer as an aggregation of Buffers. Futhermore, I have a bunch of functions that must work of every MemoryObject, so this is a real signaturep  precodetemplate ltclass KernelType, typename Tgt void fillCommandQueueltKernelTypegtamp queue, MemoryObjectltTgtamp obj, const Tamp value     Do something with obj  codepre  pWhats the point  You may ask. The point is that I must implement iterators over these classes. Ive already implemented them for emBufferem, and is exactly what I need be able to iterate over a emBufferem, and access to ranges for example b.begin, b.begin  50. Obviously I cant do the same for emBigBufferem, because the real data that is inside each emBufferem private variable embufferem is scattered accross the memory. So I need a new class, lets call it emBigBufferIteratorem, which can overload operator like  or , allowing me to jump from a memory chunk to another without incurring in in segmentation fault.p  pThe problems are twop  ol liThe iterator type of emMemoryObjectem is different from the iterator type of emBigBufferem the former is a stdvectorltTgtiterator, the latter a emBigBufferIteratorem. My compiler obviously complains li liI want be able to preserve the genericity of my functions signatures passing to them only a MemoryObjectltTgtamp, not specializing them for each class type.li ol  pIve tried to solve the first problem adding a template parameter classed Iterator, and giving it a default argument to each class, with a model loosely based to Alexandrescus policybased model. This solution solved the first issue, but not the second my compiled still complains, telling me Not known conversion from BigBuffer to MemoryObject, when I try to pass a BigBuffer to a function for example, the fill . This is because Iterator types are different..p  pIm really sorry for this poem, but It was the only way to proper present my problem to you. I dont know why someone would even bother in reading all this stuff, but Ill take pot luck.p  pThanks in advance, only just for having read till this point.p  pHumbly, Alfredop

Negative 2443 pI was working on a game recently in C where I implemented the Command Pattern to manage keyboard input to control a spaceship. When instantiating all the commands, Id pass the spaceship pointer to each constructor so all commands were working with the same spaceship object.p  pThis pattern made sense in C because you can pass by reference, but in Java everything is passbyvalue. If I tried to implement the same thing in Java, how would I have each command pointing to the same objectp  pIn all the examples Ive seen of the Command Pattern used in Java it makes no difference whether the member variables of each Command are copies or references.p

Negative 2443 pHow to implement the following pattern nicely with a hint of arrrgh why cant I just use public variablesp  pI have a chunk of data that one set of classes can produce and another set of classes can consume. There are multiple ways to produce and consume this data. The data set has a fixed hierachical structure with value fields on multiple levels. I have numbers, enums, strings.p  pSo, in the prototype version of my application, I jotted a bunch of classes together in a completely public fashionp  precodepublic class AllData      public IdentifyData identifyData     public FirmwareData firmwareData     public VersionData versionData      public TestData testData     public ServiceData serviceData     public ErrorLog errorLog      public AllData              identifyData  new IdentifyData         versionData  new VersionData         firmwareData  new FirmwareData         testData  new TestData         serviceData  new ServiceData         errorLog  new ErrorLog         ...  public class FirmwareData      public DataStatus status      public int build     public int variant      public FirmwareData              status  new DataStatus              Etc. codepre  pNow Im doing the real version of the software and want to do things right, so I started propertying everything. However, I feel the code takes a hit by doing this. It gets large and ugly and the benefit is not appearent in my case.p  pI thought about using structs instead, but I really dont want to pass all this data by value all the time. Besides, there are some range and sanity checks here and there I need to do.p  pAny clues on how to implement this data model in a nice way beware that Im not very experienced in OOP and Cp  pIf possible, I would like to have the data become readonly when it is handed over to consumer classes, how could one do thatp  pThanks and best regardsp  pLarsp
Negative 2443 pIm recording Selenium tests using Selenium IDE to test the registration flow of my drupal site, which depends heavily on the rules module.p  pSome of the tests involve the registration of user accounts.  Since I will be using these tests on multiple servers with different amounts of users, I do not know upon starting the test which user ID to check for.  Since the user ID is in the URL, I was hoping to grab it and store it in Selenium.p  pUpon logging in, users are redirected to a URL like a hrefhttp192.168.100.1008888enuser6 relnofollowhttp192.168.100.1008888enuser6a, where 6 is the UID.p  pI imagine that I could use Seleniums storeValue command to do this, but what should I put as the target to pull the user ID out of the URLp

Negative 2443 pIm writing a method that will resize the columns in a datagridview so that all the data is visible, and the columns completely fill the datagridview.

This will show all the data in the cells.p  p2 Calculate the pixel distance between the right edge of the last column and the right edge of the data grid view.  p  p3 Divide that distance by the number of columns.  This gives me the width that should be added to each column to completely fill the datagridview.p  p4 Add the width from 3 to each column.p  pTheoretically, this will display all the data in the columns, and completely fill the datagridview.  p  pWith the codeDataGridViewAutoSizeColumnsModecode set to codefillcode, the column widths are all equal.

Negative 2443 pIm making a Django page that has a sidebar with some info that is loaded from external websitese.g. bus arrival times.p  pIm new to web development and I recognize this as a bottleneck. As it is, the page hangs for a fraction of a second as it loads the data from the other sites. It doesnt display anything until it gets this info because it runs python scripts to get the data before baking it into the html.p  pIdeally, it would display the majority of the page loaded directly off my web server and then have a little loading gif or something until it actually manages to grab the data before displaying that.p  pHow can I achieve this I presume javascript will be useful How can I get it to integrate with my existing poller scriptsp

I want to make Distribution a property of an Entity class.

They share most methods, but each type may have some custom methods too eg. setMean for NormalDistribution, setWeights for WeightedDistribution.p  pAs I understand it, C templates refer to a type, which is then used to determine which implementation to use. It was suggested that I implement the different distribution types using templates.p  pWhile I think I understand the concepts of C templates, Im not sure how I would go about implementing them to solve this Distribution problem.

Negative 2443 pNow I have this question where I was asked the cost of deleting a value from a hash table when we used linear probing while the insertion process.p  pWhat I could figure out from reading various stuff on the internet is that it has to do something with the load factor. Though I am not sure, but I read a relation between the load factor and no of probes required and it is No of probes  1  1LF.p  pSo I believe the cost has to be dependent on the probe sequence. But then another thought ruins everything.p  pWhat if the element was inserted in p probes and now I am trying to delete this element. But before this I had already deleted few elements having the same hash code and were a part of insertion in probes less than p. p  pIn this case I reach to a stage where I see a slot empty in the hash table but I am not sure if the element I am trying to delete is already deleted or is at some other location as a result of probing.p  pI also found that once I delete an element I must mark this slot with some special indicator to inform that it is available, but this doesnt solve my problem of being uncertain about the element which I am willing to delete.p  pCould anyone please suggest how to find the cost in such cases Is the approach going to vary if it is nonlinear probingp

Negative 2443 pI am trying a task that should probably be simple..I want one button at the bottom across the bottom of the screen floating preferably, while I have a scrollable list above that I was able to do this in a tutorial with a simple listview and buitton.But, my  list is a LinearLayout that I fill with a SimpleCursorAdapter and a viewBinder. Since I am using this LinearLayout I keep getting One button per line item, instead of one at the bottom of the screen. I have tried wrapping it with a table layout, relative layout, using two LinearLayouts, etc. Every time I get one button per line.

Negative 2443 pSo I created this fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netgDuzC2 relnofollowwhich displays the margin of a div against a div vs a div in a table against a divap  pthe surprise is that the margin in the later is twice as big because it seems that the margin gets applied twice against the table  once from the div in the table and once from the div below. This does not happen in case of the span.p  pI need to fix this issue and the solution dont use tables is not valid, since this will get applied to a big framework where these situations will occur quite often.p  pBasically the tables are used to easily fit things into columns.p  pstrong[EDIT]strongp  pwell I could just change the style inline  is correct  the point is  this is used for a framework. Lets say the framework generates a div with some content. This, lets call it component  should be possible to place anywhere on the page. The framework does not know about the last margin size. Itll just place the friggn div with its content somewhere and I just want the div to always have the same margin, whatever the last item was.p

Negative 2443 pI have a basic CRUD in a CMS, using EF and it was done using Database first, and the delete function does just that it deletes the record from the database. p  pThe following is the controller code for deletep  precode public ActionResult Deleteint id              DatabaseTable databasetable  db.DatabaseTable.Findid         return Viewdatabasetable            [HttpPost, ActionNameDelete]     public ActionResult DeleteConfirmedint id                          DatabaseTable databasetable  db.DatabaseTable.Findid         db.DatabaseTable.Removedatabasetable         db.SaveChanges         return RedirectToActionIndex           protected override void Disposebool disposing              db.Dispose         base.Disposedisposing       codepre  pNow for safety reasons from the clients point of view, instead of actually deleting the entry from the database table, I just want to alter a value in the database, namely Deleted, from N to Y and then I will hide it, then the entries that have a value of Y will not be displayed, via a custom query.

Negative 2443 pI am facing a problem with JQuery AJax calls.Basically I am using a RubyWatir automation script which continuously clicks on Next Page image in my GSP page.On click of this image,it makes an JQuery .ajax request to server.Server reads the content of particular file amp sends it back as a response.Now this response is directly rendered into one div as  document.getElementByIdcontent.innerHTML  responseTextp  pIn this scenario when I run my script, Chrome amp FF memory goes on increasing continuously. Please let me know the causes behind this as soon as possible..Also, there is a lot of processing amp event handling happening at client side.Please give me any pointers related to reduce this memory consumption at client side. I am stuck here guys .Please help me out in this issue. Thanks in advance..... Note  I have tried to nullify all the javascript variables also... Please help me in this.p

Negative 2443 pIm learning scala, play, and web services all at once so bear with me. Ive set up a little aggregator service that combines a weather web service and googles geocode and places web services. Ive got something working but Im a little confused on the proper way to handle errors. I posted the code at the end of the postp  pSo the places api uses latlong and so I use the geocode api to get latlong from the zip code. When processing the response from the call to the geocode api I end up with an codeOption[String], Option[String]code held in the codemaybeLoccode val. Inside the match statement that checks codemaybeLoccode, if it ends up being codeNone, Nonecode, I return codePromisecode because I need to return a codePromisecode from the flatmap call.p  pI have two questions about thisp  p1. What is the right way to handle the case of not being able to do any further processing while inside one of these flatMap or map calls It requires me to return a promise, but making an empty codePromisecode that will just time out when I go to redeem it seems like a really bad idea.p  p2. Am I right in assuming that the call to codePromisecode makes an empty promise object that will always time out when trying to redeem it I couldnt really tell from the scaladoc and couldnt find anything about it from google.p  pI hope my questions make sense to you and are clear enough.

Negative 2443 p[FYI Ive got the answer, and Im in process of writing the solution. This post is only for reference for others with similar problem]p  hr  pIm working on some small application on SymbianBelle platform. Everything was doing well until Ive hit a place where I had to parse a few JSON files. Ive found a QJson library, which seemed very relevant and easy to use although it seems to return everything as QVariantMap, which probalby is not that lightweight...p  pThis library is however not provided in a precompiled form. It is sourceonly. Fortunatelly, it is prepared to compile under QtCreators Symbian projects.p  pAfter some initial setups and minor fixes, everything ran smoothly on the Simulator, so, the next step was to run it on the real device. Here some problems began.

Of course the application was launching properly back when the jsonrelated code and library was not yet added to the project..p  pIve checked the suggested thing and the QJson library was indeed properly installed on the device, so it was not about missing files. Also, the application it self has been properly installed too I could even try to run it manually. Doing that resulted in an errorp  blockquote   pUnable to execute file for security reasonsp blockquote  pWhat is going on How to fix itp

Negative 2443 pMy session cookie is somewhat long about 700 bytes, since it contains various encrypted user information and what not.  Theres some things I can do to get that size down, and Im working on that angle too, but thats another topic.p  pMy issue is that I dont like how this cookie gets sent to the server on every single HTTP request including requests to JPG images, CSS files, and static Javascript files.

Obviously, these files get cached and what not but still Id like my pages to load and quickly and smoothly as possible.p  pThe one solution I can think of is to put all my static content on another subdomain, such as codecdn.myserver.comimagescode and codecdn.myserver.comscriptscode, and set the cookiepath to only include codewww.myserver.comcode.

Area Ordino, 42.6, 1.55p  pI then take one of these values, say area, add it to a hash of data, and pass it to a web page where it is preprocessed via TT as I do successfully with a load of other variables.p  pIm assigning the value to the hash in the normal way. e.g.  hasharea  areap  pHere is where the fun begins.  When I try to reference the value in TT e.g. [ hash.area ] I dont get Ordino printed on the web page, Im told Ive passed an Array reference to TT.p  pAfter a little debugging, Ive found that my hash variable hash.area, is somehow referencing an array according to TT holding the three values that Ive returned from the subroutine release. I.e.      hash.area  [42.6, 1.55, ordino] according to TT.p  pThat is, to get the value Ordino within the web page, I have to access [ hash.area.2 ].p  pFurther, I can set hasharea to equal any of the variables, lat, lng, or area and get the same behavior.  TT believes all three variables reference the same array. that isp  plat  lng  area  [42.6, 1.55, ordino] according to TTp  pThis is bizare, I can happily print the variables in perl and they appears as normal  not an array.  Ive tried dumping the hash with dumper, no array, everything is fine.  Yet somehow, TT is finding an array.  Its doing my head in.p  pThe site is quite large, with a lot of pages and I happily pass variables and hashes via TT to web pages all the time, and have been for 4 years now. Ive never seen this. On other pages, I even pass exactly the same output from the release method and it is processed correctly.p  pI dont emthinkem my TT processing code is the problem, however the following is relevant.p  precodemy tt  Templategtnew     INCLUDEPATH gt [ templatedirectories ],     COMPILEEXT gt .ttc,     COMPILEDIR gt tmpttc,     FILTERS gt YMGNViewgtfilters,     PLUGINBASE gt [ YMGNVTTPlugins ],     EVALPERL gt 1   selfgttt  tt selfgttemplatedirectories  templatedirectories selfgtoutput  paramsgtoutput  undef selfgtdata  paramsgtdata  [] codepre  pThe above creates a new tt object and is part of the new function refed below. data contains the hash.  output holds the processed template ready to send to users browser.

Because most of persons working on this project are not coders we have designed very simple inhouse markup language for UI generation. An example of markup of simple view is followingp  precodeFirst name [Person.FirstName] Last name [Person.LastName] Address [Person.Address.Street], [Person.Address.City] codepre  pNow these templates are loaded at runtime and usercontrols are created based on them. In this case one usercontrol would be created and it would contain simply couple of stack panels and text blocks so that resulting control would look a bit like text document. XAML equivalent would be something likep  precodeltStackPanelgt     ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontalgt         ltTextBlock TextFirst name gt         ltTextBlock TextBinding Person.FirstName     ltStackPanelgt     ltStackPanelgt         ...     ltStackPanelgt     ... ltStackPanelgt codepre  pThen, I started to implement support for lists but couldnt think of a way how to do that.

There would be no problems if my UserControls were strongtypesstrong, but they are not.p  pOne possible solution is that I could bind emItemsControl.Itemsem directly to list of UserControls instead of binding to emItemsSourceem and emItemTemplateem but this is suboptimal in our case for couple of reasons.

Negative 2443 pIm newbie with this so forgive me with any mistakes...p  pMy situationp  precode idinitWith... Some arguments codepre  pTheres an initialization method that returns an object. It does a lot of work to set its instance variables with the values of the arguments. To maximize performance I divide the job in two threads. One thread sets a set of related variables and the other thread another bunch of them.p  precode idinitWitharguments  self  [super init] if self  [NSThread detachNewThreadSelectorselectorsetFirstSetOfVariables toTargetself withObjectargObject] [self setSecondSetOfVariablesarguments] Check if the thread finished its work and return the value return self  codepre  pTo make it easy think both sets of vars that the method has to set dont have any relationship. Then my question is how do I check if the first thread finished I could create a BOOL var but Id have to create a loop to check. I could also call a method to say its ready. But as I dont know a lot of it, I dont know wether a method invoked inside a thread would be run in the main thread or in the other. Sorry. Thank you for any info.p

For example difference between hour 21 and 03 is 6 hours. Nothing special and app works. p  pBut i have a problem. When i click calculate button i experience some unusual delay. Its like when i click button it takes 3 seconds to calculate on emulator. On my phone it takes like half of second. But you can see that calculating is not instant. But when i want to calculate the second time, then it does instant with no problem. On actual phone and emulator.

Negative 2443 pI have a problem with Apache Jena TDB. Basically I create a new Dataset, load data from an RDFXML file into a named model with the name httpexample.commodelfilename where filename is the name of the XMLRDF file. After loading the data, all statements from the named model are inserted into the default model. The named model is kept in the dataset for backup reasons.p  pWhen I now try to query the named models in the Dataset, TDB freezes and the application seems to run in an infinite loop, so it is not terminated nor does it throw an exception.p  pWhat is causing that freeze and how can I prevent itp  pExample codep  precodeDataset ds  TDBFactory.createDatasettdb Model mod  ds.getDefaultModel  File f  new Fileexample.rdf FileInputStream fis  new FileInputStreamf  ds.beginReadWrite.WRITE   Get a new named model to load the data into Model nm  ds.getNamedModelhttpexample.commodelexample.rdf nm.readfis, null   Do some queries on the Model using the utility methods of Model, no SPARQL used   Add all statements from the named model to the default model mod.addnm  ds.commit ds.end   So far everything works as expected, but the following line causes the freeze IteratorltStringgt it  ds.listNames codepre  pAny method call that accesses the existing named models causes the same freeze reaction, so this is the same for codegetNamedModelhttpexample.commodelexample.rdfcode for example. Adding new named models by calling codegetNamedModelhttpexample.commodelexample123.rdfcode works fine, so only access to existing models is broken.p  pUsed environment Linux 64bit, Oracle Java 1.7.009, Jena 2.7.4 incl. TDB 0.9.4p  pThanks in advance for any helpp  pEdit Fixed mistake in code fragmentp  pEdit2 Solution my last comment to AndyS answerp  pOk, I went through the whole program and added all missing transactions. Not it is working as expected. I suspect Jena throwing an Exception during the shutdown sequence of my program but that Exception was not reported properly and the freeze was caused by other threads not terminating correctly. Thanks for pointing the faulty transaction usage out.p

Negative 2443 pUrgent Help Reqiredp  pI am working on an ASP.NET Webforms application that reads MS Excel spreadsheets and loads the data into SQL Server. The application works fine on Win Server 2003 Which has MS Office installed. p  pDuring our migration of the software onto a Win Server 2008 Which does not have MS Office installed the application fails with a COM error message, Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID 0002450000000000C000000000000046 failed due to the following error 80040154. p  pThis I assume is because even though we have the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.dll within the applications sub directories the application cannot find the Excel application.p  pNow, here is the problem. Our infrastructure team refuses to install MS Office or Excel onto the server. They are adamant in their claim that there are workarounds out there that will allow the application to work with Excel without the installation of ms office or excel.p  pPersonally, I have never come accross any such solutions and from articles that I have read seem to confirm thisp  pDoes anybody know if there is any way to get an ASP.NET application working with MS Excel, when MS OFfice or Excel is not installed p

Negative 2443 pI have a TextBox and as its content grows I want it to grow and as its content shrinks I want it to shrink in terms of both its Height and Width. This can be easily achieved by hooking to the TextChanged event in TextBox, which means codebehind, something that we should avoid in MVVM. So the question is how do we do this in MVVM  We have to use Commands obviously classes implementing ICommand interface, at the same time we cannot hook Commands to events.p  pOne option is to use System.Windows.Interactivity.

Negative 2443 pI am new to Cocos2D and CocosBuilder and I have a few questions regarding memory usages.p  p1 In CocosBuilder or Cocos2D for that matter, if I use the same texture atlas spritesheet for ALL CCSprite objects in the same scene, would it save memory usage over separate texture for each sprite  To be precise, if I use one 4k4k texture, will the game require memory for only one texture atlas e.g. 4k  4k  32 bitsp  p2 Can I use different texture modes for different sprites to save memory For instance, using noalpha mode for background image. In other words, can Cocos2D handle different texture modes in the same scenep  p3 I have to implement a game with around 100 objects on a scene, three scenes in total.  Right now, all objects on the same scene are using the same spritesheet. Still, the game crashes after switching between scenes for a couple of times. Each time I got memwarning message. What would be the best way to resolve this issue I tried to dump all those caches but still got the crash.p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 2443 pI have three breeze entities, my application is a long form that adds records to all three tables at once before going to the server for a save. Two of the tables Drivers amp Vehicles have a relationship to AutoLead and need the AutoLeadId from the AutoLead table that is being entered all at once on the client side.p  pSo I have a form, the user entered information into AutoLead, then adds records into the Drivers and Vehicles tables in one seamless form. How do I get the Id to assign to Drivers and Vehicles without first separating the saves out, and saving the AutoLead first, returning the new Id and then assigning it to Drivers and Vehicles before saving them again. I want to avoid multiple trips to the server just to generate the Ids for the navigation properties on Vehicles and Drivers.p  pFrom what i understood, breeze was supposed to be able to fixup these IDs using the temporary IDs from the client side it creates. But when i go to do a save it isnt changing these IDs. According to a hrefhttpwww.breezejs.comdocumentationnavigationproperties relnofollowhttpwww.breezejs.comdocumentationnavigationpropertiesap  pIf i try to set the navigation property directly with objects, I get an undefined error for the navigation property See code below. Using another approach, If I try to set the foreign key directly on their Ids I get a foreign key error from SQL because its trying to push 1 to the server the temporary IDs.

Negative 2443 pI have a Campaign class, a Hotel Class and an Image class.  p  pA Hotel has many Images and Campaigns, but a Campaign and Image can only have one Hotel.  p  pI want with Play Framework 2.x to select the top 5 Campaigns and their respective Hotel and its Images and put it into a nice JSON like codeJson.toJsoncode method does.  p  pHow can I accomplish this Ive been searching for hours, looked at FetchType LAZY and EAGER and tried all kinds of stuff but i found nothing to work.

Negative 2443 pThis is probably very odd, but Im using multiple CursorLoaders in Android to do multiple queries and in the onLoadFinished, I am adding views like TextViews and ListViews to my layout dynamically based on cursor results like if the cursors were not null. I do get accurate results, but since Im using AsyncTaskLoader CursorLoader, the cursor results dont come in at the same time and the results are not added in the correct order. I previously used a static layout and added views at indices and did view.setVisiblityView.GONE based on the results, but it was just too much and too confusing because I have like 32 views. Plus it seemed weird because I dont think the user wants to see all of those views going away and moving up and down based on AsyncTaskLoader results. How can I get the views in the correct order I want them in without having a bunch of boolean variables I looked into LayoutInflater but that requires indices as well, but Im not sure that will help me. The problem with indices for me is that in cursorloader ID 1p  precode    view.addViewv, 1     view.addViewv, 2 codepre  pmight not get executed until the cursorloader with ID 2 finishes withp  precode    view.addViewv, 3     view.addViewv, 4 codepre  pIf cursorLoader ID 1 doesnt get executed and ID 2 does, then there is missing space and I have to do a ton of view.setVisibilityView.GONE if I use static XML views and do not dynamically add them. p  pIn the code Im doing something like this currentlyp  precode     Override      public void onLoadFinishedandroid.support.v4.content.LoaderltCursorgt cursorLoader, Cursor cursor        switch cursorLoader.getId                  case 0                    if cursor  null ampamp cursor.moveToFirst                        ..                       title  new TextViewthis                       ...                       mainLinearLayout.addViewtitle, 1                                        break            case 1                     if cursor  null ampamp cursor.moveToFirst                        ..                    title2  new TextViewthis                    mainLinearLayout.addViewtitle2, 2                    break            default                    ...      codepre  pp  pI also read somewhere online that it is better to use a service instead of cursorloader if you want to do queries on the background thread and have them finish in a certain order, but I have not heard that advice anywhere else or seen any examples doing queries in services. They all use CursorLoader. Is this advice necessarily true Sounds a bit sketchy.p  pBy the way, I am using the CursorLoader implementation without a content provider given at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7182485usagecursorloaderwithoutcontentprovider74223437422343Usage CursorLoader without ContentProviderap

Negative 2443 pWe recently upgraded an MVC3 application to MVC4 and .Net 4.5. The upgrade was done by creating a new MVC4 site and adding all the controllers etc back in, manually.p  pThe site was deployed internally to a win2008 R2 64 bit server, on which we installed .Net 4.5.p  pWhen we browse to the web site with IE8 or IE9 the application works well for a while as we navigate through various pages, including standard views, partial views, popups, paged lists etc.p  pAt some point we end up going to a page in the site any page, complex or not and IE8 and 9 both just sit there for a long time usually 13 minutes and displaying the page loading progress bar eventually they both show the page as requested. Often the same behaviour occurs on the following few pages and then magically comes right for a whilep  pIf we browse to the same web site in Chrome, Ie10, Safari, FF at there are no issues at all. If we browse to the web site with one of these browsers from the same machine while the ie89 are loading then we can still access the site quite happily without any issues.p  pA check of task manager memory and performance on the client, web server and database server shows almost no CPU usage and no increased memory usage while this is happening. It is almost as if the browser is just taking a tea break. Fiddler shows nothing unusual either.p  pIt should be noted that as this is an SAAS application we are managing multiple databases through the same site and these are configured into the users session state based on an incoming url in the web site bindings. Having said that as far as we can tell, the session state is remaining intact. a The browser does eventually return with the expected data, b there are no recycling events recorded in the event log in fact there are no events at all around the time this issue occursp  pApplication pool is set to framework 4.0.30319, integrated, enable 32bit, max worker processes  1p  pWe reverted the web site on the server back to the original MVC3 implementation and still retained the .net4.5 install on the web server. This now exhibits the same fault as the mvc4 site.p  pWe reimaged the server to a state before the .net4.5 was installed, ran the MVC3 site and everything operated again as we would expect. Repeating the install caused the same problem again.p  pIt is almost like the .net4.5 install on the server has caused some problems for the IE89 browser. Back to fiddler again, which shows different host headers for the different version of .Net, but that seems to be the only difference.p  pWhilst we would love to be able to tell the users not to use ie89 that is not practical, so now we are completely stuck.p  pAny help  ideas will be appreciated. Thanks.p

From other blog posts I also found that one should setup JAVAOPTS variable to assign jacoco agent before tomcat starts.li ol  pfor ex setting JAVAOPTS variable likep  precodeexport JACOCOXms256m Xmx512m XXMaxPermSize1024m javaagentproductionjenkinsAKSjobsNewAppworkspacejacoco0.6.3.201306030806libjacocoagent.jardestfileproductionjenkinsAKSjobsNewAppworkspacejacocojacoco.exec,appendtrue,includes export JAVAOPTSJAVAOPTS JACOCO codepre  ol lipBeing new to Gradlegroovy  Im not sure what code should I write within build.gradle build script to get the above IntegrationUnit tests working if it involves startstop of tomcat.

Negative 2443 pI am working on a phonegap application. It is only for portrait view. On Devices more than 4 Inches, my screens seems so small and there is 25 empty space under the contentjQueryMobile form controls, to fill empty space I had the option to increase size of fonts and heights e.t.c. but that wasnt good because it will have bigger fields and font sizes on small devices which are 3.2 inches high. p  pSo I am setting fontsize after some calculation according to height of device, it seems better. As it fit for device but as fontsize increase in both width and height, so fonts and elements were messing up because fontsize was bigger with respect to width. This can be solved by reducing the calculated size. But then the problem is that some devices are 5.3 inches high but have same width as 3.2 inches phone. p  pMy requirement is not to exactly fit the screen and no empty space but to fill enough space and look same on most of devices. So if there is some other way to achieve this thing, either by using different unit like percentages or em e.t.c. then those solutions are very welcome. And any effort will be appreciated.p

Negative 2443 phope everyone is doing well.p  pGot an issue I would like to pick the great brains in this forum about.p  pSo, I have many Debian machines I often remote into using Teamviewer and a Windows machine, which works out great however Teamviewer crashes for what appears to be no apparent reason. When such happens, normally I will PuTTY into the suspect Debian machine from a Windows 7 machine and issue the shutdown r now command. When the debian computer reboots, so does Teamviewer and the suspect Debian machine is now visible in the My computers list on my Windows machine.p  pMy question is this, why cant I just type teamviewer from the command line while PuTTYing into the Debian machine and have Teamviewer reopen on the Debian machine, making it visible in My computers When I execute teamviewer command from PuTTY command line, I see the verbose output of teamviewer opening, but the machine never becomes visible in My computers.p  pNow, I know it is possible to start Teamviewer remotely and have it show up back in My computers list. I can do it via NoMachine I simply connect to the suspect Debian machine and double click on the Teamviewer desktop launcher. However, NoMachine is very heavy and quite frankly, i just dont like it. I also know I can execute teamviewer via command line while sitting in front of the suspect Debian machine. PuTTY would be so much faster.p  pI have also tried VNC as well as X sessions. In both cases, i can open Teamviewer and it shows up in My computers, but when I close the VNC of X, Teamviewer also closes and removes itself from My computers.p  pCan someone help me figure out a way to restart Teamviewer via PuTTY please Is there a way to open a desktop launcher via PuTTYs command line Or is there a way to tell Teamviewer to execute in the suspect Debian machines active desktop session via PuTTYs command linep  pThanks allp

Negative 2443 pFirst of all, Im fairly new to Ruby, Rails and ActiveRecord, so detailed answers would be very appreciated.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve is a model with a ManytoMany relation to itself. Its basically a user has many friends aka users setup.p  pThis is what I currently have for my tablesp  precodecreatetable friendships do t   t.integer userid   t.integer friendid end  createtable users do t   t.string   email,   t.string   username,    etc. end codepre  pAnd this is what I have for my modelsp  precodeclass Friendship lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto user   belongsto friend, classname User end  class User lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany friendships   hasmany friends, through friendships end codepre  pFrom what Ive been reading, this should be giving me what I want. However, when I try to access code.friendscode on the codeUsercode object I receive an codeuninitialized constant Friendcode error. I searched for a while without luck. I really dont know how to tackle this issue, it must be something simple that I missed.p  pIm using Rails 4.0.1 on Ruby 2.0.0p247 if it helps.p
Negative 2443 pFor example, if I have a dictionary that lists farm animals, it would be as followsp  precodegroupA[cow,lamb,lamb,lamb], groupB[cow,cow] codepre  pHow would I be able to count the number of times each value appears for the corresponding key I want groupA cow 1, groupA lamb 3, groupB cow 2. The even trickier part is that the dictionary is not fixed, it needs to be dynamic. There may be more keys that go on past groupB ex. groupC, group D and might have more or less values associated with it. I have figured out a static way by popping out each key then using the if function to see what it contains then put a counter to it. The only two animals will be either cow or lamb. I unfortunately cannot determine how to do this dynamically because I will never know how many keys there will be. Thank you guys so much for the help. I couldnt find the answer anywhere and am extremely frustrated at the moment. p

However they produce errors at various points specifically codewpincludesposttemplate.phpcode line 29 because they need to use things like a hrefhttpcodex.wordpress.orgFunctionReferencegettheID relnofollowgettheida, a hrefhttpcodex.wordpress.orgFunctionReferenceincategory relnofollowincategorya and properties of the post object to highlight certain posts and so on and no post has been loaded yet.p  pHow can I tell Wordpress to load a specific post ID in the code above, as if Id gone to a URL like codehttpexample.comp1code, but without outputting a full page  I just want the environment to be setup as if post was active, then I can pass the current post ID as a parameter in my ESI call.p  pI thought a hrefhttpcodex.wordpress.orgFunctionReferencequeryposts relnofollowquerypostsa might help and I tried addingp  precodequeryposts p5  codepre  pbut it doesnt do anything.p  pI also wondered about codeWPPostgetinstancecode it only seems to take an object though, not a post ID.  p  pIs there anything else I can use p

Negative 2443 pI am trying to provide access to a function linked in to an executable from a static library. The original static library defines the symbol with no access specifiers, and I was able to access the function using the method defined a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2991927howtoforceinclusionofanobjectfileinastaticlibrarywhenlinkingintoeherea, which works fine using MSVC as linked in symbols are hidden by default. p  pHowever, when using GCC, I need to export the function while using Wl,excludelibs,ALL which keeps all other unnecessary symbols from being visibly exported from linkedin static libraries. The symbol in question is not referenced from the main application itself, however third party modules may attempt to dynamically use the symbol externally ffi etc, hence the use of FORCEUNDEFINEDSYMBOL.p  pThe only symbols I need exported are those marked visibility default from the main application, and certain imported functions from static libraries which I may not be able to modify. I know wrapper functions could be used, however Im wondering if there is any other way.p  pSo, is it possible to export a symbol visibly from a linkedin static library, while using WL,excludelibs,ALL, without the use of any additional versionlists etc files, or commandsflags And without modifying the static libraryp  pUsing the following macros partially work, however the original function symbol is still .hidden with MyFunctionfp exported as visible.p  precodedefine APIEXPORT attribute visibility default define FORCEUNDEFINEDSYMBOLx extern APIEXPORT void xvoid APIEXPORT void   x  fp voidampx FORCEUNDEFINEDSYMBOLMyFunction codepre  pIn this instance, the actual definitiondeclaration of MyFunction would exist in a static library, and cannot be changed.p  pstrongEDITstrong I discovered that the above macro FORCEUNDEFINEDSYMBOL does not produce the desired symbol visibility under MSVC. It seems that the only working solution is using pragma comments, ie, pragmacomment linker, export x. Maybe a similar solution exists for gccld.p

Negative 2443 pWhile refactoring my main css into a modular approach Im using media all  to wrap css modules in the IDE.

Negative 2443 pThis is going to be difficult to explain but Ill try.p  pI am using UIrouter in an angular app and would like t use the following URLSp  precodecontacts contactsid codepre  pWhen you visit the contacts page it will get a list of contacts from the server and display them.

If the user goes to contacts8 then It would still activate the parent state but not the default state so it never goes to the server to get the contacts.p  pI hope that makes sense.

The provided script does not work. p  pThere must be someone who uses Maven and ENSIME successfullyI hope.

The semantics highligher amp some other things still arent working very well, but I can jump to definitions and use the type inspector.p  pAll in all, its much closer to working completely. p

Negative 2443 pHello everyone I just started learning C through THE c PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE Second Edition by Brian. W.Kernighnan ISBN13 9788131704943p  pSo here is a script which counts the characters, line, wordsp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  define IN  1 define OUT 0  main      int c, nl, nw, nc, state       c  input, nl  new line, nc  new character, nw  new word, state  INOUT      state  OUT     nl  nw  nc  0     while c  getchar  EOF              nc         if c  n             nl         if c     c  n  c  t             state  OUT         else if state  OUT                      state  IN             nw                   printf The number of lines is d,n The number of words is d,n The number of characters is d. n, nl, nw, nc  codepre  pHowever I made a script which does the following without the need of defining state IN and OUTp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt main      int nw, nl, nc, c      nl  nw  nc  c  0      while c  getchar  EOF              nc         if c  n             nl         else if c     c  n  c  t             nw          printfWordsd nCharactersd nLinesd, nw, nc, nl  codepre  pSo what is the difference between these two, why does the author use the state to define IN and OUT p  p[EDIT] Oh I see so the script is just to avoid two things  1. To avoid word count when there are more than one spaces following the word. 2. Secondly my script would count n2 words I suppose if proper spacing is done. Which makes the authors script more fullproof.....Is there anything else except these two p  pAnd thank You for your answes too....p  pP.S Im sorry this is a bit offtopic is it ok to label the question [SOLVED] or is there any other way of doing this p

Negative 2443 pemI think this could be a common question, but I didnt find my answer, so thats the reason I am asking this. I am sorry if I am being repetitive.emp  pI have a page with some categories. And each category has some category as its  children. And, the user can click in this categories and the scope.categories will change with those children, until we have no children anymore.p  pBut, when the user clicks in a category to show its children, I want to change the URL, to make a permalink for the visible category at the time.p  pI tried to use location, but location does not change my absURL, it just set a anchor at the end of the URL, like pathcategoryslug. I want to change to pathcategoryslug. The reason is that I want to index those URLs in search engines.p  pSo, if the user entry in pathcategoryslug, I will change scope.categories based in the categoryslug.p  pMy question is, what is the best options to do thisp

Negative 2443 pIf, for whatever reason, a project demanded that a single page contain more than one form, are there any best practices for error handling of incomplete forms when one of the forms gets submitted before othersp  pIn other words, lets say we have two forms on a single page codemyCatcode and codemyDogcode and those forms have three input boxes codecatNamecode, codecatColorcode, codecatSpeciescode and a submit button codemyDogcode has three input boxes codedogNamecode, codedogColorcode, codedogSpeciescode and its own submit button .  Now, we have to be prepared for the user that makes a few entries on one form, but doesnt submit it before proceeding to another form and submitting that one.  If, for instance, a user enters a value for codecatNamecode, and then proceeds to complete all of the codemyDogcode entries and submits the codemyDogcode form, it seems like the user should be asked if they prefer to save the codecatNamecode entry as well.  I recognize that this example is best solved with two fieldsets in the same form.  I use the example as an illustration.p  pAre there any examples or recommendations for how to evaluate incomplete forms and warn users before they unknowingly navigate away from or refresh a page as the result of a form submissionp

Negative 2443 pSo Ill try to describe the problem in detail, and Id like some critique on the validity and performance of the process I use to solve it. My main concern is the validity, which I cannot seem to prove.p  pThe idea is that we have a 2D polygon in 3D space which is described by all its hull points. Each point also has a strikenormalstrikevector which indicates an infinite extrusion. I apologize for using the misleading term normal, its just a normalized vector that represents a normal in a broader context not relevant to this algorithm. To completely clarify, these vectors are neither perpendicular to the plane nor the same on each point. As can be seen in the following image, where the vectors are the red linesp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comkuhC1Id.png altPolygonp  pThis means that the sides of this extrusion do not form a flat, but a skewed plane. One can look at its extrusion sides like a Skew polygon a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSkewpolygon relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSkewpolygona.p  pAnyway, Id like to see if a point P is inside the extrusion or not. My current procedure is as followsp  ol liCalculate normal NABxBC where A,B,C are any three clockwise points on the 2D polygon. This gives me the 2D polygon plane normal.li liCalculate the final plane variable D to get NxXNyYNzZD  0. Do this by filling in point P in X,Y,Z. This gives the extruded plane.li liExtrude the normals at all hull points to get the new hull on the extruded plane. Simply done by finding the intersection of the line they define and the plane.li liHere comes the tricky part. Now I have a convex hull on a 3D plane where I know the point is coplanar. I have seen a lot of solutions already on stackoverflow concerning solving linear systems, etc... but they either do not consider 3D, lack a good implementation or look too expensive.li ol  pMy approach is using an assumption that I think is both necessary emandem sufficient but I cannot prove that last part the necessary part is obvious. I make the following claimp  pemFor coplanar convex hull consisting of points AZ and an additional coplanar point P. Then P is within the convex hull if and only if for all clockwise sequential points A and B and some other third sequential point C the line CP passes through P before passing through the line AB.emp  pIn the example image above AB is crossed by DP going through P before AB, for BC this is achieved by A, for CD also by A and for DA by B.p  pI implement this idea as two 3D parametric lines crossing eachother AB and PC and looking at the parameters sign. The parameter in PC should be nonpositive because the crossing point should lie behind P for a parameter going to C.p  pIn essence this would result in a strikeOnstrikeOn2 algorithm with n being the points of the polygon strikewhich seems to beat all solutions Ive seen so farstrike. However, even though I cannot find a counterexample to the above assumption, I also cannot prove it.p  pstrikeEdit I believe it is possible to prove that a sufficient condition is that for A and B, all other hull points need to satisfy the assumption and not just C.strikep  pEdit2 Clarified claim.p

Negative 2443 pIm getting my feet wet in the world of Android, and Im looking to write an app that communicates with a RESTful API Ive written. For security purposes, I plan on using OAuth2 to ensure the identity of each client app that communicates with the API. Im still fairly new to OAuth2, but from my understanding, it will be necessary to store the authorization code andor the refresh token for each client on his device correct me if Im wrong.p  pObviously, such data should be encrypted when stored locally on the client device. My question is this are there any means that another presumably malicious app could employ to steal the data once its already on the device Though the likelihood of such a thing occurring is marginal, its still a concern I have for both academic and practical reasons.p  pA few scenarios occurred to me as I was considering p  ul liWould the aforementioned app be able to read the decrypted data in the background once my app has decrypted itli liWould the app be able to locate the file I use to store the data and send it to a remote server for the hacker to decrypt through his own meansli liWould the app be able to intercept the data as its being queued for an HTTPS requestli ul

Negative 2443 pemThis is a design question. I hope that is acceptable here.emp  pBack in the days of yore, I worked on an accounting system that used flat files to store records in a proprietary format. The transaction table stored multiple types of transactions in the format of a fixed header which held the transaction type amongst other things and a detail record that varied according to the transaction type.p  pWe did this in C using structs and unions to manage the records.p  pOnce again I find myself working on a finance system, only this time Im doing it in Rails with PostgreSQL as the target database.p  pIm currently considering the design of the transaction system in this new project and Im wondering how to do this in the best, Rails way.p  ul lipDo I have multiple tables, one for each transaction type journals, sales, purchases, etc Does this violate DRYpli lipOr, do I have a single transaction table that represents the header, and multiple tables for the detail of each type p  pIf I do it this way, how do associations work Can an association use a single id to connection to multiple tablespli lipOr, do I have a single, unnormalized record with every possible field for the complete range of transaction typespli lipOr... is it possible to overload a table record in the way I did this so many years agopli ul  pNot really keen to do it this way though.p  pAny ideas you have on this will be appreciated.p

The LPC1788 relies on a version of the Thumb instruction set specific to CortexM3 microcontrollers, which can be found a hrefhttpinfocenter.arm.comhelpindex.jsptopiccom.arm.doc.ddi0432cCHDCICDF.html relnofollowherea or in the a hrefhttpwww.google.co.ukurlsatamprctjampqampesrcsampsourcewebampcd1ampved0CCEQFjAAampurlhttp3A2F2Fwww.nxp.com2Fdocuments2Fusermanual2FUM10470.pdfampeiONcFVPjbDoj07AbBnYGIAQampusgAFQjCNH6iShRhguy6UWIivOODuJRwnZDQampsig2vOJWsu47uu19aqwwfhg08wampbvmbv.74115972,d.ZGU relnofollowuser manuala on page 918.p  pLooking through it, though, I cant find anything like a testandset instruction.

Negative 2443 pI have a page in my django project with many forms and it would be much more elegant of a design if the form descriptors appeared inside the entry boxes in faded gray text and disappeared as soon as the user started entering text into the box. Im not sure how to go about doing this, but Im guessing its jqueryjs Is there any other builtin django ways to do this that I am not seeing If not, what is the best way to go about doing it in js then The pic below is what I mean. Notice how toolbars like facebooks search have the prompt text inside the entry box while my link entry form in my app is outside of the box. p  pa hrefhttpimgur.comglirRLj relnofollowhttpimgur.comglirRLjap  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 2443 pI have a .net webform NewShift.ascx file. It provides you an interface to add information about a new shift youll be working or just worked. So things like how many hours you worked, your shift manager, etc. In my code behind Id like to change the date created labels text to be the current date DateTime.Now if and only if its before 5pm today, otherwise make the date read tomorrow for reasons I wont go into.p  pIn addition, I might want to format the date a certain way based upon the user for example if theyre associated w one culture vs. another as per settings saved in the database, not the current country they are browsing the site in.p  pYou could argue because its such simple logic, I could just write it out in the code behind, but lets say I had a lot of these little simple things going on changing values, formatting dates, displaying values based on logic, etc.p  pMy understanding is this would be the smart UI antipattern if I did all of this in the code behind. Where should the above logic be p  pI hear about not having an anemic domain model and making sure my entities can provide functionality for answering domainspecific questions . I also hear about leveraging service layers as much as possible for things as well.p  pSo if I had to do the followingp  ol liChange a labels text to either today, or tomorrow, based on X and Yli liAdd two values together and assign a label text to that sum based on a user preferenceli liconditionally hide a checkbox based upon the day of the weekli ol  pWhere should logic like this be On the Shift object Or some sort of shiftServicep  pThanksp

Negative 2443 pI created a virtual image of win7.  I want the win7image to support 4 cpus.p  pBut I created the image from a lowconfiguration machine, which has only 2 phisical cpus.

Negative 2443 pI have a Nodejs application and Im using a Javascript library which performs some Ajax calls. Library is written in a way that it throws errors from a onreadystatechange method and I have to be able to catch these errors somehow. I tried using domains but errors dont get caught. How could I catch these errorsp  pA simplified example of the situation is belowp  precodevar d  domain.create d.onerror, functionerr      console.logCaught   err.stack   d.runfunction       here Im actually invoking a function from my lib      which deep inside has an Ajax call like this     var url  someurl     var r  new XMLHttpRequest      r.openGET, url, true     r.onreadystatechange  function           if r.readyState  4 return            Request succeeded         ifr.status  200              some work if successful                   Request failed         else              I need to catch this            throw Failed to fetch online reference via ajax url                   r.send  codepre  pI know it would be the best to provide a callback function for errors, but it would require some extensive refactoring of this lib, which is quite large and not written by me, so Im looking for some other solutions to handle these errors.p

Negative 2443 pIm working with a fairly large JavaScript project and trying to refactor it to persuade it to behave in more of a JavaScripty way. One thing I really want to bring in is to make inheritance available as this is a very good fit for much of the work I am doing, but it seems a little hard to use prototypes and inheritance in a way that is easy to read and follow without dissolving into JavaScript jam.p  pI have got to something like thisp  precodeMyMammal  function name       if  0 lt arguments.length              this.initname       MyMammal.prototype       init function name           this.name name     ,      getName function          return this.name       codepre  pThen for classes that derive from codeMyMammalcodeI work this wayp  precodeMyDog  function name, breed       if  0 lt arguments.length                this.init name, breed        MyDog.prototype  Object.create MyMammal.prototype   .extend MyDog.prototype,      init function name, breed               this.name  name         this.breed  breed     ,      getBreed function               return this.breed       codepre  pNow this works in so far as I get the outcomes I expect from method calls but JavaScript doesnt seem to know that codeMyMammalcode is the prototype of codeMyDogcode if I try to use codeisPrototypeOfcode although it does recognise that an instance of codeMyDogcode is an codeinstanceof MyMammalcode. p  pAs I understand it, in addition to the conventional advantages of being able to create subclasses easily, JavaScript prototypes also share functions, so using them well should be more memory efficient. My question is firstly whether this model will be able to take advantage of that  I cant see why it wouldnt, but thats why Im asking  and secondly whether there are any major downsides to using this type of structure for code for a large JS application  Im trying to work in an idiomatic JavaScript way and Im not too worried about keeping my local variables secret.p

The main variable for the object is json, and I used a main identifier internally within the object, i.e. projectData not sure if thats the right way about doing it. p  pWhat I am trying to do is pull in specific fields from the JSON Object. Id like to do this via a jQuery click event which adds a class to the clicked element, then for that element with the clicked class name, iterate over the JSON object and pull the data I need individually.p  pSo far Ive only been able to pull in all the fields for each object on click. How can I write my if statement to correct thisp  pHeres my codep  precode CLICK EVENT FOR ELEMENT   .element.on  click function                this.addClassclicked          .eachjson, function key, data               console.logkey                  if this.hasClass clicked                        .eachdata, function index, data                           console.logindex, data.projectName                                                                                       codepre  pThe above snippet will console all 40 element projectNames. Uncommenting the if statement breaks the scene this is built using threejs and the CSS3Renderer.p  pEssentially on an element click, Id like a modal to drop down with the clicked elements relevant JSON data. Ive been able to create all the objects within my scene using JavaScripts for loop. Im using jQuery to handle the hover event and click though. Chaining is simple enough to pull off.p  pAny help or guidance on this would be solid.p  pEDIT Ozans answer worked beautifully. As per his request, I am updating this question with the original JS for loop I used in creating the elements.

Negative 2443 pI realize there are many similar questions, but none have helped me along on this.p  pIm using a CRUD framework called Tynamo, which in turn relies on Apache Tapestry and Hibernate.  This all works fine, except for when I try to use it for CRUD on a table with a compositecompound primary key.p  pIve decided not to go the codeEmbeddedIdcode route, since it seems to not work at all with the framework.  That being said, I have been using the codeIdClasscode method, which is mostly working I think Im a line or two of code away from success.p  pThe issue is that when it starts using reflection to build the objects, it blows up and says, codeorg.hibernate.InstantiationException No default constructor for entity ...code, even though there is, indeed, a public, empty constructor for that inner class.p

Negative 2443 pI am developing a web application, which has spring for its server components, and angular js as its UI component. p  pI have 2 source folders a ui folder where I store HTML files, CSS, and js scripts, which I created using yeoman. I also have a spring folder where I keep all my java source codes. p  pI run grunt serve, that runs the UI components under localhost9000. To let the UI components to talk to the server, I run my javacodes on localhost8080.p  pThat works fine for me until, I open a page that uses a hashbang URL. That page can be accessed from localhost9090saveProfile. That page opens fine, however, when I refreshed that page, the URL in the browser become localhost9090saveProfile. And that resulted in a blank white page on my browser. That is because the server that I ran in localhost9090 does not know that saveProfile is not the real URL. p  pI could Bundle the js and HTML as part of the spring app, and run it under localhost8080. That way I can configure spring to handle saveProfile.p  pIs that the best way to solve this problem  Are there any other alternative  Because Ideally I would like to be able to run the UI components outside the spring application.p

Negative 2443 pWe are a small dev team that has inherited a decent sized ASP.NET MVC project started a few years ago with ASP.NET 4.  We are looking to migrate to ASP.NET 5 at some point.  Currently the solution has 3 projects  Data, Services, Web.  The data project uses the Entity Framework.  The Web project previously was just MVC but now houses a Web API where we have a couple hundred RESTful API calls and an AngularJS frontend.p  pIt looks like the ASP.NET 5 default solutions for web applications uses a new structure with the web project containing wwwroot and other things.  Would you recommend having multiple projects or should we keep the data and services in the main project  Im leaning towards the single project approach, but Im unsure what the best long term structure would be.

Negative 2443 pIm trying to utilize the Loggly appender utility for log4net. br Ive found that their code is enumerating through the codeThreadContextcode properties and appending them to the payload getting sent over the wire to the loggly service.

Negative 2443 pIn Win CE 6.0, class TankObject is defined in a static library, C compiler is VS2008 target is ARM4 QRarch4.p  pAn instance of class TankObject is constructed by a call of the formp  pTankObject myTankObject  new TankObjectparm1, parm2 ...p  pLast attribute declared in TankObject definition is an object pointer, and when an assignment is made to same, memory corruption of another dynamically allocated object occurs.p  pStep into constructor reveals that operator new is called with a size of 0x500.   sizeofTankObject reveals two different values, depending on the contextp  pIn instantiating context the application, sizeofTankObject and sizeofmyTankObject is 0x500. In context of the object itself the constructor, or object methods, sizeofTankObject and sizeofthis is 0x508.  The address of last declared attribute is 0x500, relative to object.p  pThe call to new requests and receives 0x500 bytes.   The object itself expects and uses 0x508 bytes, which can cause assignments to last attribute to step on other dynamically allocated objects.p  pWork around is to declare another unused attribute at the end of the object definition, to pad the request to new.p  pBoth contexts include the same .h file, to debug I changed include statement to an explicit path name.  I also went through compiler switches, made them identical.   So I am puzzled, if any one can shed light, Im glad, I would like to know a proper solution.p

This process continues and the user can carry on with their work until he closes the window.p  pCan you tell me how I can , via my Java code, extend the session like this I am interested in the server side code which I need to write. An example of the above scenario would be great to have. p  pThanks in advance for your help.p  pEnvironment Websphere Portal 8.x , JDK 1.7p
Negative 2443 pI am trying to understand a knapsack algorithm given to me in class, specifically the following pseudocode.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comShwPc.png altenter image description herep  pThis was my attempt to code itp  precodeInit array var solution  [] var items  problem.items var sackSize  problem.knapsack  solution[0]  0 forvar k  1 k lt sackSize k      var loot  0     forvar i  1 i lt items.length i              ifk gt items[i].weight                      loot  Math.maxloot, items[i].value                   solution[k]  loot  codepre  pThis doesnt make sense to me because codeifk gt items[i].weightcode always gives an index out of bounds error on the last iteration of the loop.

Why are we starting at index 1 Am I misinterpreting the variablesp  pI am givenp  blockquote   pThe object problem includes the maximum weight of the knapsack   problem.knapsack and an array of available items problem.items.   Each item is an object with a weight and value attribute   problem.items[i].weight and problem.items[i].value. Both of these   functions should return an array of selected items. The items in the   returned array should also have weight and value attributes.p blockquote

Negative 2443 pI was learning how to implement binary search on an array of objects of a userdefined class.

When doing binary search, say line 27 in the program,p  precodeCollections.binarySearchl, new User20, null, c codepre  pFrom what I understood, I guess that it is searching for such an codeUsercode object, in the ArrayList codelcode sorted using Comparator codeccode, which contains 20. codenullcode is passed in place of as codeString namecode argument.p  pTo further improve on this program, what changes could be made to search for an codeUsercode object which contains A in its codenamecode variable And search for it based only on codenamecode, assume that we have no knowledge of its codeidcode.p  pEdit I have given a link to a similar question, and I am not asking for the same logic. I am asking for an improvement on that question.p  pAnd to clear some confusion, in the linked questionp  precodeCollections.binarySearchl, new User20, null, c codepre  pis used so that an object with codeidcode 20 is searched with no idea of codenamecode because null is passed. I am trying to understand viceversa. Searching for an object using its codenamecode and no idea of codeidcode, something like doingp  precodeCollections.binarySearchl, new Usernull, A, c codepre

Negative 2443 pThere is a related post about this topic a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7603016efcodefirstcomplextypewithanavigationalpropertyherea.

One option would be to move the Place navigation properties to WorkSummary view models, like Place FoodPlace or Place AccomodationPlace. The easiest solution is to make Expense a nonComplexType entity, but then I should have also a WorkSummaryId on it, so it becomes a onetoone relationship, right Which is the most correct way of handling this My best bet is the onetoone relationship, but I liked the idea of using ComplexTypes on this one I am already using them for Address type.p

Negative 2443 pThis will seem like an already answered question, but I promise it is not...at least not answered.p  pWorking with Google Apps for Business. Have a specific need to write an httpsREST client  not using JAVAPYTHON or compiled code such as .NET. Going through the Google Data API documentation was straightforward until I tried to query information for any user other than the admin. All needed scopes have been authorized at the domain level Manage API access...etc. Each time I try to query the data for another user, I get the message that you cant access data for another user. strongI know this sounds familiar...but please read on.strong There are specific constructs for creating the CLAIM Set in JAVA, Python, and .NET to allow impersonation. However, there does not appear to be a corresponding one for straight HTTPSREST calls.p  pIve tried working with both sub and prn when creating the CLAIM set. Ive tried various combinations of the admin user and the user to be impersonated wo success. Im fairly certain at this point that there is a missing construct to be used in the creation of the CLAIM set for a straight HTTPSREST call. p  pIt is the FLUX Capacitor that I seek. p  pIn JAVA, it appears to be strongsetServiceAccountUserstrong. Other Google examples use similar constructs but there appears to be nothing documented [that works] for HTTPSREST calls. This is odd as it appears that every other GData function wouldwill work to administratively access user data.p  pHas anyone successfully accessed nonadmin google apps for business user data using just httpsrest calls not using the libraries for the specific languages There are several hundred users for which the internal app must provide services. The authorize per user route isnt a go...which is why we chose the delegated access at the domain level.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated....even if it is confirmation that what we are seeking is not possible.p  pTIA...p

Negative 2443 pIm new to android programming and every single somewhatsimilar question is from three or so years ago and doesnt really answer my question. Android Studio used to have different drawable folders for different dpi. Now there is only one. So if I have two images with the same name but for different dpi, where do I add them so that during runtime the phone can use the appropriate image p  pAlso, most android phones now are xhdpi or xxhdpido I really need to include any images less than that And how exactly would I do that Say, for example, that I get an image off shutterstock.

Negative 2443 pI want to add a filter on my codeListViewcode.p  pI already know how to do it by making the adapter implement codeFilterablecode, but I got some questions about it.p  p1 The examples Ive seen always iterate through the entire list of items, checking for each one if it needs to filter and are returning the items. Then getView instantiate only the returned items. Is there a way to not iterate through all the list twice once for filtering and once for item instantiating, but do everything once maybe something like checking the filter condition in the codegetViewcode method and then decide if the item should be created or notp  p2 After I filter the items, I override the original list with the filtered one. Does it mean I need to keep a copy of the list and always switch between the original and the copy after Im changing the filter query which can be changed on every key pressedp

So how my bolt database updater bolt interact with MySQL if it is located in other nodes... The reason I am giving these question is that I have a topology as described above, and it is running perfectly and updating MySQL table in strongLocal Modestrong but when I submitted it to the strongReal Cluster Distributed Modestrong with four supervisors I can see no update in MySQL table, but the topology is running without throwing no exceptions like network error or others, I also checked log files, no exceptions just info and some warn messages.

Negative 2443 pI am having difficulties setting slicer in excel.p  pI have multiple pivot tables PT in one workbook, which are connected to one slicer. Some PT have 2 and some 3 filters set. When I add a new connection to the slicer or, e.g. change the name of the slicer, some filters reset in all pivot tables. Since I have to reset them every time that happens, it totally misses the purpose of the slicer.p  pHere are some print screens to explain it better.p  pThe slicer sets the number of months O. In the working PT you can see filter set for field MD, O which is in the slicer and Row Labels. When I change something in the Slicer the PT changes the filter for Row Labels, and it doesnt work. As you can see on the 2nd PT print screen, the PT doesnt show any values, however other filters are fine. I always have to clear the filter for Row Labels and then choose needed values again. Is there any way to solve this problem and use slicer for this purposep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com2fde0.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2fde0.png altSlicerap  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comZ6Aa1.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZ6Aa1.png altWorking Pivot Tableap  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comlcNda.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlcNda.png altPivot Table after the change in slicerap  pI will be very grateful for help, since I cant find a solution to this problem.p  pThank you for your helpp
