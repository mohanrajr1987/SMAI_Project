Positive 364 pI have a restful service written in Java using the Jersey Framework that implements an Advanced Message Queuing Protocol on top of a RabbitMQ server. p  pWhen a consumer gets a message from a given channel he is given a delivery tag. This delivery tag is used in a separate rest call to acknowledge receipt of the message and remove it from the queue entirely. However, since each channel has its own set of delivery tags starting with tag id 1, the acknowledgement request must know which channel to send the acknowledgement back to, otherwise we get an unknown delivery tag exception.p  pOne way I have thought of tracking this is by using some kind of dictionary that stores a generated GUID as the key and stores the channel and delivery tag id as the value. I could pass the GUID to the consumer on a consume call, store the GUID with its associated channel and delivery tag in the dictionary, and then when the ack call comes back with the GUID, I could then look up the proper channel and delivery tag and ack it. p  pThere is one problem with this method though, the restful java application that is running on top of the single running RabbitMQ server must run in a load balanced environment, which means a consume request could come in and hit one running instance of the application and store the channeldelivery tag in its local dictionary. Then when it calls to ack that message it could hit another running instance of the application, which would have a different set of GUIDs in its local dictionary and thus would not be able to look up the necessary channeldelivery tag needed to ack. p  pOf course I could store the channeldelivery tag info in an external database, but that would kind of defeat the purpose of using a queue in the first place.p  pHow would you have a restful RabbitMQ service that requires acknowledging messages, can be load balanced, and has one channel per thread, if you have to send the acknowledgment on the same channel you consumed fromp

So without the parameter method. p  pCan someone give me a hint I have to create a file for each REST API It is the first time that make REST API in php.p  pThanks a lot.p
Positive 364 pIm developing a AngularJS driven SPA. I want to show a fullscreen overlay saying something like Sorry  Server is not available atm as soon as the connection between client and server is interrupted. p  pSo I wrote a simple codewhiletruecode loop which is basically just calling codeapipingcode which always returns codetruecode. When there is no http response tho, then the message shall appear.p  pI dont like this approach since it creates a lot of overhead. Especially considering mobile connections.p  pSo what would be a decent solution for my case I could imagine work with a websocket and an codeonInterruptedcode or similar event.p

Positive 364 pif i am correct HATEOAS ist an architectural pattern and dont describe HOW a client should discover relations. HATEOAS just describe THAT a server should send a discoverable API to the client.p  pWhen adopting HATEOAS the api author can define HOW the client has to discover the relations.p  pFor example without a standard like hydra  hal  jsonapi its not clear if a json use link, link, links, relations fields in the json document to represent a relation.p  pFrom my point of view, this would allow me, as an api author to define something like this valid HATEOASp  pThe symbol  represents an array of hypermedia controlsp  pHypermedia controls are represented by a string.p  pThe string can start with the reserved symbols ,  and .p  pIf the hypermedia string starts with , the client is allowed to do a safe GET request to the URL. the URL follows the  symbol and is rot13 decoded.p  precode           [        uggc...traerfsnagnfl     ]  codepre  pFrom my point of view, this should be valid HATEOAS, or did i miss somethingp  pOf course defining an own standard ontop of HATEOAS doesnt make sense.p

Positive 364 pWhat would be an appropriate REST compatible approach that would allow a client to call a RESTful service in order to convert a large document to a target format p  pI was thinking about something similar to this p  ol liClient makes a codePOSTcode on codeconversionrequestcode resource with conversion configuration target type, secure key, notification resource URL in the form a hrefhttphosttobenotifiednotificationstatusid relnofollowhttphosttobenotifiednotificationstatusida that will return a request id. The conversion request would be added to an internal queue and can be modified  deleted by the client as long as the conversion is not started.li liOnce conversion is started the codeconversionrequestidcode is deleted by the serverli liOnce conversion is done the server creates a codeconversionresultidcode same id as above in 1 resource then does a PUT on the notification status resource to set it to ready and providing the key which will inform the client of the completion of its request li liWhen ready the client makes a codeGETcode on codeconversionresultidcode resource to obtain the converted documentli liIf the client went offline for any reason, he can try to retrieve the result as in 4. If the document is not ready, the client just has to wait for the notification to be sent.li ol  pHowever...p  ol liIs it a valid approach li lishould I forget about using REST and should I rather think about using SOAP and have a blocking call, knowing that I would prefer avoiding blocking calls or JMS all approaches have their proscons, and one big cons against JMS in my context is that it would require the setup of queues for all clients which may be refused note thats why I also added SOAP and JMS tags to this questionli liAny idea of how to improve the approach and what are the questions I should think about before going any further li ol  pThanks in advance for your help p  pMichelp

Positive 364 pWe have exposed soap based web services and in order to develop our mobile application, we need to consume those soap webservices and expose theme as restful webservice. Can any one give me a hint  the best method to process this requirement  Thanks in advance.p
Positive 364 pemThis question is language independent. Lets not worry about frameworks or implementation, lets just say everything can be implemented and lets look at REST API in an abstract way. In other words Im building a framework right now and I didnt see any solution to this problem anywhere.emp  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow one can construct REST URL endpoint for intersection of two independent REST paths which return collections Short example How to intersect codeusers1commentscode and codecompanies6commentscodep  pstrongConstraintstrongp  pAll endpoints should return single data model entity or collection of entities.p  pImho this is a very reasonable constraint and all examples of Hypermedia APIs look like this, even in a hrefhttpstools.ietf.orghtmldraftkellyjsonhal07 relnofollowdraftkellyjsonhal07a.p  pIf you think this is an invalid constraint or you know a better way please let me know.p  pstrongExamplestrongp  pSo lets say we have an application which has three data types codeproductscode, codecategoriescode and codecompaniescode. Each company can add some products to their profile page. While adding the product they must attach a category to the product. For example we can access this kind of data like thisp  ul licodeGET categoriescode will return collection of all categoriesli licodeGET categories9code will return category of id 9li licodeGET categories9productscode will return all products inside category of id 9li licodeGET companies7productscode will return all products added to profile page of company of id 7li ul  pemIve omitted codelinkscode hypermedia part on purpose because it is straightforward, for example codecode gives codelinkscode to codecategoriescode and codecompaniescode etc. We just need to remember that by using hypermedia we are traversing relations graph.emp  pHow to write URL that will return all products that are from company7 and are of category9 In otherwords how to intersect codecategories9productscode and codecompanies7productscodep  pAssuming that all endpoints should represent data model resource or collection of them I believe this is a fundamental problem of REST Hypermedia API, because in traversing hypermedia api we are traversing relational graph going down one path so it is impossible to describe such intersection because it is a crosssection of two independent graph paths.p  pIn other words I think we cannot represent two independent paths with only one path. Normally we traverse one path like codeAgtBgtCcode, but if we have codeXgtYcode and codeZgtYcode and we want all codeYcodes that come from codeXcode and codeZcode then we have a problem.p  pSo far my proposition is to use query strings codecategories9productsintersectcompanies9code but can we do betterp  pstrongWhy do I want thisstrongp  pBecause Im building a framework which will autogenerate REST Hypermedia API based on SQL database relations. You could think of it as a trans compiler of URLs to codeSELECT ... JOIN ... WHEREcode queries, but the client of the API only sees Hypermedia and the client would like to have a nice way of doing intersections, like in the example.p

Positive 364 pI would like to create an app that talks to the users computer so Id like to create a server with a REST API. What is the best way to go about doing this I looked into WCF but that seems overkill and most tutorials I see seems its more suitable to a server backend than being installed on a user computer. p  pAre there other more suitable frameworks in C that I can use to create a REST API on all user machines as opposed to using socketsp  pThanksp  pEdit Apologies for the lack of clarity. I would like to develop an app on iOS and Android that talks to the users machine. In order to do this, I need a server on the users machine that will perform the actions that I request from the mobile device. I want to avoid using sockets as a REST API will suffice and makes development easier. I believe WCF can achieve this but might be overkill for a simple app that talks to a users machine. Web API seeems like something that would be the solution but happy to hear if Im taking a wrong approach to this.p
Positive 364 pIm new to Azure App Services and Im not getting the point about Azure API Apps access control. As I understood, the API Apps services has built in features to enable authentication on the API using Azure ActiveDirectory or thirdparty services.p  pIn my case, Im studying to use this with ASP.NET 5 REStful services capabilities. In that way, Ill usually need to authorize or not the access to some endpoint based on the claims a user might have, because in order to authorize or not something is a matter of business rules instead of a simple allowdeny based on login.p  pAs I understood, Azure will just take care of authentication, it will redirect the client to the identity provider, will get the token and generate another token which will allow access to the API. But, how this connects with my app Is it possible, working that way, to deal with claims for users If so, how is this donep  pIm a little in doubt, because Im failing to see how this really connects with my app, in the sense of allowing me to do what Im already used to do.p

Negative 364 pI have something unclear concerning casting reference variable in Java.p  pI have two classes A and B. A is the super class of B.  If I have the two objects, and then the print statementp  precodeA a  new A superclass  B b  new B subclass  System.out.println Ab codepre  pthen what exactly is happening when the println method is executedp  pI know that because B is a subclass of A, I am allowed to make the following castp  precodeA a2  Ab codepre  pI also know that when println takes a reference variable as argument, then the toString method of the class, which has created the objectargument, is invoked implicitly. This is so, because the method println is looking for an argument of type String, and the toString method represent the object as a string. And even if we dont write toString, the method is invoked  implicitly. So, the following two statements are equivalentp  precodeSystem.out.println b  System.out.println b.toString codepre  pSo, my question is what is the implicit action taken when we have p  precodeSystem.out.println Ab codepre  p p  pI suppose that the type of the reference variable b is automatically changed from B to A. The variable should still be pointing to the same object  the one created with p  precodeB b  new B codepre  pbut just the type of b would be now changed. Is this correct  Another question even though I have changed the type of b to the type of the superclass, are the overriden methods in the subclass going to be called, and not those of the superclass p  pThanks a lot.p  pRegardsp

I am however going to go about integrating RabbitMQ with Workling into the app I am building, then if I ever need some knowledge about a fast queue then I will have this and know whether or not it fits my needs.p  pEDIT Finding more and more that DJ suits me just fine, if I ever outgrow it on a site Id say that Resque is where I would head.p  pEDIT Dec 2014 So its been a long time since I asked this, but I see it still gets some views or some votes, so I figured Id update it on my approach now when it comes to my choice of background workers.p  pIn my opinion currently the best way to run background jobs in Ruby is using Sidekiq. A lot of people have really lauded Sidekiq for its threaded workers rather than process per worker which can use significantly less memory than the likes of Resque, which I was using before Sidekiq. This is good but for me this wasnt the killer feature. By using Sidetiq with Sidekiq, the scheduling of jobs is so trivial that I switched over and have never looked back from it, by far the easiest scheduling of jobs that I have used and has made Sidekiq a breeze to use.p

Negative 364 pin the data warehouse theres a default language for the measures, and I added a translation for German captions. In a Visual Studio Report Server project, when creating a query with my German OS, the cube and its measures are displayed in German language.

Negative 364 pI have about 4 days to load 4 million rows of data, where the stored procedures appear to take about 500msrow, so I am suggesting we temporarily repurpose two computers, one as the SQL Server and one to feed it.  Each machine is a 4 cpu, 2 corecpu computer with tons of memory.p  pThere are two competing ideas on how to load the data.p  ol lion the import computer maintain using a VM, which limits me to 4 cores of use.li liditch the VM for the load and use all 8 cores for loading.li ol  pThe database will be on the actual computer, no VM.p  pI will get one shot at showing that using the VM will considerably impact performance, but that is just a gut feeling. I need to prove it, so I am going to suggest we do a test load with a smaller dataset, so rather than loading about 12G data we will do perhaps only 6G, and get numbers.p  pBut, since I have one shot at this, I want to get a reasonable guess at how many threads can be used in both environments.p  pMy guess is 4 threadscore, since database transactions involve a great deal of waiting time for threads, but I dont know if that would be too many threads on the VM.  I am not certain how to determine what is a reasonable number of threads to suggest.p  pThe limiting factor may not be the computer that has the program that loads the data, it may be the database computer will actually be the limiting factor, and 32 concurrent database connections may be too much for an 8 core machine.p  pSo, is my guess of 4 threads per core reasonable in both environmentsp  pThe OS on the computers is Windows Server 2008 R2 and the VM would be using HyperV.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIn case it matters, I am using .NET 4, using the parallel framework, so I adjust the number of concurrent threads by changing it in my configuration file, so I use PLINQ heavily.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pI had an idea today to speed things up, where we will use one 4 core VM to benchmark but the SQL Server will use a 24G virtual drive ram drive, since the computer has 48G RAM, and the database will be completely in memory.  This way I should be able to feed it with several threads as fast as the feeder program can.  If that isnt fast enough then we will use all 12 cores to feed it, but they expect it wont be needed.  So, I should be able to hopefully load all the data in 1 day instead of a bit over a month, but, once I get some benchmarks I will let everyone know.  I may see about using a smaller desktop to feed it to see if there is a penalty by using a VM, but there will only be one VM on this box, so 8 cores will be unused.  The OS on the HyperV box is Windows Core, btw.p

Negative 364 pI have a weird situation that has been puzzling me for weeks. My project, a hrefhttpgithub.commikemac11Textual relnofollowTextuala, is an IRC client for Mac OS X. It works great except one problem. DCC SEND messages via the DCC protocol do not work properly. For some reason the first section of the IP address sent for which connections will be established is always cut off. For example, the correct message sent would be DCC SEND file.png 72.218.77.160 1097 4699 but once sent is viewed as DCC SEND file.png .218.77.160 1097 4699p  pI have isolated this to the Unicode character 0x01 which is sent along side the message to distinguish it from a standard message. If this character is removed then no stripping occurs.  I simply cannot figure out why it does this. It could be a result of sockets or not. Not my strong area on that one. If anyone has time to help it would be appreciated. p

Negative 364 pWe noticed one interesting issue regarding memory management in VB that we do not understand.

Negative 364 pIm working at a SaaS, where any tenant can have several lists of contacts, each list can have any number of custom fields contacts of this list can store and any number of groups the contancts of the list can be includes groups are used for segmenting contacts of the list. Each contact has one required fields emailaddress and any number of userdefined fields that are defined for the list where it is as I mentioned about. We must be able to find contacts of the lists base on the groups theyre in and the values of user defined values. We must provise up to 30 user defined fields. I see now three ways of solving this problemp  ol lipUsing kind of EAV we try to do it like this but it looks rather   complex. We have a table lists  lists of tenants, a related tables customfields, a related tables   subscribers that stored   emailaddreses of   subscribers of the  list, table subscriberscustomdata   which is related with subscribers and customfields tables stored values of the custom fields of the subscribers.pli lipField tables pattern. The descriptions of it is here a hrefhttpblog.springsource.comarjenarchives20080124storingcustomfieldsinthedatabasehttpblog.springsource.comarjenarchives20080124storingcustomfieldsinthedatabasea. In thise case wed use a field related to custom fields, that would store in columns all custom fields for example have 30 columns to store values of each possible custom fields and a table that stored mapping of columns name and name of the user defined field. It looks complex too. Wed have to have at least 30 indexes at least to search by the values of custom fields, there other problems too,pli lipTo use some sort of NoSQL database at least for storing of user defined fields and maybe groups of the list.  Do you think such databases can help here and if so how to design for storing custom fields and groups. I try to look at different types NoSQL, for example, document oriented like MongoDb, but right away I cant see how it can help solve this problem. We can store arbitrary attributes here but to search for the values of the custom fields we need to index them in advance so we have to know what custom fields well have.pli ol  pThank you for any information about it.p
Negative 364 pI have just been through one of my apps converting the authentication from authlogic to devise.  By and large this has been amazingly straightforward to do but there is one issue I cant find an easy fix for.p  pIn the app, the user has the option of choosing their locale.  Then whenever they login, they view the app in the language they choose.  Previously, I did this by simply setting the locale in the create method of my UserSessions controller.p  pWith Devise, all the controllers are automatically setup, which is great.  I know that I could create a custom Controller that extends the DeviseController and do it like this but, from what I understand, that means that I will also need to create all the views to go with it which seems a bit over the top when I just need to run one extra line of code.p  pIs there an easier way of specifying some code to be run on a successful devise authenticationp

Negative 364 pI have a number of XSD files that define the schema for some XML.

I know the specific typeclass this section should be deserialized as it is specified in the XML itself and isnt static  it can be any of a few different types. I was hoping that I could just call Deserialize in the XmlSerializer class, passing in this segment, but of course its not really valid XML on its own.p  pIs there an easy way I can load this segment into my classes without having to manually parse this stuff myself this segment represents another fairly complex set of XML so that would be really painful.p  pI have no control over the XSD files so I cant just change them.p

Negative 364 pIm pretty new, and Im making a basic multiview application in which buttons open new views.p  pEDIT I got the same problem when I made a new, simpler app, and I think it has to do with removing subviews. I made another simple version of the app, with two codeUIViewControllercodes codeMainViewControllercode and codeSecondViewControllercode. codeMainViewcode has a toolbar and a red background, codeSecondViewcode has a light blue background.

Both views have codeBOOL shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationcode written to only accept Landscape orientations.p  pHowever, when I run the application, rather than seeing the RootViews red background with buttons, the upper half of the screen is red, while the lower half is yellow with the buttons, as if the two codeUIViewscode are somehow getting mixed.

My guess is that the function in the first return statement is a function expression as its part of a statement. However, then I dont know how a closure, with reference to func and thisValue, is created.p  pIf it is a function expression, then when bind is called, the anonymous function wont be evaluated there and then and therefore wont have a function object set up with a [[scope]] property containing the scope of binds execution context. And so, the anonymous function wont have access to func and thisValue through its [[scope]] property.p  pSo if the code does indeed form a closure, then my guess is wrong and the function in the first return statement must be a function declaration. Or maybe Im misunderstanding when return is evaluated Any help on this would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 364 pI am really struggling with this and have been at it for quite some time.p  pI have a background image with a logo and I want a div in the center such that it doesnt block the BEE image in the background.

Negative 364 pIve not found any other resources on this issue, so I figured I would ask the SO community. p  pI currently have an issue with my CFB2 client going into a memory leak about three seconds after I edit a particular file on one of our company webservers. This also occurs when I try and edit a local copy of the file. The leak is slow and would take many many hours to hold up all of my free RAM 6.5GB8GB physical. There is also a high CPU usage on the leak anywhere from 2545  1.8 GHz fourcore. The only visual feedback I receive is in the Outline pane, where it extends infinitely into a loop of codecfelseifcode tags. The pane also holds the loop before editing, but does not attempt to extend it.p  pThis error first occurred whilst I was creating a codecffilecode tag and because I could not close it, the conditional statements were mishighlighted. I believe this is the root cause of the issue, however, I do not know why this occurred.p  pAs I complete typing of this, I will move the file to a simple editor, remove the line that caused the error, and attempt to add it again, however I fear that the addition of the line will end in the same manner.p  pEDIT I moved the page source into Notepad and removed the pesky codecffilecode line. Then, I proceeded to delete the file from the webserver, create a new file of the same name, and add the code back. I closed the tag before adding any attributes just to ensure the same issue would not occur, and it did not experience the same loop. p

Except the results are not as expected.p  pIf I dont collapse the second label so it is visible on the dialog all the time it prints as expected but when I hide the second the print doesnt have two copies of the label rather the elements of the second are overlaid over the first as shown below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcWUWZ.png altenter image description herep  pHere is the XAML that Im printingp  precodeltBorder xNamePrintRange BorderBrush00000000 BorderThickness20gt     ltStackPanel OrientationVerticalgt         ltBorder xNameFirstCopy BorderBrushBlack BorderThickness1 BackgroundWhite CornerRadius5gt             ltGrid Margin10gt                 ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                     ltRowDefinitiongt                     ltRowDefinitiongt                     ltRowDefinitiongt                     ltRowDefinitiongt                     ltRowDefinitiongt                 ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                     ltColumnDefinitiongt                     ltColumnDefinitiongt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                  ltImage SourceMiX.DLD.Web.UI.SilverlightcomponentImagesVdoLogo.png Width80 HorizontalAlignmentLeft                           VerticalAlignmentTop Grid.Row0 gt                 ltTextBlock TextDLD FontSize20 FontWeightBold HorizontalAlignmentRight VerticalAlignmentTop                                   Grid.Row0 Grid.Column1 gt                 ltTextBlock TextIMPORTANT NUMBERS FontSize14 FontWeightBold Margin0,5,0,5                                   Grid.Row1 Grid.Column0 Grid.ColumnSpan2 gt                 ltTextBlock TextIMEI NUMBER FontSize12 Grid.Row2 gt                 ltTextBlock TextBinding ImeiNumber,ModeOneWay FontSize12 FontWeightBold Margin10,0,0,0 Grid.Row2 Grid.Column1 gt                 ltTextBlock TextSERIAL NUMBER FontSize12 Grid.Row3 gt                 ltTextBlock TextBinding SerialNumber,ModeOneWay FontSize12 FontWeightBold Margin10,0,0,0 Grid.Row3 Grid.Column1 gt                 ltTextBlock TextREGISTRATION CODE FontSize12 Grid.Row4 gt                 ltTextBlock TextBinding RegistrationCode,ModeOneWay FontSize12 FontWeightBold Margin10,0,0,0 Grid.Row4 Grid.Column1 gt             ltGridgt         ltBordergt          ltBorder xNameSecondCopy BorderBrushBlack BorderThickness1 BackgroundWhite CornerRadius5                          VisibilityCollapsed Margin0,20,0,0gt             ltGrid Margin10gt                 ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                     ltRowDefinitiongt                     ltRowDefinitiongt                     ltRowDefinitiongt                     ltRowDefinitiongt                     ltRowDefinitiongt                 ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                     ltColumnDefinitiongt                     ltColumnDefinitiongt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                  ltImage SourceMiX.DLD.Web.UI.SilverlightcomponentImagesVdoLogo.png Width80 HorizontalAlignmentLeft                           VerticalAlignmentTop Grid.Row0 gt                 ltTextBlock TextDLD FontSize20 FontWeightBold HorizontalAlignmentRight VerticalAlignmentTop                                   Grid.Row0 Grid.Column1 gt                 ltTextBlock TextIMPORTANT NUMBERS FontSize14 FontWeightBold Margin0,5,0,5                                   Grid.Row1 Grid.Column0 Grid.ColumnSpan2 gt                 ltTextBlock TextIMEI NUMBER FontSize12 Grid.Row2 gt                 ltTextBlock TextBinding ImeiNumber,ModeOneWay FontSize12 FontWeightBold Margin10,0,0,0 Grid.Row2 Grid.Column1 gt                 ltTextBlock TextSERIAL NUMBER FontSize12 Grid.Row3 gt                 ltTextBlock TextBinding SerialNumber,ModeOneWay FontSize12 FontWeightBold Margin10,0,0,0 Grid.Row3 Grid.Column1 gt                 ltTextBlock TextREGISTRATION CODE FontSize12 Grid.Row4 gt                 ltTextBlock TextBinding RegistrationCode,ModeOneWay FontSize12 FontWeightBold Margin10,0,0,0 Grid.Row4 Grid.Column1 gt             ltGridgt         ltBordergt     ltStackPanelgt ltBordergt codepre  pand here is the method in which I do the printingp  precodeprivate void OnPrintButtonClickedobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e    var pd  new PrintDocument   pd.PrintPage  s, args gt                                            SecondCopy.Visibility  Visibility.Visible                       args.PageVisual  PrintRange                        pd.EndPrint  s, args gt  SecondCopy.Visibility  Visibility.Collapsed    pd.PrintMiX DLD preregistration label    this.DialogResult  true  codepre  pI can solve the problem by moving the setting of SecondCopy.Visibility out of the PrintPage event handler and placing it above the pd.Print call but this visibly updates the screen before the dialog closes and looks messy, so Id prefer not to do it this way.p  pAny suggestions on how I might resolve this problemp

Negative 364 pRevised  I have multiple class definitions spread across files one class per file.

Is there any way to achieve thisp  pThe codeextendscode keyword does not help me here at all the classes that codeMastercode creates instances of will inherit the properties and methods of codeMastercode, but any changes these instances make to the properties of codeMastercode are not saved in the codeMastercode object, just the object that made the changes. In other words, the changes arent visible in any other class.p  pI believe this is a limitation of not making things static so that there are no instances, but is there a way to get around all this using the codecall, setcode and codegetcode magic methodsp

Negative 364 pI have two lists displaying on a web page List of Clients List of Projectsp  pWhen the user changes his selection in the client list, I repopulate the Project list.  I make a jquery call to phpmysql to fetch the projects relating to this client and then I use this data to set the options for the client codeltselectgtcode.  Unfortunately changing the list contents for the project codeltselectgtcode element does not cause the display for this element to change like setting the codeinnerHTMLcode for a text element would.p  pI can force a page refresh and everything looks fine, but I would prefer not to have to refresh the page.  Is there a way to cause a codeltselectgtcode element to redrawp  pHere is a set of HTMLjavascript that has the problem.  At the bottom of function BuildProjectList it can be seen that I have tried populating the Project list in 2 ways, by setting innerHTML or by building the list of options.  In either case the display of the Project List does not update when I change its contents in response to a change of selection in the client list.  But if after this you change the selection in the project list, the display does update and you can verify that the underlying data for the Project list has in fact changed.p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gt ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1gt lttitlegtTest List ....lttitlegt ltlink relstylesheet hrefhttpcode.jquery.commobile1.0.1jquery.mobile1.0.1.min.css gt ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.6.4.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.commobile1.0.1jquery.mobile1.0.1.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt function BuildClientList      var uiEl  document.getElementByIduidCl     var aUidClient  new Array3      aUidClient[0]  [101, Client 1]     aUidClient[1]  [102, Client 2]     aUidClient[2]  [102, Client 3]      uiEl.options.length  0     var cClient  aUidClient.length     for iRow  0 iRow lt cClient iRow              uiEl.options[iRow]  new OptionaUidClient[iRow][1], aUidClient[iRow][0]        function BuildProjectList      iClient  document.getElementByIduidCl.selectedIndex     var uiEl  document.getElementByIduidPr     var aUidProject  new Array3     switch iClient              case 0         aUidProject[0]  [101, 1Project 1]         aUidProject[1]  [102, 1Project 2]         aUidProject[2]  [103, 1Project 3]         break         case 1         aUidProject[0]  [201, 2Project 1]         aUidProject[1]  [202, 2Project 2]         aUidProject[2]  [203, 2Project 3]         break         default         aUidProject[0]  [301, 3Project 1]         aUidProject[1]  [302, 3Project 2]         aUidProject[2]  [303, 3Project 3]            uiEl.options.length  0     var cProject  aUidProject.length     var strInner       for iRow  0 iRow lt cProject iRow              uiEl.options[iRow]  new OptionaUidProject[iRow][1], aUidProject[iRow][0]         strInner  ltoption value  aUidProject[iRow][0]  gt               aUidProject[iRow][1]  ltoptiongt        uiEl.innerHTML  strInner   ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv datarolefieldcontaingt ltinput typehidden ididuserinfo nameiduserinfo value1 gt    ltlabel forsclient classselect uihiddenaccessiblegtClient...ltlabelgt    ltselect dataoverlaythemea datanativemenufalse nameuidCl iduidCl onChangeBuildProjectListgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt BuildClientList ltscriptgt ltselectgt   ltdivgtltdiv datarolefieldcontaingt ltinput typehidden ididproj nameidproj value2 gt    ltlabel forsproj classselect uihiddenaccessiblegtProject...ltlabelgt    ltselect dataoverlaythemea datanativemenufalse nameuidPr iduidPr gt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt BuildProjectList ltscriptgt ltselectgt ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 364 pI have a simple app with a User model and an authentication system built from scratch. I am now trying to use Devise instead, and it does not work and, as a newbie in web development, there is something I dont grasp and I dont know how to debug this. p  pMy problem is Devise is installed and works, except that signin always return invalid email or password even if both fields are correct.p  pI have developed an empty app, added Devise, and I dont have this problem. The problem thus probably comes because I try to add Devise to an existing User model. p  pI have read the doc and the Devise wiki, which has a topic on this subject a hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevisewikiHowTo3achangeanalreadyexistingtabletoadddeviserequiredcolumnsherea.  says to remove databaseauthenticatable from the migration fields, because the User model has already a email field, and replace it with t.encryptedpassword, which I did in the migration.p  pNow, in my user model, I left databaseauthenticatable in the attraccessible. If I remove it, I have a lot of error messages that sessionpath is not recognized, etc ... but it has not been migrated  Also, encryptedpassword does not appear anywhere in my model, is this normal ...p  pI know it is really a newbie question, Im a bit lost and dont know if I should rewrite my app from the start or if theres an easy fix...I dont know how to debug also, all I see in the logs is that unauthorized appears when user should be signing in successfully, and also that authenticationtoken is not the same when trying to signin that the one generated once signed upp  pso, Im lost, if it seems obvious to you, Id be glad to hear any advice ... p  pI add below the routes.rb, User.rb, schema.rb and migration filep  proutes.rbp  precodeTapaGApplication.routes.draw do    devisefor users    get pageshome    resources users   resources belongings    devisescope user do     get signin, to gt devisesessionsnew     get signout, to gt devisesessionsdestroy     get signup, to gt deviseregistrationsnew   end    get pagesmoredetails   get pagesinfospratiques   get pagescontactus    match Profil, to gt usersProfil   match moredetails, to gt pagesmoredetails   match contactus, to gt pagescontactus   match infospratiques, to gt pagesinfospratiques   match belongingsnew, to gt belongingsnew   root to gt pageshome codepre  pmigrationp  precodeclass AddDeviseToUsers lt ActiveRecordMigration   def self.up     changetableusers do t       t.recoverable       t.rememberable       t.trackable       t.encryptedpassword null gt false, default gt , limit gt 128         t.encryptable        t.confirmable        t.lockable lockstrategy gt failedattempts, unlockstrategy gt both        t.tokenauthenticatable          Uncomment below if timestamps were not included in your original model.        t.timestamps     end      addindex users, email,                unique gt true     addindex users, resetpasswordtoken, unique gt true      addindex users, confirmationtoken,   unique gt true      addindex users, unlocktoken,         unique gt true      addindex users, authenticationtoken, unique gt true   end    def self.down      By default, we dont want to make any assumption about how to roll back a migration when your      model already existed.

Were essentially looking for a db thats really fast and powerful, but still pretty simple to use, especially since well be accessing it from ObjectiveC, which is still pretty new for us.  Is Sqlite what were looking for  A colleague of ours suggested using PostGres, but isnt PostGres pretty datedp

Negative 364 pI coded up this program which will take an infix notation expression and build a binary tree from it. Right now the only input expression that actually works would be like 2  2. I cant seem to figure out at all how to make it handle parenthesis and take in longer expressions such as   2  2   3 . For my output I am trying to get it into postfix notation and also evaluate the expression. So right now if I plug in 2  2 without the parenthesis my output is 22 and it evaluates it so it prints 4.p  pI need to figure out a way for it to print out the output with spaces in between each number and operator and also get it to accept longer expressions with parenthesis. I have no idea right now how to continue from here.

Negative 364 pIn my WPF application, I am using the codeViewModelLocatorcode without IoC.  I am calling the static codeViewModelLocator.Cleanupcode method provided by the MVVMLight framework from my own button which is tied to a close window command.  This Command calls the static codeViewModelLocator.Cleanupcode, which calls an instance Cleanup method on my MainWindowViewModel instance.  The instance Cleanup method then sets the property to which the MainWindow binds its codeDataContextcode, to null.  The setter on the property raises a codePropertyChangedcode event.  Curiously, setting this property to null does not cause the window to close.p  pI am trying to understand why this is the case  If I set the MainWindows codeDataContextcode to null, should that not be the same as codeWindow.Closecode  In my case, the Window and all of its elements remain on the screen.  However, if I attempt further actions, I get null pointer exceptions, indicating the codeDataContextcode binding Property has indeed been set to null  this has also been confirmed in the debugger.p  pI have created a workaround by hooking the Application.Exit event and issuing a Window.Close in the event handler in order to create my own Close Window button ie, to create same functionality for my own Button  Command as clicking the X button in the upper right of a Window.  Since calling a UI element ie, the Window instance from MVVM directly is not MVVM friendly, I used a a hrefhttpblog.synctank.com20111203viewservicepresent relnofollowViewServicea to implement the Window.Close functionality in order to keep the workaround MVVM friendly.  I am a big fan of the ViewService idiom or pattern, but I just dont think it should be necessary here except, I could see how exiting the app is a special case that perhaps should tiein with the application lifecycle, and .Net seems to only allow exiting a WPF app by issuing the Window.Close method.p  pThoughts appreciated.p

Negative 364 pIm new to WCF and need some assistance with architecture for the following solutionp  pI want to create a WCF Service that hosts a FileSystemWatcher. This service must watch a series of folders on the machine and when a file is placed in a folder or is renamed I need this WCF service to Publish an event.p  pAnother WCF service must then Subscribe to this event and do some processing.p  pThe basic idea is that there is one service to monitor a predetermined set of directories, whilst an appropriate service gets notified that there are files available for processing.p  pSo my questions are  1. Regarding the FileSystemWatcher WCF Service, I want to host it in AppFabric but am not sure exactly how this is going to work. I.E. When this service is deployed to the server I want the appropriate FileSystemWatcher object to be called and stay on and monitor folders indefinately. Can WCF do this in this manner or is this a better candidate for a Windows Service 2. Can one WCF service publish events and another WCF service subscribe to these events and how All WCF services hosted inside AppFabricp

The web test is not part of a load test.p  pIn these conditions, the test is run 5 times, for each row, so it basically moves the cursor automatically. Is this intendedp  pNow, on to the practical question, which is the subject of this post.p  pMy StepList table above has, among others, an identity column and a StepId column. The web test in question is actually called from another web test, and its supposed to run only for the table rows that have a StepId set in the test context.p  precodeId  StepId 1   1 2   1 3   2 4   2 5   2 codepre  pIn order to achieve this, I followed the guidelines from a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combslumleyarchive20100104vsts2010featuredatasourceenhancements.aspx relnofollowherea and wrote a web test plugin with the PreWebTest method looking like thisp  precodepublic override void PreWebTestobject sender, PreWebTestEventArgs e      string stepId  string.Empty      if e.WebTest.Context.ContainsKeyContextParameterName              stepId  e.WebTest.Context[ContextParameterName].ToString           while e.WebTest.Context[DS.StepList.StepId].ToString  stepId              e.WebTest.MoveDataTableCursorDS, StepList       codepre  pThe code above seems to work properly on the example table only if the stepId has the value 2. If its 1, then MoveDataTableCursor throws WebTestEndOfDataException exception No more rows of data in a data source table with AccessMethod Unique.p  pI tried catching the exception and stopping the web test, but this doesnt work, as the test seems to never end.p  pWhat is the proper way to deal with this p  pThank you.p

Negative 364 pI have noticed that while debugging my site, any request that results in a 404 and appears to refer to a path on the disk relative to my configured virtual directory is intercepted by Cassini and rudely replaced with a directory listing. Im using Nancy Framework, but given that this problem appears to be at the web server level, I suspect Cassini would act the same way for MCV applications. I cant find any documentation on this feature other than a related commit message on the Cassini source that says ...directory listing only overrides 404 responses for directories.p  pI would much rather my development web server stop trying to outsmart my framework. I makes the debugging experience more than a little jarring. In an MVC framework the request URLs have nothing at all to do with file locations, so the fact Im getting directory listings for some invalid requests and the correct 404 page for others gets annoying. Not to mention its making several of my unit tests fail because they rely on autogenerated content in my 404 error pages which I cant manually test either.p  pIs there any way to disable this functionality in Cassini I know I could install IIS Express, but Id rather not.

Negative 364 pI am trying to setup a share button for facebook, twitter, and the other major share sites. The thing is when I use the methods I have found they only let me manually add the url to the share, not the text or title. This is an issue because on my site the share buttons would be on some posts, the main page showing 10 at a time, with a quotes page showing one and the comments. These posts are gotten from the database via a php function, returned to the index and it shows them. Then index takes care of what type to show. p  pThe issue here is the share button looks at index.php for the title and text, both of which are dynamically added. So it find the wrong data. Is there anyway to manually tell it what text and title to use If not then any advice on what to redesign to make it workp  pSite url a hrefhttpohmsgaming.comnstdtindex.php relnofollowhttpohmsgaming.comnstdtindex.phpap

Negative 364 pI have two dllexported classes A and B. As declaration contains a function which uses a stdvector in its signature likep  precodeclass EXPORT A   ...  stdvectorltBgt myFunctionstdvectorltBgt const ampinput  codepre  pEXPORT is the usual macro to put in place emdeclspecdllexportemdeclspecdllimport accordingly.p  pReading about the issues related to using STL classes in a DLL interface, I gather in summaryp  ul lipUsing stdvector in a DLL interface would require all the clients of that DLL to be compiled with the same emversionem of the same compiler because STL containers are not binary compatible. Even worse, depending on the use of that DLL by clients conjointly with other DLLs, the instable DLL API can break these client applications when system updates are installed e.g. Microsoft KB packages really.pli lipDespite the above, if required, stdvector can be used in a DLL API by exporting codestdvectorltBgtcode likep  precodetemplate class EXPORT stdallocatorltBgt template class EXPORT stdvectorltBgt codepre  pthough, this is usually mentioned in the context when one wants to use stdvector as a emmemberem of A httpsupport.microsoft.comkb168958.pli lipThe following Microsoft Support Article discusses how to access stdvector objects created in a DLL through a pointer or reference from within the executable httpsupport.microsoft.comdefault.aspxscidkbENUSQ172396. The above solution to use codetemplate class EXPORT ...code seems to be applicable too. However, the drawback summarized under the first bullet point seems to remain.pli lipTo completely get rid of the problem, one would need to wrap stdvector and change the signature of codemyFunctioncode, PIMPL etc..pli ul  pMy questions arep  ul lipIs the above summary correct, or do I miss here something essentialpli lipWhy does compilation of my class A not generate warning C4251 class stdvectorltTy needs to have dllinterface to be used by clients of... I have no compiler warnings turned off and I dont get any warning on using stdvector in codemyFunctioncode in exported class A with VS2005.pli lipWhat needs to be done to correctly export codemyFunctioncode in A Is it viable to just export codestdvectorltBgtcode and Bs allocator pli lipWhat are the implications of returning stdvector byvalue Assuming a client executable which has been compiled with a different compilerversion. Does trouble persist when returning byvalue where the vector is copied I guess yes. Similarly for passing stdvector as a constant reference could access to codestdvectorltBgtcode which might was constructed by an executable compiled with a different compilerversion lead to trouble within codemyFunctioncode I guess yes again..pli lipIs the last bullet point listed above really the only clean solutionpli ul  pMany thanks in advance for your feedback.p

Negative 364 pIm running into what seems to be a serious usability problem for users trying to use a Google Drive app from more than one account. In order for an app to be able to use Drive APIs on a users behalf, the user must install the associated Chrome Web Store app emwhile logged in as that userem. The problem is that the Chrome Web Store seems to look for an app being installed per browser, whereas the Drive API needs the app to be installed per user.p  pAs far as I can tell, the only way to install the same app for multiple users in the same Chrome browser is to install with one user, then log in as the second user, uninstall the app which the CWS says is already installed, and then reinstall it so that Drive will mark the app as installed for the second user. This is a very confusing experience, because during this process the app and the CWS are sending the user mixed messages about whether the app is installed.p  pIm not sure if theres a canonical app to test for system bugs like this. Is DrEdit live somewhere But if you want to see the problem behavior in our implementation, install the a hrefhttpschrome.google.comwebstoredetailbhdheahnajobgndecdbggfmcojekgdkoGraphing Calculator by Desmos.coma as one user, launch it and log in using google drive and verify that everything is working. Then log out from the app, and use a hrefhttpsaccounts.google.comhttpsaccounts.google.coma to log in to google as a different user, and try using the app again. The app will tell you that it isnt installed thats what Drives APIs are telling us and direct you to the CWS, which claims that the app emisem installed.p

Im trying to implement that and the form generates a token but it doesnt pass it in the URL to the showSuccess.php page so its now displaying my admin.php partial.  p  pI thought it had to do with the routing but I have the routing the same as they do and it still doesnt work.  p  precodecar   class sfDoctrineRouteCollection   options  model car, column token    requirements  token w   carshow   url cariditem.sfformat   class sfDoctrineRoute   options  model car, type object    param  module car, action show, sfformat html    requirements  iditem d, sfmethod get  codepre  pNow the form itself requires the token field in the URL, but when I submit the form its supposed to pass a tokenized URL to the success page so that a partial can be displayed, but the URL defaults to the iditem field instead of the token field so my partial doesnt render.p  pI found that if I change the name of the second route to something else or delete it, then the tokenized URLs work.   But then the regular URL doesnt.  p  pIs this something I need to change in the class filesp  pHere is my reference.  a hrefhttpwww.symfonyproject.orgjobeet14Doctrineen10 relnofollowSymfony Documentationap

Negative 364 pMy system involves sending very large amounts of data and metadata over TCP sockets.  I am sending a single object which contains various metadata, as well as twenty byte arrays.  Ive been working on small examples 130kB arrays so far using ObjectOutputStream enclosing a BufferedOutputStream.  I tried getting up to my goal of 67MB arrays, but ObjectOutputStream cant handle that much data.  I was able to send 1MB arrays, but writeObject hung up at 2MB.p  pIve heard that DataOutputStream is faster, but I would rather not have to encode my metadata as bytes and decode on the other side.  Is there a good alternative to be able to send very large objects quicklyp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI am already using reset after each write method.  I am currently sending a single SignedObject which encloses my own Message object which encloses the 20 arrays as well as a number of metadata fields.  I would prefer to keep this all packaged since it is so convenient, but I understand that separation may be the only way to go.  That being said, I would still need to make sure that all transmissions are secure.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo I went to lunch, came back, and decided Id try to figure out whether things were hanging on the send or receive end.  And then it never got hung up.  I could continue to successfully send up to 4MB arrays until I ran out of heap which is unrelated and just means I need a better computer or more efficient processing.  So I guess the problem went away  Doesnt mean I dont need a better way of transmitting this though, so Ill take more ideas if people have them.  Also, Im assuming as soon as I update this, it will stop working again...p

I have 2 problems that do not function correctly.  p  pFirstly, If the timer runs out on a question, it displays the next question but the timer does not reset.  The textviews stay at Times up and Time Elapsed 10000 instead of restarting the timer on the new question that is displayed.p  pLastly, on the Results page the correct score is not displayed in the textview.  The percentage textview displays correctly but the score textview displays android.widget.TextView416473c or some other random memory location.p  pThe program never crashes just functions incorrectly.

Negative 364 pApologies if this is fairly basic, Im a little out of my depth and could use a bit of guidance to fill in some blanks.p  pHeres the situation... Im querying the WordPress database to return a subset of posts which match a set of specific criteria relating to meta keyvalue conditions specifically, whether a key of dates contains a value which matches the next X days. This works fine  the code is currentlyp  precoderequest   SELECT DISTINCT ID FROM wpdbgtposts, wpdbgtpostmeta request .  WHERE wpdbgtposts.ID  wpdbgtpostmeta.postid request .  AND poststatuspublish AND posttypedays request .

Ive extended the code to allow for an OR rule to also return posts which match the first day of the month. The extended code looks likep  precoderequest   SELECT DISTINCT ID FROM wpdbgtposts, wpdbgtpostmeta request .  WHERE wpdbgtposts.ID  wpdbgtpostmeta.postid request .  AND poststatuspublish AND posttypedays request .  AND  request .  wpdbgtpostmeta.metakey  dates AND wpdbgtpostmeta.metavalue gt startDate AND wpdbgtpostmeta.metavalue lt endDate AND wpdbgtpostmeta.metavalue  today request .  OR  request .  wpdbgtpostmeta.metakey  dates AND wpdbgtpostmeta.metavalue  firstDayOfMonth  codepre  pNow I run into a problem. I want to expand the conditions for returning the new emmonthem posts by querying the metakey variable again. E.g., p  precodewpdbgtpostmeta.metakey  dayType AND wpdbgtpostmeta.metavalue  month codepre  pHowever, adding this in returns zero results. Ive tested querying just emoneem of the conditions either matching the first day of the month, or matching being a emmonthem, and I can return one or the other with no problem. Im pretty sure that the problem is that Im querying the same variable twice in the same string, with no consideration for ordering or distinction.

After searching I found that due to security reasons, requestFullScreen works only on event handlers for events like mouse clicks, keypress etc. I tried forcefully executing a click on the iFrame using jquery click and it comes into the click handler too but the requestFullScreen doesnt work. I tried clicking on the iFrame directly and it goes fullscreen.p  pHow do I make this work p  pHeres my code  for the parent on domainA. strongI have made sure that the post message handler is executed when my child on domain B posts a messagestrongp  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtmlgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjquery.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt     var container     function         container  parentFrame[0]         container.addEventListenerclick,goFullScreen         window.addEventListenermessage, receiveMessage, false               function receiveMessageevent                        Use this code to restrict request from  only one particular domain amp Port              Port not needed in this case             if event.origin  httpmyChildDomain.com                              return                          Retrieving relevant variables             var messageevent.data             var sourceevent.source             var originevent.origin              Forcefully generating a click event because fullscreen wont work when directly requested             container.click               goFullScreen  function          if container.mozRequestFullScreen               This is how to go into fullscren mode in Firefox              Note the moz prefix, which is short for Mozilla.             container.mozRequestFullScreen          else if container.webkitRequestFullScreen               This is how to go into fullscreen mode in Chrome and Safari              Both of those browsers are based on the Webkit project, hence the same prefix.             container.webkitRequestFullScreen                ltscriptgt ltbodygt ltiframe idparentFrame srchttpmyChildDomainchild.html width804 height600 frameborder0  scrollingno allowfullscreen styleborder 5px solid 00ff00gt ltiframegt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

This view strokes the path represented by the annotation. strongThis class does not fill the area enclosed by the pathstrong. You can change the color and other drawing attributes of the path by modifying the properties inherited from the MKOverlayPathView class.p blockquote  pThat just sounds ridiculous. I have to use this class to emsetem the fill color, but I cant use this class to emdrawem the fill color That just seems very odd considering it already draws the stroke.

Could they be used to clearfix these absolutepositioned elements My thought was that there might be a way to do something like the followingp  precodeslider imgbefore    content   displayblock   positionstatic  codepre  pIt will obviously take more than those styles to make this happen because it isnt rendering things how I want it to... I know by this point you may be thinking Why not just specify the height of the container and be done with it. Well, the slides are meant to be responsive in that when they shrink, so does the height of the container.p  pI really want to do as much of this as possible without resorting to jQuery to set the containers height relative to the image height... Its tempting, but I think theres ways around that...p  pI cant find anything online yet on how to do this or if it is possible. Can some CSS gurus step up and help me out here I would love to hear alternative ways to stack my slides, or mainly if it is possible to use the pseudoelements to retain the container height around my absolutelypositioned images...p  pstrongUpdatestrong jsFiddle here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netderekmx271Hu6Yf relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netderekmx271Hu6Yfap  pstrongUpdatestrong Getting close to a solution with this just need to lock down the same dimensions as the slides  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netderekmx271T7A7M relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netderekmx271T7A7Map
Negative 364 pRight now I have a SQL Server Table thats populated with data from external .CSV file that gets updated occasionally by having new data appended to it.  Originally I had my program set up to delete everything in the table every time its ran and it would upload everything from the .CSV file.  Now Im trying to reconfigure it so that it only inserts newly appended data from the file instead of deleting everything first. p  pThe program works by first delimiting data from the .CSV file that gets uploaded to array.  Then I basically go through the array and upload each element.  Right now I have secondary array that contains all the current primary keys from the Table and so far I have tried to compare these to the ones in the .CSV file thats being read.  So it checks if the the primary key from the .CSV file is not already in the table  secondary array it goes ahead and does the inserting.  This seems like a sound logic to be but for some reason I cant get it to work.p  pHere is the meat of my codep  precodeprivate void backgroundWorker1DoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e               Create new SQL connection and adapter using Windows Authentication         SqlConnection myConnection  new SqlConnectionData Sourcedatabase Initial CatalogDashboard Integrated SecuritySSPI Persist Security Infofalse TrustedConnectionYes         SqlDataAdapter da  new SqlDataAdapter          try                      myConnection.Open              da.InsertCommand  new SqlCommandINSERT INTO DashboardLibAnswerId,Date,Time,Question,Details,Answer,Notes,EnteredBy,WhereReceived,QuestionType,AnswerMethod,TransactionDuration                  VALUESId,Date,Time,Question,Details,Answer,Notes,EnteredBy,WhereReceived,QuestionType,AnswerMethod,TransactionDuration, myConnection              da.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddId, SqlDbType.NVarChar             da.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddDate, SqlDbType.Text             da.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddTime, SqlDbType.Text             da.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddQuestion, SqlDbType.Text             da.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddDetails, SqlDbType.Text             da.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddAnswer, SqlDbType.Text             da.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddNotes, SqlDbType.Text             da.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddEnteredBy, SqlDbType.NVarChar             da.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddWhereReceived, SqlDbType.NVarChar             da.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddQuestionType, SqlDbType.NVarChar             da.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddAnswerMethod, SqlDbType.NVarChar             da.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddTransactionDuration, SqlDbType.NVarChar              Using the global variable counter this loop will go through each valid entry and insert it into the specifed databasetable             for int i  0 i lt counter i                              This is where I try to do the comparision.                  idS is the secondary array with all the current primary keys in the Table                 collection is the primary array that stores new data from the .CSV file                 if idS.ElementAti  collection.getIdItemsi                                      da.InsertCommand.Parameters[Id].Value  collection.getIdItemsi                     da.InsertCommand.Parameters[Date].Value  collection.getDateItemsi                     da.InsertCommand.Parameters[Time].Value  collection.getTimeItemsi                     da.InsertCommand.Parameters[Question].Value  collection.getQuestionItemsi                     da.InsertCommand.Parameters[Details].Value  collection.getDetailsItemsi                     da.InsertCommand.Parameters[Answer].Value  collection.getAnswerItemsi                     da.InsertCommand.Parameters[Notes].Value  collection.getNotesItemsi                     da.InsertCommand.Parameters[EnteredBy].Value  collection.getEnteredByItemsi                     da.InsertCommand.Parameters[WhereReceived].Value  collection.getWhereItemsi                     da.InsertCommand.Parameters[QuestionType].Value  collection.getQuestionTypeItemsi                     da.InsertCommand.Parameters[AnswerMethod].Value  collection.getAnswerMethodItemsi                     da.InsertCommand.Parameters[TransactionDuration].Value  collection.getTransactionItemsi                     da.InsertCommand.ExecuteNonQuery                                    Updates the progress bar using the i in addition to 1                  worker.ReportProgressi  1                end for              Once the importing is done it will show the appropriate message             MessageBox.ShowFinished Importing            end try         catch Exception exceptionError                      To show exceptions thrown just uncomment bellow line             rtbOutput.AppendTextexceptionError.ToString            end catch          Closes the SQL connection after importing is done         myConnection.Close        end backgroundWorker1DoWork  codepre  pRight now the program executes but no new data is being inserted.

Negative 364 pI am using Spring Batch. I have a sql statement which is built up from multiple xml file elements. All of the results come from the same table, but each of the statements have a different XXX as keyValue. I have extended both a JdbcCursorItemReader, where I use a setSql to set the sql String and this works fine. However performance isnt great and it cant be multithreaded. I then switched to extending a SqlPagingQueryProviderFactoryBean and adding a thread pool executor to my tasklet and for one simple sql statement I have noticed a significant decrease in time.      What I need to know is how to use my complex sql with unions and the SqlPagingQueryProviderFactoryBean, is this possible.

Negative 364 pIve had huge troubles with this for quite a while now. A few days ago after rebuilding my project, I got an error saying TapkuLibrary.h was not found. I removed the files attached to the project and followed the directions exactly directed at a hrefhttpsgithub.comdevinrosstapkulibrary relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdevinrosstapkulibraryap  pHowever, when I tried to rebuild my project, the file is still not foundp  pIm using XCode 4.6.1 building for iOS 6.1p  pI can see that the files attached to the xcode project from Tapku can be found because I can find them in the side bar. For some reason though, TapkuLibrary.h is not found.p  pAlso, when I control a class, it links me to the right symbol for all files except TapkuLibrary.h which is, again, not found.p  pIm quite stressed by this, so any clues would be immensely appreciated. Thank you so much in advancep  pUPDATE Ive tried gain to remove all the files and readd them to no avail.p

Negative 364 pI am creating a RESTful web service and I need to map the methods that I want to expose as paths. I got one question regarding the organization of service classes.p  pIs it normal to create one service class that is the endpoint of the application which internally delegates to other service classesp  pAnd how do you organize methods and paths belonging to a resource Do you create one MyClassCrudService class, one MyClassOperationsService class etc And then add that path mapping annotations on each class, or do you create one MyClassResourceService classp  pI find it hard to divide the service methods in different classes, and naming them properly.p  pI could need some guidance on how it is normal to organize the services.p

Negative 364 pI am developing an app, which uses UIWebView. I am implementing the manual load counting method as in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions908367uiwebviewhowtoidentifythelastwebviewdidfinishloadmessagerq1UIWebView  How to identify the quotlastquot webViewDidFinishLoad messageap  pI can see the calls for startfinishfailLoad balanced in principle. However, with a few web pages most particularly, google.com, the page initially loads well and after a few seconds automatically seems to refresh itself. The startfinish sequence looks as belowp  precode[MyWebView webViewDidStartLoad], 1, 0x895150c [MyWebView webViewdidFailLoadWithError], 0, 0x895150c [MyWebView webViewDidStartLoad], 1, 0x895150c [MyWebView webViewDidStartLoad], 2, 0x895150c [MyWebView webViewDidFinishLoad], 1, 0x895150c [MyWebView webViewDidFinishLoad], 0, 0x895150c [MyWebView webViewDidStartLoad], 1, 0x895150c   lt after a few seconds gap [MyWebView webViewDidFinishLoad], 0, 0x895150c codepre  pThe first argument is the function being called, second is the value of the counter and the last value is the address of the loadCounter, just to confirm that it is the same webView instance and hence the counter being called. I am running out of clues ... p  pDoes anyone have any clue, what might be happening here BTW, this does not happen for many other websites, so far only with Googlep  pEDIT Why it matters to me is, because while it refreshes apparently randomly, it dismisses the keyboard. This is annoying if a user is already in the middle of typing something. Is it possible to relegate any further refreshes to the site in the background, while continuing the user interaction particularly keyboard in the frontp  pTIA, Nikhilp
Negative 364 pI am completely lost and need help Ill be the first to admit that Im no expert so if you ask why I did something the way I did, the answer is simple, I try stuff until it works. However, I cannot get this one straight. All I need to do is add up an array guessing its an array. If you take a look you can see that my code finds the order id from the url with codeGET[id]code then puts all products ordered for that order in an array. And finally get the cost of each product in the order. With the code as it is, it lists the cost for every produced ordered. What I would like to do is get the sum for the cost of every product in the order. Might be 1 product for one order the 10 for the next so it would have to be dynamic.

Negative 364 pIm trying to setup logging with a program using the jackrabbitstandalone2.6.0.jar.

Right now it writes a big amount of DEBUG messages to a file called jackrabit.logISUNDEFINED and I urgently need to suppress this. There are several hints  to be found in the internet suggesting to setup the logger but I dont exactly understand what I need to do. The classes  DOMConfigurator and PropertyConfigurator are not available within the package, but when adding for example slf4jlog4j121.7.2.jar I get the above described messages. So I cant initialize the logger within my program.  It was said to add the configurationXML to the classpath. I tried this in Eclipse I added the folder conatining the XML to the BuildPath, then I created a jarfile from my XMLFile and added this jarfile to the BuildPath but it didnt make any difference.p  pI read the description Default Initialization Procedure in a hrefhttplogging.apache.orglog4j1.2manual.html relnofollowhttplogging.apache.orglog4j1.2manual.htmla but have to state that I didnt understand it at all. What does it mean 2. Set the resource string variable to the value of the log4j.configuration system property. The preferred way to specify the default initialization file is through the log4j.configuration system property. In case the system property log4j.configuration is not defined, then set the string variable resource to its default value log4j.properties.

Negative 364 pA Web Server can receive millions of user login request. A user can login multiple times. Design an optimal algorithmdatastructure in terms of time complexity to return total number of unique users between given time intervals.p  pFor e.g  Count total number of unique users between interval t1 amp t2 and t2 amp t3. Also think about returning total count for overlapping intervals t1  10am, t2  1015am, t3  1030am, return total number of users between 1010am to 1020amp  pBelow is what I am proposing, Would appreciate peoples commentsp  pIMO combination of Hashmap amp min heap would be good as an optimal solution.p  pHashmap will have key as userid and value as node pointer to corresponding node in          min heap. Min heap  lastloggedin time as key and value as the userid. Root will be the user             whose login time is the oldest. Also at the root store the count of total             number of nodes in the minheap so we can quickly return the count.p  ol lipWhen a user logsin. Lookup in the hashmap with userid as key. a If no match then insert the new user into hashmap amp a new node for user into    the min heap and increment the count stored with the root node of min heap. b else its an old user update its lastloggedin value and do not increment the    count in root node of min heap.pli lipWhenever we want to find out the unique users logged between t2t1 then  a. Extract minroot from the heap and check if         current time  lastloggedin time  t2t1 mins. If it is greater than        delete the value from the hashmap amp minheap.  b. Repeat the above step a until the min element of the heap satisfies         current time  lastloggedin time lt t2t1 mins  c. Return the value of the count from root node of the min heap.pli ol  pBut I am not able to nail down the algorithm for overlapping intervals.p

Negative 364 pI am working on a project using an Entity Framework CodeFirst approach. We have a context class, service, repository and interface layers. We would like to be able to keep validation and any sort of object mapping in the service class for the specific entity. However, we dont really like messing with Lists of Key Value Pairs, and we feel passing the entire form collection to the service would be burdensome. And, using passing a Model back from the View would result in string entries converting to 0 for numeric properties... halting any proper validation. We know there is the Entity Validation that would prevent a form from even being submitted, but we would like a layer of security if you will by using validation in the backend. p  pOur googlefu is reaching an end Our powers useless. p  pWe would like to know if there is any nice and clean way of passing a data from a Form collection from the controller to a Service method without using a List of Key Value Pairs, passing the collection itself, or mapping a Modelp

Negative 364 pHeres a description of the problem for starters, I have a background logo image displaying on the webpage version codescreencode media at the top of the page spanning the entire width of the page basically a masthead.p  pThen I added a print stylesheet and have been hiding and showing certain parts to optimize the experience for users and their printers .p  pHowever, and heres the problem, I noticed that on IE in every page of the print preview the logo image is being added to the top of every page in the print out when the page content is enough for more than one page in the total number of pages. So if theres enough content for 3 pages then in all those three pages the logo image appears at the top every page in the print out, when it should only appear in the 1st one.p  pIve checked my CSS and I cant find whats going on. I dont have the section that contains the CSS class that defines the background image repeated more than once. This only happens on IE. Not on Chrome nor Firefox. p  pHeres an excerpt of the HTMLp  precode    ....     ltbodygt         ltdiv classrepeatingbgimggt             ltdiv classcontainergt             ...             lt .inner content that is long enough for more than one page gt              ...             ltdivgtlt .container gt         ltdivgtlt .repeatingbgimg gt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pand heres an excerpt of the CSS in the codeprint.csscode stylesheet with media  codeprintcode p  precode.repeatingbgimg      background ffffff url..imgbackgroundimage.png scroll repeatx left top  codepre  pHas anyone encountered this before on IE If so, do you have a fix for thisp

Negative 364 pi have a grid view and a file upload button on a page.  I have users load their data to my site and i parse their files and load onto the gridview. Then using ajax i update the javascriptjquery I allow users to edit their data right on the gridview. My problem is somehting that should be simple to fix but yet im stumped. Once the user is ready to submit the gridview data for good i have an AJAX call to a webservice that i send all the information on the grid. Then i would like to clear the grid and basically start with a clean page again. However i cant seem to clear the grid view. The data just keeps refreshing in the control with the original data. I realize that it has to do with the fact that is bound on the server but i cant unbinded. i have tried.p  precodewindow.location.reload codepre  pbut all this does its get me a crappy message from firefox telling me that the page is going to refresh.p  pI saw this on this site from various peoplep  precodeResponse.RedirectRequest.RawUrl codepre  phowever i dont know how i can trigger that from an Ajax call. Can i Im doing everything through Ajax partly because is where im most comfortable, but i would hate to have to put another button on the page and make the user have to click that button to restart it seems silly. I would like to do a full page refresh on my command. Is there anyway to  do this via AJAX  putting a server button does not seem feasible to me due to the fact that once i load data in grid view i use jquery data table and jeditable and work pretty much on the client.  Im open to suggestion, ideas, tips, anything at this point. So frustrated with what should be a simple task.  Thanks in advance  Miguel  p

Negative 364 pIm translating strings in PHP with Gettext and Poedit software. I would like to use translated strings also in JavaScript, but without putting the code inline into HTMLdocuments, but in external files. Inline in HTMLdocuments it would be no problem because the inline JScode is also rendered. An examplep  precodevar hello  lthellogt codepre  pThe translator should use the same translationtables as the phpcode does because of duplicate strings.p  pSo my idea was to compile the JavaScript files with PHP. For example in an external JSfile is this codep  precodeif window.confirmtranslateareyousure  location.href  this.href  codepre  pA php script reads this code above and finds all strings inside codetranslatecode. The code will replace codetranslateareyousurecode with the translated string. It works but is never translating, because the Poedit software will not find the string in codetranslatecode even if I add translate into the keys of the source.

Negative 364 pHi I have the following problem. I use strongjQuery file upload pluginstrong and want to implement file uploader in one of my website pages. I am using the stronga hrefhttpblueimp.github.iojQueryFileUpload relnofollowUI versionastrong so the thing is working, the files are uploaded but when i try to delete them i have an 404 error on the request. I am using POST request. The problem is that I get 404 header error and that is screwing the code. My page is responding with the right JSON data but the header is 404 I searched the whole [uploader class][3], but i cant find where the header is set and even if I comment that 404 linep  pcodeif thisgtisvalidfileobjectfilename      return thisgtheaderHTTP1.1 404 Not Found codep  pNothing happens so I cant understand where in which javascript file or in the stronga hrefhttpsgithub.comblueimpjQueryFileUploadblobmasterserverphpUploadHandler.php relnofollowupload handler classastrong the headers go wrong and how to fix the problem.p  pSo my ajax return is like followsp  blockquote   pmethodDELETE   mydomaingsomepageuploadActionfileactiontestfile32028129.docp      pPOST 404 Not Found textplain jquery.js8706 Script 991B 360B 20ms 20msp blockquote  pI think the problems comes from my framework cause in plain php I can upload and delete files. But when i open the page in my browser with that link I can see the JSON response which isp  precodefilenameactiontestfile3.doc, size61440, urlhttpmydomainfilesactiontestfile3.doc, deleteUrlhttpmydomainsomepageuploadActionfileactiontestfile3.doc methodDELETEfileactiontestfile3.docmethodDELETE,deleteTypePOST codepre  pI dont know what I need to get so the file be deleted, but I know that the header information is gone wrong cause I can open it and see the information but the POST request sees the 404 error and just doesnt do nothing. p  pThe framework I use have a .htaccess rewrite rule which is the followingp  precodeRewriteEngine On RewriteRule .jsicogifjpgpngcssswfhtctxtdocdocxxlsxlsxpdfhtmhtml bmpflvxmlzipplistipawoffttfsvgeotdesign.sks. index.php codepre  pBut I dont think the rule has anything to do with this upload.

And I have writedelete permissions on the directory.p  pemstrongI dont get any javascript errors and in my php log there are not errors regarding this page.emstrongp  pemSo I think the problem is with the header information and if it returns 404 the file is just not deleted that is all. But I cant understand where and how this is happening.emp  pSo feel free to ask me anything but I cant send you a live demo cause it is a developer server, but I will do anything to try and resolve this problem cause I am struggling with it for almost 2 days.

Im populating the dictionary using a codeReadOnlyCollectioncode of codeMyObjectscode.  Perhaps something odd is happening there  I tried overriding the codecode operator and codeEqualscode methods to get the explicit comparison I wanted, but no such luck.

There was a background thread that was performing some operations on the dictionary which seem to be triggering a resort of the collection adding items to the collection would do this.  At the same time, when the dictionary iterated through the values to find my key, the collection was being changed and it was not finding my key even though it was there.p  pSorry for all of you who asked for code on this one, Im currently debugging an application that I inherited and I didnt realize this was going on on a timed, background thread.  As such, I thought I copied and pasted all the relevant code, but I didnt realize there was another thread running behind everything manipulating the collection.p

Negative 364 pIm attempting to do a pubsub architecture where multiple publishers and multiple subscribers exist on the same bus. According to what Ive read on the internet, only one socket should ever call bind, and all others whether pub or sub should call connect.p  pThe problem is, with this approach Im finding that only the publisher that actually calls bind on the socket ever publishes messages. All of my publishers that call connect seem to fail silently and dont actually publish any messages to the bus. Ive confirmed this isnt a subscriber key issue, as Ive written a simple sniffer app that subscribes to emallem messages on the bus, and it is only showing the publisher that called bind.p  pIf I attempt multiple binds with the publisher, the expected zmq behavior of silently stealing the bus occurs with ipc, and a port in use error is thrown with tcp.p  pIve verified this behavior with ipc and tcp endpoints, but ultimately the full system will be using epgm. I assume though of course may be wrong that in this situation I wouldnt need a broker since theres no dynamic discovery occurring endpoints are known, whether ipc, tcp, or epgm multicast. p  pIs there something Im missing, perhaps a socket setting, that would be causing the connecting publishers to not actually send their data According to the literature Ive seen on the internet, Im doing things the correct way but it still doesnt work.p  pFor reference, my publisher class has the following methods for setting up the endpointp  precodeZmqPublisherZmqPublisher  mzmqContext1, mzmqSocketmzmqContext, ZMQPUB    void ZmqPublisherbindEndpointstdstring ep      mzmqSocket.bindep.cstr   void ZmqPublisherconnectstdstring ep      mzmqSocket.connectep.cstr  codepre  pSo ultimately, my question is this What is the proper way to handle multiple publishers on the same endpoint, and why am I not seeing messages from more than one publisherp
Negative 364 pI am trying to figure out if the significant performance hit Im seeing is something that can be optimized away or is this the state of thingsp  pI have a geometry that looks like Obama, its about 11K triangles, 5600 or so faces both quads and triangles. It was modeled in Maya, and is exported as OBJ in one of two methods depending upon the render method being used. p  pIn one export method, we do not export the materials file from Maya. We take the 5 different texture maps used by the model, stitch them into a single texture and rewrite the UVs in the model to reference the new texture locations in the unified texture. The final unified texture is 1024x512.p  pThe 2nd export method does use the exported materials file from Maya, and we reduce the 5 different textures to be smaller in all cases than their counterpart in the unified texture used by the other method. If the 5 different textures were tiled, youd get something about 768x512. p  pThe only other difference between the two methods of rendering the same geometry is the second method has 1 semitransparent material the cornea the clear layer over the eyes is set to 0.1 barely visible transparency and a slightly bluegray tint. p  pIn place of the semitransparent cornea in the first rendering method, we simply have the image of the eyeball on the cornea, and the inner eye iris and pupil are never seen by this method. They are there, just discarded by rendering because they are behind the opaque cornea. p  pNow heres the big puzzle render method 1 easily hits 60 fps and stays there with two such geometries. Render method 2 is rendering between 20 and 25 frames per second. Ive not tried rendering with a second geometry yet. Im somewhat surprised at this significant reduction in my frame rate. If I change the semitransparent cornea to be opaque, the frame rate is still poor same rate. p  pBoth methods use the THREE.JSONLoader. Render method 1 uses a single MeshLambertMaterial, and render method 2 uses meshFaceMaterial and the array of 6 materials.p  pIs there that much of a hit from using multiple materials and multiple textures What are people doing with more complex environments requiring exponentially more materials than my paltry 6 p

Looks like there is some internal code doing that for the ListView, so the solution was to put them in a container and showinghiding it completely.p  pSo basically, the idea is When the datas are loading, I want to show the loading view, for that, I hide the ListView container by putting its Visibility to GONE if I put the Visibility to INVISIBLE, it keeps the size of the list in the View, using GONE is like removing it completely and thus, the loading view can take all the screen and showing the the loading view by putting its visibility to VISIBLE.p  pIn my ListFragment, I got the references of these views like thisp  precodeOverride public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstance     View v  inflater.inflateR.layout.kanjilist, null     mLoadingView  LoadingViewv.findViewByIdR.id.loading     mListContainer  LinearLayoutv.findViewByIdR.id.listcontainer     return v  codepre  pAnd I showhide the loading view by calling this methodp  precodeprivate void setLoadingViewVisibleboolean visible     ifnull  mLoadingView ampamp null  mListContainer         mListContainer.setVisibilityvisible  View.GONE  View.VISIBLE         mLoadingView.setVisibilityvisible  View.VISIBLE  View.GONE       codepre

Negative 364 pI need some input on how to do this in a good way. p  pMy application works today like this.p  pIt reads a recordset from an sql server, loops through this and creates semicolon separated rows of data that it puts into an codeArrayListltStringgtcode. p  pThis ArrayList i send to an output class that opens a filewriter and loops through the ArrayList printing all the rows adding a linebreak to each row.p  pBut now I want to edit the function in this way. p  pRecordset comes in, each time the semicolon row is completed im gonna put in some verification method on the row to check its validity. If the row is valid, then nothing above should change. But if the row isnt valid, then it should send the entire document all rows that are connected to this invalid row to an erroroutput. p  pSo im looking for how to build up a good mechanism to be able to save rows of data for each loop of the recordset and then send the document all attached rows to either good data or bad data writer.p  pThe trick here is that the semicolon rows that are created consists of header and X rows and sometimes Header, Subheader and then X rows. So if one of the rows fail I want all of the rows that should have been attached to that header to fall in to the error output.p  pI think there are better ways to apply what im trying to do and probably in a JAVA way, because im mainly a PHP programmer, and I started this project long ago before my JAVA skills were at the point they are now.p

Negative 364 pI am fairly new when it comes to designing a system to carry data though multiple layers from backend to frontend. p  pCurrently I have a class which when run, will immediately run a query on a date range of data and write it to a file.

I want to in a sense cache or hold onto a single instance of my lump data so that other higher level classes can call accessor methods on the parts of my data I want without multiple queries to the server needing to be made.p  pThis might be too much of a high level design pattern question to answer without much detail, but any advice or pushes in the right direction for further research would be appreciated.p

The class should look like something like this.p  precodeimport lib601.sm as sm  counter  0 class FollowFiguresm.SM     def initself, waypointsList         self.waypoints  waypointsList     def getNextValuesself, state, inp         global counter         sensors  inp         currentpoint  sensors.odometry.point           if counter  0             while notself.waypoints[0].isNearcurrentpoint, 0.01                 return state, self.waypoints[0]             counter  1         if counter  1             while notself.waypoints[1].isNearcurrentpoint, 0.01                 return state, self.waypoints[1]             counter  1         if counter  2             while notself.waypoints[2].isNearcurrentpoint, 0.01                 return state, self.waypoints[2]             counter  1                         if counter  3             while notself.waypoints[3].isNearcurrentpoint, 0.01                 return state, self.waypoints[3] codepre  pSo the class must check a condition which changes with time, if that condition is not satisfied return inp[0] and wait until it is satisfied and do not check other conditions. if the condition is satisfied for inp1[0] go to the next while, and on the next call of this class do not check the previous whiles. I have been thinking on this for the past 5 hours and can not figure out how to solve it. It should not be that hard. Maybe I can not concentrate good enough.p  pI have tried to write a for loop for this, but since this class is called 10 times each second in some cases it does not have the output it should have, because the iteration is reset each time it is called. BTW this class should work for any finite lenght inp1.p  pEdit The above code works good for an input list with 4 elements.p

Negative 364 pEDIT Solved, thanks to  MGorgon.p  pIm creating a simple game thatfor the moment allows you to move a dot 1 step in each direction of the current position with mouse clicks. However this only works when the board is a squareyou can chose the size of the board. The board is represented by buttons with images and a 2D array to keep track of the position where 1 is the position of the dot and 0 is a free space. Pos1 and Pos2 in the actionlistener prints out the position of the button which is clicked. So, this works great when the game board is a square but when I change the board into rectangles I get incorrect pos1 and pos2 values which Im using to move the dot.p  precode    creates the array and sets dot start position.     forint i0iltxAxisi              forint j0jltyAxisj                                 board[i][j]0                                  board[xAxis2][yAxis2]1 codepre  p,p  precode    Creates buttons and adds actionslistener and images to the buttons.     forint i0iltxAxisi                                 forint j0jltyAxisj                      buttons[i][j]  new JButton             buttons[i][j].setIconcircleIMG             buttons[i][j].setBorderPaintedfalse             buttons[i][j].addActionListenerGBC             buttons[i][j].setPreferredSizenew Dimension52,52               buttons[i][j].setRolloverIconcircleDotIMG             buttons[i][j].setRolloverEnabledtrue              GameBoardPanel.addbuttons[i][j]                             buttons[xAxis2][yAxis2].setIconcircleDotIMG codepre  p.p  precode    implements the actionlistener     public class GridButtonClick implements ActionListener             int xControl0            int pos10     int pos20     boolean Move  false      public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                  int posxFindXposboard         int posyFindYposboard                     forint i0iltxAxisi                      forint j0jltyAxisj                              ifbuttons[i][j]  e.getSource                                                             pos1i                     pos2j                     System.out.printlnposx posx                     System.out.printlnposy posy                     System.out.printlnpos1 pos1                     System.out.printlnpos2 pos2                     System.out.printlnn                           ifpos1  posx1 ampamp pos2  posy1  pos1  posx1 ampamp pos2  posy1                             Movetrue                                                                                       ifpos1  posx1 ampamp pos2  posy1  pos1  posx1 ampamp pos2  posy1                             Movetrue                                                               ifpos1  posx1 ampamp pos2  posy  pos1  posx1 ampamp pos2  posy                             Movetrue                                                           ifpos2  posy1 ampamp pos1  posx  pos2  posy1 ampamp pos1  posx                             Movetrue                                              ifMove                                              ifyAxisgtxAxis                         buttons[xAxis2][yAxis21].setIconcircleIMG                          else ifxAxisgtyAxis  xAxisyAxis                         buttons[xAxis2][yAxis2].setIconcircleIMG                           RemovePreviousMarkboard                         board[i][j]  1                         buttons[i][j].setIconcircleDotIMG                         System.out.printlnButton press [i][j]                         System.out.printlnx i y j                         Movefalse                                                                             codepre

Negative 364 pI am trying to run an octave script through PHP. I already googled and found some results but none of them are working for me. I tried with exec and system.

The octave script simply creates a new file and writes some text to it. When i directly run the bat file by doubleclicking on it, the file is getting created properly. I also added folder path to octaverc file but it doesnt seem to work. I need to do some image processing in octave for which I already wrote the script. I need to invoke this script on a client request and send the result to back the client. I am checking the invocation process through a sample script which as I mentioned earlier creates a new file.

Negative 364 pMy java program has multiple classes, each containing a separate JFrame. All three JFrames are started in my main class, and are set to setVisiblefalse so they are hidden. When a button from a JPopUpMenu is clicked, the respective JFrame is set to setVisibletrue. In these classes I have definedp  precode UIManager.setLookAndFeelUIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName codepre  pWhen I run each class separately by rightclicking the .java file in NetBeans and choosing Run File, the Look and Feel works perfectly. However, when I run the main class and setVisibletrue on the JFrame, the look and feel does not work. I thought this may have been just an error with NetBeans, so I tried building the .jar and running it. The problem is still there. The main classs Look and Feel has been set using the same code, and that works perfectly. I am not sure what to do. Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 364 pI am still relatively new to MVC and am finding every new concept to be a struggle, so please forgive me if this is an overly simple concept or the question has been asked many times before I tried to find other examples.p  pI have several modals that can be called from my shared layout using jQuerys dialog. Each modal is simply a DIV with a partial view attached to it like thisp  precodeltdiv idJoinDialog titleJoin the Contractor Network styledisplay nonegt     Html.PartialJoinPartial ltdivgt codepre  pAnd is called like thisp  precode    .ClickToJoin.clickfunction           function               JoinDialog.dialog width auto, height auto               codepre  pI have added a Profile modal to the layout in which I would like to insert the users data into the INPUT values. To do that, I presume that I will need to pass in a model, and load the data I want via the controller. Since I currently have this partial view in the Shared folder, I assume I will also need to move it to one of my view folders where I can attach it to a controllerp  pAny nudge in the right direction would be appreciated.p

Negative 364 pI am using codelogstashformattercode python module for sending formatted logs to logstash. The codelogstashformattercode is converting my passed dictionary to a JSON string.

All the JSON fields will automatically be added as tags or fields to logstash and will appear same as a filter in Kibana.p  pBut nothing like that happened, I still have to add the filters into my codeshipper.confcode file. Actually the log message is coming as a message fieldtag in the logstash reply. p  pNow I feel that there is no need of using this package. I would have instead create a dict on my own and converted it to JSON using codejsoncode module.p  pKindly guide me if I am missing something or my understanding about this formatter is totally wrong.p

Negative 364 pI am working on an assignment that I have. It is fairly straight forward. An HTML form which contains a single input is submitted to a Servlet that grabs the parameter, creates a message based on the parameter, adds the message as an attribute to the request, and uses a requestdispatcher to forward to a jsp to display the message.p  pI have a requirement that if the parameter is missing, I need to display an error page. The catch is that I cant explicitly check for a null, or use a trycatch block. My guess is that the goal is to define an error page in the web.xml page to handle errors of a certain type, but the problem is, if I cant check to see if the request parameter is null, or use a trycatch, how do I know if I need to throw an exception Any ideasp

Negative 364 pI have come up against a problem and Im struggling to find the best solution.p  pI have a very rectangleshaped SVG that I have 3 versions of, eg desktoptabletphonep  pOriginally, Ive been using the codeltpicturegtcode element with codeltsourcegtcode tags and linking to the SVG. Although when done this way, on mobile chrome, the image does not retain its rectangle shape and forces it into a square. If I set a maxheight, all that happens is that the svg artwork is squashed and obscured and the white space both top and bottom of the SVG remains.p  pHowever, on desktop I never got this issue.p  pWhen I use the codeltsvggtcode tag, with an codeltimagegtcode element, all the problems go away and as long as I set a max height, it works across the board, although Im unable to use the codeltpicturegtcode element this way, which means I cannot make use of the handy mediaquery attributes.p  pThe last thing, I havent tried yet because I do not want it to be implemented in this way would be to set the SVG as a background on a block element.p  pI appreciate any experienced input on this, perhaps someone with a bit more SVG cross platform knowledge than myselfp

Negative 364 pI wrote a simple little maze game for a terminal which repeatedly asks the user to do something e.g. In which direction would you like to go [NESW].

I deliberately put all the references to the terminal in a codeConsoleUtilscode class which implements a codeUtilscode interface this has methods like codeaskQuestioncode  the idea being that I could create a codeGuiUtilscode class and have my game emeitherem as a terminal game emorem as a GUI game. p  pThe problem is that the codenavigatecode method asks the user a question and then waits for the response, which the codeUtilscode class gives it by using a codeScannercode to read the newest line of input. However if I use Event Listeners for the new NESW buttons in my GUI, they fire off events regardless whether the codenavigatecode method has asked for one or not. a hrefhttpimgur.com1JrhN9c relnofollow Image of GUIa p  pIs there any way I can combine this or do I need to write a new codenavigatecode method for the GUI p  pTo be honest, Im also not entirely sure whether my GUI class should instantiate a codegamecode class, in which case the logic for codenavigatecode could end up in a GUI method anyway, or whether the game should have a GUI. I havent written any code for the event listener either yet, since Im not sure which class should be calling which. This is probably a separate question.p

Negative 364 pI am doing my final Matric project and I am stuck. Basically what my app does is it plots a study schedule for you. My cousin gave me the idea of looping through a couple of times, generating about 10 study schedules and assigning values to them and the highest value is the chosen timetable to give to the user. p  pI am trying to generate a random table, where it plots the timetable with some preloaded subjects, their exam dates and their score  the user got which will all be populated later dynamically. I am just testing now. p  pMy issue I am facing now is It only loads the first subject, it does not set the next subject. I have tried to put in constraints such as the maximum amount of time that can be allocated to the one subject, but it does not work for some reason probably bad code. p  pSo what needs to happen is it needs to see how long we have to study per subject according to what subject is before the other in terms of exam dates so english more than IT for example which is where the score comes in. That was inverted from the lowest percentage to a higher percentage. p  pHere is the code for the weighting classp  precodepublic void dayCounter      days  new ArrayListltDaygt      loop through for how many days we have to study     forint i  0 i lt nodays i           create new day object to store data in         DateTime d  startDate.plusDaysi          create new day with how many hours we have to study that day         Day day  new Day2          set the date and time for the new day object         day.setDateTimed          get monday  sunday, what day it is         DateTime.Property dayOfWeek  d.dayOfWeek          set the day of the week mon  sun as name of day object         day.setNamedayOfWeek.getAsText         forint j  0 j lt day.getMaxNumberOfHours j               Subject sub  getSubject             try                  ifsub  null ampamp sub.isAreHoursCompleted                      ArrayListltSubjectgt hoursPerDay  null                     ifsub.getExamDate.isBeforeday.getDateTime                          hoursPerDay  new ArrayListltSubjectgt                             forint x  0 x lt day.getMaxNumberOfHours x                              hoursPerDay.addnull                                                      sub.subjectByHoursAndDays.puti, hoursPerDay                         sub.totalHoursStudied                                          day.setSubjectsub.getName                     day.hours.setj, sub                      hoursPerDay.setj, sub                  else                      ifsub.isAreHoursCompleted                          int index  subjectsSortedByDate.indexOfsub.getName                         subjectsSortedByDate.removeindex                                                    catchException e                                 days.addday          System.out.printlndays.toString   public Subject getSubject      Subject s  null     ifrand.nextDouble gt 0.5           Assuming subjects are sorted by need to study most         forint i  0 i lt subjectsSortedByDate.size i               get the current subject in the list             Subject subjectToChoose  subjectsSortedByDate.geti              check if the hours are completed             ifsubjectToChoose.areHoursCompleted                   if the hours are not completed set the current subject                 s  subjectToChoose                  subject is set, so break out of for loop                 break                            else           get a random number in the subjects arraylist         int index  rand.nextIntsubjects.size         subjects.setindex, subjects.getindex          return s  codepre  pThe line that initializes coderandcode isp  pcoderand  new Randomint System.currentTimeMilliscodep  pAlso, how can I make sure that once the exam has happened, you do not need to study for that subject anymorep  pThanks in advance Joshp
Negative 364 pQuestion relates to the following build command which is part of a project I have inherited from a lost programmer who I cant ask to explain it. The project was based on the alsa utils latency sample, which he has extended to provide other functionality. The command works on the project but I want to start stripping out all the unused junk in the project and I kind of need to understand whats going here. I can program C and use gcc in the basic sense but I dont understand the below command very well. I wonder if anyone can confirm my assumptions below and explain a couple of bitsp  pI have this command to build the projectp  pif gcc DHAVECONFIGH I. I. I..include I..include   Wall pipe g g O2 MT latency.o MD MP MF .depslatency.Tpo c o latency.o latency.c then mv f .depslatency.Tpo .depslatency.Po else rm f .depslatency.Tpo  fi ampamp binbash ..libtool tagCC modelink gcc  lvgagl lvga Wall pipe g g O2   o latency  latency.o ..srclibasound.la p  pI think I understand whats going on here. Wall  warnings, pipe  irrelevant, g  debugging stuff, O2 optimization stuff, MT make an object file instead of executable, and overall the first bit of the command means make a dependency list from latency.c, and also compile latency.o. The dependency file is to be called .depslatency.Tpo.p  pIf the first command returns success then move .depslatency.Tpo to .depslatency.po, if it returns failure delete .depslatency.Tpo.p  pThen as long as the delete or move has succeeded, run the last bit after the ampamp. Which links latency.o, ..srclibasound.la, lvgagl and lvga together into the executable latency.p  pCurrently the project uses svgalib which I dont need it to do, so I will start by removing that, and I assume I can then remove the lvgagl lvga from the libtool command. p  pHowever I completely dont understand the DHAVECONFIGH I. I. I..include I..include portion. I know that I is a header file search path but why is it repeated twice And whats the DHAVECONFIGH mean And why bother making the dependency file if its not used again I see no other references to it during the libtool step.p
Negative 364 pLots of time spent with other languagetemplatingengine combinations, however fairly new to JSF and have the pleasure of taking over a legacy JSF 1.1 project that uses a a hrefhttpmvnrepository.comartifactjavax.facesjsfimpl1.102 relnofollowbasic Sun JSF liba and for political reasons can not be updated to something more modern like JSF 2.2 with PrimeFaces or IceFaces, which Id personally like to do after reading up on the capabilities of those.p  pThe setup is a simple web app with landing page plus two tabs Person amp Address, each powered by their own Backing Beans and JSF pages. Six total navigation states as each tab starts with a Search Form page which leads to a Search Results page on submit and then a View page emonmousedownem click action of an individual result for each of Person amp Address data. The Search Form pages are sessionscoped, and designed to pass search parameters around to each other in a header box entitled Users Search Query. It does this because the Search Results page for Address searches is really an overloaded Person search result with Address thrown in for Search for People by Address. Yes this could all probably be accomplished from a single page with some optional search params, but its not, and for whatever reason Im not permitted to change the core page structure, just tasked to bug fix.p  pTheres a longstanding bug Ive been asked to fix, where one page Person always shows search parameters from the other Address when both are set, because of some incomplete logic inside the panelGrid where the search query parameters are displayedp  precodelthoutputText valueCoverage Typegt lthoutputText valueaddressSearchUI.searchParameters.coverageType     renderedempty personSearchUI.searchParameters.coverageTypegt lthoutputText valuepersonSearchUI.searchParameters.coverageType    renderedempty personSearchUI.searchParameters.coverageTypegt codepre  pA little too overly simplistic if a Person searchs Coverage Type was set, use that, but if not, try to use the Address coverageType search parameter. Works great when only one or the other were set.p  pstrongPROBLEM CASESstrong Since they are session scoped, what if both of them were set in separate searches and were on the Address page The value from the old Person search displays and vice versa this is the main problem. What if neither of them are set yet It should show a default value of ALL COVERAGE, easy enough to add but doesnt address that main problem.p  pSOLUTION Thought this would be an easy fix but Ive hit a major wall trying to do either one of the following two simple things that I think would solve my problemp  pA get the sessionscoped value of one pages search parameter and reset it or set to empty string then that naiive presentation logic could be left as isp  pB call the reset button of one page programmatically from Java when backing bean init method gets called as we switch tabs I can call the method but am not sure how to get the original session instance rather than creating a new one, which will fire to a nonexistent page UIwisep  hr  pHeres what Ive tried so farp  pA Adding an strongactionListenerstrong attribute to the submit button itself and trying to forcibly reset values from the other Search Form. p  precodelthcommandButton        idpersonReset        styleClasssubmitButton        valueReset             actiontransactionSearchUI.resetSearchgt  lthcommandButton        idpersonSearch            styleClasssearchButton       valueSearch       renderedpersonSearchUI.canDo[performSearch]        actionListeneraddressSearchUI.resetSearch       actionpersonSearchUI.performSearchgt codepre  pB In the backing bean of each search, try to invoke the reset button of the otherp  precode utility method    private UIComponent findComponentString id, UIComponent where         if where  null            return null                else if where.getId.equalsid            return where                else            ListltUIComponentgt childrenList  where.getChildren           if childrenList  null  childrenList.isEmpty               return null                      for UIComponent child  childrenList               UIComponent result  null              result  findComponentid, child              ifresult  null                  return result                                  return null            ... then inside init method that is called when Person tab loads  FacesContext facesContext  FacesContext.getCurrentInstance UIViewRoot root  facesContext.getViewRoot       HtmlCommandButton button  HtmlCommandButton findComponentaddressReset, root ActionEvent actionEvent  new ActionEventbutton actionEvent.queue codepre  pFails with NullPointerException, so clearly cant access one tab from the others backing bean in this way unless Im missing something.p  pC JavaScript approach to reset values from one tab to the otherp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt function clearAddressSearchParams      document.getElementByIdAddressSearchaddressSearchaddressReset.click     document.forms[AddressSearchaddressSearch].reset     return false  window.onload  clearStats ltscriptgt codepre  pNeither of those clientside methods of trying to fire the Reset button action are going to work, since again, the Person and Address Search Forms were setup as two totally separate beans and pages even though one ultimately extends the other, one wont be active or available in the DOM so it wont find the elements.p  pAt this point, I know there is clearly a simpler solution, but Im at my wits end and probably coming at this from the wrong angle, so I dont know what else to do but put up a bounty for some of the JSF geniuses here. But if anyone can suggest a fix given my limitations of older JSF technology, no adding external libs and maintaining same basic code structure, youll get the bounty and tons of appreciation.p  pEDIT To summarize all this into a single question, can anyone suggest a reliable legacyJSF 1.1 compatible way to flush a session variable or reset it, independently of its page where it gets set being activep

Negative 364 pUp until iOS7, if I wanted to create a sort of a fixed background that would not rotate, animate or scale whatsoever, I would have simply attached a UIView to the main UIWindow. It was a kind of hack... but it served very well its purpose.p  pIn iOS8 they changed the way UIWindow behave among other things for example now code[UIScreen mainScreen].boundscode returns different size depending on the orientation.p  pAnyway...p  pMy question is how do I get iOS8 to behave as iOS7 and below I tried already to create two ViewControllers, one with codeshouldAutorotatecode method set to codeNOcode but with no luck.p  pThe desired effect is the one shown herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2afE8.png altenter image description hereimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDU6Yg.png altenter image description herep  pAny ideasp

Negative 364 pI recently published an app to the Amazon App Store.  After I found some unexpected bugs I made the fixes then uploaded a newer version.p  pI was more than a little surprised to find that the Amazon app store app doesnt actually notify the user that theres an update available.  As far as I can tell the only way for the user to ever find out about updates is to open the app, open the drawer, choose my apps then hit the refresh icon.  No one will ever bloody do that.  Ever.p  pThe only solution I could think of was to store the current version code on the server then add code to the app that would compare the version on the server to the version code on the manifest.  If the version on the server was higher which I set manually after a new update goes live on the store the app would prompt the user to update by means of a dialog.  Dismissing the dialog brings the user to that apps page in the amazon app store app.p  pSo that works great and all but guess what happens when the user is redirected to the Amazon apps page for my app  It says open not update.  If you hit the button it just brings you back to the app which just shows the dialog again.  There isnt even a refresh icon on that page.p  pOnce again, the ONLY way for users to find out the update, even after being brought directly to the apps app store page is to open the bloody drawer, choose my apps then hit the refresh button.p  pI must be missing something here.

We are thinking of changing either to hosting our public DNS externally, or keeping the primary onsite and move the secondary to a service like Google. I know it doesnt really make sense to keep our public DNS onsite or splitting it up, but the business owners would like to consider all possible options. I have looked through the documentation online and have contacted Google directly, but none of the sources I have checked will tell me if Google will allow us to use their DNS service to replicate a primary DNS server housed onsite and act as a secondary DNS for our domains. Does anyone here know if this is possible, and if it is what specifics they require to make it work. Any assistance that can be offered is appreciated.  p

Foreign keys are enabled by using PRAGMA foreignkeys  ON.p  pThe tables are created with the following statementsp  precodeCREATE TABLE conversation id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CREATE TABLE message id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, conversationid INTEGER, FOREIGN KEYconversationid REFERENCES conversation id ON DELETE CASCADE codepre  pThe statements are dumbed down to improve reading.p  pAs you can see, the foreign key conversationid is declared as NULLABLE, so that I am not forced to link every message to a conversation for example when a draft message gets created that has no corresponding conversation.p  pWhen I try to insert a new message with a conversationid, everything goes fine. When I try it without I get the following errorp  precode1107 164455.190  2058220582com.miawe.miabe EAndroidRuntime FATAL EXCEPTION main Process com.miawe.miabe, PID 20582 java.lang.RuntimeException Unable to start activity ComponentInfocom.miawe.miabecom.miawe.miabe.gui.MainActivity android.database.sqlite.SQLiteConstraintException foreign key constraint failed code 19         at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2195         at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2245         at android.app.ActivityThread.access800ActivityThread.java135         at android.app.ActivityThreadH.handleMessageActivityThread.java1196         at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java102         at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java136         at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5017         at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method         at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java515         at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java779         at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java595         at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method  Caused by android.database.sqlite.SQLiteConstraintException foreign key constraint failed code 19         at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteConnection.nativeExecuteForLastInsertedRowIdNative Method         at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteConnection.executeForLastInsertedRowIdSQLiteConnection.java782         at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteSession.executeForLastInsertedRowIdSQLiteSession.java788         at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteStatement.executeInsertSQLiteStatement.java86         at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase.insertWithOnConflictSQLiteDatabase.java1469         at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase.insertOrThrowSQLiteDatabase.java1365         at com.miawe.miabe.database.DatabaseDataSource.insertDatabaseDataSource.java244         at com.miawe.miabe.database.DatabaseDataSource.createDummyDataDatabaseDataSource.java307         at com.miawe.miabe.gui.MainActivity.onCreateMainActivity.java64         at android.app.Activity.performCreateActivity.java5231         at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnCreateInstrumentation.java1087         at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2159 at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2245 at android.app.ActivityThread.access800ActivityThread.java135 at android.app.ActivityThreadH.handleMessageActivityThread.java1196 at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java102 at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java136 at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5017 at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java515 at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java779 at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java595 at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method codepre  pIt seems like sqlite3 is ignoring my NULLconstraint and forcing every message to have a foreign key.

Negative 364 pI have a WebGL project setup that I would like to put an SVG mapping on top of. p  pThe reason for WebGL is to make a book with flipping pages.

I just need to know the best way to integrate the two of them together.p  pMy first thought because Im not really that well versed in WebGL just yet, is to just place the SVG absolute positioned over the WebGL canvas and that should work fine. p  pBut the problem is that I cannot retrieve the coordinates of the WebGL object.

I am willing to give up on the SVG if there is a better suited option available.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I know that you can change x, y and z of the object material, texture, or even move the camera in or out on the zindex which can affect what you are seeing. But what Im looking for is if there a way to get the Browser Screen pixel coordinates relating to the browser window regardless of where the object, camera, etc is positionedp  pFor example, if I have a cube setup on the WebGL canvas that fills the entire browser window width100 and height100. How can I tell where that cube is relating to the browser window not from within the canvas value in pixels I am essentially looking for the equivalent of the jQuery function offset but finding the object within the WebGL canvas top left coordinates but relating to the window. And say I zoom in using the camera, technically the object has not moved, but the object became smaller on the screen. How could I then know the coordinates relating to the window because the coordinates in WebGL will remain the samep

Negative 364 pI have a table, tableone, that contains two fields.  One is a folder path on a file system directorypath, for example, CfolderOne, and the other is the total file size in bytes totalszbytes contained in that folder, for example, 4235.p  pI am trying to use a SQL query to generate a list of values, starting from the top of the table, whose SUM of the total file size is less than a certain amount, given to the query like, 10000 bytes for example.p  pI have the following query so farp  precodeSELECT directorypath FROM tableone where 10000 gt  select sumtotalszbytes from tableone codepre  pBut all this does is return all of the entries in the table if the sum of all of them is less than that 10000 number.  So, if I had three folders in the table, folderone, foldertwo, and folderthree, the query would return all of them if their total file size was less than 10000, but none of them if the total file size was greater than 10000.  It doesnt matter if folderOne  folderTwo was 7000 if all of them put together is greater than 10000, the query returns nothing.p  pHow do I revise this query to get a partial list  p

Once a shape is drawn, I set up a listener on the polygons path so I can react after the path has been changedp  precodevar polygonPath  event.overlay.getPath google.maps.event.addListenerpolygonPath, setat, function         my code...  codepre  pThis works great when a user adds a new shape using the drawing tool. However, if I already have polygons in my database that I am displaying with the codeuigmappolygoncode AngularJS directive from the codeangulargooglemapscode project, how can I listen to the codesetatcode event since this event is not on the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationjavascriptreferencePolygon relnofollowpolygona, but is instead, on the polygons path a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationjavascriptreferenceMVCArray relnofollowMVCArrayap  pThe only place I was able to find a reference to codesetatcode in the source code of the codeangulargooglemapscode project was in the a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularuiangulargooglemapsblob4ac02c47cefeb760339f1ab9ca25e88d65b22551srccoffeeutilsarraysync.coffeeL12 relnofollowarraysync.coffeea file, but it doesnt look like it is being exposed.p  pIf I cant listen to the codesetatcode event directly using the directive, I would hope there is an event that gets triggered when the directive creates the polygon so that I can then get the polygons path and then add a listener to that, just like the code above.p  pI have put together a kbda hrefhttpjsfiddle.netg3v42fnc1 relnofollowJSFiddleakbd with the basic structure, along with the events object. It currently handles the polygons mouseover and mouseout, but not the codesetatcode event.p
Negative 364 pIm building a simple polls app with express.

However, this object also contains an array of voters which is a list of SessionIDs that have voted for each possible response. I do not want this to be part of the response.p  pI would basically like to return everything, except for the voters array. How can I filter my http response so it contains everything except the votersp
Negative 364 pI am trying to write a for loop that loops through an array of colors and calls another function which uses that array to change a button color.  p  pCurrently I have an array of three colors and I want the button to change to the first color then wait then turn back to white then change to the second color then wait then turn to white then change to the third color and wait and turn to white.p  pRight now I have two functions that change the color of the button then use setTimeout to wait 3 seconds before calling another function that changes the button back to white.p  pMy thought was to just run this sequence in a for loop that loops through the colors.  The for loop seems to be firing but not waiting for the setTimeouts to finish from the previous iteration before continuing.  I think I may need a callback but am not sure how to proceed.p  phtmlp  precodeltbodygt   ltbutton idbigButtongtChange Colorltbuttongt    ltscript srccode.jquery.comjquery1.11.2.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltbodygt codepre  pCSSp  precodebutton   backgroundcolor white  codepre  pJavascriptp  precodebigButton.onclick, function     var a[blue, green, red]     forvar m0 mlta.length m         turnOna[m]        var timerID  null function turnOn inputColor      bigButton.cssbackgroundcolor, inputColor     clearTimeout timerID     timerID  null     if timerID  null          timerID  setTimeout turnOff, 3000       function turnOff       bigButton.cssbackgroundcolor, white     clearTimeout timerID     timerID  null  codepre  pcodepen is a hrefhttpcodepen.iozoeamespenpvqBYZ relnofollowhereap

Negative 364 pThis is a pretty long question in words, but it all adds up to one function.p  pFor some time, I have tried figuring out how to increment a variable, save it and then display it. Only problem is I figured out that to save the variable and allow all users on the website to see the same updated variable, it has to be saved server side, so now I have a big question as I have tried to figure out one thing, and now has to do it another way.p  pTo store a variable server side, is it enough to save the variable in a .php script because if so, I think what I am looking for is a way to have a variable in a .php script, then when a specific function is called I want to increment this variable by one, and then last I want to save this variable server side, to always be able to have the exact same variable on all users screens. The .php script is called by a form from the html script, so there is no problem there, the problem is as mentioned above, how to make a variable in .php script, increment that variable when a function is called, save that variable and then pass it back to the html page to display. p

Negative 364 pOk, I realize that the question sounds ridiculous. Why would you wanna debug in release mode Im trying to implement an ILogger interface that when implemented, provides a facade for logging obviously. For the most part, that facade writes out to enterprise library  so it already has a Debug method with its own configuration. The problem is that I simply add Debug.WriteLinemsg line to the facade in addition to its normal behavior of writing out to a file, when I build it in Release mode, those debug statements dont get compiled with it so it wont write to the console when using that library from a different project, even if that project is built in debug.p  pWhat I would like is to set up this facade so that regardless of how it is built, all Logger.Debug messages will be output to the window and not just the file generated by MEL. Can I just set up the System.Diagnostics object to always compile, or is there a way to set up enterprise library to use the output as a configured listenerp

Negative 364   pHi everyone,p  pIm trying to create a plugin system using Python 2.7.6. I have a class which implements basic manipulation on a custom hardware board uses a C shared library, and Id like developers to be able to extend the functionality of this class using some sort of plugin system. For various reasons, all functionality should be available at the same level say, one class instance, so all function calls, explicitly implemented or imported from plugins, should be callable from the board instance. p  pAdditionally, the functions in these plugins need to use the functions defined in the calling class. For example, a channelisation plugin would need to use the read and write calls implemented in the Board class which imports it. Ive started with an abstract base class for the plugins as followsp  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodeclass FirmwareBlockobject      Abstract super class which must be used to implement firmware         block plugins to be used with the access layer       def initself          Class initialiser           Define class as an abstract class         metaclass  ABCMeta      abstractmethod     def initialiseself          Abstract method where all firmware block initialisation should be performed          pass      abstractmethod     def statuscheckself          Abstract method where all status checks should be performed          pass      abstractmethod     def cleanupself          Abstract method where all cleaning up should be performed when unloading firmware          pass codepre  pThe functions defined in this class must be implemented by all subclasses. In turn, subclasses can implement their own specific functions which must be included in the board class, for examplep  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodeclass ChanneliserBlockFirmwareBlock      def initialiseself         print ChanneliserBlock has been initialised         return True      def statuscheckself         print Checking status         return True      def cleanupself         print Performed cleanup         return True      def initialisechanneliserself, args, kwargs         value  1         writeRegisterregister1, value         if readRegisterregister1, value  value             return True         else             return False codepre  pThe board calling class then should be capable of loading in modules, inspecting custom functions and wrapping them so that they are callable directly from it. This is what I have till nowp  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodedef loadPluginself, plugin      Check if module is available     if plugin not in self.availablePlugins         print Module s is not available  plugin         return Error.Failure       Get list of class methods and remove those availale in superclass     methods  [name for name, mtype in                inspect.getmembersevalplugin, predicateinspect.ismethod                if name not in                [a for a, b in inspect.getmembersFirmwareBlock, predicateinspect.ismethod] ]       Create plugin instances     instance  globals[plugin]     self.dict[plugin]  instance       Import plugins function into this class     for method in methods          Link class method to function pointer         self.dict[method]  getattrinstance, method codepre  pThis should allow me to call plugin methods, however the plugins cannot access the functions defined in the board itself. I can, of course, pass the instance of the board to init when instantiating the class, however this tightly couples plugins with the board classes. I was wondering whether theres a better way to do this fro example, extracting the methods and attaching them directly to the board class, assuming no instance members are being usedp

Keep in mind that although Im working with pointers, arrays, and classes and more, I still dont fully understand what everything is doing, even having read through the book C Early Objects Eighth edition up to chapter 10. p  pHere is an example of the output which occurs, it shows that the score keeper is scoring correctly but the cards being placed in to the hand are starting to mess up in the fifth iteration of the loop which seems to be reflected in the score. p  pAC 2C 3C 4C 5C 6C 7C 8C 9C TC JC QC KCp  pAH 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H TH JH QH KHp  pAD 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D 8D 9D TD JD QD KDp  pAS 2S 3S 4S 5S 6S 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KSp  pAC  AC  1  11  0  0  1  1p  p2C  AC2C  3  13  0  0  2  1p  p3C  AC2C3C  6  16  0  0  3  1p  p4C  AC2C3C4C  10  20  0  0  4  1p  p5C  AC2C3C  AC  7  20  0  1  5  0p  pClearing handp  p6C  6C  6  6  0  0  1  1p  p7C  6C7C  13  13  0  0  2  1p  p8C  6C7C8C  21  21  0  0  3  1p  p9C  6C7C8C9C  30  30  1  0  4  1p  pTC  6C7C8C C6C  27  27  1  1  5  0p  p...there are several more here but I took them out because its the same issue over and over...p  pClearing handp  pQS  QS  10  10  0  0  1  1p  pKS  QSKS  20  20  0  0  2  1p  p...right here it crashes rather than finishing the hand...p  pand to make this a little more easy to read Ill tell you what each part separated by colons represents on one linep  pthe firstnext card is shown  X0000000p  pshows whatever is in the hand  0X000000p  pthe score assuming any aces are ones  00X00000p  pthe score assuming the first ace in the hand is eleven and all others are one  000X0000p  pa bool to represent if the hand is bust  0000X000p  pa bool to represent a full hand  00000X00p  pThe number of cards in the hand  000000X0p  pA bool to determine if another card may be drawn 0000000Xp  pThe very top part is just showing all the card values that are possible and seems to work fine.

Negative 364 pIm using the Cassandra file system a HDFS compatible distributed FS on top of Cassandra to store relatively large file 10 to 40 GB each. I do so using Sqoop to import data from a rdbms. Using Sqoop implies a map job to import data. I use two map jobs spread on two workers which results in my file being split in two  filenamepart001 and filenamepart002. File 001 being created by worker 1 and 002 by worker 2. Now up to here everything is fine. Then I try to access and cache these files in memory with Spark. Spark should consider data locality which is again fine, but when I look at the RDD distribution I see that one spark worker has in memory 13 of the data and the 23 are on the other worker, which maps with the 00x file size according to hadoop fs ls. So I really wonder how CFS manage block file spreading across the cluster. It actally looks like to me the data blocks corresponding to the 001 file are one node and the 002 file blocks on another node, but in this particular case that is with sqoop import, the data is not evenly distributed across my two nodes and I may create hot spots p  pHas anyone encounter this kind of issue with CFS  I couldnt find really how this is handled since I cannot understand whats the partition key of a single block in cassandra and if it uses a Random sharder or the ordering one.  p

Negative 364 pIm writing a class a Huffman encoder, if youre curious that needs to contain a specialized binary tree for which an STL container wasnt directly appropriate.  And its no problem to define a codeTreeNodecode structure with some leftright pointers and build the thing.  The questions I have concern the allocation of the nodes themselves.p  pI thought it would be really nice if I used an STL container as my allocator, rather than directly calling codenewcode for each node.  This was attractive because it would make destruction trivial I wouldnt have to walk my tree in the destructor to individually codedeletecode all the nodes the stock destructor for the STL container Id used as my allocator would do it automatically.p  pMy first choice of an allocator was codestdvectorltTreeNodegtcode. But this didnt work at all, because of course as the vector grows, it has to reallocate itself and that invalidates all my pointers. So what Im doing for the moment is clinging to the codestdvectorcode idea and abandoning the pointers every place I used to have a pointer I have an integer holding an index into my vector instead. That is, in my parent class I have members likep  precodestdvectorltTreeNodegt heap         all nodes in tree int root                           index into heap codepre  pAnd then to allocate a new node I do something like thisp  precodeTreeNode newnodewhatever nodei  heap.size heap.pushbacknewnode  now do something with nodei codepre  pAnd in fact this is all working just fine, except working with indices instead of pointers is a plain nuisance.  Everywhere Id normally reference a pointedto node as codenodepcode I have to use codeheap[nodei]code instead.  But, again, it works thats not the problem.p  pMy questions arep  ol liIs there an STL container class that is guaranteed not to have its elements move around later, such that pointers to them will remain valid for the containers lifetimeli liAre pointers to elements within STL containers ever a good ideali liWould it be better to use iterators or references instead of pointers for this sort of thing that is, to point to the elements in the containerized heapli liIs there a better way to implement a local heap allocator, with easy i.e. implicit destruction semanticsli ol  pIm open to other ideas, although I should warn you that Im pretty conservative.  Id like to stick with something that works in baseline C, i.e. Ill shy away from something thats only in C11 or something.  And Im especially leery of the overhead and complexity of packages like sigc and boost, so Ill be unlikely to want to use one of their special containers or allocators, either.p

Negative 364 pI followed the example for creating google endpoints, and I can see that they work properly in the apis explorer. I then generated the C library using the googleapisclientgenerator python script, and after a bit of tweaking it builds properly. Does anyone have a sample C project that utilizes the generated library Thanks.p
Negative 364 pIm a bit new here amp also new with VB. I have 2 workbooks. In WB 1 some data are there. Now I need to copy those data to WB 2. But not all of them. In srcsht there are 9 columns. In destsht there are only 5. Plus based on column 4 in srcsht i.e. Region, i need to copy the data for only East amp not the rest, which is there at destsht in column 2. Another thing is as i enter more rows in srcsht, the same should be increased in destsht too.p

Negative 364 pI want to loop over a list in Python and remove particular items.  I dont want to make a new list of accepted items, because in my complete example, I want to make a series of refinements to my list. Here is a simple example, in which I try to remove all numbers that are less than 3 in a list.p  precodeexample  [1.,2.,3.,4.,5.,6.] for e in example   if e lt 3.     print Removing, e     example.removee   else     print Accepting, e print NAIVE, example   Removing 1.0 Accepting 3.0 Accepting 4.0 Accepting 5.0 Accepting 6.0 NAIVE [2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0] codepre  pIt fails. I think it fails because the removal of an item in a list messes with the indices that the for loop is running over, i.e. once the item code1.code is removed, the item code2.code is at place 0 in the list, but by that time, the loop is at place 1.p  pI can fix this with codedeepcopycode as followsp  precodeexample  [1.,2.,3.,4.,5.,6.] import copy for e in copy.deepcopyexample   if e lt 3.     print Removing, e     example.removee   else     print Accepting, e print DEEPCOPY,  example  Removing 1.0 Removing 2.0 Accepting 3.0 Accepting 4.0 Accepting 5.0 Accepting 6.0 DEEPCOPY [3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0] codepre  pThis works here, but is it good practice Will result in other unexpected bugs Is there a better way to achieve this or is this construction looping and removing from a list fundamentally unsoundp  pI dont want to make a new list of accepted items because I want to apply a series of criteria to my list, one by one, and remove items accordingly. I dont want a new list for each criteria I apply which could be many and I dont want to apply all my criteria in one go either because its helpful to see how many items are removed by each criteria etc.p

Negative 364 pI have created the following code See below to handle my requests to cassandra. The Session and MappingManager Objects are quite heavy and we only want to initialize one of each for the application lifetime.p  pThe Mappers and Accessors, should also be initialised only once. My understanding is, that this works as a Prepared statement, that will be used for the lifetime of the application.p  pThis works as i want, as long as there is a connection to the Cassandra database. However if there is no connection at the time the CassandraConnector used the first time, the LazyHolder is in some kind of Error state. This results in the following Exceptionp  blockquote   pjava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError Could not initialize class   com.company.core.data.cassandra.CassandraConnectorLazyHolderp blockquote  pIf this happens there is something very wrong, and the application will throw an Exception.

Negative 364 pWhile am looking into the FEQs of Angularjs Ive seen below articlep  pstrongrootScope exists, but it can be used for evilstrong Scopes in Angular form a hierarchy, prototypally inheriting from a root scope at the top of the tree. Usually this can be ignored, since most views have a controller, and therefore a scope, of their own.p  pOccasionally there are pieces of data that you want to make global to the whole app. For these, you can inject rootScope and set values on it like any other scope. Since the scopes inherit from the root scope, these values will be available to the expressions attached to directives like ngshow just like values on your local scope.p  pOf course, global state sucks and you should use rootScope sparingly, like you would hopefully use with global variables in any language. In particular, dont use it for code, only data. If youre tempted to put a function on rootScope, its almost always better to put it in a service that can be injected where its needed, and more easily tested.p  pConversely, dont create a service whose only purpose in life is to store and return bits of data. p  pstrongSo My doubt is why rootScope is not recommended for functions as a global function Is there any performance issuestrongp

Although I can write this udf as a subquery in where clause in calling stored proc but can I use join to get min limit value for given client and instrument and null combinations in stored proc itself so that I dont have to call udf I want to join table IncomingTradecontains client, instrument and tradevalue and TradeLimitcontains client, instrument, limittype and limitvaluep  pstrongusing Microsoft sql server 2012strongp

Negative 364 pI have a media PC Intel NUC that I would like to use both for media projector and work monitors. I have connected two monitors DELL U2410 to mini DisplayPorts and one projector to HDMI. The NUC is running Windows 7 Pro x64. Everything works fine, however when I want to watch a movie on projector via KODI app and switch off the two monitors with buttons, all the open windows from it jump in to projectors view. When those monitors are switched off, MS Windows disables them completely, including desktop space. This is due to feature not bug of DisplayPort being PnP device. One way to solve this would be to use converter cables from mDP to DVI for example, but this particular NUC, probably due to Intel i5 limitation, requires native displayports to work with three monitors if non native DP is used, only two monitors will work. So this is not an option, I have to use native DisplayPort.p  pSo I was attaching this the other way, via software. The idea is to force those two monitors to sleep. I have tried many existing applications and none were able to force them to sleep, and those that did, did not keep them asleep because probably KODI is keeping them alive. So scrap that. Since both monitors support data communication via DDCCI, I have found an example application, written on visual basic C. What I managed to do 1. Read monitors capabilities 2. Power off the selected monitors. Address 0xD6, command 0x04. All desktops remain active and windows stay in their place. Nice. 3. But was unable to bring it back on. Address 0xD6, command 0x01. Monitor does blink a DP symbol in the corner, so it receives the data, but says there is no signal from PC. I am also able to switch inputs, etc., but nothing brings it back up. I can get it back again only by switching monitor off and on via physical button, but that of course makes all my windows to jump around.p  pSo maybe there is a problem with Intel video drivers, for example it stops sending the video data How do I recover from this Is there some other way to achieve what I want, to disable both DP monitors, while leaving HDMI running and all windows to stay in placep  pMaybe other way to solve this issue would be on hardware side, via hotplug pin of DisplayPort According to VESAs standard, it requires a 3.3V signal to detect the monitor. If I permanently connect 3.3V to HotPlug pin, will PC see the monitor as always on, even though there is no live communicationp
Negative 364 pI have three different buttons for different purposes inserts amp deletes from a table, each one should handle a different value in POST. I managed to do it once with p  pemif request.method  POST and request.POST.getnameofbutton,   valueofbuttonemp  pBut when I use the same idea again for a different button it just doesnt work.
