Positive 25562 pMy page uses ASP VBScript to generate a div with bootstrap class alert upon successful SQL submission.  What I want to happen is this  Once a user submits the form and the alert div appears, then they click on the first input field of the form, I want the alert div to disappear.  I have a feeling the issue lies with p  pA. Referencing a div generated by ASP in JQuery B. Referencing a div with multiple bootstrap classes C.

Positive 25562 pOK here is my situation. I have an address book type page lets call it addressbook.asp for an example, on this page new rows of addresses are added every so often, this page also has a search function that can search through an address table and narrow the view. My application also has another topframe.asp page that is the same for every page. p  pWhat Im trying to do is implement a notification system. I want to input the address info I want and when an address record is inputted into my address table on addressbook.asp that matches Ill get a pop up notification. The tricky part is I want this notification check running regardless of what page Im on so I will be putting that function into topframe.asp. When a match is made, topframe.asp will create a pop up window saying there is a match and it will have a link back to addressbook.asp. p  pWhat I need to happen is when this link is clicked, the user is redirected to addressbook.asp and the table showing the addresses are narrowed down by the users search criteria. So I basically need to pass in the users criteria on the redirect through the link into the search form and somehow initiate submit so I can reuse addressbook.asps original search functionality. p  pI was thinking I could use window.opener approach however the page opening the pop up isnt addressbook.asp. Is there a way to use window.opener or is there another function thats similar that will allow me to pass info to a page that is not the pop up windows parentp  pI think the simplified version of this is I need to be able to click my link, the link redirects to addressbook.asp, my table record is passed to the search form and basically search needs to be clicked. p

Positive 25562 pThis is more of an ethical question than a technical question.p  pIts very obvious why codeEvalcode and codeExecutecode are dangerous if you allow userdefined datavariables to get passed through them. However, Ive always gotten the vibe that the use of these functions is frowned upon no matter what and are only to be used as a last resort.p  pAnyway, Ive used them here and there when it can make coding more efficient and dynamic... but I always make sure I know that what gets passed through the functions are controlled and not userdefined. Would you consider this bad coding Is there a way a hacker could take advantage of those functions even if its not reading anything defined by codeRequestcode or codeSessioncode variables or any other userdefined datap

Positive 25562 pHow far down the a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiSeparationofconcerns relnofollowSeparation of Concernsa route can we go with Classic ASPp  pPresently, I try to minimise the use of Classic ASP in my markup pages by using codeIncludecodes and only embedding codelt gtcode codeResponse.Writescode in output attributes or inner HTML text e.g. codeltinput typetextgtlt myVal gtltinputgtcode.p  pOn rare occasions it does become necessary to use conditional statements to branch output, but I usually embed this as a call to a codeSubcode defined in the included ASP code.p  pThat is where things become a little more crazy, though. Im interested in seeing how others separate their markup when coding up a section of a form, or group of HTML controls, within a Classic ASP code file.p  pAs a simple example, lets say we have a function that simply displays a label and a text box on a form when the sub codeInputPaircode is called from the markupp  pre classlangvbs prettyprintoverridecodelt InputPair Forename, dsFormItemCCOLFORENAME, 0 gt codepre  pThe sub behind the call then needs to display the appropriate HTML markup elements, obviously a codelabelcode and codeinput typetextcode box.

I used a hrefhttpwww.dependencywalker.com relnofollowDependency Walkera to determine that Domain.dll depended on MSVBVM60.DLL so I grabbed both of these and moved them to the new server.

For instance, I tried to register dummy.dll and got the same error. Its like the system doesnt see the file. It autocompletes at the command line, but I cant register it. I also cant open it in Dependency Walker... the application says file not found.

I had a 32 bit DLL in the system32 folder which is a 64 bit only folder. Once I moved it to the SysWOW64 folder which is a 32 bit folder, go figure I was able to register it. I also unregistered MSVBVM60.DLL from system32 and found that it was already available in SysWOW64.p  pSo, this DLL issue is solved But Im getting the same error again due to a different include file. To be continued...p  pstrongUpdate 4strong The final include file error was indeed a missing include file.p
Positive 25562 pIm assigned the task of implementing session checking for a Classic ASP application. I dont want to include session checking on every single page. p  pId rather use something thats akin to a servlet or servlet filter in Java. The problem is I dont know of any implementation in Classic ASP which approximates this effect. Must I check for an existing session in each and every page or is there something I can do on an applicationwide level which will check the requestp  pI was thinking of creating a URL rewrite rule which forwards every request to a page which checks the session and either redirect if there is no session or forwards the user to the requested URL if a session exists. Any ideas or thoughts would be appreciated.p  pThank you. p

Negative 25562 pI was wondering  how do people handle importing large numbers of commonly used modules within django views And whats the best method to do this efficientlyp  pFor instance, Ive got some views like,p  precodeadminviews.py searchviews.py . . codepre  pand from what Ive seen, every one of them needs to use HttpResponse or other such commonly used modules. Moreover, some of them need things like BeautifulSoup, and others need other things md5, auth, et al.p  pWhat I did when starting the project was to make an codeincludeall.pycode which contained most of my common imports, and then added these specific things in the emviewem itself. So, I had something like,p  pstrongadminviews.pystrongp  precodefrom includeall import  ...  [list of specific module imports for admin] ... codepre  pstrongsearchviews.pystrong  p  precodefrom includeall import  ...  [list of specific module imports for search] ... codepre  pAs time progressed, the includeall became a misc file with anything being needed put into it  as a result, a number of views end up importing modules they dont need.p  pIs this going to affect efficiency That is, does python django import all the modules once and storecache them such that any other view needing them doesnt have to import it again Or is my method of calling this long file a very inefficient one  and I would be better of sticking to individually importing these modules in each viewp  pAre there any best practices for this sort of thing toop  pThanksp

Within those Public Folders is a [sub]folder that holds items of type Contact that has a bunch of distribution lists IPM.DistLists that have contact entries, members of the list essentially.p  pI need to get the addresses of the members of the lists in the Public Folder subfolder using any VB language, because the company I work for hired me as a VB guy and expects me to write VB solutions, even though I could do it in C... alas, I digress. VB is the language Im supposed to figure this out in. .net, script, vba, vb6, it doesnt matter which one. Yes, I know vb.net is not really related to those that came before, but they dont know that.p  pAnyone ran into anything like this Am I just not finding the IPM.DistList documentation but it does actually exist somewhere This isnt a Message.MAPIOBJECT iUnknown problem is itp  pThanks....p  pJeremyp

Negative 25562 pThis is more of a why do things work this way question rather than a I dont know how to do this question...p  pSo the gospel on pulling associated records that you know youre going to use is to use codeincludecode because youll get a join and avoid a whole bunch of extra queriesp  precodePost.allinclude gt comments codepre  pHowever when you look at the logs, theres no join happeningp  precodePost Load 3.7ms   SELECT  FROM posts Comment Load 0.2ms   SELECT comments.

The only way I can get a join is to use codejoinscode instead of codeincludecodep  precodePost.alljoins gt comments codepre  pAnd the logs showp  precodePost Load 6.0ms  SELECT posts.

Seems like it would be better to have one joined query instead of 6 individuals. I know that performancewise its not always better to do a join rather than individual queries in fact if youre going by time spent, it looks like the two individual queries above are faster than the join, but after all the docs Ive been reading Im surprised to see codeincludecode not working as advertised.p  pMaybe Rails emisem cognizant of the performance issue and doesnt join except in certain casesp

Negative 25562 pGreetings to all the smart people around herep  pId like to ask whether it is feasible or a good idea at all to deploy a Java enterprise web application to a Cloud such as Amazon EC2. More exactly, Im looking for infrastructure options for an application that shall handle few hundred users with long but neither CPU nor memory intensive sessions. Im considering dedicated servers, virtual private servers VPSs and EC2. Ive noticed that there is a project called JBoss Cloud so people are working on enabling such a deployment, on the other hand it doesnt seem to be mature yet and Im not sure that the cloud is ready for this kind of applications, which differs from the typical cloudbased applications like Twitter. Would you recommend to deploy it to the cloud What are the pros and consp  pThe application is a Java EE 5 web application whose main function is to enable users to compose their own customized Product by combining the available Parts. It uses stateless and stateful session beans and JPA for persistence of entities to a RDBMS and fetches information about Parts from the companys inventory system via a web service. Aside of external users its used also by few internal ones, who are authenticated against the companys LDAP. The application should handle around 300400 concurrent users building their product and should be reasonably scalable and available though these qualities are only of a medium importance at this stage.p  pIve proposed an architecture consisting of a firewall FW and load balancer supporting sticky sessions and https in the Cloud this would be replaced with EC2s Elastic Load Balancing service and FW on the app. servers, in a physical architecture the loadbalancer would be a HW, then two physical clustered application servers combined with web servers so that if one fails, a user doesnt loose hisher long built product and finally a database server. The DB server would need a slave backup instance that can replace the master instance if it fails. This should provide reasonable availability and fault tolerance and provide good scalability as long as a single RDBMS can keep with the load, which should be OK for quite a while because most of the operations are done in the memory using a stateful bean and only occasionally stored or retrieved from the DB and the amount of data is low too. A problematic part could be the dependency on the remote inventory system webservice but with good caching of its outputs in the application it should be OK too.p  pUnfortunately Ive only vague idea of the system resources memory size, number and speed of CPUscores that such an average Java EE application for few hundred users needs. My rough and mostly unfounded estimate based on actual Amazon offerings is that 1.7GB and a single, 2core modern CPU with speed around 2.5GHz the HighCPU Medium Instance should be sufficient for any of the two application servers since we can handle higher load by provisioning more of them. Alternatively I would consider using the Large instance 64b, 7.5GB RAM, 2 cores at 1GHzp  pSo my question is whether such a deployment to the cloud is technically and financially feasible or whether dedicatedVPS servers would be a better option and whether there are some realworld experiences with something similar.p  pThank you very much Jakub Holyp  pPS Ive found the a hrefhttpwww.citytechinc.comcontentdamcitytechincpdfCITYTECHJBossEAPAmazonEC2CaseStudy.pdfJBoss EAP in a Cloud Case Studya that shows that it is possible to deploy a realworld Java EE application to the EC2 cloud but unfortunately therere no details regarding topology, instance types, or anything p

And sometimes Application hangs and we need a thread dump. p  pWeve tried strongjstackstrong but it doesnt work in our env we found out that its Java6 only compatible.p  pSo we made a C app that calls thread dump via .dll call method attaching to the Java app process, and because of this it needs Local Admin rights, that is not so good. p  pSo wed like other options that works without admin rights and works with Java 5 without lots of rework of existing code.p  pMethod with Printing in LOOP thread dumps codeThread.getAllStackTracescode is not an option because we need to refactor lots of applications in order to make it work. p  pSo that just an util that works from outside of applications would be a best option.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 25562 pIm working on ui tabs built using jQuery. Everything works except for one issue  I did a setInterval that runs a function that does a triggerclick so that it goes to the next tab after 5000 miliseconds. It runs through each tab fine, the issue is that if the user manually clicks on a tab, the timer for the setInterval does not restart back at 0. For example if a user were to start on tab1 at 0 miliseconds and clicks on tab2 at 2000 miliseconds, the setInterval doesnt go back to 0, it would start at 2000 and run to 5000 miliseconds and would subsequently goto tab3. I understand why its happening, I just wonder if there were a way to restart the setInterval timing without having to do a clearInterval and creating an entirely new setInterval. Any insight would be appreciated.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThanks for the replies  The reason I was trying to avoid using clearInterval was because I was having issues of how to write the code in a way where the clearInterval would stop the setInterval completely. The code is setup to track whenever a user has clicked a tab. The problem is the auto change function utilizes triggerclick, so it runs the clearInterval function I wrote also when the tabs autochange. It seems to run fairly fine on its own, but once the user starts clicking on tabs, the setInterval behaves unusually and switches tabs unpredictably. I suspect what is happening is that several setIntervals are running at once... Heres the code If you havent guessed it already, Im pretty new at javascriptjquery. Ive commented out parts so that its functional, but it still doesnt function as I intended from first post.p  precode auto change tabs             if options.interval                    function timerCom                      if .controller.hasClasspaused                           var i  .tabcurrent gt a.attrrel                         alerti                         if i  3  i  0                         container                             .finda                             .eqi                             .triggerclick                                                            promoitems gt li gt a.clickfunction                       var timer                     if timer  null  clearIntervaltimer                     timer  setIntervaltimerCom, options.interval                                 codepre

Negative 25562 pI need to design a REST API for my project. It is needed for a twoway synchronization of a mobile application with a web application.p  pObviously, before starting, I have studied how other projects have implemented a similar scenario.p  pCommonly when the mobile app wants to get all the new items from the web application, it sends a starttimestamp in the request as a time reference.p  pI have found out that Plancake requires also an endtimestamp, in order to define a clear time window.

Negative 25562 pI was not able to find good answers in Google, or perhaps I am just missing the correct key words. Any help or suggetions are welcomep  pMy problem is the following I want to calculate the area a certain point cloud covers in 2D. I know that mathematically speaking the area is 0, but I am only able to take sample points out of the correct distribution. Additionally I do not have any information about the boundary of the point cloud, every shape is possible, including holes etc. So algorithms using the boundary of a manifold will not work. p  pSince the functions I am working with are smooth I can assume that the space in between points also belongs to the area I want to calculate. p  pAt the moment I divide the space into a lot of small boxes and count how many boxes are populated with one or more points. The count multiplied with the box size gives me an area. p  pIs there a more elegant solution to this Any ideasp  pThanks  Thomasp  hr  pEDITp  pWhat I do is projecting high dimensional points to a low dimensional embedding. I can determine the number of points in the high dimensional space and therefore also the number of points in the low dimensional space which form the area I want to calculate. If I increase the number of points it turns out that they are positionned between the old points, that is what I mean by smooth. Given a certain point I can assume that in some proximity around that point I will be able to find new points belonging to the area if I sample more dense. p  pAdditionally I have a threshold value at which I can consider two points to be equal, or in other words I know which resulution I want to achieve. p  hr  pEDIT 2p  pI use GPLVMs to do the mapping from high dimensional space to low dimensional space. So I think analysing that directly is two difficultnot possible. They are not very intuitive and I think in that case it is easier to work directly with the two dimensional points...p

I am not worried about server configuration or disk space at this time, as long as the database solution supports something of a cloud computing scenario.p  pIm thinking a NoSQL backend makes the most sense, storing the photos, galleries, and users as articles rather than rows.  NoSQL seems more capable of growing with a cloud. On the flipside, Flickr has been advertised as using MySQL ...p  pPerhaps this is a more existential question that a real coding question, but I know of no better group to askp

Negative 25562 pIm working on a JQuery Mobile project and Ive recently changed the way some data was displayed to use Templates I was sending them as a string of HTML.  The problem comes from the CSS not being added correctly to the classes... sometimes.  It happens more often in chrome than it does in firefox, so my guess is that it has something to do with the page loading before the CSS has a chance to be added.p  pBecause the project is set up so that the pages are divs that are hidden and shown one at a time for this part, reloadingrefreshing normally doesnt fix the problem.  The best way I can think of to make sure the information is loaded correctly is to somehow load the CSS to the classes after the data has been passed.p  pSome more information about how the project is set up.  There is a main page that is used for the basic navigation main.html then you click a link and it takes you to main.htmlDataPage.  When you click the links to go between pages, there are usually calls to another backend program that actually retrieves the data, then sends it to the page in json format.  A script takes that data and puts it into a template then puts it into a div on the page.  The classes that need to get the CSS are in the template in s if it matters.  There is a hardcoded template for the IT desk that has always worked, it is the small data set that was recently changed to using templates that doesnt get its CSS properly.p  pAny help or suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 25562 pOk. So I have a problem and the solution to this problem is just a little bit beyond my programming ability... Hopefully someone can help me. p  pI have a table with a div inside each cell. I need the div id to dynamically change whenever a row or a column is added to the table. The div ids snake around the table, so when a new row or column is added, the div ids have to change. The div ids are used in the javascript, so they have to dynamically change or the code wont work. p  pI created picture examples of everything, but since Im a new member I cant add them. Hopefully my text example below will help you to see what i mean...p  pbrbr 2X2 Table with div ids that snake back aroundp  p div id  1  div id  2 br  div id  4  div id  3 p  p2X3 table with a new column added with how the div ids need to lookp  p div id  1  div id  2  div id  3 br  div id  6  div id  5  div id  4 brBr Thank you so muchp  pAlso if you have another idea in mind of how this could work, let me know.

Negative 25562 pId like to ask some questions about optimizing linux socket. I try to make a multithreaded loadbalancer by using boost and simple linux socket. The loadbalancer works just as simple as these stepsp  ol liA request comes in and tcp listener will accept a socket, just say it strongclientSocketstrong and create a new thread li liWhen the thread start, it will create a backend socket, just say it strongserverSocketstrong to the back end server serviceli liAfter strongserverSocketstrong established, I spawn a new thread to read from strongserverSocketstrong and send the dataresponse to strongclientSocketstrongli liAnd for the main thread, I call a function that will read from strongclientSocketstrong and send to strongserverSocketstrongli liWhen one of those two sockets become invalid, the worker will close both sockets and diesli ol  pI also use Waitset from ting library, which is using epoll, to make the recv method in blocking mode, so that it will wait until theres an event occured and then read the data from the socket.p  pThe problem is when I tested the loadbalancer with AB, n 10000 c 100 k, the result is very disappointing. I only got 1600 tps. I tried to log request time taken for each request, but the result was good. Each roundtrip got lt 1000 microsecs1 milisecs. p  pBut when I log for incoming request intervals, next request processed about  5000 microsecs5 milisecs from current request received.

Negative 25562 pI have a situation where I want to run multiple EventMachines in Ruby  does anyone have experience with this I may write a test case to do it myself if not. Stay tuned.p  pLets be clear I want to instantiate two threads myself, and call codeEventMachine.runcode in both threads, so I really have two reactor loops.p  pThe reason why is that Im writing an asynchronous message bus with the AMQP gem, which uses EventMachine. Thats fine, but I want to make that a separate, modular component that can be used within two applications p  ul lione that has its own blocking gui loop that cannot be simulated by calling tick from EventMachine  it really blocks, and it does it in a C library, so I cant hack it. This one is simple  just start EM in its own thread, and share the incoming messages between loops in a threadsafe mannerli liand another application that emitselfem is running in a reactor loop, which I could potentially share with the AMQP code which is nice for thread safety issues  though I have to address them anyway for the above app. This is the one that got me thinking... could I share the message bus code with the above app by running two separate EventMachinesli ul  pAnybody have thoughtsp
Negative 25562 pI am planning on experimenting with realtime game development using html5 and node.js. I previously made a game using polling to simulate realtime updates in a game.  My realtime game would use AJAX to keep the game synchronized across multiple clients. Basically whenever a change in game state occurred, I would update a field lastupdated in the database row concerned. Whenever a client polled the server, it would check for any updates that occurred since its last poll returning any relevant updates doing this by comparing the previous poll time to the lastupdated fields.p  pIn my new version of the game where I instead use node.js and websockets I would like to avoid a mechanism like this where I have to continually do searches to a database to find if there were updates. I was wondering if there were alternative methods to storing important game state information, without the use of a database in this mannor.p  pI would really like to be able to setup events to fire on all clients when game state is changed instead of having to continually check for changes as this would save a large amount of processing  querying. I dont really know if an event fired on one client can be sent to other clients also connected to my node.js running server. I have always used a database for this sort of thing, but I am really hoping there are other better alternativesp  pCheers, Joshp

The actual situation is a serial COM port library a hrefhttpasyncfree.sourceforge.net relnofollowAsyncFreea that is thread based.  When the port is USBbased, the library seems to have a deadlock between two of the threads it creates on closing the port.  Ive already discussed this at length in a hrefhttpforum.madshi.netviewtopic.phpf4ampt27179ampsid2c3480e6405b2bb9b99bc5596a4caac0 relnofollowthis foruma.  I did recode one of the WaitForSingleObject calls to not be infinite, and that cured that deadlock, but then another one appeared later in the thread shutdown sequence, this time in the Delphi TThread.Destroy routine.p  pSo my rationale for this is simple  when my threads deadlock, I fix the code if I can.  If I cant, or one appears that I dont know about, I just want the thread to finish.  I doesnt have to be pretty.  I cant afford to have my app choke.p

Negative 25562 pIm trying to make some optimizations in a private video player for Linux aiming to improve performance because strongplaying MP4 files are heavy on the CPUstrong, since the strongvideo frames are encoded in YV12strong and OpenGL doesnt provide a native way to display this format. Right now theres a code that runs on the CPU to converts YV12 to RGB before the image is sent to the GPU for display, and this consumes 100 of CPU processing.p  pIm currently investigating stronghow to decode YV12 frames without having to write a shaderstrong to do the YV12  RGB conversion.

Negative 25562 pI want to implement a hash table in python. On the table a class object will be associated with the key value. The problem is I want to use the key value to find the index of the class and update it which of course is not a problem. But what can I do if I want to sort the table using a particular value of the class.p  pFor example, let us consider, we have three value documentid, score and rank. There is a class document which consists of score and rank. documentid will be the key of the table. p  pI want to update the score of various entries of the table, using the key documentid. But when updating of the scores are done, I want to sort the listtable using the score and assign rank value to the rank variable based on updated score.p  pCan someone kindly give me some guideline about how can I proceed Or maybe I should simply make it a list  p  pThe maximum number of item of the table might be upto 2500030000.p  pThanks. p

Negative 25562 pFirst, I must say that I have read several post about this at StackOverflow but I cannot get the desired result.p  pLet me explain the context simplified Im using LinqtoSQL to query customers with recent visits to the store and optionally get only those with certain amount of payments. Suppose I have a model with client, visits and payments classes.p  pSo, focusing on the codeWherecode expression, Im trying thisp  precodeExpressionltFuncltEntityes.Clients, boolgtgt filter  null  filter  c gt            c.Visits.Anyv gt v.VisitDate gt DateTime.Now.Date.AddMonthsintvisitsSince   if minPayment.HasValue ampamp minPayment.Value gt 0       filter.And                c gt c.Payments.Sump gt p.Quantity gt minPayment.Value  codepre  pThe codefilter.Andcode method is an extension method, recommended at this forum, below you can see the definitionp  precodepublic static ExpressionltFuncltT, boolgtgt AndltTgtthis ExpressionltFuncltT, boolgtgt expression1,                                             ExpressionltFuncltT, boolgtgt expression2    InvocationExpression invokedExpression        Expression.Invokeexpression2, expression1.Parameters.CastltExpressiongt    return Expression.LambdaltFuncltT, boolgtgt       Expression.Andexpression1.Body, invokedExpression, expression1.Parameters  codepre  pHowever, this doesnt work for me as expected and results are not filtered by payment amount. There is no error with data or linqtosql model because this code works finep  precodefilter  c gt             c.Visits.Anyv gt v.VisitDate gt DateTime.Now.Date.AddMonthsintvisitsSince              ampamp c gt c.Payments.Sump gt p.Quantity gt minPayment.Value codepre  pHowever, I dont want to use the last code because I have some more complex scenarios in which I need to build the filter expression stepbystep with an andor combination of each part.p  pPD Im a ADO.Net DataSets guy trying to learn LinqtoSQL and soon Entity Framework, I hope to be useful to the StackOverflow community soon.p
Negative 25562 pI have a problem with the autocomplete behaviour of comboboxes in VB.NET with the .NET framework 2.0.p  pI am using a combobox to type in emnumericem values, and its DropDown list to suggest possible emnumericem values. This list is sorted in ascending order, for example 10,92, 9000, 9001.p  pThe combobox properties are set as followp  ul liAutoCompleteMode SuggestAppendli liAutoCompleteSource ListItemsli liDropDownStyle DropDownli liSorted Falseli ul  pThe DropDown list is simply filled like thisp  ul limyCombobox.Items.Add10li limyCombobox.Items.Add92li limyCombobox.Items.Add9000li limyCombobox.Items.Add9001li ul  pWhen I dont type anything, the order of values of the DropDown list is correct, in originalascending order. However, when I start typing something, the suggested values in the DropDown list get sorted alphanumerically if I type 9, the list of suggestions becomes 9000, 9001, 92.p  pI would like to prevent this behaviour to get the values of the list in the originalascending order. I cant figure out how...p  pA possible workaround would be to pad with zeroes the values in the list, e.g. 0010, 0092, 9000, 9001 but I would like to avoid this.p  pEditp  pAs suggested by bendataclear, one can use a list box to display the suggestions. This will work for small lists but doesnt scale well to large lists. It may be useful for some applications. Based on the code given by bendataclear, I made it work this wayp  pcode Private Sub ComboBox1KeyUpsender As System.Object, e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs Handles ComboBox1.KeyUpp  precode    Dim cursorPos As Integer  ComboBox1.SelectionStart      ListBox1.Items.Clear      For Each s In ComboBox1.Items         If s.StartsWithComboBox1.Text Then             ListBox1.Items.Adds         End If     Next      If ListBox1.Items.Count gt 0 And ComboBox1.Text.Length gt 0 Then         ComboBox1.Text  ListBox1.Items0         ComboBox1.SelectionStart  cursorPos         ComboBox1.SelectionLength  0     End If  End Sub codepre  pcodep  pThe code has not been thoroughly tested and can be improved, but the main idea is there. p  pEdit 2 p  pUsing DataGridView leads to better performance it was sufficient for me. Thanks bendataclear.p  pJust out of curiosity, any other answer is welcomed p

Negative 25562 pIn C.NET, I like using HashSets because of their supposed O1 time complexity for lookups.  If I have a large set of data that is going to be queried, I often prefer using a HashSet to a List, since it has this time complexity.p  pWhat confuses me is the constructor for the HashSet, which takes IEqualityComparer as an argumentp  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb359100.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb359100.aspxap  pIn the link above, the remarks note that the constructor is an O1 operation, but if this is the case, I am curious if lookup is still O1.p  pIn particular, it seems to me that, if I were to write a Comparer to pass in to the constructor of a HashSet, whenever I perform a lookup, the Comparer code would have to be executed on every key to check to see if there was a match.  This would not be O1, but On.p  pDoes the implementation internally construct a lookup table as elements are added to the collectionp  pIn general, how might I ascertain information about complexity of .NET data structuresp

Negative 25562 pIm having a hard time wrapping my head around the bigO notation for a pairing operation. The question is pretty simple Generate all possible pairs for a given list of numbers in an array. p  pMy first guess is to have a nested forforeach loop and generate the pairs. This is easy enough and I get that for every n, I analyze n other numbers and this gives me a complexity of n2.p  pNow, if I try to optimize this further and say that 1,4 is the same as 4,1, then for a sorted array like 1,2,3,4,5. I only run the pairing operation in a nested for loop this wayp  precodefor i 0 i lt count i      for j  i  1 j lt count  1 j       codepre  pIn this case, I only run through the array lt n2 times. For a sample size of 7 numbers, i ran through the loop 21 times to generate the pairs. I know that this cannot be a logn operation and Im tempted to say that this operation converges to n2 but I dont remember enough from my math or theory classes to answer this definitively. How do I go about this problemp  pContext I had an interview with a similar question and this was born out of an argument I had with my friend if a pairing operation from a list can ever be better than n2. p

Negative 25562 pI have looked through many tutorials, as well as other question here on stack overflow, and the documentation and explanation are at minimum, just unexplained code. I would like to send a file that I already have zipped, and send it as an attachment. I have tried copy and pasting the code provided, but its not working, hence I cannot fix the problem. p  pSo what I am asking is if anyone knows who to explain how smtplib as well as email and MIME libraries work together to send a file, more specifically, how to do it with a zip file. Any help would be appreciated.p  pThis is the code that everyone refers top  precodeimport smtplib import zipfile import tempfile from email import encoders from email.message import Message from email.mime.base import MIMEBase from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart      def sendfilezippedthefile, recipients, senderyouyou.com     myzip  zipfile.ZipFilefile.zip, w       Create the message     themsg  MIMEMultipart     themsg[Subject]  File s  thefile     themsg[To]  , .joinrecipients     themsg[From]  sender     themsg.preamble  I am not using a MIMEaware mail reader.n     msg  MIMEBaseapplication, zip     msg.setpayloadzf.read     encoders.encodebase64msg     msg.addheaderContentDisposition, attachment,                 filenamethefile  .zip     themsg.attachmsg     themsg  themsg.asstring       send the message     smtp  smtplib.SMTP     smtp.connect     smtp.sendmailsender, recipients, themsg     smtp.close codepre  pI suspect the issue is this code zips a file as well. I dont want to zip anything as I already have a zipped file I would like to send. In either case, this code is poorly documented as well as the python libraries themselves as they provide no insight on anything past img file and text files.p  pUPDATE Error I am getting now.

Negative 25562 pQuestionp  pGiven a DOJO TreeGrid, how can I capture the event when a user clicks the expando  button to expand a row, and store the specific row number or associated items identifier  Id like to do this for the express purpose of completely deleting the TreeGrid from the DOM, rebuilding it, and restoring its state once rebuilt i.e. programmatically expanding the rows that the user has previously expanded.p  pBackgroundp  pSo Ive got a custom DOJO TreeGrid, hooked up to a custom QueryReadStore, in my app.  It was constructed using the following tutorial p  pa hrefhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworksweblibrarywadojotreegridindex.htmlcadrs relnofollowhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworksweblibrarywadojotreegridindex.htmlcadrsap  pPretty interesting tutorial, but it might be irrelevant to my question because it doesnt really squash any functionality, it only seems to augment it.p  pAnyway, googling around for a moment, I found a nice function in the DOJO forums that I can use to programmatically expand a row, given the specific row index.  Works perfectly.p  pThe problem is that I havent been able to find a good way to capture the expando click event, and relate it to a specific parent item row index in the grid.  p  pDetails aside, Id like to get the row index of every row that the user has expanded, into an array and delete the index of a row that the user collapses, obviously, so I can destroy this TreeGrid, and faithfully rebuild it, with the users selections expanded properly.p  pIm not really a novice to DOJO, but Im certainly no expert by any means.  Ive done a fair bit of googling, and FireBugging, and havent really been able to find anything that I can use to do this.p  pSuggestions  Anybody done something similar before  Stupid question with obvious answer that Ive missed  Im totally misguided and am going about it all wrong  Thanks everybodyp

Negative 25562 pWhen starting out a new project, there are lot of changes in models that I find it easy to edit an existing migration amp run codedbcleancode or codedbresetcode than create a new migration.

Instead, you should write a new migration that   performs the changes you require.

Negative 25562 pAs in the title, I am currently dealing with the need to parse an XML formatted String while being able to store information about the character index of the start of an element tag and the end of an element tag within the original String. Ive looked at SAX and DOM and I cant seem to find anything that would provide me that data. Any suggestionsp  pThanks.p
Negative 25562 pIve run into issues preserving the alpha channels of surfaces being copiedclip blitted blitting sections of a surface onto a smaller surface, theyre spritesheets. Ive tried various solutions, but the end result is that any surface thats supposed to have transparency ends up becoming fully opaque alpha mask becomes white.p  pSo my question is, how does one copy one RGBA SDLSurface to another new surface also RGBA, including the alpha channel And if its any different, how does one copy a section of an RGBA surface, to a new RGBA surface the same size of the clipped portion of the source surface, ala tilesheet blitting.p  pIt seems that SDLBlitSurface blends the alpha channels, so when for example, I want to copy a tile from my tilesheet surface to a new surface which is of course, blank, Im assuming SDL fills surfaces with black or white by default, it ends up losing its alpha mask, so that when that tile is finally blitted to the screen, it doesnt blend with whatever is on the screen.p  pSDLDisplayFormatAlpha works great to copy surfaces with an alpha mask, but it doesnt take clip parameters, its only intended to copy the entire surface, not a portion of it, hence my problem.p

I am using the java.sql.time to store the data.p  precodelong timeInMillis  43200000 This is 12 hours in milliseconds.     Time time  new TimetimeInMillis codepre  pFor whatever reason this is giving me a time of 070000 and it should be 120000. Im assuming this is because when setting a time variable it is based on the amount of time past a specific date. strongHow do I set a time variable without actually using a predefined datestrongp  pThe reason I am doing this is because I want to store a week day and a time range in a database.

I want to be able to compare an actual date value against the database and see if the date falls between the time periods based on the dates day of week regardless of the month or year. Storing full dates in the database for each possible weekday and time would result in thousands of unnecessary entries.p

It was the printers I was using two totally different printers Canon and HP  models notwithstanding  I felt that I had enough coverage to rule out the printer, but there is more to this problem  Continue reading...p  pReportLab doesnt actually draw the line, it just adds a postscript line that tells the render to draw the line.p  pPart of my initial debugging included changing the colors I was using to see if that was an issue  well  I changed the colors from pink to red not much of a change, I know, but again, I emassumedem I changed it enough to rule out colors as an issue.p  pWell from what I have recently, and painfully learned, is that the printers convert colors to grayscale using a formula and that formula has a tendency to produce antialiasing sideeffects like what I was seeing.  p  pTHE SOLUTION  was to change the colors of the grid.  Certain colors perform better than others.  So, to test this, I wrote a simple script which you can a hrefhttpwww.jrcresearch.netdownloadsprinttest.txt relnofollowdownload herea that will generate a PDF document using all of the colors stored in reportlabs colors dictionary  print a sample grid that was causing me the problems and provide the RGB values.  As it turns out, alllllllll sorts of colors dont print well across several printers all different  its not just redspinks... some redlike colors print fine, some printers handle the grayscale conversion better than another.  p  pSo now, our task is to use this PDF document I created to find a color that looks fine in print both color and grayscale and on the screen.  p  pIf you dont want to download the script for fear Im evil  at least check out the PDF and print your own samples to see if you can recreate the problem I was having I was printing at 600dpi  standard  nothing fancy... remember, if I turned up the DPIquality settings, it printed fine, but the standard settings were causing me grief.p  pa hrefhttpwww.jrcresearch.netdownloadsprinttest.txt relnofollowScriptap  por p  pa hrefhttpwww.jrcresearch.netdownloadsgridprint.pdf relnofollowPDFap

Negative 25562 pIm writing a simple program in C that finds anagrams of words based on looking them up in a hash table. What I have is an array of hash tables, where words are indexed by their length and hashed within by the summation of their letters, e.g. a  1, b  2, etc. p  pIm still getting acquainted with dynamic memory management in C, so this question may be quite simple, but I have a functions that allocate and deallocate memory for each hash table and its inside data. p  pI originally wrote this program using a single hash table and after running the program through valgrind I found that the memory had been freed correctly and there were no leaks. However, when expanding the program to use an array of hash tables, valgrind began to find possible leaks though its reporting them as still reachable. Im confused as to why the memory isnt being freed correctly in the array of hash tables, although each hash table in the array is being run through the deallocate function that was used originally. p  pGist with the full code a hrefhttpsgist.github.com4559692 relnofollowFull Codeap  precodetypedef struct Bucket Bucket typedef struct HashTable HashTable  struct Bucket    char data   Bucket next   struct HashTable    int size   Bucket buckets   int mainint argc, char const argv[]      Allocate memory for array of hash tables   HashTable hasharray  HashTable mallocsizeofHashTable  WORDSIZE   fori  0 i lt WORDSIZE i      hashallocamphasharray[i], BUCKETCOUNT        Main logic here...

Is there an easier alternative I tried adding custom meta fields to attachment but cannot get it to display under my images in a post.p  pI dont understand why this is not built into wordpress. This is so crucial for the web.p

Negative 25562 pI have a web page hosted on jetty server. The page displays some static images, the images directory are kept inside a jar, say application.jar. This application.jar is packaged inside a onejar. I am facing problem in accessing the images directory as they are inside a jar which is inside another jar. I have tried almost all the ways to get URL of the images directory class.getClassLoader.getResource, Thread.currenctThread.getContextClassLoader.getResource, ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader.getResource, etc. None of them is of any help. I wrote all these statements, i.e. tried to get access to the images directory, from a class that is inside the application.jar. This jar contains the images directory too.p  pIf anybody has ever faced this before, please reply to this thread. I am open to any other ideas also that may help me achieve the objective.p

Im still investigating, but it looks like SharedPreferences and perhaps other things are messed up.  My question is really this.  What does downloading via Eclipse do that simply launching from the device itself does not do  Is there a way to duplicate a clean start like Eclipse does  I tried clear data and clear cache in the same menu that Force Stop is.p  pI realize this is a broad question.

Which would not be the case if I would just put it into an .js file and link to it.p  pMy workaround was now to put all JS code in a php file whith a Session check at the beginning followed by the JS code.p  precodeltphp sessionstart  SESSION[loggedIn]    die gt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt          jQuerydocument.readyfunction        Start configuration         jQuerymenu.tabify     ... codepre  pAnd then include this withp  precodeltphp includeoncejsscript.func.php  gt codepre  pIs this the way you would do it, or is there are better solution means prevent opening security holes or errors.p  pkind regards,p  ptonyp

Negative 25562 pI am developing an educational iPad app, Im finally done with the code and its ready to submit but I just found about the Reduce FullScreen Transitions rule. p  pstrongFor iPad Reduce FullScreen Transitions Closely associate visual transitions with the content thats changing. Instead of swapping in a whole new screen when some embedded information changes, try to update only the areas of the UI that need it. As a general rule, transition individual views and objects, not the screen. In most cases, flipping the entire screen is not recommended. When you perform fewer fullscreen transitions, your iPad app has greater visual stability, which helps people keep track of where they are in their task. You can use UI elements such as split view and popover to lessen the need for fullscreen transitions.strongp  pThe guidelines basically say that its not recommended it doesnt say it prohibited. So if the app is build based on the fullscreen transitions since its a training app with three section each have 4 full screen transitions. Do you think that I should recode the whole thing because it would be rejected Or 4 fullscreen transitions for 3 buttons is not too muchp  pthanks in advance p
Negative 25562 pWhen researching How do I detect a touch event on a moving UIImageView Ive come across several answers and I tried to implement them to my app.  Nothing Ive come across seems to work.  Ill explain what Im trying to do then post my code.  Any thoughts, suggestions, comments or answers are appreciatedp  pMy app has several cards floating across the screen from left to right.  These cards are various colors and the object of the game is the drag the cards down to their similarly colored corresponding container.  If the user doesnt touch and drag the cards fast enough, the cards will simply drift off the screen and points will be lost.  The more cards contained in the correct containers, the better the score. p  pIve written code using core animation to have my cards float from the left to right.  This works.  However when attempting to touch a card and drag it toward its container, it isnt correctly detecting that Im touching the UIImageView of the card.  p  pTo test if my Im properly implementing the code to move a card, Ive also written some code allows movement for a nonmoving card.  In this case my touch is being detected and acting accordingly. p  pWhy can I only interact with stationary cards  After researching this quite a bit it seems that the codep  precode optionsUIViewAnimationOptionAllowUserInteraction codepre  pis the key ingredient to get my moving UIImages to be detected.  However I tried this doesnt seem to have any effect.  p  pI another key thing that I may be doing wrong is not properly utilizing the correct presentation layer.

I have a virtual server on the University network where I am hosting my PHP based application, so it obviously doesnt have its own mail serverSMTP settings.p  pSo, if I were to send out mails from a university network, I guess I should request the network admin for the SMTP settings for the university mail network and then use PEAR for it rightp  pI need to confirm this because its kind of a big deal to make a request like that, and I myself have never used PHP to send mails from an external email id not linked to the server.p  pAre there any alternatives to thisp

Using the suggested solution, I used the following ajax eventsp  precodeltrichpickList          varitem         valuesomeBean.selectedItemsgt     lta4jajax eventsourceblur rendersomePanelGroupWithTheButton gt     lta4jajax eventtargetblur rendersomePanelGroupWithTheButton gt ltrichpickListgt codepre  pThis works. However, the event is fired each time the source or target list is blurred, which is too frequently for my needs.p  pI also tried codelta4jajax eventadditems gtcode and codelta4jajax eventremoveitems gtcode. In this case, the event is fired only on removal or adding items, exactly like I want. However, codeselectedItemscode isnt populated with the new item until after the event has been fired. This means I cannot use it to rerender the button, since the list will be empty after adding the first item, and having size one after adding the second element.p  pIs there an ajax event to listen for that fires after the target list codeselectedItemscode has been updated emand there must be a complete list of supported ajax events for this component somewhere, rightemp  pemI also tried the change event, as suggested a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7678838howtoknowwhichitemisclickedinrichfacespicklistherea, but it is not fired.emp

Negative 25562 pI created a very simple login test in Behat to login to our internal application. There are two login types done from the same screen and box. There is basic and advanced. The only difference is that in advanced the user that is logging in has access to more than one company and is asked to pick a company to work on.p  pI find that whenever I run the scenarios through PhantomJS instead of Selenium they run a lot faster obviously since nothing has to be rendered in a headless browser emulator. When I first launch PhantomJS it runs both scenarios just fine. But then I run it a second time and it fails the first scenario the basic login.p  pIf I restart PhantomJS it works again until the second try. I am very confused by this. Why is it that I need to restart PhantomJS to get both tests to pass again on the first call.p  pIf I specify that I just want it to run the advanced login on subsequent runs then it fails that login as well. If I specify the basic login still preventing it from running both scenarios it fails this as well. But when I run both scenarios in the same call the first one always fails and the second one always passes.p  pI even switched the order so that basic is run second instead of first and the first scenario in this case advanced fails and the second passes. So what in the world is going onp  pAs an extra bonus I went ahead and added a line that reads Then I follow Log Out and all the sudden both scenarios pass again. Which would make sense if it werent for the fact that it works fine during the second scenario. Shouldnt it fail both if it is already logged in Is there a way to make sure that the cache for PhantomJS is cleared at the end of each scenariop  precodeFeature Login     Login to app using a basic user     Login to app using a multicompany user      javascript     Scenario Basic Login         Given I am on          And I wait a few seconds         When I fill in login with ijones         And I fill in password with SomePssword         And I press LoginButton         And I wait a few seconds         Then I should see By clicking below         And I press OK         Then I should see Welcome      javascript     Scenario Advanced Login         Given I am on          When I fill in login with rtyler         And I fill in password with SomePssword         And I press LoginButton         Then I wait for the company selection box         And I click a field company         And I pick Test Company 2         And I press CompanyLoginButton         Then I should see By clicking below         And I press OK         Then I should see Welcome codepre

Negative 25562 pI have to create a script ksh or perl that starts certain number of parallel jobs another scripts, each of them runs as a foreground process in a separate session. Plus I start monitoring job that has to determine if any of those scripts is expecting input from operator, and switch to the corresponding session if necessary. My problem is that I have not found a good way to determine that process is expecting input. For the background process its pretty easy process state is stopped and this can be easily checked with ps command. In case of foreground process this does not work. So far I tried to attach to the process with dbx or truss to see if its hanging on read, but this approach seems too heavyweight. Could you suggest some better solution Perl, shell, C, Java, etc.  is ok as long as its standard and does not require extra 3rd party or OSspecific stuff to install.p  pThank you.p

Likewise the other points appear to be  being plotted a month ahead of where they should be.p  pI have used codeordinal falsecode to allow for irregular date intervals, which is a feature of highstock.p  pWhat is the reason for this and how can I solve itp  pEditp  pMy date in each datapoint is produced from php like sop  precodeecho n[Date.UTC . dateY, m, d, strtotimedate . ,  . value . ] codepre  pI know I could have several php codedatecode functions to decrement the month myself but Id hope thered be a more efficient way. E.g. is it possible to replicate the javascript codeDate.UTCcode method in php and just output the big number no. of milliseconds since 01011970 straight offp

Negative 25562 pEven though the two APIs are at different levels of the stack, both CALayers shouldRasterize and UIViews drawRect achieve the same goal  render the bitmap and cache it for future reuse. In both cases, the cached versions are invalidated if the viewlayer needs redrawn.

Negative 25562 pSo I have been looking into this for a few weeks and have come up with nothingp  pI work on the website for my families music store, and have been asked to add a Links page to the website. My goal would be to have the categories of our vendors i.e. Violin, Guitar, Piano, etc. on the left of the page and when the category is selected the links come up on the right. That part I have. The tricky part here is When a link to a vendor i.e. Fender, GampL, Yahmaha is clicked instead of taking them directly to the site, I want it to take them all to the same page, but embeded on that page is the site.p  pI have done a lot of research on this and have come up with nothing. I could just go through and make a new page for each of the vendors, with the embedding on each individual page, but that is extremely time consuming with the amount of vendors.p  pIs something like this at all possible Ive been playing with embedding itself and have that down. It just comes down to, which link did they click, and loading that specific page.p  pIf there is any more information you may need to help or point me in the right direction please let me know Same with any code that may be helpful p  pIve come up dead on all my research on this.p  pEDIT I guess my ultimate goal is that it will look something like this a hrefhttpanswers.yahoo.com relnofollowhttpanswers.yahoo.coma so that the vendors website is open on bottom, but our stores banner and links are still at the top.

Negative 25562 pI understand that if you construct a LINQ query and append it with code.ToListcode you are executing that LINQ query there and then and returning a list object.

Negative 25562 pI have been reading the book Spring in Action for a few weeks now to learn about the spring framework. I have about 2 years of programming experience mostly in java with some distractions here and there in Ruby and Python.p  pAfter reading the first few chapters, I didnt quite get what the big deal is about dependency injection in spring. I was expecting a AHAAA moment but didnt quite experience that yet. Im sure Im missing something important.p  pWhy would I want to wire my beans in xml rather than instantiating them the good old way with the code new myclasscodep  pI understand I can wire beans in the xml via constructor args and properties as well as configure datasources in spring so that I can hide away connection details in an xml file. But  why There is more to this especially when it comes to good software design. Can some one explain the big dealp

Negative 25562 pIm trying to do a 3D rotation in CSS3 on a parent container...e.g. webkittransform rotateY30deg, but reverse the rotation on children e.g. webkittransform rotateY30deg.

However, Im having problems with the codetext.usetex  Truecode option. In particular, its irritating that the tick labels default to a serif font when all my figures should be sansserif.

Negative 25562 pI have a web game in which an alliance can have multiple members. This is represented by a foreign key field on each members class seeing as a member can only be part of one alliance.p  pIve been getting weird instances of worlds and alliances being deleted. I narrowed it down to where I was sure the worlds were getting deleted only because the alliances were, so I removed the cascade deletion. However, I still cannot figure out for the life of me emwhyem the alliances are being deleted in the first place.p  pI overrode the custom delete method like sop  precodeclass Alliancemodels.Model     ...     def deleteself, args, kwargs         mail.sendmailAlliance Deletion, s has been deleted.              self.alliancename, fromemail.com, [toemail.com]         superAlliance, self.deleteargs, kwargs codepre  pHowever, at least one alliance has been deleted where I did not get an email sent to me. I gather this is because I must be calling delete from a QuerySet, but I have been over my code with a finetoothed comb and there is precisely one occasion where I call delete on any alliance instance, and its not over a QuerySet.p  pIs there a way to track down what is causing this, or to find out what function has executed the delete of an objectp
Negative 25562 pIm using ASP.NetVB.  The problem is that I have some floating DIVs that make you want to hit back in your browser to close the floating DIV instead of clicking close.p  pMy idea is that when you click a button on the page to open a form in a floating DIV, it adds a browser history entry for  if the most recent history isnt already .  When you close the form on the floating DIV, delete the browser history for  that we added.  If the user accidentally hits back while the form is displayed, they should remain on the page because it should try to go to .  The form itself would disappear, and if the user hit back in the browser again, it would just work just fine.p  pIf you know this is possible, let me know and I can figure out how to do it myself, I just dont want to spend too much time attempting to do something thats not possible.p

Negative 25562 pI am trying to develop an equation parser in python with eventually sub formulas. The idea is that a user might give an equation whose variables are not all known. But some subformulas might be defined for these undefined variables. The program should then replace the unknown variable by the sub formula. Using the help provided by ebarr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22422843parsinganequationwithsubformulasinpythonherea, I have further developed the idea but I fail due to a stupid issue when replace a variable by a subformula, ast.parse always deletes the right and left parenthesis which gives a bad final formula.

Negative 25562 pIm currently working on a project where I have a dictionary list of words of the english language. I use this list to figure out if a user has inputted a valid word. The whole list is rather lengthy, were talking about 100k of Strings, but I have partitioned the list into smaller bits. These files are stored as xml files and are accessed by the assetmanager. I use the parser as such to open the filep  pdocument  documentBuilder.parsexmlFilep  pThe document is a Document object using the library org.w3c.dom.Documentp  pSo the problem is that this actually slows down the app A LOT, even with the smaller partitioned files in fact initially I just had one file with all the 100k Strings and it crashed the app immediately. So should I use text files instead Or instead of using the assetmanager should I store my data in resources Or any other way to optimize speed for that matter Im open to any suggestions.p

On Friday 411 at 800 am, with the first received record of the day, the increment jumped to 3997, a jump of 1,000.p  pIs this something I need to be concerned about Is it an anomaly of SQL Server that occasionally happens Or could there be something in my VB 2010 server program that is cutting loose and trying to write to the databasep  pAs far as my system is concerned, a gap in the record numbers doesnt matter as long as the system doesnt try to go back and fill them in out of sequence.p  pIm pretty sure that it cant be attributed to hacking or other malicious intent, because each transaction between the iPhone and the server program is recorded in log files and theres no indication that any activity occurred in that interval.p  pAny ideas about thisp  pThanksp

Negative 25562 pI am compiling a hello world program in C on a 64bit Linux machine. I am using a GCC ARM embedded toolchain to cross compile my program on a FOX G20 V board with an ATMEL AT91SAM9G20 processor. p  pOn the first take, I had a few errors when compiling because the program didnt recognize the printf, return etc. functions the standard C functions. So I decided to make the link between the functions, which I believe are defined in the libc.a library correct me if Im wrong, by doing codearmnoneeabigcc o hello hello.c libc.acode but the outcome still results in errors p  precodelibc.alibaexit.o In function exit exit.c.text.exit0x16 undefined reference to exit libc.alibasbrkr.o In function sbrkr sbrkr.c.text.sbrkr0xc undefined reference to sbrk libc.alibawriter.o In function writer writer.c.text.writer0x10 undefined reference to write libc.alibacloser.o In function closer closer.c.text.closer0xc undefined reference to close libc.alibafstatr.o In function fstatr fstatr.c.text.fstatr0xe undefined reference to fstat libc.alibaisattyr.o In function isattyr isattyr.c.text.isattyr0xc undefined reference to isatty libc.alibalseekr.o In function lseekr lseekr.c.text.lseekr0x10 undefined reference to lseek libc.alibareadr.o In function readr readr.c.text.readr0x10 undefined reference to read collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status codepre  pIm really unsure as to why the program still does not recognize the standard functions even though Ive linked the library to the application.

Negative 25562 pWeve had some performance issues recently so Ive been monitoring our activity more closely. Ive been running the AskBrent scripts and get reports someone ran DBCC FREEPROCCACHE because the plan cache was very young. Delving further using dmexecquerystats I see the plan cache keeps emptying as frequently as every few seconds. Ive run a trace on the server and nothing is running any DBCC commands during the same period.p  pAnyone know what else could cause the plan cache to empty so frequentlyp  pThe database supports a number of busy websites in production. In our staging environment running the same code the plan cache is days old. In our dev environment the cache is between a few minutes or a few hours old, which isnt as surprising. Were running SQL Server 2008 R2 Standard in a cluster.p
Negative 25562 pWere using SpecRun as our test runner, whose logfile TeamCity consumes.p  pWeve encountered a problem whereby a test in SpecRun will fail the first time due to resources not warming up quickly enough, then pass the second retry we have the SpecRun Default.srprofile setting to run up to three timesp  pHowever, TeamCity treats this as a failure after reading the log, when in fact its really not.  Of course, we want to prevent any retries in SpecRun but in the meantime dont want to falseflag test runs in TeamCity.p  pWould anyone know of a way, either in SpecRun or TeamCity or a combination, to have a test that was retried successfully to be marked as a pass in TCp

Negative 25562 pIm just starting out with MonoMac in Xamarin Studio, and Ive run into the strangest problemp  pI a window with an NSButton and a NSTextField on it.  By this point Ive cut out the event handler on the button, so it doesnt DO anything, except highlight when I click it.  The button creation code looks like thisp  precodensButton  new NSButtonnew System.Drawing.RectangleF0, 0, 100, 100 nsButton.BezelStyle  NSBezelStyle.RoundRect nsButton.Font  NSFont.SystemFontOfSize     NSFont.SystemFontSizeForControlSizeNSControlSize.Regular nsButton.StringValue  text codepre  p...and then it gets added to the window like sop  precodensView.AddSubviewcontrol.Handle as NSView codepre  pbecause in this part of the code, control.Handle is typed as object, and nsView is the main view on the window.p  pAll runs and works fine at first.  But, if I click repeatedly on that button, eventually the window just closes.  No error, no exception, and the app itself doesnt quit menus continue to respond and cheerfully log messages when I use them.  But the window is simply  gone.p  pIts extremely repeatable it happens after 21 clicks.  If I add an event handler that updates the NSTextField e.g. hello.CaptionFoo, then it happens after 19 clicks.  It doesnt matter whether I click fast or slow its always the same number of clicks.  Note that there is no code in the project to close the window, and the window doesnt even have a close box I know of no legitimate way to close it short of quitting the app.p  pI am baffled here, and dont know how to debug this further.  Does Xamarin have some sort of evaluation limit that closes your windows after somany events  Is it a framework bug  Any insight will be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 25562 pAfter nearly six hours of trial and error, I am unable to come up with a solution for my problem  I have built this before, but lack access to old files to see what I did, and have been in a different career path for years now and unfortunately my skill has faded a bit. p  pI am setting up a website to chronicle my time at sea for work, and it will have  a header that is 150px tall and 100 wide  a nav bar that is 30px tall and 100 wide  an aside that is 250px wide and stretches fully between the nav bar and footer, regardless of how little content there is in it  an article div, that will be to the right of the aside that fills the remaining space left over depending on how wide the viewport is  a footer that is at least to the bottom of the page if the content does not fill the viewport, or if the text flows beyond the limits of the viewport, it will be below that. I do not want an always visible footer. p  pI am using HTML5 and CSS3 along with ASP.net 4.5. p  pI currently have the header, navigation, and article working the way I want. However, I am not sure how to approach the aside and footer. p  pI want the footer to be at the bottom of the page. Obviously, if I have a page without much text on it, it will be halfway up the browser screen, and that, as we all know, looks amateur and ridiculous. So I would like it to be at the bottom of the screen, like a normal webpage. And while I am at it, I would also like my aside to fill the 250px wide strip on the left hand of the browser window regardless of how much content is in it too, all the way to the footer so it looks more complete. p  pNow, as I pointed out, for the last six hours I have been plugging away and have made some serious headway with this, but these two issues I just cant seem to get ironed out. I have used this forum for help, and have exhausted nearly everything without success. Its frustrating to know I have done this numerous times before in just a few minutes, but here I am at 4 am. p  pHere is the CSSp  precode           margin 0  body       margin 0px auto     height 100   form, html      height 100   header      margin 0px auto      backgroundcolor 1041a2     backgroundimage url..ImagesheaderHCJ.png     backgroundrepeat norepeat     backgroundpositionx right     height 150px     position relative   logo      margin 0px auto     float left     height 150px     width 150px     backgroundimage url..ImagesusmmSeal130.png     backgroundrepeat norepeat     backgroundposition center    title      margin 0px auto     color white     position absolute     bottom 45px     paddingleft 150px   title h1      margin 0px auto     fontfamily Arial     textshadow 5px 5px 5px black   title h2      margin 0px auto     fontfamily Arial     textshadow 5px 5px 5px black   nav      backgroundimage url..Imagesnav.png     fontfamily Arial     color white     backgroundrepeat repeatx     height 30px     width 100     lineheight 30px     margin 0px auto    content       margin 0px auto     height 100   aside       margin 180px 0px 80px 0px auto     float left     width 250px     backgroundcolor gray     height 100   article      margin 0px auto     paddingleft 250px     minheight 100   footer      height80px     background black     clear both  codepre  pand here is my HTMLp  precodeltbodygt     ltform idform1 runatservergt         ltheadergt             ltdiv idlogogt             ltdivgt             ltdiv idtitlegt              ltdivgt         ltheadergt         ltnavgt          ltnavgt         ltdiv idcontentgt             ltasidegt                 Vessel data             ltasidegt             ltarticlegt                 ltaspContentPlaceHolder IDContentPlaceHolder1 runatservergt                 ltaspContentPlaceHoldergt             ltarticlegt         ltdivgt         ltfootergt          ltfootergt     ltformgt ltbodygt codepre  pp  pThank you all so much for your feedback. p  pEDIT I am very close to a solution. I have modified my code so that the aside and article are contained in a div, and set the aside to minheight of 100, after making changes to the form, html, and body elements. It now is expanded to 100 percent of the viewport, with one problem. It LITERALLY is 100 the height of the viewport RATHER than 100 of the height of the container div. The headernav bar occupy 180px at the top of the page, and the footer occupies 80px at the bottom. The page will scroll 240 px regardless of the size of the viewport. My initial fix for that was to add margin 180px 0px 80px 0px auto. This however, did not solve the problem. Code above is edited to reflect changes. p

Negative 25562 pI am using Cocos2d v2.1.  I subclassed CCSprite and have overwritten the draw method.  I am calling [super draw] so everything with regard to the sprite itself is drawing correctly.p  pAll I want to do at this point is use the draw method to place a red dot directly at the sprites position.  In short, this red dot should appear at the center point of the sprite.  I am using the ccDrawSolidCircle function.  p  pWell, the dot is being drawn, but it is not aligned with the sprite.  As I move the sprite around the screen the dot moves with it.  The further away I am from position 0,0 the further the dot moves away from the sprite.  When I move the sprite to position 0,0 the dot is correctly placed.  p  pSince it was moving this way I assumed this had to do with points versus pixels, thus I multiplied the position of the dot by .5.  This brought the dot closer, but the behavior continued.  I then tried using the convertToNodeSpace and convertToWorldSpace functions, but none of this worked.  But maybe there is some combination of these methods that would work.  Who knows.  p  pI have never had to worry about the coordinates when overriding the draw method of a CCNode subclassed object, but for CCSprite it does not work the same.  This is probably because the draw method of CCNode is empty. p  pThere is probably a simple solution to this, and probably related to openGL coordinates versus cocos2d coordinates, but I am unable to determine this nor can I find something in the various forums.  Any help would be appreciated.p  pThanksp  pEDIT 1 Well, I found something that works, but whether this is the best solution I do not know.

Negative 25562 pthis is a more unusual question so give me a hint when stack overflow isnt the right place for it. p  pI have a problem with Visualstion 2012 where it freezes every so often when I compile my project.  I am currently working on a Qt project so the Qt addin is installed. I am sure you cant remotefix my problem but I would like to ask what could cause such freezes.p  pHere are some important infosp  ul lithe PC doenst freeze every time I compile seems to be a bit randomli lithe freeze takes from 5 to 15 minutes. In most cases, it ends with the screen switching to black and then back to normalli liI often try to open the task manager which returns an exit code after the freeze which says that the task manager couldnt startli lithe PC comes back to life after 515 minutes but many applications incl VS arent responding for additional 5 minutes.li lithe hardware components are fine for what I can tell. I tested HDD and RAM, temps are fineli ul  pI hope you can give me a hint where the cause of the freezes could be hiding.  p

If no globally defined codedcode exists, then a codeobject not foundcode message is returned The big question is now how do I make the codedcode argument to the function used instead of the globally defined codedcodep  pI was under the impression that the following should workp  precode      myfun2 lt functiondf, d           here lt environment           new.dat lt ddplydf, .id, transform, xxwithhere,d            returnnew.dat       myfun2df, 1 codepre  pIt is my understanding that codewithhere, dcode retrieves the object codedcode from the environment codeherecode. So, the result should be code1code. An error is returned, though, saying p  precode  Error in evalsubstituteexpr, data, enclos  parent.frame      invalid envir argument of type closure  codepre  pI am not sure I understand why this does not work, and I would be happy if anyone could shed some light on this, or if you could provide alternative solutions. Note that wrapping the entire codeddplycodestatement into codewith...code does not seem to help either.p  pA solution that does work is to codeattachcode the current environment inside the functionp  precode myfun3 lt functiondf, d    here lt environment    attachhere    new.dat lt ddplydf, .id, transform, xxd     detachhere    returnnew.dat   codepre  pbut I dont like this solution since it works by masking the globally defined codedcode with the local codedcode, which I think is not very elegant.p  pAny comments  pointers are appreciated.p
Negative 25562 pIve created a struct and the struct has a metric on it. I am generating a series of these structs and I want to sort them into an array based on this metric. Basically, if the metric is 0, I want it in the list in the [0] slot of the array, if the metric is 14, I want it in the list in the [14] slot of the array. The bound on the metric size of the array is variable based on the same variable that the structs are generated off of, so I need the array to be declared dynamically with malloc. Ive been experimenting with how to get this array of lists of my struct. I cant figure it out. Ive googled the problem and havent been able to come up with a solution.p  pAlso, once I have the array, how do I add another element to the list of a particular array cell And then go back through and compare all elements of the list in the i th cell to the elements of the nith cellp  pEdit It may also help that not all of the metrics will have elements.p  pEdit 2 Ive tried this and it seems to have some problems.p  precodelistltspairgt pairs pairs  listltspairgt mallocsizeoflistltspairgt  N  1  j   a, b  pairs[m].pushbackj codepre  pwhere m is the metric for j which is of type spair.

As soon as I click outside all polygons, I return to drawmodify mode.p  pI did the naive test  that of adding an codeol.interaction.Selectcode to the interactions of the drawmodify Map instance  which lead to hilarious results  For example, upon finishing the drawing of a polygon i.e. when I doubleclick to close it its also getting selected... and clicking anywhere inside or outside polygons just starts another new polygon edge, it never selects a preexisting one  etc.p  pMy only thought of a solution so far is... for me to implement a VI emulation   i.e. a command mode that is, the selectmodify state and an insert mode i.e. the drawmodify state  and you chose what mode you are in from a state toggle button inside the map custom OL3 control or outside the map normal HTML button .p  pI am, however, looking for a better way, like the one I suggested with holding Ctrl...p  pAny ideassuggestions most welcome.p

Negative 25562 pApple rejected an app of mine that offers inapp purchases but does not have a restore purchases button included. I am familiar with the inapp purchases policy and I know that this button is mandatory. However, I wrote my app in a way that every time it starts it will check for previous purchases and restore them automatically if needed. So even if the user lost his device and loaded up the app on a new device, once he would log in, all what he purchased before will be restored right away automatically So a restore button will be meaningless as the app does it automatically. p  pIn the resolution center I wrote Apple back with a request to rereview my app as it does not need the restore button and I explained why. Now, as we all know, every process with the app review team might take few days, so I am wondering what would be the best next step in order to shorten the review processp  ol liShould I wait for their response with hope that they will understand my case and approve my app without the restore button considering what I just explainedli liShould I just add this button regardless and submit a new binaryli ol  pThanks Roy.p

Negative 25562 pI am trying to implement Asp.Net Identity 2.0. I have managed so far very well with the help of a hrefhttptypecastexception.compost20140622ASPNETIdentity20CustomizingUsersandRoles.aspx relnofollow titlethis blogthis bloga. But I went a slightly different road. I want some data not to be part of the User object, but rather of a newly created Customer object. I want to keep the authentication and authorization data separate from my business data. p  pSo in my case I modified the ApplicationUser class by adding a customer propertyp  precode    public Customer Customer  get set  codepre  pThe Customer class looks like thisp  precodepublic class Customer      public int Id  get set      public string FirstName  get set      public string LastName  get set      public string Insertion  get set      public Gender Gender  get set      public DateTime Birthdate  get set      ...etc.     public virtual ApplicationUser User  get set   codepre  pI also added the relationship in de the ApplicationDbContextp  precode    protected override void OnModelCreatingDbModelBuilder modelBuilder              modelBuilder.EntityltCustomergt             .HasRequiredu gt u.User         base.OnModelCreatingmodelBuilder       codepre  pSo now after some modifications to the register viewmodel and the controller I am able to register as a user and have both a User record created in the AspNetUsers table and a Customer record in the Customer table with a reference to the User record. So far so good.p  pBut now when I retrieve the user for example for display purposes the Customer property is empty. Which makes sense, since the underlying record is not loaded. Normally I would use the .Include keyword to load the related records. But I dont know how to do that when using the default UserManager that comes with Asp.Net identity 2.0.p  pDoes anybody know how to achieve thisp

Negative 25562 pSuppose I need to execute emNem tasks in the same thread. The tasks may sometimes need some values from an external storage. I have no idea in advance which task may need such a value and when. It is much faster to fetch emMem values in one go rather than the same emMem values in emMem queries to the external storage.p  pNote that emI cannot expect cooperation from tasks themselves, they can be concidered as nothing more than java.lang.Runnable objectsem.p  pNow, the ideal procedure, as I see it, would look likep  ol liExecute all tasks in a loop. If a task requests an external value, remember this, emsuspendem  the task and switch to the next one.li liFetch the values requested at the previous step, all at once.li liRemove all completed task suspended ones dont count as completed.li liIf there are still tasks left, go to step 1, but instead of executing a task, emcontinueem its execution from the suspended state.li ol  pAs far as I see, the only way to suspend and resume something would be to remove its related frames from JVM stack, store them somewhere, and later push them back onto the stack and let JVM continue.p  pstrongIs there any standard not involving hacking at lower level than JVM bytecode way to do thisstrongp  pOr can you maybe suggest another possible way to achieve this other than starting emNem threads or making tasks cooperate in some wayp
Negative 25562 pBasically, I need to keep track of a variable in a POS system. When you click an item at the top, it adds it to the list in an array pulled from a database, I need to set the tally at 1 ie 1 item added, and when you click to add the item again, it checks the array of items in the list, and if it is there it then adds one to the tally. I am unable to do this, and it just adds an item to an array, and then doesnt do anything after that.

If I try to edit it with above code, the modified file isnt recognized by the app and will be overwritten with its standardxml, resulting in a complete reset of the apps settings.p  pI already checked the filepermissions and set them identical to the sourcefile, but the app wont accept it. In the texteditor both versions of the file look exactly the same.p  pDo you experienced this issue somewhere before As it seems, both files are identical to each other. I cant find the reason why the app wont accept it. If you need more codesnippets, Ill be glad to post them.p  pAgain, apologies if this question has been answered before. In this case I would be very happy to get a link. p  pThanks in advancep  pEDIT Fixed a mistake in the xmlexample. Header werent included.p

Negative 25562 pI dont understand how to create my own subclass of codeSlotcode and use it in Pharo. The problem is that it looks like the slothandling code requires me to implement size and index but I have no idea what to put in there.p  pThe use case is the definition of a class that represents a configuration. A user can specify part of the configuration and relies on default values to specify the rest. To do that, I want to define a slot class that has 1 a default value 2 a dictionary. The idea is that when reading the slot, the dictionary is searched for a key that has the slots name. If a key is found, then the value of the slot is the value found in the dictionary. If no key is found in the dictionary, the value of the slot is the default value.p
Negative 25562 pVBA novice and first time poster here.  Sorry if I make any newbie mistakes.p  pIm a teacher and Im trying to make a Jeopardy game in Powerpoint.  Im trying to tackle the Daily Double wagering.  I want a slide that has the wager in a textbox, and can be adjusted by using either of TWO spinbuttons.  This is basically a COARSE and FINE adjustment.  I have the logic worked out, but I cant seem to change the .Value properties of the spinbuttons using VBA.

Invalid property value.  At first I thought this was a Data Type mismatch, so I tried using various CInt and CStr commands to try and find a match, to no avail.  Other experiments trying to set the .Value of a spinbutton have all failed.  I tried using the .ControlFormat object, but I suspect that only works for Excel, not PPT.  Any insight you all have would be appreciated.  If you dont want to address my specific problem, general advice about how to set the value of a spin button with VBA in powerpoint would be helpful, too.  Thanksp
Negative 25562 pI am using karmacoverage to measure the unit test coverage in my project and everything works in that regard just fine.

Negative 25562 pIm writing an OpenGLCUDA 6.5 interop application. I get a compile time error trying to write a floating point value to an OpenGL texture through a surface reference in my CUDA kernel. p  pHere I give a high level description of how I set up the interop, but I am successfully reading from my texture in my CUDA kernel, so I believe this is done correctly. I have an OpenGL texture declared with p  precodeglTexImage2DGLTEXTURERECTANGLEARB, 0, GLRGB32FARB, 512, 512, 0, GLRGB, GLFLOAT, NULL codepre  pAfter creating the texture I call codecudaGraphicsGLRegisterImagecode with codecudaGraphicsRegisterFlagsSurfaceLoadStorecode set. Before running my CUDA kernel, I unbind the texture and call codecudaGraphicsMapResourcescode on the codecudaGraphicsResourcecode pointers obtained from codecudaGraphicsGLRegisterImagecode. Then I get a codecudaArraycode from codecudaGraphicsSubResourceGetMappedArraycode, create an appropriate resource descriptor for the array, and call codecudaCreateSurfaceObjectcode to get a pointer to a codecudaSurfaceObjecttcode. I then call codecudaMemcpycode with codecudaMemcpyHostToDevicecode to copy the codecudaSurfaceObjecttcode to a buffer on the device allocated by codecudaMalloccode.p  pIn my CUDA kernel I can read from the surface reference with something like this, and I have verified that this works as expected.p  precodeglobal void cudaKernelcudaSurfaceObjectt tex      int x  blockIdx.xblockDim.x  threadIdx.x     int y  blockIdx.yblockDim.y  threadIdx.y     float4 sample  surf2Dreadltfloat4gttex, intsizeoffloat4x, y, cudaBoundaryModeClamp codepre  pIn the kernel I want to modify sample and write it back to the texture.

Negative 25562 pI use C switch based on a variable I set according to which GTK Combo Box Text entry is selected  variable  3 lt  case 3 ... etc. . There are 4 entries. My trouble is getting the 2nd and 3rd entries to actually do something.p  pOnly the first and last entries seem to carry the variable value properly.p  pI have tested it repeatedly, seeing if I need to use ifelse rather than a switch, to no avail. It is probably more than a coincidence, though, that the middle two entries are ignored in the program. Right now, I am using 4 ifelse statements. There is the same behaviour, however, with switch only the first and last entries cause the program to do something, which, in my case, is cause a dialog box to show and then, upon clicking, launch a terminal window showing progress.p  pPlease, please, help is much appreciated.p  pThanks.p  pP.S.

Negative 25562 pI am currently designing around a big memory index structure several giga bytes. The index is actually a RTree which leafes are BTrees dont ask. It supports a special query and pushes it to the logical limit. p  pSince those nodes are soley search nodes I ask my self how to best make it parallel. p  pI know of six solutions so farp  ol lipBlock reads when a write is scheduled. The tree is completely blocked until the last read is finished and then the write is performed and after the write the tree can yet again used for multiple reads. reads need no locking.pli lipClone Nodes to change and reuse existing nodes including leafs and switch between both by simply yet again stop reads switch and done. Since leaf pointers must be altered also the leaf pointers might become their own collection making it possible to switch modifications atomar and changes can be redo to a second version to avoid copy of the pointer on each insert.pli lipUse independent copies of the index like double buffering. Update one copy of the index, switch it. Once noone reads the old index, alter this index in the same way. This way the change can be done without blocking existing reads. If another insert hits the tree in a reasonable amount of time these changes can also be done.pli lipUse a serial share nothing architecture so each search thread has its own copy. Since a thread can only alter its tree after a single read is performed, this would be also lock free and simple. Due reads are spread evenly for each worker thread being bound to a certain core, the throughput would not be harmed.pli lipUse write  read locks for each node being about to be written and do only block a subtree during write. This would involve additional operations against the tree since splitting and merging would propagate upwards and therefore require a repass of the insert since expanding locks upwards parentwise would introduce the chance of a deadlock. Since Split and Merge are not that frequent if you have a higher page size, this would also be a good way. Actually currently my BTree implementation currently uses a similar mechanism by spliting a node and reinsert the value unless no split is needed which is not optimal but more simple.pli lipUse double buffer for each node like the shadow cache for databases where each page is switched between two versions. So everytime a node is modified a copy is modified and once a read is issued the old versions are used or the new one. Each node gets a version number and the version that is more close to the active version latest change is choosen. To switch between to version, one needs only an atomar change on the root information. This way the tree can be altered and used. This swith can be done every time but it must be ensured that no read is using the old version when overriding the new one. This method has the possibility to not interfer with cache locality in order to link leafs and alike. But it also requires twice the amount of memory since a back buffer must be present but saves allocation time and might be good for a high frequency of changes.pli ol  pWith all that thoughts what is best I know it depends but what is done in the wild If there are 10 read threads or even more and being blocked by a single write operation I guess this is nothing I really want. p  pAlso how about L3, L2 and L1 cache and in scenarios with multiple CPUs Any issues on that The beauty of the double buffering is the chance that those reads hitting the old version are still working with the correct cache version.p  pThe version of creating a fresh copy of a node is quite not appealing. So what is meet in the wild of todays database landscapesp  p[update]p  pBy rereading the post, I wonder if using the write locks for split and merge would be better suited by creating replacement nodes since for a split and a merge I need to copy somewhat the half of elements around, those operations are very rare and so actually copy a node completely would do the trick by replacing this node in the parent node which is a simple and fast operation. This way the actual blocks for reads would be very limited and since we create copies anyway, the blocking only happens when the new nodes are replaced. Since during those access leafs may not be altered it is unimportant since the information density has not changed. But again this needs for every access of a node a increment and decrement of a read lock and checking for intended write locks. This all is overhead and this all is blocking further reads.p  p[Update2]p  pSolution 7. currently favoredp  pCurrently we favor a double buffer for the internal nonleaf nodes and use something similar to row locking.p  pOur logical tables that we try to decompose using those index structure which is all a index does results in using algebra of sets on those information. I noticed that this algebra of sets is linear Omn for intersection and union and gives us the chance to lock each entry being part of such operation. p  pBy double buffering the internal nodes which is not hard to implement nor does it cost much about lt1 memory overhead we can live problem free on that issue not blocking too much read operations. p  pSince we batch modifications in a certain way it is very rarely seen that a given column is updated but once it is, it takes more time since those modifications might go in the thousands for this single entry.p  pSo the goal is to alter the algebra of sets used to simply intersect those columns being currently modified later on. Since only one column is modified at a time such operation would only block once. And for everyone currently reading it, the write operation has to wait. And guess what, once a write operation waits, it usually lets another write operation of another column taking place that is not bussy. We calculate the propability of such a block to be very very low. So we dont need to care. p  pThe locking mechanism is done using check for write, check for write intention, add read, check for write again and procced with the read. So there is no explicit object locking. We access fixed areas of bytes and if the structure is clear everything critical is planed to move into a c version to make it somewhat faster 2x we guess and this only takes one person one or two weeks to do especially if you use a Java to C translator.p  pThe only effect that is now also important might be the caching issue since it invalidates L1 caches and maybe L2 too. So we plan to collect all modifications on such a table  index to be scheduled to run within 1 or more minutes timeshare but be evenly distributed to not make a system that has performance hickhups.p  pIf you know of anything that helps us please go ahead.p

Negative 25562 pHi to all friendly automagicians,p  pIm using ansible in order to administrate tasks on a heap of embedded linux nodes that are rapidly expanding. Since our project is using hipchat, I figured its necessary to start notifying to a room so I dont keep annoying researchers by rebooting or something when working on a node.p  pI have divided the hosts inventory up into child groups based on their switch ports and vlans.  So when I want to do something to all production, I dont use use the limit option..  When I want to do something to a specific chain of nodes, I limit to a child group.. and when I want to do something individually I limit to the hostname.p  pSo I am using a notify at the end of a task to post to hipchat like sop  precode name Notify hipchat      hipchatv2       msg inventoryhostname  was updated from  version.stdout  to  newversion.stdout  codepre  pThe problem is when I go to do an action like system wide updates in batches of child groups its going result in a message for each node to the room which will mean hundreds over a couple of hours, so in this case Id rather output the name of the child group.p  pHowever I still want to maintain the ability to notify room of the same action performed on an individual host.p  pThats where my question comes inp  pIs there a way I can configure the playbook to use a conditional test in order to output an individual host name if the action is limited to a single host name like Im doing with  inventory hostname , yet only output the name of the child group if the action is limited to a child group insteadp  pSo in a logical flow strongyes I know this isnt real code  just code logicstrong, something likep  precodeIf limit option  group then print group elif limit option  groupresearchnodes then print researchnodes elif limit option  individual host then print hostname fi codepre

Negative 25562 pUsing the CFLDAP tag in ColdFusion I can successfully retrieve someones distinguidedName and manager attributes with a filter like thisp  precodeampobjectcategorypersonobjectclassusermailtim.testnls.uk codepre  pThis reveals values such as these for the distinguidedName and manager attributesp  precodedistinguishedName CNTest, Tim,OUDev,OUIS,OUResources,OUStaff,DCnatlib1,DCnls,DCuk  manager CNTest, Sue,OUDev,OUIS,OUResources,OUStaff,DCnatlib1,DCnls,DCuk codepre  pWhat I want to do next is find everyone else managed by Sue Test.

Negative 25562 pI have been trying to think more about what abstraction actually means in functional programming. The very best post I have found that talks the type of language I can understand is the following a hrefhttppchiusano.blogspot.se201009fourstagesoffunctionalprogramming.html relnofollow4 abstractionsa. However since Im a wannabe Clojure programmer Im wondering what sort of abstractions macros provide. It seems that they fit in stage 2 together with HOF but at the same time they are more then a HOF. I find stage 3 to be related to the Expression problem and would be protocol and multi methods in Clojure. So my question is p  pWhen implementing a macro in a Lisp language what would you say you are abstracting overp  pWhat would stage 3 and 4 be in a Lisp languagep

For this I use the stylesp  precodeposition relative top 50 transform translate3d0, 50, 0 codepre  pUnfortunately CSS animations using transform interfere with my vertical align technique. I could rewrite the animation so that it used translate3d with a 50 Y value, but the problem with doing this is that I dont want to force the content to be vertically centered on small screen sizes.p  pThe solution I came up with was using Javascript to detect the screensize, then determine whether to add the .slideInLeft animation, or the .slideInLeftVC animation .translate3d0px, 50, 0. This technique of applying the right animations on load time may work in many cases, but it doesnt seem to be the best solution. For example, if a user resized their window after loading the page, they would get the wrong animation. I was wondering if anyone knew any good techniques for working with multiple transforms.p

Negative 25562 pGday When I know the slope and yintercept of a line, I need to calculate an xvalue that is 1 unit out from the line. For example, if pointA  4,5, and I set a line going from it with 0 slope and therefore 5 as the yintercept, then the x value I want would be 5. If the slope were undefined vertical, then the x value would be 4. And so on.p  pSo far, I calculate x as codex  mpoint[0]1bcode.

I wrap codeBudgetGBPcode around codeLTRIMRTRIM ...code construct.  And things matchedp  pI did a bit of codegooglingcode and found that codeLTRIMRTRIMcode basically rounds off the float to code32269.2code. That might be the reason why they match.p  pSo, to summarize, my strongfirststrong question is why the codeEXCEPTcode gives a row in result when the records are matchingp  pMy strongsecondstrong question might be simple. As you can see, I am restricted to use the clause codebudgetgbp gt 32269code in codeWHEREcode clause. Reason is when I provide the exact valuewhich I am copying from SSMS, I get no results. Please let me know what I am doing wrong here. p  pstrongEDITstrong   Is there any way the data validation might work There are 100s of table in the database and it is next to impossible for me to scavenge for float columsn and wrap them around cast. Using EXCEPT is one ways of validating the data in development environment.p

Typically, no further snapshots for that record will exist in the data. Occasionally, further records will continue to be added but the isOpen flag will be set to 0.p  pI want to add an additional Boolean column, called closedInYr, that has a 0 value UNLESS THE ACCOUNT CLOSES WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE SNAPSHOT DATE.p  pMy solution is slow and gross. It takes each record, counts forward in time 12 months, and if it finds a record with the same customerID, accountID, and isOpen set to 1, it populates the record with a 0 in the closedInYr field, otherwise it populates the field with a 1. It works, but the performance is not acceptable, and we have a number of these kinds of files to process.p  pAny ideas on how to implement this I use R, but am willing to code in Perl, Python, or practically anything except COBOL or VB.p  pThanksp

Negative 25562 pIn order to provision my device on the users home WiFi network, it will temporarily act as an Accesspoint in order to receive the WiFi network details from the client.  As part of the setup process, Id like to verify connection to the users WiFi network without losing AP connection to the client in order to provide the connection attempt status success or fail.

However, the users home wifi network turns out to be on a completely different channel e.g. 11.  If I attempt to use my station interface to connect to the users wifi network while maintaining connection with the client on my ap interface, this station test connection fails.  Or if it somehow connects to the users wifi network, the AP connection to the client drops.  If both ap and users home network happen to be the same channel, the test connection succeeds.

Negative 25562 pThe intersection of two triangles is either empty or an ngon for n up to 6.p  pIn theory, it is easy to come up with an algorithm to compute the intersection area. One can compute the possible intersections of all line segments and combine them with the points of the corner points of the triangles.p  pIn practise, there are some numerical issues. If line segments are nearly parallel, they may or may not have an intersection point and its calculation can be imprecise one usually divides by the determinant of the matrix, which is then approximately zero. p  pAny suggestions to avoid these numerical instabilitiesp
