Positive 1456 pI am puzzled. I have a simple python code. What it does is logging on a binary file the status of an internet connection. Every few seconds it pings an host on the public internet, and then it logs the timestamp as an unsigned int and the online status as a bool.p  pI am using codestruct.packcode to pack the binary data. Here is the function to add an entry to the logp  precodedef addpath, timestamp, online     handle  openpath, ab     handle.writestruct.packltI, timestamp, online     handle.close codepre  pAnd here is the call to that functionp  precodestorage.addsettings[logpath], time.time, online codepre  pNow, it worked fine for a long time like, a dozen of hours, and it logged properly everything. However, after a while I noticed that all the timestamps were nonsense. I realized that they were just out of alignment, so I traced back what happened when they went out of alignment.p  pHere is the binary data around the point where they get out of alignmentp  precodeDB 0C F2 55 01 E5 0C F2 55 01  EF 0C F2 55 01  F9 0C F2 55 01  03 0D F2 55 01  0D F2 55 01  lt What 17 0D F2 55 01  21 0D F2 55 01  2B 0D F2 55 01  35 0D F2 55 01  3F 0D F2 55 01  49 0D F2 55 01  53 0D F2 55 01  5D 0D F2 55 01  67 0D F2 55 01  71 0D F2 55 01  7B 0D F2 55 01  85 0D F2 55 01 codepre  pI just grouped the bytes in groups of five bytes, with the boolean Iamonline at the end. The first four bytes of each group represent a meaningful timestamp sometime last night, as little endian unsigned ints. p  pHowever in the point marked with an arrow, the group is just 4 bytes long.. No meaningful timestamp is represented, and everything gets out of alignment. In fact, it looks like it is the first byte of the timestamp that went missing. As you can see, I am doing and logging that ping test every 10 seconds, so around that point you should have codeF9code, code03code, then code0Dcode but that is missing..., then code17code, code21code, code2Bcode and so on. So the line that is shorter should have been something like code0D 0D F2 55 01code.p  pI am puzzled. How can this happen I thought that maybe when writing on the disk the program could have been killed or something, but it actually ran for the whole night without any pause. Is it possible that codestruct.packcode misses one byte at some point...p  pThis is really odd. Any idea would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 1456 pDoes anybody know a technique to discover memory leaks caused by smart pointers I am currently working on a large project written in strongCstrong that heavily uses smart pointers with reference counting. Obviously we have some memory leaks caused by smart pointers, that are still referenced somewhere in the code, so that their memory does not get freed. Its very hard to find the line of code with the needless reference, that causes the corresponding object not to be freed although its not of use any longer.p  pI found some advice in the web, that proposed to collect call stacks of the incrementdecrement operations of the reference counter. This gives me a good hint, which piece of code has caused the reference counter to get increased or decreased.p  pBut what I need is some kind of algorithm that groups the corresponding increasedecrease call stacks together. After removing these pairs of call stacks, I hopefully have at least one increase call stack left over, that shows me the piece of code with the needless reference, that caused the corresponding object not to be freed. Now it will be no big deal to fix the leakp  pBut has anybody an idea for an algorithm that does the groupingp  pDevelopment takes place under strongWindows XPstrong.p  pI hope someone understood, what I tried to explain ...p  pEDIt I am talking about leaks caused by circular references.p

Negative 1456 pI just had a conversation with my lead developer who disagreed that unit tests are all that necessary or important. In his view, functional tests with a high enough code coverage should be enough since any inner refactorings interface changes, etc. will not lead to the tests being needed to be rewritten or looked over again.p  pI tried explaining but didnt get very far, and thought you guys could do better.  So...p  pWhat are some good reasons to unit test code that functional tests dont offer What dangers are there if all you have are functional testsp  pstrongEdit 1strong Thanks for all the great answers. I wanted to add that by functional tests I dont mean only tests on the entire product, but rather also tests on modules within the product, just not on the low level of a unit test with mocking if necessary, etc. Note also that our functional tests are automatic, and are continuously running, but they just take longer than unit tests which is one of the big advantages of unit tests.p  pI like the brick vs. house example. I guess what my lead developer is saying is testing the walls of the house is enough, you dont need to test the individual bricks... p

Negative 1456 pI am having difficulty refreshing windows forms controls that are using a BindingSource object. We have a CABMVPSCSF client that I actually we since it is a team effort are developing that will interact with WCF services running on a remote server.  This is our first attempt at this, so we are in a learning mode.   One of the calls from the Presenter to the service returns a DataSet that contains 3 DataTables, named Contract, Loan and Terms.  Each table contains just one row.  When the service returns the dataset, we store it in the SmartPartView in a class member variable, by calling a function in the view called BindData and passing the dataset in to the view from the presenter classp  precodeprivate System.Data.DataSet ds  null public void BindDataSystem.Data.DataSet ds      string sErr       try              ds  ds   save to private member variable           more code goes down here       codepre  pWe are trying to bind each of the three DataTables to an assortment of Windows Forms TextBoxes, MaskedEditBoxes, and Infragistics UltraComboEditor Dropdown comboboxes We created three BindingSource objects, one for each DataTable using the VS2008 IDE.p  precodeprivate System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource bindsrcContract private System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource bindsrcLoan private System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource bindsrcTerms codepre  pWe are binding the values like thisp  precodeif bindsrcContract.DataSource  null      bindsrcContract.DataSource  ds     bindsrcContract.DataMember  contract      txtContract.DataBindings.Addnew BindingText, bindsrcContract, contractid, true                             txtLateFeeAmt.DataBindings.Addnew BindingText, bindsrcContract, feecode, true      txtPrePayPenalty.DataBindings.Addnew BindingText, bindsrcContract, prepaypenalty, true      txtLateFeeDays.DataBindings.Addnew BindingText, bindsrcContract, latedays, true   if bindsrcLoan.DataSource  null      bindsrcLoan.DataSource  ds     bindsrcLoan.DataMember  loan      mskRecvDate.DataBindings.Addnew BindingText, bindsrcLoan, receivedate, true      cmboDocsRcvd.DataBindings.Addnew BindingValue, bindsrcLoan, docs, true       codepre  pThis works when we do the first read from the service and get a dataset back.  The information is displayed on the forms controls, we can update it using the form, and then save it by passing the changed values back to the WCF service.p  pHere is our problem.  If we select a different loan key and make the same call to the service and get a new DataSet, again with 3 tables with one row each, the controls textboxes, masked edit boxes, etc. are not being updated with the new information.  Note that the smartPartView is not closed or anything, but remains loaded in between calls to the service.  On the second call we are not rebinding the calls, but simply trying to get the data to refresh from the updated DataSet.p  pWe have tried everything we can think of, but clearly we are missing something.  This is our first attempt at using the BindingSource control. We have triedp  precodebindsrcContract.ResetBindingsfalse codepre  pand p  precodebindsrcContract.ResetBindingstrue codepre  pand p  precodebindsrcContract.RaiseListChangedEvents  true codepre  pand p  precodefor int i  0 i lt bindsrcContract.Count i      bindsrcContract.ResetItemi  codepre  pAs well as resetting the DataMember property again.p  precodebindsrcContract.DataMember  Contract codepre  pWeve looked at a lot of examples.  Many examples make reference to the BindingNavigator but since the DataTables only have one row, we did not think we needed that. There are a lot of examples for grids, but were not using one here.

Negative 1456 pI just posted one question and got it answered very quickly, thank you.p  pI have a new problem, being I have a asp label which gets text dynamically set on it during instanation and then I have a onmousedown function tied to it call a javascript function to enable a table area that sitting below that is display  none by default.  It all works fine until I put two of these user controls on a page.  They both have the specificed label text correct but the javascript enable seems to set the display style attribute of the first usercontrols table to block instead of the one that is sitting below the label that was clicked.  I am sure this is because the script is running on the client side which I really would like to keep and all the user controls have the same id name since they are all instaniations of the same user control so the javascript to set the style display attribute just gets the first table.

Negative 1456 pIve inherited a project that stores various parameters either in a config file, the registry and a database. Whoever needs one of these parameters just reads and in some cases writes it directly from the store. This, or course, is stupid, so my first thought was to refactor the existing code so that the client doesnt know where the parameter is stored in. I created a classic AppSettings class that has a property for each parameter. Since the store has to have global scope I made a threadsafe singleton. The class doesnt store the parameter values in fields but rather acts as an access point by reading and writing them to and from the actual store, be it config file, registry or database. These days its hard to avoid all the talk about the dangers of singletons and global state. I will take a proper look at dependency injection and Spring etc later, but for now, I just have a couple of questions.p  ol liWhat type of problems, other than testability, can you see with my solutionbrli liWhat would be a light weight alternative Creating a factory for each object that uses the parameters is not an option too much work.brli liWouldnt using a singleton serve as an acceptable compromise until I have a chance to do some heavier refactoringbrli liIf the properties in my singleton class only had getters, would that make it OKli ol  pI can anticipate that the store for some of the parameters will change in the future eg. from registry to database, so that was my motivation for hiding the store behind a singleton class.p

Negative 1456 pIve developed a large base of unit tests for my companys application, and dev would like to hand my unit tests over to our support department to help them debug customer installation problems.  I wrote my unit tests using mstest, so support would have to install Visual Studio on a customers machine if they wanted to use my tests out of the box, which is the wrong thing to do, obviously. I have looked into using mstest without VS at the command prompt, but hacking the registry on a customers system to make it think VS is installed isnt workable either.p  pTo get around this I planned on compiling my mstests for nunit using the information in  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions709331switchingbetweenusingnunitandmstestforunittestingthis posta .

Negative 1456 pI am currently coding a project under c and am experiencing problems. Ill give a brief description of my formp  pIt has a datagridview on the bottom half of the form with single row selection, and is read only. On the top half of the form I have various components which are databound to the selected row on the datagridview. I did this because there was too many columns in the database to show in the datagridview without seriously cluttering up the UI. This is working fine and the format and parse events are being called correctly.p  pI have a Add New Record button which rebinds the controls on the top half to a new datarow which isnt part of the datatable yet and this is where Im having problems. Firstly when binding directly to a datarow it seems the controls arnt as happy with DBNull values as they are when binding to a datatable. But thats fine I just assigned default values to the new row before binding it. However, it seems the Format and Parse events are not fired when bound directly to a row for some reason, and I cant work out why The main reason I need these is I have a Date value column which ideally needs to be null blank from a UI perspective so I assign the DateTime.MinValue as a default value on the new row and then I look for this on the format  parse event and do the nessessary convertions. p  pI guess my main question is why does binding to a datarow raise DBNull exceptions when binding to a datatable with the same null values in the same columns raises no exception and the column constraints has Allow Nulls. My alternative question is why arent the Format  Parse events fired when a component is bound to a datarowp

Negative 1456 pTrying to use Linq to SQL for a small project Im working on at home. I have generated a the context code and all my entity classes using dbmetal.exe from the DBLinq project against a local MySQL database.p  pEverything is working great, but Im trying to abstract some redundant code and Im running into issues trying to do so. p  pBasically all my entities are of type Table in my context class. For example I have Table and Table. p  pWhile I was architecting the various interfaces for the repository behaviors I realized that there some methods that were very redundant with each entity. For example the ID fieldp  precodeUser findByIdint id Calendar findByIdint id codepre  pI designed my tables so they all have 3 fields in common [ID, DATECREATED, DATEUPDATED]. Since those fields are common I wanted to have a common behavior instead of rewriting those methods for each entity.p  pSo I made my repository classes UserRepository, CalendarRepository inherit a common Repository class thats defined like thatp  precodepublic class RepositoryltTgt  IDisposable, IRepositoryltTgt where T  class      protected MyContext context      private DbLinq.Data.Linq.TableltTgt currentTable      protected Repository          context  new MyContext          Type currentType  this.GetType.GetGenericArguments[0]         currentTable  Set currentTable based on currentType. e.g. currentTable  context.User                   region IRepositoryltTgt Members      public T findByIdint id              return currentTable.SingleOrDefaultd gt d.ID  id           public T findByDateCreatedDateTime dateCreated              return currentTable.SingleOrDefaultd gt DateTime.EqualsdateCreated, d.DateCreated           public T findByDateUpdatedDateTime dateUpdated              return currentTable.SingleOrDefaultd gt DateTime.EqualsdateUpdated, d.DateUpdated           public T insertT domainObject              currentTable.InsertOnSubmitdomainObject         return domainObject           public T saveT domainObject              context.SubmitChanges         return domainObject           endregion      region IDisposable Members      public void Dispose              if context  null             context.Dispose           endregion  codepre  pWell it turns out this is more difficult than I thought.

Until I try to pass a variable.p  precodeMaingt averageFrac [1,2,3] 2.0 Maingt let x  [1,2,3] Maingt t x x  [Integer] Maingt averageFrac x  ltinteractivegt10     No instance for Fractional Integer       arising from a use of averageFrac  at ltinteractivegt108     Possible fix add an instance declaration for Fractional Integer     In the expression average x     In the definition of it it  averageFrac x codepre  pApparently, Haskell is really picky about its types.  That makes sense.  But not when they could both be [Num]p  pAm I missing an obvious application of RealFracp  pIs there way to coerce Integrals into Fractionals that doesnt choke when it gets a Fractional inputp  pIs there some way to use codeEithercode and codeeithercode to make some sort of polymorphic average function that would work on any sort of numeric arrayp  pDoes Haskells type system outright forbid this function from ever existingp  pLearning Haskell is like learning Calculus.  Its really complicated and based on mountains of theory, and sometimes the problem is so mindbogglingly complex that I dont even know enough to phrase the question correctly, so any insight will be warmly accepted.p  pAlso, footnote this is based off a homework problem. Everybody agrees that averageFrac, above, gets full points, but I have a sneaking suspicion that there is a way to make it work on both Integral AND Fractional arraysp

Can GIT, Mercurial, SVN, or other tools do a good job when only part of a binary file is changedp  pFor example, if the spec is written in .doc and it is part of the repository, then if it is 4MB, and edited 100 times but just for 1 or 2 lines, and checked in 100 times during the year, then it is 400MB.p  pIf it is 100 different .doc and .xls files, then it is 40GB... not a size that is easy to manage.p  pI have tried GIT and Mercurial and see that they both seem to add a big size of data even when 1 line is changed in a .doc or .pdf.  Is there other way inside of GIT or Mercurial or SVN that can do the jobp

Negative 1456 pIm just starting to play with MEF and have a couple questions.p  p1 I wrote a WCF service that takes in some xml and passes the xml off to a parser. The parsers are composed using MEF. metadata in the xml lets me determine which parser to use. I can add a new parser, and support new XML, by just dropping the dll in a directory. That part all works. But, WCF services can be instantiated multiple times, I want my parser catalog to be static, that is, if multiple instances of my service are spun up, and they get the same XML, I only need one instance of the parser running, they are written to be thread safe. I cant seem to configure MEF to do this. Anyone know howp  p2 I can drop in a new parser into the directory and a catalog refresh will automatically discover it, that works great. But if I try to drop a modified dll into the directory, and that parser has been activated in the service, I get an error saying the file is in use. Is there a way to override thisp

Negative 1456 pSo here is the situation a quote from my boss [...] we need to focus on programming.  [...] At the end of the day I want to write good software and not get bogged down with testing.  This is said after we have had 3 months of a daunting list of bugs and recently designating a nonprogrammer to write web tests with Selenium framework.p  pMy boss is very much unittest shy he cant see the cost benefit when it slows down developers.  What are your opinions out there on web tests and programmatic tests in general  Should they be written by the or a programmer or does it matter  My thought was that part of writing good software is writing tests  Hes a Microsoft ivorytower kind of guy, and so any resources out there that have been put out by Microsoft or good articles in general in favor of testing by design would be helpful.p

My question is what is the best way to convert this column into the the correct DATETIME field in SQL Server 2005p  pDoing a little thinking I felt I could copy the Advantage TimeStamp column into a varchar column and then run a sql script that would do the conversion for me.

Negative 1456 pI would appreciate some advice on an iphone game design. I want to display some backround image and other images on top of it buildings, characters etc. The backround is going to be large up to 10 times the size of the screen so only a piece of the background file will be displayed at once. The idea is to replace this piece when character gets close to screen borders. I need to make this background transition as a smooth animation.

The error crops up because of the casting of a linear layout into a relative layout and this is where the issue is. The portrait layoutmain.xml is in its default layout folder. This layout has the relative layoutrlmain. The landscape layoutmain.xml resides in the layoutland folder. This main.xml has different UI specifications and has the linear layout. By default I load in portrait mode where it loads fine and the I press Ctrl  F11 to change it to Landscape, the layout from layoutland folder loads fine. Then I press Ctrl  F11 again to change to Portrait where the main.xml from the default layout folder should have loaded but is not getting loaded which is why I am getting the case exception.p

Third, thanks in advance for any help p  pOk...p  pI am given a text file like thisp  blockquote   p4 6br 010000br 011010br 011010br 101100p blockquote  pThe first two digits are the number of rows and number of columns. p  pI am supposed to read this into a dynamically allocated 2d array so I can manipulate specific digits in the array.p  pI have got 4 and 6 stored into variables no problem as well created the array and allocated space correctly. I just cant seem to figure out how to get all the 0s and 1s into the array. Ive been searching around for a while without any luck.p  pI am also not allowed to use the code[]code anywhere in my program, we are focusing on pointers so it has to all be done with pointers. However, if I can get a working solution with the code[]code notation I can try and make it all pointers later but right now I cant get either way to work correctly. p  pHere is the function I am writing that takes in an already opened filep  precode void imageFILE fp      int row 0, col0, i0, j0      int image       fscanffp, d d, amprow, ampcol        image  int mallocrowsizeofint       for i  0 i lt row i           imagei  int malloccolsizeofint            forj0 jlt col j               TRIED THIS BUT IT DOESNT WORK                fscanffp, d, ampimage[i][j]                                      printfdn, imagei         codepre  pThat is one way I have tried out of several others. Like I said Im willing to find a way that uses code[]code first and then try and convert it over to pointers. Id prefer if anyone could give me advice there because I am a bit lost. Either way thanks again for any helpp  pB.p

Negative 1456 pI am trying to use Celery as the control channel for a Twisted application. My Twisted application is an abstraction layer that provides a standard interface to various locally running processes via ProcessProtocol. I would like to use Celery to control this remotely  AMQP seems like the ideal method of controlling many Twisted apps from a central location, and I would like to take advantage of Celerys taskbased features, e.g. task retries, subtasks etc.p  pThis is not working as I had planned, and I am hoping someone can help point me in the right direction to get this working.p  pThe behaviour I am trying to achieve when I run my script isp  ul liStart a slightlymodified celeryd see belowli liWait for Celery tasksli liWhen the start process task is received, spawn a ProcessProtocolli liWhen other tasks are received, run a function on the Twisted protocol and return the result using Deferredsli ul  pThe slightlymodified celeryd is a hrefhttpask.github.comcelerycookbookdaemonizing.htmlceleryda with a small modification that allows tasks to access the Twisted reactor via self.app.twisted, and the spawned process via self.app.process. To keep things simple I am using Celerys solo process pool implentation, which does not fork a new process for task workers.p  pMy problem occurs when I try and use a Celery task to initialise the ProcessProtocol i.e. starting the external process. The process starts correctly, but the ProcessProtocols childDataReceived never gets called. I think this is something to do with file descriptors not being inheritedset correctly.p  pBelow is some sample code, based on the wc example in the ProcessProtocol documentation. It includes two Celery tasks  one to start the wc process, and another to count the words in some text using the previouslystarted wc process. p  pThis example is rather contrived but if I can get this working it will serve as a good starting point for implementing my ProcessProtocols, which are longrunning processes which will respond to commands written to stdin.p  pI am testing this by running the Celery daemon firstp  ppython2.6 mycelery.py l info P solop  pThen, in another window, running a script which sends two tasksp  ppython2.6 commandtest.pyp  pThe expected behaviour of commandtest.py is for two commands to execute  one starts the wc process, and the other sends some text to CountWordsTask.

When the user navigates away from the UIWebView, I would like to keep a reference to the UIWebView and its contents, so if the user decides to reopen the webview, its exactly where he or she left it.p  pIve tried this and it doesnt seem to work for me.

Negative 1456 pUsing the CoreScanner Driver provided by Motorola, Im trying to write a small winforms application that uses a barcode scanner. Im able to interact with the scanner just fine, and properly register a call back for the OnBarcodeEvent. In this callback, I have a Dialog that opens and displays a screen that the user needs to fill in. Shortly after the dialog is opened using Show, the program hangs. If I use ShowDialog, the dialog works, but the dialog is blocking the OnBarcodeEvent event.p  pMy guess to what is happening, is that since the dialog is getting created on the event thread, there is a race condition occurring when using Show. Since  Show is nonblocking, the thread continues on after displaying the dialog and then dies out.  Meanwhile my dialog just lost its parent and locks up Like i said... my best guess.p  pHow can I remedy the situation That is, How do I write my dialog so that it can be created within a thread not hangp

Negative 1456 pI am writing a function in Haskell that takes in a Java class file, and writes another class file that is identical but contains some modifications.

Negative 1456 pI am learning nodejs and I have a mongodb database with which i have to interact with.  I am currently thinking of using mocha for a unit test framework and zombie.js for a acceptance test framework. I was wondering how could I do full scale acceptance tests which hit the mongodb database. Is there a frameworkmodule that helps with replacing the database with a test database or does either mocha or zombie.js have functionality that can easily be used to replace the database.p  pAlso is there a framework that is similar to the idea of factories instead of fixtures in creating database objects.p  pA similar concept that I have encountered in the rails world is in rspec, there is a spechelper.rb file which runs before the tests are run which set the projects configuration to decide which database to hit when running tests.  And it uses databasecleaner to clean out the test database before tests are run. For factories, i have used Factory girl to create factory objects from database schema again in the rails world.p  pThanksp

Negative 1456 pHello I am fairly new to all of this. I have built my layout using divs that have their dimensions set as percentages so that they scale to the correct size when the browser window is resized. Some of the divs form buttons in a navigation bar with text on each. But when I resize the browser window the text stays large. Is there any way to solve thisp

Negative 1456 pHi I am have added the MWPhotoBrowser in my iPhone application it works great but now i need to add a little more functionality to my photo gallery.p  pbasically what to do a couple thingsp  ul liadd a button to the navigation barli lidecrease the space between two images.li ul  pHowever I dont know how to approach this problem.. should I subclass the Photo Browser or should I make changes in the Photo Browsers source code.p  pP.S. i tried to modify the code directly in MWPhotoBrowser.h file which didnt work. No changes were made. Im super new to iPhone programming so i dont have much idea what is going on. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I know its a noobish question so please go easy on down votes p

stream yet, or if it has it has chunked it off into a file, where I can then read it chunk by chunk.  The trouble is that I cannot find a way of parsing Message that does not convert the incoming  into the base64 encoded data in the attachment. After I get the SAXStaX event indicating the start of the  element, it is followed by a characters event which is the base64 encoded data. Looking at the code for StreamMessage there is no way to insert any XMLReader or XMLStreamReader etc. in front of the existing XMLStreamReader that the Message is already bound to  not suprising as we are part way through message processing.  But that XMLStreamReader implementation is a com.sun.xml.ws.encoding.MtomCodecMtomXMLStreamReaderEx which always unpacks attachments in line into memory. There is no way to paramterize the com.sun.xml.ws.encoding.MtomCodec class so that it does not first pass events to its inner MtomXMLStreamReaderEx class which unpacks the attachment inline.p  pI tried to read the attachment into a temporary file and then substitute the Message context  attachments for a FileDataSource, but since Metro ignores these, that only had the effect of making the original DataSource throw a ReadOnce type error.p  precodeMapltString, DataHandlergt attachments  MapltString, DataHandlergt ctxt.getMessageContext.getjavax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext.INBOUNDMESSAGEATTACHMENTS             HashMapltString, DataHandlergt clonedAttachments  new HashMapltString, DataHandlergtattachments             forString attachmentKey attachments.keySet                  StreamingDataHandler handler  StreamingDataHandler attachments.getattachmentKey                 File tempFile  File.createTempFileAttachment  attachmentKey, .xmlb64, new FileCUsersAdministratorworkspaceTool1TomcatWorkingDir                 handler.moveTotempFile                 FileDataSource newSource  new FileDataSourcetempFile                 clonedAttachments.putattachmentKey, new DataHandlernewSource                 System.out.printlnGot attachment   attachmentKey   of type   attachments.getattachmentKey                          ifattachments.isEmpty                  System.out.printlnGot No attachments                          else                  ctxt.getMessageContext.putjavax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext.INBOUNDMESSAGEATTACHMENTS, clonedAttachments              codepre  pI tried also turning off MTOM in the provider by setting the annotation to disabledp  precodeMTOMenabledfalse  codepre  pand then removing it and then the StreamingAttachment annotation to no avail. I also set the  enablemtomfalse attribute in the endpoint element for it in the sunjaxws.xml file, again to no avail it seems that xopInclude parsing is hardwired. I do not want to change the wsdl because that I do want clients to use MTOM if possible.  but see my swaRef answer below  p  pI can make Metro do what I want if I use swaRef, but my understanding was that MTOM is the protocol that has gained support With the swaRef I have to edit the WSDL p  precodelttypesgt           ltxsdschema             xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema             targetNamespacehttpswaRef.asynch.duke.example.org             elementFormDefaultqualifiedgt          ltxsdimport namespacehttpwsi.orgprofilesbasic1.1xsd                           schemaLocationhttpwww.wsi.orgprofilesbasic1.1swaref.xsdgt                ltcomplexType namesendBulkgt                 ltsequencegt                     ltelement namedata typewsiswaRef                         xmlnswsihttpwsi.orgprofilesbasic1.1xsdgt                 ltsequencegt             ltcomplexTypegt             ltelement namesendBulk typetnssendBulkgt codepre  pI also have to generate a new client and call the sendBulk method differentlyp  precodeFileDataSource newSource  new FileDataSourcefile DataHandler data  new DataHandlernewSource String result  port.sendBulkdata codepre  pBut now when I parse the data element I get the corresponding cid which I can then use to retrieve the attachment as I wishp  precodeDataHandler handler  attachments.getdataText.substringcid.length InputStream input  handler.getInputStream codepre  pSo, with MTOM and Metro though the attachments may have not been read up to the point where I parse the data element, or indeed streamed efficiently in chunks to a temporary file, I have no way to read the rest of the input message without reading the whole of the attachment into memory which seems self defeating Apart from dumping Metro  suggestions re Axis, CXF welcomed  is there any way around this anyone has discovered p  pLogged a hrefhttpjava.netjirabrowseJAXWS1070 relnofollowa feature requesta.p

Negative 1456 pSo ive been playing around a both with boxshadows, i recently did something just like this and it worked perfect. Then all of a sudden it stopped working for no apparent reasonp  pWhat im trying to do is have a simple div box with dual shadows underneath to make kind of folding effect.p  pIf you check it out at jfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netTJuDu relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netTJuDua you can see all the code ive done. The problem is the stacking of the before and after elements, its positioned properly but the stacking is wrong, the shadows are behind the .layout div when they should clearly be showing behind the .box div. If i remove the zindex value i can see the shadows positioned above the .box div.p  pThe thing is i did exactly like this on another page and it worked, then all of a sudden it stopped working on that page and on this example i made.p

Negative 1456 pI am relatively new to R and all its wisdom and I am trying to be more efficient with my script. I am using a loop to simulate how an animal moves among different sites. The problem that I have is that when I increase the number of sites or change the initial parameters based on fixed probability of moving or staying in the same site then I end with a very complicated loop. If I have to run several different simulations with different parameters, I prefer a more efficient loop or function that could adjust to different situations. The first loop will fill a matrix according to the initial probabilities and the second loop will compared the cumulative probability matrix against a random number from a list of values 10 in this example and will decide the fate of that individual either stay or go to a new sitep  pHere is a simplification of my codep  precodeNlt4  number of sites sitesltLETTERS[seqfrom1,toN]  p.staylt0.45 p.movelt0.4  moveltmatrixc0,nrowN,ncolN,dimnameslistcsites,csites fromltarray0,cN,N,dimnameslistcsites,csites toltarray0,cN,N,dimnameslistcsites,csites codepre  p Filling matrix with fixed probability p  precodeforfrom in 1N   forto in 1N      iffromtomove[from,to]ltp.stay else move[from,to]ltp.moveN1          move cumsum.moveltcumsumdata.framemove  stepslt100 resultltas.character  for storing results randltsamplerandom,steps,replaceTRUE  time.stepltdata.framerand colnamestime.stepltctime.step time.stepeventlt to.rltrbindsites jltsample1N,1,replaceT  first column to select random number kltsample1N,1,replaceT  site selected after leaving and coming back codepre  p Beginning of the longer loop p  precodefori in 1steps    if time.steptime.step[i]ltcumsum.move[1,j]time.stepevent[i]ltto.r[1] else       if time.steptime.step[i]ltcumsum.move[2,j]time.stepevent[i]ltto.r[2] else         if time.steptime.step[i]ltcumsum.move[3,j]time.stepevent[i]ltto.r[3] else            if time.steptime.step[i]ltcumsum.move[4,j]time.stepevent[i]ltto.r[4] else               if time.steptime.step[i]lt0.95time.stepevent[i]ltNA else                  if time.steptime.step[i]lt1.0 break  break the loop                result[i]lttime.stepevent[i]  jltwhichto.rresult[i]  iflengthj0jltk  for individuals the leave and come back later      time.step   result codepre  pThis loop is part of a bigger loop that will simulate and store the result after a series of simulations.

Every time I add a new view controller to the storyboard it gets inserted into a seemingly random place on the list.

Negative 1456 pI am trying to build a database to assist me with stock and order tracking I take and sell school photographs.  Without going into too much detail, basically I set up a display of photographs that are uniquely numbered.  As people order, they can claim the photographs on site to take home asection, andor they can also order additional copies to be collected later bsection.p  pI have the relationships set up between my Orders table, and the Photographs table with two junction tables asection, and bsection.  In the asection table, I want only the things being collected.  To my thinking, this has a onetoone relationship with the Photograph, and a onetomany relationship with the Order i.e. one order may pick up many photos but may only pick each photo once, and it may not be picked on another order either. The bsection table shows things being ordered, and has onetomany relationship with both Photograph and Order i.e. many orders may request prints of any photograph.p  pTo display this information in a subform datasheet view I use a query to collect the information and display it.  The asection query isp  precodeSELECT asec., Size.ssize, Photo.pdesc FROM [Size] INNER JOIN Photo INNER JOIN asec ON Photo.puid  asec.puid ON Size.suid  Photo.psize codepre  pasec contains a primary key the orderID and the foreign key for the onetoone relationship between photo.puid and asec.puid.  The query displays the Photograph ID, the Description of the Photograph, the Size of the photograph, and the Order Number it has been requested for collection. In the asection, the quantity will emalwaysem be 1, so a field for this is not required.p  pThe problem seems to be that when I delete a record from the query I have set up to populate the subform for the asection information, it deletes the record from the Photograph table also.  I have disabled cascade delete in the relationship, and disabled cascade update.  Even when I disable referential integrity altogether, it still persists with trying to delete the record from the photograph table.p  pCuriously, I have the bsection query set up as such practically identically and when I delete records from this query, it leaves the Photographs table alonep  precodeSELECT bsec., Size.ssize, Photo.pdesc FROM [Size] INNER JOIN Photo INNER JOIN bsec ON Photo.puidbsec.puid ON Size.suidPhoto.psize codepre  pIf I have selected a photograph into the asection and also into the bsection I am getting errors trying to remove it from asection, telling me it cant delete as there is related data in other tables.  This is because its trying to delete the record from the photograph table as well which I do not want it to do I only want it to delete the record from the asec table.  The only difference between the asec and bsec tables is that the field for puid the foreign key is set to Indexed No Duplicates in asec, and Indexed Duplicates OK in bsec.  This has to be as such to preserve the relationship setup I mentioned earlier, so I dont know how to get around it.p  pIf I go into the asec table itself, I can manually delete the line and naturally, it then disappears from the query but I would like to be able to delete it from the query view without it deleting the related record in the Photograph table.p  pLastly, if everyone hasnt gone TLDR on me, I am honestly not sure what I am doing wrong, and I really hope that someone can help me to figure it out.p

Negative 1456 pIm currently implementing an Oauth consumer service which is going to use Soundcloud as an Oauth service provider as well. But Im having the following issue with it Taking Facebook or Twitter example, you go there, you sign in, you fill up the permission form, and you are redirected back to your app. If you go there a second time, and given you are already sign in, you basically skip all steps and are redirected back instantly. That means, Facebook recognized that you already gave permission to that 3rd party service, so it doesnt ask your permission constantly. p  pAnd thats whats happening when I use Soundcloud. Basically everytime I redirected the user to the Soundcloud Oauth connect endpoint, the permission form always shows up, even though I already gave permission to that 3rd party service previously. Im forced to press connect every single time, which is a drag from the user perspective how many times can you give permission to the same entity. My question is is there a parameter I can use to make soundcloud recognizevalidate the previous permission from the user account to that specific 3rd party service Or is this Soundcloud Oauth design implementation and we have to live with it p  pEditp  pMaybe this wasnt clear, but each time I press connect in soundcloud, a new access token is being generated and delivered. Since my app uses this access token to identify its users, it doesnt work very well for me that the access token is getting updated everytime I want to log in, making me effectively sign up everytime. To sum it up, I want to get the previously attributed token to my account, so I can look up in my database, identify it and log him in. p  pIm also looking for a solution which doesnt involve storing state in the client that might get cleaned up. p

Negative 1456 pI have a rather complex situation and being new to SAS, I am beating my head against the wall trying to figure out a solution. I have two datasets controller, daq and in each dataset there is a measurement of power. I need to align the controller data with the daq data. There is a time stamp in each dataset BUT, they didnt bother time syncing the daq with the controller so there is an indeterminate amount of time delta between the two. To further complicate matters, both systems sample the data at different rates.... and while the controller is only recording data during the test, the daq records for longer periods of time.  So for a typical test run the controller has about 1000 rows of data and the daq has 30,000 rows at different sample rates which means that the absolute measurements will not likely match exactly.p  pI am trying to figure out a way to automatically align the data  i.e. figure out where the curve of the controller data most closely matches the curve of the daq data  giving us the time delta. p  pMy current thought is to iterate through two arrays, subtracting daqrow[i] from controllerow[j] and then adding up the deltas for the curve and finding the minimum deltap  precode      set work.daqPower work.controlPower array pwrdaq daqPwr   daqPwr is name of power variable in work.daqPower  array pwrcontrol controlPwr   controllPwr is name of power variable in work.controlPower  do idaq1 to 30000  1000     x  idaq     tmp  0     do jcontrol1 to 1000         tmp  tmp  ABSpwrdaq[x]  pwrcontrol[jcontrol]         x  x  1     end     output end codepre  pI am apparently not understanding the array documentation.

The point is that the the curve from the controller is a much shorter interval than the daq and we are trying to determine the time difference by aligning where the curve of the controller most closely matches the curve of the controller. I say curve, because initially thought of just matching the max value, but while there is only one max value from the controller data, the daq data goes on for a much longer period and the power curve crosses that value many times, so it would difficult to align the data based on just that.p
Negative 1456 pId like to compare differences between two lists of strings. For my purposes, whitespace is noise and these differences do not need to be shown.

Negative 1456 pI have a list of object identifiers a long enumeration list, with a unique value per identifierp  precodeenum Identifier    Enum0,   an identifier for a bool value   Enum1,    ... for a float value   Enum2,    ... for an int value    etc.  codepre  pI wish to maintain a collection of Value objects associated with these identifiers. hese Value objects contain a single value, but this value may be integer, floating point, boolean or some other simple type. This is in the context of managing a set of configuration values in a system. Later on I plan to extend these value types to support validation of the internal value, and relate some values to other values.p  pHowever I wish to use templates for these Value classes, because I want to write operations on these Values generically. If I were to use inheritance I would have BaseValue, then derive IntValue, FloatValue, etc. from BaseValue. Instead I have Value, Value, etc.p  pBut I also want to store an access mechanism to each of these Values in a single collection. I want one class to instantiate all of them and maintain them in the collection. If I were using inheritance, I could use a vector of pointers to BaseValue. But because Im using templates, these classes are not polymorphically related to each other.p  pSo I thought about making them based on an empty abstract base class that is strongnotstrong parameterisedp  precodeclass BaseParameter    templatelttypename Tgt class Parameter  public BaseParameter   public   explicit ParameterT val  valval    void setParameterSource src  val  extractltTgtsrc    T get  return val   private   T val  codepre  pNote that the set member function takes a ParameterSource, which is a source of a value that is reinterpreted by specific totype functions. Its an API function out of my control  I have to interpret the type myself, given that I know what the type is meant to be, set below. Thats what extract does  its specialised for various T types like float, int, bool.p  pThen I can add them to a stdvector like thisp  precodestdvectorltBaseParameter gt vec10 vec[Enum0]  new Parameterltboolgttrue    this is where I state that its a bool vec[Enum1]  new Parameterltfloatgt0.5     ... or a float ... vec[Enum2]  new Parameterltintgt42        ... or an int ... codepre  pI know I should probably use uniqueptr but for now Im just trying to get this working. So far this seems to work fine. But Im wary of it because Im not sure the full type of the instantiated templates is going to be retained at runtime.p  pLater I want to index the vec by an arbitrary enum value, retrieve the parameter and call a member function on itp  precodevoid setviasourceIdentifier id, ParameterSource source     if id is in range...   vec[id]gtsetsource  codepre  pAnd other code that makes use of these configuration values and therefore knows the type can access them withp  precodeint foo  vec[Enum2]gtget  7 codepre  pThis seemed to work, most of the time. It compiles. Ive had some odd crashes I cant explain, that tend to crash the debugger too. But Im very suspicious of it, because I dont know whether C is able to determine the real type of the pointedto object including the parameterised type, because the base class isnt parameterised itself.p  pUnfortunately it seems to me that if I parameterise the base class, then I essentially remove the commonality between these Value classes that allow them to be stored in a single container.p  pI took a look at boostany to see if that might help, but Im not sure it would apply in this case.p  pAt a higher level, what Im trying to do is connect a vast collection of configuration items from an external source via an API that delivers values of different type depending on the item, and store them locally so that the rest of my code can easily access them as if they are simple data members. I also want to avoid writing a giant switch statement because that would work.p  pIs this something that Type Erasure might help me withp

Return View End Function codepre  pI would like to be able to browse these actions the same way I would browse them with an id parameter ..BookConsultMyBookNamep  pBut I want the default route to continue to work with id parameters. In other words, I would like the default route to accept either id or name as parameter name.p  pSo I tried to configure my routes like this but it does not work as all the requests seems to use the first route and never the second. Actions with id parameters do not work anymore.p  precode     routes.MapRoute          nameName,          urlcontrolleractionname,          defaultsNew With .controller  Home, .action  Index, .id  UrlParameter.Optional            Default Route     routes.MapRoute          nameDefault,          urlcontrolleractionid,          defaultsNew With .controller  Home, .action  Index, .id  UrlParameter.Optional       codepre  pMy code examples are in VB but I will accept answers in C as well  Thanks a lot folks.p  pEDIT To clarify,if I simply rename the parameter to id, everything works fine with just the default route in my route config. But I would like to keep name as it is way more clean in these specific cases..p

Negative 1456 pI have a script postprocessing.sh. This script is suppossed to be used for the postprocessing of the data ouput of a thermohydraulic simulation package, called by a parent program called npo.p  pThe code below is suppossed to find a datavector CFVALU10000202 in the data file MELC.PTF write the datavector to a file DATA1, perform a little simple postprocessing and finally write the result to ext.goal1.p  pTo that end a lot of the functions used MREAD, write g0.s0, essentially everything written to aptplot1.gr a part of a plottingtool installed in a different part of the file tree. We invoke this plotting tool when calling aptbatch.sh with aptplot1.gr as input argument. The path to aptbatch.sh is saved in the path variable of the .bashrcfile. p  pWhen executing the script below from bash by typing either .postprocessing.sh or bash postprocessing, it does strongexactlystrong as expected. The files DATA1, aptplot1.gr and ext.goal1 are produced in the current working directory with the correct content.p  pWhen running npo the program, that calls postprocessing.sh, aptplot1.gr is written to file but neither DATA1 nor ext.goal1 is produced. The program stalls when trying to call aptbatch.sh. Trying experimentally to run postprocessing.sh without using aptbatch.sh, just writing a set of random variables to file works fine, so the problem is not in calling the postprocessing script.p  pAccording to the author of npo the program should just issue a system command with the name of the script, invoking the command shell.p  pI tried looking into permissions for the executables involved and applied chmod x to anything and everything but no dice. Can anyone think of a system variable or permission right that could result in thisp  precode binsh cd MelcorNordicBWRMinGoalFctNordicBWR0508   clean up rm f aptplot1 ext.goal1 DATA1   write read out commands for data vector to file echo  MELCOR 0 PTF MELC.PTF gt aptplot1.gr echo  MREAD 0 CFVALU10000202 DONE gtgt aptplot1.gr echo  write g0.s0 FILE .DATA1 gtgt aptplot1.gr  execute file aptbatch.sh batch aptplot1.gr nosafe hardcopy   postprocessing of max. data value awk BEGIN max  0 if 2gtmax max2 GF  max10000 if GFlt0 GF10000max END printf6.5fn, GF    DATA1 gt ext.goal1 codepre  pSummaryp  pScript runs fine from command line, script stalls at aptbatch.sh when called by program but works fine even in this case, without the aptbatch.sh call.

Negative 1456 pI have two vectors X and Y of differing lengths. Assumep  precodeX  ca,b,c,d,e Y  cx,y,z codepre  pI have a parameter alpha which will be set between the values 0 and 1. I want to merge these two vectors in a probabilistic manner. That is a function that pulls from vector X alpha percent of the time and from Y the remainder of the time. For example if alpha is set at 0.9, then the resultant vector R, could bep  precodeR  a,x,b,c,d,y,e,z codepre  pNotice the front portion of the vector has lots more elements from X because alpha is high. Is there a quick way to do this in R Im doing this with arrays and queues in Perl which I find is cumbersome. Also, I neednt care if the order is different the next time it is run because its inherently probabilistic.p  pI need to preserve the order in each vector X amp Y.  Notice the a,b,c,d... and x,y,z are in order.p

Negative 1456 pIn modeling business domain many times I came across a situation where multiple inheritance of a class could make my model a lot cleaner and simple. I know, in most of the programming languages, including java that is going to be the prime language of my project,  multiple inheritance is not supported.

Is it a good or at least acceptable idea to use multiple inheritance to model domain in UML to explain the concepts and leave it on implementers how they implement it Or it has more cons than prosp

Negative 1456 pIm having trouble arriving at an approach to this problem. tldr I want to be able to set the css class of an li to the name of the currentuser that posted the chat. Then based on that class, Ill apply different styling.p  pThis is for a chat window and I want all the current users messages to display on one side and I want all other messages to display on the other side with a different color, etc.p  pI have a codefile.js.coffeecode that basically reads in some user input and apends it to an ordered list and adds some elements and classes along the wayp  precode      projectRef.on childadded, snapshot gt         message  snapshot.val         ltli classselfgt.appendltdiv classmessagegt.appendltpgt.textmessage.text.prependltbgt.textmessage.name   .appendTo messagesDiv         messagesDiv[0].scrollTop  messagesDiv[0].scrollHeight        messageInput.keypress e gt         if e.keyCode is 13           text  messageInput.val           projectRef.push              name userName             text text           messageInput.val  codepre  pThe above would yield something like this in the browserp  precodeltli classselfgt  ltbgtUser  ltbgt   ltdiv classmessagegt    ltpgtMy chatt message from file.js.coffeeltpgt   ltdivgt ltligt codepre  pThat self class in the li is what I have been trying to dynamically set based on the currentuser. So I have 2 issues  1. Im trying to figure out who posted the li and 2. Im trying to dynamically set the class of that li based on the user that chattedposted it. p  pMy thinking was something along the lines of in the file.js.coffee use JQuery to grab that li and add the codelt currentuser.name gtcode as a class then I could have a file.js.erb where I would do something like p  precodelt unless li.hasClasslt currentuser.name gt gt     lt li.toggleClassothers gt lt end gt codepre  pThis way it checks if the class of the target codelicode is from the current user and if it is keep the css class as self if not toggle it to others. Then I could style the classes appropriately left, right, codebackgroundcolorbluecode, etc.p  pIs there a more correct way to approach this problem given what I am trying to accomplish I think so.. p

Negative 1456 pI think there are lots of related questions on this but I could not find  an answer that can satisfy my question. p  pSuppose I have a codedivcode that has an absolute position and can only show when an element was clicked and that div will contain anything, I mean values from the database for example and when the user deletes a data on that div, the div will be automatically refreshed and updates the data on it. p  pMy problem is that how could I refresh that div without refreshing the whole documentwindow. I know codewindow.reloadcode but that refreshes the entire document. How could this be done in jQuery. p

I want to draw another line, say Line 2, starting from mEndPoint1 and having a constant angle of alpha with Line 1.

However, when the angle of line 1 changes the arrow does not show correctly. Basically the user should be able to draw Line 1 as heshe wants and arrow line should show correctly regardless of the angle of Line 1.p  pI have expressed line 1 as vector and got its angle through the following codep  precodeclass CVector2D  wxPoint mStartPoint, mEndPoint public CVector2DmStartPoint,mEndPoint   CVector2DwxPoint p1, wxPoint p2mStartPointp1,mEndPointp2    float GetSlopevoid      return floatmEndPoint.ymStartPoint.yfloatmEndPoint.xmStartPoint.x   float GetSlopeAngleInRadians         Will return the angle of the vector in radians     The angle is the counterclockwise rotation therefore it is negative          float slopeGetSlope     float InRadiansatan2floatmEndPoint.ymStartPoint.y,floatmEndPoint.xmStartPoint.x     ifInRadianslt0 return InRadians     return 2PIInRadians    codepre  pAnd then I tried to calculate with the following codep  precodeCVector2D vectormStartPoint,mEndPoint float vectoranglevector.GetSlopeAngleInRadians float totalanglevectorangleARROWANGLE wxPoint p p.xmEndPoint.xARROWLENGTHcostotalangle p.ymEndPoint.yARROWLENGTHsintotalangle mArrowHead1new CLinemEndPoint,p,color,PenWidth codepre  pHowever, this code did not work either.

Negative 1456 pI have an existing program that encrypts and decrypts a text file on a line by line basis other functions within the application append encrypted lines to the file randomly so you cant just encrypt the whole thing.p  pOccasionally I need to search through the entire encrypted file looking for a certain string, so at the moment I read all the lines of the file into an array I then loop through the array passing each element to the decryption function so I can search accordingly example code below.p  precode Dim objReader As New System.IO.StreamReadermy file      Dim decryptedarray As New ArrayList     Do While objReader.Peek ltgt 1         decryptedarray.AddDecryptStringobjReader.ReadLine, SystemKey     Loop codepre  pMy main problem is that some of the files can be around 20000 lines long and while reading the lines into memory only takes a fraction of a second, the process of iterating through the array and decrypting each element is taking around 60 seconds which is a long time for a user to wait.p  pI was wondering if there is a more efficient way of performing an action on all elements of an array than just looping through it to try and improve the speed.

Heres what Im trying to do.p  pI have a form that is based on the table TblLedgerEntry. It lists an ID, Date, Status of Job, and details. There is a second table TblLedgerAccouting that lists related accounting transactions TransID, Check , Check Amount, DebitCredit based on the TblLedgerEntry ID. There can only be one entry in the TblLedgerAccounting for any one ID. The separate tables exist because there are several ID where there is no corresponding TransID.p  pI have created a button that adds a record to the TblLedgerAccounting. However, if there is already a TransID for the corresponding ID then it errors on me AFTER the user inputs the accounting information. I want it to error BEFORE the user inputs the information.

Negative 1456 pThis is my first time asking something on this awesome website, so please, be polite with me if Im breaking some rule.p  pSo, heres my problem, I have developed a ecommerce software for a certain customer, in Asp.NET, MVC4.  Then, I developed another ecommerce for a different customer, obviously starting from the last one. Now I have two similar ecommerce projects, differing only for some feature I had to add for the newer customer. The problem is that now, the old customer,  wants me to update his ecommerce as well, adding the new features I already added for the other one of course he doesnt want his data to be lost, so I have to migrate all the data stored in the old database, to an updated version, with a different scheme for example, the new scheme has tables, relations and columns, not present on the old one. p  pWhich is the best solution you suggest me to follow Are there functions in sql server already, suitable for the purpose Does the framework include some solution for this Thanks in advance, and sorry for my poor english. If I have not explained correctly, I will be happy to give you more detail.p

Negative 1456 pHi everyone I need some guidelines to make an application which behaves some thing like a web server. p  pThe basic idea is you run that app on your android mobile.and that will present you an ip address current ip of the mobile device.p  pThen on another system Internet browser you enter the IP address provided by android app, it will show a simple web page.p  pThis web page will contain few links. If you click any of the link a text will be displayed accordingly. The app running should get notified about the link clicked and then app will send back a text based on the link pressed, and that text will be displayed in the browserp  pThats it nothing much more than that is required, I dont want any complex calculation or script executions to embed a complete web server.p  por some how through socket programming to listen to for a specific url request  and based on url name i can send back simple html.p

Negative 1456 pI have some binary data in a file and load the file into memory at codechar datacode. Now I know e.g. that at offset 123 begins a codestruct somethingcode.p  pIs it safe to do the followingp  precodestruct something data  123  ampdata [123] codepre  pand then access members of the struct. Or should I do something likep  precodestruct something record memcpy amprecord, data  123, sizeof struct something  codepre  pOr even something completely differentp  pMy question is mainly motivated, because I have some fuzzy recollections about memory alignment, word boundaries, etc...p
Negative 1456 pI have 3 Tomcat servers under a Load Balancer. Each of these servers have the same 3 war files. The Load balancer checks the health of the Tomcat server by checking if Tomcat is listening to port 8080, if it receives a successful response, routes the traffic to that Tomcat server.p  pNow issue is that when Tomcat is starting up, it responds success to the Load balancer port check, even before all the war files are deployed. So initial requests routed to the Tomcat Server result in 404 because the application has not yet been deployed.p  pIs there a way I can prevent Tomcat from responding success to Load balancer port check until after all the web applications have been deployedp

Negative 1456 pI came across an interesting HTML button tag behavior while trying to style a button that has no text inside, only a font icon  the button without text causes all subsequent buttons which do have text to be pushed down.

This is why I have decided to position the icon inside absolutely, which fixes the original slight positioning issue, but introduces this new one, as the button now acts as if it were empty.p  pSo, the question remains  how do I avoid positioning issues with empty buttonsp  pstrongNotestrong it seems that the above only happens on webkit browsers Firefox positions buttons with text correctly, but pushes the empty ones up.p

Negative 1456 pIt is possible to achieve that as it has been discussed several times for instance in stackoverlow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5420384convertanimageintobinarydatainjavascripthere ap  pIn fact it is even possible to access directly the raw data through a get query but and a bookmarlet using the canvas is available at jsfiddle.netbgmortm26yrp  pThe problem is that  such a bookmarklet failed for image that are not in same domain than the active window. Even a subdomain does not works and it is quite common that a web page has images loading from a subdomain like images.example.com . p  pIm aware of CORS restrictions but is there a way to achieve this for all images in the active windows  May be through a frame or another tab  Or SVGDOM  p  pAs soon as accessing same domain image data from a bookmarklet is allowed I dont see what are the additional risks for other images.p

Negative 1456 pI have a PHP web form that accepts file uploads image and text, from which text is extracted OCR and .pdf, .doc, etc stripped to plain text.  The text extraction is performed by using codeexeccode to invoke a jar filecommand line process I am not in control of the source for either which returns the text.  While testing there is no issue, however, with 5 simultaneous PDF uploads each about 5MB the server load maxes out.  The entire process each upload takes 1015 seconds and load drops back to normal immediately after.p  pI am assuming the issue is with Java and allocation to the JRE for each exec call when manually invoking the jar file from the command line it takes about 10 seconds, so nearly the same as a single upload response.  Running the extraction as background processes is not possible because the HTTP response contains the data processed from the uploaded files text.  I considered forking the process, but that doesnt help with the server load will probably make it worse.  I am hoping to avoid rewriting the service entirely in Java.  p  pIs there a way to preload the Java process JRE or pipe successive files to the same, or something of the likep

Negative 1456 pIm using the LruCache to cache several bitmaps in my Android app. But because I load those bitmaps according to data from more than one datatable from the database. For example Object A is stored in table A and has an image while object B is stored in table B and has another image. p  pThe ID for object A and B might be the same because they are stored in different tables. Therefore I have also two or more LruCache instances which I think is not that good. So I want to store all images in just one LruCache but then I need a key that can handle multiple occurences of the same ID. My guess is writing a key class.

Negative 1456 pIs it sensible to use Meteor for a reactive data display that isnt primarily HTML basedp  pTo be specific, I want to display a graph database as a set of boxes connected by lines. Id like to allow live interaction with these boxes, and Id also like them to be reactive, so if one user edits the data the display of any other users currently viewing the graph will update.p  pMeteor seems great for the reactivity, but most of the examples Ive found focus on either HTML templates or very simple API interactions for doing things like adding a pin to a map.p  pI am currently thinking about using SVG or Canvas to display the graph database, but I am very unsure how best to integrate that with Meteor andor some other library like maybe D3.p
Negative 1456 pIm having trouble it seems with reading in lines from a text file.  When I do the whole f.readline I can save it to a string and then print off the correct text however when lets say I go to print the first or second character of the string I just made itll print a strange like dot checker pattern character instead of the correct letter.p  pEdit Ok so when I try alfasins method I seem to get the correct length of each line besides the first line that is read in.  If Im say reading in 5 lines and looking for a space, the first line with find the first space at spot 13 when it should find it at spot 8.  However the next lines read in will all produce the correct length and location of the space.p  pEdit2 Also the text file I am reading in is UTF8.p  pEdit3 Definitely was an issue with the encoding of the text file.

Then a for loop is iterating through the input string char by char and if the variable ch is found it gets pushed in to the stack. However what i find weird is that from my understanding of a switch statement each case should have a action after it. In this case there is no action after case  or case [ or case p  pAlso if i am understanding this correct for the open delimiters the switch statement is suggesting a push action and for the closing ones its initiating a pop action, given that stack is not empty p  pCan anyone please clear it up  Also if possible show me a hand traced example with a small string . p

Negative 1456 pMy program loads a few files once for each instance when they are needed for the first time. The problem is when called through command line, every call creates a new instance. Now my program is called from another subsystem in a loop and since every time it has to load all those files, it is very slow.p  pSo is there a way to somehow keep a reference to an instance of the program and execute commands on the same instance every time Any other solutions to thisp
Negative 1456 pI have a series of blocks that fall, and when they get to a certain point a grey block placeholder for dust appears it goes away if the block bounces up past a certain point, then reappears when the block falls down again, getting smaller each time impact occurs. p  pCurrently, however, since a emclassem for the grey block is what is being affected, any falling block affects the overall size of the dust block despite falling and hitting at different times. I would like to keep track of each dust block separately, so each one changes depending on when the color block it is associated with impacts on the ground.p  pIve tried using ids  idsmokei, smokei.height40smokeGlobal  instead of a single class, but it appears doing that only allows the first block to animate. I assumed a for loop is necessary there, but adding that in seemed to cancel the dust block altogether.p  pAs always, help would be appreciated.

Negative 1456 pIm new to the concept of maintaining user accounts in a website. I read from this a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsOAuth2Login relnofollowGoogle developers pagea that Google provides an codeauthenticationcode and an codeauthorizationcode service. Im only interested in maintaining accounts on my website that users can log into using their Google account username and password. I have an codeExpress.jscode server. p  pIve spent hours reading about this online and stumbled upon one thing the codepassportgoogleoauthcode module can be used to do this. But I was unable to find how to get this working with the latest version of Express. Please help. p  pI would also like to know how to create a project on the Google Developers Console so that the users do not need Google accounts to use oauth2 to get the Client id and secret.p

Negative 1456 pI tried googling this but I get different answers at different places. I want to know the cases wherein one should use one of the followingp  precodeinclude ltstdiogt include ltcstdiogt include ltiostreamgt codepre  pI cannot figure out the difference since in my case all my C programs seem to work if I use these interchangeably. That being said, iostream seems to support the stream of input and output by defining cin and cout etc. However, I maybe wrong. I would appreciate answers  credible citations for the usage of these with reference to the C standards. I wonder if there are any performance benefits involved in using one over the other.p

Negative 1456 pIm hoping that this question isnt too general but Im looking for details regarding what features the Visual Studio SPA Template which is available using New Project  Visual C  Web  ASP.NET Web App  SPA actually provides and how to use it. I understand the frameworks the project adds and what they are for, can provide, limitations etc. e.g.   JQuery    Bootstrap   Knockout    Sammyp  pHowever Im more interested in the code the generated in the app..js sections. I can see that the generated code switches between views by leveraging Knockout for view definition and by using the included navigator factory. p  pThe more specific question really is, is this all the included template is good for as Im not seeing anything else the navigator factory does other than what Ive described. p  pIf Im looking for screen state and navigation management within my SPA am I basically looking at rolling my own within this code or saving my self that pain by dumping the auto generated stuff and looking at adopting and working with a SPA framework like Durandal. p  pGoing back to the question therefore is there anywhere where I can see what features SPA template project has and how to use themp

Negative 1456 pIm following a tutorial on building a website using Spring MVC with some basic Spring Security. I have the following issuep  pstrongFunctionalitystrongp  pThe jQuery in the home page sends a request to the codegetmessagescode method which returns a JSON object representing a map. The size property is the quantity of messages. jQuery then updates a SPAN tag with that value. This SPAN tag is contained within a codeltsecauthorize accessisAuthenticatedgtcode tag so only logged in users can see it. This is done on a loop every 5 seconds.p  pThe codegetMessagescode URL is protected by an codeisAuthenticatedcode intercept.p  pstrongExpected Behaviorstrongp  ul liThe user clicks the Log In link on the home page, which brings the user to the login pageli liThe user successfully logs in and the user is redirected back to the home page.li ul  pstrongActual Behaviorstrongp  ul liThe user clicks the Log In link on the home page, which brings the user to the login pageli liThe user successfully logs in but the user is redirected to the codegetmessagescode URL which displays the raw JSON datali ul  pI assume this is happening because the jQuery request to codegetmessagescode is occurring regardless if the user is logged in or not. When the user does log in, Spring redirects to the most recent request attempt for a protected URL, in this case codegetmessagescode.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow do I achieve my expected behavior. Ideally, I would prefer jQuery not to call codegetmessagescode if the user is not authenticated. I have tried surrounding that part of the jQuery in codeltsecauthorize accessisAuthenticatedgtcode which does work but I have no idea if including sec tags in jQueryJavaScript code goodbadugly practice. p  pAnother possibility is to return from the server to jQuery a variable that indicates if the user principal is logged in, and then use that in an IF statement to guard entry to the codegetmessagescode callp  pId appreciate advice on the best way to approach this problem.p  pstrongCodestrongp  pHome Page jQueryp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt   function getMessageCountdata

Negative 1456 pI am using SQL Server 2008. The server is in india. I want to store the users login and logout time. I can easily do that in SQL Server.p  pNow we have clientsadmins from different countries who will check those loginlogout time. They want these times in their respective time zone. p  pOne more scenario is my clients travel from one country to another country, so the log time should be automatically updated as per the timezone.p  pSo my understanding is I have to store the timezone info along with datetime for clients. So that I can use codeTimeZoneInfoConvertTimecode method to convert to different time zones.p  pI can give my clients an option to save their timezone while registration.p  pBut my doubt is if my client changes his country do they need to change their timezone manually or is there any way i can automatically detect timezone. Is it feasible to check for the system timezonep  pOr anyway storing timestamp can help mep

On the second page the user grabs that url, types in the textfield, that url gets shorten and then get stored into parse.p  pFor example, below is the code that allows the user to select an item from drive and where a long url is returnedp  pEssentially, I want to combine two codes together aiming at the same objective.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt   ltheadgt     ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsangularjs1.0.7angular.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpwww.parsecdn.comjsparse1.2.12.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltmeta httpequivcontenttype contenttexthtml charsetutf8gt     lttitlegteSnail Scan Upload Part 2lttitlegt      ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         The Browser API key obtained from the Google Developers Console.       var developerKey  ID         The Client ID obtained from the Google Developers Console.       var clientId  ID         Scope to use to access users photos.       var scope  [httpswww.googleapis.comauthphotos]        var pickerApiLoaded  false       var oauthToken         Use the API Loader script to load google.picker and gapi.auth.       function onApiLoad          gapi.loadauth, callback onAuthApiLoad         gapi.loadpicker, callback onPickerApiLoad               function onAuthApiLoad          window.gapi.auth.authorize                            clientid clientId,               scope scope,               immediate false             ,             handleAuthResult               function onPickerApiLoad          pickerApiLoaded  true         createPicker               function handleAuthResultauthResult          if authResult ampamp authResult.error            oauthToken  authResult.accesstoken           createPicker                         Create and render a Picker object for picking user Photos.       function createPicker          if pickerApiLoaded ampamp oauthToken            var picker  new google.picker.PickerBuilder.               enableFeaturegoogle.picker.Feature.MULTISELECTENABLED.               addViewgoogle.picker.ViewId.PDFS.               setOAuthTokenoauthToken.               setDeveloperKeydeveloperKey.               setCallbackpickerCallback.               build           picker.setVisibletrue                         A simple callback implementation.       function pickerCallbackdata          var url  nothing         if data[google.picker.Response.ACTION]  google.picker.Action.PICKED            var doc  data[google.picker.Response.DOCUMENTS][0]           url  doc[google.picker.Document.URL]                  var message  url         document.getElementByIdresult.innerHTML  message                         ltscriptgt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     ltdiv idresultgtltdivgt     ltdiv iddemogt      lt The Google API Loader script. gt     ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpsapis.google.comjsapi.jsonloadonApiLoadgtltscriptgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pBelow is the code that shortens the url, and then upload it to parsep  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt ltheadgt ltscript srchttpwww.parsecdn.comjsparse1.2.12.min.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt function makeShort      var longUrldocument.getElementByIdlongurl.value     var request  gapi.client.urlshortener.url.insert     resource        longUrl longUrl               request.executefunctionresponse                ifresponse.id  null                      str lta hrefresponse.idgtresponse.idltagt             document.getElementByIdoutput.innerHTML  str                Parse.initializeID, ID            var PDFUpload  new Parse.ObjectScan        PDFUpload.setPDFDocument, response.id      PDFUpload.savenull,                success functionuploadResult             Execute any logic that should take place after the object is saved.          ,         error functionuploadResult, error             Execute any logic that should take place if the save fails.            error is a Parse.Error with an error code and description.           alertFailed to create new object, with error code   error.description                                    else                      alerterror creating short url                    function load      gapi.client.setApiKeyAIzaSyDjs47QvxFvnGuh1EJS9JtHe0fXQk9S8 get your ownn Browser API KEY     gapi.client.loadurlshortener, v1,function   window.onload  load  ltscriptgt ltscript srchttpsapis.google.comjsclient.jsgt ltscriptgt  ltbodygt  ltdiv idoutputgtltdivgt  URL ltinput typetext idlongurl nameurl value gt ltbrgt ltinput typebutton valueCreate Short onclickmakeShort gt ltbrgt ltbrgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp

Im changing the size of the photos, width, height to no avail with this theme, but I really like how its all set up. If I  could just change the size and have it work, that would be great. But I feel like the theme has some code preventing me from doing that, or its coming into conflict with something else.p  pIm also attempting to have normal photos pop like photosets, with the larger image appearing upon clicking. The same way photosets do. p  pI am aware this theme does not use the classic lightbox figuration of tumblr, so it emshouldem be relatively simple to do.p  pThanks in advance.p

I have like 30 thousands of NULL ingredientid substances.p  pIs there some code that will match substances with NULL ingredientid with other substances with similar names and then it will somehow copy their ingredient id.

Negative 1456 pI am building an app that on its first run ask for a licensing key to verify with my server and then runs offline afterwards. This app sends some backup data on email when user clicks the backup button. Now that people change the devices every next year i want that I could block the app from running in their old device and give them a new key for their new device.p  pNow the problem is that my app runs offline. It only connects to internet when user want backup of his data. So how can I schedule a background task in my app that runs after every 30 days without users intervention and checks the key status on server. And if user dont have internet connection then app should wait for whenever the internet connection is available and then check the status. App need not to be running for this job. I only want that the app could check the status of the key whenever the net connection is available and then I could do the further things . Any suggestion is most welcome.p

Negative 1456 pIm having enormous problems managing connections in Vertica when developing BIRT reports. The basic idea is that sessions never die, so I always hit the connection cap. This is, of course, a problem, because then you cant use the database at all unless you do a closeallsessions to nuke everyone.p  pThis happens at just about every level of development there is. First, in Esproc, when you develop the underlying logic... if theres a bug in your program before the connection.close, the connection stays open and Esproc opens up a new one next execution. This adds up REALLY quickly when you have a couple of users developing stuff on the network.p  pNext, in Eclipse its the same thing. You open a report and Eclipse creates a dozen connections thatll stay as long as you keep Eclipse open. Then, when you run the report, itll create another bunch of connection, totally ignoring the ones it already has... and if you have bugs in your report, the dozen extras wont close.p  pThen on our website, same thing... problem running the report, boom, connections wont close EVER. Ive had sessions stay open for two weeks with absolutely no activity. They only disappeared when I restarted Tomcat.p  pIm at my whits end here. There doesnt seem to be ANY way to set a session timeout in Vertica and I dont even know where to even begin looking to solve these problems. Everywhere I could find, the connection timeout was set to 20 seconds... so I would expect a connection to disappear after reaching that time, but of course thats not the case.p  pI really have no idea what to do here... and Im desperate for some help here. Can anyone give me a clue Ive been at this for two days now and my brain just cant take anymore.p

Negative 1456 pIm trying to convert the address of a pointer to a wxString of the wxWidgets library. p  pI have this book that presents a console based example to explain the inputoutput stream system in C.

Negative 1456 pI am appending a dictionary into a string and logging it using CLSLog, which is working fine. However, the first word of each string is missing. I am using [[dict allValues] componentsJoinedByStringn], which is what seems to be causing the issue. When I use CLSNSLog, the output is correct. But on the Crashlytics dashboard the output is missing the first word in the String. For example, say the output being logged is DELETED 0 VALUES. In Crashlytics, it appears as 0 VALUES, and DELETED is removed. Any ideas as to what may be causing thisp  pstrongUPDATEstrong After trying [[dict allValues] componentsJoinedByString], removing the n seemed to fix the issue, so the issue does have something to do with the line break.p

Negative 1456 pI know jQuery has a method code.whencode which works both asynchronously and synchronously.p  pIf code.whencode is passed a jQuery promisedeffered it will be asynchronous and the code.thencode or code.donecode etc handler will get passed the promisedeferred, and that will include the asynchronous data in its format.p  pIf code.whencode is passed anything else it will be asynchronous and the code.thencode or code.donecode etc handler will get passed the exact object or anything else you passed to when.p  pNow typically you get to define the synchronous object yourself but thats not always the case for the asynchronous one, which may be returned from some 3rd party web server for instance.p  pThe point of doing this that youre going to transform some data in some way, and sometimes you can do it locally using logic, but other times you need to call out for it if your local stuff cant manage on its own.p  pEither way youre getting a result that youll pass on to the rest of your code via a callback.p  pWhats the correct way to handle both kinds of data in a uniform mannerp  pI suppose I could craft my sync object to look like the object the remote server returns, but that smells bad.p  pOr the code in the callback could sniff the data it gets to see which kind it is, but that also smells bad.p  pIf this seems too simple, imagine the case where either of several 3rd party servers might be called, each of which returns a different format. p  pHeres the kind of thingp  precode.whengetSyncOrAsync7.donefunctionobj     check if obj is in our format    check if its in one.coms format    check if its in two.coms format    code smell how can we get here after normalizing the formats    ... or something ...   function getSyncOrAsyncx    if x lt 3       we can do it ourselves  return an object directly     return  some very, simple object     else if x lt 6       we need to call site number one  return a promisedeferred     return .gethttpone.com  x    else       we need to call site number two  return a promisedeferred     return .gethttptwo.com  x     codepre  pIs there a third way Im too daft to see right now Does it involve trickery with an extra step in the promisedeferred pipeline That seems inefficient but less smelly.

Cannot use the examples version because it expects the data to be uniform every month and only looks at the top result.p  pThe Example i used a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock3887051 relnofollowhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock3887051ap  pMy Code My data is underneathp  precodevar margin  top 20, right 20, bottom 30, left 40,,           width  960  margin.left  margin.right,           height  500  margin.top  margin.bottom          var x0  d3.scale.ordinal           .rangeRoundBands[0, width], .1          var x1  d3.scale.ordinal          var y  d3.scale.linear           .range[height, 0]          var color  d3.scale.ordinal           .range[6fa2dd, 6bda68, a366d6, debd46, 5ab0ca, b755ca, ff8c00]          var xAxis  d3.svg.axis           .scalex0           .orientbottom          var yAxis  d3.svg.axis           .scaley           .orientleft           .tickFormatd3.format.2s          var svg  d3.selectbody.appendsvg           .attrwidth, width  margin.left  margin.right           .attrheight, height  margin.top  margin.bottom         .appendg           .attrtransform, translate  margin.left  ,  margin.top            var data  nestedData          var months  d3.keysdata[0].values.filterfunctionkey  return key  values           var materials             x0.domaindata.mapfunctiond  return d.key          x1.domainmonths.rangeRoundBands[0, x0.rangeBand]         y.domain[0, d3.maxdata, functiond  return d3.maxd.values, function d  return d.values ]         svg.appendg         .attrclass, x axis         .attrtransform, translate0,  height           .callxAxis         svg.appendg         .attrclass, y axis         .callyAxis         .appendtext         .attrtransform, rotate90         .attry, 6         .attrdy, .71em         .styletextanchor, end         .textBoxes         var month  svg.selectAll.month         .datadata         .enter.appendg         .attrclass, g         .attrtransform, functiond  return translate  x0d.key  ,0           month.selectAllrect           .datafunctiond return d.values            .enter.appendrect           .attrwidth, x1.rangeBand           .attrx, functiond  return d.values  30            .attry, functiond  return yd.values            .attrheight, functiond  return height  yd.values            .stylefill, functiond  return colord.key  codepre  pJSON Data Used for Chartp  precode[        key 12015,     values [                key MDF,         values 726       ,                key MAPLE PAINT GRADE,         values 1652       ,                key ALDER,         values 1922       ,                key MAPLE,         values 1206       ,                key POPLAR STAIN GRADE,         values 679       ,                key ALDER  RUSTIC,         values 324       ,                key POPLARMDF,         values 19       ,                key OAK,         values 12            ]   ,        key 42015,     values [                key MAPLE,         values 1982       ,                key MAPLE PAINT GRADE,         values 1988       ,                key MDF,         values 883       ,                key ALDER,         values 1746       ,                key POPLAR STAIN GRADE,         values 639       ,                key ALDER  RUSTIC,         values 367       ,                key OAK,         values 89       ,                key POPLARMDF,         values 24       ,                key CHERRY,         values 0       ,                key HICKORY,         values 1       ,                key WALNUT,         values 20            ]   ,        key 22015,     values [                key MAPLE PAINT GRADE,         values 1758       ,                key ALDER  RUSTIC,         values 339       ,                key ALDER,         values 1551       ,                key MAPLE,         values 1712       ,                key MDF,         values 727       ,                key POPLAR STAIN GRADE,         values 434       ,                key OAK,         values 12       ,                key POPLARMDF,         values 16            ]   ,        key 32015,     values [                key ALDER,         values 1673       ,                key MAPLE PAINT GRADE,         values 2185       ,                key MAPLE,         values 1741       ,                key ALDER  RUSTIC,         values 273       ,                key MDF,         values 1303       ,                key POPLAR STAIN GRADE,         values 533       ,                key POPLARMDF,         values 4       ,                key OAK,         values 17            ]   ,        key 52015,     values [                key ALDER  RUSTIC,         values 155       ,                key ALDER,         values 751       ,                key MAPLE,         values 446       ,                key MAPLE PAINT GRADE,         values 551       ,                key MDF,         values 268       ,                key POPLAR STAIN GRADE,         values 294       ,                key POPLARMDF,         values 7            ]    ] codepre

Negative 1456 pDISCLAIMER I assume cache and environment are the right words here, though I am new to programming, so I may have misunderstood the terminology.p  pI have recently been trying to get to grips with the package fasttime for R, and I realise know there it has a behavior that Ive not seem in documentation and also has been the root of my problems getting it to function.p  pTLDR  If I use fast time to convert to POSIXct from a parent object into child one, then use it in a different way to calculate from the intact parent to child 2, child two will always have the result of child two, even if they should be different when calculated entirely independently. p  pLong version  p  pI have a long list of dates and times as characters to convert into POSIX see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29827948howtomostefficientlyrestructureacharacterstringforfasttimeindatatablthis questionap  pAnd example data set and working file can be a hrefhttpsgithub.comDaveRGPfasttimeError relnofollowfound herea.p  pWhen I read the example file I need to build a single DateTime column, then convert it to POSIXct.p  pFirst I readp  precodesetwdGitHubfasttimeError  example lt freaddatesAndTimes.csv  read example file of dates and times codepre  pThen I pastep  precodeexample[ , DateTime  pasteConsumptionDate, variable]  paste dates with times to make DateTime single column for POSIX conversion codepre  pThen I attempt to convertp  precodelibraryfasttime  load library for fastPOSIXct  test1 lt example[ , DateTime  fastPOSIXctx  DateTime]  this will read the data as starting in 2006  test2 lt example[ , DateTime  fastPOSIXctsubddd ., 312 4, DateTime]  this should produce an identical file to test 1 codepre  pDarn, neither process worked correctly. They both produce a data set starting at 2006.p  pBut for some reason, if I clear the whole working environment in RStudio, and re run the exact same code but SKIP the line that creates codetest1code, then my object labelled codetest2code converts perfectly.p  pWhyp
Negative 1456 pI have a very large, very complicated website.  Like many, it has a lot of common HTML across pages, namely the navigation and top ribbon.p  pA single very complicated page can take up to 300KB of almost exclusively HTML to load.  Of that almost emhalfem is the HTML which is common in the nav and top ribbon.  These elements strongonly ever changestrong when a new version of the site is updated.p  pThe codecontentcode pane of emeveryem page is unique, but again, the nav and top ribbon which account for 50 of the pages data do not change.p  pstrongHow can I speed up my general page load speedsstrong  Ive got two ideas below, but given the site is already emhugeem and very well established, the pros and cons of each possible solution are very important.p  ol liMake jQuery JavaScript store the nav menu in a codecommonhtml.jscode file which populated targeted divs with the 100s of KBs of common data.  Therefore the browser will hopefully cache the codecommonhtml.jscode file and, by not redownloading it ever page, allow the common code to be injected almost instantly.li liUse AJAX loading of the main codecontentcode div, pushing the URL states as changes are made.  This seems to be the common Facebook approach, but applying it to a large, existing website where I am currently the sole dev makes me wonder the difficulty and performance of this approach compared to others.li ol  pWhich of these are better, or strongis there a betterfaster option Im missingstrong  Time to implement is just about as important as performance gains arep

Im interested in seeing how the data changes over time. One idea is to look at the migration path of the dots. I wanted to maybe divide up the graph into little squares and then shade in the squares given how many dots are in that square. So perhaps something like a lattice. Overall I just want to see how the dots move on the lattice over time. What is the best way to visualize this My end goal is to see whats the probability that one dot moves to the next place on the lattice, but thats probably going to come in way later. For now I just want to visualize how the dots move. Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated. p
Negative 1456 pA year back I had to implement a binary search through ranges of IPv4 addresses to work as an optimized HTTP request filter, to counter possible DOS attacks.p  pToday I need to reimplement this to work with IPv6, but due to so many differences in how to convert and compare addresses, this seems to be quite a challenge. Ive tried to find an existing solution for this, but without much luck. At best, I can find simple IPv6 utilities to parse addresses and do very basic manipulation, without much provision for optimized searches. For example, this library a hrefhttpsgithub.comwhitequarkipaddr.js relnofollowwhitequarkipaddr.js ap  pThe key approach in my old solution was to rely on integer presentation of the addresses, using the following conversionp  precodefunction intFromIPv4ip     var octets  ip.split.      return octets[0]  16777216  octets[1]  65536  octets[2]  256  octets[3]  1  codepre  pI then could mergealign IP ranges, so that a simple binary search was possible.p  pAnd heres the class I wrote to do just thatp  precodefunction IPv4Checker       this.ipList  []       takes array of [f,l] integers and returns its mergedrange version as [first, last]      works only if      a the array is ordered by f in ascending order.      b f is always defined, while l is either undefined or not less than f.     this.mergeRanges  function data          var ips  []         if data.length gt 0              var start  data[0].f             var end  data[0].l  start             for var i  1 i lt data.length i                  if data[i].f gt end  1                      var d  first start                     if end gt start                          d.last  end                                          ips.pushd                     start  data[i].f                                  var v  data[i].l  data[i].f                 end  v gt end  v  end                          var d  first start             if end gt start                  d.last  end                          ips.pushd                  return ips            Calculates IP address against the current list,      using binary  logarithmic search algorithm.      It relies on the list of IPs that is ordered by      first in ascending order, and then with all the      range overlaps merged.     this.isValid  function ip          if ip  127.0.0.1              return true  no checks for the local IP                  var addr  intFromIPv4ip         var low  0         var high  this.ipList.length  1         var mid         while low lt high              mid  Math.roundlow  high  2             var a  this.ipList[mid]             if addr gt a.first                  if a.last ampamp addr lt a.last                      return true                                  low  mid  1              else                  if addr lt a.first                      high  mid  1                  else                      return true                                                return false       codepre  pWhat should be the right approach to creating an optimized IPv6 filter with support for ranges, to achieve similar fast search resultp  pIn the end of the day, I just need an IPv6 filter that works fast with either 23 IPv6 ranges or 20003000 IPv6 ranges. Thats because I need to use it on every HTTP request, so use of nonbinary search isnt really an option.p  pAnd if someone can point me at a good existing solution that I may have missed, that would be awesome too.p
Negative 1456 pI am trying to wrap my head around how to have multiple instances of the same Core Data entity. It does not seem possible, so I must be approaching this wrong.p  pBasically, say I have a shopping cart that can be full of multiple balloons. But each balloon can have a different color. If I edit the template for the balloon, all the balloons will update to reflect the change. So say I change the templates name to bacon, all the balloons names will change to bacon as well.p  pHow would I go about achieving this with Core Datap  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAs requested I will try to clarify what I am trying to do.p  pMaybe this example will be more clear.p  pSay you are creating a model for exercises. So you have codeAb Rollercode, codeShoulder Presscode, etc.p  pIn a codeworkoutcode, you may have multiple instances of each. So in one codeworkoutcode you will have, sayp  ol licodeAb Rollercodeli licodeShoulder Presscodeli licodeAb Rollercodeli ol  pAnd each instance of codeAb Rollercode would have its own relationship to codeSetscode which would be different for each of course.p  pMaybe not the best example but should give a clearer understanding of repeating instances. p  pI was thinking of having a codetemplatecode entity, and then an codeinstancecode entity, and a relationship between them  when codetemplatecode entity codenamecode is updated, all codeinstancecode entitys codenamecode update through KVO. Or I place all the shared attributes i.e. codenamecode in the relationship so the codeinstancecode entitys codenamecode attribute returns its codetemplatecodes codenamecode attribute so that they reflect the changes to the codetemplatecode.

Negative 1456 pMy team, is forced to use CITRIX for developing our ASP.NET code, without Admin privileges so we cant use IIS to setup our websites. Were all working on the same website however, for development purposes, wed like to have our own dedicated IIS Express Ports. The problem is, by changing the IIS Express ports, were modifying our project settings so when we push our code to the source control, everyone else has to deal with the obvious merging problemp  pIm wondering if theres a better way, so we can all work in Citrix in peace and harmony without any access to IIS restricted to IIS Express only and have our own Port s without impacting others projects settingsp  pOf course, if we had access to IIS, we all would create our own webport and point it to our own code.p  pTo be perfectly clear, using Citrix they all work off of Cdevname folderp  precodeJohn works on CdevJohnwebsite Joe works on CdevJoewebsite Jeff works on cdevJeffwebsite  John wants to point his iis express to web2222 Joe wants to point his iis express to web3333 Jeff wants to point his iis express to web4444 codepre  pthey all push their code to source control, so changing the IIS Express setting in their project causes chaosp  pif they had access to IIS, they would all create 3 different web projects in IIS so project settings wouldnt be an issue. p  pLooking forward to a solution to this  many thanksp
Negative 1456 pI am currently looking at the various parts of the CPU pipeline which can detect branch mispredictions. I have found these arep  ol liBranch Target Buffer BPU CLEARli liBranch Address Calculator BA CLEARli liJump Execution Unit not sure of the signal name hereli ol  pI know what 2 and 3 detect, but I do not understand what misprediction is detected within the BTB.

The execution unit evaluates the branch and determines if it was correct.p  pstrongWhat type of misprediction is detected at the Branch Target Buffer What exactly is detected as a misprediction herestrongp  pThe only clue I could find was this inside Vol 3 of the Intel Developer Manuals the two BPU CLEAR event counters at the bottomp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOJEr1.png altenter image description herep  blockquote   pBPU predicted a taken branch after incorrectly assuming that it was   not taken.p blockquote  pThis seems to imply the prediction is not done synchronously, but rather asynchronously, hence the after incorrectly assumingp  pUPDATEp  pRoss, this is the CPU branch circuitry, from the original Intel Patent hows that for readingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2Y3jy.png altenter image description herep  pI dont see Branch Prediction Unit anywhere Would it be reasonable that somebody having read this paper would assume that BPU is a lazy way of grouping the BTB Circuit, BTB Cache, BAC and RSB togetherp  pSo my question still stands, which component raises the BPU CLEAR signalp

Negative 1456 plet me start off by saying Im a very novice coder, but i have done thorough searches on here and other places before asking anything....and I basically know whats wrong with my website, but nothing I have tried so far has seemed to work.p  pIm making a gaming clan one pager website for my friend as my first official live website....I decided to use a modified bootstrap theme instead of starting from scratch since Im still very new at this....p  pthe website url is a hrefhttpwww.darknessmilitia.com relnofollowwww.darknessmilitia.comap  pOne of the main problems Ive been having from the very beginning is that when you click on any of the links in the nav, it stays active color even when you continue scrolling down the page, and if you accidentally double click the link, the scrolling gets all glitched out for a few seconds, almost like you are playing tugofwar with the jquery scrolling animation....p  pAll of the other bugs I have spotted are on the mobile viewport only. p  p1.The roster paneltable gets cut short when viewed sideways on mobile devicep  ol start2 liCant figure out how to make the roster collapse upward while in unsticky mode, since its at the bottom of the page when you first load in....if this isnt possible I want to somehow make it barely below the viewport and force them to click the button to scroll down first and stick the nav on top.li ol  p3.the navigation menu on mobile doesnt close once a link has been clicked....its not that much of a problem until you try to login, the modal gets put behind the nav menu. I suppose I could just change the zindex of the modal, but I would prefer to make it go away when a link is clicked.p  pI apologize in advance if my code is a bit of a mess, Im trying my best p  pThanks for reading, any advice is much appreciatedp

Negative 1456 pIve recently been experimenting with Jison, and I thought I would try to create a grammar which is able to at least partially parse some math expressions.p  pHowever, now Im confused about how I could go about creating a rule that would allow for multiplication of the form code7acode for example where codeacode is a previously defined variable. I attempted to do this with codeadjmulcode in my code, but the parser does not work unless there is a space present between code7code and codeacode.

Negative 1456 pMy task is to dump a large mssql table into a csv file to be uploaded elsewhere. The task needs to run nightly or on any scheduled basis, and it should also be executable on demand from a web page. The csv conversion must be done in Java. p  pThis is something Ive never implemented, but it seems like a very common need. From my Google research, I came up with two options. But I have no idea if these have obvious pitfalls, or if there are obvious and superior implementation options that I am unaware of. So I could really use some informed feedbackadvice on how to approach this. p  ol lipExecute my Java application in a web services container, something like Apache Tomcat. The application would just run and to do its business logic on whatever schedule, and Tomcat would make it easily accessible from a web page. But this just seems like overkill, to setup and maintain a Tomcat installation.pli lipPackage my Java program a jar, and setup a Jenkins job I have access to a Jenkins server installation to execute the main class on whatever schedule. And create Jenkins jobs in php or something as needed to do on demand executions. This seems like a very clean and easy option, are there any obvious pitfalls that Im missingpli ol  pThere are so many tools for this job, no idea how to pick the right one.p  pAlso, any general advice on how to convert the table to csv in a memory safe and time efficient manner would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1456 pDuring some experiment with a hrefhttpswww.elastic.coblogsupportinthewildmybiggestelasticsearchproblematscale relnofollowfielddata vs docvaluesa I encountered a weird case. In my earlier mapping, I didnt use doc values at all. In my new mapping, Ive added codedocvalues truecode to all fields in my mapping, except analyzed string fields and booleans a hrefhttpsgithub.comelasticelasticsearchissues7851 relnofollownot supported until 2.0a.p  pSo in details, here is how I proceededp  pBefore reindexing all my data, I restarted my ES 1.7 cluster fresh and ran a query with sorting, aggregations and script fields to warm up the fielddata cache. Then I queried the codefielddatacode endpoint to have an idea of the fielddata cache usage. It looked something like thisp  precodecurl XGET localhost9200catfielddatavampfields  id      host   ip            node  total  items.desc.raw morefields... rKX7... myhost 192.168.1.100 Doom  32.9mb 2.3mb          ... codepre  pAs you can see, the field codeitems.desc.rawcode used 2.3mb of heap space. codeitemscode is of type codenestedcode and contains a string multifield with a codenotanalyzedcode subfield called coderawcode. In short, the mapping of that nested field looks like thisp  precode    items        type nested,       properties          desc            type string,           fields              raw                type string,               index notanalyzed                                              codepre  pAfter adding codedocvalues truecode to codeitems.desc.rawcode, reindexing the whole index and running some aggregations, sorting and scripting again to warm up the fielddata cache, I queried the codefielddatacode endpoint again and here was the resultp  precodecurl XGET localhost9200catfielddatavampfields  id      host   ip            node  total  items.desc.raw somebools... tAB5... myhost 192.168.1.100 Yack  2.1mb  9.2kb          ... codepre  pSo the fielddata usage has indeed been drastically lowered which is good, the only fields I see are boolean fields i.e. codesomeboolscode above which was expected, but to my surprise my nested codenotanalyzedcode string field also appeared, but with a much lower space usage.p  pWhat could be the cause of codeitems.desc.rawcode still appearing in the fielddata cachep

Negative 1456 pI know in Django that I can view all SQL statements as logs using codedjango.db.backendscode as a logger in my codesettings.pycode. However, I dont know of a good way to know which SQL statement came from which Django script and function that I wrote. Ive looked into codeq.assqlcode and codeq.sqlwithparamscode, where codeqcode is a queryset, and Ive tried to log each querysets SQL statements using these. p  pHowever, it seems like these functions are for older versions of Django that arent supported anymore Ive also tried to give the codedjango.db.backendscode logger a handler whose format includes filename and function, but the filename is always codeutils.pycode, which I assume is the Django script that either does the logging or does the execution of the SQL. What Im trying to do is modify the SQL logs that codedjango.db.backendscode produces so that, for example, if I do this kind of queryp  pcodeval, created  Value.objects.getorcreatevaltypeintcodep  pin a function codeinsertIntoDatabasecode in a file named codedatabaseinserter.pycode, the logs will not only show the raw SQL involved in that query but also show me that the SQL statement came from the function codeinsertIntoDatabasecode from the file codedatabaseinserter.pycode. How can I achieve this It would be great to have the SQL logs also log the line number of what Django code caused what SQL statement.p

Henceforth, the body of emouterfooem will be unreachable, and all subsequent calls to the function named codefoocode will result in the execution of eminnerfooem.p  pIn general, one may envision some variations on this pattern sup1sup, but the essential constraints on the basic scheme Im talking about here arep  ol licodefoocode is redefined exactly once during the execution of codeouterfoocodesup2supli licodefoocode is never redefined during the execution of codeinnerfoocode.li ol  pIf these essential constraints are violated, all bets are off such a case is outside the scope of this question.p  hr  pI am already aware of at least one downside of this scheme some practitioners consider selfredefining functions confusing, detrimental to code readability, andor inherently in poor taste, even when the redefinition happens only once in a completely deterministic manner, as is the case in the scheme above.p  pMy question isp  blockquote   pDoes this scheme have any strongadditionalstrong downsides, and if so, what are theyp      pIm particularly interested in those downsides that are specific to JavaScript.p blockquote  hr  psupsup1sup For example,supp  precodefunction foo  aka outerfoo        var innerfoo, ... ltCLOSUREVARSgt ...      if  somedeterministictest           innerfoo  function  arg0, ...                etc.                   else          innerfoo  function  arg0, ...                etc.                     foo  innerfoo      return foo.apply this, arguments   codepre  psupIn this variant, the function ultimately assigned to codefoocode depends on some test performed at runtime.supp  psup sup2sup Here its tempting to stipulate that codefoocode not only must be redefined exactly once within emouterfooem, but that this be done deterministically.  Of course, any deviation from determinism however one chooses to define it in final setting of codefoocode can only increase the complexity of the codes runtime behavior.  Unfortunately, I dont know how to make this stipulation precise without descending into a maze of lawyerly minutiae.  The best I could do would be to add the weaselymdashand borderline incoherentmdashphrase the more deterministic the better, and hope that readers get my point.  The only utility of this additional stipulation, however, would be to rule out perverse, but wholly unrealistic, scenarios e.g. having the final value of codefoocode depend on the outcome of a random process, so I left it out.supp

Negative 1456 pI found code on stackoverflow that was voted really highly when someone asked for code to perform a quick sort algorithm a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvaQiWF4E8flQ relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvaQiWF4E8flQa.  After testing it multiple times, it does in fact work, and it works quickly.  However, Im just trying to understand the logic behind the code.  A quick sort should choose a pivot, sort all lower numbers to the left of that pivot and all higher numbers to the right of that pivot, and then make a recursive call to each subarray.  This code does not accomplish that before making each recursive call.  I have modified the code to demonstrate this.  The array will dump on your worksheet after each recursive call.  As you can see, pivots 2, 6, and 4 are not correctly placed until the emnextem recursive call.p  precodeSub Quicksort  Dim qsort1 To 9 As Integer  qsort1  6  qsort2  5  qsort3  1  qsort4  3  qsort5  8  qsort6  4  qsort7  7  qsort8  9  qsort9  2      ActiveSheet.Cells1, 1.Value  Original      For x  1 To 9          ActiveSheet.Cellsx  1, 1.Value  qsortx      Next x  Call QuicksortCont1, 9, qsort, 3  End Sub   Sub QuicksortContByVal inLow As Integer, ByVal inHi As Integer, ByRef qsort As Integer, ByRef col As Integer  Dim pivot As Variant Dim qswap As Integer Dim swap1 As String Dim swap2 As Double Dim r As Integer Dim tmpLow As Integer, tmphi As Integer  tmpLow  inLow tmphi  inHi  pivot  qsortinHi  ActiveSheet.Cells1, col.Value  Pivot   amp pivot  r  0  While tmpLow lt tmphi     While qsorttmpLow lt pivot And tmpLow lt inHi       tmpLow  tmpLow  1    Wend     While pivot lt qsorttmphi And tmphi gt inLow       tmphi  tmphi  1    Wend     If tmpLow lt tmphi Then        hold variables        qswap  qsorttmpLow          replace low with high        qsorttmpLow  qsorttmphi          replace high with low using variables        qsorttmphi  qswap          tmpLow  tmpLow  1        tmphi  tmphi  1     End If      Debug.Print       For x  1 To 9          ActiveSheet.Cells10  r  x  1, col.Value  qsortx      Next x      r  r  1  Wend  col  col  2  If inLow lt tmphi Then QuicksortCont inLow, tmphi, qsort, col If tmpLow lt inHi Then QuicksortCont tmpLow, inHi, qsort, col  End Sub codepre
Negative 1456 pIve used strongCOM addinsstrong for some years and Ive observed that often strongnew versionsstrong were the cause of serious issues including crashes at strongExcelstrong startup or when strongCOM componentsstrong are used.p  pFrom what I understand this is due to the internal Excel plumbing caching some information about the COM addin inside the XLSXLSXXLAXLAM file that dont match its new versions e.g. if a new method has been added to the API, or a new parameter has been added to a method.p  pThis is really annoying as it forces us to remove the references in the strongVBA editorstrong emTools  Referencesem menu, close the popup, and add them back, which AFAIK forces Excel to resync with the current state of the addin.p  pA simple fix would be to add a hook on emWorkbookOpenem, for each distributed workbook, to automatically remove, if it exists, then add each reference back.p  pDo you have any otherbetter idea p

But when I try the crawling I get an import error that regex module not found So does that mean I cannot do the data cleaning in the spider Do i have a to write a separate class for it p  pAny suggestions  p
