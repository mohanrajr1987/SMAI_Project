Positive 3890 pI have got a JavaFX application with a border pane. The menu is in the top part, the content in the center part of the border pane. From the menu different parts of the application can be choosen and are then displayed in the center part. Each such part is inside a Scrollpane. Unfortunately the scrollpane either does not show at all until the window is resized. Or the content of the scrollpane can not be scrolled down to the bottom until the window is resized. How can I update the scrollpane without resizing the window When the window is in is maximized state the problem does not occure. Also I did a .setMaxWidth and .setMaxHeight on the stage. When I remove that code the problem does not occure either. Could the problem be a bug thenp

However when I run the app on Windows, the app window doesnt render properly only the border and title of the window appear, and the inside is a copy of the background.

Positive 3890 pI would like the user of my JavaFX app to be able to edit a text config file while running the app.  Whats the best way to bring up a text file in JavaFX I tried java.awt.Desktop.getDesktop.edit on two systems Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7 and in both it fails.  On Ubuntu it fails with the message java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException The EDIT action is not supported on the current platform On Windows Caused by java.io.IOException Failed to edit application.properties. Error message No application is associated with the specified file for this operation.  I guess I could associate an application for this operation but I would like something that works almost always without setting up the users machine and works independently of the target OS.p

The teacher only tells us to Google it so thats no help either..p  pBasically, were working on a basic administration application to keep track of people and their families. Where people are member of a family, and a family can have multiple members.p  pWhen a person or family is added, they are added to an observableList which emshouldem then update an ArrayList So the data can be serialized and a GUI element.

Positive 3890 p Hi everyonep  pI am totally new to audio programming and would like to build a Java FX application that interact with audio from my microphone or line out.p  pI searched google for libraries and found minim which seems pretty popular. It is written for processing but you are able to use it in Java as well. The problem is that I did not find that good documentation about how to do this. The reason that I do not want to use processing is that I want to build a pretty advance gui, and I think it is easier to do in JavaFX.p  pAs a first step I am trying to build a library that reacts on every beat in a song.

Positive 3890 pMaking progress with my board game, so on a mouse click, some tasks will be performed like playing some animations, receiving new panes for the board I asked about this my last question, works great now, making changes to player data etc.p  pSo, here is my EventHandlerp  precodegrid.setOnMouseReleasednew EventHandlerltMouseEventgt       public void handleMouseEvent me          make changes to player data         receive new panes for the board         make some gui changes         play some animations       codepre  pHere codegridcode is a GridPane object, which contains other panes for each cell of the board, panes for animation etc.p  pOne mouse event would take 23 seconds to be handled. While this is going on, I saw that another mouse click would also start being handled parallel with the one already ongoing.p  pWhat I want is that another mouse event should not be processed until the first one has been completed. It would be better if, any clicks if received would be discarded.p  pI tried to use threadingp  precodegrid.setOnMouseReleasednew EventHandlerltMouseEventgt       public void handleMouseEvent me          Thread t  new Threadnew Runnable              public void run                  completing the necessary tasks here                               t.start         t.join       codepre  pBut GUI changes would not occur if I use threading dont know why, I tested it in many different ways, always failed to make GUI changes, so this would not work I guess.p  pSo what could I do to not take in any mouse clicks while one mouse event is being handled I think this question doesnt require more code, but if necessary, I would edit and add some code.p  pEDITp  precodeclass Animations      public Pane getAnimationPane          returns Pane which would be used for transition           public void playAnimation          called only when the timeline transition is to be played       codepre  pSo I made an array of the Animations class because I need a lot of such panes and need to keep a track of each one of them.p  pWhen I need to play the animation, I call the codeplayAnimationcode method.p  pNow this codeplayAnimationcode method is like an animationinception.p  pAfter an animation on this pane is completed, changes are made to the board according to the players progress, and if required... this codeplayAnimationcode method would call the codeplayAnimationcode method of several other Animation objects.p  precodegrid.setOnMouseReleasednew EventHandlerltMouseEventgt       public void handleMouseEvent me          make changes to player data         receive new panes for the board         make some gui changes         play some animations         someAnimationObject.playAnimation       codepre  pThis could go as deep as 1020 more, if the grid size is large other Animation objects being used for their codeplayAnimationcode.p  pEDIT 2p  pThe codeplayAnimationcode of codeAnimationscode could call codeplayAnimationcode on 08 other Animations objects. And this could keep on going.p

Positive 3890 pIm trying to combine 3 features into a single JavaFX class. My first feature displays WELCOME TO JAVA around in a circle. The second displays a 10x10 matrix of random 1s and 0s.

Negative 3890 pIm a PHP developer, but honestly my knowledge of server management is somewhat lacking. I fired off a script today that took a regrettably long time to run, and because it had an embedded call to codeignoreuserabortcode, pressing stop in the browser was obviously futile.

Negative 3890 pIve made some performance improvements to my applications backend, and to show the benefit to the end users of the GUI, weve been using the Trace.axd page to take timings. The frontend is .Net 1.1 and the backend is Java, connected via Web services.p  pHowever, these timings show no difference between the old and the new backends.p  pBy putting a breakpoint in the backend and holding a request there for 30 seconds, I can see from Trace.axd that the POST is taking 3ms, and the GET is taking 4s.

This means that when I e.g. remove a child, I get holes in the children list after saving to the database and fetching the parent again.

Negative 3890 pI have a servlet based application for serving stored documents and images.  The images were all stored as jpg with standard sizes based on corporate standards at the time the system was designed.  Now, the image sizes that users want to see have changed.  Since there are many images that wont need to be resized, we have built a service to resize images on the fly based on an additional request parameter.  The new file will then be saved for future requests.p  pThe files can be resized using java, but JMagick resizing often produces a better looking image.  The problem with JMagick is that a dll has to be loaded.  This works for local testing where there is access to the servers the system path can be changed to add the directory containing the dll.p  pIs there a way to get the JMagick dll loaded from within the application so that JMagick will work within a Websphere environment or is there another alternative that will produce a comparable quality imagep

Negative 3890 pI run across a lot of embarrassingly parallel projects Id like to parallelize with the codemultiprocessingcode module. However, they often involve reading in huge files greater than 2gb, processing them line by line, running basic calculations, and then writing results. Whats the best way to split a file and process it using Pythons multiprocessing module Should codeQueuecode or codeJoinableQueuecode in codemultiprocessingcode be used Or the codeQueuecode module itself Or, should I map the file iterable over a pool of processes using codemultiprocessingcode Ive experimented with these approaches but the overhead is immense in distribution the data line by line. Ive settled on a lightweight pipefilters design by using codecat file  process1 outfile out1 numprocesses 2  process2 outfile out2code, which passes a certain percentage of the first processs input directly to the second input see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions659865pythonmultiprocessingsharingalargereadonlyobjectbetweenprocesses659888659888this posta, but Id like to have a solution contained entirely in Python. p  pSurprisingly, the Python documentation doesnt suggest a canonical way of doing this despite a lengthy section on programming guidelines in the codemultiprocessingcode documentation.p  pThanks, Vincep  pAdditional information Processing time per line varies. Some problems are fast and barely not IO bound, some are CPUbound. The CPU bound, nondependent tasks will gain the post from parallelization, such that even inefficient ways of assigning data to a processing function would still be beneficial in terms of wall clock time.p  pA prime example is a script that extracts fields from lines, checks for a variety of bitwise flags, and writes lines with certain flags to a new file in an entirely new format. This seems like an IO bound problem, but when I ran it with my cheap concurrent version with pipes, it was about 20 faster. When I run it with pool and map, or queue in codemultiprocessingcode it is always over 100 slower. p

Negative 3890 pPython seems to have a hrefhttpwiki.python.orgmoinParallelProcessing relnofollowmany different packages availablea to assist one in parallel processing on an SMP based system or across a cluster.  Im interested in building a client server system in which a server maintains a queue of jobs and clients local or remote connect and run jobs until the queue is empty.  Of the packages listed above, which is recommended and whyp  pEdit In particular, I have written a simulator which takes in a few inputs and processes things for awhile.  I need to collect enough samples from the simulation to estimate a mean within a user specified confidence interval.  To speed things up, I want to be able to run simulations on many different systems, each of which report back to the server at some interval with the samples that they have collected.  The server then calculates the confidence interval and determines whether the client process needs to continue.  After enough samples have been gathered, the server terminates all client simulations, reconfigures the simulation based on past results, and repeats the processes.p  pWith this need for intercommunication between the client and server processes, I question whether batchscheduling is a viable solution.  Sorry I should have been more clear to begin with.p

So I find myself in the situation where I have a class which composes objects of a class it inherits from, which just doesnt seem right. But at the same time, I dont see why the higher level code shouldnt be able to treat CompositeParameters and Parameters exactly the same.p  pThe only option I can think of is to have CompositeParameter simply compose Parameters, and the higher level code would only deal with CompositeParameters.

Negative 3890 pI know there are plenty of questions here already about this topic Ive read through as many as I could find, but I havent yet been able to figure out how best to satisfy my particular criteria. Here are the goalsp  ol lipThe ASP.NET application will run on a few different web servers, including localhost workstations for development. sThis means encrypting web.config using a machine key is out.s Each type or environment of web server dev, test, prod has its own corresponding database dev, test, prod. We want to separate these connection strings so that a developer working on the dev code is not able to see any prod connection string passwords, nor allow these production passwords to ever get deployed to the wrong server or committed to SVN.pli lipThe application swills should be able to decide which connection string to attempt to use based on the server name using a switch statement. For example, localhost and dev.example.com swills should know to use the DevDatabaseConnectionString, test.example.com will use the TestDatabaseConnectionString, and www.example.com will use the ProdDatabaseConnectionString, for example. The reason for this is to limit the chance for any deployment accidents, where the wrong type of web server connects to the wrong database.pli lipIdeally, the exact same executables and web.config should be able to run on any of these environments, without needing to tailor or configure each environment separately every time that we deploy something that seems like it would be easy to forgetmess up one day during a deployment, which is why we moved away from having just one connectionstring that has to be changed on each target. Deployment is currently accomplished via FTP. emUpdateem Using build events  and revising our deployment procedures is probably not a bad idea.pli lipsWe will not have commandline access to the production web server. This means using aspnetregiis.exe to encrypt the web.config is out.s emUpdateem We can do this programmatically so this point is moot.pli lipWe would prefer to not have to recompile the application whenever a password changes, so using web.config or db.config or whatever seems to make the most sense.pli lipA developer should not be able to get to the production database password. If a developer checks the source code out onto their localhost laptop which would determine that it should be using the DevDatabaseConnectionString, remember and the laptop gets lost or stolen, it should not be possible to get at the other connection strings. Thus, having a single RSA private key to unencrypt all three passwords cannot be considered. Contrary to 3 above, it does seem like wed need to have three separate key files if we went this route these could be installed once per machine, and should the wrong key file get deployed to the wrong server, the worst that should happen is that the app cant decrypt anythingand not allow the wrong host to access the wrong databasepli lipUPDATEADDENDUM The app has several separate webfacing components to it a classic ASMX Web Services project, an ASPX Web Forms app, and a newer MVC app. In order to not go mad having the same connection string configured in each of these separate projects for each separate environment, it would be nice to have this only appear in one place. Probably in our DAL class library or in a single linked config file. pli ol  pI know this is probably a subjective question asking for a best way to do something, but given the criteria Ive mentioned, Im hoping that a single best answer will indeed arise.  p  pThank youp
Negative 3890 pFrom the SEO standpoint it is nice to see urls in format which explains what is located on a page Lets have a look on such situation it is just example We need to display page about some product and decided to have such url template for that page codeproductProductIdProductCategoryProductUrlNamecode.  And create for this purpose such modelp  precodepublic class ProductUrlInfo    public int ProductIdgetset    public string ProductCountrygetset    public string ProductUrlNamegetset  codepre  pI want to create controller method where I pass ProductUrlInfo object but not all required fields. Classic controller method for url template shown above is followingp  precodepublic ActionResult Indexint ProductId, string ProductCategory, string ProductUrlName     return View  codepre  pand we need to call it like that  codeHtml.ActionLinkltUserControllergtxgtIndexuser.ProductId, user.ProductCategory, user.ProductUrlName, See user pagecodep  pI want to create such controller methodp  precodepublic ActionResult IndexProductUrlInfo productInfo     return View  codepre  pand call it like that codeHtml.ActionLinkltProductControllergtxgtIndexproduct, See product pagecodep  pActually I works when we add one more route and point it to the same controller method, so routing will be code productproductInfo productProductIdProductCategoryProductUrlNamecode In this situation routing engine gets string method of our model need to override it and it works ALMOST always. But sometimes it fails and show url like pageproductInfoCarsPorsche911p  pSo my workaround does not always work properly. Does anybody know how to work with urls in such wayp  pstrongEditstrong Maybe it was unclear, sorry... ProductUrlInfo is strongNOTstrong a view model. That is an object which created just to be shown in the url ONLY. Example of all object for such productp  precodepublic class ProductList ListltProductgt  public class Product    public int ProductIdgetset    public string ProductCountrygetset    public string ProductNamegetset    public string Heightgetset    public float Pricegetset     data which must be rendered in the url string    public ProductUrlInfo Key       return new ProductUrlInfo         ProductId  this.ProductId         ,ProductCountry  MyConverter.EncodeForUrlthis.ProductCountry         ,ProductUrlName MyConverter.EncodeForUrlthis.ProductName              codepre  pSomewhere on a View control p  precodeforeach var pr in Model    Html.RenderActionLinkltProductControllergtxgtIndexpr.Key, See product page codepre  pController methods should be like thisp  precodeaccept our complex object as a key public ActionResult IndexProductUrlInfo key     retrive data from database or any other stuff     Product pr  Repository.GetProductByKeykey     return Viewpr   accept our complex object as a key public ActionResult EditProductUrlInfo key     retrive data from database or any other stuff     Product pr  Repository.GetProductByKeykey     return Viewpr   [HttpPost] public ActionResult EditProduct product     do update here  codepre  pLet me explain how it passed to  codeIndexProductUrlInfo keycode controller method. I think that Im using some side effect. But at first if you have several items you want to pass to controller and actually only single item is object primary key i.e. object ID and other elements just explain user which page he has opened some additional information i.e. object category and name. So in a future you might want to change this information add new fields remove old etc. But if you have links to that page from all over the project then it may be quite painful to completely replace links to new format. So why not pass to controller some model which then be rendered into url I investigated that if you can do following steps to pass custom object to controller 1. create class which contains all required fields to be shown in url  ProductUrlInfo class herep  ol lipregister route with your actually passed object in my particular case it is emkeyem pli liphere some magic. Register AFTER that your desired url format routes emidCategoryProductUrlNameem and for example emidProductUrlNameem You might want to  render only name if it is unknown its category for some reasonpli lipoverride codeToStringcode method in codeProductUrlInfocode class and it must render your desired url format. i.e.p  ppublic override string ToStringbr br   return String.IsNullOrEmptyCategorybr     string.Format 012, Id, Category, ProductUrlName br     string.Format 01, Id, ProductUrlName  p  pAs I do understand that effect when routing engine gets passed object it looks for appropriate route and found key string. Then it found that passed object is a complex type and calls its ToString method. But its not  blindly set result instead of key parameter but also compares it  against routes. Now if you pass ProductUrlInfo into ActionLink as a parameter you will be tranfered to  IndexProductUrlInfo key controller method.  Of course it looks for me as a hack so Id like to know is there anybody who passes objects into GET controller method but in some other better waypli ol

Negative 3890 pIve got a fairly long list in a ComboBox, and I want the DropDown behavior to be different.p  pNormally, when you click the arrow, the list expands showing all options, starting with the selected option. Options listed above the selected option are hidden, but can be seen by scrolling up.p  pI want the list to scroll up a bit, showing the selected option in the middle of the list, whenever possible.p  pIve seen ways to do this in a Scrollbar enabled FlowLayoutPanel, but Ive had no luck with the DDL.  The list is over 50 items long, so simply showing the whole list isnt practical.p
Negative 3890 pSo, I have three numpy arrays which store latitude, longitude, and some property value on a grid  that is, I have LATy,x, LONy,x, and, say temperature Ty,x, for some limits of x and y.  The grid isnt necessarily regular  in fact, its tripolar.p  pI then want to interpolate these property temperature values onto a bunch of different latlon points stored as lat1t, lon1t, for about 10,000 t... which do not fall on the actual grid points.  Ive tried matplotlib.mlab.griddata, but that takes far too long its not really designed for what Im doing, after all.  Ive also tried scipy.interpolate.interp2d, but I get a MemoryError my grids are about 400x400.p  pIs there any sort of slick, preferably fast way of doing this  I cant help but think the answer is something obvious...

Negative 3890 pI am currently developing a site that users the jQuery superfish plugin to construct a 3 level deep drop down menu with rounded corners, drop shadows and all of that other head banging, screen smashing, anger inciting stuff us web developers love.p  pThe client is using IE8, and IE7 as well. At the end of each menu, I am placing a 24bit rounded transparent image at the end for the rounded corners at the bottom of the menu. So my code is as followsp  precodeltul idnavgt  ltligtlta hrefgtItem oneltagtltligt  ltligtlta hrefgtItem oneltagtltligt  ltligtlta hrefgtItem oneltagtltligt  ltligt   lta hrefgtItem oneltagt   ltulgt    ltligt     lta hrefgtAnother itemltagt    ltligt    ltli classlastli2gtltimg srcimageslastli2.png gtltligt   ltulgt  ltligt  ltli classlastligtltimg srcimageslastli.png gtltligt ltulgt codepre  pAs you can see I am not using background images on the last elements as they are just images inside of LI elements. When hovering in IE7 and IE8 I presume IE6 as well you see a flicker of the last image like it is loading or something. Ive tried preloading the images, but that doesnt seem to make a difference whatsoever. If the image is in the markup it should be loading anyway.p  pSo my question is, how can I stop an image flickering in my nav that isnt a background image Its almost like it could be a transparency thing as well, but I wouldnt even know where to start.p  pemstrongem Update strongp  pI solved the issue. It was the fade effect on the menu that was causing the lag. I removed the FX and the issue was solved. Thank you to all those who helped.p

Negative 3890 pIm trying to run a piece of code on a large computer cluster in order to analyze different parts of the data.p  pI created 2 loops to assign the jobs to different nodes and the cpus that the nodes contain. The analysis function I wrote, chnJob, just needs to take an index to know what part of the data it needs to analyze its the shell variable called chn in this case.p  pthe loop is like thisp  precodefor NODE in NODES do  Loop through nodes    for jobidx in 1..PROCSPERNODE do  Loop through jobs per node 8 per node       echo this is the channel chn       ssh NODE matlab nodisplay nodesktop nojvm nosplash r cd WORKDIR chnJobchn quit amp       let chn       sleep 2   done done codepre  pEven though I see that chn variable is being incremented properly, the value of chn that is passed to the matlab function is always the last value of the chn. p  pThis is probably because matlab takes a lot of time to open on each node and bash finishes the loops by then. So the value that is being passed to each matlab instance is only the last value.p  pIs there a way to circumvent that Can I bake the value of that variable when Im calling the functionp  pOr is the problem entirely differentp

Negative 3890 pMy project uses a static library from an external supplier, codelibext.acode. The library is kept in a central location shared among all the project developers, codecentralcode, and with each updated release of the library, the new file with a suffix of the current version is added codecentrallibext.a.1code, codecentrallibext.a.2code, codecentrallibext.a.3code, ...p  pThe projects Subversion repository contains a symbolic link, codelibext.acode, that points to the latest version of the library in codecentralcode. Whenever a new version is added, the link is changed and committed to the repository.p  pThe problem is that when recompiling the project after the link was changed and the working copy updated, codemakecode looks at the modification time of the links target, and not at the modification time of the link itself codelibext.acode.  So the library used in effect in the compiled project is still the old version.p  pI am aware of the codeLcodecodechecksymlinktimescode flag available in strongGNU Makestrong since version 3.81, which makes codemakecode look at the modification times of both the links target and the link itself, but my project uses version 3.80, and upgrading would be very difficult as compilation has to be supported on many different machines, of some of which I have no control.p  pWhat is the most simple way to emulate the behavior of this new flag in my older version of codemakecode I prefer something that can be local to a specific Makefile and implemented within it, not a script that has to be run before running codemakecode or a command line option that has to be specified with it, although it is not completely unacceptable.p

Negative 3890 pOf course there is the obvious way of using synchronized. But Im creating a system designed for running on several cores and writing to that file various times at the same milisecond. So I believe that using synchronize will hurt performance badly. I was thinking of using the Pipe class of java but not sure if it will help or having each thread write to a different file and an additional thread collecting those writings, creating the final result. I should mention that the order of the writings isnt important and it is timestamped in nanotime anyway. What is the better idea of those two have any other suggestions thanks.p

Negative 3890 pIm implementing a gpu based cloth simulation using massspring model with a backward euler integration. The linear system is solved by using the conjugate gradient solver with filter. Everything is done in GPU.  I think as an implicit integration it should be stable like many paper pointed out, but it is unstable just like  the emplicit method. Most of time, when the time step size reaches a certain value depending on the stiffness, the CG refuses to converge and goes into a infinite loop.p  pAlthough Ive checked the code over and over again and read many papers, I still couldnt find out the reason. The cloth moves correctly and the animation is much more convincible than the one using explicit integration, so i guess  the forces are computed correctly. Is there anything I missed to cause the instabilityp  pIve been tackled by this strange problem for days......br Any one can help any suggestion i would really appreciatep  pthanks alot in advance  p

Negative 3890 pIm working on a research problem out of curiosity, and I dont know how to program the logic that Ive in mind.

The problem is now I want to add each of these vectors one vector from v1, v2, v3, v4 which it hasnt added before. For examplep  pv3 and v4 hasnt been added to v12, so I want to create v123 and v124. Similarly for all the vectors like,p  precodev12 should become v123  v12v3 v124  v12v4  v13 should become v132  This should not occur because I already have v123 v134  v14 should become v142  Cannot occur because Ive v124 already v143  Cannot occur  v23 should become v231  Cannot occur v234 ... and so on. codepre  pIt is important that I do not do all at one step at the start.

Negative 3890 pIve been reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions569940whatsthebestwaytocommunicatebetweenviewcontrollersthisa thread on StackOverflow about dependency injection and am really keen to use the ideas given by the top rated answer. However, Im having trouble extending them to work in my case and have looked everywhere for a solution but have had no luck.p  pTo illustrate my situation in the simplest terms, lets say I havep  pViewController A  In which the user picks a photobr ViewController B  In which the user then picks a colourbr ViewController C  In which the image and colour are displayed back to the user  p  pI can see how I can use dependancy injection to specify that ViewController A should push ViewController B to the navigation controller once a photo has been selected, but where should I store the photo that was selected How should I make it available to ViewController C to displayp  pAlso, how should I tell ViewController B that it needs to push ViewController C when a colour has been pickedp  pThe only solution I can think of which strictly follows the ideas of the above thread is to have a photo property on ViewController B which gets set by ViewController A when it pushes it to the navigation controller. But this seems like a bad idea to me because in general ViewController B should have no interest in photographs whatsoever as its sole purpose in life is to pick a colour and move on.p  pIn trying to solve this I have come up with 2 possibilitiesp  pem1 Make all ViewControllers report back to a central delegate.em  p  pThis seems to fly in the face of what the dependency injection thread says, but it still seems the easiest way. I.e. ViewController A picks a photograph and tells a delegate about it. The delegate stores the photo for later and pushes ViewController B to the navigation controller. When a colour is picked, it stores this and pushes ViewController C, passing it the values for colour and photo it stored previously.p  pem2 Pass some kind of properties object between the controllers.em  p  pI could make an object with colour and photo properties and pass it to ViewController A. The photo property would be set in ViewController A and then the object would be passed to ViewController B, which would set the colour property before passing it on to ViewController C for display.p  pBoth options seem kind of ok to me, but neither feel quite right.p  pMaybe Ive totally misunderstood dependency injection, in which case please let me know Otherwise, any thoughts on the above would be tremendous.p  pThank you in advancep
Negative 3890 pThe NSManagedObjectID documentation statesp  blockquote   pAn NSManagedObjectID object is a compact, universal, identifier for a managed object. This forms the basis for uniquing in the Core Data Framework. A managed object ID uniquely identifies the same managed object both between managed object contexts in a single application, and in multiple applications as in distributed systems.p blockquote  pTranslation in my head There is emprobablyem no way that any two NSManagedObjectIDs are ever the same across the set of all instances of my application.p  pThe CFUUID documentation statesp  blockquote   pUUIDs ... are 128bit values   guaranteed to be unique. A UUID is   made unique over both space and time   by combining a value unique to the   computer on which it was   generatedusually the Ethernet   hardware addressand a value   representing the number of   100nanosecond intervals since October   15, 1582 at 000000.p blockquote  pTranslation in my head There is emdefinitelyem no way that any two CFUUIDs are ever the same across the set of all instances of my application.p  pThe fact that NSManagedObjectIDs are described as a universal identifier makes me almost certain that they offer the same uniqueness as a CFUUID, whereas unique across space and time leaves absolutely no room for doubt.

Negative 3890 pI have an application which updates an image from time to time.  The update interval is not predictable.  The image itself is updated atomically on the web server via coderenamecode.  That is all this application does and there shall be no change on the Apache side such that the webserver can continue to only serve static files.p  pThere is some codeAJAXcode script which displays the content and updates this image when it is changed.  This is done using polling.  The naive JavaScript version used a counter and strikeupdatedstrike pulled the image each second or so by adding a query timestamp.  However 99 of the time this pulls the image unchanged.p  pThe current not so naive version uses codeXMLHttpRequestcode aka. codeAJAXcode to check the IfModifiedSinceheader, and if a change is detected the update is invoked.p  pstrongThe question now is, is there a better way to archive this effectstrong  Perhaps look at the last paragraph of this text before you dive into this p  pHere are the core code snippets of the current version.

Sorry, I cannot provide a working example, as my update source is nonpublic. Also please excuse that the code is somewhat quickndirty quality.p  pStrictly speaking HEAD alone is enough, we could look at the LastModified header of course. But this recipe here also works for codeGETcode requests in a nonimage situation.p  pcodeAJAXcode codeGETcode in combination with images makes less  sense, as this pulls the image as binary data. I could convert that into some inline image, of course, but on bigger images like mine this will exceed the maximum URL length.p  pOne thing which possibly can be done is using the browser cache. That is pull the image using an codeajax.updatecode and then redisplay the image from the cache.p  pHowever this depends on the cache strategy of a browser.  On mobile devices the image might be too big to be cached, in that case it is transferred twice.  This is wrong as usually mobile devices have slow and more important expensive data links.p  pWe could use this method if the webserver would write a text file, like JSON or a JS snippet, which then is used to display the image. However the nice thing about this code here is, that you do not need to provide additional information. So no race conditions, no new weird states like in disk full cases, just works.p  pSo one basic idea is to not alter the code on the webserver which generates the picture, just do it on the browser side. This way all you need is a softlink from the web tree to the image and make sure, the image is atomically updated.p  pThe downside of codeAJAXcode is the same origin policy, so codeAJAXcode can only check the codeHEADcode of resources from the host which provided the running codeJavaScriptcode code. Greasemonkey or Scriptlets can circumvent that, but these cannot be deployed to a broad audience. So foreign resources images sadly cannot be efficiently queried if they were updated or not. At my side luclily both, the script and the image, originate from the same host.p  pHaving said this all, stronghere are the problems with this codestrongp  pThe code above adds to the delay.  First the HEAD is checked and if this shows that something has changed the update is done. It would be nice to do both in one request, such that the update of the image does not require an additional roundtrip.p  pcodeGETcode can archive that with IfModifiedSince, and it works on my side, however I found no way to properly display the result as an inlined image.  It might work for some browsers, but not for all.p  pThe code also is way too complex for my taste.  You have to deal with possible network timeouts, not overwhelming limited bandwidth, trying to be friendly to the webserver, being compatible to as many browsers as possible, and so on.p  pAlso I would like to get rid of the hack to use a query parameter just to pull an updated image, as this slowly fillsflushes the cache.p  pPerhaps there is an  unknown to me  way to retrigger image refresh in the browser This way the browser could check with IfModifiedSince directly and update the image. With JavaScript this could trigger a code.loadcode event then or similar. At my side I even do not need that at all, all I want is to keep the image somewhat current.p  pI did not experiment with codeCANVAScode yet.  Perhaps somebody has an idea using that.p  pSo my question just is, is there any better way another algorithm than shown above, except from improving code qualityp

Negative 3890 pI have some huge binary files which Im currently reading using memory mapping on Windows. Everything works fine, but problems start when the file size is larger than memory. For instance, on a 24 GiB memory machine, I map a 64 GiB file and then Im doing more or less streaming reads through it not totally streaming, but okish. Nevertheless, the process winds up using all memory at some point.p  pIm touching each byte in the file exactly once, so it should be enough to keep lets say 45 GiB around for optimal performance. Is there a way to force Windows 7 to discard pages FlushViewOfFile discards emdirtyem pages only, but in my use case, Im only reading from the file. Ive already set the NOBUFFER flag, but Id like to be able to reduce the page priority somehow so they get evicted more quickly. Right now, once the memory is full, the app comes to a grinding halt as Windows pages out everything.p  p[Edit] Its a 64bit application on a 64bit windows.p

Negative 3890 pWhat do you think is a good name for a variable or parameter that represents a list any list For identifiers of some other common types the choice is more obvious, like s for a string and a for an array. The problem with l is that it looks too much like I capital i or 1. The name ls is the best I have found so far but it is not as nice as a oneletter name. I have also seen t being used although I dont associate this letter with a list. How do you name your listsp  pEdit Since some people seem to have misinterpreted the question let me just clarify that I consider lists without any special interpretation, like a list parameter in a list API.p  pEdit II This question is emnotem about Hungarian notation. Its about short one, two or maybe threeletter identifiers occurring in generic contexts.p

Negative 3890 pstrongScenario 1strongbr In my web application say for there is a screen for adding an employee to system. As soon as user tabs after entering name of the employee, it generates the employee code automatically which is the next field based on some logic and already present records in the database.p  pNow I want to expose rest API for this application so that third party devs can build on top of it. So, I will have a resource called as codeEmployeecode which will respond for GET, PUT and DELETE verbs. But when a client needs to autofill the code, which is a GET operation, it will be on what resource Should I make a new resource codeEmployeeCodeForNamecode or I should get it on codeEmployeeNameGenerateCodecode If I go with codeEmployeeNameGenerateCodecode then what about my resource to GET, PUT and DELETE for codeEmployeecode i.e. actually codeEmployeeIdcodep  pstrongScenario 2strongbr Here lets take the case of a stackoverflow post. So lets say the resource would be codePostIdcode. In the same way as in the previous example it lists me possible duplicate question as soon as I tab out of the codeTitlecode field.p  pAgain on what URL I should get those possible duplicatesp  pI cant think of more scenarios just now. But many such kind of scenarios may come up in real life application development. How to implement them in RESTful wayp  pstrongUpdate on scenario 1strongbr Code and Id are two different fields. Id is primary key, code can be duplicate across departments just to illustrate. Also to generate a code, name should be provided first. So, if user types a name FirstName LastName then server might generate codeFL003code as code assuming that there are already two more employees with firstname starting from codeFcode and lastname starting from codeLcode in the said department. Department can be identified based on the logged in user.p

Negative 3890 pFor a project, I was working with a partner writing a decision tree implementation.  Since both of us are relative newcomers to C and had to work quickly, we basically dumped all the functionality in a single file, which ended up being over 1600 lines.

In its current condition, that isnt going to happen.p  pRight now, Im breaking up the original source based on function responsibility.  Thing is, many of the functions are intertwined, and Im getting major errors with my make file.  More specifically, the other source files are reporting implicit declaration of functions that are declared in a separate file.p  pI really have no experience with multiple file makefiles.

Negative 3890 pAny idea what is the best way to store Twitters tweet ID and other Twitter data item IDs in general in a Core Data field This is to locally cache tweets and other Twitter data and will be used as the primary unique ID to link the local data with the one in the server side. That is, any new ID value returned by the API will create a record locally whereas if there is an existing ID in the local data store, the rest of the data will be updated from whatever the Twitter API return. So there will be many fetches done on this field.p  pThis is for the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCoreData relnofollowCore Dataa library for Mac OS X  iOS and the underlying persistent store used is SQLite.p  pAs you might have known, currently a hrefhttpsdev.twitter.comblogdirectmessagesgoingsnowflakeonsep302011 relnofollowTwitter defines message IDs as 64bit unsigned integersa. Based on this, I can think of these options store Twitter IDs locallyp  ol liAs a 64bit signed integer Core Data doesnt have an unsigned integer typeli liAs a Stringli liAs a Decimalli ol  pOption 1 has two dangers that I can foreseep  ul liInteger overflows sign overflow, primarily when parsing the string representation of the ID.li liWhat if Twitter overflows 64 bit and enlarge their range of ID valuesli ul  pOption 2 may be less efficient since this field is frequently used in fetches.p  pOption 3 may not be more efficient than option 2 since a hrefhttpwww.sqlite.orgdatatype3.html relnofollowSQLite 3 does not have a native variablelength number typea.p  pThe ideal option is probably to store it as 128bit unsigned integer, which makes them as unique as UUIDs and wont be as large as strings.

Negative 3890 pRecently Ive been facing few crashes due to class size changes in base class and derived class not being compiled. Let me give you a simple example., I have a base class, BaseClass present in Base.dll and I have inherited that class and created DerivedClass which is present in Derived.dll. Whenever BaseClass size changes Derived.dll should be recompiled. But it might not always be possible to find all dependent binaries and sometimes people miss a few dependent binaries. In those cases we get mysterious crashes that are very hard to debug. Is there any way to narrow down on such problems In other words, what clues would let you think in this directionp  pEDIT 1 More details. Please assume that there is more than one base class say base1, base2, base3 etc., each derived in separate dlls. derived1.dll, derived2.dll and derived3.dll. It is unnecessary to compile all other projects for  a size change in one base class. Also, making dependencies is not an option, which is why we run into this issue often.p

Negative 3890 pIm writing an OCR application to read characters from a screenshot image.  Currently, Im focusing only on digits.  Im partially basing my approach on this blog post a hrefhttpblog.damiles.com200811basicocrinopencvhttpblog.damiles.com200811basicocrinopencva.p  pI can successfully extract each individual character using some clever thresholding.  Where things get a bit tricky is matching the characters.  Even with fixed font face and size, there are some variables such as background color and kerning that cause the same digit to appear in slightly different shapes.  For example, the below image is segmented into 3 partsp  ol liTop a target digit that I successfully extracted from a screenshotli liMiddle the template a digit from my training setli liBottom the error absolute difference between the top and middle imagesli ol  pThe parts have all been scaled the distance between the two green horizontal lines represents one pixel.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFQ41G.png alttopbottommiddlep  pYou can see that despite both the top and middle images clearly representing a 2, the error between them is quite high.  This causes false positives when matching other digits  for example, its not hard to see how a wellplaced 7 can match the target digit in the image above better than the middle image can.p  pCurrently, Im handling this by having a heap of training images for each digit, and matching the target digit against those images, emonebyoneem.  I tried taking the average image of the training set, but that doesnt resolve the problem false positives on other digits.p  pIm a bit reluctant to perform matching using a shifted template itd be essentially the same as what Im doing now.  Is there a better way to compare the two images than simple absolute difference  I was thinking of maybe something like the EMD earth movers distance, a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiEarthmoverhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiEarthmoverasdistance in 2D basically, I need a comparison method that isnt as sensitive to global shifting and small local changes pixels next to a white pixel becoming white, or pixels next to a black pixel becoming black, but is sensitive to global changes black pixels that are nowhere near white pixels become black, and vice versa.p  pCan anybody suggest a more effective matching method than absolute differencep  pIm doing all this in OpenCV using the Cstyle Python wrappers codeimport cvcode.p

Negative 3890 pI have a Rails 3.2 app running on Heroku, and it uses CKEditor. Now, CKEditor is a pretty large collection of files and folders, and is probably the biggest contributor to the time it takes to precompile assets.

Negative 3890 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have a requirement that messages displayed to the user must vary both by language and by company division.  Thus, I cant use out of the box resource bundles, so Im essentially writing my own version of resource bundles using PropertiesConfiguration files.p  pIn addition, I have a requirement that messages must be modifiable dynamically in production wo doing restarts.p  pIm loading up three different iterations of property filesp  precodebasenamedivision.properties basename2CharLanguageCode.properties basename.properties codepre  pThese files exist in the classpath.  This code is going into a tag library to be used by multiple portlets in a Portal.p  pI construct the possible .properties files, and then try to load each of them via the followingp  precodePropertiesConfiguration configurationProperties try      configurationProperties  new PropertiesConfigurationpropertyFileName     configurationProperties.setReloadingStrategynew FileChangedReloadingStrategy  catch ConfigurationException e       This is ok  it just means that the specific configuration file doesnt         exist right now, which will often be true.      returnnull  codepre  pIf it did successfully locate a file, it saves the created PropertiesConfiguration into a hashmap for reuse, and then tries to find the key.  Unlike regular resource bundles, if it doesnt find the key, it then tries to find the more general file to see if the key exists in that file  so that only override exceptions need to be put into languagedivision specific property files.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pIf a file did not exist the first time it was checked, it throws the expected exception.  However, if at a later time a file is then later dropped into the classpath and this code is then rerun, the exception is still thrown.  Restarting the portal obviously clears the problem, but thats not useful to me  I need to be able to allow them to drop new messages in place for languagecompanyDivision overrides wo a restart.  And Im not that interested in creating blank files for all possible divisions, since there are quite a few divisions.p  pIm assuming this is a classLoader issue, in that it determines that the file did not exist in the classpath the first time, and caches that result when trying to reload the same file.  Im not interested in doing anything too fancy w the classLoader.  Id be the only one who would be able to understandmaintain that code.  The specific environment is WebSphere Portal.p  pAny ways around this or am I stuckp

Negative 3890 pI am having real trouble with provisioning and code signing issues. I have migrated to a new computer and have a bunch of Valid signing identity not found messages. In repeated attempts to fix distribution code signing I have managed to lose my developer code signing as well.p  pI am the first to admit that the root problem is my bcomplete and utter failureb to grasp the concepts of code signing, provisioning, and all related subjects. I am asking a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9970910whataregoodresourcesotherthanappletounderstandcertificatescodesignseparate questiona on SO to address this.p  pTHIS question is to ask for concrete steps to wipe my provisioning and code signing mess completely clean.

Negative 3890 pWhen I learned about PyQt, there were three things to make me wonder.

They do not seem to be visible for the Qt introspection system, thoughsupsupli lithird, the signals. in Qt, they are statically generated C code  so how is PyQt so smart to allow us to create them a in Python and b basically, on the fly  li ol  pI think I understand 1  for every class with codevirtualcode methods, SIP generates a subclass that inherits it, holding a reference to the Python object, so that the generated code for every overridden method first checks if a Python method exists , and 3 shouldnt be too hard to understand knowing 2. p  pAs it follows from a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles31330QtInternalsReversing relnofollowthis articlea, to have 2 we have to implement the codeqtmetacallcode method for our Python class and to link it to the Qt metasystem by providing a corresponding QMetaObject for our PyQt class.  p  pIll be grateful for any hints on how its done, either in PyQt or PySide, or on how it was done for PySide earlier with BoostPython. p  pIn particular, I wonder what PyQt4.QtCore.SLOT uses as a signature string for a corresponding Python method.p  pPS.

Negative 3890 pBasically my consumers are producers as well.  We get an initial dataset and it gets sent to the queue.  A consumer takes an item and processes it, from that point theres 3 possibilitiesp  ol liData is good and gets putting a good queue for storageli liData is bad and discarded li liData is not goodyet or badyet so data is broken down into smaller parts and sent back to the queue for further processing.li ol  pMy problem is with step 3, because the queue grows very quickly at first its possible that a piece of data is broken down into a part thats duplicated in the queue and the consumers continue to process it and end up in a infinite loop.  p  pI think the way to prevent against this is to prevent duplicates from going into the queue.  I cant do this on the client side because over the course of an hour I may have many cores dealing with billions of data pointsto have each client scan it before submitting would slow me down too much.  I think this needs to be done on the server side but, like I mentioned, the data is quite large and I dont know how to efficiently ensure no duplicates.p  pI might be asking the impossible but thought Id give it a shot. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  p

Negative 3890 pI have just started doing my master thesis. My assignment is to create a system which optimizes the heating of apartments. The apartments have sensors that are measuring the current temperature.p  pBy using these temperatures and some other measures an optimization is done and a signal is sent back to the apartments regulating the temperature. The optimization is to be done 247 in a circular manner looping through all the apartments.p  pThe system therefore must communicate with the sensors, do an optimization and also log the data. Furthermore, a webb based user interfaces should be provided to the apartments so that they can see the current powerwater consumtion.p  pThe system will be written in C.Net.p  pI do not have must experience in building largescale systems and have only limited experience with .Net. My initial thoughts about this is to have a Ntier architecture where, at the highest level two interfaces are provided. One web interface for the user and then some sort of interface for the sensors which have the optimization algorithm below in the architecture. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxGZ4u.jpg altPreliminary architecturep  pI would like to reuse as much of the components further down in the architecture as possible but with the limitation that I would like to seperate the optimization algorithm as much as possible from the rest. That is, a crasch in the algorithm should not affect the rest of the system except perhaps the sensor interface.p  pSo, my question is. In what way should I implement the optimization part Should I create a windows service or should I let it run in an own threadp  pIf a windows service is a good choice, is it possible to use the components further down in the hierachy That is, the database repository, all the objects etc.p  pIs the choice of architecture good. If not, whyp  pIs it something special I should think about when designingimplementing the systemp  pNote.

This, however, still did not work for me. I began looking deeper into the source code of the TypeRepresentationStrategyFactory class. I found out, that Strategy is a private enumeration. This is the second constructor arg I tried to provide. In my project it did never detect it as of type Strategy.p  pFirst I was a little sceptic, because Strategy is private. I mean, I couldnt even instanciate a TypeRepresentationStrategyFactory in Code, because it would not find the type Strategy. I soon found out, that Spring supposedly can do things like that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7254496javaspringbeanwithprivateconstructorBeans with private constructora.p  pIn the end I had to adjust Michaels solution, as it was not identifying the constructor argument whatsoever. No matter what I did. Maybe its my setup, I really dont know.

Negative 3890 pIm from Taiwan and my English is pretty basic, thanks for your forgiveness.p  pI built a iPad app and published to App Store, which is a kind of communicating board AAC for the person who has difficult on speaking. It has several buttons on main view and when user touch up one, the app will play a mp3 sound corresponding to that button. Ive put all mp3 files on a folder and determining which one to play dynamically at runtime. p  pRecently Im working on build the Android version of this app, but I meet a problem that is when I touch up one button on the view, the MediaPlayer play not only the corresponding one but keep playing all the rest mp3 files on the folder continuously. It doesnt happen on the development of iPad version. Any one can help me to resolve this problem and set the MediaPlayer up to working appropriately p  pPS. I put all MP3 files on some subfolders and put them on the assets folder. It because for some reasons, all mp3 files are using numeric file name ex. 0123223.mp3, and which MP3 to play is according to which button user touched up, so I cant use R.raw.0123223 not only because  the R class cant has a member named in numeric, but also the target mp3 file can only determining at runtime instead of compiletime, so I cant use the resraw folder.p  pMy code is as followingp  precodeprivate void PlayMP3String mp3File throws IOException      AssetFileDescriptor afd  this.getAssets.openFdmp3File     MediaPlayer player  new MediaPlayer     player.setOnCompletionListenernew OnCompletionListener         public void onCompletionMediaPlayer mp          System.out.printlnmp.getAudioSessionId   finished.                              player.setDataSourceafd.getFileDescriptor     player.setLoopingfalse     player.prepare     player.start  codepre  pthe parameter mp3file of PlayMP3 is a concatenated string of mp3 file path, according to the button user touched up.p  pMany thanks p

Negative 3890 pI have a local sqlite server. The SQL database only contains a table called codeflightscode. This table codeflightscode only contains two columns codedtcode and codeflightcode. It is created like so codeCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS flight dt INT NOT NULL, flight INT PRIMARY KEYcode. codedtcode is meant to stand for datetime. This column codedtcode holds time and date stamps for each flight. The codeflightcode column is meant to be an auto increment id for each flight.p  pI now need to create the flight and record the ID. But I think my method below is incredibly stupid. There has to be a better way than this. The code below does not work thus adding to the stupidity of my attempt. It returns currently prints codeNone,code.p  pFor added clarification, all I need to do is add a flight with the provided time stamp. Then find the id of the flight I just created. Should be simple enough.p  precodet  inttime.time, conn, c  AT.startSQLdb c.executeINSERT INTO flight VALUES ,NULL,t c.executeSELECT flight FROM flight WHERE dt,t print c.fetchone conn.commit codepre  pBy the way, codeAT.startSQLdbcode is just a method that returns a tuple codesql connection, sql cursorcode.

Negative 3890 pLets say you had a page that utilized plenty of CSS to active the desired affect, however, that couldnt be done with secondary display traits like margin, padding, or border. For instance you needed to create a div tag whos only purpose was of being a certain size, in a certain place, and a certain color it needs to be codedisplayblockcode, and all those properties that can be pinned on divs due to their near universal use. The problem is, its a waist to create all those codeltdivgtltdivgtcode pairs if you dont need them. strongIs there an alternative lone tag that can do those jobs that we usually delegate to divs and simply leave emptystrong It would ultimately behave the same, stylistically, and look like codelttaggtcode. Is there something like that and would it be proper markup Would be great if it was HTML 4 compatable too.p

Negative 3890 pUsing the WCF REST template 4, among cutting down on the amount of configuration needed, you no longer require an SVC file to host a REST Web Service.p  pPreviously I could use an aspScriptManager to create a JavaScript proxy that i could use to call my WCF Web Services using AJAX, I only had to provide the path to my SVC file.p  pNow that there is no SVC file and the service factory is instantiated in the global.asax file, I am not sure how to call my operation contracts via JavaScript.p  pIs there a way round this, or a best practice regarding doing this with WCF 4 Am I better using the old 3.5 model of svc files etcp  pEDIT  Or is my best option to use jQuery Ajax callsp  pThank you to anyone for your time.p

Negative 3890 pIm trying to write a thin wrapper around some C classes to call them from Python. The specific problem is that if codevirtualcode is uncommented below then attempting to create a codeFoocode crashes the interpreter. Im not interested in rewriting this code as Boostpython, SWIG or Pyxxx to solve this problem  this is an extract from a much larger system I would like to know why it happens, although if either of those libraries solves this problem I would love to know how they implement it. If I setup an extension module and register types in the system then the calls from the Python interpreter work without any problems, either using codeextern Ccode or just having static members in a class to register in the slots for the Python type.p  pIf I declare a member to be virtual, then attempting to call it within a call from the Python interpreter causes a crash with bad memory access. The address accessed is the offset that I get if I print out the class member as a pointer. I have specific code to follow, but the basic question is does something in the C runtime environment called by Python screw up the despatch of virtual class member functions Python is v2.6.7 and the C extension is being compiled by GCC 4.2.1.

Negative 3890 pIm trying to find the best way to use Lions autolayout to make this simple window containing a scrollable view with a centered image and a border around it. See my awesome ascii artp  precode                   XXXXXX        XXXXXX        XXXXXX                    codepre  pThe NSScrollViews document view is a flipped NSView subclass that draws a background pattern, and inside that I add an image that the user chooses ie. indeterminate size. When adding the image view, I give it constraints to center it in the document view. The document view itself is given constraints saying it wants to be slightly larger than the loaded image. What Im wanting is the obvious behavior on loading an image larger than the scollview, the scrollers become active, on resizing the window the scrollers activate  deactivate normally.p  pHowever, when loading a large image Im seeing is the document view expanding all right, but the scroll view amp window expand with it After that point the window doesnt permitting resizing any smaller. Obviously Im not doing it right, but I cant see why.p  pI tried changing the priority of the constraints of the document view, anything above NSLayoutPriorityWindowSizeStayPut and the window expands as above makes sense I guess, but anything lower and the document view never resizes, resizing the window smaller works but the scrollers arent enabled.p  pDoes anyone know if there are other priorities I need to set elsewhere, or additional constraints I need, or a different approach altogether .. should I instead be setting the document views intrinsic size Also pointers to any autolayout open source  sample code I havent seen yet would be cool.p

Negative 3890 pA few months ago we switched from Subversion to Git mainly because Git is faster, more convenient for branching and generaly less pain. Only after some time we realized that Git is very illsuited to projects with big binary files. As an example, Git hosting sites like GitHub or Bitbucket dont like to support repo size much over 1 GB, because such repos swallow emalotem of system resources on the server. Even on our desktop machines some repos with big binary artworks like 100MB Photoshop files take a lot of memory and CPU power. It seems like the consensus is that these big binary files dont belong to the code repository, at least as far as Git goes.p  pAre there distributed version control systems that would handle big binaries just fine, with no extra memory or CPU requirements Im talking about file sizes in hundreds of MBs and repo sizes anywhere from 1GB to 10GBs.p

However, mutagen requires a file as an input while I wish to input an mp3 frame or a series of such frames.p  precodedef onreadframesself, data   logging.inforead from inputns, data   binaryaudio  base64.b64decodedata    need to find out how many miliseconds went by here codepre  pUPDATE This is part of a near realtime streaming architecture so the mp3 is encoded in small chunks, so my current solution is to use constant bit rate which allows simple calculation, I realized that there is almost no benefit to using variable bit rate here.p

Queries against the EF ObjectContext are always executed against the databasepli lipBecause the mapping between your objects and your database is specified declaratively instead of in code, if you need to change your database schema, you can minimize the impact on the code you have to modify in your applicationsso the system provides a level of abstraction which helps isolate the app from the database. The EF can therefore replace a large chunk of code you would otherwise have to write and maintain yourself.What if stored procedure design has been changedpli lipThe EF was specifically structured to separate the process of mapping queriesshaping results from building objects and tracking changes.    pli lipDataSets suck, especially in a WCF scenario they add a lot of overhead for handling inmemory data manipulation  means EF with WCF is better in performance pli ol

If I now attempt to scroll to the nextprevious horizontal page, I find myself between the previous page and the current page, or the next page and the page after.p  pIt appears as though dismissing a modal view called by a button on page 24 in the scrollView, gives the scrollView an offset on the xaxis.p  pThe code I use to dismiss the modal views isp  precode IBActionDismissViewidsender      [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedYES]  codepre  pAnd to open a view modaly, I simply dragged a connection from the button to the certain viewcontroller.p  pThe code that creates the pages in the scrollview isp  precode voidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated     scrollView.delegate  self     scrollView.pagingEnabledYES      NSArray frames  [NSArray arrayWithObjects[UIColor redColor], [UIColor greenColor], [UIColor blueColor], [UIColor whiteColor], nil]     for int i  0 i lt frames.count i          CGRect frame         frame.origin.x  self.scrollView.frame.size.width  i         frame.origin.y  0         frame.size  self.scrollView.frame.size          UIView subview  [[UIView alloc] initWithFrameframe]          subview.userInteractionEnabled  NO          [self.scrollView addSubviewsubview]         NSLog Looped, i  i object  , i, [frames objectAtIndexi]           self.scrollView.contentSize  CGSizeMakescrollView.frame.size.width  frames.count, scrollView.frame.size.height 0     NSLogBredde f, self.scrollView.frame.size.width  codepre  pAnd the pagechanger looks like thisp  precode voidscrollViewDidScrollUIScrollView  sender     CGFloat pageWidth  self.scrollView.frame.size.width     int page  floorself.scrollView.contentOffset.x  pageWidth 2 pageWidth 1     self.pageControl.currentPage  page    IBActionchangePage     CGRect frame     frame.origin.x  self.scrollView.frame.size.width  self.pageControl.currentPage     frame.origin.y  0     frame.size  self.scrollView.frame.size     [self.scrollView scrollRectToVisibleframe animatedYES]     NSLog Change page  codepre  pAny help is very appreciated  thanks in advance p

Negative 3890 pSorry if this has been asked elsewhere, but I cant find the answer.p  pI recently made a site for which Ive made significant use of session variables for the first time. Ive never bothered to adjust the PHP session configuration before because it hasnt been necessary, session variables have worked as desired. For this site, I wanted to control the lifetime of sessions, so I needed to adjust codegcmaxlifetimecode. As there seems to be no 0 or off setting, I have set it to 31536000 365 days with the intention of controlling expiry using PHP script.p  pIm setting codegcmaxlifetimecode via a local php.ini file, which my host allows. Im also setting codesavepathcode via this file as codegcmaxlifetimecode doesnt seem to work if its not set. I presume this is because when codesavepathcode has no value a default codetmpcode folder for all users this a shared server is used and therefore you shouldnt be able to adjust the lifetime for all users.p  pAnd this all seemed to be working fine. I had two save locations, one for the main site and one for the CMS, at codeabsolutehostingpathtmpsessioncode and codeabsolutehostingpathtmpsessionadmincode, phpinfo showed the correct values, and looking in the relevant folders I could see a bunch of session files. However, after a week or two I dont exactly how long the session functionality of my site stopped working altogether. New sessions were not being created at all. To fix it I have resorted to removing the codesavepathcode from my php.ini file, but now my sessions only last the default 24 minutes.p  pMy initial thoughts were that there might be some file or folder size restrictions within the codetmpcode folder, but I wouldnt have a clue how to change that presumably it would be an Apache thing that Id need my hosting company to change, and it doesnt make much sense anyway, the files are small 1997 files, 17KB for the main site, 41 files, 9KB for the CMS, and the CMS carried on working for a week or so after the main site, before failing in the same way.p  pDoes anyone have any idea what the cause of this might bep

Negative 3890 pIm not sure if this is a knockout issue, a JSON issue or some other issue so Ill just explain it all. p  pI have a Web grid displaying a number of users. I can edit these members using a AJAX popup window. As part of this window I can assign roles to a particular user. As seen in the following imagep  pa hrefhttpimgur.comh9BhGp6 relnofollowimg srchttpi.imgur.comh9BhGp6.png alt titleHosted by imgur.com ap  pThese roles are chosen from dropdown menus and if I want to apply multiple roles to a user I can add extra dropdowns. I do this using knockouts foreach binding. p  pNow after I hit save the webgrid columns update automatically in ALL browsers. However if I edit a user and give them extra roles, then hit save and then try and edit them again their newly added roles are not showing up in IE.

FROM users u INNER JOIN orders o ON o.assignedu.id AND o.status1 codepre  pSo in layman term, basically a customer can have multiple service orders. Every service being independent from one another, I want to select the customers who are COMPLETELY deactivated. For examplep  pSusan has 2 service orders, 1 which is activated and the other deactivated. Right now, Susan is being populated in the list of users who are deactivated and that is incorrect. Only the customers whose orders are completely deactivated.p  pThank youp

Negative 3890 pIm trying to perform statistical analysis on relatively flat time series data with AWS Elastic MapReduce. AWS gives you the option of using Hive, Pig, or HBase for EMR jobs which one would be best for this type of analysis I dont think data analysis is gonna be on the terrabyte scale items in my tables are mostly under 1K. Ive also never used any of the three, but learning curve shouldnt be an issue. Im more concerned with what is going to be more efficient Im also handing this project off soon, so something that is relatively to understand for people with noSQL experience would be nice but Im mostly looking to make the sensible choice for the data I have. An example query I might make is something like Find all accounts between last week and today with an event value over 20 for each day.p

Negative 3890 pI was looking at an example in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTheCProgrammingLanguage relnofollowKampR 2a 8.6 Example  Listing Directories. It is a stripped down version of Linux command codelscode or Windows codedircode. The example shows an implementation of functions like codeopendircode, codereaddircode.  Ive tried and typed the code wordbyword but it still doesnt work. All it does is that it prints the  a dot for the current directory and exits.p  pOne interesting thing I found in the code in the implementation of codereaddircode was that it was calling the system calls like codeopencode and codereadcode on directory. Something like p  precodeint fd, n char buf[1000], bufp  bufp  buf fd  opendirname, ORDONLY, 0 n  readfd, bufp, 1000 writefd, bufp, n codepre  pWhen I run this code I get no output even when the folder name codedirnamecode has some files in it.p  pAlso, the book says, that the implementation is for emVersion 7 and System V UNIX systemsem. Is that the reason why it is not working on Linuxp  pHere is the code a hrefhttpideone.comtw8ouX relnofollowhttpideone.comtw8ouXa.p  pSo does Linux not allow codereadcode system calls on directories Or something else is causing thisp

Negative 3890 pI am using Valgrind to debug an OpenCV application. My application often stops with Segmentation Fault error. I thought this is related to memory, so I debug it using Valgrind in Eclipse.

Negative 3890 pI have a web application which currently only supports PostgreSQL as a backend and has its own user management. Connection to the database is done using a generic user account using Postgres auth mechanisms. This application should now get a audit log for some created and changed data hopefully based on triggers and stored procedures only and for performance reasons it would be nice if everything works async and independent from the web application.p  pThere is one main problem We want to know which user of the web application made some changes or created data, but this piece of information is normally not available in stored procedures out of the box because we connect to Postgres using a generic account. What I would like to avoid doing is calling the stored procedures in the web application and provide user ids that way, as this would mean to add the relevant calls in may places in the web application. Besides that we make updates to the data model directly using the database without the web application, meaning we would need the triggers in any case.p  pCurrently the web application is working with a transaction started on every request and committed on its end. Therefore I though of creating a temporary table within the transaction in every request which always gets the current user id of the request which should be available for the stored procedures executed by the triggers on created or changed data.p  pSome things I dont know are if the stored procedures executed can even access the current transaction of the database and therefore are able to retrieve the current user id from the temporary table The table is not part of the changed data the trigger was created for. How would performance be affected if each request creates a temporary table to store just one Integer in the worst case If the trigger is able to access the temporary table, the request may finish at any time because its work is done or of errors. How would that affect a trigger which would have access to the temporary table which only exits within the transaction which gets committed or reverted as the stored procedures want to read the user idp  pIs there any other way with which I can map a user id to some unique identifier of a transaction which the trigger has access to Besides a temporary table, I could create a normal table in which I map user ids to transaction ids on start of every request but independent of the current transaction. If the trigger would now get the transaction id which was responsible for executing the trigger the stored procedures could use the transaction id to look up the user id which used the transaction.p  pAny thoughts Thanksp  pIve added a question about trigger lifetime and execution context which fits to this questionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18038050executioncontextofdatabasetriggerinpostgresqlexecution context of database trigger in PostgreSQLap
Negative 3890 pI have an image of a Pie Chart with 5 equal sections, i would like to create a rollover for each section which would then produce a pop up tooltip which will contain text as well as each section link to another page.p  pI realise this may be fairly involved, so I am also toying with the idea of making each of the 5 sections clickable which would then take the user to a bookmark set on the page. But i am still unser of how to seperate the pie chart so that each section is individually linked.p  pThe pie chart has custom text on each of the sections so Im not able to use and of the generic pie chart solutions i have found. The pie chart is currently made up of one image, i am able to edit the image if required.p  pThanks in advanced for any help.p

Negative 3890 pI am using UIWebView to allow the user to push a new controller which opens up YouTube. What I want to do is pass a string directly into the YT search bar.

Negative 3890 pI have a UI framework for an XNA engine written that currently makes it easy to define user interfaces via code.  I am looking at making it easier to utilize by allowing the defining of user interfaces via XML.p  pWhat Im stuck on is creating the deserialization classes.  The issue is that the root contains a collection of items, and some items may contain one or more child items.  Right now I have something similar top  precode[XmlRoot] public class RootClass      [XmlArray]     [XmlArrayItemClassA, typeofClassA]     [XmlArrayItemClassB, typeofClassB]     public ListltBaseClassgt Classes  get set    public class BaseClass      [XmlAttribute]     public string Name  get set   public class ClassA  BaseClass      [XmlAttribute]     public string AValue  get set      [XmlArray]     [XmlArrayItemClassA, typeofClassA]     [XmlArrayItemClassB, typeofClassB]     public ListltBaseClassgt Children  get set    public class ClassB  BaseClass      [XmlAttribute]     public string BValue  get set      [XmlElementClassA, typeofClassA]     [XmlElementClassB, typeofClassB]     public BaseClass SingleChild  get set   codepre  pThe intention of this is that the root can contain any number of subclasses, but the codeClassAcode elements can contain any number of child classes, while the codeClassBcode type may contain a single child class.p  pThis has a massive maintainability issue because when I add a new class that inherits from codeBaseClasscode such as codeClassCcode, I need to add a new codeXmlArrayItemcode attribute to the codeRootClass.Classescode property emandem to every other list that is used.  If codeClassCcode also contains a list of classes, then that is now 3 points I need to maintain the codeXmlArrayItemcode attribute listings.  I also need to make sure any single class values have a new code[XmlElement]code attribute added to them.p  pIs there an easier way to keep from having to repeat these inheritance mappings across every deserialization classp

Negative 3890 pDESIRED EFFECTp  pImagine a UIScrollView such that as you scroll in any direction, you feel like youre looking around inside a dome. As in, the screen is stretchedwarpeddistorted at the edges by a filtermesh of some sort. Think of a 3D game where youre looking up at the sky.p  pWHAT ITS FORp  pI plan on plastering menu items on a sky of sorts. Imagine looking at the sky where clouds are tappable menu items and there are enough clouds such that you have to scroll around to find them all. This is just a menu to the actual content it isnt a full 3D game where you can move around and such. I am therefore hoping that I can fake the 3D effect by stretchingwarpingdistorting the edges of the screen.p  pWHAT I NEEDp  pI need to at least know the direction to look in so that I can see how feasible and how much work it will take. If its too much, Ill unfortunately have to do something else.p  pFrom what Ive looked at so far, it appears that QuartzCore isnt enough and I suspect that OpenGL is the only way to do it. Before I throw myself into OpenGL though Im a complete noob at it, Id like to know if thats even the correct technology that I should be looking at. And if it is, what area of it I should be looking at initial searches indicated stuff like texture warping might be what Im looking for.p  pThanksp

The user wont see it, or he will see it in a different request.p  pAnd the worst case is when you need to regenerate the session ID. If the update is slow and the next request comes faster than that, the user will get logged out because he will be asking for a nonexistent or expired session he received the new session ID in the cookie as part of the response.p  pSo what I wanna know is whether this has already been studied, whether people are using it, when should I do it, when I shouldnt, if there is a fix for it, etc.p

Negative 3890 pIm working on a JAXRS web application that is reading the complete folder content into a database. The files in that folder can be very big 100Mb. JAXB is used for unmarshalling the xml into Java objects. These objects are persisted into the DB using Hibernate.p  pTo avoid impact on the memory I decided not to keep the content of the complete file in memory, but to process each object individually using streaming.p  pAn additional requirement is that the folder is processed transactionally. So if an error occurs in one of the xmls, the complete folder content is moved to an error folder and the elements that are already added to the database are rollbacked.p  pNow my question is related to the memory management of hibernate. Since the real commit is done at the very end after all the elements are persisted to the database using the entity manager, does hibernate keep the data to be really committed in memory the whole time And if so, do I have any advantage with the streaming of the files in the folder, or is it completely useless since all the elements are kept in memory anyhow by the Spring transactions before committing to the DB p

Before I ran codempicccode from command line I had to run codevcvarsall.batcode first because I got an error that codemspdb110.dllcode was missing.

I hope this is causing all my problems. p  pThere is still one other thing confusing me a little bit, nothing serious but when I uninstalled CB and installed it again, CB had may codenew mpicode compiler setup somewhere saved.

Negative 3890 pI am using a tomcat servlet that concurrently stores content as it becomes available to the servlet. A single request may have 1 or several thousand pieces components that may need to be stored.p  pTo handle the concurrency, I use a fixed size table of thread pointers. As a component becomes available to be stored  the storing object is assigned to a slot in the table and execution begins. As the thread completes, the slot is NULLed and another storing object assigned as needed. If all slots in the table are used, then the table is periodically checked for completed threads and the thread is replaced.p  pManaging memory with this model can be difficult because garbage collection never completely cleans up the memory used by the treads as they die. This can result in memory overflows or memory recovery that is too small.p  pIs there a way to handle GC with this type  e.g. synching becomes required followed by GC Is there a java concurrency handler that matches this type of handling ...p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.p  pThanksp

See a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsazuredd135733.aspx relnofollowthis pagea for details on the BLOB Service rest api.li liWhen i download the file manually through the browser i can see the base64 encoded string which starts witch dataapplicationoctetstreambase64,AAAA.....li ul  pUPLOADCODE snippetp  precode.ajax   url url,   type PUT,   data requestData,   processData false,   beforeSend function xhr                                xhr.setRequestHeaderxmsblobtype, BlockBlob                ,                tryCount 0,                retryLimit NUMBEROFRETRIES,                success successcallback,                error errorcallback     codepre  pAt this point all is well. I am stuck at playback of the file from the storage api. I can access the file through the url but now i want a user to be able to listen to the uploaded audio.p  pIve been thinking along the following solutions which i havent been able to get working yetp  pA.  Use phonegap media class and pass in the url to the base64 encoded string and start playing streaming audio. p  pB. Download base64 string, convert to audio file in javascript and start playback.p  pC. Upload the file in Blob storage as an actual aac file instead of a base64 encoded string so playback starts when opening the url through, for example, the browser.p  pD. ... p  pIn what way can I turn any of these scenarios into a working solutionp

If I have 3 lists with 3 generated buttons, my function generates 3 buttons if I click on a button. I knew the reason for my mistake. Its because I have 3 buttons with the same class, so it triggers the function multiple times. I just cant figure out how I can solve this problem. I tried so many methods to prevent this. For example unbind the function and bind it again. I also tried to dynamically add button with unique functions, but I couldnt get this.  Any Ideas how can I solve this problem easierp

Negative 3890 pI have read about this topic in CLR C but theres something im wondering about.p  pIt is said that an instance of a class only stores its fields, a type object pointer pointing to its type object and its sync block index in the heap. the type object itself also has a type object pointer. so at which object does the type objects type object pointer point to shouldnt be all important data and metadata for the class already be in the type object itselfp  phope you get my point its quite confusing p

The only thing that doesnt work yet that Im trying to do with this code, is confirming the attack by clicking a button. The function codedoCurlcode I made myself has always worked for me putting other forms on tribalwars and other sites. Since Im including every post variable which could possibly be required by means of a codeforeach inputs as inputcode, I really dont understand what could be going wrong there are no codeselectcodes on the page.p  pSo what other possibilities are there for a cURL form submit not to work I think there is no javascript involved. p

Negative 3890 pI am writing a Python app that should run in both Windows and Linux, but am having an issue with one of the filenaming conventions. I need to load a JSON file that has a colon in its name. However, with Windows 7 it doesnt seem to be possible, at least not directly.p  pThese files are stored on a NFS drive thus we are able to see it in Windows 7, but cannot open them.p  pDoes anyone have a workaround as to how it may be possible to read the JSON file containing a colon in Windows 7 using Python One possible workaround we have that wed like to avoid is to SSH into a Linux box, echo the contents and send it back. p  pObviously if anyone else has another method that would be great. Windows XP is able to open them and read them just fine  this is just an issue with Win 7.p  pedit Update We found out that we can access our NFSAFS servers through the web. So we ended up using urllib2 urlopen for all the JSON files that contain invalid characters. Seems to be working well so far.p

If session data is less than this     threshold, then session data is kept only in a secure cookie.  This avoids     memcachedatastore latency which is critical for small sessions.

Negative 3890 pIve build a dropdown menu element directive in Angular. ngClick on the menu button toggles the menu and works seamlessly. However, my codedocument.clickcode binding to close the menu when a click happens outside it takes a few seconds to happen.p  pIve put a breakpoint on the binding and on my codecloseMenucode scope function. Both of those happen immediately, but the class change that results from my ngClass attribute doesnt seem to change the elements class for another second or two.p  pIn a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0BUPCnLhba75S2huNzFiT0ltLW8edituspsharing relnofollowthis videoa, Ive demonstrated the two ways to close the dropdown first, by clicking the dropdown button which fires a function via ngClick to change codemenuActivecode which turns the active class off. Second, by clicking outside the menu which fires codedocumentcodes click event to change the same scope variable as the first method. You can see the delay of about 2 seconds when not closing with the dropdown menu button.p  pHeres my directivep  precodeangular.moduledropdownDirective, []     .directivedropdown, functiondocument          use strict         return              restrict E,             transclude true,             scope                  ngIcon ,                 ngCaret ,                 ngLabel              ,             templateUrl gridsmartwebclientdirectivesdropdowndropdown.html,             link functionscope, element                  var handler  functionevent                      if element[0].containsevent.target                          scope.closeMenu                                                        document.onclick, handler                 scope.ondestroy, function                      document.offclick, handler                                   scope.clicked  false                 scope.positionDropdown  function                      if scope.clicked                          scope.clicked  true                         scope.buttonHeight  element.findbutton[0].offsetHeight  px                                                   ,             controller functionscope                  scope.menuActive  false                 scope.toggleMenu  function                       scope.positionDropdown                     scope.menuActive  scope.menuActive                                  scope.closeMenu  function                      scope.menuActive  false                                             codepre  pAnd heres the dropdowns templatep  precodeltdiv classdropdown ngclassactive menuActivegt     ltbutton ngclicktoggleMenugtngLabellti ngclassngIcon ngifngIcongtltigtltb classcaret ngifngCaretgtltbgtltbuttongt     ltul ngshowmenuActive ngstyletop buttonHeight ngtranscludegt     ltulgt ltdivgt codepre  pngClick for the button simply toggles the value of codemenuActivecode.

Negative 3890 pI wondered if someone could help. We use Google Apps for Education. Within the system we have a shared folder where teachers can place files for students to access. E.g.

We obviously do not want to transfer their entire data to scienceshared using the transfer facility.p  pIdeally, I am looking for some sort of script which can traverse through the shared folder and change the permissions of each file and folder so that scienceshared is the owner and the individual teacher has edit access.p  pIs this possible and if so, can anyone provide some help on howwhere to start...clueless at the moment.p  pThanks in advance.p

I then cogroup the two relations into one, and store it.p  precodeSPLIT A INTO AA IF 0  A, AB IF 0  B CG  COGROUP AA BY 1, AB BY 1  STORE CG INTO cg USING PigStorage codepre  pWhen I do that,  I can see from my local output the following linesp  precodeSuccess Job Stats time in seconds JobId   Alias   Feature Outputs joblocal0001  A,AA,AB,CG  COGROUP testcg,  Inputs Successfully read records from testtest.csv Successfully read records from testtest.csv codepre  pOutputs    Successfully stored records in testcgp  pso it looks like the data is read twice. Indeed, I can see that the number of mappers doubles on a cluster. p  pWhat causes this behaviour Is there a way to avoid it, or does it have a good reason I am missing p

Negative 3890 pWebGL does not work in the following three scenariosp  pfor the test webgl site used get.webgl.orgp  p1  Start chrome, Google search for the test webgl site, click on the link in the search result.p  p2 Go to the test webgl site from a link in an email.p  p3 Start Chrome from a short cut or command prompt, CProgram FilesGoogleChromeApplicationchrome.exe a hrefhttpget.webgl.org relnofollowhttpget.webgl.orgap  pThis only happens when Chrome is not already running.  In other words WebGL does not work when chrome starts up.  However it does work if chrome is already running.p  pThe best demonstration is scenario number 3, above. This starts chrome and goes to a hrefhttpget.webgl.org relnofollowhttpget.webgl.orga and Webgl does not work. Then do exactly the same again but this time with chrome already open and Webgl works.p  pWould very much appreciate feedback or a solution, thanks.p  pHave also created various test sites in html, javascript and webgl, in order to find a workaround. For example if webgl is not available then allow the user to click on a link to open the page in a new tab, this does not work. However if the user opens a new tab then loads the page, webgl is detected and works.p  pIn short, if a customer opens chrome and searches for your website that has webgl content. Then clicks on the link, webgl will not work.  It does not seem reasonable to then instruct the customer to open a new tab and then go to the same website a second time. So far have not been able to find a solution so that it just works without the customer having to fiddle around.p  pI realize that this may be a chrome issue as it does not occur in firefox, however am trying to find a javascript solution rather than waiting for chrome developers to fix it.p  pThanks for any suggestions.p  pWindows XP Pro, Chrome V36p  pHi Mack, p  pThanks for your reply. The majority of visitors to my web site have XP and Chrome.  I should imagine that this is true for quite a lot of peoples, websites.p  pstrongProblem 1strong  The first fallback I had on my website was to detect if webgl is supported. If yes then continue as normal. If no then display a help page. This was simple and worked, however, google crawlers do not handle the javascript very well, therefore always index the webgl help page, rather than the home page.p  pstrongSolution 1strong  Managed to fix this by having a popup box appear when webgl is not supported, giving the user a choice of whether to continue or go to the help page. The conditional code that processes the user response is arranged so that if the user is a google crawler then it simply falls through and displays the html content of the home page, and not the help page.p  pThere are lots of web sites that seem to have this same problem, including get.webgl.org, in other words, if you do a google search for a website, and that site contains webgl detection and fallback code, the search result always shows the fallback content, rather than the authors intended main content.p  pstrongProblem 2strong Now that I finally have the home page listed correctly by google, found that am still losing many customers, as they are starting chrome, searching google for my site suit yourself shirts, clicking the link in the result and being told incorrectly that webgl is not supported.p  pAm very interested in your solution but do not quite understand how it works. Have tried detection then page refresh or load the page in a new tab or display a link for the user to load the page, but none of these methods seem to work. Seems like quite a fundamental problem that would effect many webgl websites. Would be very greatfull if you could explain your suggestion a little further.  Thanks for your help, kind regards  Garyp

Negative 3890 pI have a program written in VB.NET and I wrote it with all my SQL statements hardcoded into the program. I wanted to try to store all my queries externally in an XML file so that changes can be made to the SQL if needed without having the go into the code and rebuild the program every single time.p  pThe part that is complicating things is that the SQL statements require variables to be added to it for it to run properly. p  pFor examplep  blockquote   pSELECT namefirst, namelast, emailid FROM amp eventNamep blockquote  pWith codeeventNamecode being a variable in the program.p  pWhen I set up the XML file, I tried both of the followingp  precode    ltDatagt         ltLoadSavesgt               ltSQLStatementgtlt[CDATA[SELECT namefirst, namelast, emailid FROM ampeventNameamp]]gtltSQLStatementgt         ltLoadSavesgt     ltDatagt codepre  pandp  precode    ltDatagt         ltLoadSavesgt               ltSQLStatementgtlt[CDATA[SELECT namefirst, namelast, emailid FROM amp eventName]]gtltSQLStatementgt         ltLoadSavesgt     ltDatagt codepre  pI needed the CDATA because without it, special characters would sometimes make it act weird. p  pMy problem is that the program doesnt do any substituting of variables because in both methods, the program pulls the entire thing as a string.p  pUsing the first method, I was able to just put some code in that would search for codeampeventNameampcode and replaces it with the variable I need in there. This method worked perfectly but then defeats the purpose of having the SQL externally for easy modification, because if all of a sudden I need codeattendeeNamecode instead of codeeventNamecode, then I can change it in the XML file but then I would still need to change the code to look for codeampattendeeNameampcode instead and substitute accordingly.p  pIs there any way I can handle this in a more dynamic way instead of having everything hard coded. Like I said, I want to be able to have my SQL in a separate file for easy modification if needed without having to touch the code, but with keeping in mind that each of my SQL statements require variables to be added to them before they can run.p

Negative 3890 pWe have implemented a video client where it captures N number of pictures from web cam, encodes them and packs them as a block. This block is delivered to the decoder, which then initializes a new IContainer object each time with a buffer containing this received block.p  pAlthough this design works well, by its design it introduces a time delay in the stream delivery. Since we are capturing N frames to build a block for delivery, the delay is N times the frame rate. Also we are not sure what is the cost time of creating and initializing IContainer object each time.p  pTo improve on this, we thinking of sending framebyframe encoded data to the receiver. However, creating new IContainer object in this case wont work since it can not openinitialize with a P or B frame  It always requires an Iframe to initialize else open fails.p  pNow my question is, how do we use the IContainer APIs for such a requirement We do not want to initializeopen the IContainer object each time. We want to know if it is possible to reuse the same IContainer object while we keep feeding it the received frames one by one in sequence. This way we completely avoid the source buffering as well as receiver buffering we however will require a dejitter buffer.p  pWe are using this APIs. a hrefhttpwww.xuggle.compublicdocumentationjavaapicomxugglexugglerIContainer.html relnofollowhttpwww.xuggle.compublicdocumentationjavaapicomxugglexugglerIContainer.htmlap  panil.p

Negative 3890 pI have come across something strange when writing unittests where I want to test that object can really be garbage collected cause all events are clean up properly.p  pTo have a minimal example I created a console project in visualstudio 2013 Target Framework 4.5.1 with the following codep  precodeusing System  namespace GarbageCollectionFinalizerForLoop      class TestObj              TestObj                      Program.DestructorWasCalled  true                    class Program              public static bool DestructorWasCalled  false          static void Mainstring[] args                      object myTestObj  new TestObj              myTestObj  new object              GC.Collect             GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers             GC.WaitForFullGCComplete             GC.Collect              for int i  0 i lt 1 i                                         Console.WriteLineFinalizer was called   DestructorWasCalled             Console.ReadLine                  codepre  pIt turns that the finalizer of the TestObj is not called when there is this useless forloop. When the forloop is commented out the destructor is called. So the forloop seems to prevent that the garbage collector can collect this instance of TestObj. Multiple test yield the same result and this behavior seem 100 deterministic.p  pThen I switched the Target Framework to 3.5 and all of a sudden it worked as expected the destructor function got called. Then I changed the Target Framework back to 4.5.1 and it still worked.p  pI was puzzled and tried project cleanrebuilddeleting file but I could not get back the old behavior. But when I created again a new project with the identical code I get back the buggy behavior... So it seems that switching to Target Framework 3.5 made the code run as expected even if you later switch back to 4.5.1. This is really strange to me.p  pI tried some more things in parentheses the console outputp  pcreate project with 4.5.1 FALSE, switch to 4.5 FALSE, switch to 4.5.1 FALSEp  pcreate project with 4.5.1 FALSE, switch to 4 TRUE, switch to 4.5.1 TRUEp  pcreate project with 4.5.1 FALSE, switch to 3.5 TRUE, switch to 4.5.1 TRUEp  pcreate project with 4.5.1 FALSE, switch to 3 TRUE, switch to 4.5.1 TRUEp  pcreate project with 4.5.1 FALSE, switch to 2 TRUE, switch to 4.5.1 TRUEp  pSomething strange is happening here. Does anybody have more information on this issuep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe behavior was the same for DEBUG and RELEASE builds and the problem only affects DEBUG build and RELEASE builds run from withing visualstudio.p

I am asking these questins to be sure Ive understood things right since I am preparing for a presentation.p  pWhen I open an exefile on my computer it is handled by the CLR to get compiled. A JITCompiler exectutes MSIL code JustInTime so that only the needed parts are compiled at runtime. Now this compiled pieces will be stored in memory for later access. p  pFirst question  p  blockquote   pWhat part does the installation process e.g. through an install   wizzard play here Or is istallation just needed in directly compiled   scenarios where the compiler first has to go through all of the code   before runtime That means that installing the program is basicaly   compiling it on a production machine, rightp blockquote  pSecond question  p  blockquote   pIs the JITcompiled code stored in harddrive so that compiled code   never is compiled again or is this compilation process done everytime   I click on an exefilep blockquote  pThanks for helping out.p

Data from the task is output into another csv file, and i would like to have a column of 0s, 1s, and 2s next to the column of new numerical values so that I can parse them for analysis.p  pfor example      each value to come out of strongnewprobValues1  np.arangelow1p, high1p, step  SVstrong should have a second value of 1 associated it, so that I can output those values to a separate column in a csv file.p  pcodep  precodenewprobValues  .17[],          .28[],          .54[],          .84[],          .96[],          .99[],  for npv in newprobValues      mu  probs.ix[probs[DDPD]npv,[Value]]     SV  hyperlaw1npvnpv, kprob yields subjective value of one dollar at given delay     mu  floatmu[Value]     generatingvaluesprob[npv]  mumu, SVSV     if mu gt 25.50         set desired ran         low1p, high1p  floatmu4SV, floatmu.01  .01 is hack to prevent arange from      rounding uneven ceil up to a fifth iteration         low2p, high2p  floatmuSV, floatmu5SV.01          low3p, high3p  20.5, 80         newprobValues1  np.arangelow1p, high1p, step  SV generate hard values below indiff point         newprobValues2  np.arangelow2p, high2p, step  SV generate hard values above indiff point         newprobValues3  np.arangelow3p, high3p, step  6.612         newprobValues[npv]  np.concatenate[newprobValues1, newprobValues2, newprobValues3]         newprobValues[npv]  np.insertnewprobValues[npv], 0, mu         newprobValues[npv]  newprobValues[npv].tolist codepre  pI have tried the codep  precode    newprobValues1  value np.arangelow1p, high1p, step  SV, type 0 codepre  pbut I get a dictionary with 0 in it, when I really need 0 to be assigned to each number  so that when I concatenate shuffle the arrays I can still identify the codearangecode function that generated each valuep

Negative 3890 pI have a fairly simple CRUD model for my REST.

Here are the CRUD endpointsp  precodeGET companies  list all companies GET companies25  GET company with ID 25 GET departments   list all departments GET departments65  GET department with ID 65 codepre  pBefore, the client would codeGET companies25code which returnsp  precodeid25,namemy firm,departments[65,72,10] codepre  pit would then do separate calls for the departments. yes, I could use hyperlinks in the response, but this is a simple examplep  pNow I want to create an aggregation endpoint, so it is a single call. codeGET companies25code will returnp  precodeid25,namemy firm,departments[    id65, nameMarketing,    id72, nameSales,    id10, nameRampD, ] codepre  pthe real situation is much more complexp  pThe problem is that this becomes a single coderesourcecode. If I want to codePUTcode or codePATCHcode whatever has changed, it might send lots of information, since codengresourcecode does not understand that just the codeidcode and codenamecode are part of the department code25code and should be sent, while the rest were provided as a convenience.p  pHow do I use codePATCHcodecodePUTcode with codengresourcecode when the endpoint is aggregatedp  pConversely, if I have a separate endpoint URL for the aggregation, e.g. p  precodeGET fullcompanies25 codepre  pThen it gets even more difficult, because codengresourcecode does not understand one URL for query codeGETcode and another for command codePUTcodecodePATCHcodecodeDELETEcodep

Negative 3890 pI have a similar Problem like here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22247139icloudwithcoredataandfilesync28061641noredirect1comment4450501428061641iCloud with Core Data and File syncap  pIn my App the user can store notes with several stuff like title, text, images and some more per note. My App is Core Data based but for images I store only the URL of the images in Core Data which are saved in the documents directory.p  pEverything is fine but now I want to add iCloud Sync. I wanted this from day one, but iCloud iswas so buggy that I could just not get this to work. Now I found that great framework Ensembles by Drew McCormack. I just started to implement it, but from what I can tell it is just great, doing exactly what I wanted and seems to be really solid.p  pSo everything syncs fine except the images because they are not saved in Core Data directly. I read this thread here and did google a lot, but it seems to me that the best solution is to just store everything in Core Data, this way everything is syncing fine. If I had the chance I would just do this, but my App is already live with using the other solution and saving only the URL of the images in Core Data and saving the actual image in Documents Directory.p  pSomeone said that you could use the syncing side by side using NSFileManager or iCloud Access. But isnt this just a bad solution I mean I could upload an image to iCloud when the user saves it, but I dont know how to proper handle all that other stuff. When launching the App, check for new Images  but how check for which I just need the new ones, and all the merging and so on seems to be very complicatedp  pSo saving the images directly to Core Data would make everything much easier right Or is there another way to sync and merge all the images in the document directory the way that is working like the sync works with Core Data with Ensembles p  pMy guess is it would be better and much easier and less buggy to just save everything in Core Data and let Ensembles do the syncing.. p  pBut as I already released my App with people having images in Document Directory, is there a way I could merge all the images from the documents directory to Core Data once Like prompting the user in the Update to do such a merge once when he enables iCloud p  pTanks for help p  pAnd thanks to Drew McCormack  Ensembles is just great, my sunshine in the dark of frustrating days and nights and weeks and month trying to get iCloud Sync to work properly p

Negative 3890 pI have seen some really old posts that somehow address my question but they werent answered.p  pI usually update mysql tables regardless of a columns change. However, in this new project am starting to work on, I am concerned about that practice. The update is per single row mostly but updates do happen very often.p  pWhat would be the proper way to handle the case Have hidden fields per columns then compare with php or Javascript Can MySQL be smarted to doing something like this Which costs more writing to mysql table even when a column needs no update or to check with php for every updatep  pAny insight is appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 3890 pI have two collections, malls and shops. I want to keep location information of them as latitude and longitude. For malls, it is easy, because they have only one location information, so i can define latitude and longitude property. But for shops, they can be either inside a mall or on the street, and they have multiple locations. I want to keep relation between shops and malls, for the places where they are inside a mall. I want to keep locations as a separate collection at least for the shops, otherwise the data will be very heavy when i list the shops. Locations of a selected shop would be shown downloaded only when necessary. So question is, how should be the data model for locations collection Im considering something like this, but I dont feel it is the best idea.

Negative 3890 h1Backgroundh1  pIm working on a project which is written in C and ASP.Net. Its webbased and the sole purpose of the project is pretty much to generate reports.p  pThere are about 350 reports which you can navigate to through a report tree that which is like a folder tree on a typical windows machine. p  pEach of these reports has pretty much the same structure where when you visit the report page youre provided a navigation style bar at the top which presents a myriad of different dropdowns. When you drill down through the drop down the user may or may not be presented with another dropdown to further specify the report they want. Once the dropdowns have all be selected the user clicks Generate Report. A loading screen shows for a few seconds to low minutes while the report is generated and then the report is loaded.p  h1What Im Afterh1  pWhat Id like to know is if there is some kind of framework that exists for testing a situation similar to this.

Negative 3890 pIm a strongWeb DeveloperPHP Developerstrong by profession. So, Im asking this question from web developers point of view and expecting the answer with the same perspective.p  pThere is one running social website developed in PHPfoxa social networking platform created in phpp  pNow Ive received a requirement from the client to develop Android and iOS apps just like Facebook mobile app based on this website means the app should also resemble the websites functionality. So, in turn these projected apps will be going to access the same MySQL database which the website is currently using. The main objective is the website and these apps should work in sync just like Facebook website and Facebook mobile app. p  pSo, my question is what should be the stepbystep, right, the best and optimum approach in this kind of scenariop  pOn website they have used MVC pattern of development and they have used Twig as a template engine to display the webpages which should not be the case in mobile apps.p  pThe mobile teamsiOS and Android teams are working on the UI design of the app. But what should be my role Im not clear about it. Please explain me the correct stepbystep approach from web developers perspective.p  pThanks.  p

For examplep  precodepublic class SomeValidator extends ValidatorSupport      private boolean alreadyHasErrorOnPage   codepre  pIf the validators are signlestons, using alreadyHasErrorOnPage since it would result in a race condition and never a consistent default state for each requestresponse. If they arent singletons and a new SomeValidator instance is created for each requestresponse then using alreadyHasErrorOnPage would be safe.p  pTake the following with a grain of salt because Im not sure how much of it is specifically related to the project Im currently working on.p  pValidators are singles on our project. I went in and debugged the application and found instance members to not be at a default state after a second requestresponse. Essentially they carry over the value from the first or previous requestresponse.p  pThe reason Im still not sure is because our project seems to have wrapped and ValidatorSuppport and exposed an interface that our validators implement. Within our codebase there seems to be code that stores an instance of the validators in a map essentially making them singletons. I havent been able to determine if stock struts2 behaves in the same manner.p

Negative 3890 pIve been working on an ecommerce project built on Symfony2 for the backend and AngularJS for the frontend. Currently the Symfony part is used only as an API, which has three different user levels guest, customer amp admin. Different actions that can be done within the system like addremove data are secured byp  p1 Symfony2 firewall with user rolesaccess control br  2 JMS security extra PreAuthorize expressionsp  pFor the parts that are secure everything works as intended and Im very happy with the way things work.p  pstrongProblemstrong p  pThere are parts of the API which are public like retrieving product information, categories, etc.. Im retrieving such data in Angular with Ajax calls to my API that returns the data in JSON format. One example would be p  blockquote   papiproductgetallpage1ampcount10ampsorting[id]ascp blockquote  pThe problem is that anyone could look at the requests in browser and copy the path and have access to all the data such as all the products and could just download a JSON of all the information. Although this data is public, I dont want to give others such an easy way of stealing my data.p  pstrongIdeas amp possible solutionsstrongp  p1 I was looking at the JWT Json Web Token standard to try and secure the public calls to my API and implement it in such a way that I generate a token for real users that are on the website, and such limit direct access to public API links. p  pWhat do you think Would this be a possible solutionp  p2 I was also reading in some other question on StackOverflow that I could check the HTTPXREQUESTEDWITH header from the request, but we all know this can be easily spoofed by an attacker. p  p3 Finally, I read a similar approach to solution 1 here  a hrefhttpengineering.talis.comarticleselegantapiauthangularjs relnofollowhttpengineering.talis.comarticleselegantapiauthangularjsa but Im not entirely sure that this fits my purpose. p  pAdditional notes p  ul liI dont want to make this bulletproof, but I also dont want to give people the option to click 2 buttons and get all my data. I know that eventually all the information can be stolen e.g. by using a web scrapper, but securing the system in such a way that people would have to make a bit of an effort is what I have in mind.li liI cant really remodel my API too much at this stage, but any ideas would be appreciatedli ul  pThanks for taking the time to read my question and Im looking forward for any feedback.p

In this case playlist, which holds the state and id information.p  pafter that Ill try to change the state on click using an action in the controller to call a service to do so in the backend and update the modified data on the controller and the scope.p  pthe idea is that the two way data binding will work and the view changes when the data is modified, therefore the directive because I dont want to reload the page.p  pso, since nothing reaches the directive template, what might I been doing wrongp  pmeanwhile I got some kind of solution, which works, but doesnt feel right.p  pgot this in the viewp  precode ltdiv classdatatablecontainergt  lttable ngtabletableParams classtable datatable datatablehasprimary datatablehassecondary ngtableresponsivegt     lttbodygt          lttr ngrepeatplaylist in data  filter vm.search classdatatableselectablerowgt              lttd datatitleIDgtplaylist.idlttdgt              lttd datatitleNamegtplaylist.namelttdgt              lttd datatitleStategt                 lttogglestate xplayliststateplaylist.state xplaylistidplaylist.idgtlttogglestategt             lttdgt              lttd datatitleActionsgt                 lta uisrefweb.playlist.update id playlist.id  classngbinding btn btns btnblue btnfabgtlti classmdi mdipencilgtltigtltagt             lttdgt          lttrgt     lttbodygt lttablegt  ltdivgt codepre  pbasically changed the parameters to be compatible with HTML5 standards. then on the directive, modified it to thisp  precode function  use strict      angular         .moduleapp.playlist         .directivetoggleState, toggleState      function toggleState           var directive               restrict EA,             link dommaniputalions,             replace true,             transclude false,             controller Playlist,             controllerAs vm,             bindToController true,  because the scope is isolated             scope  playlistId, playlistState ,             templateUrl appplaylistplaylisttogglestate.html                   return directive           if you want to do it, this is the place.         function dommaniputalionsscope, el, attr, ctrl                        var currentid  scope.playlistId                 , currentstate  scope.playlistState                               el.bindclick, function                               ctrl.toggleState id currentid                      .thenfunction scope.playlistState  ctrl.playlist.state                                codepre  pand the directive template as followsp  precode ltdivgt lta href            classngbinding btn btns btnblue btnfabgt         lti ngifplaylistState  active     classmdi mdicheckgtltigt         lti ngifplaylistState  inactive   classmdi mdiclosegtltigt ltagt  ltdivgt codepre  pnow every time I click on the button in the grid, it will call the method in the controller which calls a service, updates the data with the response and sends it back to the directive link function where she then updates its scope.p  pthis is my interpretation of it, and I might be wrong but, should it be done in a easier way asking because somehow I got the idea that this two way binding was easier and more transparent for the guys on the layer above the services.p  pcan someone point out which mistakes are being done herep

Once these columns change, then I need to break out of the internal loop, and iterate to the next row of the SQL table and then start the internal loop again while the columns remain the same.p  precode JobId          email          FName    LName    apply    1       email1gmail.com     Joe     Smith     1    1       email1gmail.com     Kim    Joseph     1    1       email1gmail.com    Chris     Bell     1    2       email2gmail.com     Ben      Ken      0    2       email2gmail.com     Sam     Socks     1    3       email3gmail.com     Tom     Allen     0 codepre  pGiven the table above, what I want to do is be able to send 1 email to email1gmail.com with Joe, Kim, and Chris name in it. Then iterate down and send a second email to email2gmail.com with Ben and Sams name in the message, and then a third email to email3gmail.com with Toms name in the message body.p  pI have already written the code of how to send emails and such. What I am having trouble with is iterating through the query correctly. So I have echoed the results onto a webpage to help me work through it so im not sending 1000s of emails. Here is my work thus farp  precodewhilerow  mysqlifetcharrayresult     echo Applicants ltbr gt         JobId  row[JobId]     echo row[FName] .   . row[LNname] . ltbr gt     while mysqlifetcharrayresult[JobId]  JobId         echo row[FName] .   . row[LName] . ltbr gt          echo email address  . row[email] . ltbr gtltbr gt  codepre  pThis iterates through and gives me the correct email address only once which is great. However, it gives me the same FName and LName each time it iterates. Which I know why the row array is not iterated to the next row in the query. So that is the piece Im missing how to do.p  pI also think that the number of times it displays names is incorrect...not as important, but if you instantly see why, that would be great help as well.p  pAny help would be appreciated.

Negative 3890 pI am working on an ASP.NET MVC 5 website that has a public marketing website that contains somewhat static pages with information about the company, legal, social, contact us, etc. that a nonlogged in user can access.

Negative 3890 pI have a web api that has some get methods that raise some distributed queries to multiple systems that are quite long running and cpu expensive. So we added an a hrefhttpsgithub.comfilipwAspNetWebApiOutputCache relnofollowoutput cachinga. Works like a charm and after the first query is processed it is quite fast.p  pSo now i have a maybe common problem when the cache is released. Imagine the scenario that the cache is invalidated or expired for some good reasons and not one client at a time call the web api but 100 clients. What currently happens is that 100 clients start to run the long running query and the cpu explodes to 100, the server instances breaks down and does not respond anymore. What i basically want is that only the first requests does the processing and lets all other wait until he finished with the query and added the result to the cache. then all other ones can get the response from the cache.p  pI know there are around 1000 ways to achieve it but i wonder if there is a general pattern or a best practice for this Or do i have to implement locks Or using TPL or what Frankly speaking i have no clue where to startp  pThank you very much in advance.p

Funnily enough, when I scroll to the third of fourth screen, and then back to the first, the text has kept or rather regained its previous size. p  pI tried to use viewWillAppear and viewDidAppeard to change the font size, but you can witness the change of font size, which is ugly and unexpected. p  pI am running on iOS 9.0.1, but this bug has kept me busy starting in iOS 8.0, which was when I started developing the application. p  pHope someone can help me with this. p  pCheersp  p UPDATE  CODE FOR REVIEW  PageViewController p  precode     voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      self.pageController  [[UIPageViewController alloc] initWithTransitionStyleUIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScroll navigationOrientationUIPageViewControllerNavigationOrientationHorizontal optionsnil]      self.pageController.dataSource  self     [[self.pageController view] setFrame[[self view] bounds]]      childViewController  TutorialChildViewController [self viewControllerAtIndex1]     tvController  TutorialViewControllerTextViewController [self viewControllerAtIndex0]      NSArray viewControllers  [NSArray arrayWithObjecttvController]      UIPageControl pageControl  [UIPageControl appearance]     [self.pageController setViewControllersviewControllers directionUIPageViewControllerNavigationDirectionForward animatedYES completionnil]      [self addChildViewControllerself.pageController]     [[self view] addSubview[self.pageController view]]     [self.pageController didMoveToParentViewControllerself]        UIViewController pageViewControllerUIPageViewController pageViewController viewControllerBeforeViewControllerUIViewController viewController       NSInteger index  0      if [viewController isKindOfClass[TutorialChildViewController class]]          index  [TutorialChildViewController viewController indexNumber]           else if [viewController isKindOfClass[TutorialTextViewController class]]          index  [TutorialChildViewController viewController indexNumber]            if index  0                 return nil              index      return [self viewControllerAtIndexindex]        UIViewController pageViewControllerUIPageViewController pageViewController viewControllerAfterViewControllerUIViewController viewController       NSInteger index  0     if [viewController isKindOfClass[TutorialChildViewController class]]          index  [TutorialChildViewController viewController indexNumber]           else if [viewController isKindOfClass[TutorialTextViewController class]]              index  [TutorialTextViewController viewController indexNumber]               index      if index  6           return nil           return [self viewControllerAtIndexindex]             UIViewController viewControllerAtIndexNSUIntegerindex       TutorialImageViewController viewController  [[TutorialImageViewController alloc] initWithNibNameTutorialImageViewController bundlenil]     TutorialTextViewController tvC  [[TutorialTextViewController alloc] initWithNibNameTutorialTextViewController bundlenil]       switchindex           case 0         case 5              tvC.explanatoryText  [[UITextView alloc] init]             [tvC.explanatoryText setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica Neue size17.0]]              tvC.indexNumber  index             return tvC                      break           case 1         case 2         case 3         case 4                  viewController.preview  [[UIImageView alloc] init]                 viewController.explanatoryText  [[UITextView alloc] init]             [viewController.explanatoryText setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica Neue size17.0]]                  viewController.indexNumber  index                 return viewController                              break          default             break       codepre  p CODE  ViewController with the TextView p  precodevoidviewWillAppearBOOLanimated      [explanatoryText setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica Neue size17.0]]      [self.view addSubviewexplanatoryText]     switch indexNumber           case 0              [explanatoryText setText...text that resizes ....]              break                      case 5             [explanatoryText setText ... text that resizes...]              break         default             break        voidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated      NSLogviewDidAppear     [explanatoryText setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica Neue size17.0]]    voidviewDidDisappearBOOLanimated      [explanatoryText setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica Neue size17.0]]    voidviewWillDisappearBOOLanimated      [explanatoryText setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica Neue size17.0]]   codepre  pThe cases 14 use a different ChildViewController TutorialImageViewController, the troublesome textview is explanatoryText. p  pI also tried to use the life cycle methods of the ChildViewController to force the text to stay the same size.p  pHope this helps and clarifies thingsp
Negative 3890 pI have defined a regressor as followsp  precodenn1  Regressor layers[     LayerRectifier, units150,     LayerRectifier, units100,     LayerLinear], regularizeL2,  dropoutrate0.25, learningrate0.01, validsize0.1, learningruleadagrad, verboseFalse, weightdecay0.00030, nstable10, fstable0.00010, niter200 codepre  pI am using this regressor in a kfold crossvalidation. In order for crossvalidation to work properly and not learn from the previous folds, its necessary that the regressor to be reset after each fold.br How can I reset the regressor objectp
