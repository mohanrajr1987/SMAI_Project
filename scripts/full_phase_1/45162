Positive 45162 pI noticed that minmax values that are fed to a custom tickPositioner function are not the same as minmax values of the data set. For example, my max value when chart is downloaded as CSV is 353116.2853, but max value provided to the tickPositioner is 390819.334993875.p  pSimilarly, min value in the dataset is 400944.7087, but tickPositioner receives  438647.758392375.p  pIs this a bugp

Positive 45162 pI working with Database first C MVC, EF6, LINQ and JSon to try and pass data to both Highcharts and Google Maps for some of my reporting.p  pIf I could add an image I would show you the relevant portion of my model, but sadly I need more reputation to do that...p  pThe portion of the Entity Model Im concentrating on right now is based on a central Docket that contains a BuildingCode as part of a onetomany relationship to a building with and address and further relationship to the buildings polygons for mapping. Dockets are also classified by one or more DocketTypes and thus there is a manytomany relationship between Dockets and DocketTypes, which is not directly exposed to through the EF.p  pAs an example a Docket which represents an investigation, could be related to the theft of a mobile phone in building A located on Campus X, not only was the cellphone stolen but the assailant also assaulted the victim in order to steal the mobile phone. So there are 2 DocketTypes here 1. Theft of mobile phone and 2. assault. Note this is fictitious and for illustration purposes only .p  pOne of my fundamental reports requires that I count how many docketTypes affect each building and each campus in a given period. When I display this I also need to show what the DocketTypes are.p  pI have no end of nightmare trying to find a way to get this right, I keep running into circular reference errors and needing to use explicit conversions when trying to model the data with LINQ so that I can pass a single nested object through JSON to the client side where displaying will occur.p  pIn the below code I am told I need an Explicit conversion codeCannot implicitly convert type CampusInvestigator.ViewModels.DocketTypeViewModel to System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerableltCampusInvestigator.ViewModels.DocketTypeViewModelgt.

Positive 45162 pSome clarification first. strongThere are several kinds of animations in high charts.strong I am only interested in the strongbeginning animationstrong that draws a line graph when strongadding a seriesstrong.p  pThat being said, it appears that if a series is in the middle of its beginning animation and is removed, the animation will finish drawing and stay permanently on the chart. A new series that is added will not redraw.p  pIs there a way to remove that specific series beginning animation, or redraw the chart in order to refresh it I assume recreating the entire chart can accomplish this but it will not serve my purposes. I need the first series to remain drawn without triggering the beginning animation for the first, but the second has to have a beginning animation so that it can animate over top of the first.p  pHeres an example of the issue for reproductionp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodefunction   var data1  [null, null, null, null, null, 6, 11, 32, 110, 235, 369, 640,                 1005, 1436, 2063, 3057, 4618, 6444, 9822, 15468, 20434, 24126,                 27387, 29459, 31056, 31982, 32040, 31233, 29224, 27342, 26662,                 26956, 27912, 28999, 28965, 27826, 25579, 25722, 24826, 24605,                 24304, 23464, 23708, 24099, 24357, 24237, 24401, 24344, 23586,                 22380, 21004, 17287, 14747, 13076, 12555, 12144, 11009, 10950,                 10871, 10824, 10577, 10527, 10475, 10421, 10358, 10295, 10104]  var animatedData   color FF00FF, data data1  var animatedData   data data1  var data  [name USA, data data1, animatedData]  function reanimateChart  var chart  container.highcharts chart.series[1].remove chart.addSeriesanimatedData chart.redraw   btn1.clickfunction   reanimateChart       btn2.clickfunction   reanimateChart setTimeoutreanimateChart, 100           container.highcharts         chart              type area         ,         title              text US and USSR nuclear stockpiles         ,         subtitle              text Source lta hrefhttpthebulletin.metapress.comcontentc4120650912x74k7fulltext.pdfgt                  thebulletin.metapress.comltagt         ,         xAxis              allowDecimals false,             labels                  formatter function                       return this.value  clean, unformatted number for year                                       ,         yAxis              title                  text Nuclear weapon states             ,             labels                  formatter function                       return this.value  1000  k                                       ,         tooltip              pointFormat series.name produced ltbgtpoint.y,.0fltbgtltbrgtwarheads in point.x         ,         plotOptions              area                  pointStart 1940,                 marker                      enabled false,                     symbol circle,                     radius 2,                     states                          hover                              enabled true                                                                                     ,         series data      codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery2.1.3jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpcode.highcharts.comhighcharts.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpcode.highcharts.commodulesexporting.jsgtltscriptgt  ltdivgt     ltdiv idcontainer styleminwidth 310px height 400px margin 0 autogtltdivgt     ltdivgtltbutton idbtn1gtreanimateltbuttongtltdivgt     ltdivgtltbutton idbtn2gtbreak animationltbuttongtltdivgt ltdivgtcodepre div div p

Positive 45162 pI have been fiddling with generating charts using PHP and SQL data for some time, and have finally found something that I think will work for my project. I have a database called WEATHER with a table called DATA which contains all of the userinput weather data temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speeddirection, etc which I pull using a QUERY via a file called data.php. Here is said file p  precodeltphp con  mysqlconnectfreed,weather,weather  if con    dieCould not connect  . mysqlerror   mysqlselectdbweather, con  result  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM avgtemp  whilerow  mysqlfetcharrayresult    echo row[DATEdatetime] . t . row[AVGtemperature] . n   mysqlclosecon gt codepre  pNow, as you can see, what I have done is create views p  precodeSELECT AVGtemperature,DATEdatetime FROM data WHERE datetime BETWEEN 20150101 AND 20150228 GROUP BY WEEKOFYEARdatetime ORDER BY WEEKdatetime ASC codepre  pfor the specific data that Id like to pull, as HighCharts seems unable to query things like AVGtemperature directly. It seems fine, however, to create the views and then reference them accordingly. Now, the problem is, I can only pull two sets of data at at time into the views. If I create a view with more than just two sets of data, the graph refuses to render. I would like to be able to pull all of my data so that I can have all weather data as plot points. If I add more to the above query after AVGtemperature, such as AVGhumidity the graph refuses to render any points, just the background. I believe the problem lies in the following PHP which is used to generate the graph, but could also be some formatting in the above data.php p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt  ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8gt    lttitlegtUsing Highcharts with PHP and MySQLlttitlegt  ltscript typetextjavascript src..jsjquery1.7.1.min.js gtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript src..jshighcharts.js gtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript src..jsthemesgray.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     var chart             document.readyfunction                  var options                       chart                          renderTo container,                         defaultSeriesType line,                         marginRight 130,                         marginBottom 25                     ,                     title                          text Temperature,                         x 20 center                     ,                     subtitle                          text ,                         x 20                     ,                     xAxis                          type datetime,                         dateTimeLabelFormats   dont display dummy year                             month e. b,                             year b                         ,                         ,                     yAxis                          title                              text Temperature                         ,                         plotLines [                             value 0,                             width 1,                             color 808080                         ]                     ,                     tooltip                          headerFormat ltbgtseries.nameltbgtltbrgt,                         pointFormat point.xe. b point.y,2f m                     ,                     legend                          layout vertical,                         align right,                         verticalAlign top,                         x 10,                         y 100,                         borderWidth 0                     ,                     series [                         name Count                     ]                                   Load data asynchronously using jQuery.

Negative 45162 pI am making a Color class, and provide a standard constructor likep  precodeColorint red, int green, int blue codepre  pAnd then I want to provide an easy way to get the most common colors, like Color.Blue, Color.Red. I see two possible optionsp  precodepublic static readonly Color Red  new Color255, 0, 0  public static Color Red  get  return new Color255, 0, 0   codepre  pWhat I dont fully understand is if there is an advantage of one over the other, and how exactly the static keyword works. My thoughts are The first creates one instance, and then that instance stays in memory for the entire duration of the program, and every time Red is called, this instance is used. The latter only creates something when first used, but creates a new instance every time. If this is correct, then I would argue that if I supply a lot of predefined colors, then the first would use a lot of unnecessary memory So it is memory usage vs the runtime overhead of instantiating an object every time I guess. p  pIs my reasoning correct Any advice for best practices when designing classes and use of the static keyword would be great.p

Negative 45162 pI am developing a report in Sql Server Reporting Services 2005, connecting to an Oracle 11g database. As you post replies perhaps it will help to know that Im skilled in MSSQL Server and inexperienced in Oracle.p  pI have multiple nested subreports and need to use summary data in outer reports and the same data but in detail in the inner reports. In order to spare the DB server from multiple executions, I thought to populate some temp tables at the beginning and then query just them the multiple times in the report and the subreports.p  pIn SSRS, Datasets are evidently executed in the order they appear in the RDL file. And you can have a dataset that doesnt return a rowset. So I created a stored procedure to populate my four temp tables and made this the first Dataset in my report. This SP works when I run it from SQLDeveloper and I can query the data from the temp tables. However, this didnt appear to work out because SSRS was apparently not reusing the same session, so even though the global temporary tables were created with ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS my Datasets were empty.p  pI switched to using real tables and am now passing in an additional parameter, a GUID in string form, uniquely generated on each new execution, that is part of the primary key of each table, so I can get back just the rows for this execution.p  pRunning this from Sql Developer works fine, examplep  precodeDECLARE ActivityCode varchar215  12080916       ExecutionID varchar232  SYSGUID BEGIN CIPProjectBudget ActivityCode, ExecutionID END codepre  pNever mind that in this example I dont know the GUID, this simply proves it works because rows are inserted to my four tables.p  pBut in the SSRS report, Im still getting no rows in my Datasets and SQL Developer confirms no rows are being inserted.p  pSo Im thinking along the lines ofp  ul liOracle uses implicit transactions and my changes arent getting committedli liEven though I can prove that the nonrowset returning SP is executing because if I leave out the parameter mapping it complains at report rendering time about not having enough parameters perhaps its not emreallyem executing. Somehow.li liWrong execution order isnt the problem or rows would appear in the tables, and they arent.li ul  pIm interested in any ideas about how to accomplish this especially the part about not running the main queries multiple times. Ill redesign my whole report. Ill stop using a stored procedure. Suggest anything you like I just need help getting this working and I am stuck.p  pIf you want more details, in my SSRS report I have a List object its a container that repeats once for each row in a Dataset that has some header values and then contains a subreport. Eventually, there will be four total reports one main report, with three nested subreports. Each subreport will be in a List on the parent report.p

Im looking to build something serious.p  pLooking at a modern Cocoa application like iPhoto or Mail or Things or.... many apps use the SingleWindow, SourceList based approach. Im trying to wrap my head around that as best I can because it seems to provide a good experience. However, Im having a little trouble. Heres how I think it should look, but Im wondering how others are doing it, and whats really the best wayp  ul lipStarting point of the app is an AppDelegate object which, after launching, creates a Window[Controller] from a nib, along with setting up its data from, say CoreDatapli lipWindowController loads a window which essentially just has an NSSplitView in it.pli lipLeft side of the splitview has an NSTableView or NSOutlineView which is set to have the SourceList style.pli lipRight side has the main content of the app, depending on which item of the table view is selected.pli ul  pI would assume somewhere where there are NSViewControllers managing each of the different views which will appear in the right side think how iPhoto has All Photos, Events, Faces, Places, etc. and I imagine they could all appear in different nibs... is this correct.p  pThose view controllers are probably bound to the source list on the left.. how does that work source list is backed by an NSArrayController of NSViewControllers maybe.p  pAnyway, those are my thoughts, am I completely offbase or... Ive looked around the web, found this post a hrefhttpcocoawithlove.com200808applicationdesigninappkit.htmlherea, and Ive looked at some Apple source code but I cant seem to wrap my head around it.

So if you visit this website a hrefhttpwww.ninjasliveclancodes.com relnofollowhttpwww.ninjasliveclancodes.coma and look at top right where it says World War and pay attention to it because after you refresh a few times you should see its icon picture move down a little bit closing the gap between the picture and the word World War. I found out they would all react this way if there was a space within the word. Anyone know why is it doing this Also, how can I stop it from doing that by either eliminating the gap or have it stayp  pstrongEditstrong Either way, I would still like to know how can I close in the gap between icon and word.

Negative 45162 pIm trying to push packets of data from my HTTP server to a browser, using a Comet forever iframe and feeding it script tags from the server using the TransferEncoding chunked header.  What Im finding is that my script tags arent being interpreted right away, and I have to send a number of chunks before the browser starts to respond to them.  In the case of IE8 this seems to require something like 256 bytes worth of data I havent checked precisely, and in Firefox 3.5.7 it seems to be something over a kilobyte.  I havent yet managed to get Chrome to respond to the script tags at all before the connection closes.  However in all cases if I end the chunked data with the 0 chunk, any buffered chunks are interpreted.  Ive found some a hrefhttpcometdaily.com20071211thefutureofcometpart1comettoday relnofollowreferencea to this kind of behaviour on Safari, but have not found any such information for other browsers.p  pWhat Id like to know is how can I reliably execute these script tags as they are sent, without what seems to be some kind of buffering mechanism delaying their executionp

Negative 45162 pI created an AS3 preloader, and placed the code for that on frame one. p  pI then made a symbol, and placed it in the library. It was set to NOT export on frame 1, and the flas settings had all classes exported on frame two. There were no references to the object until frame two.p  pThen, flash crashed whenever I compiled without the Export in frame one box checked.p  pTo fix this, a friend suggested I start my game logic on frame 3, so it will have properly loaded frame 2. That seemed to work fine, the class was instantiating properly.p  pThen, it turned out that it was not loading the movieclip, only instantiating the class. Again, this could be fixed by exporting in frame 1, but I really cannot afford to do that.p  pThe same friend suggested I place an instance of the symbol on the stage on frame 3, and perform game logic on frame 4. They said this would initialize the movieclip properly.p  pHowever, this was not the case.

Negative 45162 pI have run into a frustrating issue which I originally thought was a connection leak but that does not seem to be the case.  The secnario is this  the data access for this application is using the Enterprise Libraries v4 from Microsoft.

It seems that when the the database reaches 113 connections is when I recieve this error. Here is what makes this weirdp  pI have run similar code with the entlib on high traffic sites and have NEVER had this problem ever.p  pIf I kill all the connections to the database and get the production application back up and running everytime I refresh the application I can run this SQLp  precodeSELECT DBNAMEdbid as Database Name,  COUNTdbid as Total Connections  FROM sys.sysprocesses WITH nolock WHERE dbid gt 0 GROUP BY dbid codepre  pI can see the number of connections actively increasing with each page refresh. Running the same code on my local box with the same connection string does not cause this problem. Further if the production website is down I can fire up the site via Visual Studio and run it fine and the only difference between the two is that the production site has Windows authentication turned on and my local copy doesnt. Turning windows authentication off seems to have no effect on the server. p  pI have absolutely no clue what is causing this or why the connections are not being disposed of in SQL Server.  The EntLib objects do no explose .Close methods for anything so I cant explictily close the object.p  pAny thoughts Thanksp  pbEditbp  pWow I just noticed that I never actually posted the error message. Oy.  The actual connection error is bTimeout expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to obtaining a connection from the pool.

Negative 45162 pA Flash actually Flex object is created on an ASP.Net page within an Update Panel using a modified version of the embedCallACFLRunContent.js script so it can be written in dynamically.

Negative 45162 pLets say I have a database filled with people with the following data elementsp  ul liPersonID meaningless surrogate autonumberli liFirstNameli liMiddleInitialli liLastNameli liNameSuffixli liDateOfBirthli liAlternateID like an SSN, Militarty ID, etc.li ul  pI get lots of data feeds in from all kinds of formats with every reasonable variation on these pieces of information you could think of. Some examples arep  ul liFullName, DOBli liFullName, Last 4 SSNli liFirst, Last, DOBli ul  pWhen this data comes in, I need to write something to match it up. I dont need, or expect, to get more than an 80 match rate. After the automated match, Ill present the uncertain matches on a web page for someone to manually match.p  pSome of the complexities arep  ol liSome data matches are better than others, and I would like to assign weight to those. For example, if the SSN matches exactly but the name is off because someone goes by their middle name, I would like to assign a much higher confidence value to that match than if the names match exactly but the SSNs are off.li liThe name matching has some difficulties. John Doe Jr is the same as John Doe II, but not the same as John Doe Sr., and if I get John Doe and no other information, I need to be sure the system doesnt pick one because theres no way to determine who to pick.li liFirst name matching is really hard. You have BobRobert, JohnJonJonathon, TomThomas, etc.li liJust because I have a feed with FullNameDOB doesnt mean the DOB field is filled for every record. I dont want to miss a linkage just because the unmatched DOB kills the matching score. If a field is missing, I want to exclude it from the elements available for matching.li liIf someone manually matches, I want their match to affect all future matches. So, if we ever get the same exact data again, theres no reason not to automatically match it up next time.li ol  pIve seen that SSIS has fuzzy matching, but we dont use SSIS currently, and I find it pretty kludgy and nearly impossible to version control so its not my first choice of a tool.

Negative 45162 pWe are planning to develop a Silverlight cross platform application, that is expected to run on both Windows and Mac with elevated permissions.

One option might be to use Monos XSP web server, and run an ASP.NET site from the local machine, and host the XAP locally, and then implement a handshake with the ASP.NET code running via MonoXSP, and then do the interfacing from there.p  pAnother option will be to host the Silverlight in the Monos Winforms browser control I still need to see if this is possible, and then do the talking between Mono Winforms browser and Silverlight via HTML DOM.p  pBoth are not straight forward options in Mac.p  pI highly appreciate any inputs you can provide to achieve the objectives in a better way.p

Negative 45162 pEach member of our development team has a copy of our applications database running on a local version of SQL Server 2008 Enterprise with SP1. Everyone is able to access the database by specifying their server and instance name in their web.config file, but to best share the developer version of our web.config file, we have standardized on making connections strings generic by using integrated security and setting server property to local. This strategy is working fine for the majority of our 64bit Windows 7 machines but in few cases local isnt recognized. We have compared settings via the SQL Server Configuration Manager namely ensuring that the named pipes protocol was enabled and weve tried setting the local alias via SQL Server Client Network Utility, but we havent any luck. What needs to be done in order to use local in our connections strings p

Negative 45162 pGreetings Stackers.p  pWere working on a project which stores secondtosecond tracking data for participants in psych experiments.  Our current design has a Flash client which collects 60 seconds worth of timestampactivity pairings and then posts the data as strings, along with a little participant metadata to our rails 3.0.3  MySQL 5.1 application. strongEditstrong Were using vanilla PassengerNginx for the front.  Rails splits the timestampactivity strings into parallel arrays, generates a single raw SQL insert statement, and then shoves everything into a massive table, i.e  simplified codep  precodefeedbackdata  params[feedbackValues].split, feedbacktimes  params[feedbackTimes].split, inserts  [] base    userid  ,  studyid  , feedbackdata.eachwithindex do e,i   record  base  feedbacktimes[i].tos  ,   record    feedbackdata[i].tos     inserts.pushrecord end sql  INSERT INTO excitementdatas participantId, studyId, timestamp, activityLevel VALUES inserts.join,  ActiveRecordBase.connection.execute sql codepre  pYieldsp  precodeINSERT INTO STUDYDATA participantId, studyId, timestamp, activityLevel VALUES 3,5,20110127 050221,47,3,5,20110127 050222,56,etc. codepre  pThe design has generated a lot of debate on the team.  Studies will have 10s or 100s of concurrent participants.  Ive staggered the 60 second POST interval for each client so that incoming data is distributed more evenly, but Im still getting lots of doom and gloom predictions.  p  pWhat else can we do  should we do to improve the scalability of this design in railsp  pWhat tools  techniques can I use to accurately predict how this performs under loadp  pMany thanks.p

Negative 45162 pI am exploring the possibility of using ClickOnce to publish an application. I would like to change the install and update location on a percustomer basis, so that customers can host the install and update folder on a local intranet if they want. I have read about this, and it would seem that the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryxhctdw5528vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowMageUI.exea tool will do some of this, but I am just wondering if anyone has used this in a production environment and how must of a problem is it And does anyone have a link to a good guide on thisp  pI can imagine this would get complicated if say for example we have 40 customers each with their own deployment and hence 40 deployment manifests. Then I make a change to the application, I would have to then create 40 new deployment manifests could be done in a batch file I guess and send these outp

Negative 45162 pI need to implement a cache in java with a maximum size, would like to do it using the real size of the cache in the memory and not the number of elements in the cache. This cache will basically have String as key and String as value. I have already implemented the cache using the LinkedHashMap structure of java but the question is how to know the actual size of the cache so that i can adapt the policy to drop an object when the size is too big.p  pWanted to compute it using the getObjectSize of the instrumentation package but it seems not working as desired.p  pWhen I do getObjectSize a string  whatever the size of the string is, it returns the same size  32. I guess its just using the reference size of the string or something like that and not the content. So dont know how to solve this problem efficiently. p  pDo you have any ideas  p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 45162 pI am calling the server every 5 secs to get the data, then looping through my list and appending a span with the right data to my list. The problem is i cant make the span dissapear when data returned from the server is empty, except when i use fadeOut on the span. But then i cant calculate the right sum of all the li span countCont , since they are still appended to the DOM and have a value.  So what i would like to do is remove the respective li span if data returned from the server that is assigned to it is empty, so i can calculate the right sum.

Negative 45162 pIm attempting to get feedback from some hardware that is used over USB TMC and SCPI. I can read and write to the device using codedevusbtmc0code in a C [io]fstream, alternating by reading and writing to send and receive messages. Most commands are terminated by a single newline, so its easy to tell when the end of a response is received. The simplified code Im using for that isp  precodefstream usb usb.opendevusbtmc0, fstreamin if usb.good      string output     getlineusb, output     usb.close      do things with output   additional cleanup code... codepre  pThere is, however, one thing that is escaping me, and its defined in the SCPIIEEE spec as LRN. When sent, the connected device will send back arbitrary data actual wording from the specification that can be used to later reprogram the device should it get into a weird state.p  pThe issue with the response message of this LRN command is that it contains one or more newlines. It does properly terminate the entire message with a newline, but the fact that there are newlines embedded makes it really tricky to work with. Some hardware will prefix the payload with a length, but some dont.p  pWhen reading data from the hardware, there is a 5 second timeout built into the Linux usbtmc kernel driver that will block any read calls if you try to read past whats available. Using fstreameof doesnt seem to return anything useful. It acts much like a socket. Is there any way that I can read all data on the device without knowing about its length, termination, and while avoiding a kernel timeoutp

So originbranch1 and originbranch2 are known as remotetracking branches.  However, you cant commit directly onto a remotetracking branch an anonymous branch will be created instead.  A remotetracking branch simply tracks a remote branch when running git fetch.p  pHeres where the semantics get a little blurry for me.

Switched to a new branch branch1p  pHeres my question, put as verbosely as possible to clarify whats confusing me... By virtue of having branch1 set up to track remote branch branch1 from origin, is branch1 thus considered a remotetracking branch  If so, doesnt this conflict with the fact that originbranch1 was already listed as a remote tracking branch when running git branch r  From what I understand, there exist either local topic branches or remotetracking branches.  When running git checkout b branch1 originbranch1, am I creating a local topic branch onto which I can add commits that is tracking a remote branch by way of fetches  Running git branch now gives  branch1, and running git branch r still gives originbranch1 and originbranch2.  I created branch1 to add commits to and to track originbranch1.  Which is considered the remotetracking branch, branch1 from the output of git branch, or originbranch1 from the output of git branch rp

Negative 45162 pOkay, so I am trying to simulate the collision of balls on a 2Dimensional plane. I can detect the collisions pretty easily using a simple comparison of positions and the sum of radii, however, sometimes the simulation gets ahead of itself and the circles overlap, which plays havoc with the rest of the simulation.p  pSo I have figured that finding the normal vector between the two circles at the point of contact and adding onto the position vectors in that direction is what I need to do basically, and luckily I had a similar algorithm handling the velocity changes due to collisions so I adapted it thuslyp  precodeVector2 normal  orgA.getCenterPosition  orgB.getCenterPosition Vector2 tangent  new Vector2normal.Y  1, normal.X  float diff  orgA.getRadius  orgB.getRadius  normal.Length  normal.Normalize  float PAn  Vector2.Dotnormal, orgA.position float PAt  Vector2.Dottangent, orgA.position  PAn  diff  float PBn  Vector2.Dotnormal, orgB.position float PBt  Vector2.Dottangent, orgB.position  PBn  diff  Vector2 PA  PAn  normal  PAt  tangent Vector2 PB  PBn  normal  PBt  tangent  orgA.position  PA orgB.position  PB codepre  pThe trouble is that when I run the simulation, and two balls meet, the whole thing goes crazy and theyre suddenly going all over the shop.p  pCan anyone see the flaw in my algorithm Ive looked at it loads and I still cant find whats causing this.p
Negative 45162 pHey guys I wanted to know if I get get some advice from some asp.NET MVC and Ajax users. Im building a tool that allows you create a wishlist app and wanted to add ajax to it and make it more dynamic.p  pFor example. Users can enter a shopping term, I will pull up a list of productsfrom various apis and web services and then they add in a descriptionwhy they want it and hit submit. I will add the itemcustom class like WishListItem.vb to the listWishList.vb and display the item and description on the page. They can keep doing this over and over.p  pBut getting a postback every time is annoying and not very user friendly. So I wanted to add Ajax functionality to it. And wanted to know if you guys had some good ways with jQuery and straight Javascript to do it.p  pFor example when the users type in want they want and its description and hit submit. I will add it to their list via ajax. And update the content display said the list with ajax. Like it would show a progress bar and then display the list with the newly add item.p  pI see some Ajax.BeginForm in the views, and wanted to get some guidance on the best way to implement this.p  pI was wondering how can I get my View to communicate with the Model, and vice versa which I know shouldnt happen. But how else would I add items to the list and update the html with Ajaxp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 45162 pI have two c files producer.c and consumer.c. Consumer creates a shared buffer in memory and waits producer to put items into buffer to consume. Producer attaches shared memory to its memory map, then starts putting items into buffer.p  pThe question is how to compile and run them togetherp  pHere is the actual assignment. I know I can do it with one c file using threads, but this is not I am asked to do.p  blockquote   pIn this part you will develop a producerconsumer application that   will use shared  memory for process communication POSIX shared   memory, not System V shared  memory. There will be N producers and N   consumers. N can be 1, 2, or 3.   p      pYou will develop a producer program producer.c and a consumer   program  consumer.c. When started, the producer program will create   N child processes which  will be acting as N producers i.e. each   child process will be a producer process. p      pSimilarly, when started, the consumer program will create N child   processes, where  each child process will be acting as a consumer   process. You will consider that  consumers are identified as 0, 1, 2,   depending on N. For example, if N is 2, then there  will two   consumers, 0 and 1.  p      pThe consumer program will be run first. When run, the consumer program   will first create  a shared memory of size  4 KB. This shared memory   will be the place where you will  have a shared single buffer sitting.   The buffer can be accessed by producers and  consumers. The buffer   size is 100. It can hold at most 100 items integers. In the shared    memory you can have some other shared variables that you feel   necessary. The  consumer program will also create one or  more   semaphores you decide how many. p      pThen it will create N child processes N consumers using the fork   system call You will  not need to use the exec system call. The   main process of the consumer program  parent, after creating the   child processes, should not terminate. It should wait until all    children i.e. consumers finish their tasks and terminate. When all   children terminate, it  will remove delete the shared memory from   the system. It will also remove delete the  semaphores.  Then it can   terminate as well.  p      pEach producer will read an input file of positive integers one   integer per line and will  just pass the integers through a shared   buffer sitting in a shared memory created by the  consumer program   between the producers and consumers.  p      pEach consumer will read integers from the shared buffer and will write   a received integer  z to an output file associated with consumer if  z   mod N is equal to the ID of the  consumer.  For example, if N is 3 and   if the ID of a consumer is 2 and the consumer has   received an   integer 7, it will do nothing with it ignore, but if it receives 8,   it will write the integer to its output file. An output file will   contain one integer in a line.    While producers and consumers are   accessing the shared buffer, they should use  semaphores so that   access is synchronized. Additionally, if the buffer is full, producers   should sleep, and if there is nothing to consume, consumers should   sleep. We should  not have busy waiting. You will use POSIX semaphores   named semaphores. The consumer program will be invoked as followsbr   consumer  N       p      pHere, N is the number of consumer processes to be created.  The value   of this  parameter must be the same with the corresponding parameter   of the producer program.    Here, the  is the name of the   output file that will be used by the consumer with  ID X.  The number   of output file names entered will be equal to N.  is a name  we   can use to identify the shared memory.  is a name we can use to   identify  the semaphores it can be a prefix that can be used for   names of many semaphores.  These same names must be used when   invoking the producer.   The producer program will be named as   producer and will be invoked with the following  parametersbr   producer N        p      pHere, N is the number of producers. The  is the name of an   input file for  producer X. An input file is a text file storing   integers.  The number of input file names we enter will be equal to N.   There can be one or more integers in a file. An input file can be   quite huge billions of integers.  is a name we can use to   identify the shared  memory.  is a name we can use to identify   the semaphores.p      pAn example invocation of the programs can be like the following.br   consumer 3 out0.txt out1.txt out2.txt mysmem mysemaphores  producer 3   in0.txt in1.txt in2.txt mysmem mysemaphorep blockquote

Negative 45162 pIm updating a setup project that had one feature with a corresponding configuration dialog for that feature.br  Now I need to add one more feature with its own configuration dialog to the setup project and, when the user chooses the feature1 display feature1s configuration dialog, when the user chooses feature2 display feature2s configuration dialog and when the user chooses both features display the feature1s then feature2s configuration dialogs in a sequence. Obviously if the user chooses none, setup program cant continue because it has no features to install. That last rule is not reflected here in the project yet.

Negative 45162 pIm trying to work out why my app is using so much memory. I often see it using between 15 and 18MB, which is substantially higher than Id expect. I took a look at the heap size via DDMS and saw thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comq5rWa.png altenter image description herep  pThat looked a tad suspicous because my app doesnt deal with large images at all. In fact the total sum of the drawables in my app is about 250KB. So I created a heap dump and used MAT to locate where all this memory was going. byte[] arrays were by far the greatest consumer, so I drilled down and noticed the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8SUSr.png altenter image description herep  pI have absolutely no idea why sPreloadedDrawables is responsible for such a high retained heap size. I also have no idea of how to identify the root cause, or how to fix it.p  pWhere should I go from here My app works mostly in the background via services which dont deal with image data at all. I do have Activities that the user may choose to use, but again, they use small drawables which dont explain such a large heap size. I also checked for any nasty occurances of Activity leaks etc, but didnt locate any.p  pAny ideasp  pEDIT I noticed that the heap size is substantially lower when run in the emulator. This is quite confusing. p

Negative 45162 pI want a codeltdivgtcode that reacts and fits the screen window size. The codeltdivgtcode is supposed to have the dimensions 23 So that the height is 33 and the width is 23. It is easy enough to make it in css by writing codewidth 200pxcode and codeheight300pxcode.p  pThe thing is that I want the height of the codeltdivgtcode to resize depending on the screensize.  And also I want the text inside of it to resize. I know it is possible by javascript or jQuery, but I really dont know how. Something like taking the height and split it in three, and then times two, and then make code.csswidth,newWidthcodep  pAnd it should be about the same thing with the text inside of it.p  pI found the correct way to do it. I had to change a little bit, but it works now.p  precodewindow.resizefunction  var ratio  0.6 hovsa.widthwindow.height  ratio.heightwindow.height  instead of directly using window.width  ratio, you can call a method to  calculate width and height each time window is resized.  codepre  pI have changed the width to be strongheight  ratiostrong and it worked very well. The only thing I need to do now is to make the fontsize going the same way as well.p

Negative 45162 pBefore I go on, this is purely a question of intuition.  That is, Im not seeking answers to work out specific bugs in my PHPMySQL code.  Rather, I want to understand what the range of possible issues that I need to consider in resolving my issue.  To these ends, I will not post code or attach scripts  I will simply explain what I did and what is happening.p  pI have written PHP script thatp  ol liReads a CSV text file of X records to be inserted into a MySQL database table strongandor update duplicatestrong entries where applicableli liInserts said records into what I will call a root table for that data setli liSelects subset records of specific fields from the root table and then inserts those records into a master table andli liCreates an output export text file from the master table for distribution.li ol  pThere are several CSV files that I am processing via separate scheduled cron tasks every 30 minutes.  All said, from the various sources, there are an estimated 420,000 insert transactions from file to root table, and another 420,000 insert transactions from root table to master table via the scheduled tasks.p  pOne of the tasks involves a CSV file of about 400,000 records by itself.  The processing contains no errors, but heres the problem  of the 400,000 records that MySQL indicates have been successfully inserted into the root table, only about 92,000 of those records actually store in the root table  Im losing about 308,000 records from that scheduled task.p  pThe other scheduled tasks process about 16,000 and 1,000 transactions respectively, and these transactions process perfectly.  In fact, if I reduce the number of transactions from 400,000 to, say, 10,000, then these process just fine as well.  Clearly, thats not the goal here.p  pTo address this issue, I have tried several remedies...p  ol liUpping the memory of my server and increasing the max limit in the php.ini fileli liGetting a dedicated database with expanded memory as opposed to a shared VPS databaseli liRewriting my code to substantially eliminate stored arrays that suck down memory and process fgetcsv processes on the runli liUse INSERT DELAYED MySQL statements as opposed to plain INSERT statementsli ol  p...and none of these remedies have worked as desired.p  pWhat range of remedial actions should be considered at this point, given the lack of success in the actions taken so far  Thanks...p

Negative 45162 pSorry if this question is too simple but it is something that I have always wondered and I would like to hear the opinion of an expert. p  pI have always used strongNSLog,objectstrong to check the string of a strongNSStringstrong, or to see what a strongNSDictionarystrong has inside. So I am really curious about if you can use this technique to strongNSLogstrong all objects in objective C.p  pAccording to my experience, a strongNSLogstrong to an object who doesnt have text like content will simply give you the instance description, which will be the object class and instance number I think like an strongUIViewstrong or a strongUIButtonstrong. p  pIs there any situation in where I would get an strongEXEBADACCESSstrong for logging an object not a structureprimitive variable Or can I keep doing this as I have so farp  pThanks.p

However such a change would propagate through all my code and would force me to create two different versions for each class that uses codeFoo1code and codeFoo2code e.g. Id have to create codeFooContainer1code and codeFooContainer2code. p  pA less intrusive way of doing this would be to create p  precodeclass Bar public Foo, public Decorator1, public Decorator2     codepre  pand use this instead of codeFoocode. In this case Id call only the functions I need from codeDecorator1code and codeDecorator2code and ignore the others, but this seems to go against good OOP techniques. p  pAny suggestions regarding the problem p

Negative 45162 pIm trying to build an image upload system like Facebooks where when you mouseover an image, a button a div, not an actual html button appears to select an image.  So far, Im using jQuerys hover method.  The problem is, when I hover over the image, the button appears, but then when I hover over the button, the function assumes Im no longer hovering over the image, and the button disappears.  Of course then since the button is gone, Im hovering over the image again and the button reappears.  The end result is this sort of flickering effect when I move my mouse on the image.p  pI cant seem to figure out a way around it.  I tried creating a separate hover event for the button itself that removes the hover event for the image and then replaces it on mouseout, but the image mouseout event seems to fire first, and it does nothing.p  pOnly thing I can think is to use a setTimeout, but this seems sloppy.  Seeing as Facebook is doing something similar, Im sure theres a super clean way to handle it.p  pAny thoughts  Thanksp

Its contents look likep  precodecommentfile02389.txt,lastmodifiedWed Oct 10 191049 commentfile02342.txt,lastmodifiedWed Oct 10 171608 commentfile02315.txt,lastmodifiedWed Oct 10 184512 commentfile02344.txt,lastmodifiedWed Oct 10 083101 codepre  pThe log is given as a single String with no line breaks. I want to parse the String to find the file which was most recently modified, i.e., has the latest date so file02389.txt in this case. The character length of each comment is constant though hypothetically could change in the future and the file names wont be unique if the same file is modified more than once.p  pstrongIs there a most extensiblemaintainable way of finding the most recent file Execution time and memory arent are as important factors. The main concern is that a beginner programmer can understand and work with the code.strongp  pMy first thought was to split the String into a List that can be sorted with a custom Comparator. I consider this to be simple but not extensible p  precodegiven String log ... setup ListltStringgt temp  Arrays.asListlog.trim.splitcomment too complex for one line the first entry is blank so it must be removed else a substring call will fail iftemp.get0.equals     temp.remove0 int period  full.get0.indexOf. int colon  full.get0.indexOf  process Collections.sorttemp, DATE return test.gettest.size1.substring0, period last entry is the most recent   public final ComparatorltStringgt DATE  new ComparatorltStringgt  public int compareString s1, String s2              return s1.substring28.compareTos2.substring28        codepre  pIt works but uses substrings that depend on the line length and a Comparator that is only useful in this single case. I dislike the use of .split and then having to remove the first entry but I want to avoid a true and hard to understand regex if that is an alternative. Treating the dates as Strings instead of comparing as Integers or date objects seems undesirable but saves lines of code.p  pI currently use a sorted map that avoids creating a singleuse Comparator with a randomlooking number but a specialized map seems rather complex for what Im trying to do. I still think its better than creating one array for the file names, another for the times, then a third to copy the times so the times array can be sorted and its last value compared with the corresponding index in the copy.p  precode ... same setup as before process key is time, value is file name SortedMapltString, Stringgt map  new TreeMapltString, Stringgt forString s  temp     map.puts.substringcolon1, s.substring0, period the value to which the last key is mapped is guaranteed to be the most recent file return map.getmap.lastKey too complex for one line  codepre

Negative 45162 pI have a 3D model and while rendering i am using shaders to calculate the vertex colorcomputationally intensive task, based on some parameters. These parameters change with time. So basically i need to calculate the vertex color based on the present parameters and sum it up with the previously rendered vertex color. I will be dealing with models that have 510 million vertices. Can someone please help me with ways to solve this problem.p  pSorry for the unclear question.  The problem i am facing is how to backup the previous vertex color calculated from the shader. I cannot use blending since the object can be rotated. So basically i need a mechanism to save the vertex color information calculated from shader and use it in the next pass.p

Negative 45162 pIm porting an iOS game to Android that uses 2 functionalities from GameCenter. Post score, and show leaderboard which shows a screen thats created and managed by the library, so all the game does is show it, and find out when its been closed.p  pIs there a library with similar features for Android OpenFeint doesnt seem to exist anymore, and all the alternatives I could find like Gree and Scoreloops seem to be too low level you can retrieve the data, but you have to make your own screens. Gree wasnt very clear on its documentation tho, so I might be missing something.p  pThanks.p

Negative 45162 pmy PC was upgraded to Win 7. This meant i now need to setup my Dev environment again. I use XAMPP. I was able to just copy amp paste XAMPP folder and then run setupxampp.bat to correctly set absolute file path in ini and config files.p  pThe issue I now face is that I need connection to oracle and I get several errors. But basically php does not find oci.dll. I have added the instantclient directory containing oci.dll to PATH environment variable and restarted restart is required for apache services to see this change. However I still get the same error.p  pI then copied oci.dll into php folder and then php.exe m  no error. So it is clear that somehow apache and php do not look in PATH variable to find oci.dll. Im lost as this worked fine in Win XP. Any ideas how I can solvep

Negative 45162 pThis seems like it should be easy, but the limitations of the codeltselectgtcode object are rather irritating.  I have a select box with four options, and when you navigate to a page, the option is set to the page you are on.  I want to make it so that the user can refresh the page by selecting the same option  that is, selecting the option thats already selected.p  pUnfortunately, the codeonclickcode event doesnt work across browsers.  Most people recommend using codeonchangecode, but that doesnt work in the case Im talking about.  The approach Ive been taking is to add an extra item at the top that holds whats currently selected and does nothing when clicked on, and then switch to that option after firing the onchange event, so that when the user reselects the option theyre actually changing.  Thats awkward though, because in the dropdown there are two of the same item, and I shouldnt have to do it.p  pWhat is a good crossbrowser way to solve this problem  Something not terribly complicated and something in regular JavaScript would be preferable.p

Negative 45162 pI had to relocate to another office due to weather related issues. In our old office, when we started an IIS application using windows authentication the application would pull your windows info and immediately sign in using your credentials. At our new location I have the same app and same settings, or so I thought and when a user starts the application a windows usernamepass box opens. The correct information is stored there and the user can just hit enter and move on but I was wondering why it doesnt just autolog in like at my other location Does something need to be set in web.configp

Many projects are write once and forget, so theyll never need updating.p  pThe team is very small at the moment ME but new devs are expected early this year, but it will still be a very small inhouse team, with fast project cycles if that makes any difference.p  pAt the moment I have a very flat folder structure on disk, so ALL of my codeslncode files are in a development folder on disk.

Negative 45162 pSo Im using a hrefhttpsmetacpan.orgmoduleCatalystPluginStatusMessageCatalystPluginStatusMessagea in my Catalyst app. The only issue is that right now I have a load balancer with two app servers behind it, both running catalyst. Because of this, if a status message is set on one app server, and then the user is redirected and then the load balancer sends them to the second app server, the user wont see the status message because the status messages are local to the app servers. Is there anyway that I could share these status messages across app servers, so that I dont have to worry which server the load balancer sends them to Thanksp

Negative 45162 pNew to SO my first questionp  pRe Core Data, document based app using bindingsp  pI have an strongNSTableViewstrong bound to an strongNSArrayControllerstrong, bound to an entity, strongLineItemstrong, with several columns bound to the following strongLineItemstrong attributesproperties emamountem, empriceem, and emtotalem. Im using strongkeyPathsForValuesAffectingTotalstrong to observe changes in emamountem and empriceem. The property, emtotalem, updates instantly with any changes.  I have another entity, strongItemstrong. It has a one to many relationship emitemsem with strongLineItemstrong since every strongItemstrong  can have many strongLineItemsstrong. strongItemstrong also has an strongNSTableViewstrong bound to an strongNSArrayControllerstrong, which is bound to its respective entity, strongItemstrong. This table has several columns as well, but one is, emlineItemTotalem items.sum.total.p  precode NSNumber lineItemTotal       float totalOfAllLineItemTotals  [[self valueForKeyPathitems.sum.total]floatValue]      [self willAccessValueForKeylineItemTotal]      return [NSNumber numberWithFloattotalOfAllLineItemTotals]      [self didAccessValueForKeylineItemTotal]      return [NSNumber numberWithFloattotalOfAllLineItemTotals]  codepre  pThe emlineItemTotalem value updates instantly with the use of an strongNSNotificationstrong emNSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotificationem, which calls my selector, updateLineItemTotal which sends a message [self.view setNeedsDisplayYES]  Everything works fine... However, this view should look like a receipt. As such, I have an NSTextField underneath the strongLineItemstrong Table to show the total, as the user would expect. I have tried binding it to the same strongNSArrayControllerstrong that strongItemstrong is, but this does not work. In the bindings Inspector, I cannot choose strongarrangedObjectsstrong for the strongController Keystrong, since it isnt a table. this is how the Item Table is set up and working fine My only choice is selection for the strongController Keystrong. In any case, it always shows the correct value, but only after I create a new Item instance via strongNSButtonstrong bound to add and return to the old Item instance. It does not update instantly like everything else a user would find this unprofessional. Ive tried the suggestions of Hillegass, searched Stack Overflow, and Apples recommended work arounds regarding updating values when dealing with an strongNSSetstrong. Apple recommends setting up a notification. I did that and this time it didnt work. Ive tried all the obvious workarounds with no success. I believe it comes down to strongKVCstrong amp strongKVOstrong unfortunately, Apple has little support for these powerful tools when working with strongNSSetsstrong, at least not on the surface. Any help would be appreciated. p

Negative 45162 pI recently started programming in PHP. For exercise Id like to build my own PHP text strategy game. One technical aspect needs some thinking.p  pIn my game every player must have the ability to gain resources, for example iron and grain. With these resources a player is able to recruit soldiers or build buildings. The resources are stored in a kind of warehouse.p  pThe resources will be gain in a period of time. In example you gain 100 grain a hour and that grain is stored in the warehouse. This means that every 0.6 minute, 1 grain has to be added. I have been looking to cron jobs but that is not the best answer to my problem because is takes too much system resource. The problem is that Id like to be able to update my resources in my warehouse every minute. Does anyone have an idea for my problemp

Negative 45162 pIve set my server to require authentication for all directories. Im using Apaches modauthform to generate an inline login form so as to preserve the HTTPREQUEST so that the module can keep the user at whatever filedirectory they had specified when being presented with the login form.p  pMy issue is this I navigate to the domain example.com and the login form is presented. Good. I login using incorrect credentials, login form shows again. Good. I enter correct credentials, get an Internal Server 500 error.p  pHowever, the weird thing that I dont understand is, if I were to visit a directory example.comimages the login form is presented as it should be, and if I login, it correctly logs me in and shows the directory index of images. This works with any subdirectory and even with any aliasd subdirectory Ive created in http.conf.p  pThe only time it messes up is just at the rootdomain level.

However, with a few web pages most particularly, google.com, the page initially loads well and after a few seconds automatically seems to refresh itself. The startfinish sequence looks as belowp  precode[MyWebView webViewDidStartLoad], 1, 0x895150c [MyWebView webViewdidFailLoadWithError], 0, 0x895150c [MyWebView webViewDidStartLoad], 1, 0x895150c [MyWebView webViewDidStartLoad], 2, 0x895150c [MyWebView webViewDidFinishLoad], 1, 0x895150c [MyWebView webViewDidFinishLoad], 0, 0x895150c [MyWebView webViewDidStartLoad], 1, 0x895150c   lt after a few seconds gap [MyWebView webViewDidFinishLoad], 0, 0x895150c codepre  pThe first argument is the function being called, second is the value of the counter and the last value is the address of the loadCounter, just to confirm that it is the same webView instance and hence the counter being called. I am running out of clues ... p  pDoes anyone have any clue, what might be happening here BTW, this does not happen for many other websites, so far only with Googlep  pEDIT Why it matters to me is, because while it refreshes apparently randomly, it dismisses the keyboard. This is annoying if a user is already in the middle of typing something. Is it possible to relegate any further refreshes to the site in the background, while continuing the user interaction particularly keyboard in the frontp  pTIA, Nikhilp

Negative 45162 pIm displaying a route on a map using MKPolyLine  this works fine. What Im not sure about, and cant find anything on SO relating to, is what is the best approach when I have a very large number of points For instance, if I have 60000 points, would it be a good idea to take only 1 in every 100 if the entire route is on screen, and recalculate every time the user panszooms the map Or does the Map Kit automatically optimize based on the current zoom level amp how much of the route is visible I have heard about Least Squares optimization, amp Im currently looking into that too.p  pThe difficulty for me at the moment is that my test devices are quite new with lots of memory, so I cant test on less capable devices.

Negative 45162 pIm developing an API using ruby and Sinatra for an already existing Rails App. Ive separated the applications no mounting logic, and these are therefore being deployed separately. On production Im using nginx as my proxy server for both applications, which uses domainmatching to dispatch to the right application. p  pIm also versioning my API. Currently Im doing it in the Sinatra application itself, by overwriting the methods which get, post, the filters, etc... call, so, whichever string or regex rules you apply to match the request uri, theyll have the versioning before them addedp  precode matches v0.1resourceid get resourceid .... codepre  pthis has the disadvantage of always having to match at least the start of the url, first  included, otherwise the version number will not be rightly added. Not only that, that means I also only match one version of the API per application.p  pIm still working on the first version, so theres time to figure out the best strategy to move on as version bumping of the API ensues. I see two possible strategiesp  ol lipMake it all a la Rails as they recommend on the railscast for rest API versioning and version the matching all the time in the appp  precodeget 0.1resourceid do ..... get 0.2resourceid do ..... codepre  pthis has the disadvantage of always having two or more versions of the logic, making the url matching logic more complex like, if I want to match all with one rule like dresourced, then Ill have to still see if the version number is acceptable and increase overall the spaghetti occurrences, in my eyes. p  pit has the advantage of maintaining the same deploy logic replace the last version by the current, nginx routes only to one API, etc....pli lipLet nginx dispatch by version. Using CVS I can version my code. Id just have to define how many versions of it would I want to support online, deploy them, and then rearrange the nginx routing, which would be now domainversion based. p  pThis has the advantage of cleaning the application logic, since I only match the necessary rules for the logic. using the last examplep  precodeget resourceid do .... codepre  pand nginx would take care of routing to the right application. p  pthis has a few technical disadvantages though for this to work, Ill have to change the deploy strategy, in that I have to choose how many versions of the API I support, fetch them from my CVS, then edit nginx configuration, delete the last API rules, insert the new ones route to api.myapp.comv1, api.myapp.comv2... and reinitialize nginx. The other disadvantage is that now I have to support more than one API code basis, for instance for bug fixing... which is the same as the above, Ill just have to support the different versiontagged code basis. pli ol  pI would like to know how others have solved this issue in their cases, and how that influenced the subsequent maintenance. p

Negative 45162 pIve been working on a console application for over two years, and although the code is always being improvedextended, I thought it would be helpful to add a GUI to it. After some initial stumbling blocks, I now have a basic GUI windows forms using CLI. Initially, I tried to get input from the GUI from within my main function It was my main function from the console app. Then I read that this is not a good idea, and I realised also that I dont want the input to my function potentially change after I click my Run button.p  pSo basically, Im wondering what the best programming practice is for this. The only way I really know how to do this is to open my main function from within my buttonclick event, and pass the values obtained from textboxes and checkboxes to it.p  pIm not even aware of another way, but this seems way too sloppy. There could potentially be over 100 values passed to the main function, and Ive never seen a function with this many arguments. In the past, I hardcoded them into my function, or used cin to alter them at runtime.p  pAny advice on this would be much appreciated. I dont want to continue doing what Im doing if its poor programming practice. I should also mention that my programming style is usually procedural, as I dont have much knowledge of OOP.p  pHere is an example to illustrate how Im doing it at the momentp  precodeprivate SystemVoid button1ClickSystemObject  sender, SystemEventArgs  e                 if  thisgtInput1gtTextgtLength  0                    thisgtInput1gtText  Enter number              else                 String In1Str  thisgtInput1gtText                 double In1  ConvertToDoubleIn1Str                 ifthisgtCBshowConsolegtChecked                     showConsole                 mainIn1           codepre  pSo, to reiterate, the way I would do it from here, would be to basically do this for Input2, Input3, Input4, etc., and then pass In2, In3, In4, etc. to my main function.p

Negative 45162 pI have a CSS animation that I want to run when the page is in view on the browser. I am doing this using a true or false function to get the position called posish. I can run it once when the page comes into view, or when posish is true 13900, but I also want to run it again once when posish becomes false. p  pMy problem is, if I set it up so true amp false both run the animation, the animation runs continuously as you scroll, whereas I only want it to run once for each instance until the instance changes to the opposite. Also, I have two classes running the same animation, so I can add and remove. I hope this makes sense Here is my codep  precodeif posish13900          .shadow.removeClassshrink2        .shadow.addClassshrink1  else      .shadow.removeClassshrink1     .shadow.addClassshrink2    codepre  pHere is the code for the posish functionp  precodefunction posishpos      pos19     if scrolledviewport4 lt pos          return false      else if scrolled gt posviewport2          return true      else          return scrolledviewport4posviewport4       codepre  pPlease let me know if you need anymore information.

Negative 45162 pHello everybody I have this kind of problem.  I have downloaded and activated Mysql on my laptop, which is a normal notebook, and then I use a GUI and I am trying to learn how to use Mysql. I actually am at the very beginning so now I am importing tables  in csv format  and trying to run on them the same queries I used to run in ms access. The point is that Mysql on the one side seems to keep any kind of table dimension, but on the other is esxtremely slow. In fact so slow I am sure I must be doing something wrong. I have two tables, each of them of 1400000 rows and 70 columns if I run a basic query on each of them for instance select all rows where field A1 is 23, then no problem. But if I run a query with a inner join between two tables then it is a disaster. I begun processing such a query 6 hours ago and its still going.....the same query, in ms access, took 15 seconds. Im sure I must be missing something. The OS is ubuntu 12.10, the GUI is Navicat 11. Thank you p

Im not sure what to do.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI have done more testing and find that if I use just a regular CALayer to mask another CALayer layer.mask  someOtherLayer I have the same performance issues. It seems that the problem isnt specific to CAShapeLayerrather it is specific to the mask property of CALayer. p  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pSo after learning more about using the Core Animation tool in Instruments, I learned that the view is being rendered offscreen each time it moves. Setting shouldRaster to YES when the touch begins and turning it off when the touch ends makes the view stay green thus keeping the cache in instruments, but performance is still terrible. I believe this is because even though the view is being cached, if it isnt opaque, than it still has to be rerendered with each frame.p  pstrongOne thing to emphasizestrong is that if there are only a few views being masked say even around ten the performance is pretty good. However, when you increase that to 100 or more, the performance lags. I imagine this is because when one moves over the others, they all have to be rerendered. p  pstrongMy conclusion is this,strong I have one of two options. p  pOne, there must be someway to permanently mask a view render it once and call it good. I know this can be done via the graphic or bitmap context route as I show in my example code, but when a layer masks its view, it happens instantly. When I do it in a bitmap context as shown, it is quite slow as in it almost cant even be compared how much slower it is. p  pTwo, there must be some faster way to do it via the bitmap context route. If there is an expert in masking images or views, their help would be very much appreciated.p

Of course, there is no output to codestdcoutcode and codestaticcastcode is used instead of codestdmovecode, so that they are valid codeconstexprcode definitions. And since in emC11em codeconstexprcode still implies codeconstcode, the overload commented out in the sample code cannot be provided as it would redefine the constqualified rvalue overload.p

Negative 45162 pAs far as I understand it, constexpr can be seen as a hint to the compiler to check whether given expressions can be evaluated at compiletime and do so if possible.p  pI know that it also imposes some restriction on the function or initialization declared as constexpr but the final goal is compiletime evaluation, isnt itp  pSo my question is, why cant we leave that at the compiler It is obviously capable of checking the preconditions, so why doesnt it do for each expression and evaluate at compiletime where possiblep  pI have two ideas on why this might be the case but I am not yet convinced that they hit the pointp  pa It might take too long during compiletime.p  pb Since my code can use constexpr functions in locations where normale functions would not be allowed the specifier is also kind of part of the declaration. If the compiler did everything by itself, one could use a function in a Carray definition with one version of the function but with the next version there might be a compilererror, because the preconditions for compiletime evaluation are no more satisfied.p

Negative 45162 pIm looking for an efficient algorithm to compute a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFactorialnumbersystem relnofollowfactorialbase representationa aka Cantor expansion of a given a codencodepermutation.p  pBy efficient I mean one with better than codeOnsup2supcode running time.p  hr  pBTW, I realize that there are multiple natural ways to map permutations to factorialbase representations, differing only in the conventions adopted, and that the algorithm Im looking for depends to some extent on the particular conventions chosen.  At the moment I have no strong preference on the matter, although this rests mostly on the unproven assumption that any algorithm written for one set of conventions will be easily converted to one supporting a different set of conventions, without any adverse effect on the running time.p  pFWIW, an example of an codeOnsup2supcodetime algorithm to compute a factorial base representation of a permutation of the list code0, 1, ..., n1code would be one that computes the codeicodeth digit, codedicode, of such a representation as the number of inversions in the given permutation between the codeicodeth element and some emsubsequentem element in the permutation.  p  pOr, in pseudocode, assuming 0based arraysp  precodefunction FACTORIALREPRESENTATIONp     n lt lengthp     d lt zerosn  1     for i lt 0 to n  3         for j lt i  1 to n  2             if p[i] gt p[j]                 d[i] lt d[i]  1     return d codepre  pFor example, given the permutation [2, 3, 1, 0] of [0, 1, 2, 3], the function above should return the array [2, 2, 1], corresponding to the inversionsp  ul li2  [strongem2emstrong, 3, strongem1emstrong, 0], [strongem2emstrong, 3, 1, strongem0emstrong]li li2  [2, strongem3emstrong, strongem1emstrong, 0], [2, strongem3emstrong, 1, strongem0emstrong]li li1  [2, 3, strongem1emstrong, strongem0emstrong]li ul  pSince counting inversions seems to me akin to sorting, and since sorting can be done in codeOnlogncode, I suppose that there may be at least an codeOnlogncode algorithm for doing this, but I have not been able to come up with it.p

Negative 45162 pI know this has been asked 1000 times, but I would still like to gather further clarification on the issue I face.p  pI am trying to test the throughput on mobile devices LTE, 3G, 2G. I am looking for a solution which is very accurate within reason.p  pMy original solution was to use an FTP server to perform upload and download tests, however I face the issue that the FTP server I use is simply not quick enough to support LTE. Getting a new FTP server isnt an option at this stage. I must also take into consideration how many HOPS it takes to get to the server.p  pI am not looking for a ready made solution like SpeedTest.net, I need something raw so that I can program my own scripts. I was thinking of doing something in PHP HTTP upload and downloadp  pMy idea was to have some sort of script on a PHP Server. However wont this be testing the servers speed, rather than the devicesp  pI forgot to mention that I will be testing the devices via internet tethering p  pAny input or suggestions would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanksp

Negative 45162 pWe have a large website that sends out different kinds of emails to their users newsletter, forgot password, random subscriptions created by users, etc.. The portal is pretty big and we need to send out thousands of emails per day. p  pThe way it is organized now is that all emails are queued in database and then there is a cron script that reads DB every several minutes and sends out the batch of X emails. This script is essentially a for loop that goes through these X emails and for each of them establishes an SMTP connection and sends the emails. This however overloads the server pretty heavily, basically most of the time server is busy sending out these emails one by one.p  pI was wondering whether there is some way to send these queued emails to the SMTP server in batches. If this involves some specialized software, thats on problem, we can set up our own SMTP server wed prefer LinuxUnix based one. For instance something that would work is running a cron every day, convert that queue into an XML file and send that XML file to the SMTP server and then SMTP server would parse it and send out all these emails.p

Negative 45162 pAn assignment in my Operating Systems class requires me to build a binary process tree by recursively calling exec on the same program.  The goal is to split some arbitrary task into separate processes.  The parent should communicate with the children, and the children with the parent only via unnamed pipes.

I also have PHP intertwined with JavaScript to test if PHP is active, if not it falls back to JavaScript functions. I also have jQuery, MooTools, and more like such... Not to mention all the required questions, textboxs, dropdowns, radio buttons, check boxes, and textareas.p  pThe problem is that Ive only completed one section of the online application and my file is already at 32 KB. Considering the amount of work Ive done, and what I have left to do, I can see this htmlphp .php file easly reaching 200KBp  pSo I need to know the true maximum limit to both the typical HTML browser and serverside PHP engine.p  pThanks in advance,p  pJamesp

Negative 45162 pI am using Kinect to play around with a websiteJS. That website has a 3d graph on it which can be interacted with. Left click and moving around rotates it while mouse wheel rotation increasesdecreases its size. I want to do all this using a Kinect.p  pThe problem I am facing isp  p1 I have given the zoom value i.e the dwData in mouseevent as the distance between right wrist and left wrist. This is making the zoom in zoom out happen but at a very slow pace I tried multiplying the zoom value with higher numbers and it did not work. Here is the relevant piece of codep  precodeinternal struct MouseInput              public int X         public int Y         public float MouseData         public uint Flags         public uint Time         public IntPtr ExtraInfo       internal struct Input              public int Type         public MouseInput MouseInput       Input[] i  new Input[1]  i[0]  new Input i[0].Type  InputMouse i[0].MouseInput.Flags  MouseEventWheel i[0].MouseInput.MouseData  zoomVal  1000  uint result  SendInput3, i, Marshal.SizeOfi[0] codepre  pIn the above code, zoomVal comes from the distance between the left and right wrist. I keep it as it is or multiply it with 1000, it still zooms at a very slow rate.p

Negative 45162 pI am writing a Fortran code which requires an FFT. I am using the double precision version of four1 from Numerical Recipes in Fortran 77 page 501. Below is a program to test the FFT. Below that is the output I get from the FFT along with the output I expect to get. The real part of the transform is correct within rounding errors, but the imaginary part is not. However, for my purposes, I do not even need the imaginary part, so should I be able to just grab the real part and continue with that It still bothers me that the output is not correct though and makes me think I dont understand something about the implimentation of this subroutine.p  pThe way I understand it, the values given to the array data when it is constructed are all real 1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0. And the imaginary values are all zero. Is that correct I am concerned that I am not giving the input array to the FFT in the form that it needs. When I use this subroutine in my actual program, what comes out of the FFT is somewhat nonsensical and the whole thing goes to NaNs after several timesteps.p  precodeprogram fftTest     implicit none        complexkind8, dimension8  data  1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0     integer  i      do i1,8         write,, F20.15, ,, F20.15, i  datai     end do print ,   call dfour1data,8,1      do i1,8         write,, F20.15, ,, F20.15, i  datai     end do print ,   call dfour1data,8,1 data  data8  do i1,8         write,, F20.15, ,, F20.15, i  datai     end do  end program fftTest      SUBROUTINE dfour1data,nn,isign         INTEGER isign,nn         DOUBLE PRECISION data2nn         INTEGER i,istep,j,m,mmax,n         DOUBLE PRECISION tempi,tempr         DOUBLE PRECISION theta,wi,wpi,wpr,wr,wtemp          n2nn         j1         do 11 i1,n,2 This is the bit reversal section of the routine.             ifj.gt.ithen             temprdataj Exchange the two complex numbers.             tempidataj1             datajdatai             dataj1datai1             dataitempr             datai1tempi         endif         mn2 1       if m.ge.2.and.j.gt.m then             jjm             mm2         goto 1         endif         jjm 11    continue       mmax2 Here begins the DanielsonLanczos section of the routine. 2     if n.gt.mmax then                              istep2mmax           theta6.28318530717959d0isignmmax           wpr2.d0sin0.5d0theta2           wpisintheta           wr1.d0           wi0.d0           do 13 m1,mmax,2  Here are the two nested inner loops.               do 12 im,n,istep                  jimmax   This is the DanielsonLanczos formula                  temprwrdatajwidataj1                  tempiwrdataj1widataj                  datajdataitempr                  dataj1datai1tempi                  dataidataitempr                  datai1datai1tempi 12        continue           wtempwr  Trigonometric recurrence           wrwrwprwiwpiwr           wiwiwprwtempwpiwi 13      continue         mmaxistep         goto 2  Not yet done.         endif   All done.         return      END codepre  pExpected correct outputbr        4.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        1.000000000000000,  2.414213562373095i br        0.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        1.000000000000000,  0.414213562373095i br        0.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        1.000000000000000,   0.414213562373095i br        0.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        1.000000000000000,   2.414213562373095i   p  pActual output from test programbr        1.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        1.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        1.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        1.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        0.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        0.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        0.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        0.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br      br        4.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        0.999999999999998,   2.414213562373094i br        0.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        0.999999999999999,   0.414213562373096i br        0.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        1.000000000000000,  0.414213562373094i br        0.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        1.000000000000003,  2.414213562373096i br      br        1.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        1.000000000000000,  0.000000000000000i br        1.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        1.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        0.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        0.000000000000000,   0.000000000000000i br        0.000000000000000,  0.000000000000000i br        0.000000000000000,  0.000000000000000i   p

I would like to build a programm that uses generics with the following methods add,remove,get,contains and size. But when I built the program I found out that the generics cannot create an array, so I used from another post in this site [How to generic array creation and used the weak typing unchecked. So the main theme of this program is someone to type in console his first name last and his phone number and then to put it in array of generics so I could save it into an object and then into a specific position. After that the program dynamically increases the threshold in order for the user to have a lot of contacts. Then he wil be told if his contact has been duplicated and it will be removed immediatly. After he will be asked if he want to remove a contract and then the program stats all over, until the user finishes his jobadding contracts.p  pI would be glad to hear some opinions.p  pI am sorry for my English if I am not understandable. p  precodeimport java.util.Arrays  import java.io.BufferedReader import java.io.IOException import java.io.InputStreamReader  public class Main lt T gt       private Object[] myList     public static int actSize  0      public Mainint s              myList  new Object[s]           public T Arrayint i              SuppressWarningsunchecked         final T t  T myList[i]         return t           public void addT object end              if myList.length  actSize lt 5                      myList  Arrays.copyOfmyList, myList.length  2             System.out.printlnnNew length   myList.length                   myList[actSize]  object           public void addT object, int position end              myList[position]  object           public boolean removeT object end              if myList[actSize].equalsobject                      myList[actSize]  myList[actSize  1]             return true                  else             return false           public void removeint position end              myList[position]  myList[position  1]           SuppressWarningsunchecked     public T getint index end              if index lt actSize                      return T myList[index]                  else                      throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException                    public boolean containsT object end              if myList[actSize].equalsobject                      return false                  else             myList[actSize]  myList[actSize  1]          return true           public int size end              return actSize            SuppressWarningsunchecked     public static void mainString[] args              SuppressWarningsrawtypes         Main ob  new MainactSize         String str, str1, str2          try                      BufferedReader br  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderSystem. in               while true                              System.out.printDo you want to add a contact press any key to continue or n to exit                  String str5  br.readLine                  if n.equalsIgnoreCasestr5                                      System.exit1                                   System.out.printEnter your First Name                  str  br.readLine                  System.out.printEnter your Last Name                  str1  br.readLine                  System.out.printEnter your Phone Number                  str2  br.readLine                  ob.addstr  str1  str2                 ob.addstr  str1  str2, actSize                  if ob.containsstr  str1  str2  true                                      System.out.printlnThe contact you entered is duplicated                     ob.removeob.containsstr  str1  str2                     System.out.printlnThe contact has been removed                                   System.out.printDo you want to add contracts press y to continue                  String str3  br.readLine                 System.out.printlnYou just entered  str3                  if y.equalsIgnoreCasestr3                                      System.out.printWhich contract do you wish to be removed                     String str4  br.readLine                      if str4.equalsactSize                                              ob.removeactSize                         System.out.printlnThe contact has been deleted.                                                                     catch IOException e                      e.printStackTrace                 codepre

Negative 45162 pI have a WebView Im loading with an image.  Theres a small static footer at the bottom, so the WebView does not take up the entire screen height.  The image is never taller than it is wider, so when in portrait mode, the image loads into the WebView fine, being sized so that there is no need to scroll.  But when in landscape orientation, the image height extends way beyond the WebView height, and requires the user to scroll. I should mention I am controlling the orientation in code, based on user setting, at activity start, and I have modified the manifest.xml to prevent activity restart on screen orientation change.p  pHow can I get the image to fit in the WebView heightwise as well as the width, for both portrait and landscape, so that by default the user doesnt have to scroll I dont have access to modify the html either.p  pCurrently Im using p  precodewebview.getSettings.setBuiltInZoomControlstrue  webview.getSettings.setUseWideViewPorttrue  webview.getSettings.setLoadWithOverviewModetrue codepre

Negative 45162 pOk so I have tried implementing simple mono alphabetic substitution ciphers like Caesars , digraph like playfair , polyalphabetic ones  like autokey, vigenre and a few others in c without using classes. Now i would like to bring together all these ciphers and a few others and package it into a single project.I have started coding a few lines, but im not sure how i must design it. Heres how my classes look.p  pmy front end      main.cpp contains few switch cases to chose the right cipher for encryption.p  precodecipher.cpp implements class cipher.In a crude format the class looks like class cipher  protected string plaintxt,ciphertxt public virtual bool encrypt0 virtual bool decrypt0 virtual bool tabulate0  this class is interfaced by cipher.h  monoalphabetic.cpp implemants the class monoalpha  class monoalpha  public cipher   protected  mapltstring,stringgt Etable,Dtable  public  bool Encrypt bool Decrypt  codepre  pNow im using a simple example of atbash cipher here.For those of you who dont know what an atbash cipher is, it is a mode of encryption in which each character in a given string is encrypted with its equivalent character as per position in the reverse alphabetic order. For eg. A Z   ZA   BY  MN  so on.p  precodeclass atbash  public monoalpha    public   bool tabulate   makes a hash map were A is mapped to Z M to N e.t.c atbashstringamp   accepts a string and copies it to string plaintxt.    codepre  pThis is a very crude example. Only the class design is presented here.Here are a few doubts of mine.p  pimplemantation  I would accepts a string from the user and then pass it to the constructor of class atbash, where it is copied to the string data member plaintxt inherited from the base class cipher. Then i would invoke the function tabulate from the constructor.Now i have two choices either tabulate generates a hash map of encryption table and store it in Etable, or it could also generate the decryption table.In the case of an atbash cipher these are one but the same. But what about the case of a general mono alphabetic substitution cipher  how would i force the tabulate functio to create either one.   my idea was to pass a character argument to the constructor to the constructor which describes if the given string is to be encrypted or decrypted and accordingly saves it in either one among plaintxt or ciphertxt.Further the constructor passes this character argument to tabulate function which tabulates the encryption or decryption table accordingly.Is this good p  precodeany suggestion on how to improve this  codepre  pinterface  my way of implementing an interface to all these ciphers from main.cpp was to use swith case like.p  precodeswitchchosenvalue  case 1 coutltltatbash encryption cipherptr  new atbash a string   ptrgttabulate   if it isnt being called directly from the constructor.here it is  case 2 coutltlt caesers cipher  ..................... .  .....       codepre  blockquote   pAre there any better ways to implement this without using switch case.p      palso as you can see i have used a base class pointer to an object of the derived class for doing this.I know it isnt necessary here and the I can simply proceed  by declaring an object. Is there any real importance to referencing objects through a base class pointer    I have heard that these base class pointers can be a real life savior sometimes  If so please direct me on scenarios where this simplifies coding . Is declaring pure virtual functions in the base class not of any use in this particular case.Is it just bloating the code here p      pshould i go on with separating the class implementations into separate files like i have done here or should i just cramp up all these code in a single main.cpp which would make inheritance a lot easier as you dont have to use header files.p      pPlease guide me on this.I have zero professional experience in coding and would love to here your opinions.p blockquote

Negative 45162 pIn our database we have several code tables that we use for referential integrity ex emailTypes, phoneTypes, countryCodes, stateCodes. In our application we load and cache these tables into generic lists. Right now the application has custom ValidationAttributes for each list to see if the value submitted is in a hard coded list of values. I believe that this could be rewritten with a new custom validationAttribute that takes in a generic list, the property to search for the value and the datatype of the value and returns valid if the value exists in the list.p  pFirst I am wondering if I could even use a compile time list that is populated at runtime in a custom validationattribute.p  pIf so, has anyone come up with a good solution for this already If not, is there a work a good work aroundp  pI will include bonus points not that stackoverflow has bonus points if you include IClientValidatable for js validation.p
Negative 45162 pGiven a target URI, how can I programmatically determine whether an HTTP GET of that URI would be making a request to the local machinep  pstrongContextstrong There are two reasons I need to do this.  One is that I have a modperl2 application that responds to HTTP requests. In doing so, it sometimes needs to make an HTTP request to retrieve some data from a target URI. To avoid an infinite recursion of HTTP requests, I need to avoid making the HTTP request if the target URI would actually resolve to the current machine. This is to prevent users from accidentally shooting themselves in the foot. It is not intended as a security check.  p  pThe second reason is that, if my application receives an HTTP request, I need to look up some metadata using the request URI as key.  The problem is that any of several URI synonyms could have been used as keys in creating the metadata, so I need a way to resolve the synonyms, but only for URIs on the local host machine.p  pThe problem is not as simple as looking at the URI to see if the domain is localhost, or its IP address is 127.0.0.1 or 127.0.1.1 or 127., because a the target URI might use a fully qualified domain name e.g., foo.example.com that resolves to an IP address on the current machine and b a machine can have several IP addresses.p  pThe OS emmustem have the information needed to figure this out, since it has to know the IP addresses and ports on which it listens.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions330458howcanideterminethelocalmachinesipaddressesfromperl12354223This posta discusses the problem of trying to determine the local machines IP address or addresses, since it may have several. Maybe I could do that to determine the local machines IP addresses, and then perhaps I could compare those IP addresses against the IP address in the target URI or the IP address returned by gethostbyname of the URIs domain. Do I really need to do that Are there problems with that approach Is there a better way  p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11834091howtocheckiflocalhostcomment19032947This posta indicates that C has a function HttpContext.Current.Request.IsLocal to do what I need, but I have been unable to find anything similar in perl.p  pI previously a hrefhttpwww.perlmonks.orgnodeid1084201 relnofollowasked this questiona on perlmonks.org because Im using perl but found no satisfactory answer. If there is a solution available in some other programming language that is commonly available on Linux, such as C, bash or python, that would be adequate also.  I do not need a solution that is guaranteed to work in every possible case, but it would be nice if it would work for most cases.p

Negative 45162 pI have a UITableView in a UIViewController which is inside a UINavigationController which is inside a UITabBarController.p  pWhen Developing using a 3.5 Simulator and having my storyboard set to 3.5 and everything works fine.p  pHowever if I use a 4 simulator, the UITableView ends too short up the screen. And if I do it the other way around the table view ends off the bottom of the screen.p  pHow do I go about correctly sizing my UITableViewp  pP.S. Im not sure it matters, but Im loading an AdBannerView which goes at the bottom of the screen, so Im adjusting the contentInset of the UITableView after it is loaded to make space for the AdBannerView, but I dont think that makes a difference to this situation.p
Negative 45162 pFor a couple of reasons, Im interested in writing a hybrid application which is partially coded in Java via Google Web Toolkit and partially coded in JavaScript. Im planning on calling the Java library from JavaScript by using a hrefhttpscode.google.compgwtexporter relnofollowGWT Exportera.p  pThe trouble is that this destroys a lot of the opportunities for code optimization and compression. GWT is mostly just designed to optimize the JavaScript it generates, and thirdparty Javascript compression libraries will probably break down when given GWT output.p  pIs there a way to tell the GWT compiler hey, pass these Javascript files into your optimization pass as well GWT has a flag for using the Closure Compiler under the hood which obviously supports optimizing regular javascript, so it feels like this should be possible.p

Negative 45162 pIm very new to C so Im somewhat confused about how static arrays work.  I know in C the array isnt placed into memory until its first accessed which can be problematic if you want it to be instantly accessible.  However, Im working on converting a Perlin class to C and Id like to have multiple static arrays of which only one may be used during runtime or any number of them.  In reality, its not really that big of a memory issue as none of them will be more than 50kb, however, Id rather know if its possible to ensure the array isnt loaded into memory unless I ask for it. Is there a way to ensure a static array defined in source code isnt loaded into memory unless asked for  Its a pretty nitpicky thing esp w x64, but Id prefer to be as optimized about it as possible.  I hate the idea of taking up memory with something that isnt going to be used.p  pOr maybe static arrays arent even the way to go  just dynamical class object wrapped arrays  p  pI guess the real question is what is the most efficient solution for implementing tablelookups in c that might not all be usedp
Negative 45162 pIm using codegloballinummode tcode to present line numbers in Emacs. This works just fine upuntil I use the kbdctrlkbd  kbdupkbdkbddownkbd commands codeforwardparagraphcode and codebackwardparagraphcode to navigate a buffer, at which point some line numbers are rendered incorrectly see attached image. This occurs only when I use said commands to skip entire segments of code, and the issue immediately disappears the line numbers are rendered correctly, that is if I start navigating the buffer by other means. The issue is present in both C and C modes visualized, and Im using Emacs 24.3.1 on x8664 Fedora 19.p  pWhile the gotoline command serves my purposes in terms of navigating compilation errors and warnings, Id like to keep the line numbers as I find them to be helpful in terms of quickly approximating length of functions. So far Ive found no mention of this problem elsewhere, and Im unsure of whether or not this is expected behavior of Emacs or if Im to submit a bug report.p  pHas anyone encountered the issue or know anything of its originp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRm63T.png altenter image description herep  hr  pFixp  pThe problem may be resolved by invoking codelinumupdatecurrentcode, as portrayed by lawlist in his answer below.

Negative 45162 pThe machine on which I develop has more memory than the one on which the code will eventually run. I dont have access tothe machine on which it will actually run. This is a 64 bit application and I intend to use the address space but cap physical allocation. I dont want to lock down virtual memory, only physical memory. Is there a way to set limits on a linux machine such that it mimics a system with low RAM. I think codeulimitcode does not differentiate between reserved address space vs actual allocation. If there is a way to do it without rebooting with different kernel parameters or, pulling out extra RAM that would be great. May be some proc tricks.p

Negative 45162 pI am working on developing a web site that dynamically creates a table and highlights prime numbers for the user at a hrefhttpwww.primenumbertable.com relnofollowhttpwww.primenumbertable.coma. I thought I had the computational flow mapped out properly, but after I included the ability for the user to include a starting point, something fell apart.p  pInstead of computing tables to the range specified, tables sometimes get cut short. For instance, if the user specifies that they want to check 100 numbers, and have a starting point of 1, the table will only generate numbers 19, instead of 1100.p  pI even broke out a pen and pad and tried to do the computations stepbystep myself, to see where the error was coming, but my pen and pad calculations had no computational anomalies.p  pIt seemed to me that the value that was being input was somehow getting the last 0 cut off before going into the table, but i couldnt find how that was happening. Then, I thought that this could not be the problem, because when i try to check 99 numbers, I get a table that goes all the way up to 102p  pSo, I really have two questions 1  How do I trace where the computational error is being made, and 2  Can anyone see a fix for what is going wrongp  pThe following is my source codep  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtml langengt lt This page asks the user to input

Negative 45162 pIn question [1] I read that NFC tags do not have to be in NDEF format if you want to use them under Android. I would like to perform this under Win 8.1 in .Net. My situation is like thisp  pI have an RFID card Mifare Classic 1K with an ID stored in it. recorded by manufacturer This ID is read by our attendancesystem by usual RFID reader for example PROMAG MFR120 by Gigatek We do not write anything to the card, we just need to read the ID. But we need to read it also by NFC reader and here is the problem.p  pOur cards Mifare Classic 1K are not formatted in NDEF format so they are invisible for NFC reader by Broadcom. NFC reader only knows that a card has arrived  departed .NET events DeviceArrived, DeviceDeparted are fired but no message arrives, because our NFC reader cannot communicate with Mifare card in current state. At least Broadcom reader cannot. NXP reader should be compatible, but I dont have such a device. Am I rightp  pTherefore I would like to read the card manually on a low level, not by .NET class Proximity which is probably designed only for NDEF formated cards. I expect that if I read the card manually, I could read all data in binary, byte or string format and parse it my way. p  pIs this possible in .NET or do I have to reformat Mifare card to NDEF I am afraid that it will stop working with current readers.p  pThanks for comments and ides in advance ...p  pPS My equipment is Lenovo ThinkPad 10  Win 8.1  Broadcom NFC reader integrated in the tablet.p  p[1] Question about NDEF under Android a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8771424donfctagshavetobendefformatedDo NFC tags have to be NDEF formatedap

Most of the fields seem used to actually parseread emails. The only field which makes sense at some degree for the send method is Payload of type  a hrefhttpgodoc.orgcode.google.compgoogleapigoclientgmailv1MessagePart relnofollowMessageParta  though I cant figure it out how to generate the MessagePartBody as it seems to be a kind of mime type.

It requires an codeuploadTypecode param WTF to upload and a coderawcode field which I guess is the raw message which  requires a format provided by messages.get. Why would you send a message from your inbox which literally would be a resend as your are on the receipt list  Am I the only one who thinks this APIor at least the documentation is just crap p

Negative 45162 pIm working with an OpenCL kernel where I need to use associated Legendre polynomials. p  pThese are a set of fairly difficult to compute polynomials indexed by a integer n and m orders, and accepting a real argument. The specifics of the actual polynomials is irrelevant, since I have a slow hostside function that can generate them, but the kernel side function would need to look something likep  precodefloat legendreint n, int m, float z       float3 lookupCoords     lookupCoords.x  n     lookupCoords.y  m     lookupCoords.z  z      Do something here to interpolate Z for a given N and M...   codepre  pI want to interpolate along the Z axis, but just have nearest neighbor for the n and m axes since theyre only defined for integer values. A benefit of Z is that its only defined between 1 and 1, so it already looks a lot like a texture coordinate.p  pstrongHow can I accomplish this with a sampler and lookup tables in OpenCLstrongp  pMy first thought was to attempt to use a 3D texture filled with precomputed orders, but I only want to interpolate along one dimension the real or Z argument, and Im not sure what this would look like in OpenCL C.p

Negative 45162 pGiven a 40x30 array of colors what would be the fastest way to display them on the screen in a 400x300 canvas That is, each color would require 100 pixels in the canvas element.p  pUsing the canvas element in HTML5 I created 4 possible ways to do it. a hrefhttpjsperf.compixelplotting relnofollowhttpjsperf.compixelplottingap  pRandom pixel data is loaded into the 40x30 array.

Negative 45162 pso this is the issuep  pI have a TFS 2012 installed on a server A and I want to install a TFS Build Service on server B. The TFS on server A has a DefaultCollection which I want to link it to a Team Build. When I try to configure the build server it shows a failure message User1 needs ManageBuildResources permission set to allowed. User1 is NOT in any group, its a single lonely user, then I ask a coworker about the permissions. Now in the security settings of Team Explorer it shows that User1 has ManageBuildResources set to allowed on DefaultCollection. Still, when I try to configure it, it shows again the same failure message.p  pSo I read in the Microsoft website that User1 must be in Project Collection Administrators group in order to configure a build server, do I need to make User1 a member of this group, even if User1 has all the privileges Because I dont understand why it shows that User1 doesnt have privileges.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 45162 pI have a collection of documents in mongodb and I want to compute the CDF for some of the attributes and return or store it in the db.

Negative 45162 pI host multiple servers for multiplayer games and I am requiring some help with creating a PHP MySQL script.  I have made scripts for the game servers that output a few variables to a php script. These variables include the player name, a GUID number Game User ID and a couple other unimportant things. These are sent to the php script every time a player joins the server. p  pAnyway what I basically need it to do is every time a player joins the server it saves the player name, guid and join datetimestamp to a row in a MySQL table. The player will always have only one GUID code, which is sort of like their cdkey. What I have at this current time p  precodeif  action  save  name  mysqlrealescapestringGET[name] guid  mysqlrealescapestringGET[guid]     mysqlqueryINSERT INTO players name, guid VALUES name, guid ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE lastjoinedCURRENTTIMESTAMPor diemysqlerror    echo 10 die codepre  pNow, this works great as it is. But what I need it to do is if the player comes on the server with a different name, it will log that instance into a new row and if they come on again with the same name it will update the same row with the current time stamp. And for instance, if they change their name back to the first name they use it will update the row that has that name recorded with the current time stamp.  p  pThe only thing I have tried is making the name column, a primary key and on a duplicate entry it would update it. However if I did that and another player came on the server with the same name it would just update the last players data. p  pSo it needs to record every username a player uses.p  pTheres probably quite a simple solution but Ive never had the time to learn to MySQL and I need this done soon. p  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 45162 pI have a specific question regarding the location of the hibernateannotations jar in my maven project. p  pMy project consists of three modules. The modules Client and Server are both depending on the module Shared. Maven builds two packages for deployment Client  Shared and Server  Shared.p  pAnnotated Hibernate entities are located in the Shared module since I need to pass them between the client and the server via RMI.p  pNow comes my problem. The hibernateannotations.jar is used as dependency of the Shared module to allow compilation of the Hibernate entities. The library itself depends on hibernatecore. As result, I have the hibernate libraries in my deployed client application, even if I dont really need them there. The jars are quite big and I want to keep the client as slim as possible. p  pAre there some established techniques to avoid this problem One that comes to mind would be to use XML based Hibernate configuration so I could move the Hibernate dependencies to the Server module, but I would like to stick to annotations.p  pThanks.p

Negative 45162 pstrongContextstrongp  pI write an ORM that stores an object graph into postgre for ObjectiveCloud. Well, thats, what an ORM does. p  pstrongSituationstrongp  pThe object graph is not loaded completely, but incrementally. That leads to the situation that when a fetch codeSELECTcode is done, resulting rows can already be in memory and be changed. Beside this, I have to unique them for some reasons, even if they did not change. I handle this by throwing away the already loaded rows.p  pThat can be done very easily, when the rows to be fetched are addresses with their PK, because I know all already loaded PK and can subtract them from the set of PKs to load.p  precoderowsToLoad  rowsRequested  loadedRows codepre  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pIf the rows to be fetched are addressed by a predicate, there are two strategiesp  ol lipFetch all rows completely that matches the predicate and then remove the rows that are already loaded.pli lipFetch only the PKs of the rows, that matches the predicate, remove the rows that are already loaded and then fetch the columns of the remaining rows.pli ol  pOf course I have to add the matching rows already loaded into memory for both strategies.p  pIt is obvious that the better strategy depends of the probability of a collision and the number of columns.

I should note that I dont consider this a duplicate, since that question was asking for a solution to a specific problem. I am asking for more information about the behavior in general here, and demonstrating how it can be reproduced. To demonstrate the difference, you can see a fairly long comment thread on the accepted answer where we discussed the behavior, and I felt it was getting off topic, especially given the length.p  pI have a function. Heres a sample one that exhibits the behavior of interestp  precodeCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION testINT   RETURNS TABLEnum INT, letter TEXT   VOLATILE   LANGUAGE SQL   AS    SELECT    FROM VALUES 1,a,2,b,3,c,4,d,5,e x   LIMIT 1    codepre  pWhen I run this codeEXPLAINcodep  precodeEXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT  FROM test10 codepre  pI get this result in psql where Ive removed a giant Query Plan headerp  precode Function Scan on test  cost0.25..10.25 rows1000 width36 actual time0.125..0.136 rows5 loops1  Total runtime 0.179 ms 2 rows codepre  pTake note of the row estimation.

The cost is an order of magnitude higher. The runtime went down as well. The query is so short, that might not be especially significant.p  pIn light of the linked question dealing with much more data and having a very significant performance difference, it would seem that the planner is actually doing something different based on whether the function is codeVOLATILEcode or codeSTABLEcodecodeIMMUTABLEcode.p  pWhat exactly is the planner doing here, and where can I read some documentation on itp  pThese tests were run in PG 9.3.p

Negative 45162 pIn my setup exemplified below, I didnt notice until recently that when the list of elements listed in the expander grows so that the length of it exceeds the length of the buttons in the panel next to it, it doesnt hover over the data grid, as intuitively expected.

I am trying to make a converter to learn this but was wondering how its possible to have it so when the user highlights a unit from the one table and a unit from the another table it takes the number the user places into an input labeled input and does the appropriate divisionmultiplication depending on units and outputs the conversion result into a text box once a button is clicked.

Negative 45162 pstrongTLDRstrong Trying to render a noncontiguous fuller projection but feature polygons span multiple viewports. How do I avoid that cut polygons at viewport edgesp  pstrongFull versionstrong Id like to render a noncontiguous fuller projection tiles separated by space and not traditionally aligned of geo data. How do I get this to work in D3 An example of the rough layout Im looking for can be a hrefhttparagos.netuploadproductionlayout.svg relnofollowfound herea.p  pI think Ive figured out how to write the projection itself, based on the extremely helpful work by Jason Davis at a hrefhttpjasondavies.commapsairocean relnofollowjasondavies.commapsairoceana. Since I dont want a contiguous map representation I merely hardcode the transformation from gnomonic to relative position for each face rather than doing matrix multiplications for shared tile edges. However, features that cross tile boundaries currently get rendered as a single SVG path, thus causing them to smear all across the canvas connecting the tiles where they are present, as in this a hrefhttparagos.netuploadsmearedpolygons.png relnofollowsimple layout examplea.p  pI noticed that Jason already forked D3 for his fuller projection, adding d3.geo.projection.clipPolygon to render a nonrectangular viewport. But even that logic seems to be limited to a single viewport encompassing the entire map. Looking at clipPolygons implementation Im not sure if I could adapt it to handle multiple polygons in any reasonable amount of time.p  pNote that as I dont plan to publish this as a webpage its the base for a physical layout in an art project  Id be perfectly happy if the render time is long and I had one projection per face and the clip outline just encompassed a single face each. Unfortunately even that seems beyond me right now, if I pass a single tiles outline as clip polygon, I only get that face rendered but completely filled with a single color feature polygon.p  pAny help appreciated  p  pThe polyhedron projection Im usingp  precoded3.geo.woodcut  functionnodes, face    var r    1.5    var baseTransform  [     Math.cosr, Math.sinr, 0,     Math.sinr, Math.cosr, 0   ]    var mesh  [], outline  []    for var i  0 i lt nodes.length i      var node  nodes[i]        var ring  node.face.slice     ring.pushring[0]     var centroid  d3.geo.centroidtype Polygon, coordinates [ring]       add mesh     var edges  faceEdgesnode.face     for var j  0 j lt edges.length j         todo skip some sides for indented triangle       mesh.pushedges[j].mapfunctiond  return d3.geo.interpolated, centroid             add to outline     if i  4true        var tmp  node.face.slice       tmp.pushtmp[0]       for var j  0 j lt tmp.length j          outline.pushtmp.mapfunctiond  return d3.geo.interpolated, centroid                   node.transform  baseTransform.slice     node.transform[2]  i  1.5       function forward,       var node  face, ,         point  node.project[  degrees,   degrees],         t     if t  node.transform        return [         t[0]  point[0]  t[1]  point[1]  t[2],         t[3]  point[0]  t[4]  point[1]  t[5]       ]          point[1]  point[1]     return point       var projection  d3.geo.projectionforward.clipPolygonoutline   projection.mesh  mesh    return projection  codepre

Negative 45162 pIm building an app that utilizes Soundcloud API and we came across a small problem. We archive playlists on our own servers to cut down on the amount of data needed to display tracks. So, for example, a user can create a playlist with tracks from soundcloud but we strip away the data provided by soundcloud to the minimum required to view and play said track. This data includes its SCID, track name, artist, stream URL, etc. But doesnt provide the full data set SC does. p  pMy questionp  pWhen songs are removed due to DMCA Copyright infringement, does SoundCloud keep the track ID and information available or does it remove the track entirely What I mean by this is, say I have a track with ID 123456 and it was removed due to DMCA. Does this track still exist such that I could GET request [SCapiurl]tracks123456.json which would yield the track but it would not be streamable nor downloadable p  pCorrect my logic if I am wrong.

Negative 45162 pThe website I am building holds 571 houses with information about each house. Each house has a image associated with it. The information is coming from a SQL database table called houses. I am using a custom pager to filter the 571 houses with 5 results per page. I am using a repeater control to do this so I dont have multiple aspx pages. My question is I want to store the folder with the 571 images in a location stored on a network drive and set a path to the specific image in that folder for each house in the database table column called image and display the images for each house while using the repeater control. I have looked at a lot of tutorials but nothing is helping me. Please dont post any links to tutorials because I have looked at them all. If you have done anything like this before please post your experience because this is new to me.

Negative 45162 pSo Im implementing audio Playlist app that imports audios from Parse.com, and when I retrieve them by streaming them directly from their URls, it took maybe one minute to play after clicking play button.

Currently, before I insert into the table, I check to see if the record already exists, then do the insert if its not there, it takes a little longer because I do not have a primary key setup. Ill also need to search on the table to get values. p  pShould I use a composite primary key using all fieldsp  pThis table will not relate to other tables in any way. Thanks for your input.  Bryanp

Db1 contains two codecolumncodes, codeidcode and codePriceMincode.p  hr  pcodeDb2code contains columns codeidcode and codePricecode.p  hr  pcodeDb1code is the mother database in which each codeidcode contains a set price. This codedbcode is static. p  hr  pcodeDb2code is the child database in which people strongvotestrong for each item  read codeidcode  and a script uses the codeavgcode  function after matching ids and prices to show data.p  hr  pNow, since this is a script which asks for votes, it has a huge flaw it can be manipulated. So Im trying to have a script run every couple of hours which goes through codedb2code, matches the codeidcode and deletes each row vote from codedb2code which has a id and its price is over 200 of the same codeidcode in codedb1code.p  hr  pMy solutions up to nowp  ol lipHave each db be queried and fetched into an array and use codestrreplacecode via using an codeifcode function.
