Positive 8945 pI have been trying to figure this one out for a bit, not coming up with the right approach.  I read through a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28243315attachjavafileassourceforjarinintellijthis questiona, which Id already tried, but its not working quite right.. using IntelliJ EAP 142.4675.3p  pWhat I am trying to do, is to debug a junit test using a jar extending the Provider class file Ive placed into JAVAHOMEjrelibext. I want that jar to be debuggable as well.p  pThe problem is, if I attach my source directory as the source for a jar, then, in a stack trace, when I click the named file containing a method I wish to view, IntelliJ asks me to choose between two of the same file, presumably because it knows about the source its in a module in my project and its also been told about the source via the jar source path I added.p  pI tried adding the provider.jar to the project module dependencies tab, which caused intellij no end of grief.  Reverted back to having it in jrelibext, and, in the Platform SettingsSDKs1.8Sourcepath tab, I added the module sourcepath.  This lets intellij step into the .java file for the jar, vs the .class file, but, when it does so, I now get a banner at the top of my code windows which says Alternative source available for the class xxx and theres a combobox at the RHS with the module name listed twice in the latest EAP, it actually lists the module and the jar [same name as module, with .jar].  And, as mentioned earlier, the IDE asks which which of the very same file I wish to edit when I click a file in the stack trace.p  pClearly, there is something not quite right.. what am I missing  I find it odd that the ide will not open the source code when stepping into the jar until I attach the code as above, but, when I do, it sees it twice.p

Positive 8945 pI have recently started using Intellij and I noticed that by default, when you do ctrlc for copying something when you have nothing selected, it copies the entire line into the clipboard overriding what I had in there before.p  pThis is really annoying yet I cannot seem to figure out how to disable it. I am aware that there is a paste history you can use however this is not what I am after, I just want to disable it like you can do with sublime text.p  pIs there a way to disable this behaviour so that when I press ctrlc and nothing is selected it just leaves the clipboard alonep
Positive 8945 pIf I wanted to use just the normal git via the command line and not the one in IntelliJ, what do I need to include in the version control so when I download it, I can get the Maven libraries without manually installing themp  pEdit There is no pom.xml file when the libraries are added to an IntelliJ project, so I was wondering what I need to include so Maven inside IntelliJ can download the libraries.p
Positive 8945 pIm using an annotation processor to generate a source file.  This works, the class gets added in targetclasses and I can import it and use it as expected.p  pIts kind of annoying though because everywhere I use that source file intellij highlights it as red because it doesnt know about it.p  pIs it possible to somehow add that generated file somewhere that intellij knows about it and can use it to autocomplete things  I realize the file would potentially be slightly dated because it might change the next time the annotation processor is invoked, but Im okay with that because it is fairly static.  I could also copy the file to my main src directory but that doesnt seem very DRY.p

Negative 8945 pIve got a website that has a form that the user can type in. I want it to be the replacement for a 3rd party website Autotask form with the same fields. Normally Id just have the action in my form go to where the 3rd partys form points and then have all the same idname values for my own fields, but there are several problems with thisp  pAutotasks forms arent just simple mulifield forms. They import at least 15 Javascripts that make something magic and unidentifiable happen, and they are incredibly difficult to read and understand. So that causes two problems, one that the form takes a very long time to load 5 seconds or so for 4 fields, and two is that if Autotask changes anything at all Ill need to redo the whole form very tedious and crapshooty, and I already have needed to do it twice.p  pIn order to make the load time more transparent, I put my copy of the Autotask form within an iFrame. That way the rest of the website can load separately from the expensive number of scripts Ive got to include with Autotasks logon process.p  pIdeally what I want to be able to do is to just have those 4 fields on my site with whatever name and configuration I want, then send that POST data to my own PHP script, which will automatically and transparently submit that data directly through Autotasks forms in the proper fields. If I need to make the idname match, thats okay. I can use HTML, Javascript, and PHP on this site.p  pEDIT Autotask has builtin GET handlers for their logins. Youll notice that you have a client ID at the login it will be the ci variable in the URL. If you send a GET request with the client ID there and variables for username and password, then it Autotasks login page will immediately forward you to the client page, given a successful login.p

Negative 8945 pIm trying to write a program that will detect signs of failure for portable flash memory devices thumb drives, etc.p  pI have seen tools in the past that are able to detect failing sectors and other kinds of trouble on conventional mechanical hard drives, but I fear that flash memory does not have the same kind of predictable lowlevel access to the hardware due to the internal workings of the storage. Things like wearleveling and other blockremapping techniques to skip over dead sectors lead me to believe that determining if a flash drive is failing will be difficult at best, if not impossible short of having constant read failures and device unmounts.p  pFlash drives at their endoflife should be easy to detect constant CRC discrepancies during reads and allout failure.

Negative 8945 pLets say I have an encrypted file on an iPhone and every time I want to decrypt it, I want to draw a decryption symbol instead of having to use a keyboard to type it in.p  pIf you request from the user to draw a symbol to decrypt a file every time it is needed e.g. every time they launch your application they would probably prefer it to having to type a 20 character or so password on the tiny keyboard, and they would still get the security a 20 character password would give them depending on how complicated the shapesymbol they draw is.p  pThe symbol they would draw would most likely be one stroke e.g. its over once you lift up your finger but can be very complex, such that its hard for someone else to repeat it, even if they do see you draw it in. Kind of like how every persons signature is unique and hard to duplicate. Actually, this may just overly complicate it if it had to prevent from being duplicated, so for now this can be ignored and we can assume that the symbol will not be seen by someone else and thus it doesnt matter if it could be repeated by them or not.p  pI guess the real question is how would you convert the same reasonably stroke consistently to the same key e.g. hash value. There should obviously be some threshold of forgiveness in the algorithm, because the user cant be expected to repeat the stroke exactly 100.p  pUsing the symbol as a decryption method adds a whole other dimension to this problem. You never want to store the generated hash value anywhere in unencrypted form, cause then someone might be able to access that part of the hard drive and get the decryption key without needing to go through the whole drawing process and decrypt the file manually. You also most likely dont want to store anything about how the shape is drawn.p  pA good example of a stroke that a user might use as their decryption symbol is the amp symbol. Imagine a user drawing this symbol on their iPhone every time they need to decrypt a file. The size of the symbol might not be the same every time it is drawn. Also, the rotation of the symbol may be different depending on how the user holds their device. Ideally, in both cases, because the symbol was drawn, relative to the user strokes, the same, it should be able to generate the same hash value and thus decrypt the file.p  pI thought something like shape or character recognition is a similar algorithm. Where the user draws something reasonably representing a shape and it then fixes it to the correct shape which would have the same hash value every time it is drawn. However, for something like this you would most likely need a database of shapes that can be drawn, and if you choose something like all the letters in the alphabet, you only get 26 letters. And assuming the user should only need to draw one symbol to decrypt the file, you have an extremely insecure password with only 26 possibilities.p  pAnother thing I thought of is you could break up the symbol that is drawn into tiny segments and then run symbol recognition on those. So imagine that you have 4 symbols in a database vertical line, horizontal line, and diagonal in both directions. Now as the user draws, each segment is recognized as one of these, and then they are all combined to form some hash value. So imagine the user chose as their decryption symbol the lowercase letter r. So they would begin by drawing a vertical line down, followed by a vertical line up, followed by a diagonal line up and to the right. One problem with this method is how would you know when to split up the stroke into individual segments You would probably also want to take into account how long each individual segment is roughly e.g. in increments of 40 pixels. That way if someone drew a deformed r where the hump comes out near the bottom it isnt recognized as the same symbol and thus wouldnt decrypt the file.p  pA third method might be dividing the screen up into a grid not sure which size yet and simply seeing in which cells the stroke is drawn and using this data somehow to generate a string.p  pAny other ideas of how this could be implemented Have you ever heard of something like this Are there any fundamental flaws that would prevent a system like this from workingp  pThanksp

Negative 8945 pAn example for the sake of the question I have a database which contains users, questions, and answers.

Negative 8945 pI have a Rails project that is basically a simple web app for a membershipbased organization. Weve open sourced the a hrefhttpgithub.comrubygorgecrgta relnofollowcode on Githuba for the web app so that others can use it, but have a licensed designlayout that the original organization is going to use. This layout cannot be open sourced. I was wondering if others have run into the situation where you have an opensource Rails app with a nonOS design.p  pMy initial thought is to put appviews in .gitignore, and to have anyone forking the code add their own views directory, perhaps including an appviewsdefault directory with a webapptheme layout or something else to get people running. Is this the best option realizing that there are other files such as JavaScript, CSS, etc that come with the layout that must also be ignored.p  pDoes anyone have some good thoughts or pointers on thisp

Negative 8945 pWhat would be the best approach to compare two hexadecimal file signatures against each other for similarities. p  pMore specifically, what I would like to do is to take the hexadecimal representation of an .exe file and compare it against a series of virus signature. For this approach I plan to break the file exe hex representation into individual groups of N chars ie. 10 hex chars and do the same with the virus signature. I am aiming to perform some sort of heuristics and therefore statistically check whether this exe file has X of similarity against the known virus signature.p  pThe simplest and likely very wrong way I thought of doing this is, to compare exe[n, n1] against virus [n, n1] where each element in the array is a sub array, and therefore exe1[0,9] against virus1[0,9]. Each subset will be graded statistically.p  pAs you can realize there would be a massive number of comparisons and hence very very slow. So I thought to ask whether you guys can think of a better approach to do such comparison, for example implementing different data structures together. p  pemThis is for a project am doing for my BSc where am trying to develop an algorithm to detect polymorphic malware, this is only one part of the whole system, where the other is based on genetic algorithms to evolve the static virus signature. Any advice, comments, or general information such as resources are very welcome.emp  hr  pstrongDefinitionstrong Polymorphic malware virus, worm, ... maintains the same functionality and payload as their original version, while having apparently different structures variants. They achieve that by code obfuscation and thus altering their hex signature. Some of the techniques used for polymorphism are format alteration insert remove blanks, variable renaming, statement rearrangement, junk code addition, statement replacement x1 changes to xy5 where y5, swapping of control statements. So much like the flu virus mutates and therefore vaccination is not effective, polymorphic malware mutates to avoid detection.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong After the advise you guys gave me in regards what reading to do I did that, but it somewhat confused me more.

Negative 8945 pIm looking for guidance on how to architect an elegant solution to what has become a bit of a thorny problem.  Although I am using Ruby and Rails I think my problem is largely an architectural one, though my choice of language obviously has an impact in terms of suggestions involving libraries, etc., so the language remains relevant.p  pAnyway, in a nutshell my application contains objects representing memberships, belonging to people who are members of fitness facilities.  Memberships contain a series of recurring payments.  Some memberships automatically renew at the end of their term, while others do not.p  pSo for example, you may have a membership that is for an initial period of one year, and then renews monthtomonth after that.  In the application, creating a membership of this kind causes 12 recurring payments to be created.  When the last month expires, so does the membership.  A daily cron task is responsible for causing memberships to expire based on completed payments.  If the membership is set to automatically renew, the same cron task will renew the membership.p  pYou may also have memberships that have no initial term and simply run monthtomonth or weektoweek.  These work in a similar manner, minus the initial payment scheduling.p  pSo far so good.  What makes things complicated are the additional requirementsp  ul lipadministrators can freeze memberships put them on hold, for specific durations, after which they automatically reactivate e.g. to represent people who go away on vacation for a set period of time.  I can choose to freeze a membership right now and have it reactivate later, or I can choose to schedule a freeze by setting the freeze date at some point in the future, as well as the reactivation date note there is emalwaysem a reactivation date, which makes things a bit easier.pli lipadministrators can cancel memberships, either right now, or by setting a cancellation to occur in the future.  Future cancellations are not yet built.pli lipadministrators can refund memberships, which is like a cancellation except any past payments are refunded.pli ul  pWhat makes these difficult to deal with is the effect on recurring payments.  When you freeze a membership, the recurring payments must stretch out around the freeze period, so that the period of time that represents the freeze is not paid for.  This is both conceptually and programmatically difficult to handle.  Payments, for example, may extend for different periods i.e. each payment for someone who pays every other week pays for two weeks of a membership, and the date of cancellation may be anywhere within the period the payment covers.p  pFor the freezes, I have taken the approach where the membership object contains some dates, namely freezeon and thawon to handle the freeze period.  However, the client now wants future cancellations as well, and I have noticed some bugs with the freezing functionality, which leads me to believe I need to reconsider my approach.p  pI am considering changing things so that future events can be scheduled but have no effect on the recurring payments portion of the application.  The idea would be to queue up particular events.  For example, a freeze in the future would be accomplished by queuing up a freeze event on a particular date, and a thaw event on a subsequent date these two events would be connected into a single scheduled freeze from the users perspective.  A future cancellation would be handled similarly.p  pThis approach has some benefits, for example, if you wanted to cancel a future cancellation thats the kind of annoying, tricky stuff Im talking about, you could simply remove the scheduled cancellation from the events queue.p  pHowever, I have the nagging feeling that I may simply be jumping from the frying pan into the fire.  Im wondering if anyone could provide me with some guidance on this issue.  Are there design patterns or existing architectural principles for this sort of problem that I can examinep  pAn additional thing to note is that recurring payments for memberships with scheduled terms i.e. not monthtomonth automatically renewing must exist as database records that can be edited moved in time, price adjusted, so using temporal expressions as Martin Fowler suggests is not appropriate for this problem, so far as I know.  I realize that my proposed solution of an events queue would not display to the user the changes that would happen to any existing recurring payments, but I think I can live with that.p  pnot a scanlife bar code, its a qr codep  ptoronto, give us your creative peoplep  pstrongEditstrong To respond to the two great suggestions below the comment boxes dont allow nearly this level of detailp  pstrongKris Robisonstrongp  ol lipYes, the freeze period can be an arbitrary length, although in practice I imagine it would be rare for it to be less than two weeks.  But any solution should work regardless of the length of the period.pli lipYes, the renewal date changes  it is pushed forward by the length of the freeze.  So if the freeze is two weeks long, it pushes the payment forward by two weeks.  To make things especially tricky, in some businesses, the payments can only be withdrawn on specific dates  for example, some clubs only process payments on the 1st and 15th of each month.  So when dates are pushed around, for these clubs, they have to snap to a particular date.pli ol  pCan you explain in more detail why these rules affect event queuing but not management of subscription paymentsp  pIm interested in your amortization table concept.  Thats basically exactly what I have built already  a yearlong membership with monthly payments creates 12, with weekly it created 52  and each of these have an amount, tax, etc., associated with them, along with a state machine that governs pending, paid, failed, and refunded states.p  pThe part I am struggling with is how this table responds to events.  Right now, if you set a freeze, it affects the table immediately by changing the dates of the payments.  Set a freeze in the middle of the table, and it pushes payments forward.  That sounds effective, but its actually quite complex and hard to manage.  How would your amortization table idea improve this situationp  pstrongArsen7strongp  pThis sounds like the event queue I proposed originally.  It seems obvious to me that youve worked with stuff like this before I was impressed by your error check on the processing date, this is a great idea and one I intend to implement ASAP so Im hoping that you can explain your suggestion in a little more detail.p  pSpecifically, Im wondering how your concept would deal with the recurring payment situation Ive described in my original question, and in the comment that I just left on Kris Robisons answer.  If I have set up a schedule of recurring payments for a given purchase, and a freeze event is scheduled for right in the middle of the payments, would the schedule of payments remain unchanged until the date of the freeze became the current date, at which time the freeze would be instituted and the payments would move forwardp  pThis strikes me as perhaps a great way to simplify my application, but I am wondering how users would perceive it.  How would I indicate to them that the schedule of payments they were looking at when a freeze has been scheduled is no longer an accurate schedule, but will change once the freeze takes placep

Negative 8945 pIll explain my goal first I want the user to query the database, and return rows only if those rows have been updated since their last query. No sense returning data theyd already have. So I created a column called lastupdated, a timestamp type which autoupdates every time any content in the row is updated. This works fine. Now, I want to form the query correctly. The user will have their previous querys timestamp saved, and via php will use it to compare their previous querys time with the time each row has been updated. If the row was updated after their last query, the row should be returned.p  pI made something like this,p  precodeSELECT  FROM users WHERE 20110226 015030 lt lastupdated codepre  pbut its obviously much too simple. I checked the MySQL manual and found this page a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.1endateandtimefunctions.html relnofollowMySQL TimeDate Pagea. Im sure the answer is here, but Ive read through it any nothing really makes sense. I have a timestamp in the same format used by the MySQL timestamp type, but I dont know how I will compare them.

Negative 8945 pI have jQueryTools tab panel on my page. It consists of 3 tabs. At the same time a have a set of corresponding  so to say remote  links somewhere else on the same page. The intention is to have the tabs switch to a corresponding tab upon clicking the remote link. This Im achieving using the api.click method.p  pHowever the behavior has to be differentiated in that clicking on the remote link has to additionally scroll to the tab panel using the scrollTo plugin.p  pIf I globally change the api behavior to thisp  precodetabsapi.onClickfunctione, index     body.scrollTo ul.tabs , 400  codepre  pThe tabs will unnecessarily jump and scroll also when they are already in the comfortable viewing area. If I do the scrollTo outside of the api though, the scroll will never behave properly, because the command occurs in that eyeblink when the tab panes are all hidden and have zero height, and so the tab panel leans against the bottom of the page.p  pSo my idea is to leave the scrollTo stuff in the api, but attach some kind of a flag to the event to tell if the scroll should be performed or not. The question is ss it possible to hook my custom flag to the event generated by the tab pluginp

In order to troubleshoot I am running WireShark to see exactly what is being pushed over the network interface.p  pI have run a WireShark trace and what I see seems to be a full SSLV3 handshake generated from local MSMQ trying to connect to the serverbr brClientServer  Client Hello brServerClient  Server Hello brClientServer  Client Key Exchange, Change Cipher Spec brServerClient  Change Cipher Spec, Encrypted Handshakep  pAfter these messages I was expecting to see a POST message with the client trying to push a message to the server, and some sort of response from the server but there is nothing. All I see between the client and server after the last Change Cipher Spec is a set of [ACK] and [SYN] messages before the next SSLV3 handshake. The specific messages arebr brClientServer  TCP  [FIN, ACK] brServerClient  TCP  [ACK] brServerClient  TCP  [FIN, ACK] brClientServer  TCP  [ACK] brClientServer  TCP  [SYN] brServerClient  TCP  [SYN] brClientServer  TCP  [ACK]p  pThen the handshake is repeated.p  pShould I not expect to see a POST message after the handshake I know that MSMQ does an HTTP POST of the MSMQ messages when sent over HTTP so I was expecting this to show up as application data after the handshake.p  pDo I need to somehow configure WireShark to see these since it is over HTTPS p  pThanksp

Negative 8945 pIm working on creating an administrative interface that allows managing users in groups in Active Directory. p  pI would like to only show groups to the active user if the user actually has the rights to add or remove other users within those groups, but Im not sure at this point, how to determine which people can modify the groups, or whether the current person has access to modify a specific group. p  pI suppose the application can find out after the user tries and we get an access error, but I dont like to use error trapping as a way of determining if some feature is available and I would prefer not to tempt the users with a list of groups they cant control.p  pIf possible, please supply an answer that targets vb.net 3.5 using System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement as that is the environment that I am currently working within.

Table Items has a field with foreign key categoryid.p  pI want the table Categories to be kept tidy. So when no item in Items is of category X in Categories, the category X should be deleted from Categories. How do you establish that. I guessed by using DELETE ON CASCADE, but so far it was only deleting corresponding items from Items when I deleted a categorie from Categories.p  pThanks a lot for helping mep
Negative 8945 pKnowing that css3s border radius doesnt work on img elements in older browsers, Ive added this technique of replacing img elements with divs with the image source as background image. On that div I use the border radius. This works great, but I have received feedback that sometimes users can see this transition happening in a blink.p  pI noticed that I am able to put border radius on img elements now using the latest firefox 6.0.2. Now my question is, how or where can I find information on which versions of which browsers, this new border radius on img elements is in effect already, so I can call the image replacement as an exception instead of on all browsers.p  pThanks Dannyp  pPS i use css3pie, so this exception is helpful for many browsers.p

Negative 8945 pIm somewhat informed with TDD and BDD with RubyRails, but I will eventually need to use some form of testing with my JavaScript code. I use MooTools as a JS framework and I absolutely love how well I can organize and modularize my code with its codebase. But, sometimes, when I add new features to my application, I find that the functionality can easily break from how it worked before.p  pWhen it comes to testing JavaScrtpt code, does the testing itself fall short of user interaction Is it really only to test the ins and outs of method and emulated classes in JavaScript Or is there a UX testing practice where you can write unit tests to see if your applications UX behaviour is performing how it should be Im aware that behaviour is a broad term, but is there anyway that you can organize your JavaScript tests so that whenever you add something new then you can rest somewhat assured that your new code wont break anything from before How is this done with any of the larger web apps out therep

Negative 8945 pI am developing an application that is writing data to a file. Lets assume while it is writing the data we plug off the battery.

That will indicate whether my data are intact but it wont allow me to roll back to a previous state precorrupted one. I would like a method that would be as lightweight as possible, I am already using the CPU too much by readingwriting changes to my storage on every attribute change of a set of thousands.

Negative 8945 pwe would really appreciate some help with issue or if not, some advice on how we can contact the Magento team or any professional in customizing Magento to achieve it.p  pA client we are trying to develop a cart for has some really customized requirements for their cart regarding the payment of orders. Basically, what they need is as followsp  pThe cart needs to have a special payment method which is Net 30 terms. This payment method would not actually capture or process any payment, but it would create the order as a credit to the customer, which would then be paid within 30 days.p  pSo far up until this point we have been able to implement this reasonably well with the Purchase Order Management module found at a hrefhttpwww.emjainteractive.commagentoextensionsmagentopurchaseordermanagementaccountsreceivablesmodule.htmlhttpwww.emjainteractive.commagentoextensionsmagentopurchaseordermanagementaccountsreceivablesmodule.htmlap  pHowever, at this point the client has said that they also want to be able to go into the admin and make payments from the back end on these unpaid orders, and have the cart process those payments and track them for each order. The payments would also be able to be partial payments, so the customer can pay them down over a period of time instead of having to pay all at once.p  pThe Purchase Order module does not let you do this it needs you to handle the payments yourself outside of Magento and then lets you go in and mark them as Paid when youve received the payment. Meanwhile our client wants to handle all the partial payments for each order right on the cart itself.p  pSo basically, the functionality would be like this The cart admin goes into the cart and pulls up an order, the order says 200 still unpaid on this order the admin can then click a Apply payment button, where he or she can then insert an amount, for example 50 and enter the credit card details and have the payment be processed just as if the order was being placed but without creating any  new order. After this, when the same order is viewed again, it would say 150 still unpaid on this order and show the payment information of all payments made on this order so far.p  pFurther, the client wants this functionality not only on the admin end, but they want the customers to be able to log into their account from the front end of the cart and see their own orders with unpaid balances, and apply any partial payments and do all the same things described above on any of the orders from their account page on the front end.p  pWe have looked far and wide for any kind of plugin or module for Magento with this function but we have come up empty. I would appreciate any kind of ideas, modules, quotes, anything, either paid or not paid, that might help us achieve this functionality. We are willing to hire comsultants andor developers for this but do not know where to go or who to approach. Thank you.p

Negative 8945 pHi DB experts out there,p  pwhat do you SQL experts recommend to substitute a couple of MS Access databases by s.th. more modern like JAVA  Oracle or JAVA  mySQL The databases are small, not more than a few thousand records each. so there is no need for performance speed on the DB side. But all of the MS Access stuff has complex forms with colors for information purposes, details, nested subforms and a lot of nested queries. Since MS Access is hard to debug and misses modern development tools as those in Eclipse I think about a redesign of the old stuff. Said with other words, what is the best way to substitute especially forms Is Java Swing a good library to rebuild all the form stuff Or should I stay with the old stuffp

But this very simple codepiece actually took almost 1520 seconds to run on my Android device xperia ray with a 1Ghz processor.p  pSo I tried to find the bottleneck and reduced as many code lines as possible and ended up with the loop itself, which took almost the same time to run.p  precodefor int j  0 j lt 128 j      for int i  0 i lt 1680 i           Double test  Math.random       codepre  pIs it normal for such a device taking so much time in a simple forloop with no difficult operationsp  pIm very new to programming on mobile devices so please excuse if this question may be stupid.p  pUPDATE Got it faster now with some simpler operations.p  pBut back to my main problemp  precodepublic static void filterImageBitmap img, FilterStrategy filter      img.prepareToDraw     int height  img.getHeight     int width  img.getWidth             RGB rgb     for int j  0 j lt height j          for int i  0 i lt width i              rgb  new RGBimg.getPixeli, j             if filter.isBlackrgb                  img.setPixeli, j, 0              else                 img.setPixeli, j, 0xffffffff                   return  codepre  pThe code above is what I really need to run faster on the device. nearly immediate  Do you see any optimizing potential in itp  pRGB is only a class that calculates the red, green and blue value and the filter simply returns true if all three color parts are below 100 or any othe specified value. Already the loop around img.getPixeli,j or setPixel takes 20 or more seconds. Is this such an expensive operationp

Negative 8945 pLet me first explain the setup that I have.p  pMy web application consists of multiple modules which are interlinked in a way that Module 1 uses controllers  services from Module 2 to recreate common functionality and hence remove code redundancy. So simply put, 2 separate web applications with all classes from 1 application included as a jar in the other.p  pNow, the issue that I am facing is due to common URL mappings in the submodule as per the following scenariop  pemController A from Module 1 extends Controller B from Module 2emp  precodepackage com.module1  RequestMappingclient public class A extends B       RequestMappinghello     public void helloWorldNew...          ...          package com.module2  RequestMappinguser public class B       RequestMapping     public void helloWorld...          ...       codepre  pemController C from Module 1 extends Controller D from Module 2emp  precodepackage com.module1  RequestMappingclient public class C extends D       RequestMappinghelloworld     public void helloWorldNew...          ...          package com.module2  RequestMappinghuman public class D       RequestMapping     public void helloWorld...          ...       codepre  pAs you can see, taking Module 2 separately, URLs that have been mapped are codeusercode amp codeclientcode which is legal in every sense. Now when Module 1 comes into the picture, as expected Spring throws an exception saying the URL codeclientcode is already mapped via codeA.helloWorldcode and codeC.helloWorldcode mappings.p  pIs there a way around this Can I ask Spring to simply ignore the methodlevel RequestMappings found in the super class Or is there a way I can hack Spring to ignore  override the mappings just like the rootlevel RequestMappings didp  pAny help will be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks,br Sumitp

Negative 8945 pAfter years of being away from Ruby, Im back fullforce and have just cut my first gem, which includes an executable.

Additionally, Id also like for the startup script to point the executable at configuration in a place like varp  pTo the best of my knowledge, theres no way with rubygems, gemspec, etc., to specify files getting blown out to other parts of your system during install e.g. startup script to etcinit.d, and config to var.

Negative 8945 pAt my company, we have been running into some memory problems lately.  One thing we have done is increased the heap size in JRUN, but now we are noticing some side effects.p  pOne of which is a CFX tag that processes images. When we use it, it cannot load the files we give it sometimes. Our current idea is that in order to process images, the whole image must be loaded into memory.  It only seems to throw errors on large files, which would take 200 MB of memory to store the whole thing.p  pWhat I am wanting to know is how Coldfusion handles CFX tag loading and execution.  Since the CFX tag in particular was written in C, I would think that it wouldnt necessarily use the Coldfusion heap as it only stores Java data, and we are not seeing heap spikes when we process something.p  pI guess the major question is how the CFX gets executed does it run as a thread under JRUN, or does a native Windows process get created that runs in its own user space  And, if it does run under JRUN, what memory space does this use when executing, and is there a way to monitor itp

Negative 8945 pSo i am developing a quiz web application. And i wanted to add a setting that the administrator of the quiz could set that would make it so the user could only have 1 windowtab open while the quiz is being taken. p  pThe reason for this is to make it so they cant goto like google and google the answer while the quiz windowtab is open. Of course they could always open a different browser and do it that way, but still thought it would be a nice feature to have for them to enable.p  pNow i dont know if this would fall under a security sandbox violation and thus not be available at all but since i only want to detect if another tab or window is open and not get actual information about the tabwindow i am hoping that this is someway possible using javascript.p
Negative 8945 pSo, Im trying to take an .xsd file musicxml fixed standard, create an object class, use portions of it  specificially the note object  include it in a graph object, and then save both the graph object and a musicxml validated file.p  pAll in all, the solutions Im using have one or two massively breaking shortcomings.p  pXsd2Code  Creates the file but for some reason it makes a Items collection of the type I need, ObservableCollection, and then an enumerable ItemsChoiceType[09] ObservableCollection.  The problem with the enumerable is after it generates, I have to either have to switch the latter to an Array, or do mumbojumbo for the XmlSerialisation attrs.  Generates a 2mb .cs file, so alot of code that would be autogenerated and would have to have a crapton of .extend.cs files to get it to fit.  Maybe I have to change some switches for it to work  What switches fix thisp  pLinqToXsd  OpenLinqToXsd  Generates the file, hard codes it to reference a DLL file, then forces you to use List no option to go to ObservableCollection, which doesnt have EditItem and cant be used for binding to WPFXAML.  Otherwise, a bunch more .extend.cs files.p  pAltova C generator  Expensive, requires a bunch of their DLLs to include in the project, messy.p  hr  pLong story short, has anyone used any of these systems successfully and what did you have to do to shoehorn them  What kind of pain will I have to deal with beyond the issues Im havingp  hr  pI remember now for XSD.exe XSD notation doesnt export, individual classes such as note dont serialise out to xml.  I would have to write out the entire thing from scorepartwise to every piece inbetween.  Which means I cant serialise a graph object that has notes as vertices.p
Negative 8945 pIve built my own jQuery paging plugin.

Negative 8945 pSo since joining Ive learned a lot  compared to where I was  but I still dont know the terminology and functions well enough I suppose... so heres my problemp  pIm making several jsbased galleries. The idea being that there will be 34 pages containing some thumbnails that will populate a specific div with the corresponding art and copy a div Im calling using innerHTML and so far that works. Here is the scriptp  precodefunction changeDivtarget,id  var target  document.getElementByIdgeneric var id  document.getElementByIdid target.innerHTML  id.innerHTML   codepre  pThis works great... when I have the target and all ids in the same page. I even went as far as using a php include on the page I added it to the footer and nested it inside an inline div that I set to visibilityhidden. A shot in the dark but this worked too. EXCEPT that my footer was now about another 100px taller with nothing but blank space. Apparently it HID the content, but made plenty of room for it.p  pBut what I really want to do is include the source of the divs Im calling well call them artwork.php into the gallery page  ...and gallery1.php the same way a css or js is linked in the header or the same way it is included with a php tag but without messing up any of my objects.p  pI hope that made sense, but in brief How can I call an external php document that wont display but can be called upon by the jsp  pAny thoughts p

Negative 8945 pI am developing an application where i have a main activity consisting on the left of a fragment showing products. Depending on the selection, the right part of the landscapeview shows detailed information, where the products properties can be thoroughly specified.

Assume that I started the application in portrait mode, and I select the first product Activity A, Fragment A. The next screen separate Activity, call it Activity B will contain a Fragment B where I can specify Property 1 of the product. Now I rotate the screen. The application will then show the landscapeview where the first product is selected, and ALL fragments dedicated to product configuration are shown at the right. Is there a solution that I can retain the configurations done by the user in the separate activity i.e. Fragment B, Activity B in such a manner that the landscape view receives the state such that the details view can properly show the hitherto done configurationsp  pTo summarizep  pI am in Activity A, just containing a list of products Fragment A I select the first then I get to a new Activity B, where Fragment B is shown then I rotate my screen then I get back to Activity A, now containing at the left side Fragment A the list and at the right side among others Fragment B. I want the state of Fragment B in Activity B be available in Activity A, Fragment B.p  pHope I could completely specify my question.p  pTIA Geraldp

Similarly, there are a lot of properties in CustomerSO not in the interface.  If I were to go with the above route, I would have a ton of Ignore calls, and Id have to map CustomerBO to CustomerSO, and then CustomerSO to CustomerBO, each with their own unique list of Ignore calls.  Using the interfaces removes the need for the Ignore calls, as the data that I want to be visible from one to the other is defined in the interface.p  pSo, in short, my question is this  is there some way I can tell AutoMapper to use the interface map when it encounters one of the implementing classes Failing that, is there some other read better way than a Map call in a MapFrom delegate to enforce my interfacetointerface mapping in a asneeded basisp

Negative 8945 pIve read the Intel docs about enabling buffered IO with ifort using codeassume bufferediocode or codeFORTBUFFEREDtruecode, and this works for output directly to files. However, we have large applications that are writing to stdout e.g. codewrite,code or codewritestdout,code, which is redirected to a file. Neither of the buffering techniques work in this case.p  pOther than refactoring the code to write directly to files, is there a method to enable buffered IO on stdout with ifort This is enabled by default on, for example, gfortran.p  pWere using ifort 12.0 on SLES 11.p  pUpdate Thanks for the comments. Im investigating stdbuf andor piping through a buffering program like tee as a workaround. As yet, I havent been able to make a measurable difference.p  pUpdate 2p  pIve tried some experiments with Douglass suggestion, piping through another program. tee and cat both buffer, in face the buffering seems to done by the pipe itself at about 8K. However, the overhead of the original write calls, plus the pipe, plus the system calls of the piping program tee, cat etc. are too high to make this a workable solution.p

Lets say that x is 30. If I increase the cutoff to 31 hub genes, the 30th gene now shows connections to the others in the network, but the 31st gene shows nothing. In addition, this change increases AND decreases some of the number of connections to other genes in the network. This really bothers me, because connections should only be added, since the network is getting bigger by one gene, and the changes should be accounted for by the 30th gene, but this is not the case for the output.p  precode Split the cytoscape file into two parts edge and node node lt cytnodeData edge lt cytedgeData    The limit covers all of the connections in the edge file by determining the length of the column fromNode limit lt lengthedgefromNode   Create an empty list to store the counts for each gene counts  list   Loop for the genes going from 1 to the number of genes specified for the network, nTop for i in 1nTop    Reset the count for each new gene and specify the names of the gene of interest and the matching genes   name  nodenodeName[[i]]    count  0   Nested loop that searches for matches to the gene in question in both the fromNode and toNodecolumns, and adds one to the count for each match.   for j in 1limit      matchName1  edgefromNode[[j]]     matchName2  edgetoNode[[j]]     if name  matchName1  name  matchName2       count  count  1        Create a string for the attribute in the correct format     attribute lt pastename, , count   Adds the count to the list   counts lt ccounts, attribute     End of loop codepre  pThe loop seems to be working as expected, so Im thinking that the problem is with the network construction.

If the file is large, i.e. 300MB, the progress indicator rises slowly, but still faster than our upstream bandwidth would allow. After hitting 100 progress, the client then hangs, presumably waiting for the s3 upload to finish.p  pI know codeputStreamcode uses Nodes a hrefhttpnodejs.orgapistream.htmlstreamstreampipedestinationoptionsstream.pipea method internally, but I dont understand the detail of how this really works. My assumption is that node gobbles up the incoming data as fast as it can, throwing it into memory. If the write stream can take the data fast enough, little data is kept in memory at once, since it can be written and discarded. If the write stream is slow though, as it is here, we presumably have to keep all that incoming data in memory until it can be written. Since were listening for codedatacode events on the read stream in order to emit progress, we end up reporting the upload as going faster than it really is.p  pIs my understanding of this problem anywhere close to the mark How might I go about fixing it Do I need to get down and dirty with codewritecode, codedraincode and codepausecodep

Negative 8945 pI love the effect that the initial smoothHeight has when the page loads. I hate the way it slowly reacts to a page resizing after the initial load. I would love to keep the effect for the initial page load, and then fall back to the default resizing without animation. I have been chasing this for hours. By setting the smoothHeight variable back to false at the end of the smoothHeight function itself I can switch the variable back to false after the initial animation, but this disables any resizing of the height after the initial load.  This feels like a very simple operation, but I cant figure it out. Thanks ahead of time for any ideasp  pBasically, when this block is executed once, it sets the height so that, even once the variable is changed back to false, the height is no longer flexible.p  pcodesmoothHeight functiondur          if vertical  fade            var obj  fade  slider  slider.viewport           dur  obj.animateheight slider.slides.eqslider.animatingTo.height, dur  obj.heightslider.slides.eqslider.animatingTo.height                codep

Negative 8945 pIm having issues with my NSFetchedResultsController, which seem to be fixed by turning IncludesPendingChanges on, and this worries me. strongIve found this to not be true, including pending changes does not help.strongp  pWhat happens is that my Fetched Results Controller correctly fetches and displays my objects on a full API refresh. Stepping through, I have confirmed that this full API refreshs temporary context is saved and merged without error. p  pHowever, if I then return to a view which does this same fetch request from a different navigation flow, only one partially complete object is returned and displayed, rather than the complete set of objects. If I then do a full API Refresh at this point, the refresh displays the correct objects.p  pI believe my issue may be that mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification is not propagating to the main context, but from my logs and stepping through, it seems to me that it is saving correctly. Im not sure where to go from here. While IncludesPendingChanges fixes the symptom, I dont believe it fixes the underlying issue.p  pAs some added information, Im using this framework for my Core Data Management a hrefhttpsgithub.comvokalinteractiveCoreDataManageriOS relnofollowhttpsgithub.comvokalinteractiveCoreDataManageriOSap  pI am turning on includesPendingChanges by adding on line 156 of VIFetchedResultsController.m p  precode [fetchRequest setIncludesPendingChangesYES] codepre  pstrongEditstrong Whatever fluke caused me to believe includesPendingChanges to YES fixed the problem is no longer present.

Negative 8945 pThis is a very particular question so any input will be appreciated...p  pIm using panels and views in a custom view template file in a drupal 7 site. The panel has a view embedded in it, as well as some extra content beneath. I have the view set with 3 contextual filters having taxonomy term pulled from url. This is working fine. So if I go to something likep  precodesearchfordred codepre  pIt will successfully pull all items having taxonomy term ford that also have taxonomy term red applied.p  pBut interestingly enough, if I change one of the terms to something that exists in the vocabulary, but does not happen to have any relation to items that successfully pass the first criteria, it will just load the site wrapper with the panel blank. No errors of any kind, search filter box disappears, pagination disappears, even the other content embedded in the view disappears.p  pIt doesnt seem to matter what I choose for Action to take if filter value does not validate for any or all of the filters applied to the view. I tried to set it to show no results, but I assumed it didnt apply since I am also using a custom template file for the view.p  pI expect it to show no results. But I also expect it to have the search bar up top so the user can select a different filter from the menu, as well as the other content embedded in the view.p  pThe search box is custom to the view template file. The only reason it would not show is if the view itself does not load. In this case it looks like the whole panel is not showing.p  pFeel free to ask for specifics if this is not enough to go on. Thanks.p

Negative 8945 pI am working on an OSX app which is created using an open source common lisp implementation called CCL.

Instead, it connects   to a special sandbox store environment.

Negative 8945 pI dont really get this little thingy. I have an abstract class Box with several subclasses for different types. For examplep  precodeabstract class Box class StringBoxval sValue  String extends Box codepre  pThe apply method in the companion object for Box is simplep  precodeobject Box     def applys String   new StringBoxs     def applyb Boolean  new BooleanBoxb     def applyd Double   new DoubleBoxd  codepre  pso I can writep  precode    val sb  BoxStringBox codepre  pOkay, writing unapply makes some trouble. My first idea was to use pattern matching on the type, like this thisp  precodedef unapplyb Box  b match    case sb StringBox gt Somesb.sValue   case bb BooleanBox gt Somebb.bValue   case db DoubleBox gt Somedb.dValue   case  gt None codepre  p p  pWhich simply doesnt work because of type erasures. p  pSecond attempt was a generic Box[T] with type T and an abstract type member redefined  in each sub classes. For instancep  precode abstract class Box[T] def value  T  class StringBoxval sValue  String  extends Box[String]      override def value  String  sValue   codepre  pConsequently, I can re write my unapply asp  precodedef unapply[T]b Box[T]  b match    case sb Box[String]  gt Somesb.value   case bb Box[Boolean] gt Somebb.value   case db Box[Double]  gt Somedb.value   case  gt None codepre  pUnfortunately, this doesnt work either. So I guess the explicit type reference  in  Box[String] gets erased as well so I need to use a type manifest instead. Maybe something likep  precodedef unapply[T]b Box[]implicit target Manifest[T] Option[T]       ifb.value   target Someb.value.asInstanceOf[T]    else None   codepre  pThis code compiles 2.10 but still does not the desired implicit conversion.  Why p  pSimple question, is there a way to do value extraction without using reflection  or a manifest p  pWhat really boggles me is the question if there is a simpler way to combine polymorphism and pattern matching If not, are there other ways in Scala to  accomplish a similar effect p  pAny idea or suggestions p  pThank you very much.p

So a UIButton seems to be the most logical element to accomplish this, right I also need the buttons to be in a shape of a circle and can be placed on top of each other.p  pI have accomplished the first requirement have them of in a shape of a circle. The issue now is since a button is rectangular by default, the corners can still fire the touch events. This would be fine if a button is on the canvas on its own. But, if a circle button is on top of another, touch events fire the wrong event when a user taps close enough to the corner of the topmost button.p  pQuestion How can I avoid this situation What alternative do I have if this issue cant be fixed using a UIButton If I use another control, it needs to have support for the touch events mentioned above.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8945 pim going to write a little android app. Nothing complicated, with 6 screens. 4 of them are on the same view navigation hierarchy level. 2 are subscreens of one of those 4.p  pFor example screen A displays a list with information. By clicking on a list item the app will show screen A1. Screen A1 displays details about the previously selected list item. So Screen A1 is a subscreen of screen A. By clicking on the back button the app shows screen A.p  pScreen B has also a subscreen, called B1. The other screens are C and D which are on the same view navigation hierarchy as A and B but not A1 and B1. So A, B, C, and D are on the top of the view navigation hierarchy. The App will start with displaying screen A. In the action bar or in a sliding menu you will find buttons to jump to screen B, C and D.p  pI hope you got an idea of what im trying to do. So normally I would say, every screen is a own activity. Im a big fan of fragments and i normally use them everywhere. In fact I caught myself implementing activities that contains only one fragment, that contains the main view layout. And I can say there is absolutely nothing wrong to do so Fragments bring big advantages ... p  pBut now I wonder if it would be a good idea to use a single main activity and change only the fragments in this activity. So screen A, B, C, D, A1, B1 are Fragments instead of activities. So by navigating from Screen A to C I would simply replace fragment A with fragment C in the main activity instead of starting a new Activity that contains the fragment C. The same way I would implement a navigation from screen A to subscreen A1. p  pSo far I cant see nothing wrong with this approach. In my opinion it would be something like a ViewPager, just without swipe gestures to navigate between screens.p  pThe only thing Im not sure about it and thats my question is the memory management. Whenever I do a replace fragment transaction fragment manager to navigate from screen A to B the fragment A should be destroyed and the memory should be garbage collected somewhere in the future, right When do I instantiate Fragment B When the user clicks on the button to navigate to B and repalce A Could this bring performance issues time to instantiate the fragmentp  pWhat if I set all fragments A, B, C, D, A1 and B1 to setRetainInstanceStatetrue Than the class member fields of each screen will be hold in the memory until the MainActivity is finished rightp  pDoes anyone of you have experience with thatp  pA ViewPage uses some kind of preloading fragments and loads only the view layout of the next and previous fragment setOffscreenPageLimit p  pDo you guys think I have to do something similar to avoid memory and performace issues p

Negative 8945 pHello I have a problem,p  pWhen I try to upload my app to the Google Play Developer Console, it says the certificate fingerprints missmatch and shows another fingerprint than Im seeing when I export the APK via Eclipsein the last pane of the export wizard under SHA1 Fingerprint. The fingerprint Im seeing in eclipse is the correct one, I know this because I used it to generate a GoogleMaps API key and Its the same as it should be according to the missmatch error.p  pSo basically what I think is happening is that Eclipse is signing my apk with another certificate than Im telling it to use. Tough when I sign it using the debug keystore the fingerprints matchthe one im seeing in eclipse vs the one thats displayed in the missmatch error wich is very weird.p  pThis problem occured after I replaced my harddrives. But Im sure I am using the correct keystore because I backed it up before and am using the same one. Plus the fingerprint its showing in Eclipse matches the one it should be according to the error. p  pCould it have something to do with the googleplayserviceslib project thats used as a library Or because Im using another debug keystoreafter renstalling windowsp

Wouldnt the more general definition save us this trouble with only a minor tweak Is there some other obvious fix I can use do I dont bump into those problemsp  pThis problem gets extremely severe if one is having not intercept and is using factor variables with interactions. Practically R might try and treat one of the levels as an intercept.

Negative 8945 pSo, Im diddling around with rails ruby 1.9.3p392, rails 3.2, sqlite3 db and Im trying to deploy the ubiquitous blog tutorial code to a production server apache, passenger, ubuntu.  My deploy.rb looks like thisp  precoderequire bundlercapistrano require rvmcapistrano load deployassets set rvmrubystring,  ENV[GEMHOME].gsub., set rvmtype, user set user, blah set application, railsTest set domain, www.blah.com set applicationdir, homeseanpublicblah.compublic set scm, git set repository,  sshblah1.1.1.1homeblahpublicbla.compubliccapDep.git set gitenablesubmodules, 1  if you have vendored rails set branch, master set gitshallowclone, 1 set scmverbose, true set usesudo, false    roles servers role web, domain role app, domain role db,  domain, primary gt true   deploy config set deployto, applicationdir set deployvia, export set migratetarget, latest  additional settings defaultrunoptions[pty]  true   Forgo errors when deploying from windows sshoptions[keys]  whomeblah.sshidrsa sshoptions[forwardagent]  true  if you want to clean up old releases on each deploy uncomment this   If you are using Passenger modrails uncomment this namespace deploy do   task start do  end   task stop do  end   task restart, roles gt app, except gt  norelease gt true  do     run trysudo touch File.joincurrentpath,tmp,restart.txt   end end  after deployupdatecode, deploymigrate codepre  pNow, I am sure that must look like a big hot mess to those who know what they are doing with capistrano, but I am an utter rube. In the end, despite my inadequacies, the deploy seems to work, because when I run the followingp  precodecap deploysetup cap deploy codepre  pmy app is up and running and, just because I can, I add a few rows to a table in the db via the web ui that was created for me by rails.  Now, I get bold and create a migration, adding a column to a table.  I push my changes to git.  To my horror, when I run p  precodecap deploy codepre  pALL the migrations are run, which recreates the tables, thus destroying all my data.  I have repeated this painful process several times.  My schemamigrations table looks like thisp  precode20130620210004 20130620220229 20130628213331 20130628214946 20130628223002 codepre  pWhat am I missing here p  pstrongUPDATEstrong  I recently gave TheMahrvins suggestion regarding running deploymigrations at the command line and removing it from the deploy.rb.  It didnt work... once again, all migrations were run. My muse must have whispered something in my ear, because I decided to try running dbmigrate on the server itself.  I was astonished to see this output after running just rakep  precode  20130717230110 CreateHighScores   20130717230342 CreateGames   20130717231041 AddGameTypeToGame   20130717233707 AddGamePublisherToGame   20130717234124 AddGameRatingToGame   20130731210558 AddGameMechanicToGame codepre  pOnly the last migrations should be pending.  So, perhaps this isnt a problem with Capistrano at all Ive updated the title of this question to reflect that.  So, why are the previous migrations still being flagged as pending  I know they were run in the past, both because I saw them in the output and verified the db schema after they ran.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong  Setup another migration and sshd into the server and cdd my way to the current directory, which if I understand capistrano at all fat chance is where the current files are.

Negative 8945 pFor a project I am working onSpringstruts 2hibernate, we decided to use h2 for unit testing with MySQL for the production store and manage the scheme in liquibase, pretty standard fare, but the issue we keep on running into is that h2 and MySQL differ in a lot of ways, for example how they handle timestamps and triggers.  Its getting to the point that I am starting to regret using h2 as the extra headaches the mismatches are causing are starting to outweigh its benefits.  My question is this, is there any other inmemorylocal file database that behaves more like MySQL  Obviously for integration testing we will still use MySQL, but being able to do unit testing without either making the liquibase files into a giant hack or having to ensure the local MySQL db is running would be nice.p

I know this can be done by leveraging php or a stored procedure, but I am trying to do this without those things.

Negative 8945 pI am playing around with Scala right now and tried to figure out some best practices about how to design classes. Trying Scala since a week or so.p  pSince my Erlang time I am a huge fan of message passing and actor based software. In most Scala examples actor classes are implemented like thisp  precodeobject Foo object Bar class MyActor extends Actor    def receive       case Foo gt ...     case Bar gt ...     case  gt ...     codepre  pBut what I learned from my object oriented interfaces and polymorphism carrier tells me that this concept is not very flexible.p  pMyActor could be replaced by MyAdvancedActor but there is no contract which defines which messages an MyActor implementation needs to implement.p  pWhen I think about writing Actors in Scala I tend to write a trait which specifies some methods. The MyActor implementation needs to implement this methods in which the can send its own private messages to itself. With this approach we have a specified interface and can replace the MyActor implementation in a typesafe manner.p  pIn my time of reading scala tutorials and examples I did not come across such an class design. Is it not common sense or are there better ways in doing this in Scala Or are these tutorials just to small to cover such a topic p

Negative 8945 pFellow Programmers A wonderful afternoon or whatever the case to you With some assistance of fellow users I was able to manage getting an image to change back and forth between a second image every couple seconds. Its awesome So I counted out some of the math with the  operator, and sure enough when the image first displays, I get the default broken link image of the browser, but after the 2 seconds everything goes as planned. So begins this investigative experiment. I decided instead of swapping automatically, lets make the swap with a button as to be able to investigate the page as long as I would like. But who wants to do the exact same thing again, why not learn another cool trick along the way. That trick is to display both of the images at the same time, such that when the button is clicked they swap places. Same math, different effect for the user. Isnt that awesomep  pThe goal  display two images and below them one button. When the button is clicked the images are to swap places. The images that was on the left should be on the right, the one on the right ought now be on the left. Use no jQuery, this is after all a JavaScript experiment and I have yet to learn much jQuery but I cant wait to get therep  pBrowser error console messages Interestingly enough firefox give me nothing. I open the browser, load the page in it from VS 2012 clear the error conslole, refresh the page. And nothing. In chrome my default browser however, I get a localhost pic src 404 not found. I find this strange because this code is on a page that happens to have other code which references those same pictures and works fine. The 2 second auto img flip thing being some of that other code.p  pdebuggingIm to much of a noob to know whats going on with that. I get the basic Idea and looked into it some. On the VS site theres all this info about setting breaking points and running multiple instance of VS to do something with another engine. I will soon be on youtube to hammer that out. I apologize however, if there is some simple debug fix to this and I should have witnessed it.

Negative 8945 pIm developing a web site with web.py and nginx which, up until now I have been working on locally with the built in development server. Its now its time to move the site over to a live server. Id like to deploy the site so the root is something like codeexamples.comtestcode but all my url handling stuff is broken. I had thought I could create a codeurlprefixcode variable and pepper it around the web.py code but that sure seems dirty. It seems like the best thing to do would be to have nginx strip the prefix from the url so the web.py application never sees it but Im not sure its even possible.p  pDoes anybody know how to handle this situationp

Negative 8945 pI have a few libraries, each one is compiled as DLL and they are used by some apps. Ive just develop a class CLASSA inside one of those libraries LIB1 which inherits from a class CLASSB existing in another of those libraries LIB2 and so, it is compiled to another DLL.p  pSo far, I cant see any clear drawback with this solution.

Negative 8945 pIf you are running an Yiiapp on Appfog with mulitple instances, and you are using CAssetsManager for your static files, you will at least I did experience issues with broken links to static files.p  pI concluded that the reason is that each instance on AppFog will have a different paths to each asset. Heres an example. p  pstrongInstance 1strong codemntvarvcap.localdeaapps54dc7546ac14appprotectedassetslogo.pngcodep  pstrongInstance 2strong codemntvarvcap.localdeaapps54dc7546ac14appprotectedassetslogo.pngcodep  pstrongInstance 3strong codemntvarvcap.localdeaapps54dc7546ac14appprotectedassetslogo.pngcodep  pWhen Yii publishes these assets they will get different paths, since each path is based on a hash that is based on codedirnamecode returned by the function a hrefhttpsgithub.comyiisoftyiiblob1.1.14frameworkwebCAssetManager.phpL325 relnofollowgeneratePatha. I know about the option codehashByNamecode, but setting it to true will share the published path among different extensions.p  pTherefore the public path to the codelogo.pngcode will have three different possibilitiesp  pstrongInstance 1strong codehttpswww.example.comassetsfb4gf4ac45logo.pngcodep  pstrongInstance 2strong codehttpswww.example.comassetsab4ed4f394logo.pngcodep  pstrongInstance 3strong codehttpswww.example.comassetsfde07233bclogo.pngcodep  pThe strongimplicationstrong will be that when requesting strongwww.example.comstrong a arbitary instance will handle the request. Lets say it is eminstance 1em, which will give a response with a link that refers to codehttpswww.example.comassetsfb4gf4ac45logo.pngcode. The link will trigger a second request, and this time another arbitary instance will handle the request eminstance 2em.p  pThe problem is that the instance 2 cannot find codeassetsfb4gf4ac45logo.pngcode, since the file on this instance is located at codeassetsab4ed4f394logo.pngcode.p  pThis strongcan be handledstrong by using the a hrefhttpwww.yiiframework.comextensions3assetmanager relnofollowS3AssetsManagera, but it will still upload assets for each instance to S3, and that makes the site slow every time the codebase is updated.

Negative 8945 pGiven a set of numbers, from 1 to n, I need to model all sets of all possible pairs. p  pIn other words, one drawed set consists of all numbers. Numbers are paired.

Negative 8945 pI have a Javascript library Im working on.  It can be selfhosted or run from another server.  The script makes a number of AJAX calls and the preferred method is making POST requests to the same host as the including page.  To allow for crossdomain calls it also supports JSONP, but this limits the amount of data that can be sent 2K to safely accommodate most modern browsers URL length limits.p  pObviously the user including the script knows where theyre getting it from and could manually select JSONP as needed, but in the interest of simplifying things, Id like to detect, within the script itself, whether the script was loaded from the same host as the page including it or not.p  pIm able to grab the script element with jQuery but doing a script.attrsrc is only returning a relative path e.g. jsmyscript.js not a hrefhttphostname.comjsmyscript.js relnofollowhttphostname.comjsmyscript.jsa even when its being loaded from a different host.p  pIs this possible and if so, how would I go about itp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 8945 pI want to create a record of an entity, but I need to pass a list of guids to the pre create plugin. I dont want to create fields or related entities to do this. Can I use the Shared Variables to do itp  pIn other words is it possible to set shared variables before initiating the action that will trigger the plugins that will consume themp  pEDITp  pI can be creating this type of records from different points that integrate with crm, silverlight, external pages or even plugins of other entities. My current problem can be solved with a field on the entity, but this way if I had to send parameters to control the execution of the plugin for two or more independent actions I would need one field for each action or instead use only one field using a complex formatparse pattern to parameterize each different action. Using fields to accomplish this feature looks a bit excessive.p  pIf the shared variables could be set before the call of the action that will trigger the plugin that would solve the problem and I wouldnt have to create fields in the crm database, because the data I want to pass to the plugin it will only be needed at that time, like a parameter in a function, no need to persist them in the database.p  pBut if it is not possible I will have to stick with the fields p

Negative 8945 pI am building a very basic site for an online MMO PC Game Note Game has a built in API. I need the ability to allow users to upload a character settings file from their game settings directory on their PC to my web server. Once the file is uploaded they need to be able to modify the file name, to apply them to another character on the server, and to redownload the files.p  pExample I have a character named Tom. Each character has two settings files associated with itp  ul licoreuser1234567.datli licorechar12345678.dat filesli ul  pI have another character named Jerry. I want to set him up with the same exact settings as Tom. To do this I want to upload Toms settings files to the web server, input Jerrys codeuserIDcode and codecharacterIDcode values into a form, and redownload the files with those values appended while removing the old values from the uploaded file names. This essentially replaces the codecoreuserthis.datcode to codecoreuserthat.datcode.p  pThe steps I need to complete in order to get the functionality I require for the app to work. p  pStep 1. The user obtains the strongUserIDstrong and strongCharacterIDstrong for Tom from the games server by calling the games API for that character. User enters his API key into a form and submits. This will return the two values to be displayed in the browser. This is simply a reference call so i can display the values to the user in the browser so that the user knows which two settings files correspond to the character he is trying to clone in this case Tom. There may be many sets of settings files already in the folder. This step I can achieve already.p  pStep 2. Once the user knows which two settings files belong to Tom the user then locates and uploads Toms settings files to the webserver.p  pStep 3. Now, once the files are on the server the user needs to obtain the stronguserIDstrong and strongcharacterIDstrong for Jerry. I do the same thing as in Step 1. Make an API call and display the returned value to the browser so the user knows the values. p  pStep 4. The user can then insert the values into a form and submit it. Once submitted the values are appended onto the settings files that are temporarily being stored on the server and a download link is generated.p  pStep 5. User downloads the new settings files to the settings directory and its done. Jerry now has the same settings files as Tom.p  pEDIT My inquiry is regarding step 2 and step 5. The PHP side of things. How does one write this simple upload script. Upload the file, pass in a string to the file name replacing everything after the second  and before the .dat, then generate the download link coreuserreplacethisstring.datp

Consequently, any event triggered in codeSonViewModelcode that is being listened by codeFatherViewModelcode gets caught.br The two most important facts here are that both father and son are created at the same time and the son is created in the XAML like sop  precodeltViewSonView DataContextBinding SonViewModel, ModeOneWay gt codepre  pThis works fine does exactly what I want.brbrp  pThe problem comes with the grandfather and the father because theyre not created at the same time. I first create the codeGrandfatherView.xamlcode and in its associated codeGrandfatherView.cscode I know its not MVVM practice, but Im trying to implement some MVVM features in a project thats not with MVVM pattern I create and add the codeFatherViewcode to a codeGridcode, like sop  precodeFatherView fatherView  new FatherView fatherView.DataContext  new FatherViewModel mainGrid.Children.AddfatherView codepre  pBecause Im creating the codeFatherViewcode after I created the codeGrandfatherViewcode and adding it through code and not having a specific binding, when I create the codeFatherViewModelcode object in my codeGrandfatherViewModelcode class, its not pointing to the actual ViewModel of the codeFatherViewcode I see in my app.br Im not sure how to create the binding codeltViewSonView DataContextBinding SonViewModel, ModeOneWay gtcode in code, so I can make sure the attributes and bindings are the same, so the ViewModel object I have in my codeGrandfatherViewModelcode is actually the one I see in my app and not a completely new object.brbrp  pSo, any suggestionsp

Negative 8945 pI have an application in which I display a form so a user can search for client records based on last name. After entering search parameters, the record or records there could be multiple clients with the same last name are displayed. I then want the user to be able to select a client record, possibly with a radio button, and hit one of two buttons Display details, or Create Reservation. The Display Details button should cause a new display with details of the selected record. The Create Reservation button should cause a new form, with its own handling, to be displayed.p  pNow, I know I can set things up according to this loginp  precodeltphp if display button was pressed           php code to retrieve more data and display details    else if create reservation button was pressed      php code to generate and display the reservation form, with appropriate handling   gt codepre  pdisplay the original form with the search resultsp  pThe problem is, I end up with really ugly, hard to read code because the php code to generate and display the reservation form is lengthy, and needs its own validation, database interaction, and form handling. The code, to my Javaoriented eye, looks ugly and nonmodular. Plus, the code  for handling the reservation form is icky, with lots of flag setting to determine if we are in form entry mode or form handling mode. I would like a much cleaner way to do this. So my question is, what is the best practice for handling the situation where there are multiple buttons and the action associated with each button is complexp  pI could call a function, obviously, but I still end up with the ugly flags determining which state the script is in are we displaying the reservation form or handling it. I could create another php file and include it, but the ugliness persists. Or, I could use header, and pass the client record id in a session variable to the new php script. But that would mean a second, unnecessary retrieve from the database to get the client information again.p  pAll the code examples I see on the web show very simple processing after a form button is pressed. What is the best way to do complex processing and displaying a second form based on a button pressp

Negative 8945 pIn my html5based mobile app I have an image uploader which has the very basic functionality like any other  an image thumbnail once the picture to be uploaded is selected. For resizing down to the thumbnail size for preview purpose, Ive played around with 2 waysp  ol liSimply set width and height on img tag and let the browser do the resize li liUse canvas to explicitly resize the image down to my desired size. li ol  pAnd I need some help choosing which way to go. So from some of my different tests Ive boiled them down to these observed pros and cons.p  pstrongSpeedstrongp  pIt takes more time to do the work in javascript when using canvas to resize than just setting the src for img tag. However, my observation is that once the image is resized with canvas the display is much faster than using the img tag. p  pFor instance, it would take around 1 to 2 seconds for the image to be seen after I add the Image object to be shown. Whereas it takes almost no time for the image to be seen after the drawImage method finishes for canvasbased resize. This led me to think that the actual resize for img tag only happens when the image is added into viewp  pEitherway, both img and canvas rounded up at about the same speed with distribution of time  used in different areas.p  pstrongMemorystrongp  pI need somebody to tell me if this is truep  ol liIn Img tag, the fullsize info of the image is still being stored although its resized on display.li liAnd of course, in canvas, the image has already been redrawn to a smaller size image, so only the smaller image info is taking up memory.li ol  pSo using the Img tag takes more memory unnecessarily just for thumbnail display purposep  pstrongThumbnail Qualitystrongp  pThis I actually dont really care because my thumbnail is rather small. But I bet they are going to be similar anyway with Img tag having more variation across browsersp

Negative 8945 pSo here is the question . I have an application running in weblogic 8 which is heavily dependent on JMS messages .

The MQ server has two Queue Managers and two different Connection Factory name for those managers .p  precode    ltweblogicenterprisebeangt     ltejbnamegtMDBQM1ltejbnamegt     ltmessagedrivendescriptorgt         ltdestinationjndinamegtQM1ltdestinationjndinamegt         ltinitialcontextfactorygtweblogic.jndi.WLInitialContextFactoryltinitialcontextfactorygt         ltconnectionfactoryjndinamegtCF1ltconnectionfactoryjndinamegt     ltmessagedrivendescriptorgt     ltweblogicenterprisebeangt     ltweblogicenterprisebeangt      ltejbnamegtMDBQM2ltejbnamegt     ltmessagedrivendescriptorgt         ltdestinationjndinamegtQM2ltdestinationjndinamegt         ltinitialcontextfactorygtweblogic.jndi.WLInitialContextFactoryltinitialcontextfactorygt         ltconnectionfactoryjndinamegtCF2ltconnectionfactoryjndinamegt     ltmessagedrivendescriptorgt             ltweblogicenterprisebeangt codepre  pNow the application is to be migrated to weblogic 10.3 and the configurations has already been done in test for that  .ejb version has changed to 3 and they have used annotations in the mdbs for queue config and such .But the real problem is this ,the application used to listen to the MQ directly and now they have configured a bridge which will transfer the message from MQ to a internal queue and the mdb will listen to that queue . The source MQ queue config in weblogic bridge config has only one connection factory in there and I am not sure if its possible to configure multiple queue managers , connection factories etc in a single queue . But in production there will be multiple queue managers etc . p  pI think its possible if I configure foreign servers for those queues then the clustering will be possible . But that will mean a huge change in the application and weblogic config also . So the ideal solution I am searching for is a way to connect to those multiple MQ queue managers with the existing bridge configuration. If its not possible , please suggest the next best thing .

Negative 8945 pThanks for checking. I exported a DUMP from JDEJD Edwards enterprise Resourse Planning Application to an excel file. i intend importing the excel file to MS SQL Server so that each departments can run a report from my application which i will then export as an excel file. But the issue i am having is that the date in my imported excel file is not in the same format. some are strings while some are date although they look like a valid date. the same applies to the field containing the total amount for each transaction. So when i try to import to MS SQL all the data that are not in date format are replaced with null. Please does any have an idea of how i can make all the values in the date column to have the same data type. i have tried using the following suggestions but havent gotten a result yet. codeDATEVALUE10032014code code10032014codep  pAny suggestion would be appreciated.

Negative 8945 pI have an internal C application that will indefinitely growso much so that weve had to implement logic that actually kills it once the RSS reaches a certain peak size 2.0G just to maintain some semblance of order.  However, this has shown some strange behaviors.p  pFirst, I ran the application through Valgrind w memcheck, and fixed some random memory leaks here and there.  However, the extent of these memory leaks were measured in the 10s of megabytes.  This makes sense, as it could be that theres no actual memory leakingit could just be poor memory management on the application side.p  pNext, I used Valgrind w massif to check to see where the memory is going, and this is where it gets strange.  The peak snapshot is 161Mnowhere near the 1.9G peaks we see using the RSS field.  The largest consumption is where Id expectin stdstringbut this is not abnormal.p  pFinally, and this is the most puzzlingbefore we were aware of this memory leak, I actually was testing this service on AWS, and just for fun, set the number of workers to a high number on a CC2.8XL machine, 44 workers.  Thats 60.5G of RAM, and no swap.  Fast forward a month I go to look at the hostand low and behold, its maxed out on RAMBUT  The processes are still running fine, and are stuck at varying stages of memory usagealmost evenly distributed from 800M to 1.9G.  Every once in a while codedmesgcode prints out an Xen error about being unable to allocate memory, but other than that, the processes never die and continue to actively process i.e., theyre not stuck.p  pIs there something Im missing here  Its basically working, but for the life of me, I cant figure out why.  What would be a good recommendation on what to look for next  Are there any tools that might help me figure it outp

Negative 8945 pI am newish to C.  Lately I have been working on a system that gets inputs from a bunch of other systems via sockets, MQSeries, and other avenues.  Basically my job is to pull these various sources together and put them into a homegrown XMLlike format and either store them in the appropriate database or pass them along to some other system.  Consequently I am creating formatted strings emallem the time.  Very simplified they look like thisp  precodelttaggtlotsa string datalttaggt...repeat ad ad nauseam codepre  pSo I started using codesprintfcode and codevsprintfcode and it was easy to work up a routine to concat the format string for sprintf together but the problem is that I have no advanced knowledge of the length of the strings I am receiving so it is difficult know the size of the buffer to allocate.  I get strings that can be 25 bytes long or 250k bytes.  No telling.  So of course I overran a buffer once or twice.  That led me to use codesnprintfcode which is OK but just passes the buck back to me to realloc buffers when they get truncated and try again.p  pSo I know this isnt the biggest problem in the universe and I can add up the lengths myself but is there a way to make this a little easier in C or should I just stop whining and figure out some kind of recursive function to add up all the string lengths in advancep

Negative 8945 pSo I am learning about vimviex and I thought I had a pretty good understanding of the buffer system. theres a gen purpose buffer and you can also name buffers. I know that anytime you use yank, change or delete, the contents of the general purpose buffer are over written. p  pHowever, I was given a task to use a viex command to delete the last 2 lines of the buffer and I am stumped. I cant seem to find the answer by searching the forums or the Internet in general so I thought I would ask the gurus of the interwebs for some help here. p  pIs there a way to directly modify the contents of a buffer, or is the answer simply to paste the buffer, delete the last 2 lines and then yank it again p  pAny help is appreciated.p  pEDIT I would like to edit this question to include the questionwhat is the difference between a buffer and a registerp  pI originally thought they were essentially the same thing, but have since learned otherwise. p  pMy new understanding is that the things I were previously referring to as buffers are actually registers, which makes more sense according to my knowledge of computers. p  pNow, I believe the buffer is just the current copy of the text that you are modifying. Or more specifically, the area of main memory in which you are manipulating data. So the answer to my question would actually just be 1,dp  pHowever, I have run into conflicting information on these forums that say the opposite, referring to registers as Buffers.p  pIf someone could clear that up I would be really appreciative. p  pstrongEDIT vim help got me all the answers I needed, cant delete the post though. It should be noted that there are a lot of answers to questions both on this site and many others that are voted up highly, but refer to registers as buffers incorrectly.strong p

Negative 8945 pIve written a simple quotes Android app Activity that I am adding a share option to. When the share icon is pressed, the quote is sent as text to the share handler external to my app and a menu of listening appsthatcansharestuff is displayed Email, Facebook, Google, Evernote, and the like. So far, so good. p  pOne of the share options offered is Add a pin which is pinterest.com coming to the party. However when selected, an error message via Toast is displayed saying Please use a valid Web address. p  pWhile the shared text did originate in a WebView, the content itself is not a URL, not even HTML, its just plain text. The WebView, decoupled from the share logic, should not factor into the equation either. The simplified code I am using to replicate this sharing mishap follows p  precode public void share      String textToShare  In the beginning was the thing, and one thing led to another.  Tom Robbins     Intent share  new IntentIntent.ACTIONSEND     share.setTypetextplain     share.putExtraIntent.EXTRATEXT, textToShare     startActivityIntent.createChoosershare, Share this quote...    codepre  pThe behavior suggests that pinterest.com is only interested in sharing links perhaps downloading entire web pages for all I know. Now, since Im only sharing locally generated text, my question I guess is p  pIs there a way in my code of excluding an app like pinterest that expects a valid Web address from getting notified when plain text is being shared. p  pMy grasp of the Android share logic is minimal Im an Android dev newbie, still Im hoping there may be some code modification flag that would exclude the nonfunctioning Add pin from appearing in the externaltoapp share menu. Hope all that makes sense.p

Negative 8945 pIm using Selenium python bindings, with Django for automated web app testing.  My page has a form with a button, and the button has a code.clickcode handler that captures the click i.e. the form is not immediately submitted.  The handler runs codefunction2code, and when codefunction2code is done, it submits the form. p  pIn my test with Selenium, I fill in the form, then click the Submit button.  I want to verify that the form is eventually submitted resulting in a POST request.  The form POSTs and then redirects with GET to the same url, so I cant check for a new url.  I think I need to check that the POST request occurs.  How do I check for successful form submissionp  pAlternatively I could check at the database level to see that some new object is created, but that would make for a bad unit test.p

In particular I note that a hrefhttpwww.linuxadvocates.com201309isopensslscryptographybroken.html relnofollowthe security of the secp256r1 curve has been questioneda.emp  pIn searching the internet for help my attention was called to the secondtolast provider listed in my codejava.securitycode filep  precodesecurity.provider.9sun.security.ec.SunEC codepre  pWhy is this here  Why is it commented outp  pI have tried using SSL TLS client keys based on both the codesecp256k1code and codesecp256r1code curves.  Ive also tried adding bouncycastle as a provider.  With the server certificate using codesecp256k1code I cannot establish a connection, even with the bouncycastle provider available on the other hand, if the server and client keys are both based on the codesecp256r1code curve then I can establish a secure connection.p  pSo far, my understanding is that there is a SunEC cryptographic provider that supports all EC curves but is not included with OpenJDK, that if I could find and install the proper java codejarcode file and binary shared binary library then I could use that provider, but also that there is some incompatibility between that and the included codert.jarcode file.p  pFurthermore, I understand that the SunPKCS11 provider, which is included with OpenJDK, handles a subset of EC curves, including codesecp256r1code, but not codesecp256k1code.  If bouncycastle is available then it seems to kicks in when trying to use the codesecp256k1code curve for the client key, but not for the server key.  I have little confidence in the accuracy of my understanding because its based on information from thread comments and other nonauthoritative sources.p  pI am additionally confused by the fact that invoking the method codesun.security.ec.NamedCurve.getECParameterSpecsecp256k1code returns an EC Parameter Specification, indicating that my JDK emdoesem know about that curve.  So Im confused why it cannot handle SSL certificates using keys that are based on that curve.p  pAt this point I am able to establish a secure connection, but only with certain EC curves.  I would like to have the option of using more curves, and in general am very curious of why there is a commentedout provider specified in the distributed codejava.securitycode file.  Thats my question why is it there how can I use itp
Negative 8945 pI have developed an app to analyze videos using OpenCV and Visual Studio 2013.  I was planning to run this app in the Azure assuming that it will run faster in cloud.  However, to my surprise, the app ran slower than my desktop, taking about twice the time when I configured the Azure instance with 8 cores.  It is a 64bit app, compiled with appropriate compiler optimization.  Can someone help me understand why am I losing time in the cloud, and is there a way to improve the timing therep  pThe app takes as input a video locally in each case and outputs a flat file with the analysis data.p  pI am not sure why people are voting to close this question.  This is very much about programming and if possible, please help me in pinpointing the problem.p

Negative 8945 pI have got a DataTable bound to a DataGridView. The DataTable is filled with max 30000 rows. The DataGridView should show the content of the DataTable while it is filled, which can take up to 3 minutes, because of some calculation process.p  pEvery Row contains textcells and two image cells. In the beginning i was loading all images directly to the DataTable, but at some point 10000 rows the programm crashed, because the system was out of memory. So i adapted my code a bit. The problem was, that the images are consuming a lot of memory. Now i only load images which can be seen by the user. This helps a lot and the system does not crash anymore loading 30000 rows. p  pThe problem only occures while scrolling heavily through the rows. I set images using the piece of code provided by Alireza Maddahp  precodepublic void GetVisibleCellsDataGridView dgv      ClearImages     var vivibleRowsCount  dgv.DisplayedRowCounttrue     var firstDisplayedRowIndex  dgv.FirstDisplayedCell.RowIndex     var lastvibileRowIndex  firstDisplayedRowIndex  vivibleRowsCount  1     for int rowIndex  firstDisplayedRowIndex rowIndex lt lastvibileRowIndex rowIndex              var cells  dgv.Rows[rowIndex].Cells         foreach DataGridViewCell cell in cells                      if cell.Displayed                               This cell is visible...

I set images if row is visible to the user and i save the index of the row to a list. Before setting the image i call ClearImages. This function sets all rows which have images to null, using the index entries from list.p  pI think that setting the variables to null does not free the memory, but this was just my first thought. What do you think Any ideas p  pI can not use paging or virtual mode...p

Negative 8945 pIve been trying to figure this out for a while now. So im working on an app where the user enters a username and password and i send the form to the server using a POST request. After that point, when i try to click on a link, the server does not recogize that i am logged in. So i researched about this and learned that it has to do with handling session cookies. From what i understand, i have to get the cookie from the SetHeader header that the server gives me, and use that cookie in all subsequent POST requests by adding it to a Cookie request header. I did exactly that in my app and the server still does not recognize that i am logged in. Am i missing a step here To add to this, i have tried testing this on a chrome plugin, POSTMAN, where i do the initial post with the username and password, get the correct response and a cookie, then when i do the second post with the cookie as the header, i still get the message that i am not logged in. The only time that i can get a successful response from the second POST is when i do the initial log in through the actual website on chrome, then the second POST using the plugin. Then i get the correct response and the server recognizes that i am logged in. But obviously that is no help since it has nothing to do with the app, just the browser and the plugin. So why is this How different is logging in through chrome than through the plugin or the app Anyways, please help me out here and let me know if you want to see any of the code. All i want to know is if im missing a step in handling and sending the session cookie, because thats what it seems like. Thanks.p

Negative 8945 pI am looking for a better way to structure my research projects. I have the following setup p  pThere are projects codeacode,codebcode,codeccode and a library codelibcode. Each project tackles a different research question and the library carries code that is used across projects. Thus all projects depend on codelibcode. Things get more complicated as project codeccode depends on projects codeacode and codebcode as well. When I work on project codeccode, I will also update codeacode,codebcode or codelibcode simultaneously. Each project is in a separate git repository. p  pSo far I have dealt with this situation by including the dependencies above via codegit submodulecode and all the source files are located in the root dir of the project. The advantage is that I keep track of which version of codelibcode my projects depend. Also one of my projects could depend on an outdated version of codelibcode. I run everything from the root directory without installing any of the packages to sitepackages or so. When a path is not set correctly, I override it via codesys.path.insertcode. p  pHowever, the following points make me want to change layout p  ul liI keep losing track of which version of codelibcode I am editing. li liI want to make use of automated testing tools tox,jenkins etc. which seem to be much easier to handle with a standard project setup. li licodesys.path.insertcode can lead to subtle problems which are hard to debug.  li liI usually want all my projects to work with the tip of codelibcode anyway. li ul  pTherefore I am currently rearranging all projects especiall codelibcode to be in line with the standard Python directory structure source stored in a subdirectory, root contains a codesetup.pycode file to be able to work in a codevirtualenvcode. Then I can list all my dependencies in coderequirements.txtcode. First I install codelibcode as develop via pip install e . Then I run pip freeze  requirements.txt which then includes a line similar to this. p  precodee gitltpathtoremotegtltshagtegglib codepre  pSo again I have generated a dependency to a specific commit sha as with codegit submodulecode, ensuring that I can checkout an old commit and the project should run. I can now install everything in a codevirtualenvcode and got rid of my path problems. Great.p  pI face some new trouble though. One problem is, how to update the sha in coderequirements.txtcode. The easiest but probably not most elegant solution I see is to write a codeprecommit hookcode that updates the sha before commiting. Is there a better way p  pAnd more generally  do you see a better solution given my setup p

Im going to keep searching in the meantime.p  hr  pEdit  with responses to commentsp  pI was looking to see if there was a standard way of doing this, or at least a bestpractice. The end product will eventually allow the user to change settings on the hardware, force the hardware to send information to other hardware, read information about the hardware and other hardware attached to the beaglebone black. Itll eventually get quite expansive, and so what I really need is a resource perhaps a book where I can read about how this sort of thing is usually done.p  pThe whole thing will eventually incorporate PWMs, GPIOs, ADCs, etc.p  pAs for the method of accessing the leds, I understand exec cat isnt the best way to get that information.p  pI have since changed the entire set up so that now, when the beaglebone black boots, it loads a c program that runs in a loop, and writes files with hardware information.p  pThen, the webpage calls that were originally running exec cat are now just loading the programs output file into the browser. This solved the crashing problem, but just doesnt feel like the correct method of doing this project, because there would be a ton of files with information in them about the ADC values, the PWM values, etc. To further convolute things, the file accesses would really need a mutex to prevent the c program from writing a file while the web program was reading it, and a mutex to prevent the web program from reading a file if the c program were currently writing it. That would make 3 files per process. p

Negative 8945 pIm tasked to use a DB25 parallel port to take in a digital 8bit result from an ADC and process it into a signal which can be displayed by Seven Segment Displays using emu8086.

At the moment I connected them, all 8 LEDs lit up. Why is it sop  pIt seemed I cant control the circuit hardware just by using User Port and emu8086 through a parallel port.p  pIve looked up some sites saying that in order to connect the real parallel port to the virtual port of emu8086, Im required to involve C.

Negative 8945 pI have a API to allow players to explore a region, which randomly returns a resource. Such action would cost some game currency, so the player information is updated as a result.

Negative 8945 pI wonder if someone can point me in the right directions.  I have followed some procedures from similar posts about debugging signed apk using eclipse Attach process method. p  pI can attach fine by selecting the known running app and clicking on the green bug  icon.  So now I can stop break points.  However for some reason I am never able to run at the startup MAIN activity. p  pThis makes sense as the app is already running and proceeded way past MAIN activity by the time I am able to see it, select it, attach to it.  So I figure its a race you will always be a little behind in.  Anyone know of a solution to this  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 8945 pI couldnt find anything relevant searching. I am doing bulk inserts and or updates depending on whether a previous record exists based on data read in from exported CSVs. p  pWhat is below persists two records two the database, whereas I would like it to insert and then update that same record.p  pIf there is already an record in the db, it works as expected, just updating the existing row. p  pPreviously, I was checking if null and just doing if else for inserting updating and everything worked fine. That had a lot of redundancy in the setters, so I changed it to this. My hope is that it will always run the update, but in the event a record isnt found, it will create a minimally viable pathology record that is subsequently updated. The update works fine  the problem is when no prior record exists, it creates an additional record. p  pIs this because of where and how the transaction is being merged and committed I do not understand why the second merge creates a new insert when I am passing it an object to update that must already exist. p  pI can get everything working as I would like, but I want to better understand why this isnt behaving as I would expect.

Negative 8945 pI have been playing around on Xcode with size classes to try and make sense of it. The problem I have is that many different sized phones all fit into the same size class like all iPhones in portrait so I cant home in on a 3.5 inch screen for example. This is frustrating as I would like to change the layout constraints between phones rather than just classes as obviously I need to make the gaps between things larger or the buttons slightly bigger to keep everything in proportion. I dont know if it is something I have missed but it seems the only way I can do this is by creating every single layout constraint I want to change as an outlet and then testing in code for each phone and updating it using a rough estimate and run the thing on the simulator. p  pIn Summary, how can I adjust the constraints based on the size of a device, when theyre all in the same class Using a percentageproportional constraint should give me the result Im after.p

The Windows 8 app works perfectly with the exact same code. This must be some issue with the Windows Phone. Everything else works, it just crashes when the phone trys to play media.p  pNot all the elements that play sounds crash the program, unless you click them a few times. Some elements always crash on the first click. No sounds ever play, even if the program doesnt crash with the exception it never plays any sounds.p  pONE time and only one time it played the first couple frames of one of the animation files .wmv and then crashed.p  pIt is a weird problem. All the code is copied from the working Windows 8 program and everything works except for the media. If I comment out the sound.plays and I disable the media player the program works fine. p  pAt first I thought it might be that the resources werent copying so I set the Copy to Output Directory to Always Copy. No effect. p  pI tried the simulators and I tried it on physical hardware, it is the same on everything.p  pIt isnt a resource issue, the simulators and the hardware have more than enough system resources, the whole app is only 22mbs.p  pIts not a codec issue, the animation is a .wmv file and the sounds are all .wav. Both should be natively supported on any windows device.p  pI have searched around and seen others with similar problems but I havent seen any solutions.

There are just too much elements in the array to insert.p  pI tried to automate the creation of inserts using this code and it works fine, and I like the way it came out, but I cant use this code or automate it with the json arrays whose elements have serialized json arrays themselves.p  precodefunction createquery tablename, cols, placeholders        query INSERT INTO tablename                                             cols                                                      VALUES                                                               placeholders                                                arg1 tablename   function insertintotable  argums, location        numclasses location[ numclasses ]       foreach location as key gt value               key value           keys arraykeys argums       tablename      keys[ 0 ]      arrayshift keys      arrayshift argums      cols implode , , keys        boundarray array      echo vardump keys       foreach keys as ampvalue               boundarray[ value ]  argums[ value ]          value .value           placeholders implode , , keys       query createquery tablename, cols, placeholders       return array query gt query, bind gt boundarray     function doinsert arr       global db      echo vardump arr      query arr[ query ]     bind  arr[ bind  ]      stmt dbgtprepare query      echo vardump stmt       if stmtgtexecute bind                echo vardump stmtgterrorInfo            affectedrows stmtgtrowCount       assocarr insertintotable array company gt company, companyNamegt companyName, pkid gt pkid, reminderEmailTop gt reminderEmailTop, reminderEmailBottom gt reminderEmailBottom, reminderLink gt reminderLink , location       doinsert assocarr       assocarr insertintotable array companyNav gt companyNav, companyId gt pkid, typegt basiclifetype, pagenav gt basiclifepagenav, orderby gt basiclifeorderby , location       doinsert assocarr       assocarr insertintotable array companyNav gt companyNav, companyId gt pkid, typegt benetype, pagenav gt benepagenav, orderby gt beneorderby , location       doinsert assocarr       assocarr insertintotable array companyNav gt companyNav, companyId gt pkid, typegt benepertype, pagenav gt beneperpagenav, orderby gt beneperorderby , location       doinsert assocarr       assocarr insertintotable array companyNav gt companyNav, companyId gt pkid, typegt denttype, pagenav gt dentpagenav, orderby gt dentorderby , location       doinsert assocarr       assocarr insertintotable array companyNav gt companyNav, companyId gt pkid, typegt eflextype, pagenav gt eflexpagenav, orderby gt eflexorderby , location       doinsert assocarr       assocarr insertintotable array companyNav gt companyNav, companyId gt pkid, typegt hsatype, pagenav gt hsapagenav, orderby gt hsaorderby , location       doinsert assocarr  codepre  p....and about 50 more of these type of inserts..p  phowever with the inserts that have elements who are json arrays themselves i couldnt use the above code.p  pso i created a function which is just one manually typed insert...p

Negative 8945 pI have a piece of code that marshals synchronizations. There are two types of syncs that need to happen, low priority initiated by navigation events on a treeview and high priority initiated by an exclusive Synchronize from a context menu.p  pI use a Queue collection to keep track of the items to be Syncd. With a high priority queue to be processed before items on the low priority. Also, I want to put a limit of say 20 or 30 items on the low priority queue.p  pSo I wrote this codep  precode Queue for high priority items. QueueltSyncItemgt syncQueueHighPriority  new QueueltSyncItemgt   Queue for low priority items. QueueltSyncItemgt syncQueueLowPriority  new QueueltSyncItemgt   Sync in progress flag. Boolean syncInProgress  false  public void SyncHighPriorityobject data       Add item to queue to be syncd when ready.     SyncItem item  new SyncItem  SyncPriority  Priority.High, SharePointListItem  data      syncQueueHighPriority.Enqueueitem       Iniate a sync.     ProcessSync   public void SyncLowPriorityobject data       Add item to queue to be syncd when ready if within the limit of the queue.     SyncItem item  new SyncItem  SyncPriority  Priority.High, SharePointListItem  data      if syncQueueLowPriority.Count lt 20         syncQueueLowPriority.Enqueueitem       Iniate a sync.     ProcessSync   private void ProcessSync      if syncInProgress         return      SyncItem item  null       The item will be set by a high priority sync before a low priority item.     if syncQueueHighPriority.Count gt 0         item  syncQueueHighPriority.Dequeue     else               Set low priority if there are no high priority items.         if syncQueueLowPriority.Count gt 0             item  syncQueueHighPriority.Dequeue            If we have an item to sync, then sync it.     if item  null         Syncitem   private void SyncSyncItem itemToSync      syncInProgress  true       Do sync operations.      SYNCSTUFF      syncInProgress  false       then process the next item if one exists.     ProcessSync     Data classes sample public class SyncItem      public Priority SyncPriority  get set      public object SharePointListItem  get set    public enum Priority      High  1,     Low  0  codepre  pI dont necessarily think this is the cleanest code because of the fact I have two queues to manage. I would like one collection essentially that always processes high priority items first and limits the amount of low priority items that can be queued.p  pFrom reading, I believe C reactive extensions would be a much better way to approach this.  Im a complete newbie to it though and it seems very complicated. Ive read a few articles but not sure the best way to convert what I have to something that works how I need. Could anyone point me in the right direction of how to convert this to use reactive extensionsp

The space between addreses 0x80484260x8048436 is equal to 10. So it turns out that four instructions took 10 addresses.

Negative 8945 pIm on Windows 7 using VS2013 building against the 2010 compiler weve migrated our dev environments, but not all the projects.p  pI dont really know how to characterize this problem, or Id google it. I have a pointer into a byte buffer, its our wire protocol the code base predates Google and their protocol buffers. We have headers that indicate an id and a type cast the pointer into the appropriate type and you can access the data and if the data is dynamic in size, like a string field, a length. None of this should be surprising, if not a bit old school...p  pBut what Im seeing is Ive got code that checks the field id  it should never be zero. But the condition is hitting, and when I inspect the element in the debugger, the buffer contents and pointer position are all correct  the field is nonzero.p  pSo my questions to youp  p1 How would I be able to better express this problem so I can google itp  p2 Have you seen this before Any ideasp

Negative 8945 pI have been piecing together a model for the best part of today using ContentTypeGeneric Foreign Key as, from my Googling, it seemed to be the solution I was looking for. However, now that I have something rendering, it doesnt seem to be the case. p  pAll I want is a foreign key dropdown that allows the user to select a record from One of Two models. With a GenericForeignKey it lists the models specified in my limit statement but then expects the user to know the IDPK and enter it in the objectid field.

Negative 8945 pIve got a question about hawt.io security. Ive installed hawt.io as a web application currently its embedded jetty but we have an option to use tomcat in an embedded  regular mode as well. Hawt.io visualizes the JMX mbeans tree of the same process, we dont connect to remote servers, everything is local. What I would like to do is to find the best way to provide an authentication and authorization mechanism to be usedp  ul liUsers authentication should be done preferably via LDAPli liUser authorization some users can gain full access to all mbeans, others are restricted to not execute mbean operations, but only read attributes.  li ul  pI thought that I can install a web filter, in jetty I can do it outside the web.xml and check requests, but since hawt.io uses POST web method to communicate to its internal jolokia, the identifier of the operation execution is inside the body of the request, so I dont really have an access to it from within the web filter since in Java Servlets I can read the request body only once. I know I can provide a fake request, but maybe there exists a better solution.p  pMaybe someone can provide relevant configuration snippets for configuration of such an installation. Thanks a lot in advancep

I changed those lines to the code belowp  precode Application.Workbooks.Open pathTestDestination.xlsx  Me.ContactCompany.RowSource  test.CompanyList     WindowsTestDestination.xlsx.Visible  FalseAlso tried activewindow.visible  false codepre  pThis does work to hide the workbook, but for whatever reason renders the named range test.CompanyList unusable by the input workbook and returns an out of range error. The only solution I was able to find through extensive searching suggested that maybe it was due to it adding [hidden] to the filename, therefore creating a miscommunication if I understood correctly. To try to circumvent this I inserted this line immediately after it is openedp  precodeActiveWindow.Caption  TestDestination  codepre  pNo dice. I apologize if this is an obvious solution or if I am not explaining well, I do not know VBA at all I am just learning as I go for a work assignment. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 8945 pTheres a workflow based on states. The workflow is linear. Each state dictates an action to take. An action can only happen if a state for that action exists. I know I can code this verbosely with a series of if else statements. However that seems overkill and I want to try to reduce that by doing the followingp  precodepublic static void DoWorkFlowActionStateAndActionToTake stateAction                   var state  GetState              if state  stateAction.State                              AnnounceCurrentStatestateAction.State                  try                                      stateAction.Action.Invoke                                                          catch                                      ResetState                     throw                                        PostNextState       codepre  pI pass in a state and its attendant action. Then find the workflow stage were supposed to do next. Then let everyone know whats happening now. Then perform that action. If theres an error the reset state back to what it was at the beginning of this and throw. And at the end Set workflow to next state.p  pTo call the workflow, I would just call this method in workflow order with stateActionp  precodeDoWorkFlowActionstateAction1 DoWorkFlowActionstateAction2 DoWorkFlowActionstateAction3 DoWorkFlowActionstateAction4 codepre  pAgain, I could do this with if elses explicitly, but thought this might be more elegant and simpler to read and follow.

Negative 8945 pIm gettings lots of codexmlcode file from several content delivery systems. They are not related to each other.p  pCurrently I parse each xml to codejavacode objects codeEntitycode, and persist them in a codepostgrescode db.p  pProblem when a user wants to access the stored data, the objects are recomposed from the db rows. The root element is always identified by a unique id, and contained data is joined from the different rows.p  pSo in general, Im repeating the procedure read xml  decompose to java object  store in db in different tables  user access  fetch from db and join the table rows  compose to java object  deliver to user interface by REST or SOAP.p  pThe content is always accessed from the root. Eg a product is accessed by product id. All the subcontent like descriptions, stock, price etc is never accessed directly, but always only by the root product.p  pQuestion wouldnt it be easier to just store the xml codedocumentscode somehow under the unique key, and then the user accesses the content, then only start reading the xml and offer it in a custom format to the userp  pIf yes how could I store the content Of course its probably not suitable to persist the xml files as codeblobscode in the postgres db, but what would be betterp  pUpdatep  precodeltfoogt   ltbarsgt     ltbargtltidgt1ltidgtltcontentgtHelloltcontentgtltbargt     ltbargtltidgt2ltidgtltcontentgtHello2ltcontentgtltbargt   ltbarsgt ltfoogt  Entity public class Foo     Id auto generated    private long id     OneToMany    private ListltBargt bars   Entity public class Bar     private int id    private String concent  codepre  pOf course the real xml files are much more complex, thus the data will be distributed to many tables and rows. Im looking now for a way that I dont have to distribute the full xml content so several tables here one root entry goes to table codefoocode, and two entries go to table codebarcode. Because when I fetch the content on user request, I would have the unique ID of codefoocode and join any content here only the codebarcode content.p  pThe codebarcode content and any other subcontent is never accessed without the parent element. So maybe there are better ways to store these kind of data, as the full data is always accessed topdown and always has be be rejoined.p

How can i make sure that the request from first thread does not overlap with that particular request of second threadp  pI thought of getting the timestamp of first thread in the second thread and make the first one sleep for 50ms before it starts sending the request again.

Negative 8945 pIm a beginner with C and I have the following problem. My idea is I have some possible triggers [codewaterlevelthreshold1code, codewaterlevelthreshold2code]. If codewaterlevelthreshold2code is active codewaterlevelthreshold1code is false [threshold1true means that the water level is between the two values]. Depending on the trigger I want to activate two sounds corresponding to two alarms. The conditions are monitored every few milliseconds and my alarms last some seconds. I need the sounds to be played asynchronously because I dont want to stop the water level monitoring. The water level can of course changes randomly. At the moment, for example for the first threshold, I wrote something likep  precodeif waterlevelthreshold1soundalreadystarted ampamp waterlevelthreshold1      using SoundPlayer player  new SoundPlayerCUsersAntoninoDesktopwaterlevelthreshold1alarm.wav              player.PlayLooping            to avoid the sound to be stuck on its first msecs [sampling time]     waterlevelthreshold1soundalreadystarted  true  codepre  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2916505stoppingasoundplayerloopatthelocallevelAs far as I knowa a SoundPlayer can handle just a tune per time so they will not overlap. And moreover the loop ensures me that the tune will be played until in that state, as I want.

Now in order to make sure that the user is allowed to view the table, both codetable.phpcode and codeserverside.phpcode start the session and check user variables.  This works, but about 1 out of every 15 refreshed of codetable.phpcode will result in all session data being deleted.  Why is this happeningp  pThe same session code works fine with other ajax scripts.  But the tables screws everything up.p  pCould it be because the ajax script is being called at virtually the same time as codetable.phpcodep  pinit and dinit and the code segments below simply are used to instantiate and later unset variables that cannot be serialized like PDO.  dinit also contains codesessionwriteclosecodep  pTable.php looks something like thisp  precodeltphp DefineEXEC,true  includevarwwwprivatecoreAutoLoader.php helpersSessionManagerstartA Name SESSION[User]gtinit  if SESSION[User]gtgetPermissions gt 1      SESSION[User]gtdinit     dieYou must be an admin to access this site  gt  lttable iditems classdisplay cellspacing0 width100gt     lttheadgt         lttrgt             ltthgtIDltthgt             ltthgtNameltthgt             ltthgtDescriptionltthgt             ltthgtViewltthgt         lttrgt     lttheadgt      lttfootgt         lttrgt             ltthgtIDltthgt             ltthgtNameltthgt             ltthgtDescriptionltthgt             ltthgtViewltthgt         lttrgt     lttfootgt  lttablegt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction          items.dataTable             processing true,             serverSide true,             ajax serverside.php,             order [[ 0, desc ]],             lengthMenu [[5, 10, 15, 20, 1], [5, 10, 15, 20, All]],             displayLength 10,             stateSave true,             createdRow function row, data, dataIndex                  if data[3]  1                      row.addClassenabled                  else                      row.addClassdisabled                                             ltscriptgt  ltphp SESSION[User]gtdinit gt codepre  pServerSide.php looks something like thisp  precodeltphp defineEXEC, true  requireoncevarwwwprivatecoreAutoLoader.php  helpersSessionManagerstartA Name SESSION[User]gtinit  if SESSION[User]gtgetPermissions gt 1      SESSION[User]gtdinit     dieYou must be an admin to access this site   class SSP      public static function simplePARAMTERS         This function works, a bunch of code here   echo jsonencode     SSPsimple GET, sqldetails, table, primaryKey, columns   SESSION[User]gtdinit gt codepre  pThe SessionManager Classp  precodeltphp  namespace helpers  use libraryUser      Session Manager to ensure security and make easy functions    author Help from httpblog.teamtreehouse.comhowtocreatebulletproofsessions  class SessionManager               Session start function        param limit time to maintain session        param path the path under the domain for which it should work        param secure SLL override          public static function startname,limit  0, path  , secure  null           Run sessionstart Wrapper         selfsessionStartname,limit,path,secure          if selfisSessionStarted              echo NEW             selfdestroySession             selfsessionStartname,limit,path,secure             selfcreateNewUser          else if rand1,100 lt 5              sessionregenerateid                   printrSESSION                   Create the new session for this user          private static function createNewUser          SESSION  []         SESSION[User]  new libraryUserSERVER[REMOTEADDR],SERVER[HTTPUSERAGENT]                   Session Start Wrapper to define cookie paramters        param limit time to maintain session        param path the path under the domain for which it should work        param secure SLL override          private static function sessionStartname,limit  0, path  , secure  null           Set the name of the Session         sessionnamename           Set domain name for cookie to work under         domain  SERVER[SERVERNAME]         Parent Domain Modification         domain  explode., domain         domain  . . domain[countdomain  2] . . . domain[countdomain  1]           Set the default secure value to whether the site is being accessed with SSL         https  issetsecure  secure  issetSERVER[HTTPS]           Set the cookie settings and start the session         sessionsetcookieparamslimit, path, domain, https, true         sessionstart                   Destroy the session          public static function destroySession          SESSION[]  []         sessiondestroy                   return Boolean value of it the session has proper variables          private static function isSessionStarted          return issetSESSION[User] ampamp SESSION[User] instanceof User       gt codepre  pstrongEDITstrong  Adding codeasync falsecode did not help.p

Negative 8945 pIm using springtest with springboot in a small Scala application. Apologies for the long introshort questionp  pSo far, everything has worked out fine until I decided to modify one of the endpoints to support streaming. To do this, I added the codeHttpServletResponsecode object to my request handler and copy the source data using Apache Commons codeIOUtils.copycode.p  precodeRequestMappingvalue  Arrayhello, method  ArrayRequestMethod.GET def retrieveFileForVersionresponseHttpServletResponse       val is  getAnInputStream     val os  response.getOutputStream     try        IOUtils.copyis, os      finally        IOUtils.closeQuietlyis       os.flush       IOUtils.closeQuietlyos          codepre  pThis seems to work rather well. I can retrieve binary data from the endpoint and verify that its MD5 checksum matches the source datas MD5 checksum.p  pHowever, I noticed this is no longer the case when using the REST controller in springtests MockMvc. In fact, when the request is performed through MockMvc, the response is actually four bytes bigger than usual. Thus, some simple assertions failp  precodeTest def testHello           ... snip ... read the binary file into a byte array     val bytes  IOUtils.toByteArray...      val result  mockMvc.performgethello.andExpectstatus.isOk.andReturn     val responseLength  result.getResponse.getContentAsByteArray.length        TODO  find out why this test fails     assertresponseLength  bytes.length, sResponse size responseLength, file size bytes.length     assertArrays.equalsresult.getResponse.getContentAsByteArray, bytes  codepre  pUsing the debugger, I was able to determine that MockMvc is appending to the response codeOutputStreamcode even though it is already closed using codeIOUtils.closeQuietlycode. In fact, it is appending the return value of the request handler which is the number of bytes in the codeOutputStreamcode from codeIOUtils.closeQuietlycode in fact.p  pWhy is MockMvc appending to the codeOutputStreamcode after its already closed Is this a bug, or am I using the library incorrectlyp

Negative 8945 pMy website has been experiencing a denial of servicehack attack for the last week.  The attack is hitting our web API with randomly generated invalid API keys in a loop.p  pIm not sure if they are trying to guess a key mathematically impossible as 64bit keys or trying to DOS attack the server.  The attack is distributed, so I cannot ban all of the IP address, as it occurs from hundreds of clients.p  pMy guess is that it is an Android app by the IPs, so someone has some malware in an Android app, and use all the installs to attack my server.p  pServer is TomcatJava, currently the web API just responds 400 to invalid keys, and caches IPs that have made several invalid key attempts, but still needs to do some processing for each bad request.p  pAny suggestions how to stop the attack  Is there any way to identify the Android app making the request from the HTTP headerp
