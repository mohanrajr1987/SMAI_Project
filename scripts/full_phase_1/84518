Positive 84518 pFirst a little background on what I want to achieve. I have a service that requires some configuration before it gets injected and used.

I see a lot of examples on how to architect an enterprise ntier app in C but not that many on architecting standalone desktop apps.p

Negative 84518 pThe answer to this question may turn out to be, Dont use typed DataSets without using the Binding Navigator. I am curious, however, about the behavior Im seeing.p  pSo, I created a form where every control was dragged from the data sources explorer. I deleted the Binding Navigator because it is ugly and inappropriate for this particular form. I added a ListBox and set the DataSource to the BindingSource.br  Notice that the ListBox is not bound, it is just filling itself from the BindingSource. By some magic that I wasnt counting on, moving around in the ListBox is navigating the BindingSource and all other controls are updating accordingly.p  pI can make changes to the bound controls and explicitly call EndEdit on the BindingSource and then update the DataSource through the Table Adapter.  Works great.p  pWhen I make changes in the bound controls and click a new option in the ListBox, I want to be able to check for changes and prompt to save or reset if there are any.p  pHere is the strange part that I havent been able to figure out.p  pNo matter what event I attach to, DataSet.HasChanges doesnt return true until the second ListBox change. Ive searched and tried dozens of suggestions, most of them ridiculous, but a few that seemed promising. No luck.p  pEdit It isnt the second click that is significant, it is when you click back on the original edited item.p

Negative 84518 pIve created a WPF control inheriting from FrameworkElement that displays a tiled graphic that can be panned. Each tile is 256x256 pixels at 24bpp. Ive overridden OnRender. There, I load any new tiles as BitmapFrame, then draw all visible tiles using drawingContext.DrawImage.p  pNow, whenever there are more than a handful new tiles per render cycle, the framerate drops from 60fps to zero for about a second. This is not caused by loading the images which takes in the order of milliseconds, nor by DrawImage which takes no time at all, as it merely fills some intermediate render data structure.p  pMy guess is that the render thread itself chokes whenever it gets a large number 20 of new BitmapSource instances that is, ones it had not already cached. Either it spends a lot of time converting them to some internal DirectXcompatible format or it might be a caching issue. It cannot be running out of video RAM Perforator shows peaks at below 60MB, I have 256MB. Also, Perforator says all render targets are hardwareaccelerated, so that cant be it, either.p  pAny insights would be appreciatedp  pThanks in advancep  pDanielp  pRandomEngybr BitmapScalingMode.LowQuality reduced the problem a little, but did not get rid of it. I am already loading tiles at the intended resolution. And it cant be the graphics driver, which is uptodate Nvidia.br Im a little surprised to learn that scaling takes that much time. The way I understood it, a bitmap regardless of its size is just loaded as a Direct3D texture and then hardwarescaled. As a matter of fact, once the bitmap has been rendered for the first time, I can change its rotation and scale without any further freezes.p

Negative 84518 pI am writing refactoring a Silverlight program to consumes a portion of its existing business logic from a WCF service. In doing so, Ive run into the restriction in Silverlight 3 that only allows asynchronous calls to WCF services to avoid cases where longrunning or nonresponsive service calls block the UI thread SL has an interesting queuing model for invoking WCF services on the UI thread.p  pAs a consequence, writing what once was straightforward, is becoming rapidly more complex emsee the code examples at the end of my questionem.p  pIdeally, I would use a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCoroutinecoroutinesa to simplify the implementation, but sadly, C does not currently support coroutines as a native language facility. However, C does have the concept of generators iterators using the codeyield returncode syntax. My idea is to repurpose the yield keyword to allow me to build a simple coroutine model for the same logic.p  pI am reluctant to do this, however, because I am worried that there may be some hidden technical pitfalls that Im not anticipating given my relative inexperience with Silverlight and WCF. I am also worried that the implementation mechanism may not be clear to future developers and may hinder rather than simplify their efforts to maintain or extend the code in the future. Ive seen this question on SO about repurposing iterators to build state machines a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1194853implementingastatemachineusingtheyieldkeywordhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1194853implementingastatemachineusingtheyieldkeyworda, and while its not exactly the same thing Im doing, it does make me pause.p  pHowever, I need to do something to hide the complexity of the service calls and manage the effort and potential risk of defects in this type of change. I am open to other ideas or approaches I can use to solve this problem.p  pThe original nonWCF version of the code looks something like thisp  precodevoid ButtonClicked object sender, EventArgs e      using var bizLogic  new BusinessLogicLayer          try              var resultFoo  bizLogic.Foo             ... do something with resultFoo and the UI            var resultBar  bizLogic.BarresultFoo             ... do something with resultBar and the UI            var resultBaz  bizLogic.BazresultBar             ... do something with resultFoo, resultBar, resultBaz              codepre  pThe refactored WCF version becomes quite a bit more involved even without exception handling and prepost condition testingp  precode fields needed to manage distributedasync state private FooResponse mResultFoo   private BarResponse mResultBar private BazResponse mResultBaz private SomeServiceClient mService  void ButtonClicked object sender, EventArgs e       this.IsEnabled  false  disable the UI while processing async WECF call chain     mService  new SomeServiceClient     mService.FooCompleted  OnFooCompleted     mService.BeginFoo    called asynchronously by SL when service responds void OnFooCompleted FooResponse fr       mResultFoo  fr.Response      do some UI processing with resultFoo     mService.BarCompleted  OnBarCompleted     mService.BeginBar   void OnBarCompleted BarResponse br       mResultBar  br.Response      do some processing with resultBar     mService.BazCompleted  OnBazCompleted     mService.BeginBaz    void OnBazCompleted BazResponse bz       mResultBaz  bz.Response      ... do some processing with FooBarBaz results     mService.Dispose  codepre  pThe above code is obviously a simplification, in that it omits exception handling, nullity checks, and other practices that would be necessary in production code. Nonetheless, I think it demonstrates the rapid increase in complexity that begins to occur with the asynchronous WCF programming model in Silverlight. Refactoring the original implementation which didnt use a service layer, but rather had its logic embedded in the SL client is rapidly looking to be a daunting task. And one that is likely to be quite error prone.p  pThe coroutine version of the code would look something like this I have not tested this yetp  precodevoid ButtonClicked object sender, EventArgs e       PerformSteps ButtonClickCoRoutine    private IEnumerableltActiongt ButtonClickCoRoutine      using var service  new SomeServiceClient           FooResponse resultFoo         BarResponse resultBar         BazResponse resultBaz          yield return  gt              service.FooCompleted  r gt NextStep r, out resultFoo              service.BeginFoo                  yield return  gt               do some UI stuff with resultFoo             service.BarCompleted  r gt NextStep r, out resultBar              service.BeginBar                  yield return  gt               do some UI stuff with resultBar             service.BazCompleted  r gt NextStep r, out resultBaz              service.BeginBaz                  yield return  gt               do some processing with resultFoo, resultBar, resultBaz                 private void NextStepltTgt T result, out T store        store  result     PerformSteps   continues iterating steps   private IEnumerableltActiongt mStepsToPerform private void PerformSteps IEnumerableltActiongt steps      mStepsToPerform  steps    PerformSteps           private void PerformSteps     if mStepsToPerform  null          return  nothing to do     mStepsToPerform.MoveNext    var nextStep  mStepsToPerform.Current    if nextStep  null          mStepsToPerform.Dispose        mStepsToPerform  null        return  end of steps        nextStep  codepre  pThere are all sorts of things that need to be improved in the above code. But the basic premise is to factor out the continuation pattern creating an interception point for exception handling and various checks while allowing the eventbased async model of WCF to drive when each step is performed  basically when the last async WCF call completes. While on the surface this looks like more code, its worth mentioning that codePerformStepscode and codeNextStepcode are reusable, only the implementation in codeButtonClickCoRoutinecode would change with each different implementation site.p  pIm not entirely sure I like this model, and I wouldnt be surprised if a simpler way existed to implement it. But I havent been able to find one on the interwebs or MSDN, or anywhere else. Thanks in advance for the help.p

Negative 84518 pIm trying to add paths to my classpath in the Clojure REPL that Ive set up in Emacs using ELPA. Apparently, this isnt the CLASSPATH environment variable, but rather the swankclojureclasspath variable that Swank sets up.

Unfortunately, I cant figure out how to change the classpath now.p  pIve tried using setq swankclojureextraclasspaths list ... both before and after the ELPA stuff in my .emacs, and Ive tried adding paths directly to swankclojureclasspath in .emacs, .emacs.dinit.el, and .emacs.duseruser.el, but nothing works.p  pWhat Im ultimately trying to do is to add both the current directory . and the directory in which I keep my Clojure programs.

Negative 84518 pI am interfacing with a hardware device that streams data to my app over Wifi. The data is streaming in just fine. The data contains a character header DATA that indicates a new record has begun. The issues is that the data I receive doesnt necessarily fall on the header boundary, so I have to capture the data until what Ive captured contains the header.

Negative 84518 pI have been reading the Garbage Collection chapter from Jeffrey Richters fine book, CLR via C. There, he illustrated an example of how the GC conceptually works how roots are marked by referring to a disassembly listing of native code emitted from the JIT compiler. From that example, it occurred to me that nesting reference types in scope seems to have ZERO effect on expediting the garbage collection of the nested variable. I wonder if I am understanding this correctly. In any case, consider these 2 versions of codep  pA Nesting a reference type variable y in an inner scopep  precodenamespace scope      class A  public void foo        class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      A x  new A             x.foo                              A y  new A                 y.foo                             codepre  pB Same as above, except that x and y are in the same scope.p  precodenamespace scope      class A  public void foo        class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      A x  new A             x.foo              A y  new A             y.foo                codepre  pOut of curiosity, I checked the generated IL code for both versions, and they are the SAME p  pQ1 So, this seems to imply that indeed, scoping doesnt expedite garbage collection in any way. Is this correct Note I know about the using statement  but Im only curious about the behaviour on the GC of plain old scoping as illustrated in the 2 examples above.p  pQ2 If the answer to Q1 is True, then I am utterly perplexed by how a Object Lifetime is Not Determined by Scope situation can possibly happen, as described here a hrefhttpwww.curlybrace.comfavorite.html relnofollowhttpwww.curlybrace.comfavorite.htmlap

For now I extracted getter to a Get method and I use this method when I need the getter function.p  pFew words about background I have class A with properties and I have another class T which keeps track of some properties from A and from class B, C, etc.. Keeping track means here that when object of T is asked about current values of tracked properties it should give such.p  pOne approach could be change notification mechanism, but class A does not know what is tracked or not  so it is quite wrong approach. You have to rewrite all classes that strongmightstrong be tracked. Moreover notifications have to be send all the time, even if tracker wont be asked about values at all.p  pIt seems more handy to simply pass a method how to read the value getter of property and tracker will use it when required. No overhead, pretty straightforward.p

Negative 84518 pthanks for taking the time to read this.p  pI have a JavaScript jQuery navigation bar on my main page that is simply included on my page.  For example, I have index.shtml that includes the nav bar, which is navbar.shtml.  And this is the same for every other page.  Now clearly, with the current setup, theres no way to show the user which menu item is currently selected since the navbar.shtml page stays static. p  pWhat Im wanting to do is STILL have just the one navbar.shtml file, but be able to, on the individual pages, show the user the current menu item selected on the nav bar as in a different shade of color, etc..  If navbar.shtml stays static, theres not a very clear way to do this.  Is there a workaround to this if I dont want to instantiate an entirely new Javascript nav bar on each and every page  Or would each page need its own version of the navbar code specific to that page so it knows which item it needs to shadep

Negative 84518 pOk so Ill be honest, I have a good amount of experience with phpmysql, Ive just started learning jQuery and Ive done very little, but some with ajax. So using the terms ajaxjquery interchangeably are a bit confusing to me. Anyway as the title suggest I have a website with 5 items, and I want them to move meaning, if a more recent one is entered, remove the last item, and put the new one on top, they are 5 of the most recent items in the database table, now Ive coded jquery as a test so it fades out the last one, the whole thing moves down, makes room at the top, and fades in a new one. However, its a test and has 0 interaction with the database, the one that fades in is just in a hidden div. So the jQuery part is taken care of.p  pSo Im unsure how to go about this, I was thinking maybe have ajax check a website off the page that has those 5 items in raw format, and if they change then to refresh p  pNot looking for a plz code 4 me answer, just the concept of how it would work, or some links to get off to the right start.p  pedit  Also, the 5 items are ranked, so if I click item 3 I need it to move above item 2 refreshlessly, so this causes a whole other issue I assume.p

Negative 84518 pIve got an update panel with a repeater and some fields. When a user fills out the details on the fields it populates a collection I keep in the Viewstate which is then bound to the repeater.p  pSo the updatepanel updates and the repeater now contains the new item the values for which the user just filled out in the form.p  pIve also got an edit button as part of that repeater which, when clicked, populates the form fields with the data the user initially entered.p  pWhat I want to do then is for the user to be able to edit this data and save the item, but instead of it being added to the collection  viewstate it edits whatever item the user had chosen and updates the collection  viewstate to reflect that.p  pFor example, imagine a form with two fieldsp  pName Agep  pI enter Bob and 46 and hit save. p  pRepeater now shows an entry for Bob 46 with an edit button beside it. User clicks on the edit button and the form fields are populated with Bob and 46 again.p  pUser then changes it to Bob Age 47 and hits save. Now instead of there then being two entries Bob 46 and Bob 47  the bob 46 one would be updated to Bob 47.p  pHope this is clear, Its a little obscure but I think Ive explained the gist of it. Important thing to remember is that this is all happening in the update panel so Im using Viewstate to contain the collection that populates the repeater.p

I have internet explorer installed on the server and making the same request in IE, as opposed to my app, the page is loaded in a similar time as it is on my workstation.p  pThe code is as followsp  precodeprivate static XElement FetchXmlstring uri      int retryInterval  500      for int retry  1 retry lt RETRYMAX retry              Stopwatch stopWatch  Stopwatch.StartNew          try                      var request  HttpWebRequest.Createuri              request.Proxy  new WebProxyltthe corporate proxygt, 8080               3 minute timeout on individual web requests             request.Timeout  1000  60  3              using var response  request.GetResponse                              using var stream  response.GetResponseStream                                      using var reader  new StreamReaderstream                                              XElement xml  XElement.Loadreader                         log.InfoFormatFetched Uri0, Size1 bytes, Elapsed2N2s., uri, xml.ToString.Length, stopWatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds                         return xml                                                                     catch Exception ex                      log.ErrorFormatError fetching Xml Uri0  1, uri, ex.Message                  log.InfoFormatRetrying fetch after interval Attempt0, Interval1s,           retry, doubleretryInterval1000          System.Threading.Thread.SleepretryInterval           Back off for next retry if it occurs.         retryInterval  2           string msg  String.FormatError fetching Xml  exhausted maximum retries Uri0, MaxRetries1.,         uri,         RETRYMAX           throw new ApplicationExceptionmsg  codepre  pI have tested all of the following having spent yesterday researching the issuep  precodeServicePointManager.CheckCertificateRevocationList  false ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit  65000 ServicePointManager.Expect100Continue  false codepre  pNone of these helped. Ive also seen it suggested that the proxy can cause these problems and can be bypassed, unfortunately not in this environment, and I don think it can be the proxies fault as I use the same one on my workstation.p  pI have also grabbed some Microsoft Network Monitor traces and interestingly, the packet size on the server coming from the remote site to my app is much smaller. On my workstation they are approx 1400 bytes, whereas on the server they are more like 300 bytes, and whilst Im not too familiar with TCP it seems there is a lot of chatter getting the http continuations to build the full message. So whereas on my workstation its about 4 inbound messages for the total payload with 3 outbound, on the server it is 19 inbound messages with similar number of outbound. This probably explains the performance problem, but I dont understand why it is happening. When I load the page in IE on the server its a small number of requests with big packet sizes.p  pNetwork Monitor on my XP Workstationp  precodeHTTPRequest, GET httpxml.vendor.comdatapage,

Negative 84518 pI wrote the following code to build a basic game that makes two cars race randomgenerator and let the user pick their bets on the end results.

Negative 84518 pIm in the process of completely redesigningredeveloping our corporate website, and am about to set up the skeleton in VS2010 and TFS, as well as get things prepped in our DEV and QA environments. Our company has some separate business units that either handle a certain business focus or are businesses weve taken over that are not or will not fall under our corporate name and main domain.p  pThe overall idea behind the redesign is to unify the look and feel of all the sites, with a few exceptions for individuality such as logos and certain design elements like header backgrounds that will reflect the corporate colors of those units. Otherwise, all other design resources such as icons, etc. as well as most JavaScript and BL most likely via web services will be shared. Id like to set things up such that I do not need to push resources to multiple sites. One place for all sites to get their resources.p  pALL of that said How should this project be set up in Visual Studio, and by extension, IIS7 I need to account for not only our main corporate domain, but the other business units, which may either have their own domain, or just a subdomain.p  pMy first thought is to set up AppThemes, Scripts and a Web Services folder for the shared resources. Then each domainsubdomain goes into its own folder in the same Project, and those domainsubdomain folders are set up as Virtual Directories in IIS. Does this sound like the best way to go, or will that create problems, or ultimately not be the right solutionp  pUpdatep  pSo far, not so good. Ive set up a solution with one project. That project has multiple folders, one for each site as well as a folder for scripts, images, and css. Each folder has been set up as a Virtual in IIS. I have a default.aspx page that uses a masterpage in the root of the project. That actually works fine. However, any script or css references do not. Which, logically, makes sense.p  pHow do I get around this Am I approaching this the wrong wayp

Negative 84518 pOur company is having a problem migrating from a single user application to multiple. Our setup is that a User would own a Product, and that ownership is through a foreign key. Since they owned the Product they would have permission to perform all functions on the Product. If you dont own the Product and werent an Admin, then you could not access the Product or any of its functions.p  pNow we are trying to open the access to the Products up to other users who have been Grouped together with the respective owner, to collaborate. These other users including the owner may have limited functionality based on a set of permissions. The scope of the permissions have been designed to be based on p  ol lithe Person to Product ownership relationship FKli lithe Person to Product relationship via a PersonProduct bridge tableli lithe Person to Group to Product relationship where a Product belongs to one and only one Groupli lithe Person to Organisation Applicantion Wide Permissions which is the users default permissions if the permissions via the other relationships are not declared.li ol  pThese relationships have already been implemented but problems have come up where the system is doing alot of calculations based on Relationships. e.g. Getting the Users permissions for a collection of Products has significantly hindered performance.

When my ProxySelector is destroyed these reference points nowhere thus causing the JVM to have no valid ProxySelector. The best solution I came up was to clone the selector. But ProxySelector does not have a codeclonecode method. Casting the codedefaultSelectorcode to some default implementation emsun.net.spi.DefaultProxySelectorem might not be the best solution but could work. It could be a problem because it could override other custom implementations that have been set before.p  pstrongSo what is your best practice for thisstrongp

Negative 84518 pSoo... I have a web app im working on.  Heres the basics. ASP.Net, C, EF, Linqp  pWe have Projects which have and open and close date.p  pSo imagine a table called projects with those fields. On that table we want a computed column for Time Open and Adjusted time open where Adjusted Time Open takes into account hours of operation.p  pright now you can set hours of operation from Sunday  Saturday or select that the day is not worked.p  pThis is stored in a table and the values are stored as minutes from midnight, in UTC.p  pEverything in our db as far as dates is stored in utc.p  pSo in the user defined function that calculates time open and adjusted time open which are written and work, except for situations with daylight savings time.p  pFor examplep  pWe create a project where were ahead one hour at 9am our local time. so that gets stored as 220000 UTC.  If we create a project when were back one our at 9am our local time, that gets stored as 210000 UTC.  Im kinda guessing at the exact times, but you get the point.p  pThis is fine, I have no problems with this.  The problem comes in with hours of operation.p  pWe basically when they set it, get the utc time and then convert that to minutes from midnight and store that in the table.  So technically, that could be 22  60 or 21  60 depending on which part of daylight savings time were in.  So the calculations could be off.p  pIs this making sense  I have a hard time grasping and explaining some of this stuff.p

I simply forgot some of the properties when defining my models.

As you can see in the controller of the sample project Im linking to in the end of this post, Im still able to cycle all the way around and do stuff like codemothers.First.Family.Fathers.First.Children.First.Mother.Family.Namecode without any problems. But all tutorials and examples about EF and Code First modeling Ive been looking at e.g. a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20100716codefirstdevelopmentwithentityframework4.aspxthis one by Scott Guthriea include these properties, so it feels wrong not to use them.p  pstrongAnd so, my second question isstrong Will there be any drawbacks and problems I havent discovered yet doing thisp  pDownload example project here a hrefhttpblackfin.cannedtuna.orgcyclicalreferencetestapp.ziphttpblackfin.cannedtuna.orgcyclicalreferencetestapp.zipa, and open TestSolution.sln.

Negative 84518 pMy question is this how can I determine when it is safe to disable cache snooping when I am correctly using code[pci]dmasyncsingleforcpu,devicecode in my device driverp  pIm working on a device driver for a device which writes directly to RAM over PCI Express DMA, and am concerned about managing cache coherence.  There is a control bit I can set when initiating DMA to enable or disable cache snooping during DMA, clearly for performance I would like to leave cache snooping disabled if at all possible.p  pIn the interrupt routine I call codepcidmasyncsingleforcpucode and code...fordevicecode as appropriate, when switching DMA buffers, but on 32bit Linux 2.6.18 RHEL 5 it turns out that these commands are macros which expand to nothing ... which explains why my device returns garbage when cache snooping is disabled on this kernelp  pIve trawled through the history of the kernel sources, and it seems that up until 2.6.25 only 64bit x86 had hooks for DMA synchronisation.  From 2.6.26 there seems to be a generic unified indirection mechanism for DMA synchronisation currently in codeincludeasmgenericdmamappingcommon.hcode via fields codesyncsingleforcpu,devicecode of codedmamapopscode, but so far Ive failed to find any definitions of these operations.p

Then i tried to close and reopen the app again, which will then make a new instance of the get http request, but still, the response still is the same as the very first one and doesnt contain the new data that was added to the db server.

Negative 84518 pI understand what immutability is, and how the String .NET class is special. The immutability makes it behave like a value type even though its a reference type. Got it. The C reference emphasizes this point see a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary362314fe.aspx relnofollowstring C Referencea, emphasis added by mep  blockquote   pStrings are immutablethe contents of a string object cannot be changed after the object is created, although the syntax makes it appear as if you can do this. For example, when you write this code, the strongcompiler actually creates a new string object to hold the new sequence of characters, and that new object is assigned to b. The string h is then eligible for garbage collection.strongp blockquote  pBeing a selftaught programmer Im not well versed in garbage collectors and memory leaks and pointers and stuff. Thats why Im asking a question about it. The description of how the C compiler automatically creates new string objects and abandons old ones makes it seem like a bunch of memory could get used up with abandoned string content. A lot of objects have dispose methods or destructors so that even the automated CLR garbage collector knows when and how to clean up after an object that isnt needed anymore. There is nothing like this for a String. I wanted to see what would actually happen if a created a program so that I could demostrate for myself and others that creating and immediately abandoning string objects can consume a lot of memory.p  pHeres the program p  precodeclass Program      static void Mainstring[] args              Console.ReadKey         int megaByte  intMath.Pow1024, 2         string[] hog  new string[2048]         char c         for int i  0 i lt 2048 i                      c  Convert.ToChari             Console.WriteLineGenerating iteration 0 char  1, i, c             hog[i]  new stringc, megaByte             if i  1  256  0                   for int j  i  255 j lt i j  hog[j]  hog[i]                        Console.ReadKey          Listltstringgt uniqueStrings  new Listltstringgt         for int i  0 i lt 2048 i              if uniqueStrings.Containshog[i]  uniqueStrings.Addhog[i]                   Console.WriteLineThere are 0 unique strings in hog., uniqueStrings.Count         Console.ReadKey           Create a timer with an interval of 30 minutes           30 minutes  60 seconds  1000 milliseconds         System.Timers.Timer t  new System.Timers.Timer30  60  1000         t.Elapsed  new System.Timers.ElapsedEventHandlertElapsed         t.Start         Console.WriteLineWaiting 30 minutes...          Console.ReadKey           static void tElapsedobject sender, System.Timers.ElapsedEventArgs e              Console.WriteLineTimes up. Im collecting the garbage.         GC.Collect       codepre  pIt creates a destroys bunch of unique strings and only ends up with 8 unique strings in the hog array. In my tests the process was still holding on to 570 Mb to 1.1 Gb it varied. The timer part waits 30 minutes while leaving the process active not sleeping and at the end of 30 minutes, the process was emstillem holding on to all the extra memory until I forced collection. This makes it seem like the .NET garbage collector missed something. Lots of other places people say that calling GC.Collect is something terrible. So the fact that the memory only seems to get reclaimed by forcing the collector using this method still makes it seem like something is wrong.p

Ive tried to do codeserveroffset  date.isDST  4  5  60code instead but I havent found any solution for capturing codeisDSTcode which works fine for all the local client timezones. Most of them work fine for that local browsers timezone which has the same value of DST as EST timezone but would fail in the case of GMT530 timezone for example.p  pSo are there any way to determine whether DST would be applied for some specific date in EST timezone from javascriptp  pOr maybe Ive missed somethingp
Negative 84518 pIm planning a multicountry site. I will be using a subdomain for each country, for examplep  blockquote   puk.example.com UKbr       us.example.com USAbr       ca.example.com Canadap blockquote  pEach country will have sections, but not all the countries will have all the sections.p  pSo for example, the UK site will have available 3 sections, the US site will have 5 sections and the CA sill have all the available sections suppose there are 8 sections.p  pI need in some way to turn sections ON and OFF in each subdomain and in interior pages change options for example in UK I have to show a different money symbol and maybe use a different text. p  pApart of that, I need to use some kind of parameter according the subdomain used the info is in the same database, so if the subdomain is UK I need to retrieve only the info for UK.p  pThe easy way would be to replicate in each subdomain the code behind, but I dont want to do it this way, because when I change something in the code, I would have to replicate for all the others subdomains.p  pIm using C.p  pAny suggestions and help are much appreciated p

Negative 84518 pI am trying to use a codeListBoxcode to display a possibly infinite list of options to a user. Currently, I am simply cutting off the list at an arbitrary point, but I would like to allow the user to scroll down as far as they want. Also, I want to avoid generating nonvisible items as much as possible as some computation has to be done to generate each item.p  pI tried writing codelistBox.ItemsSource  enumerablecode expecting it to only ask the enumerable for visible items, but instead it tries to read all of the items which causes an infinite loop if there are infinitely many items.p  pMy best idea is add a listener that gets notified whenever the codeListBoxcode scrolls down and add new items such that there are always codekcode more items after the last item visible where codekcode is probably the number of items visible at a time so Page Down works.p  pIs there some cleaner way to handle thisp

Negative 84518 pSometimes when reading a socket from the codeTcpClient classcode, the stream comes in without interpreting the data instantly.

Negative 84518 pOne day I have decided to test my java skills by building a simple chess game. It took me some time and after a while I finished it. Now the problem starts here I wanted to send my friends my game so I created a runnable jar file through Eclipse. Surprisingly the game inside the runnable jar file showed some strange behaviors like Pieces appearing where they shouldnt appear and some other weird bugs, but without any exceptions. I was even more surprised when I realized that when I run the project inside Eclipse itself everything works like it should. I also tried to create a normal jar file through Eclipse and run it, but I got the following NPE errorp  precode010512 194730.433 [0x00x54054].com.apple.JarLauncher Exception in thread main   010512 194730.498 [0x00x54054].com.apple.JarLauncher java.lang.NullPointerException  010512 194730.498 [0x00x54054].com.apple.JarLauncher  at sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.getMainClassFromJarLauncherHelper.java399  010512 194730.498 [0x00x54054].com.apple.JarLauncher  at sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMainLauncherHelper.java463 codepre  pI have already posted one question about this on this website, but I didnt get a proper answer so I am posting also this question.

Negative 84518 pThis is in my top 10 list of tiny annoying things in Linux.

Negative 84518 pI am currently hung with a problem when developing on my Android virtual machine emulator, Android 2.1. Its not so much about solving the problem but about understanding. What I have is this methodp  precodeprivate void storeDataint crmValue, int crmTouch, int heartrate       Store in data or ring buffer     waitCRM.addcrmValue     waitTouch.addcrmTouch     waitHeart.addheartrate  codepre  pwait are instance variables of the userdefined class RingBuffer. The add method of this class goes like thisp  precodepublic void addE o      buffer.setindex, o     index     if index  capacity          index  0          if length lt capacity          length       codepre  pE in this case is an Integer, the buffer is an ArrayList, the capacity is 60 and the index is 0 because this is the first add call.p  pOf course the ArrayListbuffer is empty at this point and buffer.set may be incorrect, because this would return the current value. Actually buffer.add does not solve the problem, but that is only a details to solve. Shouldnt bother you for now.p  pThe storeData method is called in a ScheduledFuture a timer each 100 ms atFixedRate. As long as the timer wont call storeData due to an IF everything works as expected. But as soon as storeData is called for the first time...p  p... the program leaves the method storeData during waitCRM.addcrmValuep  p... the timer is cancelled other threads resume workingp  p... and no exception or anything else is found in the Console or the LogCatp  pGiven no error message it cost me hours just to find out so much. So here is my question How and under what circumstances will JavaAndroid stop a thread withoud showing any errorp  pThanks for any ideasp

Negative 84518 pThis is my first post on this forum and I hope that I am able to ask my question in the correct way. Sorry for the length, but I found it hard to cut it down.p  pI am using Delphi XE2 to communicate with a fairly large SOAP service. Ive successfully imported the wsdl and everything is working just fine. However, I find myself writing a lot of similar code. I would like to have a generic method that calls my web service. I also find it hard to multithread my code as it is now, since I have to write so much code for each type of call.p  pBeing more of a weekend programmer I am far from mastering the in and outs of Delphi, but I think I at least have a fair understanding of RTTI, which I believe must be used to do what I want.p  pThe web service has about 700 different methods and that is pretty much the problem. The code generated from the wsdl has methods as belowp  precodefunction  addPhoneconst Params addPhone addPhoneResponse stdcall function  updatePhoneconst Params updatePhone updatePhoneResponse stdcall function  getPhoneconst Params getPhone getPhoneResponse stdcall function  removePhoneconst Params removePhone removePhoneResponse stdcall function  listPhoneconst Params listPhone listPhoneResponse stdcall function  addStuffconst Params addStuff addStuffResponse stdcall function  updateStuffconst Params updateStuff updateStuffResponse stdcall ... ... about 700 more of the above codepre  pBasically, there is about 700 different type of things that can be handled, and there is add,update,get,remove and listmethods for them all. With each call, there is a corresponding class that is used as parameters to the SOAP request. There is also a corresponding class for the response as you can see above.p  pThe classes would look something like very simplifiedp  precodeaddStuff  class   private     FStuff string   published     property stuff string  Index ISUNQL read FStuff write FStuff   end codepre  pSo when I call the web service I do for examplep  precodeprocedure CreateStuff var     req    addStuff     res    addStuffResponse     soap   MyWebServicePort begin      Use the function in the wsdlgenerated code to create HTTPRIO     soap  GetMyWebServicePortfalse,,nil      Create Parameter Object     req  addPhone.Create     req.stuff  test      Send the SOAP Request     res  soap.addStuffreq end codepre  pYes, I know I should have try..finally and Free in there as well  p  pThen, somewhere else in the code I need to call a different methodp  precodeprocedure listStuff var     req    listStuff     res    listStuffResponse     soap   MyWebServicePort begin      Use the function in the wsdlgenerated code to create HTTPRIO     soap  GetMyWebServicePortfalse,,nil      Create Parameter Object     req  listPhone.Create     req.stuff  test2      Send the SOAP Request     res  soap.listStuffreq end codepre  pSince I know that the parameter is always a class with a name that is equivalent of the method I call, I would like to be able to do something like the metacode below in order to dynamically invoking the call. I guess it requires some RTTI magic but I havent been able to find a way to do itp  precodeprocedure soapRequestParam Something var Response Something begin   soap  GetMyWebServicePortfalse,,nil   Response  soap.DynamicInvokeParam.ClassName, Param end codepre  pThen I could do something likep  precodesoapRequestVarOfTypeAddStuff,VarOfTypeAddStuffResponse soapRequestVarOfTypeListStuff,VarOfTypeListStuffResponse ... codepre  pDoes anyone have an idea how my calls to the webservice can be simplifiedp  pThanks in advancep  pDanp

Negative 84518 pIve written a RESTful web service which is consumed only by devices, never browsers.  The devices access the internet via the owners existing household router and communicate with the web service by sending HTTP requests through the router as often as every 30 seconds.  These requests are mostly polling requests to see if the web service has any new information for the device.p  pI want to prevent any ISP transparent proxies from intercepting the request and returning a cached response.  Ive read that one way to do this is to append a random query string onto the end of the URL of the request to fool the proxy into thinking its a unique request.

This is because the primary key column is a GUID instead of an int.p  pHow can I drop the default index if I dont know its name or how can I specify a name for the primary key column index so I can drop it Or better yet, how can I specify the 2 index i need right in the Create Table statementp

Lets suppose my key is xxx the same code xxx should not work for any other person who has downloaded my application. Just to make the software to be used only by genuine users.p  pi have also gone through this linkp  pa hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumszhwinformssetupthread301913a0ecf940958d66a3f4baeea6eb relnofollowhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumszhwinformssetupthread301913a0ecf940958d66a3f4baeea6ebap  pby Danny Statenp  pI still havent met my requirements.p  pFirst of all i thought to get the Ip address of the person who is registering to download my application and based on that i can limit my key to be used only by the person whose ip address would be stored in my database. But i think it would be wrong unnecessary process. And to use my application the persons network cable should have been plugged each and every time. But it wouldnt solve my purpose.p  pSecondly i thought of creating a process of the application pinging to my server or to me.p  pLike initially when the user runs the applicationonline or offline the application should work, but as soon as he connects the network cableplug to network an alert should be provided to my server or to me. And from my side i can make a check if the user is using the key that i have provided to him. If in either way the user is not genuine i should be able to stop him from using my application anymore. From my side i have decided to store the keys inside the database which have been provided by me. And each requested keys in another table. Im not sure if im going the right. But as of now this is the thing that has come into my mind.p  pBut to summarize, in the end i want that a key should be used by only one user. Just to avoid a million different users using my application with a single key.p  pIm not sure with any idea that i have provided.p  pNow is there a way i can achieve thatp

Negative 84518 pIm trying to use codermongodbcode to fetch information from a MongoDB database for further processing in R. However, I have some difficulties to really get started.

Replacing codecode with codecode didnt work either.p  pAnother issue is that the database content is nested, which means I have subtrees, subsubtrees etc. For example, for the entry codefirst.nameJohn, last.nameSmithcode I might have subentries like codeaddress, age, occupationcode, and for occupation again I might have categories as subtrees e.g. years from 2005 to 2012 and for each year I would have an an entry like unemployed, clerk, entrepreneur.

Each group then contains a list of people that have been assigned to this group along with their details.p  precode0..    id   Object ID class id    groupname string unique name for this group e.g. beststudents    members[11]        0..            persid  integer 1            firstname string            surname string            age integer            occupation string        1..            persid  integer 2            firstname string            surname string            age integer            occupation string       and so on until 10.. 1..    id   Object ID class id    groupname string unique name for this group    members[3]        0..            persid  integer 1            firstname string            surname string            age integer            occupation string       and so on until 2..  and many more codepre  pNow lets assume that I am interested in the groups with the names best students and good students, and would like to get surname and occupation for each member of each of these groups as an R object in order to do some plots, stats or whatever.

Negative 84518 pSo here is the opposite to the oft asked how to I render messages to more than one form. I have two forms on one page, and after validation in one form, the summary error if validation fails shows up on both forms below the submit buttons. If the code succeeds in sending the required email the confirmation message also shows up in both forms. They should only show up in the form which was submitted. The message below the inputTexts work as they should.

Negative 84518 pAn array codea[]code contains all of the integers from 0 to N, except one. However, you cannot access an element with a single operation. Instead, you can call codegeti, kcode which returns the kth bit of codea[i]code or you can call codeswapi, jcode which swaps the ith and jth elements of codea[]code. Design a ON algorithm to find the missing integer.  For simplicity, assume N is a power of 2.p

Negative 84518 pIm building a web game in Ruby on Rails and I want most of the game logic to take place on the browser.  The game involves a user answering a question.  I need to embed the answers in the web page since thats where Im putting the code that verifies the user answered the question correctly.  I dont want put the answers in plain text since savvy users can view the source to see the answers, so I figured Id encrypt them using a hash before I embed them in the page.p  pTo do this, I need to first create the hash value for the answer string on my Rails backend, and then when the user answers the question, I need to create the hash value for their answer and compare that hash value with the embedded hash value.  If theyre equal, then they answered the question correctly and I notify my server.p  pHow can I generate a hash value for a string on both my Rails backend and in Javascript on the browser  p  pWould you suggest a better way to hide the answers on my webpagep

Negative 84518 pIn one of my projects, I created multiple codeauto reset eventscode and two threads, the threads use codeWaitForMultipleObjectscode to wait on some events before continuing run, likep  precodeHANDLE  hTerminateEvent  CreateEvent...  auto reset HANDLE  hStateChangedEvent  CreateEvent...  auto reset  void thread1Func      HANDLE  handles[2]   hTerminateEvent, hStateChangedEvent      WaitForMultipleObjects2, handles, FALSEbWaitAll, INFINITE     ...   void thread2Func      HANDLE  handles[2]   hTerminateEvent, hStateChangedEvent      WaitForMultipleObjects2, handles, FALSEbWaitAll, INFINITE     ...  codepre  pI previously thought that once codehTerminateEventcode is singled, both threads will be waken up, but seems that is not true for auto reset events, which one gets waken up is random, and after one wakes up, it reset the codehTerminateEventcode to unsignaled.p  pMy question is how to resolve this by using manual reset event or does there exist any design to solve this problem thanksp

Negative 84518 pI am compiling the code given a hrefhttpdownload.blender.orgsourcechestblender2.03treejpegexample.c relnofollowherea using codelibjpegcode in codeDevC4.9.9.2code. Also I have downloaded all the header and lib file from a hrefhttpwww.ece.sunysb.educvle358f2001jpegwindows.html relnofollowherea. For simplicity, below i am putting the entire source codep  precode   example.c     This file illustrates how to use the IJG code as a subroutine library   to read or write JPEG image files.  You should look at this code in   conjunction with the documentation file libjpeg.doc.     This code will not do anything useful asis, but it may be helpful as a   skeleton for constructing routines that call the JPEG library.       We present these routines in the same coding style used in the JPEG code   ANSI function definitions, etc but you are of course free to code your   routines in a different style if you prefer.    include ltstdio.hgt     Include file for users of JPEG library.   You will need to have included system headers that define at least   the typedefs FILE and sizet before you can include jpeglib.h.   stdio.h is sufficient on ANSIconforming systems.   You may also wish to include jerror.h.    include jpeglib.h     ltsetjmp.hgt is used for the optional error recovery mechanism shown in   the second part of the example.    include ltsetjmp.hgt     JPEG COMPRESSION SAMPLE INTERFACE    This half of the example shows how to feed data into the JPEG compressor.   We present a minimal version that does not worry about refinements such   as error recovery the JPEG code will just exit if it gets an error.        IMAGE DATA FORMATS     The standard input image format is a rectangular array of pixels, with   each pixel having the same number of component values color channels.   Each pixel row is an array of JSAMPLEs which typically are unsigned chars.   If you are working with color data, then the color values for each pixel   must be adjacent in the row for example, R,G,B,R,G,B,R,G,B,... for 24bit   RGB color.     For this example, well assume that this data structure matches the way   our application has stored the image in memory, so we can just pass a   pointer to our image buffer.  In particular, lets say that the image is   RGB color and is described by    extern JSAMPLE  imagebuffer   Points to large array of R,G,Border data  extern int imageheight     Number of rows in image  extern int imagewidth      Number of columns in image       Sample routine for JPEG compression.  We assume that the target file name   and a compression quality factor are passed in.    GLOBALvoid writeJPEGfile char  filename, int quality     This struct contains the JPEG compression parameters and pointers to     working space which is allocated as needed by the JPEG library.     It is possible to have several such structures, representing multiple     compressiondecompression processes, in existence at once.  We refer     to any one struct and its associated working data as a JPEG object.       struct jpegcompressstruct cinfo    This struct represents a JPEG error handler.  It is declared separately     because applications often want to supply a specialized error handler     see the second half of this file for an example.  But here we just     take the easy way out and use the standard error handler, which will     print a message on stderr and call exit if compression fails.     Note that this struct must live as long as the main JPEG parameter     struct, to avoid danglingpointer problems.       struct jpegerrormgr jerr    More stuff    FILE  outfile        target file    JSAMPROW rowpointer[1]   pointer to JSAMPLE row[s]    int rowstride        physical row width in image buffer      Step 1 allocate and initialize JPEG compression object      We have to set up the error handler first, in case the initialization     step fails.  Unlikely, but it could happen if you are out of memory.     This routine fills in the contents of struct jerr, and returns jerrs     address which we place into the link field in cinfo.       cinfo.err  jpegstderrorampjerr    Now we can initialize the JPEG compression object.    jpegcreatecompressampcinfo     Step 2 specify data destination eg, a file     Note steps 2 and 3 can be done in either order.      Here we use the librarysupplied code to send compressed data to a     stdio stream.  You can also write your own code to do something else.     VERY IMPORTANT use b option to fopen if you are on a machine that     requires it in order to write binary files.       if outfile  fopenfilename, wb  NULL      fprintfstderr, cant open sn, filename     exit1      jpegstdiodestampcinfo, outfile     Step 3 set parameters for compression      First we supply a description of the input image.     Four fields of the cinfo struct must be filled in       cinfo.imagewidth  imagewidth   image width and height, in pixels    cinfo.imageheight  imageheight   cinfo.inputcomponents  3         of color components per pixel    cinfo.incolorspace  JCSRGB    colorspace of input image     Now use the librarys routine to set default compression parameters.     You must set at least cinfo.incolorspace before calling this,     since the defaults depend on the source color space.       jpegsetdefaultsampcinfo    Now you can set any nondefault parameters you wish to.     Here we just illustrate the use of quality quantization table scaling       jpegsetqualityampcinfo, quality, TRUE  limit to baselineJPEG values      Step 4 Start compressor      TRUE ensures that we will write a complete interchangeJPEG file.     Pass TRUE unless you are very sure of what youre doing.       jpegstartcompressampcinfo, TRUE     Step 5 while scan lines remain to be written               jpegwritescanlines...      Here we use the librarys state variable cinfo.nextscanline as the     loop counter, so that we dont have to keep track ourselves.     To keep things simple, we pass one scanline per call you can pass     more if you wish, though.       rowstride  imagewidth  3  JSAMPLEs per row in imagebuffer     while cinfo.nextscanline lt cinfo.imageheight       jpegwritescanlines expects an array of pointers to scanlines.       Here the array is only one element long, but you could pass       more than one scanline at a time if thats more convenient.           rowpointer[0]  amp imagebuffer[cinfo.nextscanline  rowstride]     void jpegwritescanlinesampcinfo, rowpointer, 1        Step 6 Finish compression     jpegfinishcompressampcinfo    After finishcompress, we can close the output file.    fcloseoutfile     Step 7 release JPEG compression object      This is an important step since it will release a good deal of memory.    jpegdestroycompressampcinfo     And were done        SOME FINE POINTS     In the above loop, we ignored the return value of jpegwritescanlines,   which is the number of scanlines actually written.  We could get away   with this because we were only relying on the value of cinfo.nextscanline,   which will be incremented correctly.  If you maintain additional loop   variables then you should be careful to increment them properly.   Actually, for output to a stdio stream you neednt worry, because   then jpegwritescanlines will write all the lines passed or else exit   with a fatal error.  Partial writes can only occur if you use a data   destination module that can demand suspension of the compressor.   If you dont know what thats for, you dont need it.     If the compressor requires fullimage buffers for entropycoding   optimization or a multiscan JPEG file, it will create temporary   files for anything that doesnt fit within the maximummemory setting.   Note that temp files are NOT needed if you use the default parameters.   On some systems you may need to set up a signal handler to ensure that   temporary files are deleted if the program is interrupted.  See libjpeg.doc.     Scanlines MUST be supplied in toptobottom order if you want your JPEG   files to be compatible with everyone elses.  If you cannot readily read   your data in that order, youll need an intermediate array to hold the   image.  See rdtarga.c or rdbmp.c for examples of handling bottomtotop   source data using the JPEG codes internal virtualarray mechanisms.       JPEG DECOMPRESSION SAMPLE INTERFACE    This half of the example shows how to read data from the JPEG decompressor.   Its a bit more refined than the above, in that we show     a how to modify the JPEG librarys standard errorreporting behavior     b how to allocate workspace using the librarys memory manager.     Just to make this example a little different from the first one, well   assume that we do not intend to put the whole image into an inmemory   buffer, but to send it linebyline someplace else.  We need a one   scanlinehigh JSAMPLE array as a work buffer, and we will let the JPEG   memory manager allocate it for us.  This approach is actually quite useful   because we dont need to remember to deallocate the buffer separately it   will go away automatically when the JPEG object is cleaned up.        ERROR HANDLING     The JPEG librarys standard error handler jerror.c is divided into   several methods which you can override individually.  This lets you   adjust the behavior without duplicating a lot of code, which you might   have to update with each future release.     Our example here shows how to override the errorexit method so that   control is returned to the librarys caller when a fatal error occurs,   rather than calling exit as the standard errorexit method does.     We use Cs setjmplongjmp facility to return control.  This means that the   routine which calls the JPEG library must first execute a setjmp call to   establish the return point.  We want the replacement errorexit to do a   longjmp.  But we need to make the setjmp buffer accessible to the   errorexit routine.  To do this, we make a private extension of the   standard JPEG error handler object.  If we were using C, wed say we   were making a subclass of the regular error handler.     Heres the extended error handler struct    struct myerrormgr    struct jpegerrormgr pub     public fields     jmpbuf setjmpbuffer     for return to caller    typedef struct myerrormgr  myerrorptr     Heres the routine that will replace the standard errorexit method    METHODDEFvoid myerrorexit jcommonptr cinfo     cinfogterr really points to a myerrormgr struct, so coerce pointer    myerrorptr myerr  myerrorptr cinfogterr     Always display the message.     We could postpone this until after returning, if we chose.    cinfogterrgtoutputmessage cinfo     Return control to the setjmp point    longjmpmyerrgtsetjmpbuffer, 1       Sample routine for JPEG decompression.  We assume that the source file name   is passed in.  We want to return 1 on success, 0 on error.     GLOBALint readJPEGfile char  filename     This struct contains the JPEG decompression parameters and pointers to     working space which is allocated as needed by the JPEG library.       struct jpegdecompressstruct cinfo    We use our private extension JPEG error handler.     Note that this struct must live as long as the main JPEG parameter     struct, to avoid danglingpointer problems.       struct myerrormgr jerr    More stuff    FILE  infile         source file    JSAMPARRAY buffer         Output row buffer    int rowstride        physical row width in output buffer      In this example we want to open the input file before doing anything else,     so that the setjmp error recovery below can assume the file is open.     VERY IMPORTANT use b option to fopen if you are on a machine that     requires it in order to read binary files.        if infile  fopenfilename, rb  NULL      fprintfstderr, cant open sn, filename     return 0        Step 1 allocate and initialize JPEG decompression object      We set up the normal JPEG error routines, then override errorexit.    cinfo.err  jpegstderrorampjerr.pub   jerr.pub.errorexit  myerrorexit    Establish the setjmp return context for myerrorexit to use.    if setjmpjerr.setjmpbuffer       If we get here, the JPEG code has signaled an error.       We need to clean up the JPEG object, close the input file, and return.           jpegdestroydecompressampcinfo     fcloseinfile     return 0       Now we can initialize the JPEG decompression object.    jpegcreatedecompressampcinfo     Step 2 specify data source eg, a file     jpegstdiosrcampcinfo, infile     Step 3 read file parameters with jpegreadheader     void jpegreadheaderampcinfo, TRUE    We can ignore the return value from jpegreadheader since       a suspension is not possible with the stdio data source, and       b we passed TRUE to reject a tablesonly JPEG file as an error.     See libjpeg.doc for more info.         Step 4 set parameters for decompression      In this example, we dont need to change any of the defaults set by     jpegreadheader, so we do nothing here.         Step 5 Start decompressor     void jpegstartdecompressampcinfo    We can ignore the return value since suspension is not possible     with the stdio data source.         We may need to do some setup of our own at this point before reading     the data.  After jpegstartdecompress we have the correct scaled     output image dimensions available, as well as the output colormap     if we asked for color quantization.     In this example, we need to make an output work buffer of the right size.         JSAMPLEs per row in output buffer    rowstride  cinfo.outputwidth  cinfo.outputcomponents    Make a onerowhigh sample array that will go away when done with image    buffer  cinfo.memgtallocsarray         jcommonptr ampcinfo, JPOOLIMAGE, rowstride, 1     Step 6 while scan lines remain to be read               jpegreadscanlines...      Here we use the librarys state variable cinfo.outputscanline as the     loop counter, so that we dont have to keep track ourselves.       while cinfo.outputscanline lt cinfo.outputheight       jpegreadscanlines expects an array of pointers to scanlines.       Here the array is only one element long, but you could ask for       more than one scanline at a time if thats more convenient.           void jpegreadscanlinesampcinfo, buffer, 1      Assume putscanlinesomeplace wants a pointer and sample count.      putscanlinesomeplacebuffer[0], rowstride        Step 7 Finish decompression     void jpegfinishdecompressampcinfo    We can ignore the return value since suspension is not possible     with the stdio data source.         Step 8 Release JPEG decompression object      This is an important step since it will release a good deal of memory.    jpegdestroydecompressampcinfo     After finishdecompress, we can close the input file.     Here we postpone it until after no more JPEG errors are possible,     so as to simplify the setjmp error logic above.  Actually, I dont     think that jpegdestroy can do an error exit, but why assume anything...       fcloseinfile     At this point you may want to check to see whether any corruptdata     warnings occurred test whether jerr.pub.numwarnings is nonzero.         And were done    return 1       SOME FINE POINTS     In the above code, we ignored the return value of jpegreadscanlines,   which is the number of scanlines actually read.  We could get away with   this because we asked for only one line at a time and we werent using   a suspending data source.  See libjpeg.doc for more info.     We cheated a bit by calling allocsarray after jpegstartdecompress   we should have done it beforehand to ensure that the space would be   counted against the JPEG maxmemory setting.  In some systems the above   code would risk an outofmemory error.  However, in general we dont   know the output image dimensions before jpegstartdecompress, unless we   call jpegcalcoutputdimensions.  See libjpeg.doc for more about this.     Scanlines are returned in the same order as they appear in the JPEG file,   which is standardly toptobottom.  If you must emit data bottomtotop,   you can use one of the virtual arrays provided by the JPEG memory manager   to invert the data.  See wrbmp.c for an example.     As with compression, some operating modes may require temporary files.   On some systems you may need to set up a signal handler to ensure that   temporary files are deleted if the program is interrupted.

Negative 84518 pThis has a game development project under itself, but its really about coding and mapping data to other pieces of data.

Basically, the two properties mean that when the item gets consumed, the consumers health goes up by 15 points, and his fatigue does so as well. This, in the background, invokes 2 different methodsp  precodevoid RestoreHealthCharacter Subject, int Amount void RestoreFatigueCharacter Subject, int Amount codepre  pHow would you go about mapping the methods to their infile string counterparts This is what I thought ofp  ol lipEvery time an item gets consumed, a list of strings the events gets passed to an emItem event managerem. The manager parses each string and calls the appropriate methods. Very easy to set up, and since this is not an operation that happens too often, the impact on performance might not be considerable strings will also be tiny max 1015 characters in size, and parsed in On time.pli lipEach stronginventory itemstrong class parses the string events once and only once, on initialization. Each string event gets mapped to its appropriate method via a strongstrong dictionary. This is the most efficient method in terms of performance that I can think of, but it makes it extremely difficult to do other things All of the values in the dictionary would have to be delegates of the same kind. This means I cannot keepp  pema RestoreHealthintemp  pemb SummonMonsterPosition, Countemp  pin the same dictionary, and would have to set a new data structure for each kind of callable method. This is a tremendous amount of work to do.pli ol  pSome ways that came to mind, to improve both methodsp  ol lipI could use some sort of temporary cache inside the emItem event managerem, so that an items strongOnConsumestrong events dont get parsed twice I might hit the same issues as the ones I hit during 2 though, as the cache would have to be a codemapltInventoryItem,Listltdelegategtgtcode.pli lipThe stronghashtablestrong data structure inside the .NET libraries allows     for any kind of object to be a key andor value at any given time     unlike the dictionary. I could use this and map strongstring A to     delegate Xstrong, while also having mapped strongstring B to delegate Ystrong     inside the same structure. Any reasons why I should not do this Can     you foresee any trouble that would be brought by this methodpli ol  pI was also thinking about something in the ways of reflection, but Im not exactly experienced when it comes to it.

Negative 84518 pWhile designing a class that dynamically allocates memory I ran into the following problem regarding memory allocation. I was hoping that some of you might be able to point me in the right direction as to how I should design my class in a better way. My class dynamically allocates memory and therefore also deletes it in its destructor.p  pIn order to illustrate the problem, consider the following silly class declarationp  precodeclass testClass     int data public     testClass         data  new int         data  5          testClass         delete data       codepre  pSo far so good. Now suppose that I create one of these objects in mainp  precodeint main     testClass myObject     return 0  codepre  pStill no issues of course. However, suppose that I now write a function that takes a testClass object as an input and call this from main.p  precodevoid doNotingtestClass copyOfMyObject     do nothing  int main     testClass myObject     doNothingmyObject     return 0  codepre  pThis time around, the function creates a local variable, copyOfMyObject, thats simply a copy of myObject. Then when the end of that function is reached, that local object automatically has its destructor called which deletes the memory pointed to by its data pointer. However, since this is the same memory pointed to by myObjects data pointer, myObject inadvertently has its memory deleted in the process. My question is what is a better way to design my classp

Negative 84518 pI have a card game where I need to display the value of the card after I shuffle I display the value of the card using values codex gtgt 1amp 0xfcode where x iterates through the list of 13 cards this is found as bit 14 is the value of the cardp  pthe above is card typep  pBut when I come across finding the highest pair in the card it only works when I use codevalues[afterfindingpairs[a]amp0xf0gtgt4]code.p  pThis is worked out as 04 bits are the no of pairs whereas the 47 bits are the values of the pair in the byte of pair type.p  pIt just displays the highest pair as Ace when I use p  pcodevalues[afterfindingpairs[a]amp0xfgtgt4]code.p  pIm confused wouldnt the hexadecimal 0xf0 deal with 8 bits rather than the 4 bit between 47 of the pair type which would be found by codevalues[afterfindingpairs[a]amp0xfgtgt4]code which is incorrect.p  pExplanation as to why this happens  would be much appreciated.p
Negative 84518 pI working with linux, bash.p  pI have one directory with strong100strong folders in it, each one named different.p  pIn each of these 100 folders, there is a file called first.bars so I have 100 files named strongfirst.barsstrong. Although all named first.bars, the files are actually slightly different. p  pI want to get all these files moved to one new folder and renamenumber these files so that I know which file comes from which folder. So the first strongfirst.barsstrong file must be renamed to strong001.barsstrong, the second to strong002.barsstrong.. etc.p  pI have tried the followingp  precodels d  gtgt homedirectorywiththe100folderslist.txt cat list.txt  while read line do cd line mv first.bars homenewfolder codepre  pThis does not work because I cant have 100 files, named the same, in one folder. So I only need to know how to rename them. The renaming must be connected to the cat list.txt, because the first line is the folder containing the first file wich is moved and renamed. That file will be called 001.bars.p
Negative 84518 pIm trying to learn Objective C by trying to convert a program I use that I wrote in C.  The program works with large 2 plus dimensional arrays and does calculations on them so I need to be able to display 2D arrays in a table format on the UI.  The best way I can come up with to do that is to convert my Cstyle arrays row by row to NSMutableArrays and then store the row NSMutableArrays in another NSMutableArray as a stack of rows to pass to an NSTableView.  If theres a better way, please let me know.p  pThe problem Im having is that I cant seem to get them to store in the arrayOfArrays.  Its just null.

Negative 84518 pHi  I have a question that is pretty much the same as one posted towards the end of last year  trouble is, i need to ask more about the answers provided as I am looking for an even simpler answer. other similar queries are for other languages  i want to do everything in html, MySql and PHP If possiblep  pThe other persons Query was posted here  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13549461showingeachquizinquiryseparatelyanswertabactivetabtopShowing each quiz inquiry separatelyap  pThe chosen answer was to do with ditching the while loop and replacing with sessions, but i cant work out how the code knows to loop back to the beginning again if you ditch while. why do you have to ditch a perfectly useful looping tool  forgive me here  i am very new to PHP and webtype languages. im from COBOL and Informix stock A bit of VB6, NO .Net , but plenty DB experience.p  pOkay, so what i want to know is  I have the same idea as the query above ie looping through an array of questions and answers, but NOT showing the next question until the previous one is answered that is in fact optional AND a Next button is clicked not optional. I have all the QampA thing sorted  but it displays all Questions with their options one after another, not just the first one.p  pI understand the use of Sessions for storing the answers and thats fine, ill deal with that later. all i want to know now is how to halt the While Loop so only one question shows at a time  until prompted for the next one. Im happy for them all to appear one after another on the same page, but as i say  only when i tell them to p  pEasy Steps pleasep  pThanks guys.p

First it added backbone sources to appbuilt.js file and after placed next string p  precodedefinelibbackbone, function codepre  pSo as result i have Backbone variable in the window but in my modules i use it in require.js way  codedefinemodelstodo,[jquery,underscore,libbackbone],function , , Backbone codep  pNo as global and as result in my modules Backbone local variable is undefined. And the same problem with underscore.js. R.js imported it in the same way.p  pSo question. How to avoid this problem with othew libs in future or how to fix this now SOme technicsp

And from then on all fields are available.p  pemUpdate 2em just placed another editBox outerField inside the dialog but outside of the iFrame. Also I created a new very simple Xpage to be loaded into the iFrame. The new simple Xpage only contains a single editBox innerField, nothing else. Result is like that after loading the dialog the cursor automatically is put into the outerField. Clicking into innerField the cursor is sent immediately back to outerField...p  pemUpdate 3em tried a few things on top p  ul liGoogle Chrome behaves just like FFli licreated an Xpage holding the very same custom control that hosts the iframe etc. Result if I run the stuff in its own page everythings fine. So it must be the extlib dialog thats causing trouble hereli lifinally tried the sandbox attributes with the iframe tag, without any visible differenceli ul

Negative 84518 pIm trying to serialize a class with protobufnet which contains an immutable collection as a member.p  pThe collection type, codeImmutableListltTgtcode, implements codeICollectionltTgtcode but returns codetruecode for the codeIsReadOnlycode property.

Negative 84518 pHeres a question that my team and I have been scouring the internet for help for, with little success.  It sounds like in our minds a common situation and zeroing in on the best approach could be very useful for many. p  pWe have an ASP.NET application that uses .NET code to control data access at a fairly granular level.  That is, we have a user table, a role table, security tables, workflow tables, then lots of business data tables.  Access to business data is highlyconfigurable by the end user, as they can selfadminister user accounts and security directly in the application.  Our .NET C code determines what data a particular request is entitled to based on Windows login, and serves it.  There is no relevant business security using SQL Server loginsroles.  p  pSo, bhow does one implement SSRS into a system that uses .NET code to programmatically enforce data access as defined in relational databp  pWe think our solution would look like one of the following p  p[SSRS Report]  [Datasource]  our .NET code that controls data access  [SQL Server] br  ...or... br  [SSRS Report]  our .NET code that controls data access  [Datasource]  [SQL Server]p  pIf this is correct, then what technology or concept are we missing to make this possible    p  pAny solution should meet these key requirementsp  ol liBusiness power users report creators should be able to create SSRS reports using Report Builder 3.0.  They should still be able to work with business data and relationships using Dataset Design View and Query Designer.li liBusiness power users report creators should not have to implement data access into their reports or data queries.  They should only have to worry about report design.li liEnd users report consumers accessing the report, will get filtered data done by .NET code in their report based on their specific level of access.li ol  pSurely someone else out there is using .NET code to manage data accessis SSRS not an option in this scenariop  pThanksp

Negative 84518 pIs it really not possible to use history.pushState over subdomains, even if using CORS I tried to configure NGINX to act that way, didnt seem to work.

Negative 84518 pI have to do a codeListViewcode that contains on each item an codeEditTextcode.

Negative 84518 pI have a Qt 4.8 app with its front end UI all done via QML in a QDeclarativeView.p  pOn the original Linux version of the app, there are a couple of fonts it uses in QML in Text items via specifyingp  precodefont.family ReykjavikOne OT AGauge codepre  porp  precodefont.family ReykjavikOne OT CGauge codepre  pand these work as expected the CGauge one is a sort of fat, bold version.p  pHowever, on the Mac port, both these seem to fall back to some ugly default fallback sans font.

The CGauge font seems to be perfectly usable in other apps on the Mac, so Im assuming this is an issue peculiar to QtQML.p  pThere just doesnt seem to be any QML Textfont mechanism at least, not one I can discover by which I can select a font style with style name CGauge.  Messing around with boldfontweight just seems to get me a bolder AGauge, or the default font.p  pMuch the same applies to QML RichText content too.  Text with codeltstylegtltstylegtcode elements containing codefontfamily ReykjavikOne OT CGaugecode work fine on Linux, but on Mac it reverts to the fallback font and codeReykjavikOne OTcode is the best can be done, obtaining the AGauge.  Adding a codefontweight boldcode does get a bold AGauge, but CGauge is noticeably fatter.p  pBoth Mac and Linux DebianWheezy systems have the fonts installed from the same .otf files.p  pWhats my best hope to work round this issue and get the CGauge style of the font to display on the Mac as intended  NB Im a novice when it comes to fonts, and Macs.p

Server read that request then writes a response that the client will read.p  pThe problem with this code is the codeOutputStream.closecode in the client and codeInputStream.closecode in the server. As stated in the Javadocs, closing the stream will close the codeSocketcode. The result is that when the client tries to read the server response, the codeSocketcode is already closed.p  pIve managed to overcome this by calling codeSocket.shutdownInputcode and codeSocket.shutdownOutputcode instead. However I am still thinking whether this is the proper way of doing itp  pAs a note, closing the streams with codeclosecode when server writes the response or when the client reads it doesnt create problems I would guess the closing is synchronized between client and server.p  pSo my questions arep  ol liIs using the Socket shutdown methods a proper way li liCan I keep closing the last streams with codeclosecode when sending and reading response from server li liCould it happen that closing with shutdown would keep some data in the buffer and wouldnt be sentli ol

The CSS for the basic layout looks like follows. First, by wrapping all other content with the wrapper div we restrict the overall page width to 90 of the browser and leave a little bit of extra margin to the topborder. In addition, the marginleft  marginright is set to auto meaning our content will always be centered inside the browser.  Open the code in a new window and resize it to see how the width adapts First, in our CSS section we introduce a little bit of padding between the browser window and the content. Then, we add some color to the header and footer to actually see them.   The wrapper centers the rest of the content  divwrapper width90 margin 10px auto   add some color to distinguish the three sections of the document header, the main section and the footer.   Next, we set explicitly the height of the header to 80 pixels, add some background color and padding. The margin values introduce top and bottom spacing of 10px. In addition all content will be centered with textaligncenter.  headersite      height80px     padding10px     backgroundcolor0033FF     margin10px 0px     textaligncenter  Finally, the  footer. Usually has a small fontsize which is set in our example to 0.8 units of the standard size. Again, some background color. The clearboth make sure that the footer actually is displayed below the main article it explictly tells the browser that no floating elements are allowed on both sides of the footer. footer      fontsize0.8em     clearboth  footer .col      width30     margin1 1.1     padding2px     height100px     backgroundcolorF63     floatleft    nav      backgroundcolor0033FF     floatleft     width30     height100   nav ul      liststylenone  nav ul li      floatleft  nav ul li a        display block       backgroundcolorCCC     marginright 20px       width 110px       lineheight1.5em       textalign center       textdecoration none       color 000       nav ul li ahover            color fff           backgroundcolor39C     The actual trick of aligning both the main article and the navigation horizontally on the same line is done with floatleft while making sure that both fill the full available width. Note that although the sum of the article  nav layer adds up to 100, the padding introduced for the body actually reduces the overall width to 90 of the browser window.  The CSS for the article tag. Here we have to make sure that we leave some space for the advertising, so we set its width to 80. In addition, in order to prevent that the ads are being pushed below the main article, we set  floatleft.  article      backgroundcolor0066FF     floatleft     width69     marginright10px   marginleft31   article header      backgroundcolorF90     padding15px   sectionabstract      fontsize1.09em     fontstyleitalic     margin10px 0px     textalignjustify     padding5px 80px   sectionmain      fontsize1em     padding20px     textalignjustify   sectionmain   float left   margin 0   padding 0   display inline         On the right border we place the ads. This is done with the aside tag indicating only remotely related content to the actual article. Each ad has a specific height and width. The overall width together with the main article adds up to 98 80  18. This is necessary because we have to take into account the 10px marginright of the article. floatleft makes sure the ads are really on the same height as the main article not below.  .ads      height100     width30     backgroundcolor0033FF     marginbottom0px     floatleft        .ads pfirstchild      padding15px      fontsize2em  .ads plastchild      paddingleft15px      fontsize1emcolorCCC codepre  pI would like this to look like my current web sitep  pa hrefhttpmultiskillz.tekcities.com relnofollowhttpmultiskillz.tekcities.comap

Negative 84518 pIm digging into customizing controls via CSS and I got pretty far. So Im able to fully customize my scrollbar by e.g. setting tracks background to transparent and so on. But Im stuck with the ScrollBarSkin investigated via ScenicViewer. It seems that this skin has a default background color gradient and a border, which Im not able to modify. So my question is, how can i access the e.g. TableCellSkin or ScrollBarSkin, to modify background color and insets via CSSp  pedit Im using jdk7p  pedit2 i found some syntax in the caspian.css for the ScrollPaneSkin.

Negative 84518 pI am running an optimization algorithm in MATLAB and I am calling a Batch file which calls an EXE file to do a task for each iteration in MATLAB. I want this EXE to run and close before the code in MATLAB continues to the next iteration. So far I have made use of the START WAIT commands in the Batch file and they work. Here is my example p  precodeecho off TITLE Ostrich  Optimizaton Software Toolkit  REM Launch Ostrich,wait until it completes START WAIT OSTRICH MIN Ostrich.exe  echo Done gt OstDone.txt codepre  pNow here is my problem. If Ostrich.exe crashes, I get a prompt asking me to debug or close the program. This means I have to be present and watching the screen when I am running this algorithm not convenient, I am running over 1000 iterations on a sometimes slow EXE. I have to close the program before the MATLAB code can continue.p  pNow, if I get rid of the WAIT part, add a timer and do thisp  precodeecho off TITLE Ostrich  Optimizaton Software Toolkit  REM Launch Ostrich START OSTRICH MIN Ostrich.exe  REM Wait 2 seconds ping localhost n 2 w 2500 gt nul  REM If it takes more than 2 seconds it has probably crashed. Exit if errorlevel neq 0 exit b errorlevel codepre  pThe code above introduces new problems. First, I have to estimate the time it takes for the EXE to run each time it is not a constant amount of time, so I have to set an upper bound and the error checking line just doesnt work to close the EXE probably just closes the batch file which is not ideal.p  pUnder the second code, if the EXE crashes then a prompt comes up. However, the MATLAB loop continues and a new instance of the EXE is run in a new window. If I get enough crashes, I end up with several prompts open at the end of the MATLAB loop. In the context of the overall algorithm, it is not a big deal but it is also not ideal.p  pBasically, I want to code something that closes and reruns the EXE file if it crashes, or just closes it with no debug or close prompt while still making use of the WAIT command as it allows me to take advantage of some fast EXE runs speed of EXE depends on many factors that I may tinker with in its input files.p  pI am new to using Batch files and any help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 84518 pI am working on a system where users are able to submit HTML to the system, and then preview the resulting page. The HTML submitted by the user is given to the page via a call to HTML.Raw in the view, where it is displayed as part of a table with other data. In a naive implementation, it is being displayed like sop  precode...     lttdgt         ltdivgtHtml.RawUserEnteredHTMLIsFetchedHereltdivgt     lttdgt ... codepre  pThe problem I am having is that the userentered HTML is not guaranteed to be errorfree far from it, in fact. If a user enters an unclosed div tag in the HTML and then goes to preview it, that unclosed tag returned by Html.Raw will close on the div emoutsideem of the Html.Raw call and create improper nesting on the entire page.p  pI am looking for a way to sequester the output of Html.Raw so that unclosed tags will not interfere with the rest of the page.p  pI have attempted to use iframe tags to accomplish this setting the src to the encoded HTML, but it did not play nice with CSS. I would like the existing CSS of the page to be preserved within the sequestered HTML if at all possible.p  pIm not sure if this is a way that Html.Raw is even supposed to be used, but this is an implementation that I am modifying, not creating, and I would like to preserve as much of the original implementation as possible.p

Negative 84518 pI am trying to create a basic map editor for fun which consists of a scrollbox and paintbox to draw the grid.p  pIn the OnMouseDown event for the paintbox I create images at runtime and add them inside the scrollbox, the grid paintbox is painted above the images  because if the grid was at the back it just would not look good .p  pHere is a sample screenp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMeiro.jpg altenter image description herep  pMy question would solve two of my problems in one.p  ul liI need to be able to drag and drop to move the images around at runtime.li liI also need to be able to get the X and Y position of the image to display as information.li ul  pHere is where my problem lies, to solve the problems above I first need to get the Image under the mouse cursor. But because I paint my grid paintbox above the images, the cursor will only ever see the paintbox grid, and not the underlying images.p  pI did experiment with copying the paintbox grid to a TImage but it came out all wrong and I was getting out of memory errors. The size of the maps could be quite large and so putting the grid onto a bitmap is not ideal due the memory and limitations etc.p  pThe grid must go on the top, otherwise it would look something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUB2ba.jpg altenter image description herep  pWhich hides the grid, and I dont want that to happen.p  pSo, how can I see past the paintbox and get to the images underneath, using FindVCLWindow or something similarp

Negative 84518 pSo Im back and Ive got another issue concerning graphics.p  pI searched Google and also searched stackoverflow. I might not have been thorough enough, but I figured half an hour of no results means its time to ask another question.p  pAfter getting past my graphical issue with DrawImage, now Im having another issue linked to the same method call.p  pI have my form load code herep  precodeprivate void frmMapEditorLoadobject sender, EventArgs e                      loadComponents             Program.debug.printLoad complete.          codepre  pAnd I have this code in loadComponentsp  precodeprivate void loadComponents              Rectangle srcRectTiles  new Rectangle0, 0, 16  16, 20  16         GraphicsUnit units  GraphicsUnit.Pixel          screenTiles.DrawImagegfxTiles, 0, 0, srcRectTiles, units      codepre  pNow, Ive made sure the graphics work by calling Load in a Click event, and the code runs just fine. Its just when I run the game and expect to see something on load, nothing happens. The debug code you see there displays the output Load complete. after Load is ran to make sure it is indeed being called, but it doesnt seem to be running the actual code inside loadComponents. Ive even added debug code to that method, and they print their outputs in the console accordingly...p  pAny insight would be wonderful I can offer more code if necessary. Maybe theres a way of debugging this Im not quite catching onto.p
Negative 84518 pI am wondering if it is possible to fall victim to issues around the management of managed threads in the native world when you marshal a callback delegate to a DLL through PInvoke in my particular case below see example code.p  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary74169f59.aspx relnofollowThis MSDN article on Managed and Unmanaged Threading in Windowsa statesp  pemAn operatingsystem ThreadId has no fixed relationship to a managed thread, because an unmanaged host can control the relationship between managed and unmanaged threads. Specifically, a sophisticated host can use the Fiber API to schedule many managed threads against the same operating system thread, or to move a managed thread among different operating system threads.emp  pFirst of all, who or what is the emunmanaged hostem this article describes If you use marshaling like in the example code I give below, then who or what is the unmanaged host therep  pAlso, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5624128howdoigettherealthreadidinaclrfriendlywaythis StackOverflow questionas accepted answer statesp  pemIts perfectly legal from a CLR perspective for a single managed thread to be backed by several different native threads during its lifetime. This means the result of GetCurrentThreadId can and will change throughout the course of a threads lifetime.emp  pSo, does this mean my APC will be queued in a native thread, or delegated directly to my managed thread because of the marshaling layerp  pstrongHere is the examplestrong.

Negative 84518 pI want to use a codeDivModcode function that operates exclusively on 32 bit operands. The a hrefhttpdocwiki.embarcadero.comLibrariesenSystem.Math.DivModimplementation in the RTLa returns values in 16 bit variables. Its declaration isp  precodeprocedure DivModDividend Cardinal Divisor Word var Result, Remainder Word codepre  pSo, I cannot use that since my inputs may overflow the return values.p  pThe naive Pascal implementation looks like thisp  precodeprocedure DivModDividend, Divisor Cardinal out Quotient, Remainder Cardinal begin   Quotient  Dividend div Divisor   Remainder  Dividend mod Divisor end codepre  pThis works splendidly but performs the division twice. Since the function is called by part of my code that is in a performance bottleneck, I would like to perform the division once only. To that end I am using Sergs 32 bit DivMod from this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2397656isthereadivmodthatisnotlimitedtowords65535Is there a DivMod that is not Limited to Words lt65535ap  precodeprocedure DivModDividend, Divisor Cardinal out Quotient, Remainder Cardinal asm         PUSH EBX         MOV  EBX,EDX         XOR  EDX,EDX         DIV  EBX         MOV  [ECX],EAX         MOV  EBX,Remainder         MOV  [EBX],EDX         POP  EBX end codepre  pThis works perfectly.p  pBut now I would like a version of the function for 64 bit code. Note that I still want to operate on 32 bit operands, and return 32 bit values. p  pShould I rewrite the function using 64 bit assembler, or is it sufficient to use the codeDivModcode overload from the RTL that operates on, and returns, 64 bit values p  pSpecifically I would like to know if there is a performance benefit in writing 64 bit code that does 32 bit operations. Is that even possible Or would I simply end up reimplementing the codeDivModcode overload with codeUInt64code parameters If it is worth implementing a bespoke 64 bit asm version, how would I go about doing it, noting that the operands and operations are 32 bit.p  pI think that it would look like this, but I am no expert and likely have got something wrongp  precodeprocedure DivModDividend, Divisor Cardinal out Quotient, Remainder Cardinal asm         MOV   EAX,ECX    move Dividend to EAX         MOV   ECX,EDX    move Divisor to ECX         XOR   EDX,EDX    zeroise EDX         DIV   ECX        divide EDXEAX by ECX         MOV   [R8],EAX   save quotient         MOV   [R9],EDX   save remainder end codepre

Upon   receipt of the query string parameters, your system must also create a   sha1, or a hash of the values passed, and your Secret Key.p      pThe validity of the data received is evaluated by using the cverify   parameter we send and the value produced in your system.

Negative 84518 pI have a large file with every line in the same format it is a emspreadsheetlikeem strongfixedlengthstrong plaintext data file. Im using emUnixem tools like codegrepcode, codetailcode, strongetcstrong.p  pI want to find lines which contain the strongleast number of spacesstrong. I take it as a crude criteria to find the most interesting lines in the file, since having less spaces means more data to check.p  pI imagine I could sort the lines by the number of spacesnonspace characters and get the head or tail of the output. Something like empseudocodeemp  precodesort by num of spaces asc OR num of nonspaces desc bigfile.txt      head 100 gt interesting.txt codepre  pstrongConversely,strong I could use the same method to find lines with the strongmost number of spacesstrong as well, again to crudely check that all mandatory data is available in each line.p  pstrongNotestrong Loading the whole file into memory is out of the question.

Negative 84518 pQuite often, I swap an atom value using an anonymous function that uses one or more external values in calculating the new value.  There are two ways to do this, one with what I understand is a closure and one not, and my question is which is the better  more efficient way to do itp  pHeres a simple madeup example  adding a variable numeric value to an atom  showing both approachesp  precodedef myatom atom 0  defn addvalwithclosure [n]   swap myatom           fn [currval]              we pull n from outside the scope of the function             asking the compiler to do some magic to make this work             currval n   defn addvalnoclosure [n]   swap myatom           fn [currval valtoadd]              we bring n into the scope of the function as the second function parameter             so no closure is needed             currval valtoadd          n codepre  pThis is a madeup example, and of course, you wouldnt actually write this code to solve this specific problem, becausep  precodeswap myatom  n codepre  pdoes the same thing without any need for an additional function.p  pBut in more complicated cases you do need a function, and then the question arises.  For me, the two ways of solving the problem are of about equal complexity from a coding perspective.  If thats the case, which should I prefer  My working assumption is that the nonclosure method is the better one because its simpler for the compiler to implement.p  pTheres a third way to solve the problem, which is not to use an anonymous function.  If you use a separate named function, then you cant use a closure and the question doesnt arise.  But inlining an anonymous function often makes for more readable code, and Id like to leave that pattern in my toolkit.p  pThanksp  pstrongedit in response to A. Webbs answer belowstrong this was too long to put into a commentp  pMy use of the word efficiency in the question was misleading.  Better words might have been elegance or simplicity.  p  pOne of the things that I like about Clojure is that while you can write code to execute any particular algorithm faster in other languages, if you write idiomatic Clojure code its going to be decently fast, and its going to be simple, elegant, and maintainable.  As the problems youre trying to solve get more complex, the simplicity, elegance and maintainability get more and more important.  IMO, Clojure is the most efficient tool in this sense for solving a whole range of complex problems.  p  pMy question was really  given that there are two ways that I can solve this problem, whats the more idiomatic and Clojureesque way of doing it  For me when I ask that question, how fast the two approaches are is one consideration.  Its not the most important one, but I still think its a legitimate consideration if this is a common pattern and the different approaches are a wash from other perspectives.  I take A. Webbs answer below to be, Whoa  Pull back from the weeds  The compiler will handle either approach just fine, and the relative efficiency of each approach is anyway unknowable without getting deeper into the weeds of target platforms and the like. So take your hint from the name of the language and when it makes sense to do so, use closures.p  pstrongclosing edit on April 10, 2014strongp  pIm going to mark A. Webbs answer as accepted, although Im really accepting A. Webbs answer and omiels answer  unfortunately I cant accept them both, and adding my own answer that rolls them up seems just a bit gratuitous.p  pOne of the many things that I love about Clojure is the community of people who work together on it.  Learning a computer language doesnt just mean learning code syntax  more fundamentally it means learning patterns of thinking about and understanding problems. Clojure, and Lisp behind it, has an incredibly powerful set of such patterns.  For example, homoiconicity code as data means that you can dynamically generate code at compile time using macros, or destructuring allows you to concisely and readably unpack complex data structures.  None of the patterns are unique to Clojure, but Clojure brings them all together in ways that make solving problems a joy.  And the only way to learn those patterns is from people who know and use them already.  When I first picked Clojure more than a year ago, one of the reasons that I picked it over Scala and other contenders was the reputation of the Clojure community for being helpful and constructive. And I havent been disappointed  this exchange around my question, like so many others on StackOverflow and elsewhere, shows how willing the community is to help a newcomer like me  thank youp

Negative 84518 pI am getting some weird issue in my Project.p  pI am creating a project which contains some checklist table items.p  pFor this I had a IPadRootViewController class which is parent class of my project, Now i am adding a child viewcontroller Dashboarrootviewcontroller which is having Navigation bar and two view containers which are linked to dashboardviewcontroller and webviewcontroller.p  pThe webViewController is a Hybrid Page which is designed by html and angular JS. For first time app laoded then i am showing webview controllerwith full page frame adding as a child viewcontroller of iPadrootviewcontroller. after this page i am loading dashboardrootviewcontroller which is having dashboardview at left container and webviewcontroller same instance at right container. Here right side webviewcontroller contains the detail of an item in dashboardviewcontrollers table.p  pIn dashboardviewcontroller i am having a tableview and 3 buttons which is used to sort, filter, group for the tableview items.p  pFirstly i am sending a request to fetch the data from server. After getting response i am parsing and storing it. and then i am loading the table which is a component having a tableview.p  pI am reloading the dashboardRootview if i am coming back from Full Page WebViewControllerp  pI am posting a request to fetch data manually when i am loading dashboardRootviewcontroller.p  pthis time the dashboardviewcontroller is not responding and dashboard table is empty even though all the datasource methods table is printing correct values in console NSLog. p  pAt same time the background sync from server also starts whenever server database has changes. At this time  i am sending a notification to refetch data from server. This time the dashboardviewcontroller is responding and table is also loading.p  pMy dashboardviewcontroller is not responding to any method in simulator not in debugging that will change the UI from Xib, if i send a request other than the way of through notification.p  pI had noticed that if I press the buttons FilterBy, SortBy, GroupBy and select any option then the table is reloading fine. p  pI am sorry to say that I am unable to show my code.p  pOne more thing i have noticed in debug, whenever i am posting notification to reload the data which i am making request to fetch data from local server and then after getting response i am reloading table.p  pIn both scenarioswith issue and without issue i am using same order of methods in order to get data from server and then reload table.p

Negative 84518 pI have one more question, then Ill be done for a while I hope.p  pMy app is 100 complete, except for one problem. The app I use generally has people swapping screens very frequently, and every time they return to a specific screen the information is reset, just as if youre entering it for the first time.p  pIm aware of Shared Objects, but dont have a clue on getting it to work properly. When I think I have it right, Ill go into the app, swap screens and everything will appear as if it was entered for the first time without any value changes, despite no compiler errors when I go to test it.p  pWhat Im aiming to do is this  the moment you change the value of a string, it saves itself to the app as soon as its changed. At the beginning of each screen it would call up the data that was saved to it. There are reset buttons that change it to how it was if someone wanted to reset. p  pCan anyone help with this I really appreciate itp

Negative 84518 pim currently having problems with a php website that im buidling. p  pMy site uses dropdown menus to select product categories and list them to an html table on the same page. What I would then like to be able to do, would be to give the user the option to change the order of the table results according to the column of their choice. p  pI have tried creating multiple SQL query scenarios for each permutation, but however I try to complete this, it refuses to work. p  pOne of the things im struggling with is the php url, when I select a random product category the url is displayed as main.phpchild60010 e.g.. What I think needs to happen is when a sort order is selected, the url adds the order type into the url like this main.phpchild60010sortpreis1desc but I cant seem to be able to get my head around itp

Negative 84518 pOkay So Im trying to create an interactive pause menu that has access to Input.GetAxis using Unity 4.6s new UI. p  pAs long as the Navigation relationships are set up for the selectable elements In my case a series of buttons and codeInteractablecode is set to true then the UI works just fine but, when I set the codeTime.timeScale  0.0fcode then keyboard input navigation no longer works. However the mouse input clicks and animation still work as intended.p  pIve tried several different ways to get around the time scale problem and the best Ive got so far is checking the value returned from codeInput.GetAxiscode while in the body of the codeUpdatecode message of the codeMonoBehavorcode base object. This somewhat works but my results are either the very top or very bottom of the Button selected collection. Im thinking this is because update gets called a great deal more than codeFixedUpdatecode and would make sense if my console printed out more call to the method that moves up and down the selection. So with that Im thinking its one of those office space type errors, off by 1 decimal place or something silly but I just cant seem to see it. Otherwise I think my solution would be a fairly viable work around.  p  pThe following is an image of my Unity Setup with mentioned game objects in Unity 4.6 followed by my code. p  pa hrefhttpimgur.comROnRzt1 relnofollowimg srchttpi.imgur.comROnRzt1.jpg titleHosted by imgur.com ap  precodepublic class PlayerInGameMenu  MonoBehaviour    public EventSystem eventSystem    Selectable SelectedButton   public Selectable Status   public Selectable Settings   public Selectable Save   public Selectable Quit    public bool Paused    ListltSelectablegt buttons   int selecteButtonIndex  0    public Canvas Menu    void Start        Menu.enabled  false     buttons  new ListltSelectablegt     buttons.AddStatus     buttons.AddSettings     buttons.AddSave     buttons.AddQuit     SelectedButton  buttons[0]        void Update         CheckInput      if Paused  Menu.enabled            ShowMenu          else if Paused  Menu.enabled            HideMenu            void ShowMenu        Paused  true     Menu.enabled  true     Time.timeScale  0.0f       void HideMenu        if Menu.enabled            Paused  false       Menu.enabled  false       Time.timeScale  1.0f            void CheckInput        if cInput.GetKeyDownPause            Paused  Paused       SelectedButton  buttons[selecteButtonIndex]       eventSystem.SetSelectedGameObjectSelectedButton.gameObject, new BaseEventDataeventSystem           if Paused            float v  cInput.GetAxisVertical        to attempt to cut down on the input sensitity I am checking 0.5 instead of just 0.0       if v gt 0.5                  GoDown              else if v lt 0.5                  GoUp                   void GoDown        go to the last button available if we go past the index     if selecteButtonIndex gt buttons.Count  1            selecteButtonIndex  buttons.Count  1          else            selecteButtonIndex  selecteButtonIndex  1            go to the first button available if we go past the index   void GoUp        if selecteButtonIndex lt 0            selecteButtonIndex  0          else            selecteButtonIndex  selecteButtonIndex  1         codepre  p I know its in beta but Im wondering if you are going to implement navigation why would you design it in such a way that codeTime.timeScale0.0fcode the easy way to pause a game does not work with the UI button navigation naturally. Problems for minds greater than I maybe  Or there is a simple way to do it and I just do not know what bit I need to flip. p  p Ive also considered just freezing rigid bodies on pause but that seems like will require a huge time investment in my existing code base and will not be a universal solution across all game objects particularly colliders that do not rely on Rigid bodies and particle systems. Im pretty open minded about solutions but it seems like there should be a really easy way to do this.  p

Negative 84518 pIve developed several Direct3D applications using Visual C Express 2008 MDX.  They all run without a problem on my computer but when I try to run them on other peoples computers, they crash.  I tried using Clickonce to install them but they still crash.  Im developing them on Windows 7, and they crash on most Win Vista, 7, and 8 PCs, but never on XP which is weird.p  pMost of my apps keep a log file for diagnostics and the first thing they are programmed to do is write a Startup line to the log file, but they never even get that far.  I dont get the normal .NET unhandled exception error it crashes before the runtime even starts.p  pIt has to have something to do with the DirectX libraries none of my other apps ever crash, but I know all the computers have DirectX and .NET installed, so Im quite baffled by this.  If Im linking to nonstandard libraries then I would assume ClickOnce would package them with my app when I publish it.p  pI know most of you would say to use SlimDx, and I do want to do that but before I port all my apps over I would like to be able to distribute them as they are.p  pSince my app cant even start up, Im unable to track down the cause.  Has anyone else experienced thisp
Negative 84518 pI want the client program TCP to be ready to connect to the server program whenever the server starts to accept incoming connections the client program should always stay running, and the server program can start or end whenever it wants.

Negative 84518 pThis question is for standards gurus.p  pWhat does a typical C compiler do that Java doesnt or viceversa when interpreting floating point values.p  pNow I know the basics of how floating point numbers are stored. I know that the computer cannot exactly represent those numbers that are not a power of 2. p  pHowever, it occurred to me that C somehow manages to correct for that.For example the expression 0.15  0.15 yields 0.3 when compiled in C gcc as opposed to 0.30000000000000004 in Java So my question is twofoldp  ol lipIf the number is actually represented internally as 0.30000000000000004, what does a C compiler do to correct for it Does it simply reduce the precision Does the correction happen only when the number is evaluated Is there an overhead Or is it actually stored as 0.3 somehowpli lipWhat was the rationale behind the design decision that makes Java not correct for it. This makes using floating point primitives a real pain in Java Yes I am aware of BigDecimal etc. Is it faster this way Is it more correctpli ol  pIf there is a benefit behind the Javaway of doing things I would be glad to hear it.p  pI really would like to hear both sides in this. This is for programming language design research.p

So I tried using a hrefhttpscode.google.compmoq relnofollowMoqa, but that of course requires that the mock target is an interface so that it can provide a stub implementation.

Negative 84518 pMy goal is to parse a large XML file 20 GB with Swift. There are some performance issues with NSXMLParser and bridging to Swift objects, so Im looking at multithreading. Specifically the following divisionp  ol liMain thread  parses datali liWorker thread  casts ObjC types into Swift types and sends to 1. The casting of ObjC NSDictionary to [String String] is the largest bottleneck. This is also the main reason for separating onto multiple threads.li liWorker thread  parses XML into ObjC types  and sends to 2. NSXMLParser is a pushparser, once it starts parsing, you cannot pause it.li ol  pThe data should be parsed sequentially, so the input ordering should be maintained. My idea is to run an NSRunLoop on both 1 and 2, allowing parallel processing without blocking. According to Apples documentation, communication between the threads can be achieved by calling a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualMultithreadingRunLoopManagementRunLoopManagement.htmlapplerefdocuid10000057iCH16SW1 relnofollowcodeperformSelectoronThreadwithObjectwaitUntilDonecodea.

Negative 84518 pReading a hrefhttpssoftware.intel.comsitesdefaultfilesma1edsohowto.pdf relnofollowUlrich Dreppers Shared Lib Howtoa I came across the strange for my understanding fact that applications which use shared libraries are loaded in two steps. First the Kernel loads the applications image, then it adds the dynamic linkerloader binary into the address space and passes control to it. The dynamic linkerloader runs in user space, supposedly within the time slice of the application and pulls in the rest of the code or links the references to already loaded shared objects. Was this the idea i.e. to restrict runtime consumption why such a complicated scheme was chosen p

Negative 84518 pSorry for yet another question about Angular and CORS but I just cant pin down where the issue lies. My basic setup is a pure angular standalone website, so no Express or any serverside component, that talks to a Java based API on another server. The API is built using JAXRS and lives in a JBoss 7.1.3 application server. I have access to the code for both the angular and the java. p  pOn the API side, CORS is enabled using the popular thetransactioncompany CORS filter shown below.p  precodeltfiltergt     ltfilternamegtCORSltfilternamegt     ltfilterclassgtcom.thetransactioncompany.cors.CORSFilterltfilterclassgt     ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegtcors.supportedMethodsltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegtGET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONSltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt     ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegtcors.supportedHeadersltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegtOrigin, Accept, ContentType, XRequestedWith, Cookie,contenttypeltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt ltfiltergt ltfiltermappinggt     ltfilternamegtCORSltfilternamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt ltfiltermappinggt codepre  pThe way the API works is by providing a username and password to an endpoint that returns a token, this token is then included in the Authorization header in every subsequent request. The first part of the process works fine, I can provide valid credentials and receive a token, but then any subsequent request never works. So in my Angular service I have the following login method that fetches me a token then attempts to get the current logged in user.p  precodelogin functionusername, password          var deferred  q.defer          http             method POST,             url httplocalhost8080websiteapirestaccounttoken,             headers ContentType applicationxwwwformurlencoded, Accept applicationjson,             transformRequest functionobj                  var str  []                 forvar p in obj                     str.pushencodeURIComponentp    encodeURIComponentobj[p]                                   return str.joinamp             ,             data username username, password password                   .successfunctiontoken               log.infotoken.jwt              var requestConfig                   headers                      Authorization token.jwt,                     Accept applicationjson,                     XTesting Testing                                            http.gethttplocalhost8080websiteapirestuserscurrent, requestConfig                 .successfunctionuser                       log.infoRetrieved User                     user.sessionToken  token.jwt                     deferred.resolveuser                                   .errorfunctiondata, status, headers, config                       log.infodata                     log.infostatus                     log.infoheaders                     log.infoconfig                                    .errorfunctiondata, status, headers, config               log.infodata             log.infostatus             log.infoheaders             log.infoconfig                   return deferred.promise      codepre  pThe first request works perfectly, the second fails with the errorp  precodeXMLHttpRequest cannot load httplocalhost8080websiteapirestuserscurrent. No AccessControlAllowOrigin header is present on the requested resource. Origin httplocalhost9000 is therefore not allowed access. codepre  pI cant figure out if the setup of the CORS filter on the API is the cause of my issue or theres something Im not doing correctly when sending the request from Angular. I suspect it is Angular because I can use the third party services Postman and Hurl.it to test my API endpoints and they return the user object as intended.p  pAny help will be much appreciated p

If I hardcode a solution into the PHP file for a certain HTML file, then the PHP file would not be useful anymore for the others. I could then simply use the PHP file inside the folder of each HTML file but then I would have theh same file repeated many times, which is very bad for maintenance purposes.p  pEDIT 2 I may have found a way to solve the problem.

Even though it would hazve succeeded, and my breakpoint inside of getCurrentUser never seems to be hit. Its almost as if its a foregone conclusion, since it was null the last time , even though it would have resolved this time.p  pIm kind of baffled as to why codegetCurrentUsercode is never called on the request for codeISecurityServicecode. I even tried explicitly sticking a code.LifecycleIsltUniquePerRequestLifecyclegtcode on my hookup for handling codeICurrentUsercode with no effect.sp  pUPDATE  Ok so just a heads up, Ive started using the method accepted below, and while it has worked great so far, it didnt resolve my core problem. Turns out the new codeStructureMap.MVC5code, based on codeStructureMap3code, uses NestedContainers. Which scope their requests to the lifetime of the NestedContainer, regardless of the default being Transient. So when I requested codeHttpContextBasecode for the first time, it will then return that same instance for the rest of the request even though later on in the request lifespan, the context has changed. You need to either not use NestedContainer which, as I understand it will complicate things ASP.NET vNext, or you explicitly set the lifecycle of the codeForltgt.Useltgtcode mapping to give you a new instance per request. Note that this scoping per NestedContainer causes problems with Controllers as well in MVC. While the codeStructureMap.MVC5code package handles this with a codeControllerConventioncode, it does not handle Views, and recursive views or views used multiple times will likely cause you problems as well. Im still looking for a permanent fix for the Views problem, for the moment Ive reverted to the codeDefaultContainercode.p

Negative 84518 pI have an app consisting of an activity with two fragment areas  on the top a toolbar fragment, and below that a content fragment area that contains whatever fragment I want to load. As the user progresses through the app the content area is populated by different single fragments to reflect this only one fragment at a time, taking up the whole area that isnt taken up by the toolbar fragment, but the toolbar fragment stays the same. So far so good.. but when the user is on the first screen, before he has navigated to a different fragment, the navigation icon top left on the toolbar shows the 3line icon indicating the user is on the top level of the app. When the user changes to a different content fragment this navigation icon turns into an arrow pointing back, and clicking on it performs onbackpressed on the content fragment going one backwards in the backstack embutem the navigation icon stays as a back arrow  it doesnt turn back to the 3line icon.

We hope this helps make your experience more professionally rewarding for you. codepre  pOne major question I have is with regards to the print statements I have commented out above. The last print is a confirmation to me that I successfully reached the end of the script. However, if any of those commented out print statements are included the script stops right there and nothing further is printed out.p  pAs I mentioned, I am not that experienced with PHP so one problem is I dont know what the problem is with those particular print statements. No error message is displayed I suspect the default setup suppresses error messages so they arent displayed to users. So one thing I would like to know, especially when testing, is what errors are encountered.p  pWhy would those particular profile fields codepositions, languages, skills and educationscode cause a problem Since the profile field names are plurals, one guess is that maybe what is returned is not a simple string which can be shown with codeprintcode and they are maybe arrays or something else which requires a different way to display them. I didnt see more definitions about the values of those particular fields in the docs, so if somebody could help me with information about them I would be grateful.p  pSome plural sounding fields just returned blanks codespecialties, certifications, publicationscode so Im guessing those had null values rather than some specially formatted list of values to be shown in a special way.p  pOther print statements work, and show the actual profile content e.g. my codeindustrycode is printed as codeComputer Softwarecode obviously not PHP though, or in some cases a string with a minus in front of it. For example, codepublicprofileurl profileurlcode. p  pAs for the values with a minus in front of it, what does that mean Why is my codepublicprofileurlcode returned as codeprofileurlcode Does it mean a hidden field I dont see where I can even hide that. p  pI would be grateful for any information people can provide.p

I run Proguard on release build and it works fine. I do not want to run proguard on debug build as it makes debugging hard.

So i need to check the condition for whether the ip address is added in applicationhost.config file, and if the ip exists then that user is allowed the access to web page directlywithout adding its IP to IIS and if ip doesnot exits, then new ip added into IIS and then the user is allowed the access to web page.I have worked with above code to check the condition but it is not working. Where am I wrong How can i check this condition in above code Please Help.  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 84518 pRecently I was reading the famous Algorithm design book CLRSCormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stain, 3rd edition. And between the classical KMP and Rabin  Karp algorithm there is a part about string matching with finite automata. So the algorithm creates the automata according to the pattern and starts processing on the string. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgh4qE.png altenter image description herep  pSo here in this example, the algorithm searches the pattern ababaca in the input string. So everything seems logical to me, beside two things. p  pWhy there is no path to the previous states from state 4 when I get to b, because in that case I will have ababb, which already is a mismatch And what happen when I read b or c from the state 6 Is there something that I misunderstood Also there is no reading c case from the states 0 to 4 and so on..p

Negative 84518 pIm building a script to install everything needed for MediaWiki in one command on CentOS. Starting with a completely minimal install, this builds Apache, PHP, and Node.js from source plus sets up all the other necessary things to have a MediaWiki install with all the bells and whistles. This works great when invoked by root. When invoked by a nonroot sudoer it had some strange issues. All this code is available at the GitHub repo enterprisemediawikiMeza1 sorry, I dont have enough reputation on this site to post more than 2 linksp  pBasically the user calls one script, codeinstall.shcode. This script calls several other scripts, such as codeapache.shcode, codephp.shcode, and codeVE.shcode. codeVE.shcode installs Node.js and Parsoid part of MediaWikis Visual Editor.p  pWithin codeVE.shcode simply running codenpm installcode worked just fine under root. Under a nonroot sudoer an npm not found error was given. To attempt to fix this, instead of using the symlink to npm at codeusrlocalbinnpmcode I used the direct link to codeusrlocallibnodemodulesnpmbinnpmcli.jscode. However, this resulted in a node not found error. To solve this a symlink was created to node actual executable at codeusrlocalbinnodecode from codeusrbinnodecode. This made things work.p  pWhat could cause this to happen Both codeusrlocalbincode and codeusrbincode are in PATH by default. Adding a symlink from another place in PATH should have no effect, rightp  pA similar situation occurred first with Composer. The codecomposer.pharcode file was moved to codeusrlocalbincomposercode per the documentation, such that it does not need to be invoked via codephp composer.phar ltparamsgtcode but instead just by codecomposer ltparamsgtcode. This did not work, and instead during the initial install composer was always invoked by codephp sourcescomposer.phar ltparamsgtcode.p  pNote that this only happens during the initial install, and that after the codeinstall.shcode script is is done running then composer, npm and node can be accessed without any issues.p  pSome useful linksp  ul lia hrefhttpsgithub.comenterprisemediawikiMeza1blobb7336a8953b4b6d8280e7aeae7274c73bdff0169clientfilesVE.sh relnofollowVE.sh working for nonrootali lia hrefhttpsgithub.comenterprisemediawikiMeza1blob9806025134a2aeb2c8477282ce4a4ae3618dc445clientfilesVE.sh relnofollowVE.sh working just for rootali liSee the current 90 some of this text taken from itli liSee the original issue 68li ul

Negative 84518 pI have a Visual Studio installer in VS 2013. This works fine for Word 2010 and Word 2013 but on Word 2007 it doesnt install correctly although the installer runs and says its successfully installed. After install, when I open Word 2007, the addin isnt ticked. If I then tick the addin and press ok, nothing happens and then if I look again, the addin is no longer ticked. If I look in the registry, the install package has failed to create the registry setting I have in my install package. Even if I manually create these, I still have the same issue in Word which suggests something else in the installer hasnt works although it seems to have put all the files in the right place, so im quite confused.p  pNote that Im confident the addin itself is all fine in Word 2007 because when I build and run the addin with Word 2007, it all works correctly so i dont think there should be an issue with PIAs or any reference in the project etc.p  pAny help is much appreciated.p  pUPDATE When I change the installation setting to write to current user instead of local machine, the registry correctly gets written too and the addin appears ticked and can see the ribbon. However when running anything on the ribbon that reads the project settings, it doesnt work. I have found that double clicking the vsto file fixes this, but i shouldnt need to do this. p  pUPDATE2 I have found a solution to the second part of my question the need to double click the vsto for the settings to work. The manifest file if the registry must start file for Office 2007. p
Negative 84518 pIn my iOS app I have codeUICollectionViewcode that displays around 1200 small 35x35 points images. The images are stored in application bundle.p  pI am correctly reusing codeUICollectionViewCellcodes but still have performance problems that vary depending on how I address image loadingp  ul lipMy app is application extension and those have limited memory 40 MB in this case. Putting all 1200 images to Assets catalog and loading them using codeUIImagenamed imageNamecode resulted in memory crashes  system cached images which filled up the memory. At some point the app needs to allocate bigger portions of memory but these were not available because of cached images. Instead of triggering memory warning and cleaning the cache, operating system just killed the app.pli lipI changed the approach to avoid images caching. I put images to my project not to asssets catalog as png files and I am loading them using codeNSBundle.mainBundle.pathForResourceimageName, ofType pngcode now. The app no longer crashes due to memory error but loading of single image takes much longer and fast scrolling is lagging even on the newest iPhones. pli ul  pI have full controll over the images and can transform them for example to .jpeg or optimize them I already tried a hrefhttpsimageoptim.comImageOptima and some other options without success.p  pHow can I resolve both these performance problems at once p  hr  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pI also tried loading images in background thread.

But Im not sure how to plug it in.p  pI think codesortTypecode works on data fields, so in an codeinitComponentcode overload can I get access to what I need For example, this is how I override in the view to change the renderingp  precodeinitComponent function      this.callParent[]     this.columns[0].renderer          functionvalue, metaData, record, rowIdx, colIdx, store, view              var result               if Ext.isEmptyrecord.data ampamp Ext.isEmptyrecord.data.details                  var details  record.data.details                  value  details.name is first last, wont be using that                 result  details.last  ,   details.first                          return result           codepre  pCan I get access to the codedetails.namecode definition from here to override codesortTypecode Will agree that this emisntem the best approach, because Ill have to do some parsing of codenamecode to split it and then stick it back together. And thats going to have issues for those with multiple first andor last names.p  pAn alternate approach is to overload codedoSortcode but if I dont have access to codedetails.firstcode and codedetails.lastcode, it wont be any better than codesortTypecode. I saw one example of implementing codedoSortcode and it looks very complicated. Does anyone know of some detailed documentation for codedoSortcodep

Negative 84518 pGood morning Stack Overflow,p  pThis will be my first question and I am still learning coding, so please forgive me if Im ever being naive.p  pI am currently working on a modal that the user is shown when theyre trying to pick quantities of a certain product from a warehouse that has been stored in multiple locations. p  pThe user is given a requested quantity and the drop down menu shows each of the possible locations that they can retrieve an item from. The user will then select the location using the select menu and then adjust the slider with the amount they want to take from that location.p  pIf the user wants to split the requested amount across multiple locations however, they will click the Pick Another Location button and another row containing the select menu will appear directly underneath. The user will be able to do this until the total picked has reached the Quantity Requested or until they run out of locations to pick from. My problem is, I am trying to remove the location the user selected prior to clicking the Pick Another Location button.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.coma3ogW.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.coma3ogW.png altenter image description hereap  pAs you can see the same location appears again in the appended menu. I would like to have it so it doesnt. Its turning out to be quite difficult for me because each location picker has a unique ID that is created with a variable and I find it difficult to implement that into any types of condition usually.p  pI had a similar issue with the Quantity slider, as I was trying to treat each slider individually, but also contribute as a collective.

Negative 84518 pIve been trying to get a counter working along with waypoints in an animation. p  pThe jquery counter I use below works a charm with elements containing only numerals i.e. 8000. However Ive been asked to use a , as a separator as in 8,000. This throws the script out. Ive managed to use a function commaSeparateNumber to print a comma to the element when the counter is run i.e. 8000 becomes 8,000, which is great except for when javascript is not available and the fall back remains without the ,. p  pTherefore I need some help in first removing the comma from the target element and then running the counter along with the current function that places it back into the element. This will cover me for any fallbacks. p  pAny ideas are appreciated. Code is below. Thanksp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction            .Count.eachfunction                this.waypointfunction                   var this  this.element                 jQueryCounter 0.animateCounter this.text,                      delay 5000,                     duration 2000,                     easing swing,                     step function                           this.textcommaSeparateNumberMath.ceilthis.Counter                                                        function commaSeparateNumberval                      while dd3.testval.toString                          val  val.toString.replacedddddg, 1,                                          return val                                  this.destroy             ,                  offset 95                            ltscriptgt codepre
