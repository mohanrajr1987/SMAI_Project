Negative 25404 pI use MySQL in my ASP.NET app with the MySQL .NET Connector, is there anyway to programmatically check whether the db server is down I came across MySQLConnection.Ping but unfortunately that doesnt work the way it should the connection has to be opened first using Open, also it keeps on returning false even if the DB Server becomes available again. The only solution I came up with is to use the Open method, if that throws an exception then the DB server is not available, is there a more reliable way to do this I read somewhere that using Open might not work as expected if connection pooling is used, this could result an exception being thrown even if the DB server is up.p  pIf you want the details please read onp  pIn my app, I log all exceptions first I try to log them to the DB Server  could be the same DB Server thats down but could be not, depending on the configuration  if that fails the exceptions are logged to a text file. Now I want to handle the case if the DB server is down, normally what will happen is that exceptions will keep on being thrown with almost every request to my app, this means the log will be full with those exceptions, the other problem is that Ill keep on serving error pages to users or in other words the users will keep on seeing error pages with every request they make to the app, what I want to do is that if a db exception is thrown ie. of type MySQLException to check whether the DB server is up, if not then change some flag in my app and serve a page that contains something like the application is temporarily unavailable the flag is checked in an httpModule and redirects or transfers to that page. Im also planning to make it send me an SMS using an SMS proxy so that I could take an action, but this another story and is not related to this question.p

Negative 25404 pI have a set of call detail records, and from those records, Im supposed to determine the average concurrent active calls per system, per hour at a precision of one minute. If I query 7pm to 8pm, I should see the average concurrent calls for the hour averaging the concurrent calls for each minute within that hour for each system. p  pSo, I need a way to check for a count of active calls for 700701, 701702, etc then average those numbers. A call is considered active if the calls time and duration fall within the current minute being checked.p  pWhat makes this even more difficult is that it needs to span SQL 7.0 and SQL 2000 some functions in 2000 arent available in 7.0, such as GetUTCTime, if I can just get 2000 working Ill be happy.p  h2What approaches to this problem can I takeh2  pI thought about looping through minutes 60 in the hour being checked and adding the count of calls that fall between that minute and then somehow cross referencing the duration to make sure that a call that starts at 700 pm and has a duration of 300 seconds shows active at 704, but I cant imagine how to approach the problem. I tried to figure out a way to weight each call against particular minute that would tell me if the call was active during that minute or not, but couldnt come up with an effective solution. p  pThe data types here are the same as I have to query against.

Negative 25404 pDoes anyone know of a dll to defragment memory for a Windows 2003 serverp  pHeres the background We have a .net ecommerce site that uses a premade framework for most of the heavy lifting.  The website occasionally gets out of memory exceptions when trying to allocate memory when adding objects to the cache.  It mostly happens when the framework tries to add largeish datasets to the cache.p  pI understand that when you try to add something to the cache it needs to use contingious memory to add the object, if it cant find a big enough chunk of memory, youll get an outof memory exception.p  pThe server often gets this problem when IIS is consuming 600MB of memory already and needs 10 or 20 MB more.  The server has 4GB of memory so IIS should be able to use 2GB, but I think its these large objects that are having a problem find a place to fit.  So my hacky workaround is to maybe try to catch the exception, run a quick RAM defrag, and continue.p  pI know it would be best to use smaller objects, but I really dont want to have to reverseengineer the framework to replace parts of the caching code.p  pCheers, Lancep

Negative 25404 pIm reading an ebook on PHP right now, and the author noted that the difference between a while loop and a for loop is that the for loop will count how many times it runs.p  pSo take thisp  precodeltphp     for i  1 i lt 10 i  i  1          print Number in      gt  codepre  pBut wouldnt this be the same as p  precodeltphp     i  1         while i lt 10              i  i  1             print Number in          gt codepre  pOr is there some other differences that he didnt point out Aside from using while loop for when youre unsure of how long the condition will remain true, such as selecting rows from a databasep  pI mean, if thats the only difference, cant I just not use the for loop and use the while loop insteadp

Negative 25404 pUsing the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCSharp28programminglanguage29 relnofollowCa code below, how would you write it in Visual Basic What is it trying to sayp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.IO using System.Windows using System.Windows.Media using System.Windows.Media.Imaging  namespace Microsoft.LiveLabs.Pivot       ltsummarygt          Tile Builder class      ltsummarygt     public static class TileBuilder               ltsummarygt              Specifies which images are required in the images array used in CreateTile              according to the Morton fractal pattern used by Seadragon.          ltsummarygt          ltremarksgt              Usage of this and CreateTile are kind of tricky. Heres an example              Say you have a results set that is a collection of items like so  item1, item2, ..., item100               Since Seadragon expects the tiles to be laid out in a Morton pattern,              level 6 will look like the following                                     0   1   4   5   16  17...              2   3   6   7   18  19              8   9   12  13  24  25              10  11  14  15  26  27                            32  33  36  37  48  49              34  35  38  39  50  51...              .          .              .          .               .          .                        Each tile at level 6 is 4x4, so the dashes represent tile boundaries. Now, say               you want to build 0,0. You need the images on that tile. The ids 0, 1, 4, 5...               represent the ids in your result set,  item1, item2, ..., item100 . Calling               this method tells you the ids to use for a given tile. You then must retrieve               the necessary images out the result set, and supply them in the order this               method gave you to CreateTile. This will result in a correctly built tile               that Seadragon can use.          ltremarksgt          ltparam nameimageCountgtNumber of images in the full set.ltparamgt          ltparam namelevelgtThe level to which each image will be downsampled.ltparamgt          ltparam namerowgtThe row number which specifies what images to render.ltparamgt          ltparam namecolumngtThe row number which specifies what images to render.ltparamgt          ltparam nametileSizegtThe size of the tile to return.ltparamgt         public static IEnumerableltintgt GetTileIds           int imageCount,           int level,           int row,           int column,           int tileSize                       Calculate upperleft hand corner of tile in image space 1 unit  1 image             int levelSize  intMath.Pow2, level             int imagePerSide  tileSize  levelSize             int xOffset  row  imagePerSide             int yOffset  column  imagePerSide              if imagePerSide lt 0                              throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeExceptionLevel is greater than the maximum depth allowed by the tile size, or the tile size is 0.

Negative 25404 pIve designed my InApp purchase to work perfectly thanks to the wellwritten inApp Purchase Programming Guide.  Unfortunately, I have run into one last snag.  My app runs entirely offline except for this one purchase  so Im hoping theres a simple solution without having to implement tons of net code.p  pBasically, if I try to connect to make an inApp purchase with a device that is not connected to the internet, the timeout is ridiculously long 5 minutes on the SKProductsRequest.  My app is a free demo app, with only one purchase, so allowing the purchase to occur in the background is not ideal, as the user would be stuck in the app with limited functionality while they wait for the timeout explanation that they have no network connection.p  pIs there any easy way to test if the App Store is available on the device  [SKPaymentQueue canMakePayments] does not help here.  The code solutions I have seen have been extremely complicated.p  pIdeally, I would want to check this when a user enters the buydemo screen and I would pop up an alertview saying no network is available.p  pThanksp

Negative 25404 pA daft question, but I really cannot get this to work I have some longrunning process in a Swing application which may take several minutes. I want to display a progress dialog to the user while this process is ongoing. I also want to prevent the user from performing further actions, eg pressing a button while the process is going on.p  pIf I do the process on the EDT, this obviously prevents the enduser from doing anything while the process is going on. But because the EDT is busy processing, it never gets around to rendering the dialogs content, so I just get the outline of the dialog.p  pBut if I do the process in a worker thread, the enduser can click buttons and cause the EDT to manipulate state that the worker is also manipulating at the same time, with embad stuffem as a consequence. If I make the dialog modal, that does not happen, but emmodalem in Swing also implies emblockingem, so the moment I call codesetVisibletruecode, the thread blocks forever.p  pSo my current solution is to use a worker thread, and then spawn off a separate thread whose only purpose is to absorb the blocking nature of codesetVisiblecode. Surely there must be a better solutionp  pSo how do I get a dialog that prevents the user from interacting with the rest of the system modal but does not block the thread that causes it to be visiblep

Negative 25404 pHello and thanks for readingp  pI am building an HTML table based on the results of a query that returns XML that Im converting to an HTML table using XSL.  Ive been asked to add sorting, pagination and filtering.  I was able to add some javascript libraries to enable sorting and pagination, and a different library to enable the filtering.  However, since they are separate libraries, they do no cooperate, so when I filter, the table doesnt keep to the constraints of the entries per page field.  p  pI made some attempts at a few jQuery solutions, but couldnt get them to work.  What Im looking for is the best and naturally the easiest solution to adding pagination, column sorting and column filtering without the need to press enter or hit any buttons.  p  pThanks very much in advance and I hope everyone has a happy and healthy new yearp

One section has a zoomable codeUIScrollViewcode of a map thats pretty large 2437x1536. It chooses between pngs in an array.

Now Im using codeimageWithDatacode. The app hasnt crashed yet, but upon the 4th or 5th time of launching the map section, only some of the image appears, and theres flickering black areas.

Negative 25404 pWere going to add Fingerprint authentication to an iPad app Since we couldnt find any actual fingerprint hardware that works with an iPad, we found DigitalPersona, which is a supplier of great fingerprint scanner hardware, as well as an SDK for Linux CC. The idea is that the user would tap authenticate with fingerprint which would send a RESTful request to the linux box with the fingerprint scanner the linux box would be running the compiled C program which waits for a user to scan their finger, determines a match or nomatch, and send that response back to the iPad programs original request.p  pSo... with very little C experience, and even less CGI but lots of PHP and ObjectiveC, I was wondering if this is technically possible. Can a CGI binary accessed via HTTP actually wait for local user input at the console before sending the result to the HTTP requestp  pThe linux box would run headless, and wed control some LEDs to help with letting the user know that the program is waiting for a fingerprint scan.p  pSOME Additional Details  No PHP is planned on being used. Initially, we want three devices iPad Linux Serverp  piPad is running an app which would have a biometric authentication IBOutlet Linux has the fingerprint scanner on it, and a basic Apache additionally the C SDK for the finger print scanner, which we would use to build the CGI program that, when invoked by server, waits for a finger scanned, and once scanned, sends a match or no match to its requestor. Server would be the requestor. Once it receives a request from the iPad app, it invokes the CGI program on the Linux box, waiting for a match or no match request.p  pAnother member of my team offered this iPad is running the app user clicks auth with fingerprint and the iPad is in a waiting state Linux has the finger print scanner, user scans finger print, and the finger print gets sent via HTTPS to the server Server would receive a finger print, and match it up with a user. then checks if any iPad is in a waiting state, and which user initiated it. If it matches the finger printauthenticated user, it would accept the iPads data as an authentic punch, and release the iPad from the waiting state.p

Negative 25404 pSo I am coming back to Java after a few years of .NET programming and I am trying to update my Java knowledge but am having some problems with the now deprecated Date.parse function that I once knew.  I am trying to indiscriminately parse a string to a date.  I do NOT want to have to use the SimpleDateFormtter where I need to specify every acceptable format.  I just want to do what Date.parseString anyStringFormat to get epoch or new DateString anyStringFormat to get new date  what these guys used to do.  Every document I keep getting directed to says I have to use the  SimpleDateFormat with a specified date format.  I do not wish to use a specific date format  what is the new way to do this without a specific date format  I must be missing something, as I cant imagine they would remove such a feature.p

Negative 25404 pSo what I want to do is write an application that, at least in the future, could be ported to mobile platformssuch as android that can scan an image of a protein gel and return data such as the number of bandsie weights in a column, relative concentrationthickness of the band, and the weights of each in each column.p  pFor those who arent familiar, mixtures of denatured proteinsbasically, molecules made completed straight are loaded into each column, and with the use of electricity the proteins are pulled through a gelbecause the proteins are polar molecules. The end columns of each side of this image a hrefhttpi52.tinypic.com205cyrl.gif relnofollowhttpi52.tinypic.com205cyrl.gifa are where you place a mixture of proteins of known weightsso if you have 4 different weights, the band on top is the largest weight, and the weightsize of the protein decreases the further it travels down. Is something like this possible to analyze using OpenCV The given image is a really clean looking gel, they can often get really messysee google images. I figured if I allowed a user to enter the number of columns, which columns contain known weight markers and their actual weights, as well as provide an adjustable rectangle to size around the edges of the gel, that maybe it would be possible to scan and extract data from the images of these gels I skimmed through a textbook on OpenCV but I didnt see any obvious and reliable way I could approach this. Any ideas Maybe a different library would be better suitedp

Negative 25404 pIm trying to improve my mouse event knowledge so this question is about why what Im doing isnt working more than whether I could use a drag and drop module.p  pIm using Dojo and Ive connected to mousedown and mouseup events.  When there is a mousedown event thats not a right click, I set up a connection for mousemove.  On the subsequent mouseup event I disconnect that event.  This is what the code looks like EDIT made what should be a self contained examplep  precodeobj        init function         var c         dojo.connectdojo.doc, mousedown, this, functionevt             this.downevt             ifevt.button  dojo.mouseButtons.RIGHT                 this.isDown  true                 c  dojo.connectdojo.doc, mousemove, this, drag                               dojo.connectdojo.doc, mouseup, this, functionevt             dojo.disconnectc              this.isDown  false             this.upevt              ,end init      drag functionevt         console.logMouse drag,evt     ,      up functionevt         console.logMouse up,evt     ,      down functionevt         console.logMouse down,evt      end obj codepre  pEDIT to try this out, inject dojo on any page with an img with the console and then create this obj and run obj.init.  Inject with 1.5p  precodedocument.documentElement.firstChild     .appendChilddocument.createElementscript     .srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsdojo1.5dojodojo.xd.js codepre  pIt looks symmetric to me and works fine if I click over most of the document.  However if I click on an icon and drag it, the drag function is called only once the connection should have made it so every movement of the cursor called it, and the mouseup event isnt called when I release the mouse.p  pThen next time I mousedown it overwrites c with a new connection, making it so I cant ever disconnect the previous one and thus what I intended to only be active for dragging becomes a permanent event.p  pA bad solution Ive implemented is disconnecting before connecting in the mousedown connection.  That makes sure I dont get permanent calls to drag but still leaves me with rogue calls to drag until I click again to unset it.p  pAny tips to why this is happeningp

Negative 25404 pHow does one compares to the other I have an embedded application that if compiled and archived into a .jar with the regular Eclipse export tool will work fine in my emulator and subsequently, in the device itself.

Negative 25404 pThis is an interview questionagain. p  blockquote   pGiven a singly connected linked list, find the largest palindrome   in the list. You may assume the length of the palindrome is evenp blockquote  pThe first approach I made was using a stack  we traverse over the list from the start and keep pushing in the letters. Whenever we find the letter on the top of the stack is same as the next letter on the linked list, start poppingand incrementing the linked list pointer and set a count on the number of letters that matches. After we find a mismatch, push back all the letters that you popped from the stack, and continue your pushing and popping operations. The worst case complexity of this method would be On2 e.g. when the linked list is just a string of the same letters.  p  pTo improve on the space and time complexityby some constant factors, I proposed copying the linked list to an array and finding the largest sized palindrome in  the array which again takes On2 time complexity and On space complexity. p  pAny better approach to help me with  p

Negative 25404 pI am using the model first approach with entity framework 4.1 to generate my database in Visual Studio 2010. I am trying to edit the T4 DDL generation template that reads the edmx file.p  pThe reason i want to do this is because i want to put all the extra bits of metadata I have painstakingly put in entity model like summary and long description for all the entity properties into  the extended properties of the respective columns in my database on SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pI think Im on the right path but my only problem is that the templates themselves are coded in C and I know VB.net Ive tried using online converters but as the C is integrated within the template tags they just give me errors.p  pIm working with a copy of the standard SSDLtoSQL template theres not that much code, Does anyone know of anywhere i can get hold of this in VB.net language or could any one be kind enough to help me with the translationp  phope this is not too silly a question, im certainly no expert at this and it seems like im a vb newb in a C worldp  pThanks a lot for any help youd be doing me a huge favour.p

Negative 25404 pIn a particular scenario I have a lookup table with MachineNumber Varchar and its MachineID Int. In my transaction table I refer to the Machine number using lookup tables MachineID.p  pRequirement Can I have the MachineID field type set as Varchar in the transaction table whereas retaining its type as Int in the lookup table Reason, for some Machines the MachinNumber is not stored in the Lookup table and I need to store the actual MachineNumber provided by the user in the Transaction table itself and as the Machine number is alphanumeric I want to change the type of this referenced field from Int to Varchar.p  pIn a nutshell in the transaction table the MachineID field should contain both MachineID referenced from the lookup table and actual Machine Number provided by the user and stored directly herep  pQuestion Is it a good practice to have different types for these referenced fields or is it a common practice, what will be the effect on the queries with Join between these two tablesp  pThanks, Alindp

Negative 25404 pI am building a Java application that uses a shared library written in C and compiled for different operating systems.

Id rather load the needed shared libraries from a given path at runtime  just like a plugin. And no  i dont want any starter application that starts a new process with a new environment.

Of course Id prefer platform independent code, but if this aint possible, seperate solutions for Windows, Linux and MacOS would also do it.p  pstrongEDITstrong I should have mentioned that the shared library Id wish to use is object oriented, which  means that a binding of single functions wont do it.p

Negative 25404 pIm new to OpenGL and shaders. I have a project that involves using shaders to display cubes.p  pSo basically Im supposed to display eight cubes using a perspective projection at 10,10,10 from the origin each in a different color. In other words, there would be a cube centered at 10, 10, 10, another centered at 10, 10, 10 and so on. There are 8 combinations in 10, 10, 10. And then Im supposed to provide a key command c that changes the color of all the cubes each time the key is pressed.p  pSo far I was able to make one cube at the origin. I know I should use this cube and translate it to create the eight cubes but Im not sure how I would do that. Does anyone know how I would go about with thisp
Negative 25404 pAfter creating an opportunity, when I click on save, it gives me this warning for some users p  blockquote   pOperation prohibited by access rules, or performed on an already deleted document Operation read, Document type User Modification.p blockquote  pWhats causing this problemp  pstrongUpdatestrong I have created a new user of admin type and I added these groups SalesUser,SalesUser All Leads,SurveyUser,ToolsUser. It gives me a warning while creating an opportunity.p  pI added the following groups to the new user and its working fine Employee, PartnerManager, MarketingUser, AccountingAccountant, AccountingInvoice, AccountingManager, AdministrationAccess Rights, Human ResourceManager, Human ResourceUser, KnowledgeUser, MarketingManager, ProjectManager, SalesManager, ToolsManager, trimaxAdminMeeting, TrimaxSalesExecutive, TrimaxVertical, TrimaxSalesHead, TrimaxSalesManager, UseabilityAnalyticAccounting, UseabilityExtended, View, UseabilityMultiCompanies, UseabilityNo One, UseabilityProduct Uos View, UseabilityProduct Variant, WarehouseManager, WarehouseUser, ToolsUser, AdministrationConfigurationp  pBut in already created user if I remove the above groups which give warning ,then also it shows same warning.p  pThe solution I mentioned above was for new users,but for some existing users it was still giving problem. So I removed some unwanted groups, which I didnt needed for those users and it worked, now it does not show warning. Was the warning due to some access right overlap or something elsep

Negative 25404 pLATEST check code at the bottom for my hack solution..p  pORIGINAL Ive followed some tutorials and examples and went and made my own database.  The problem is that when I download the database to the phone its supposed to be read and fill a spinner.. ive found that the downloaded database is intact but when it gets read by the dbhelper it somehow gets rewritten into a blank table.  I cant understand why.p  pEDIT1 Im sorry, I should have been more clear. The database is coming from a server. it is downloaded directly to datadataprojectdatabases . Thats where I checked the file after it was downloaded. It was good until I called DbAdapter mDbHelper  new DbAdaptercontext mDbHelper.opennames after which the Android Metadata table and names table and sqlite table are still in the database, the columns have names, but there are no entries so the table is essentially blank. p  pEDIT2 sorry so lengthyp  pI commented back in the following        p  precodec  initSpinnerc codepre  pits a method I wrote in case the cursor returned  moveToFirst . in this method the database is created and add name is inserted into the table. p  pI then played with the app a little and this is what I foundp  pwhen i first open the app on my device, on a clean install, the spinner shows the default add a name. so i add a name.. I reopen the app and the name i entered is there along with add a name... go to the emulator after clearing all the data and uninstalling.. open the app and only add a name is there.. back out and reopen and the spinner has add a name and the name i entered on my phone... so i add a name on the emulator, go back to my phone and close and reopen the app and there are now 2 names and add a name... p  pSummary It works but I have to reopen the app after the initial install to read the db and populate the spinner correctly.

Negative 25404 pI was planning to develop an ecommerce  website which might take me 8 months12 months I work on this project part time to build the prototype. I havent decided yet if I can do that alone or with a 34 team of colleagues. The website will be owned by me or with 34 other colleagues. I believe if I am going to use the best resources I can find, the website might get hundred thousands of customers in the near future. p  pHowever, I am just an Application developer 3 years of Java experience and I dont know more about Architectural staffs. So, I am seeking an advice how to build this system from the scratch and make it available for customers before 2013.p  pI am also focused on the future challenges I might face. So, instead of building the system quickly which might fail in the future or might cost a lot of effort, time, and money to manage it, I would rather build it in a timely manner, carefully, and by using the entire available source I can afford. p  pBelow are a list of things which you might consider giving me your advice on.    Using FreeSources starting from IDE, to plugins and so onp  p   How much effort, time and money should I budget.p  p   How to build the Architecture so that the system will be more extensible and easy  to manage in the future.p  p   Which languages to use am good  OOP languages like Java, and a little bit of Grails p  p   I also considered the app to be accessible via Mobile phones p  p   Making the system cloud based.p  p   Which Databases either Schema based or Schema less and Servers to consider.p  p   Security issuesp  p   Should I use Test Driven Developmentp  p   How about documentationp  p   What frameworks to use, instead of inventing the wheels from the scratch. Like for security purpose I might consider Shiro framework, and so on.p  p   Use of patterns and algorithms.p  p   In the future if the project went well and needs some more experts, I planned to make it open source.p  p   How to use social networking features.p  p   And any of your comments.p  pbr I would prefer if you are a professional and have an experience with different technologies in the past few years. Even if you tell me your past experience, I will appreciate that.Thank you for your time.p

On most platforms, signed char will be an 8bit twos complement number 128 to 127, and unsigned char will be an 8bit unsigned integer 0 to 255.p  pIf that is the case, is there a possibility that codestr[i]code will return a negative number and cause a memory fault in codeispresent[str[i]]code or is the codecharcode getting typecast to codevectorltboolgtsizetypecode which is codeunsignedcode and hence no problems can occurp  pAlso, is it better to use codevectorltboolgt ispresentpow2, CHARBIT, falsecode instead of hardcoding it to 256p

Negative 25404 pI need to read out users from an old database to use for statistics in a new system, but I do not have the original user table. However there is a statistics table with the sum of each year, where I also can find all needed user information. In addition this also only give me the users that were active, which is what I need.p  pThe table has the following relevant columns the statistics columns are not relevant herep  ul liUserIDli liFirstNameli liLastNameli liEmailli liYearli ul  pI want UserID to be distinct, so it is the only column that I can have in GROUP BY. I will run MAX on Year, to get the values from the most recent year. FirstName, LastName and Email need to be the same as the row where MAXYear. In other words people may have changed both names and emails during the years, and I only want the last one, as its the only one that is relevant.p  pMy best suggestion for a SQL query goes like thisp  precodeSELECT UserID, Firstname, LastName, Email, MAXYear AS Year FROM myTable GROUP BY UserID ORDER BY LastName, FirstName codepre  pThe only problem is that SQL Server 2008 will not let me do anyhing like that, because all columns either has to be with a function like MAX or a part of GROUP BY. The columns FirstName, LastName and Email cant be under GROUP BY because that will make too many records. It seems somehow to work to put MAX on all of them, but then I have no way of knowing which column the MAX function is actually working on. I do not know for sure that it will be a problem, but I dont have time to look through 100 000 rows to see if there actually is a problem.p  pSo in short I want the whole row of five columns where MAX works on only one column and GROUP BY on another. Does anybody have a good solution, or is it actually safe to use MAX on all nongrouping rowsp
Negative 25404 pstrongBackground Informationstrongp  pIm currently taking a computer graphics class. The way were learning the main concepts is by making an abstraction that anyone could use aka a simple 3D library. Were using SDL for the real graphics part. Actually, all we use SDL for is to render and manipulate a pixel buffer. Were only allowed to use that. But our abstraction is supposed to allow the client to draw pixels, lines, triangles, etc. all the way to complete models composed of those triangles. p  pThings were going along pretty smoothly... until the professor took a look at my abstraction. He said it wasnt very object oriented. p  pstrongMy Questionstrongp  pIm not looking so much for a review of my code, as Im looking for some general advice and suggestions on how to design this SDL library using sound Object Oriented principles.p  pstrongWhat I have so farstrongp  pMy code actually makes good use of some object oriented principles. I have the following objects working fine so farp  ul liVec4  represents coordinates or colors. It does operations related to vectors. li liMat4  represents a 4x4 matrix that I use for transformations and such. Does operations related to matrices, such as multiply by another matrix, by a vec4, etc.li liMatrixFactory  creates different types of Mat4 MatrixTranslate, MatrixRotate, etcli liShape  an interface used to make drawing various shapes easier ul liDot  Shapeli liLine  Shapeli liTriangle  Shapeli ulli ul  pMy engine itself does the following based somewhat on the a hrefhttpaerotwist.comlabgettingstartedwiththreejs relnofollowthree.jsa structurep  ul liCreates a window the main window where things are drawnli liCreates a scene where shapes are displayedli liRegisters callback functions based on keyboard events key pressesli ul  pstrongWhere Im struggling specificallystrongp  pThe main thing Im struggling with so far is handling callbacks. For instance, to draw a triangle, I currently do something like the followingp  precodeint main       Create instance of my library     RDL rdl  new RDLWIDTH, HEIGHT, 32         Draw a triangle when T is pressed      RDLKEYt  define RDLKEYt SDLKt for consistency      rdlgtregisterKeyEventRDLKEYt, drawTriangle      rdlgtshow      return 0     X, Y, Z and R, G, B are random values not shown for simplicity void drawTriangleRDL rdl      RDLPoint p1Vec4X, Y, Z, Vec4R, G, B     RDLPoint p2Vec4X, Y, Z, Vec4R, G, B     RDLPoint p3Vec4X, Y, Z, Vec4R, G, B      rdlgtinsertShapeRDLTrianglept1, pt2, pt3  codepre  pInside RDLshow I run the standard SDL loop where I do 2 thingsp  ul liCall any registered callbacksli liDrawn shapes in my vector where all shapes are storedli ul  pBut this is no good. If I insert 10 triangles, they all draw nicely. But if I want to rotate a specific one, I cant do that because my callbacks only give me access to my RDL object from main. p  pAny ideas, tips, or general advicep  pThank you very much.

Negative 25404 pIve been working on a handful of ASP.NET user controls which will be integrated into a Sitecore CMS instance. Development has been completed using some dummy aspx pages to host the controls and everything works fine locally and when the project is deployed onto a test server.p  pHowever, when we integrate the modules into Sitecore a few actions cause an Invalid Viewstate exception  Invalid character in base64 string. I have replicated this locally, i.e. on my dev system, by configuring IIS to look at the Sitecore project so this leads me to believe that it is not a server issue but obviously I cant be sure of that.p  pUsing fiddler I can see that the POST request contains not one but two VIEWSTATE fields, indeed EVENTVALIDATION, EVENTTARGET and EVENTARGUMENT have two instances each in the request. The VIEWSTATE values are identical and I can decode the content hence I assume that the failure is due to the presence of two values, not an error in either one of them. The two EVENTVALIDATION values are different but both are valid i.e. they decode and the other EVENT fields are empty.p  pIf I remove the UpdatePanels from the control then eveything works OK  obviously there are no AJAX partial page updates now though which is not ideal. If I disable Jscript in my browser with the UpdatePanels back in the code, then again everything is OK.p  pCan anyone shed some light on this or point me in the right direction  Im out of ideas now and if I cant sort it Ill have to remove the UpdatePanels and see if we can live with the result, not ideal.p  pstrong[Update 14022012]strong Ive been trawling the web but have not really found anyone with the same problem. I thought Id struck gold a hrefhttpsitecoretips.blogspot.com200908usingaspnetajaxupdatepanelwith.html relnofollowwith this posta but again it made no difference to my problem. All indications are that AJAX on Sitecore should work fine but so Im guessing that we must have a configuration problem. Problem is that Im not a Sitecore developer and currently I dont have access to one annual leavep

Negative 25404 pLets say I have the following kind of strange core data schemap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvVecb.png altenter image description herep  pIn this model, there are Accounts, and Activities which share a parent entity of Item. In addition there is a Relationship entity that models the relationships between objects instead of letting core data model the relationships using real relationships. In other words, the Relationship entity is being used as a kind of join table.p  pGiven this model, how can I fetch objects based on related objects For instance, stronghow would I fetch all the Accounts that have an Activity that occurs todaystrong p  pThere doesnt seem to be any way to do this in a single fetch request. The best thing I can think of so far is to first fetch the activities that occur today, then the relationships where the toId matches the ids of those Activities, and then finally the accounts where the id is matches the fromId in the relationships.p  p3 fetch requests to do this is suboptimal. Were going to need to support account and activity counts in the hundreds of thousands and doing all that fetching will potentially be really slow. Its also awkward to use NSFetchedResultsController with this kind of model.p  pYes I know this isnt how Core Data likes to do things, but for a variety of reasons involving our server architecture and cross platform support we would like to use this data model and Core Data due to all the nice things it provides. Thanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 25404 pIm using the out of the box Asp.Net Membership functionality to handle my user management and role management.p  pMy application consists of a single database for each client and each database has its own Membership provider and role provider.p  pHowever, there are some users who work for more than one of the clients and I want to be use a single login and let them choose which client to view. I have everything setup to facilitate this client switching by using an intermediate database that stores all usernames and a relation to which clients they have access to. I also have it setup so any updates to a user in one database will update all of the corresponding users in the other databases. All of this logic is working very well, except that I cant seem to figure out how to tell ASP.Net to change to a specific MembershipProvider and use that one.p  pThe process I thought I should use is as follows when the user switches the client in the clients dropdownp  ul liLog the current user outli liTell ASP.Net which Membership provider to use selected based on the client chosen in the dropdownli liLog the current user in using the selected clients membership provider and refreshredirect to the page they were viewing when they changed the dropdownli ul  pI know how to get a reference to the specific membership provider Membership.Providers[MembershipProviderName], but I cant find any information on how to tell ASP.Net to change its membership provider. Im not really even sure how the asp.net Login control does this in the background either  something that would probably help me out in all of this.p  pIve been searching SO and the web for awhile and cant seem to find much about doing this other than a few threads where people are trying to modify the DefaultProvider attribute of the Providers element in their Web.config.p

Negative 25404 pI think my question is simple for js experts I am a beginner in js.p  pIn my script I dynamically create a table.

Negative 25404 pI am somewhat new to MVVM Light and having fun coming up to speed. I have a question about the creation of the creation of public properties of the app object, as compared to creation of ViewModels through the Locator. Specifically...p  pThe examples I see have the Locator being created as an app resource in the app.xaml file. My problem is that it is created before app public properties are created. I have a static property of the app object which holds a collection. Because this property is created AFTER the Locator service is created I cant refer to it in the constuctor of any of the View Models created by the Locator.p  pAll of which has me wondering if I am doing things wrong In my app I have a collection that I want to use pretty much anywhere. My plan was that each ViewModel I only have a few will copy this object in their constructor. On reflection, thats probably broken  I should probably be passing back references to the app property through my ViewModel, rather than taking a copy, rightp  pAnyway, I guess I have two questionsp  ol liHow can I deal with ViewModels that need to access properties of the app object, given that the Locator and its ViewModels are created earlier.li liWhats the general pattern here when I have an appwide property that I want all ViewModels to exposeli ol  pThanks in advance.p  pMarkp

I mean inside each method I have created a new DbContext and done database jobs .p  pI searched the web . first I came to use repository and Unit of Work patterns but I figured out that DbContext itself is a unit of work and its dbset works as repositories . another point is that I think there is no need to test Linq part because it works as it should  tested by .net team  .

For example i load a small form with unobtrusive validation into the dialog. No body, head etc, only a container div and the form itself. By default validation dont work and if i add event handlers for the form under script.js function it dont fire. If i add the following js references and codeblock to be loaded with the form it works with one problemp  precodeltscript srcScriptslibsjquery.validate.min.jsgtltscriptgt             ltscript srcScriptslibsjquery.validate.unobtrusive.jsgtltscriptgt             ltscript typetextjavascriptgt                 function                       formCreate.submitfunction e                          e.preventDefault                                                   ltscriptgt codepre  pThe non functioning regarding the code above is that validation will always work but if i open the dialog, close it, then open it again, the preventdefault will stop working and the form will post. Could this perhaps be a multiple load of script issue or something Though since no doc ready code works in dialog if placed in scripts.js standard javascript functions work though i dont really have another option.  Is there a better way to work with javascript inside dynamically loaded files or do i have to place the entire forms in the parent page to be able to work against them reliably  Any input on how you should handle thisp

Negative 25404 pI was wondering if its possible to Style a Drop Down List in Excel. The text is rather small and has no styling and I was wondering if the drop down list styling could be changed p  pWhat would actually make sense is if the drop down list items copied the same styling as its source cells, i.e. alternating background colour of cells, font, size, etc. Or even the copying of the style of the validation cell itselfp  pIs there any way to change this using VBA or any other 3rd party method p

Negative 25404 pDisclaimer I am a total CoreData noob. I am running my app on an iPhone 4S with iOS 6.0.1.p  h2Backgroundh2  pA part of my app acquires images using a codeUIImagePickercode and saves them to disk using CoreData. Said images are associated with Activities in the model. Activities have a onetomany relationship with Images.p  pI need to save images to disk immediately after capture and then fault them out of memory, retaining a thumbnail for display. If I do not, iOS will kill my app for using too much memory after a relatively small number of images have been captured.p  pI made Thumbnails a separate entity to avoid needing to bring the entire image into memory in situations when all I need is the thumbnail. Thumbnails have a onetoone relationship with Images. Also, for various reasons I am not using Core Data to store the thumbnail image data instead, I store the filename, and manage the files on disk myself.p  pAll of this means that, should the user cancel adding an Activity after they have already added at least one Image, then both the Images and the Thumbnails that the user added need to be deleted.p  h2Problemh2  pWhen I try to delete the added image objects, two things happen.

It works fine on the initial load but then I lose the value of user. The app is a multi page iframe app meaning its like a little mini website with three pages. The user goes to the welcome page, then can go to a vote page or an enter page. I just load the facebook.php and info in the first page because it was giving me errors when I had a connect.php which has the facebook SDK info as well as my MySQL log in info in the other files. I suppose it because facebook.php is being called more than oncep  pNow the issue is that I can access the userprofile on the main page but cant on the other pages. Im assuming this is because its not querying the facebook.php file but I cant put the facebook.php file on those pages because I get an error. The error it gives me is whatever I put in the die section of the if statement. Basically user is not getting set. I wanted to try to avoid using the Javascript SDK so I can keep everything server side.p  pI saw this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9906475permissionsnotgettingcarriedoverwhenvisitinganewpagewhileusingfaceboPermissions not getting carried over when visiting a new page while using facebook39s php sdka Which is close to the same problem but not exactly the same.

For example, table answersp  precodeuserid unique companyid unique q1 q2 q3 ... q100 codepre  pThe answers table will only have a unique row per company. If an user edits the questionaire then the row will be transfered to a history table and a new row will be inserted again.

Negative 25404 pI have some Java Swing login panel. When user click login button, extensive DB communication takes place. I got an idea to put that db communication into another thread that db communication is used for filling some hash maps and singletons. After putting that communication into separate thread, db heavy lifting takes place while user is typing its uname and password. When user clicks login button, than code will wait for heavy lifting thread to join, and then proceed.p  pThe problem is that while my code is waiting for db thread to join, it seems that no UI updates can be done. I dont think i can use SwingWorker for db communication because user can click login button any time, even before SW would finish and i dont have a way to join SwingWorker db communication has to take place BEFORE actual login.p  pIs there a way to enable Swing ui updates while waiting for another thread to join Am i missing somethingp

Negative 25404 pIve been working on learning to strongdeliver and display data in realtime over websocketsstrong. Realtime, in this context, just means that the data is being read from a sensor camera with image processing every strong.03 to 1 secondsstrong.

The result plus a little theme change looks pretty goodp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhd8vW.png altYes I know its not quotrandom dataquot.p  pOpen question remains strongIs it expected that a websocket can deliver information out of orderstrong Or is there something wrong with my implementation on the server side or Alchemy. I will investigate further when I have time.p  h1strongSOLUTIONstrongh1  pI figured it out After a lot of testing, I realized that my Connection object which is responsible for watching a data set for new data and sending it as is appropriate given how the connection is configured was implemented using a Timer object. This was something I took from an example normally I just use the Thread object for most things asynchronous. p  pAs the Timer object speeds up, it starts executing asynchronously with its previous calls to its Tick function. This means that very occasionally, one call to its Tick function will happen a little faster than another due to the latency in the Alchemy Send function. This causes minor out of order problems.p  pstrongI switched the implementation of the communication loop from a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.timer.aspx relnofollowTimera object to a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.thread.aspx relnofollowThreada object, thus enforcing synchronization, and the out of order packets went awaystrongp

Negative 25404 pIve managed over the past few months to teach myself PHP, PDO amp SQL, and have built a basic dynamic website with user registrationemail activation and login logout functionality, following PHPSQL best practices. Now Im stuck on the next task... p  pIve created a huge dataset of squarespolygons 3 million, each 1 minute of latitude amp longitude in size, stored in a PHP array with a single set of coordinates the top left corner. To extrapolate a squarelike shape, I simply add 0.016 degrees 1 minute to each direction and generate the other 3 coordinates. p  pI now need to check that each polygon in said array is over at least some portion of land in the United States.... i.e. if one were to produce a graphical output of my completed data set and take a look at the San Fransisco coastline, theyd see something like a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comvrgwP.jpgthisa.p  pIts similar to the pointinpolygon problem, except its dealing with another polygon instead of a point, the other polygon is a country border, and Im not just looking at intersections. I want to check ifp  ul liA polygonsquare intersects with the polygon. Think coastlineborder.li liA polygonsquare is inside the polygon. Think continental U.S..li liA polygonsquare contains part of the polygon. Think small island.li ul  pThis is illustrated with my crudely drawn imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUfJUc.png altThis is not easyp  pIf it matches any of these three conditions, I want to keep the square. If it does not interact with the big polygon in anyway i.e. its over water, discard it. p  pI was thinking the big polygon would be a shapefile of the U.S., that or a KML file which I could strip the coordinates out of to create a very complex polygon from. p  pThen, I thought Id pass these matching squares and square IDs over striketo a csv file for integrationstrike into a MySQL table containing a set of coordinates of each square in fact, Im not even sure of the best practices for handling tables of that size in MySQL, but Ill come to that when need be. The eventual goal would then be to develop a map using Google Maps API via Javascript to display these squares over a map on the website Im coding obviously only showing squares within the viewpoint to make sure I dont tax my db to death. Im pretty sure Id have to pass such information through PHP first, too.

Negative 25404 pI am currently doing a project on iOS. The app I am developping is supposed to take a picture from a check cheque, and read the CMC7 number wich is written at the bottom of the check.p  pCurrently, I am working on it with openCV, because of the work that was previously done on the project before I arrived, but p  pIs openCV better than Tesseract for that kind of job p  pThe difficulty here consists in the font that is used, which is this one  a hrefhttpwww.dafont.comfrcmc7.font relnofollowhttpwww.dafont.comfrcmc7.fonta As you can imagigne, usual OCR cant regognise this font because of its shape. I think that the best way to do this job is to use the barcode of the font in order to recognise it, and not using the shape of the characters.p  pThe think is that from what I know, Tesseract can recognise different kinds of fonts, and we can train it to a specific font, but what about this font that is used for the CMC7 If I want to work on the barcode, is there a way to do it with Tesseract, or cant it only be used for font recognition p  pThank you very much.p

Negative 25404 pIm working with some C code that implements a graph algorithm that uses a lot of small chunks of memory a relative of gSpan, but that doesnt matter.  The code is implemented in C and uses stdvectors to store many small elements on the order of 64 bytes each.  However, Im using this on much larger data sets than the original authors, and Im running out of memory.  p  pIt appears, however, that Im running out of memory prematurely. Fragmentation I suspect it is because stdvectors are trying to increase in size every time they need more memory, and vectors insist on contiguous memory.  I have 8GB of ram and 18GB of swap, yet when stdbadalloc is thrown, Im only using 6.5GB resident and 8GB virtual.

Negative 25404 pI am working on a project in MVC2, I have a controller action to respond to a jQuery AJAX call which returns a JSON respose. One of the properties in my JSON is extremely long can be 500k characters, and seems to be clipped to a max length of 43676 characters after reaching my Jquery AJAX success function.p  pI have done a lot of debugging, and as far as I can tell, the controller is passing the JSON correctly to the client. I can capture the network response in IE dev tools and see that the JSON is still valid. But once it reaches my JavaScript one of the properties is shortened.p  pBelow is some example code to try and explain a bit better.p  precode MVC2 Controller action public ActionResult MyAction       Generate a simple object with a few properties     object response  GetResponse             make the return string max length huge     JavaScriptSerializer serializer  new JavaScriptSerializer  MaxJsonLength  Int32.MaxValue      ContentResult result  new ContentResult              ContentType  applicationjson,         Content  serializer.Serializeresponse          return result    Example of the response object class response      public string Property1     public string Property2     public string Property3    jQuery AJAX call  .ajax     type POST,     url HomeMyAction,     dataType json,     success functionresults          Accessing a JSOn property that comes after the long one still works fine         ifresults.Property3  Success              Do something with one of the JSON properties             MyDiv1.valresults.Property1              I get a JS error here because my HTML is invalid due to the string being clipped             MyDiv2.htmlresults.Property2                codepre  pI have simplified my code a lot to try and make this clear. I have a very long html string in Property2, but it is being shortened to 43676 characters. I am really not sure what is happening at this point. The thing that confuses me is that the controller action seems to pass the correct JSON to the client, and more confusingly, the long JSON property Property2 is in the middle of my JSON somewhere, and this is the only value that gets affected. If the JSON was just too long, wouldnt the properties after my long value also be missing Does jQuery AJAX or JSON in general have a max length on propertiesp

Negative 25404 pHere is my problem. I am working with an external consultant, who created some code that he keeps in a GIT repo on github.

This does not have to be automatic whenever he updates github  I just want to have a fairly simple process that I can run to merge his changes into my internal SVN repo. Note that I will also be making changes myself to the code in the SVN repo, so I cant just mirror his github git repo to SVN every time he makes changes.

Negative 25404 h2Short problem descriptionh2  pCan I extend UIView with a category, but have it only work on subclasses that implement a specific protocol codeWritableViewcodep  pI.e. can I do something like the followingp  precodeinterface UIViewltWritableViewgt foo  SYNTAX ERROR  voidsetTextToDomainOfUrlNSString text  voidsetTextToIntegerValueNSIntegervalue  voidsetCapitalizedTextNSString text end implementation UIViewltWritableViewgt foo  implementation of 3 above methods would go here end codepre  hr  h2Detailed problem descriptionh2  pImagine I want the following category function added to any instance of codeUILabelcodep  precode[label setTextToDomainOfUrlhttpgoogle.com] codepre  pWhich simply sets a UILabels codetextcode property to codegoogle.comcode.p  pSimlarly, I want to be able to call this function on several other classesp  precode[button setTextToDomainOfUrlhttpapple.com]  same as [button setTitleapple.com forStateUIControlStateNormal] [textField setTextToDomainOfUrlhttpexample.com]  same as textField.text  example.com [tableViewCell setTextToDomainOfUrlhttpstackoverflow.com]  same as tableViewCell.textLabel.text  stackoverflow.com codepre  pLets say Im really happy with my design so far, and I want to add 2 more methods to all 4 classesp  precode[label setTextToIntegerValue5]  same as label.text  [NSString stringWithFormatd, 5] [textField setCapitalizedTextabc]  same as textField.text  [abc capitalizedString] codepre  pSo now we have 4 classes that have 3 methods each. If I wanted to actually make this work, I would need to write 12 functions 43. As I add more functions, I need to implement them on each of my subclasses, which can quickly become very hard to maintain. p  pInstead, I want to implement these methods only once, and simply expose a new category method on the supported components called codewriteTextcode. This way instead of having to implement 12 functions, I can cut the number down to 4 one for each supported component  3 one for each method available for a total of 7 methods that need to be implemented.p  pNote These are silly methods, used just for illustrative purposes. The important part is that there are many methods in this case 3, which shouldnt have their code duplicated.p  pMy first step at trying to implement this is noticing that the first common ancestor of these 4 classes is codeUIViewcode. Therefore, the logical place to put the 3 methods seems to be in a category on codeUIViewcodep  precodeinterface UIView foo  voidsetTextToDomainOfUrlNSString text  voidsetTextToIntegerValueNSIntegervalue  voidsetCapitalizedTextNSString text end  implementation UIView foo  voidsetTextToDomainOfUrlNSString text      text  [text stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfStringhttp withString]  just an example, obviously this can be improved      ... implement more code to strip everything else out of the string     NSAssert[self conformsToProtocolprotocolWritableView], Must conform to protocol     [idltWritableViewgtself writeTexttext]   voidsetTextToIntegerValueNSIntegervalue      NSAssert[self conformsToProtocolprotocolWritableView], Must conform to protocol     [idltWritableViewgtself writeText[NSString stringWithFormatd, value]]   voidsetCapitalizedTextNSString text      NSAssert[self conformsToProtocolprotocolWritableView], Must conform to protocol     [idltWritableViewgtself writeText[text capitalizedString]]  end     codepre  pThese 3 methods will work as long as the current instance of UIView conforms to the codeWritableViewcode protocol. So I extend my 4 supported classes with the following codep  precodeprotocol WritableView ltNSObjectgt  voidwriteTextNSString text end  interface UILabel fooltWritableViewgt end  implementation UILabel foo  voidwriteTextNSString text      self.text  text  end  interface UIButton fooltWritableViewgt end  implementation UIButton foo  voidwriteTextNSString text      [self setTitletext forStateUIControlStateNormal]  end   similar code for UITextField and UITableViewCell omitted codepre  pAnd now when I call the followingp  precode[label setTextToDomainOfUrlhttpapple.com] [tableViewCell setCapitalizedTexthello] codepre  pIt works Hazzah Everything works perfectly... until I try thisp  precode[slider setTextToDomainOfUrlhttpapple.com] codepre  pThe code compiles since codeUISlidercode inherits from codeUIViewcode, but fails at run time since codeUISlidercode doesnt conform to the codeWritableViewcode protocol. p  pWhat I would really like to do is make these 3 methods only available to those UIViews which have a codewriteTextcode method implemented I.e. those UIViews which implement the codeWritableViewcode protocol I set up. Ideally, I would define my category on UIView like the followingp  precodeinterface UIViewltWritableViewgt foo  SYNTAX ERROR  voidsetTextToDomainOfUrlNSString text  voidsetTextToIntegerValueNSIntegervalue  voidsetCapitalizedTextNSString text end codepre  pThe idea is that if this were valid syntax, it would make code[slider setTextToDomainOfUrlhttpapple.com]code fail at compile time since codeUISlidercode never implements the codeWritableViewcode protocol, but it would make all my other examples succeed.p  pSo my question is is there any way to extend a class with a category, but limit it to only those subclasses that have implemented a specific protocolp  hr  pI realize I could change the assertion which checks that it conforms to the protocol to an codeifcode statement, but that would still allow the buggy UISlider line to compile. True, it wont cause an exception at runtime, but it wont cause anything to happen either, which is another kind of error I am also trying to avoid.p  pSimilar questions that havent been given satisfactory answersp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16682342categoryforaclassthatconformstoaprotocolCategory for a class that conforms to a protocola This question seems to be asking the same thing, but didnt give specific examples, so it seems like it was misunderstood to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5824755canacategoryimplementaprotocolinobjectivecmean something elsea.li lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1521267definingcategoriesforprotocolsinobjectivecDefining categories for protocols in ObjectiveCa Different example provided, so the accepted answer says to implement it in the category of each class that needs the method i.e. you would end up with 12 methods in my example which is a totally fine answer for that one, but not really a good solution for this problem.li lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7209967howdoidefineacategorythataddsmethodstoclasseswhichimplementaparticrq1How do I define a category that adds methods to classes which implement a particular protocola The asker chose to go the route of checking for implementation of the protocol and doing nothing if it doesnt conform, but what if you want it to spot errors at compile timeli ul

Negative 25404 pso I have a quick question for anyone willing to help. When I am programming in a regular text editor, I often find myself wanting to copy multiple lines of code, concatenating them on the fly and then being able to paste their contents just like I would normally use CommandcCommandv.p  pI think this would be done in Applescript and then assigned a custom shortcut with Quicksilver but I am not too familiar with either. Below is an example to illustrate the desired behavior.p  precodeCopyConcatenate with CommandCX  Paste with CommandV  Clear Clipboard when regular CommandC is used  so... CommandCX First line ... CommandCxSecond line ... CommandV pastes First lineSecond line and CommandCThird line... CommandV pastes Third line codepre  pCan someone help me accomplish this or set me on the right path Thank you in advance.p

Negative 25404 pHey so Im working on pausing my game. I have it almost working, but theres a couple malfunctions that I cant seem to understand. p  pBasically I have some code below that pauses the frame rate and then resumes the frame rate. Both snippets of code work correctly individually, but when put together, if I press p it instantly cycles through both snippets of code, effectively only executing the second one I put traces in and it shows that both codes are being executed when I press p once.p  pSo my first and primary question is how do I get this to work I just want to execute one snippet of the code when p is pressed to pause the game, and then after that occurs, be able to press p again and execute the other snippet. p  pMy second question is...why when I trace the frame rate does it say it is 0.01 instead of 0 Found this sort of interesting....Anyways, heres the code. Tell me if you need more context, but I dont think you will. p  precode        if stage.frameRate  30                      if keyboardEvent.keyCode  Keyboard.P                              dispatchEventnew NavigationEventNavigationEvent.PAUSEGAME                 stage.frameRate  0                 checkIfPaused  true                 tracepause game                 tracestage.frameRate                               if stage.frameRate  0.01                      if keyboardEvent.keyCode  Keyboard.P                              stage.frameRate  30                 dispatchEventnew NavigationEventNavigationEvent.RESUMEGAME                 checkIfPaused  false                 traceresume game                       codepre

Negative 25404 pIve got a piece of code that wants to perform a jump to a particular id on the page as soon as the page is ready. I accomplish this by performing a codejquery.animatecode so that the codescrollTopcode is at my target element.p  pHowever, Im using web fonts, and for some reason the codereadycode event is firing embeforeem the web fonts have loaded and been applied. The result is that the animation ends on a position that is often completely unrelated to the actual position of the element I want to scroll to.p  pIve verified this by opening the timeline in the Chrome inspector, where I see the animation triggering, followed by the web font loading, followed by a rerender which causes my animation target scroll point to become meaningless. Ive also confirmed that this issue does not manifest itself when I use a system font.p  pCould anyone offer some advice Perhaps theres some sort of event that fires after a web font has been appliedp

Negative 25404 pI have a signal x[n] , n1...N, N10000. Assume that I know few samples at index i1, i2,.. ik , Can  i use these samples to get back x roughly  For example, say  I have the GPS reading every one sec in an Android phone for an hour  3600 samples , can I make a guess of the whole path not fixed i travelled from say just 100 sample  This can save battery power and storage in case possible. Another example could be an image Y[i,j]  where i have i1,j1, i2,j2..ik,jk samples, and using these samples derive the full image. If the path or the image is described by any analytical function say a circle or a predictable checkerboard then it would not be difficult, but for a generic case, when the relations can not be analytically described, it could be interesting.p  pI understand if the signal x is completely random I would not be able be able make any clue  from few samples, but if it is not random  say have some relationship correlations with the other samples, there should be a way to get at least some good idea about the whole signal, even though not completely accurate. Can anyone point any good algorithm to do thisp

Negative 25404 pIm just doing some analysis of a disassembled 32bit program I wrote in C.  Here is a portion of the output from the disassemblerp  precode41153c  02 00   add al, [eax] 41153e  00 00   add [eax], al 411540  44  inc esp 411541  15 41 00 F8 FF  adc eax, 0xfff80041  A 411546  FF  invalid  codepre  pIm just trying to make sense of the ADC instruction.  From what Ive read in both the Intel developers manual, and various articles on x86 ASM the opcode 0x15 is the ADC instruction using EAX as the destination, and it would appear that following the opcode is a four byte immediate that indicates the memory address for use in the add with carry.p  pHowever Im a little unsure as to why the following byte 0xFF is being marked as invalid.p  pIm quite new to assembler, but Im assuming that this is something to do with the carry flag, and might possibly be there to sign extend the value.  p  pIve used two separate disassemblers to look at the code, and whilst one marks it as invalid, the other simply ignores it.p  pIf someone could offer some advice, Id appreciate it.p  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIll add a bit more information to this post, as there are another two ADC operations, and one of them doesnt have the extra invalid bytep  precode411547  FF 04 00    inc [eaxeax] 41154a  00 00   add [eax], al 41154c  61  popa     41154d  15 41 00 EC FF  adc eax, 0xffec0041  A 411552  FF  invalid   411553  FF 04 00    inc [eaxeax] 411556  00 00   add [eax], al 411558  5C  pop esp 411559  15 41 00 74 65  adc eax, 0x65740041  A 41155e  73 74   jnc 0x4115d4  codepre  pThe second ADC thats taking place also has the extra 0xff invalid byte, however the third does not.p  pFrom what I can see, the only difference between all three ADC operations is that the first two start with 0xff and have an extra invalid byte, whilst the third does not.  Im assuming that this is forming some kind of flag to indicate if the extra byte is needed.p

Negative 25404 pI need to find a configuration or plugin for Eclipse that makes Eclipse compile if and only if ant clean all compiles, and it should work with reasonable performance for a huge project, without having to do thousands of configuration settings in Eclipse. I know other IDEs do this out of the box, but I need to start love Eclipse. Currently I have a project that compiles fine with ant clean all, but in order to write unit tests I believe I need to convince Eclipse that the project compiles too. I have tried Refresh and ProjectClean without success. I also have tried a little bit with ProjectPropertiesBuilders and adding a ant builder. Although a promising path I got confused My workspace consist of 80 different projects and when I usually compile this I go to one particular project folder at the command line and do ant clean all and all different subprojects are compiled into a single app. However it would be too bad performance for Eclipse to do ant clean all all the time. I would be most grateful for any ideas or linksp

This blue box obviously has some width to it  since it takes up space. But the CSS has specified a width of 0, which actually should just be a suggestion, whereas the table cell will actually get its width from some child that has pushed it around.p  pSomehow javascript is saying that the offsetWidth of the tablecell is 0.p  pAll other browsers will give the actual offset width of this tablecell as some nonzero value. Including if you test on Chrome v29 or lower.p  pOnly Chrome v30 seems to have this issue.p  pAnyone know what is going on here Or should I just sit around waiting for Chrome developers to fix the bugp  pPerhaps I am relying on the offsetWidth when I should not be relying on thisp  pThis seems like a clear violation of W3C specs  maybe I am wrongp  pAlso  it seems as though Chrome is not wrapping the text at all  but all other browsers will wrap the text because I have specified a width of 0 in CSS it should try to minimize the width wherever possible.p  pPlease note  if you change the width of the testWidth cell, the offset will just change to have that width  i.e. you could say 10px instead of 0, and the output will be 10. So the offsetWidth is just taking whatever width I put in CSS, which is wrong... rightp

Negative 25404 pI know that the Arduino has three timers timer0, timer1, timer2 and one is 16bit and the other is 8 bit but i am not sure how to use them and if possible can i use all three in the same project with each one having different time intervals that should never collide. i assume that i need a library to call them but i dont know which one. All the timer would run functions and not interact with Pins directly and the shortest time interval will be set at 13 of a second and the longest time interval will vary from 2 seconds to 0.5 seconds. If anyone can give me an example of a sketch with three timers i could probably get a feel for what i need to do.p
Negative 25404 pIm working on a program for Intel 8086 and though the whole logic seems to be working pretty well, I have a problem with outputting the final result to the user. Namely, I store it in one of the registers but would like to print it out in decimal form, without interpreting it as ASCII characters or other things. I know its assembly so most probably it wont be as easy as Id like it to be, but still, whats the easiest way to do it since the regular MOV with 02h doesnt workp
Negative 25404 pI have a dashboard web application that currently starts a thread and tails a log file, even time a line is added to the file the tailer picks it up, parses it and then publishes an event around the application, which in turn does things like send it to the client over a web socket or updates a total stored on disk.p  pThis all works fine and so far seems to be handling 500,000 log events a day without batting an eyelid.p  pBut looking at the Spring family maybe there is a better way of doing this in a more standardised fashion that can make it easier to maintain the code and for others to support it.p  pAs Im new to Spring can someone tell me if this sort of thing is best suited to Spring Integration or Spring XD, or should I take it a stage further and use Spring Integration and Rabbit MQp

Negative 25404 pI have a UIScrollView whose bounces property is set to YES. When the contentOffset moves past the top of the screen I show a little animated activity indicator much like the mail program.p  pIt would be nice if at a certain point I could mimic the user lifting the finger  literally cancelling touches in the gestureReconizer and forcing touchesEnded.p  pIn iOS is there a way to interrupt the active touch and cancel it entirely or possibly pass it on to nowhere or to a view that will quietly not respond to it This is an active UITouch. Most if not all of the ways to do this are set before the finger ever touched the screen. They are not effective in this case.p  pI looked for ways to directly cancel UITouches, cancelling User interaction entirely, and even tried simply plonking a view directly in the way of the active scrollview, but to no effect.p  pIs there a way to do this or is it horribly verboten by the Apple godsp

So, yes, it may be convenient for the helpers to use shallow, but its  NOT AT ALL convenient for the rest, you loose all the interest of one collection is nested to one project, so this is reflected in the URL.p  pI dont know if there is another way to do this, its true that shallow allow more flexibility about the helpers, but its false that its rest compliant. So, is there any chance to get the helpers working its pretty awesome to have nested3pathcollection instead of nested1nested2nested3[nested1.nested2.nested3, nested1.nested2, nested1], and keeping the url part and keep having nested1123nested2456nested3789  p  pThanks  p

Negative 25404 pI have a question on how to implement behatmink functional tests. In my web app, I have users that can access some data sheets if they have the required credentials i.e. no access read only  write.p  pI want to be able to test all the possible contexts via behatmink. The question is what is the best practice for such testing   Some dev told me that I have to create a scenario for each type of user I would like to use. Then, I will have to use the user I created in others tests. But I am not very confortable with this idea  I believe that it introduces coupling between my tests. If the test that creates the user fails, then the test that checks the access over my datasheet for that specific user will also fail.p  pSo, I believed that I could use some fixtures  before testing my app, I run a script that will insert me all the profiles I need. I will have some tests dedicated for creating users, and I will use the fixtures to check if a specific user is allowed to access a specific datasheet. The counterpart with this solution is that I will have to maintain the fixtures set.p  pDo you have any suggestion  idea p

Negative 25404 pFirst of all, it should probably be mentioned that Im fairly new to programming, and that Im using Python 3.2.5. Im trying to create a game that connects to and pings a server with regular intervals. At first, I tried to simply bundle this right into the games main loop, with the result that said loop froze for the duration of the ping My connection is slow, and I dont want this to inhibit gameplay as the game doesnt depend on the server at all  It just needs to ping it to keep the session open in order to later register a final score.p  pGetting to the point, I figured Id try using a secondary loop for all serverrelated code, which brought me to multiprocessing. My current idea is to keep an infinite loop running, and feeding it with tasks through a queue. Itll then return info on wether said tasks were successful or not through queue, and the game can run smoothly. I stripped it down to the following for testing, and nothing gets printed. I would obviously like to know why. p  pIm guessing a lot of clever people have better ideas for how to do this.

Negative 25404 pWhen I checkin a file, the TFS CI trigger waits very little and starts the build. The problem is that I may have 1030 files to checkin, and I would like the TFS to wait at least 5 minutes after my last file checked in before it starts a new CI build. In CruiseControl I had a modificationDelaySeconds property where I could set the minimum amount of seconds to wait after the last checkin. How do I do this in TFS 2012p

Negative 25404 pI am running Xcode 5.1.1. I have recently been writing an app in Xcode 4. Now I come to develop it further in Xcode 5 I have the following problem. info Dark type buttons are no longer visible in IOS6.1 on the phone or simulator. They were before. However they are visible in ios7 on both the phone and simulator. Even though they are invisible on IOS6.1 they will still respond to pressing correctly.p  pI have checked that they are not somehow behind other views and I have tried altering nearly every possible parameter in story board. I have tried making sure that the buttons are not hidden by programatically setting hidden to NO. If I create a new button I get the same problem. The problem is for info Light type buttons also. If I make the buttons custom and give them an image there is no problem.p  pI cant find anyone with a similar problem on the web.p  pIt occurred to me that the default image for an info Dark type button for IOS6.1 was somehow missing in my copy of Xcode but could not work out how to check this. However, I wonder if that is clutching at straws.p  pAny suggestions would greatly appreciated Silasp

Negative 25404 pI am constructing a class to handle drawing a figure based on string input. I want to be able to output the figure to both png and svg images. I process the input pattern to create an abstraction of the figure that will be used in constructing both of the output formats.p  pThis abstraction is an array of objects defining shapes, that will be iterated by two separate methods, one that uses their data to construct svg elements using a custom module I wrote for the task, and another that uses the codePILcode library to create shapes to output to png. There is no problem with either of these methods, the code is all working correctly, and my output is as expected.p  pMy question is one of efficiency, since this code will be run on a server, and will be used to return the image data from an API. As it stands the structure of my code is as followsp  precodeclass Pattern   def initself, inputpattern     self.pattern  inputpattern     self.data  self.process   def processself      processes the input, returning an array      of custom shape objects      which will be read by the render methods   def renderSVGself      uses self.data to render an svg   def renderPNGself      uses self.data to render a png codepre  pThe render methods each have strongseparate dependenciesstrong libraries which must be loaded to do the drawing. Only strongonestrong of the rendering methods will be called for any given API response, so I would like to avoid loading the dependencies for the other method each time codePatterncode is instantiated. p  pTwo possible solutions come to mindp  pstrongSolution 1.strong Import the libraries within the render methods.p  pfor examplep  precodeclass Pattern    initialization etc...   def renderPNG     import PIL      use PIL to render png codepre  pIs this discouraged I have always imported modules at the top of the file, and never within it. It seems like this would work, but I am wondering if there are good reasons to avoid doing this, since I rarely see it.p  pstrongSolution 2.strong Make subclasses for the different formats.p  pfor example, remove both render methods from the base class, and in a separate filep  precodefrom theModuleDescribedAbove import Pattern import PIL  class PNGPatternPattern   def initself, inputpattern     Pattern.initself, inputpattern   def renderself      use PIL to render png codepre  pThis will work as well, but what is the cost of subclassing like this The code to process the input within the codePatterncode class is much longer than either of the rendering methods, but not as large as the codePILcode module. It must be imported before it can be used, is that going to slow things down significantly more than if it were used from within the same file as in Solution 1p  pWhich of these methods is likely to be the most efficient Is there a still better method that I didnt think of Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 25404 pI am working on using an Apache websocket module on Windows 7. I have used the code kindly provided by Disconnect on a hrefhttpsgithub.comdisconnectapachewebsocket relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdisconnectapachewebsocketa and successfully compiled it to run on Windows 7, following guidance from a hrefhttpwww.calazan.comhowtocompileandbuildapachemodulesonwindowsusingvisualstudio relnofollowhttpwww.calazan.comhowtocompileandbuildapachemodulesonwindowsusingvisualstudioa. I have an associated plugin called wsswitchplugin that is called from the websocket module in an identical way to that which Disconnects echo plugin example is used.p  pI am running Apache 2.4.7 within a Xampp 1.8.3 installation. I have configured the httpd.conf file according to the advice from Disconnect.p  pThe strange situation I see is that when Apache starts up, it seems to load the websocket module four times and calls the plugins init function each time. During startup, two instances of the plugin are immediately destroyed, but two remain open. From further debug based on the handles to the plugins, only the last plugin that is created seems to be used. When Apache is stopped, both outstanding plugins are destroyed.p  pBelow is a listing from a debug file where the function names from the disconnect websocket module are listed as they are called from Apache. When Apache is started, it shows four groups of function calls corresponding to the four apparent loads of the websocket module. Finally, when Apache is stopped, it shows the two instances of the plugins being destroyed.p  pCan anyone explain why this is happening please I would like to have the understanding and ideally learn if there is a way to make Apache load the module only once.p  precodeWHEN STARTING APACHE ...  modwebsocketregisterhooks modwebsocketcreatedirconfig path NULL modwebsocketcreatedirconfig path wsswitchplugin     modwebsocketcreatedirconfig aprpcalloc OK modwebsocketconfhandler plugin wsswitchplugininit modwebsocketconfhandler plugin handle 0079B2F0 modwebsocketconfhandler response OK modwebsocketcleanupconfig DESTROY plugin   modwebsocketregisterhooks modwebsocketcreatedirconfig path NULL modwebsocketcreatedirconfig path wsswitchplugin     modwebsocketcreatedirconfig aprpcalloc OK modwebsocketconfhandler plugin wsswitchplugininit modwebsocketconfhandler plugin handle 007A30C8 modwebsocketconfhandler response OK   modwebsocketregisterhooks modwebsocketcreatedirconfig path NULL modwebsocketcreatedirconfig path wsswitchplugin     modwebsocketcreatedirconfig aprpcalloc OK modwebsocketconfhandler plugin wsswitchplugininit modwebsocketconfhandler plugin handle 00410278 modwebsocketconfhandler response OK modwebsocketcleanupconfig DESTROY plugin   modwebsocketregisterhooks modwebsocketcreatedirconfig path NULL modwebsocketcreatedirconfig path wsswitchplugin     modwebsocketcreatedirconfig aprpcalloc OK modwebsocketconfhandler plugin wsswitchplugininit modwebsocketconfhandler plugin handle 00418050 modwebsocketconfhandler response OK   WHEN STOPPING APACHE ...  modwebsocketcleanupconfig DESTROY plugin modwebsocketcleanupconfig DESTROY plugin codepre

All interfaces there and included to the core component and included by the implementation libraries.p  p3  In the implementation Libraries, then the core component will have to include the implementation libraries.p  pThe only case where it seems reasonable decoupled is if I put all interfaces in a separate assembly library where Core component includes and any implementations I might need.p  pWhat do you guys think are ProsCons of the best option All I want to achieve is a decoupled architecture.p  pSo when I do p  pConstructor p  precodeCoreComponentIReader Reader, IDataMapper Mapper  new CoreComponentWindowsReader, SQLServerMapper codepre  pand dont have to include strongWindowsReaderstrong or strongSQLServerMapperstrong into the Core Componentp  pCheers.p

Negative 25404 pI am working to develop a cascading drop down layout in JavaScript that is populated by arrays created using PythonFlask.  I have a Python module and an HTML file and need to pass data and responses between the two.  p  pThe first JavaScript drop down menu is already populated with options to choose a name of a type of data.  Once a user selects an option this information needs to be passed to the Python module.  Then I will use Python ftplib to get information from an FTP server based on the name they selected a list of years for the chosen set of data.  Then, the next drop down will be populated with the list of years.  Once a year is chosen, I will again access the FTP server to get a list of days for that year.  I have no problem with accessing the information through FTP.  p  pI cannot figure out how to communicate between the Python and the html page.  For example, how can I execute a Python function that will return a new array only once the first drop down selection has been made  A second option would be to access the FTP information directly in JavaScript, but I could not find a way to do so nearly as simple as Python ftplib.  Any recommendations for how to approach this problem would be helpful.p

Negative 25404 pI am starting to learn OpenGL 3.3, and now I am trying to do an algorithm that draws 10000 points randomly in the screen. The problem is that I dont know exactly where to do the algorithm. Since they are random, I cant declare them on a VBO or can I, so I was thinking in passing a uniform value to the vertex shader with the varying position I would do a loop changing the uniform value. Then I would do the operation 10000 times. I would also pass a random color value to the shader.p  pHere is kind of my thoughp  precodeversion 330 core  uniform vec3 randomposition uniform vec3 randomcolor  out vec3 Color  void main      glPosition  randomposition     Color  randomcolor  codepre  pIn this way I would do the calculations outside the shaders, and just pass them through the uniforms, but I think a better way would be doing this calculations inside the vertex shader.

As it is, the method works correctly, if I remove the codeToListcode however, the results are no longer correct.

Negative 25404 pI am working on a program which exhaustively searches a large number of permutations and runs a test on each one to accumulate stats based on the category each item qualifies for.p  pThe search input is generated on the fly using a method which returns an IEnumerable with a yield return so its not accumulating the entire dataset at once, rather, its generating it as its consumed.p  pThis works just fine for smallish search spaces but when I get into the hundreds of billions of records to check the process of generating the test cases almost immediately exhausts the 16GB of RAM on my machine and just starts thrashing the computer with page faults before any processing can begin.p  pWhat appears to be happening is that the Parallel.ForEach is greedily attempting to enumerate the entire input set before starting to process anything.p  pSo, my question is, how do I limit the rate at which the Parallel.ForEach requests input data from my test case generatorp  pIve tried using the ChunkPartitioner in the a hrefhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comParExtSamples relnofollowSamples for Parallel Programming with the .NET Frameworka with the idea that maybe the ForEach would stop asking for more partitions when it had fully saturated the thread pool with work but that does not appear to be the case.p  pI have tried searching all over the internet for an explanation of how Parallel.ForEach consumes input and ways I can influence this process but I cant find anything other than ways to partition the input set.p  pAm I just approaching this problem wrong  Is there an alternative pattern that would work better for this type of problemp

Negative 25404 pLooking for answers on what exactly REST is, I came across a post on SOA on stack overflowp  pemmagine you are developing a webapplication and you decide to decouple the functionality from the presentation of the application, because it affords greater freedom.

And that REST is a means of doing that.p  pWhat is the functionality, and what is the presentation is this case p  pI understand REST as an architecture for designing server side code that creates URI links as included in the HTML on a browser, and that processes stateless server requests.

The only difference is that I feel that my class example is more easily understood, I know exactly what it does.

Its a little messy.p  pSo, my question to you is, should I go with classes like the above, instead of enums Are there some things I dont know that might add to Enums case  p

Negative 25404 pSo... in the past Ive been told that my questions arent good... I believe mostly because I havent isolated out problematic code well enough. Ill do my best to ask a pointed, concise, and to the point question in this post. Im certainly open to suggestions about how my question could be asked better.  Thanks. p  pIm working on a small project in C that will serve as a prototype for a larger, buggy program that Ive been working on for some time. Im trying to work out the details in a smaller program first. I have two structsp  precodestruct list      char ownerName[20]     int ownerAge     char sex owner codepre  pand p  precodestruct list2      char petName[20]     char owner[20]     char animal[4]     char breed[50]     char color[20] pets codepre  pThe program is supposed to fgets ownerName from user input and compare it to .owner in the pets struct. The ownerName and petName elements should then be copied into an array, and the name of the owner and hisher pets will be printed in a list. While Im aware I dont need the owner struct to accomplish this, Im using it to model the other program Im writing. p  pIm using      p  precodeif strcmppets[i].owner, name  0  codepre  pto compare the struct elements and seem to have this part down. p  pThe variable j counts the number of records that meet this criteria, and the variable l  j  1. I call the array usingp  precodechar petsList[l] codepre  pThe size of the array is dictated by l j  1 because I need j elements for the petNames  1 element for the owner name. p  pIve also created a pointer to the petsList array via the following p  precodechar ptr[l]  amppetsList codepre  pThe owner name is added to the array via the following command p  precodeptr[0]  char mallocsizeofname strcpy  ptr[0], name codepre  pThe petNames are added to the the array petsList using a for loop. Ive initialized i  1 to prevent petsList[0] from being overwritten and am trying to write petNames to the array via the following loop p  precode i  1          for k0 k lt PETS k                      if strcmppets[k].owner, name  0                              ptr[i]  char mallocsizeofpets[k].petName                 if ptr[i]                                      putsnMemory Allocation Error                     exit 1                                  strcpy ptr[i], pets[k].petName                 i                         codepre  pLets say for a given input of name, I get three pets that match. The loop iterates the first two times just fine, but then on the third iteration of the loop, I get a memory allocation error. This happens on the last iteration of the loop consistently. For example, if I have 2 pets associated with the ownerName, the list will run the first iteration fine and fail on the second if I have 4 pets associated with the ownerName, the loop will run fine the first 3 times and fail on the fourth, so it appears that the final iteration of the loop consistently fails. Ive tried changing the code a number of times, but am now at a loss for how I can move forward with this program. Any help is greatly appreciated. p  pThanks. p

Negative 25404 pAs a beginner to rails, Im finding the generation of sitemaps on Heroku to be extremely daunting due to its readonly limitations. However, a sitemap is fundamental to my website as its success is based on SEO.p  pI have tried dynamicsitemaps gem however soon removed it as I realised it had no documentation for heroku use. I then used the sitemapgenerator gem which had coverage of heroku integration using several gems and external platforms such as Amazon S3. The problem however is that as a beginner Im running into issues and finding it hard to get past them. p  pIs there a solution I can use easily generate sitemaps for consistent content such as blog posts on the heroku platform I really want to get up and running and feel this could take a while to configure if I have to use the methods Ive already attempted.p  pThanks p

Beansp  precodepublic class A      private B b      public B getB          return b           public void setBB b          this.b  b        public class B      private A a      public A getA          return a           public void setAA a          this.a  a       codepre  pIve tried thisIve read that with Bean annotation Spring wont invoke method every time bean is referenced, but in this case its actually been invoked all the timep  precodeConfiguration public class Config      Bean     public A a          A a  new A         a.setBb         return a           Bean     public B b          B b  new B         b.setAa         return b       codepre  pAnd this, with Autowired of Configuration class fieldsp  precodeConfiguration public class Config      Autowired     A a     Autowired     B b      Bean     public A a          A a  new A         a.setBb         return a           Bean     public B b          B b  new B         b.setAa         return b       codepre  pAlso Ive tried all above with Lazy annotation. Doesnt help. But works perfectly if I annotate setters of A and B with Autowired. But its not what I want right now. What am I doing wrong and is there any way to resolve Circular dependency in java config without usage of Autowiredp
Negative 25404 pIm having a problem with my button in my HTML5 application. When I press the button a Video player runs and plays the video that is stored locally. My issue now is that when I hold the button and release it, it doesnt fire the video player. Im using an Onclick event on my button. p  pThe thing that I want to achieve is that if I press and hold the button and then release it, it fires the same event as the one I use with the onclick. Im planning to do this by using JavaScript but I have no idea how to fix this problem. Any suggestions would be very appreciated.p  pThanks in advance.  p
Negative 25404 pI am inserting arbitrary binary data into a mysql database MEDIUMBLOB using the below code.  I am writing the same data to a file, from the same program.  I then create a file from the DB contentsp  precodeselect data from table where tag95 order by date, time into outfile dbout codepre  pI then compare the output written directly to the file to the output in dbout.  There are escape 0x5c,  characters before some bytes in the dbout file e.g. before 0x00.  This garbles the output from the database.  My understanding was that by using a MEDIUMBLOB and prepared statements, I could avoid this problem.  Initially I was using mysqlrealescapestring with a regular INSERT, and having the problem.  Nothing seems to be fixing this.p  precodevoid insertdbint16t data, sizet size, sizet nmemb      int16t fwbuf  I have also tried this as char fwbuf     unsigned long i     struct tm info     timet rawtime     char dbuf[12]     char tbuf[12]      iffwinitialized0         fwbuf  mallocCHUNKSZ         fwinitialized  1           iffwindex  nmembsize  1 gt CHUNKSZ  doexit  1         MYSQLSTMT stmt  mysqlstmtinitcon         MYSQLBIND param[1]          timeamprawtime         info  localtimeamprawtime         snprintfdbuf, 16, d02d02d, 1900infogttmyear, 1infogttmmon, infogttmmday         snprintftbuf, 16, 02d02d02d, infogttmhour, infogttmmin, infogttmsec          char tmp  INSERT INTO s date, time, tag, data VALUES s, s, d,          int len  strlentmpstrlendbmontablestrlendbufstrlentbufMAXTAGLEN1         char sql  char  malloclen         int sqllen  snprintfsql, len, tmp, dbmontable, dbuf, tbuf, tag          ifmysqlstmtpreparestmt, sql, strlensql  0             printfUnable to create session mysqlstmtpreparen             exit1                   memsetparam, 0, sizeofparam         param[0].buffertype  MYSQLTYPEMEDIUMBLOB         param[0].buffer  fwbuf         param[0].isunsigned  0         param[0].isnull  0         param[0].length  ampfwindex          ifmysqlstmtbindparamstmt, param  0             printfUnable to create session mysqlstmtbindparamn             exit1                   ifmysqlstmtexecutestmt  0             printfUnabel to execute session mysqlstmtexecuten             exit1                   printfclosingn         mysqlstmtclosestmt          freesql         fwindex  0       else          memcpyvoid  fwbuffwindex, void  data, nmembsize         fwindex  nmembsize       codepre  pSo, why the escape characters in the database  I have tried a couple of combinations of hexunhex in the program and when creating the file from msyql.  That didnt seem to help either.  Isnt inserting arbitrary binary data into a database be a common thing with a welldefined solutionp  pP.S.  Is it ok to have prepared statements that open, insert, and close like this, or are prepared statements generally for looping and inserting a bunch of data before closingp  pPPS  Maybe this is important to the problem When I try to use UNHEX like thisp  precodeselect unhexdata from table where tag95 order by date, time into outfile dbout codepre  pthe output is very short less than a dozen bytes, truncated for some reason.p

Negative 25404 pI have used emOpenCVem with emQt Creator 3.1em, emMacOS 10.9.5em and have set the path in the .pro file and it worked for me. I have now a program which calculates the Disparity map of a stereo camera and then calculates and outputs the point cloud in a .txt file which I can open with Matlab or Meshlab. So far so good, but now I should display an elevation grid map direct from the camera data, so I thought first display the point clouds without an extra program, though PCL is good for displaying the points and then converting it to the elevation grid map or surface polygons.. p  pI tried to install PCL but got a lots of errors and tried different installation methods, so I removed my usrlocal folder and reinstalled OpenCV and PCL with Homebrew. After installing a few packages manually it worked.  So OpenCV works again if I use the .pro file. My target is to compile Ocv and PCL code in one program.. p  pp  pAt first I would like to use PCL and tried this tutorial or an other minimal example a hrefhttppointclouds.orgdocumentationtutorialsqtvisualizer.php relnofollowhttppointclouds.orgdocumentationtutorialsqtvisualizer.phpa but Im really new to this all and dont know much of it.p  pI cant get cmake working, does someone know how to The same was asked here a hrefhttpwww.pclusers.orgQtandPCLandOpenCVtd4036749.html relnofollowhttpwww.pclusers.orgQtandPCLandOpenCVtd4036749.htmla with some cmake progress but I have no real clue what to do there.p  pOr which codeINCLUDEPATHcode and codeLIBScode do I have to add to the .pro file that it works Then I think it would work perfect also with OpenCV..p  pAfter that how can I use Ocv and PCL together Is now only the cmake file used an I have also to add Ocv in cmake or is the pro file also used For the elevation grid map its better to make a new thread I think when I got pcl working.p  pthx very much p
Negative 25404 pI have a report which consists of 3 sections. Its an ordering system. The main report shows the bulk of the data but that bottom row is divided in two. Each section contains a separate sub report. The sub reports can return multiple lines are not related to each other. You could have 10 line son one, and 3 on the other report.p  pMy problem, is that when the report runs it exports to PDF perfectly. But on the web, if both reports dont have the same number of lines, then it bottom aligns themwhy not top align them. I have set the positions etc to be the same, but this is to no avail. i dont want to preset the size of the sub reports as they can grow to any size, so Im at a loss to how I can top align the reports. They are already in the same row, with their top position set the same.p  pAny help be appreciated mark p

Negative 25404 pWe have a spring mvc web application that will serve many users in their actions. Our data source is a mySQL DB.p  pThe web app is located on a cluster of tomcat server.p  pUsers do not have a session while interacting with the web application.p  pThe protocol is a simple REST API between users and the web app.p  pWe would like to ignore users requests if another request handling is still in progress. for examplep  precodeuser1 requests for action1... action1 handling begins in webapp. user1 requests for action1 again before the handling is completed server declines the 2nd request since action1 handling is still in progress.. action1 handling completed. result for action1 is returned to user1s client. now further actions is accepted by the web app codepre  pHow is it possible to achieve this if we used a single node of web app we could manage it simply in memory, but since we use a cluster and no shared memorycache it wont work.p  pAnother alternative we thought about is using a locking in the DB, for example create a constraint for the userID in a dedicated table called userLock and before each handling we simply insert into this table, and finalizing by removing the entry from it, now if an illegal request is made, a constraint exception is thrown and not handledp  pare there any other alternatives to this semaphore behaviorp
Negative 25404 pI want to implement error checking rules for lint styled static analysis of simple codes single function, about 30100 lines in c, cpp, java and python. The main requirement for solving this is being able to generate ASTs.p  pI observed that the Eclipse IDE does a lot of static analysis, AST generation and processing using the plugins CDT, JDT, DLTK. I found that JDT could be used in standalone applications not requiring Eclipse to generate ASTs.

Negative 25404 pIve run into an error with a test WPF application that Im using to learn Prism. The error log is below, but the gist of it is that it cant seem to find Microsoft.Practices.Unity version 3.5.1.0. From my understanding this can mean two things either it cant find any version of Unity, or its finding the wrong version number of Unity.p  pTo rule out the first option at least I believe this rules it out I double checked that the dll is installed in the projects that need it and in the bin folder there is only one copy of Unity within each project and the bin folder. It is installed, but per the properties description it says that the version is 3.5.0.0. Per the Object Browser it says the dll is in a folder titled Unity.3.5.1404.0. Note that the dll was installed using NuGet, and the two groups of packages I installed are called Prism and Prism.UnityExtensions. Its the second one that the Unity dll is in.p  pWhats interesting is that I actually started a new tutorial project to see if itd fix the issue, and copied over some pieces of the projects from the original one. I was able to compile and run it the first time, but then I took out the section of code below from the App.config file just to see what would happen dumb mistake... and started getting the same error. This is even after I added it back to the App.config file. Note that the code below was in the App.config file when I created the project its not something I personally added later.p  pIs there somewhere else I should look for rogue Unity dlls that might be causing issues Is there something I need to add or remove so that the current Unity dll will workp  hr  pCode where error is happening on bootstrapper.Run this is in App.xaml.csp  precodeprotected override void OnStartupStartupEventArgs e              base.OnStartupe          Bootstrapper bootstrapper  new Bootstrapper         bootstrapper.Run      codepre  hr  pCodep  precode  ltstartupgt     ltsupportedRuntime versionv4.0 sku.NETFramework,Versionv4.5 gt   ltstartupgt   ltruntimegt     ltassemblyBinding xmlnsurnschemasmicrosoftcomasm.v1gt       ltdependentAssemblygt         ltassemblyIdentity nameMicrosoft.Practices.ServiceLocation publicKeyToken31bf3856ad364e35 cultureneutral gt         ltbindingRedirect oldVersion0.0.0.01.2.0.0 newVersion1.2.0.0 gt       ltdependentAssemblygt       ltdependentAssemblygt         ltassemblyIdentity nameMicrosoft.Practices.Prism.SharedInterfaces publicKeyToken31bf3856ad364e35 cultureneutral gt         ltbindingRedirect oldVersion0.0.0.01.1.1.0 newVersion1.1.1.0 gt       ltdependentAssemblygt       ltdependentAssemblygt         ltassemblyIdentity nameMicrosoft.Practices.Unity publicKeyToken31bf3856ad364e35 cultureneutral gt         ltbindingRedirect oldVersion0.0.0.03.5.1.0 newVersion3.5.1.0 gt       ltdependentAssemblygt     ltassemblyBindinggt   ltruntimegt codepre  hr  pErrorp  blockquote   pSystem.IO.FileLoadException was unhandled     HResult2146234304     MessageCould not load file or assembly Microsoft.Practices.Unity, Version3.5.1.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken31bf3856ad364e35 or one of its dependencies.

So ,In a normal user mode ngwatch is continuously getting that my models are changing. Will this method produce low performance in my web app If it did,Would you recommend me a way to implement an autosave on angular.p  pEDITp  pin brief   what i want to know is, if used watch for multiples scopes who are continuously changing can affect to the web page performancep
Negative 25404 pI need to fetch some string resources from Amazon S3 in a concurrent multithreaded environment. I would like to implement caching using Amazon ElastiCache. In essence I would like to implement a method like that p  precodeString getSomethingkey      String something  elastiCache.getkey     if something  null          something  s3.getkey         elastiCache.putkey, something          return something  codepre  pThe problem is that in concurrent environment the code like this is a subject to race conditions. If the key expires in elastiCache, multiple threads will try to fetch it from s3 and put it back to elastiCache. The easiest way to avoid it is to put synchronized on the method. This is not optimal, because all calls to getSomething will be interleaving and that will result in a slowdown for the case when the value is in elastiCache. I found CAS methods on MemcachedClient getsasyncGets and asasyncCAS. Using this methods I can make it so that only the thread that didnt find the key in elastiCache will put it back. But is there a way I could avoid accessing s3 from multiple threads, short of using synchronized p

Negative 25404 pIm switching from NoMachine NX to xpra, since NX has dropped support for isolated windows in NX4, and xpra is better supported. Better yet, xpra has better integration between remote and local apps, even bringing the notification area icons to the local systems notification area.p  pThe one thing missing in a hrefhttpxpra.org relnofollowxpraa is an easy way to pop up the remote systems menu gnome3xdgetc.. xpra doesnt support much of what traditional panels lxpanel, adeskbar, fbpanel, etc. need in order to operate properly, since the window list and notification area are forwarded to the local system. So running an autohide panel doesnt necessarily work as hoped.p  pAn alternative would be an icon which sits in the notification area system tray, NOT a panel widgetindicator, which pops up the system menu. Is there a prefab application to do this, popup the gnomemenu or xdg system menu upon click of a tray icon as opposed to an indicatorwidgetp  pMost such popup menus are based on a panelspecific widget, which assumes theres a panel to begin with. A better solution would be an application which doesnt assume presence of a desktop panel, simply adding an icon to the notification area.p

Negative 25404 pI am developing a serializer which should be compliant with an already existent, big and well defined schema. In order to unit test my serialization and attributes which define how things are serialized I want to use unit testing.p  pThe problem is that I want to unit test element by element.p  pFor example This Schema has an element called codeidecode, this element has another elements within it. On my project I have an object which represents this codeidecode element.p  pIn my test method I create an instance of this object and generate a xml on which this codeidecode element is the root. I want to be able to validate this single xml node using the entire codexsdcode.p  pHow would I go about doing thisp  pThe only thing that came to mind and seems too much trouble is to modify the schema on the fly, so it has only the elements that interest me on the given moment. I tested and verified that this would work, but would be bad for maintenance. p  pWhat is the correct way to achieve thisp
Negative 25404 pIm looking for a way to retrieve at runtime the fields of a class in sourceorder, so that I can perform my own initialization processing which is to be based on the order of declaration. I know that Javadoc for codeClass.getDeclaredFieldscode explicitly states that no order is guaranteed.p  pSome answers on SO point to codeJavassistcode but I can find no evidence that codejavassistcode has any such guarantee in the absence of line number information.p  pYet this sourceorder is used by the Java compiler, as this code does not compilep  precodeprivate int a  10  b private int b  5 codepre  pClearly, the value of codebcode isnt known at the moment codeacode is being declared.p  pThis initialization order must also be present in the bytecode since at runtime the initialization must happen in the same order granted, this is only a requirement for these edge cases  Yet this leads me to think that the natural thing would be to store the source order inside the code.classcode file. p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol lipHow does the JVMByte Code go about initializing member fields in declared order, and can this information perhaps be used to reconstruct sourceorder of fieldspli lipIs there any other guaranteed way of achieving the same.

I dont like adding order explicitly e.g. by adding arrays or annotations, as I want to keep the source as readable as possible.p  p edit  An important note may be that the fields I need to traverse will all be annotated, e.g. codeMyComplexTypelen  4code. The parent class will need this metainformation to construct a kind of memory map. Yet I dont want to clutter this annotation with ordering information, as I find this hinders readability and maintainability.p

In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier. We selected the timezone UTC for now, but please set date.timezone to select your timezone. in UsersuserSitesmyphpinfo.php on line 1p  pI have doublechecked codeusrlocaletcphp5.6php.inicode and the timezone I add is codedate.timezone  EuropeAmsterdamcodep  pFollowing to the course I have to edit the additional ini file because it overwrite the loaded configuration file. The only additional configuration file I got is codeusrlocaletcphp5.6conf.dextintl.inicodep  pIn this file there is no codedate.timezonecode at all. What am I doing wrongp

See problematic frame for where to report the bug.  AL lib EE alccleanup 1 device not closed  Process finished with exit code 1 codepre  pIt is obvious that there is an issue with box2d. When the game transitions away from the current screen, the previous screen is codedisposecoded of. When I dispose my codeGameScreencode, I do the following Bear in mind that the context of this extends Stagep  precodeworld.clearForces world.setContactListenernull ArrayltBodygt bodies  new ArrayltBodygtworld.getBodyCount world.getBodiesbodies for Body body bodies     world.destroyBodybody  bodies.clear world.dispose renderer.dispose clear getBatch.dispose super.dispose codepre  pI presume that the error comes when disposing of codeworldcode Which is an instance of codeWorldcode. In the source file for world, under codedisposecode, it has one line codejniDisposecode. This clearly links to the codejniIsActivecode in the error and The problematic frame is in C Box2d is written in C.p  pWhat am I doing wrong Is there a different way to dispose the stage Do I not need to dispose it at all Bearing in mind it is likely that another codeGameStagecode will probably be created in the near futurep

Negative 25404 pI think I know the answer to this, but Im hoping someone has a clever trick to get around the issue.p  pIm using google maps API, so thats why the structure cant change too much.p  pUltimately my goal is to pin one overlay view in place but have other overlay views still be able to be on top of the pinned div. The only way Ive found to pin the div is to use JavaScript to pull it up the dom two levels. I know this sounds confusing so Ill illustrate with some codep  precodelt Standard Google OverlayView gt ... unrelated divs ltdivgt     ltdivgt         ltdivgt             ltdivgt                 ltdiv classoverlayviewgtltdivgt                 ltdiv classoverlayviewgtltdivgt                 ltdiv classoverlayviewgtltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt   lt Pinned Google OverlayView gt ... unrelated divs ltdivgt     ltdivgt         ltdivgt             ltdivgt                 ltdiv classoverlayviewgtltdivgt                 ltdiv classoverlayviewgtltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classoverlayview pinnedgtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pI have to move the pinned overlay up the dom so that the map will quit dragging it around.p  pThe issue is that the pinned overlay view is always above the other overlay views. I want it to be under it. I was successful in getting the pinned one to be under the others by playing with the zindex of the containers of the other overlay views, but that caused the markers to be above the pinned overlay view. Thats not the desired effect.p  pIs there anyway I would be able to achieve Marker on bottom, Pinned next, Standard overlay views on topp

The idea is to open adventure as a child process and then play the game by writing to its codestdincode and placing an event listener on codestdoutcode.p  pWhen the game starts, it prints an initialp  blockquote   pWelcome to Adventure  Would you like instructionsp blockquote  pSo to illustrate my problem, I have a nodejsexpress instance withp  precodevar childProcess  requirechildprocess var spawn  childProcess.spawn var child  spawnadventure  console.logspawned   child.pid  child.stdout.ondata, functiondata    console.logChild data   data  child.onerror, function     console.logFailed to start child.  child.onclose, function code    console.logChild process exited with code   code  child.stdout.onend, function     console.logFinished collecting data chunks.  codepre  pBut when I start the server, the text from the game doesnt reach the event listenerp  precodespawned 24250 codepre  pThats all the output I get. The codechild.stdout.oncode even listener is never called. Why isnt that initial line from the game being picked upp  pIf I append the following line to the above block of javascript, then the program output appears at once. So codeadventurecode runs, and I can now force it to trigger the codechild.stdout.oncode event listener... but this also ends the child process, which defeats the purpose of reading and writing to it.p  precode... child.stdout.onend, function     console.logFinished collecting data chunks.  child.stdin.end codepre  pNow the output isp  precodespawned 28778   Child data Welcome to Adventure  Would you like instructions user closed input stream, quitting...

Negative 25404 pI am using a Doctrine2 type to encrypt database values. The type converts the PHP value internally to and from a database value by encrypting and decrypting it. This works perfectly due to the Doctrine2 types. p  pThe encryption is stored as a base64 encoded string. Every encrypted string is prefixed by a fixed defined prefix. This means the database field contains both encrypted and decrypted values this is required by external requirements, recognized by the prefix.p  hr  pMy wish is the followingp  pAssume I have an entity.
