Positive 7573 pI have a SAS program that has a base year of data and five forecast years.  All the forecast years have the same calculations, but just use the prior years data as the base year for calculations.  I want to avoid copying the data 5 times and just changing the suffix of my variable names.  It would be great to have just one forecast year and have a do loop or an array to change the suffix of the variable names.

I need to be able to make a macro variable out of a particular entry of a dataset so that I can concatenate it with the pathway and then tell SAS that it is a filename.p  pP.S., I am aware that I can create a new dataset entry which has the full pathway to the file. That is all well and good, but it isnt the heart of the problem.p  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 7573 pI am working on the design of a database that will be used to store data that originates from a number of different sources.

Negative 7573 pAlthough I am almost certain the answer to this question will be browser specific, do any of the browsers define behavior for when multiple strongltscriptgtstrong tags are used and have the same src attributep  pFor instance...p  precodeltscript src..jsfoo.jsgtltscriptgt ...  lt what happens here gt ltscript src..jsfoo.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pThe reason I ask this question in the first place, is that in my particular case I am using partial views in an ASP.NET MVC application which make use of JQuery. The JQuery JS files are all included in the master template file via script tags. I would prefer to add script tags to the partial view files so that in case they are used outside the context of the master template, they will automatically include all the necessary JS files, and not rely on another view or template to include them. However, I certainly dont want to cause JS files to have to be transferred to the client multiple times, or any other side effects that could negatively impact the user experience.p  pMy thinking right now is that most, if not all, of the major browsers FF, Safari, IE, Opera will cache a JS file the first time it is used, and then on subsequent script tags the browser will use the cached copy if available and if it hasnt expired. However, caching behavior can usually be altered through browser configuration, so it doesnt seem too safe to rely on any kind of caching behavior.p  pWill I just have to accept the fact that my partial views are going to have be dependent on other templates or views including the appropriate JS filesp

Ive created a UIViewController called MainViewController, which loads in other views as required.

I can then call the method using [parent ViewSwitcher].  This seems a bit clunky, and Im concerned Im creating some horribly recursive structure.  Is there a better wayp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 7573 pI have a project where a xsd document is loaded, and based on that a editor is created for each element. And then xml that implements that schema is loaded into the editor.

Negative 7573 pIm trying to port a program which uses a handrolled interpolator developed by a mathematician colleage over to use the interpolators provided by scipy. Id like to use or wrap the scipy interpolator so that it has as close as possible behavior to the old interpolator.p  pA key difference between the two functions is that in our original interpolator  if the input value is above or below the input range, our original interpolator will extrapolate the result. If you try this with the scipy interpolator it raises a codeValueErrorcode.

Negative 7573 pIm creating a form in a Rails 3 app that has a dropdown field. In the dropdown there is an option for Other, and when you select Other a text box appears, and when saved, the text box value is saved instead of the dropdown menu value. I wrote some javascript that accomplishes the above for any select dropdown with the class hasother. p  pIm having trouble figuring out how to reverse this, i.e. when a user is editing the form with existing contents in it, if the field in the database is something other than what is in the select menu, then to display Other and the textbox with the custom value in it. I would like to do this via javascript if possible, so I can still have one constant function that works on all select boxes with class  hasother. Right now when I view the edit form with data in it, if the value stored in the database is not in the dropdown menu, the first item is selected as it would be if nothing was selected yet.p  pMy question is, is there some way via javascriptjQuery that I could check the attempted value of the dropdown so I could use that to manipulate the actual value Such as, on page load, get the data that the rails object is putting into the form Sorry if this is unclear, Ill edit if more info would be useful.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 7573 pIve come across a very annoying problem in regard to tooltips on Controls within tabpages that get added and removed by the user at runtime.p  pBasically all I have is a tabControl with 9 tabPages and a label within each tabpage with an associated tooltip and a comboBox to make a decision of what to display at a given time. When the comboBox.SelectedIndexChanged event occurs, I do two things remove all tabPages besides [0] from the tabControl and then switch on the selectedIndex. In case 0 I add tabPages[1][4] back to the tabControl and in case 1 i add tabPages[5][8]. Heres where the problem lies, under some condition which isnt clear, the tooltip will fail to display on any label within the tabPages. To make matters more confusing, if you play with it enough, I can get the tooltip to not only not display on either case set, but I can also get it to display on both case sets displaying proper functionality.p  pIve created a spike solution to try and simplify the problem and eliminate any elements from surrounding code from the actual project that may have been causing the problem.

Were tasked with redeveloping a web app that does some employee management and financial bookkeeping of sorts. Im no web technologies expert but I believe in subscribing to the MVC type development methodology. So I have been looking at the tool of choice to get the job done for a while now. The other guys is championing PhP as a tool of choice, however I have reservations because using php will not really allow for the good practice of MVC. I have been looking at other alternatives and have heard Ruby on Rails, Wicket, Django e.t.c. mentioned. My only objection with PhP is that the business code is tied to the view code.p  pThis is an edit. I am currently looking at the ruby on rails site. Does anyone have a comment as to the suitability of this web technologyframework for medium to possible enterprise level web app developmentp

Negative 7573 pIm writing a TCP server on Windows Server 2k8. This servers receives data, parses it and then sinks it on a database. Im doing now some tests but the results surprises me.p  pThe application is written in C and uses, directly, Winsocks and the Windows API. It creates a thread for each client connection. For each client it reads and parses the data, then insert it into the database. p  pClients always connect in simultaneous chunks  ie. every once in a while about 5 I control this parameter clients will connect simultaneously and feed the server with data.p  pIve been timing both the readingandparsing and the databaserelated stages of each thread.p  pThe first stage readingandparsing has a curious behavoir. The amount of time each thread takes is roughly equal to each thread but is also proportional to the number of threads connecting. The server is emnotem CPU starved it has 8 cores and always less than 8 threads are connected to it. p  pFor example, with 3 simultaneous threads 100k rows for each thread will be readandparsed in about 4,5s. But with 5 threads it will take 9,1s on averagep  pA friend of mine suggested this scaling behavoir might be related to the fact Im using blocking sockets. Is this right If not, what might be the reason for this behavoirp  pIf it is, Id be glad if someone can point me out good resources for understanding non blocking sockets on Windows.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pEach client thread reads a line ie., all chars untils a n from the socket, then parses it, then read again, until the parse fails or a terminator character is found.

They cannot be servers because they have dynamic IP addresses and may be behind firewalls. So, a socket link must be established and preserved, which leads us to HTTP push. Only rarely will data actually be pushed to a given client, so we want to minimize the connection overhead too.p  pThe server should handle this by accepting the connection, inserting the remote IP and port into a table, and leaving it idle. We dont want 100,000 threads running, just so many table entries and file descriptors.p  pIs there any way to achieve this using an offtheshelf HTTP server, without writing at the socket layerp
Negative 7573 pI heard that Junit has a fork mode option to fork and run every unittest.testcase instance in a separate process.  Does pyunit have an option for this  More specifically, can I set this option somehow, using pyunit through the test runner preferences in the pydev plugin for eclipsep  pFor the sake of explaining my problem more completely, each test case uses code that can only be run once in the given processi.e. startup and shutdown routines.  This is a requirement, and the underlying problem is that startup cannot be called again within the same process.  How can I run a suite of tests that fork each test case into a separate process  Preferably, without hacking the pyunit code itself.p

Negative 7573 pIm building a website. Users can submit Title which is a string of unicode characters not just English.p  pWhen a user submit a Title, I want to see if its already in the database MySQL. If it is, Id just update the existing record. If its a new Title, Id create a new record for it.p  pI guess the standard way to test for uniqueness is to just create an INDEX on the column Title. But Im concerned about the size of such an index because Title could be quite long.p  pSo Im wondering if theres a way to create a signature of Title and use that to test for uniqueness Is there some hash function that would hash from an unicode string to a unique valuep  pAny pointers will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.p
Negative 7573 pI am trying to write a variable monitoring class that allows me to pass it a pointer ideally void addressing a memory location which would normally be completely outofscope or inaccessible for the class. The class would then periodically display on the screen in text the contents of that memory location  interpreted in a user defined way eg. int . I would only ever read from memory using this pointer and it would serve as a dirty hack to enable a kind of watch window during development for the variables that I am temporarily interested in monitoring during runtime  without introducing a lot of code to bring these variables in scope  accessible to the class. p  pI am using VC 2010 and it seems to flat out refuse to let me even write an out of scope memory location address to the pointer.p  pI guess theres a lot going on under the hood in windows such that this approach may have very limited applicability as memory locations change but I am using native C so am hoping that my addresses are persistent enough to be useful. Also, I can see that it would not like me accessing a memory location that my program is not actually using for security reasons...p  pAny ideas how I can do this I realise that using such pointers gives rise to undefined behaviour so would only ever read from them and display the value.p  pThanks.p

Negative 7573 pI need to implement a variant on the classical producersconsumers with bounded buffers problem.

Each consumer waits for the producer, then consumes, then signals the reader.  In this solution, at least the consumers still execute concurrently, but it doesnt really capture the spirit of the problem, and it doesnt take advantage of a buffer.

Negative 7573 pWhen recently designing a medium to large scale web app, I decided to go with a clientheavy implementation of webforms rather than asp.net MVC for the UI layer. p  pThe reason being that with webforms it is easy to quickly knock up screens and glue together a web app I use Teleriks radcontrols extensively as they have a rich client model. I find that the earlier I get a prototype UI infront of a client, the quicker they can look at it and evolve it into what they really want.p  pWhen I say clientheavy webforms, I mostly bind data clientside and then use web services to handle events from the client  the web services interact with my business layer and deal in JSON. The advantage comes when, say, one UI event requires that many controls be updated  I can then fall back on the asp.net page cycle and fire off a partialpostback having wrapped the various controls in update panels.p  pThe way I see it, I can have my cake and I can eat it I can use lightningfast JSON web services for performance critical areas of my app but I can revert to the postbackpartial postback model for complex UI areas. All in all, less development time and performant where it matters.p  pSo finally, a questionp  pIm not trying to resist MVC just simply asking is it better than what Im doing above and if so, why   p

Negative 7573 pI have written a GUI for operating a card reader  mainly consisting of an ADD button that brings up a codeFileChoosercode dialog and queues the chosen codeFilecode onto a CardHopper, which is displayed visually as a codeJListcode.p  pNow I want for the CPU another codeJFramecode, on another thread to be able to make requests of the card reader e.g. read a card and send it to me.  Before the card reader had a GUI, it was just a model that ran on the same thread as the CPU, so I could just call its codereadCardcode method.  Now that its on a separate thread, it seems like the right way to communicate is with messagepassing.  p  pI was about to implement something using a codePriorityBlockingQueuecode, whereby the CPU would codeputcode a readcard command on the queue and the CardReader would codetakecode and execute the command, until I realized that the CardReader thread would normally be blocked somewhere within its NetBeanssupplied Swing code, waiting for a GUI event and blind to the arrival of anything on my event queue.  Moreover, this back end request would alter the data model  so even if I emcouldem somehow execute some code in the model, would it be kosher to fire notifications to the GUIs codeListDataListenerscode while the GUI is waiting for GUI eventsp  pI hope this isnt too cryptic  Im still trying to get my arms around the mechanics of GUIs and threads.p

I believe this is a security enhancement in Windows.p  pLooking at the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa38938828vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowCreate method of the Win32Process MSDN documentationa reveals what I suspected  For security reasons the Win32Process.Create method cannot be used to start an interactive process remotely.p  pIt looks like the best I can do is a hrefhttpsmail.tietronix.comowaredir.aspxCc7e3c62d373747b78f5f0858aff2445campURLhttp3a2f2fmotevich.blogspot.com2f20072f112fexecuteprogramonremotecomputer.html relnofollowremotely access Task Scheduler to kick off the remote applicationa after some time interval. Im sure this would bring a horrible user experience to my app who wants to click a tab and wait 30 seconds so I am avoiding that approach.p  pCan someone suggest an approach that will work, or help disprove the possibility of doing thisp  pbEDITb psexecs own a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenussysinternalsbb897553 relnofollowdocumentationa bears out my contention that its not possible.

Negative 7573 pIm getting a date value out of a DB2 database using ADODB objects.  This date is sometimes set to 110001.  This is an invalid datetime in SQL Server.  I need to check for this value and set it to a valid SQL Server date 111900 for example.  The object coming from the ADODB looks to be a codetime.structtimecode.  Whats the best way get code110001code as a codetime.structtimecode object and check it for equality to the same value coming from the DB2 database  p  h2EDITh2  pSo I figured out a bit more of whats going on.  Id already tried what d0nut suggested, but the comparison still failed.  When printing what codetime.strptime110001, dmYcode returns, you get code112001code, not code110001code.  When I try to call codetime.asctimetimeFromDb2code even with valid date values from the DB, I get this exception message codeargument must be 9item sequence, not timecode.  My guess is that the codetimecode object Im getting from the DB is invalid, but because the script in question does nothing with it besides pass it on to another ADODB Recordset object connected to SQL Server, everything is working.  Does anyone have any suggestions on where to go from here  The code that retrieves the date from DB2 and stores it in the SQL Server DB is pasted below.

Negative 7573 pSo the standard multiple choice knapsack problem allows 1 item to be chosen from each class to create an optimal knapsack. However, how would I go about modifying this algorithm to allow 0 or 1 items to be chosen i.e. an item doesnt need to be chosen from each class for the optimal solution, but at most 1 item can be chosen from a class. Is it just the same algorithm allowing no item to be chosen from a classp  pthanksp

Negative 7573 pI have a winform application on which I place a label. I change the text of the label dynamically from a background thread.

As it turns out, the width calculated by the TextRenderer, width  270, is correct and the one calculated by MeasureString, width  260, is incorrect because it truncates the display of the input string to Reading data from input data file ... input. I have also tried measuring the string width using MeasureCharacterRanges and this approach yields a result similar to that produced by the MeasureString approach. The size calculated by TextRenderer seems to display the text correctly.p  pYes, I understand that if this is the case I should simply use the TextRenderer, but can someone please explain to me the source of such a huge discrepancy in the string width calculated by the various methods Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.p

Negative 7573 pI am new to PhoneGap development. My PhoneGap application has a login page and I need to implement a Remember Me option into this login page. If the user has checked the Remember Me checkbox after entering username amp password, the application should remember the user entered username amp password and auto fill the information the next time the user launch the application i.e. username amp password should be persisted even when the application is closed, phone is restarted etc.p  pWhat is the best approach to implement this in a PhoneGap application.. p  pI know I can write the username and password to a file and read it back when app is launched. But I have a feeling that this is not the best way to do this due to various reasons including security.p  pThanks in advance. p
Negative 7573 pI make a UI with PyQt4. It has a treeView and I want to deal with it. The treeView is made up with modelbase. I create a data in .py file and import it. So, I can see the data tree in my treeView. But I cant drag and drop it, so cant change the order. I referred some articles so add it in my script, but they couldnt work. I plant some print, so I chased my problem. I found that when drag a item, it transferred to MIME data. But when it is dropped, I cant find any outputs. It seems that the script doesnt call dropMimeData method.

Negative 7573 pI originally asked this question on a hrefhttpgamedev.stackexchange.comquestions21994repeatedtexturesareseverelydistortedwhenrotatingcameragamedeva, but none of the answers helped to solve problem, and I still have no clue what is the real cause. I didnt see anything about reposting questions across SE in FAQs, so I can only hope this is okay. Moreover, in the retrospect the question is probably more related to graphics programming in general than just game development. p  pstrongEdit 1 beginsstrongp  pThe behaviour of the original post applies only to Windows XP and Windows 7, browsers Firefox and Chrome. On Ubuntu, there is no such distortion, but instead the textures shake while the camera is being rotated. When the rotation is halted, the shaking stops, but the textures may not be in the completely correct position.p  pstrongEdit 1 endsstrongp  pstrongEdit 3 beginsstrongp  pThe program has been tested on 4 different computers, and havent worked as intended on any of them.p  pstrongEdit 3 endsstrongp  pI have a large voxel in WebGL which I want to cover with tiled texture each tile has the side length of 1 in the vertex space. In this test scenario the camera is pointing to the negative z direction and the sides of the voxel are in the xy, xz, yz planes.p  pSmaller voxels i.e. fewer repeats work quite well, but at around 2000 x and y repeats per face ie voxel size 200020002000 the textures start to look really ugly. When the camera points perpendicularly to the face the textures look correct regardless of the sizeamount of repeats, but for voxels of the size mentioned above any rotation of even a couple of degrees causes a visible problem. Increasing the voxel size increases the distortion. The inverse is also true with small voxels the textures look correct regardless of camera rotation. It seems to me that there is no hard threshold value for the size but that the effect starts to increase gradually from zero when the voxel is increased in size from the approx 2000 per side.p  pSee a hrefhttpimgur.comaspQIv relnofollowhttpimgur.comaspQIva for a visualization. The first image is how it should look like, but when the camera is rotated, the lines start to become distorted as in the second image. The effect gets worse by increasing the voxel size and by rotating the camera more. a hrefhttpimgur.comawRndy relnofollowhttpimgur.comawRndya contains two additional images with more severe effect.p  pThe textures one X per texture are originally 512512 px. The screenshots have not been scaled in any way.p  pMy first guess was float inaccuracies, but thats quite hard to believe since the object has only the dimensions of the order of 1000.p  pMy second guess was some kind of weird intfloat rounding error, but since everything is always handled in floats, I dont see how this could happen.p  pThe third possibility I could think of is that this is just impossible and that textures should not be repeated that many times. However, this seems quite unlikely IMO. My guess and hope is that there is some kind of quite elementary problem.p  pAny suggestions about what can cause or commonly does cause this kind of thing are well appreciated, because I seem to be having a very hard time trying to narrow down the source of this problem on my own.p  pIm usingp  precodegl.texParameterigl.TEXTURE2D, gl.TEXTUREMAGFILTER, gl.LINEAR gl.texParameterigl.TEXTURE2D, gl.TEXTUREMINFILTER, gl.LINEARMIPMAPNEAREST gl.texParameterigl.TEXTURE2D, gl.TEXTUREWRAPS, gl.REPEAT gl.texParameterigl.TEXTURE2D, gl.TEXTUREWRAPT, gl.REPEAT gl.generateMipmapgl.TEXTURE2D codepre  pand in the shaderp  precodeifdef GLES precision highp float endif codepre  pI also performed some very elementary calculations For 32bit floats the maximum significand is around 8.4 million. For voxel side length 2000 which I noticed was the level where the effect became visible, one could naively expect approximately 0.00025 of a float rounding error in the coordinates. Assuming each repeat takes around 100 pixels in screen, the error should be significantly less than 1 pixel, which is not the case. Unless my calculation above was done incorrectly, I therefore would nominate that Float32 is not to blame and that the reason must be somewhere else.p  pThe line texture is used only for visualizing the problem. The problem persists also with other more natural kinds of textures.p  pstrongEdit 2 beginsstrong p  pEnabling or disabling antialiasing makes no visible difference p  pstrongEdit 2 endsstrongp

Negative 7573 pI am building an app for a website that will filter through the shops carrying some productsbrands and show the results in a List component. I got all the way up to loading the data, putting brandscountriescities in comboboxes so a user can filter in which country and city he wants to look and for which brand. No problem till now. My problem is that while the dataprovider works as it should when hardcoding some values to the labels that i use for the item renderer of each entry, i cannot get the real data from the data provider.. you will see in the code below, that in the VGroup component which i use for each shop in the list there are 4 labels, where 3 of them are hard coded, just to see it works. One of the labels though is trying to get the real data from the xml file and thats where i stop. In all the tutorials i ve seen and documentation too everybody just hits data.XYZ where XYZ is the name of the attribute or node to get. Doing the same in my case just returns an error of 1120 Access of undefined property data.. What am i doing wrong Its been a couple of hours i am iterating over hundreds of examples for flex, both new and old versions and i cant find out what to do. Its really nerve breaking to stick to this last small thing when all the rest are in Have a look at the code and let me know if i did something the wrong way or i missed something posting the code below. There is also an xml file but its loaded correctly and the different xmlLists DO have the correct nodes stored, so i do not think it needs to be posted, unless you think otherwise. The xml nodes for each shop are title, tel,mail,city and i am stuck trying to get the title. The function that matters the most is the filterShops one and then of course the whole list and itemrenderer block.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltsApplication

Negative 7573 pIs there a way to save a static password in a way that its really hard to find in the compiled appp  pTheres two different apps I need that for. One is a lightweight FTP client for Windows that only connects to one hardcoded server. The other is an Objective C game that lets users create level packs and use passwords to save them. They can be played without password, but not opened in the level editor. Im encrypting the passwords with AES, but I have to somehow save the password for decryption.p  pThe only idea Ive found so far is saving the password not as one string, but as multiple strings. This could work really well for the game because I could just connect strings that are already there. Or I could save it as a long string and use a secret algorithm to get the password out of that string  although that begs the question can C apps on Windows or Cocoa apps on OS X simply be decompiled to find that algorithmp  pAre there more secure ways to do thatp

Negative 7573 pAs the title advances, we would like to get some advice on the fastest algorithm available for pattern matching with the following constrainsp  pLong dictionary 256p  pShort but not fixed length rules from 1 to 3 or 4 bytes depth at mostp  pSmall 150 number of rules if 3 bytes or moderate 1K if 4p  pBetter performance than current ACDFA used in Snort or than ACDFASplit again used by Snortp  pSoftware based recent COTS systems like E3 of E5 Ideally would like to employ some SIMD  SSE stuff due to the fact that currently they are 128 bit wide and in near future they will be 256 in opposition to CPUs 64p  pWe started this project by prefiltering Snort AC with algorithm shown on Sigmatch paper but sadly the results have not been that impressive 12 improvement when compiling with GCC but none with ICCp  pAfterwards we tried to exploit new pattern matching capabilities present in SSE 4.2 through IPP libraries but no performance gain at all guess doing it directly in machine code would be better but for sure more complexp  pSo back to the original idea. Right now we are working along the lines of Head Body Segmentation AC but are aware unless we replace the proposed ACDFA for the head side will be very hard to get improved performance, but at least would be able to support much more rules without a significant performance dropp  pWe are aware using bit parallelism ideas use a lot of memory for long patterns but precisely the problem scope has been reduce to 3 or 4 bytes long at most thus making them a feasible alternativep  pWe have found Nedtries in particular but would like to know what do you guys think or if there are better alternativesp  pIdeally the source code would be in C and under an open source license.p  hr  pIMHO, our idea was to search for something that moved 1 byte at a time to cope with different sizes but do so very efficiently by taking advantage of most parallelism possible by using SIMD  SSE and also trying to be the less branchy as possiblep  pI dont know if doing this in a bit wise manner or byte wisep  hr  pBack to a proper keyboard Dp  pIn essence, most algorithms are not correctly exploiting current hardware capabilities nor limitations. They are very cache inneficient, very branchy not to say they dont exploit capabilities now present in COTS CPUs that allow you to have certain level of paralelism SIMD, SSE, ...p  pThis is preciselly what we are seeking for, an algorithm or an implementation of an already existing algorithm that properly considers all that, with the advantag of not trying to cover all rule lengths, just short onesp  pFor example, I have seen some papers on NFAs claming that this days their performance could be on pair to DFAs with much less memory requirements due to proper cache efficiency, enhanced paralelism, etcp

Negative 7573 pA stored notification channel URI may go stale while my app is inactive  i.e., stopped, tombstoned or dormant. What is the best practice for updating the channel URI with my web service after a period of inactivity p  pVarious articles on the web mention retrieving the URI in order to send it to the web service. But as far as I can tell, the only way for my app to learn the channel URI is via the codeChannelUriUpdatedcode event on codeHttpNotificationChannelcode, and raising that event is not under my control. MPNS may have changed the URI while my app was inactive. If the app could not respond to codeChannelUriUpdatedcode, the URI would then be stale in both my app and my web service.p  pPerhaps a channel returned by codeHttpNotificationChannel.Findcode is guaranteed to always have an uptodate channel URIp

Negative 7573 pI am developing an iPhone app with skiing destinations being listed in an UITableView. The table view can contain up to 2000 cells. Every cell has a small weather icon of 25x25px Retina 50x50. I am already using weather icons on the detail view of every destination. These icons are twice the size 50x50px on the 3GS and 100x100px with Retina display.p  pAs rendering pngs in a UITableView is pretty memory consuming I am not sure if I should use the larger images also for the table view or if I should design images half the size for the table view only. Of course this would increase the download size of the app by about 300 KB.p  pIt would be nice if anybody could give me an advice if it is best to recycle larger images in the app or if it is best to design images for every resolution needed.p  pThanks in advance Martinp

Negative 7573 pSo the addressable memory space in a 32bit program is 4 gigabytes. Respectively, in a 64bit application, there are 18 exabytes of addressable space.p  pThe kernel32.dll API has a variety of methods regarding the programs heap andor memory.p  pSo my current understanding is that for example if you call HeapAlloc and pass it the amount of memory you need to allocate, it will return a pointer to the address of that allocated memory space... Please correct me if Im wrong here though.p  pNow the advantage of using the win32api functions for this is obviously that Windows knows best where it put other components like loaded DLLs. Thats why Im asking...p  pIs there a fixed position in memory for DLL files. I think I read somewhere that for 32bit it commonly is the upper half of the memory space 0x80000000 and up, but even if thats true, what would the position be for 64bit applicationsp  pAlso, is it not possible to simply use pointers to some memory freely without having Windows allocate it first What would the sideeffects bep  pIm seminew to this subject, so any help or hints are appreciated p

Negative 7573 pI have a toolbar in my UITextfields inputAccessoryView. If the next button is hit it makes the next textfield in an orderedSet of all my textfields become the first responder. THAT works perfectly.p  pBUT I cant get the previous textfield to becomeFirstResponder.p  pIve checked in the console and the textfield does call textFieldShouldBeginEditing and I am returning YES but it never calls textFieldDidBeginEditing and the textfield that should resignFirstResponder never calls textFieldShouldEndEditing.p  pSo the textfield is getting the message to becomeFirstResponder but doesnt.p  precode IBActionkeyboardBarButtonDidTouchUIBarButtonItem sender      if senderself.previousBarButtonampampself.activeTextFieldArrayIndex.intValuegt0              [UITextField [self.textfields objectAtIndexself.activeTextFieldArrayIndex.intValue1] becomeFirstResponder]          if senderself.nextBarButtonampampself.activeTextFieldArrayIndex.intValueltself.textfields.count1              [UITextField [self.textfields objectAtIndexself.activeTextFieldArrayIndex.intValue1] becomeFirstResponder]          if senderself.doneBarButton              [self.activeTextField resignFirstResponder]       codepre  pThe weirdest thing is that if I force the textfield to resignFirstResponder by some action that just does that, the previous textfield suddenly becomesFirstResponder.

Negative 7573 pA htmlsafe method on user generated comment content really is not a good solution, obviously. However, this was, so far, the only solution I could come up with to implement the following feature I wanted to enable users to quote another comment simply by typing the iteration id of the other comment into the comment form like this 14 to quote comment 14 of that article. Then this 14 gets replaced with i[quotedcomment.content]i in the content output.p  pThis is my code for it in the comment modelp  precodedef contentwithquotes   if content.match[09]s     commentcontent  content     commentcontent.scan[09]s do       if quotedcomment  Comment.wherearticleid self.articleid.whereiterationid 2.first         if quotedcomment.createdat lt self.createdat           return commentcontent.sub[09]s, ltigtquotedcomment.contentltigt          end       end     end   else     return content   end end codepre  pThen in my comment view, I apply it with comment.contentwithquotes.htmlsafe and everything works fine.p  pSo, this is what I want, and it works, but of course this htmlsafe method is a bad idea for user submitted content, since it might not be html safe.br Any suggestions on how to approach my feature without doing the htmlsafe methodp
Negative 7573 pI am currently working writing some services for consumption with mobile devices iphone apps, etc. So what is very important to me is the pay load being returned from my http services to the devices, I need it as small as possible.

Negative 7573 pRecently received a request to add communication to a device connected via serialport on the clients machine through my webpage.p  pId done some googling and found that node.js with nodeserialport seems to be the javascript way of doing it. However, in my case, the device is actually connected to the clients machine, and not the server.p  pMy question would be how do i implement node.js in this sense Since the code is run at the client browser, is it possible for me to embed node.js on my webpagep  pOr is there any other alternative for doing this Applet and ActiveX are out of the picture though.p  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATESstrong Had managed to convince the client to have applet loaded from the web, so well be going through the applet route.

Negative 7573 pokay so Im a beginner a started this journey a day ago an slowly teaching myself javascript and i wrote a code for a simple price quoter...but now Im trying to build on it.  I know the code is formatted really bad I have no idea where spaces are supposed to go and those brackets S but what i came up with works...does the spacing and stuff matter to the program or it is for aesthetic reasons and for easy debugging etc...p  pSo my price quote...it has some equations for the total price, time, footage and DVDS...and they are all input fields, and now I want to add check boxes to the equation..if they are checked a value will be added to the total...I have them in the calculator but there is no script attached to them...ONLY THREE check boxes have a set value ...2 check boxes will have a value multiplied by the number of dvds before being added to the total...and the last check box will be another text input similar to what i have already..p  pive tried multiple things, like another function but itwas probably done wrong anyways lol, i tried another calculate function, addition function, updatecost function, some chkbox function i forgot the name...but I wasnt sure how to get the value calculated in that checkboxs function, into the equation of the calculate function.  i tried the parsefloat thing and it only semi worked if i had the value checked....p  panother thing i tried was putting an input hidden value of 0 before the value of the input checkbox, both with the same name...some research told me that if the checkbox is not checked, it will default to the hidden value i set with the same name which is 0...it didnt work...or i may have no inputed it right in the equation....please direct me in the right direction  Im about to pull my hair outp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netyetanothercoderuFD3y relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netyetanothercoderuFD3yap  precodelthtmlgt  ltheadgt     ltstyle typetextcssgt         .tableheader

Negative 7573 pI am looking into options for command line video processing tools for Linux, but I am having a hard time find any. FFmpeg doesnt support hardware acceleration as far as I can tell and I dont see many alternatives.p  pThe machines that will be running the software are running CentOS and each has a NVIDIA Tesla card available. While the CentOS can be swapped with something else not Windows, it would be great to have something that supports CUDA or OpenCL.p  pI dont have any strict requirements for what actually needs to be processed, but I just want to see what options are available for this hardware.p

Negative 7573 pIm trying to incorporate the iAdSuite tab bar view implementation in my app and Im seeing the same problem in the suite and my app. When the ad appears, my contents view is getting properly resized and the ad appears correctly. When the ad then disappears, it leaves behind white space where it was located. However, Ive confirmed that my content view does get resized back to its original height and it gets drawn down to its original bounds. You just cant see the part where the ad was. Ive made sure every view gets a layoutIfNeeded and just about everything else I can think of to no avail. Any thoughtsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkZFwq.png altenter image description herep  pEdit Ive figured out what the problem is. Apples example apparently adds bannerView to self.view every time showBannerView is called but never removes the view. That still doesnt make complete sense since the banner view is being moved offscreen, but removing it does solve the white space problem.

So then, I would not have any data within my true part of if in listFromCache object.p  pstrongTo overcome, this subtle RACE conditionstrong in my original code, I have to double check listFromCache in the true part as in code below, and then repopulate Cache with latest data.p  pAlso, as Chris said, if someone else removes the items from Cache by calling the method Cache.Remove, strongthen listFromCache would not be affectedstrong, since the Garbage Collector will not remove the actual List object from HEAP memory because a variable called  listFromCache is still having a reference to it  I have explained this in more detail in a comment under Chriss answer post.p  precodeListltDocumentgt listFromCache  Cache[dataCacheName] as ListltDocumentgt     if listFromCache  null            OVERCOME A SUBTLE RACE CONDITION BY IF BELOW       if listFromCache  null  listFromCache.Count  0                  ListltDocumentgt list  ABC.DataLayer.GetDocuments           Cache.InsertdataCacheName, list, null, DateTime.Now.AddMinutes5,                        System.Web.Caching.Cache.NoSlidingExpiration                NOW I AM SURE MY listFromCache contains true data        do something with listFromCache.

Negative 7573 pi fought a long time with that problem without finding a solution anywhere. I have a ListView that contains some RatingBars. Everytime i wanted to scroll and hit accidentially a ratingbar a rating was performed instead of a scroll. Now I found a simple solution I wrote my own RatingBarp  precodepublic class ScrollableRatingBar extends RatingBar       public ScrollableRatingBarContext context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle          supercontext, attrs, defStyle           public ScrollableRatingBarContext context, AttributeSet attrs          supercontext, attrs           public ScrollableRatingBarContext context          supercontext           Override     public boolean dispatchTouchEventMotionEvent ev          final int action  ev.getAction         switch action amp MotionEvent.ACTIONMASK          case MotionEvent.ACTIONDOWN              return true                   case MotionEvent.ACTIONMOVE              return true                           return super.dispatchTouchEventev         codepre  pWhat happens if you click at a RatingBar there are 3 different MotionEventsbr ActionDOWN Put your finger downbr ActionMOVE Move your fingerbr ActionUP Put your finger upbrp  pYou dont want to set the rating at the action down or move. So just return true to signal it has happend. If up comes, the programm differes itself if it is a scroll or a rating, depending what you did.p  pThats all I hope someone helps that.p  pEDIT I realize that it is a problem of Android 2.3.7 and lower.p

Negative 7573 pIve used successfully used ZBar in other projects, but am having problems implementing it into my latest project.  It is set up as a tabbed view app, where the first tab is the scanner and the second outputs the results.

Negative 7573 pI am new, so I appreciate your help and patience in advance. I have written a program in C like thisp  precodemain.c arpsend.h  header winclude guard for arpsend.c functions arpsend.c  includes ltnetif.hgt, ltpthread.hgt, etc. arprec.h   header winclude guard for arprec.c functions arprec.c   includes ltnetif.hgt, ltpthread.hgt, etc. codepre  pThe arpsend and arprec files use many of the same kernel library functions and definitions. I have noticed that my program size shot up when I wrote the arprec.c code. It bloated much more than what my code should have. This leads me to conclude that both the arpsend.c and the arprec.c linked the linux library code necessary for their own needs in their respective .c files. The linking is redundant for the project, but necessary for each .c file.p  pMy questions are the following p  ol lipif every .c file I add to a project will bloat like this because of kernel and standard library redundancies, wouldnt every program become needlessly bloated The bloat in my example is probably insignificant 12k, but I can only imagine the kind of bloat that would happen if I needed to use some graphics library across several different .c files. pli lipIs there a way to avoid this pli lipIs the recommended solution to simply keep all functions using the same kernel code in one file pli lipIf 3 is correct, doesnt that defeat the point of trying to keep clean code Its C, so its not really OOP, but I would like to spread my code out so that I can easily see the makeup of a project.pli ol  pI apologize if this is redundant. I sifted through the forums here for a couple hours. I couldnt find my exact question. Thanks again for your helpp

Negative 7573 pI have been coding for about a month and I have found ways to adapt around ever problem but one. The problem as you can probably see by the title is how to make a way to make game saves. I am currently creating a very simple game that has about 5 classes of my code and maybe 2 of Java Swing GUI. p  pI know how I would like to go about the saving process but I have no idea how to do it in my code. How I would like to go about doing this is by making the code print a Number or Integer to a file to represent a Level. For example if you completed level 1 the number in the file would be 1. I have tried some templates for this but none of them work. p  pI understand how to write to a file but my problem is reading it from a jar or even creating a file then reading it from a place on the computer. I need to know how to find a file URL for different computers because some use Docs and Settings and other Users. Please could someone help.p

Hence for any user the sites must not appear related.p blockquoteli lipDo you want to duplicate users info into each applicationsp  blockquote   pAs per my understanding of the question a combination of username and email address considering this combination makes any user account unique can again be stored against another application even with different profile information.p blockquoteli ol  pActually Im used to the classic membership approach used in ASP.net 2.0 and Im missing the application Id column for separation. p

Negative 7573 pIm trying to determine the best way to determine my Ad Unit and Placement definitions.  I have a website that has groups, info pages and aggregation pages.

All this info for Nutrition is aggregated on the Nutrition page.p  pUsers may also create their own groups.p  pMy requirements arep  ul lipSome groups, infopages and aggregation pages are sponsored by a particular sponsor.

Negative 7573 pI recently tried to implement a cascading dropdown into my application with this tutorial on petermac.com a hrefhttpwww.petermac.comrails3jqueryandmultiselectdependencies relnofollowhttpwww.petermac.comrails3jqueryandmultiselectdependenciesap  pThe tutorial basically talks about doing a cascading dropdown, where every dropdown box is an a separate partial and gets loaded with an jQuery onChange event when the parent select is changed.p  pNow I got this to work without a problem. But actually my select boxes have quite complicate relationships between them.p  pSo, the form I belongs to a Model called AuditFunction and as the name says is for auditing. Every audit has a source and a target, which can be compared via several commands. The source as well as the target are selected via 3 select boxes. The first box selects the type of database the field is in. The second box selects the table and then the third box selects the field. As the field box can contain thousands of options I tried to implement the cascading dropdown to make it easier for the user to select the field.p  pTo give you an overview, this is what my actions look likep  precode new.html.erb  lt simpleformfor auditfunction do f gt   lt f.input database1, as gt select, collection gt databases, includeblank gt true gt   lt render partial gt databases1  gt   lt render partial gt fields1  gt   lt f.input database2, as gt select, collection gt databases, includeblank gt true gt   lt render partial gt databases2  gt   lt render partial gt fields2  gt lt end gt codepre  pThe javascript for this looks like thisp  precode jQuery  ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8gt jQueryfunction     when the country field changes   auditfunctiondatabase1.changefunction      var database1  selectauditfunctiondatabase1 selected.val     ifdatabase1   database10     jQuery.getauditfunctionsupdatedatabase1idselect  database1, functiondata         database1id.htmldata          return false      ltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8gt jQueryfunction     when the country field changes   auditfunctiondatabase2.changefunction      var database2  selectauditfunctiondatabase2 selected.val     ifdatabase2   database20     jQuery.getauditfunctionsupdatedatabase2idselect  database2, functiondata         database2id.htmldata          return false      codepre  pp  pNow Im only going to show you the partials for database1id and field1id, but they look the same as database and field 2.p  precode databases1.html.erb  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt   jQueryfunction    auditfunctiondatabase1id.changefunction    var database1id  selectauditfunctiondatabase1id selected.val   ifdatabase1id   database1id0   jQuery.getauditfunctionsupdatefield1idselect  lt params[id] gt  database1id, functiondata     field1id.htmldata      return false       ltscriptgt  lt simpleformfor auditfunction do f gt   lt if params[id] gt lt if params[id]  imp gt   lt f.input database1id, collection AdOriTbl.all.orderorifilename asc.collect a [a.orifilename,a.id] gt   lt elsif params[id]  ori gt     lt f.input database1id, collection AdOriTbl.all.orderotbfilename asc.collect a [a.otbfilename,a.id] gt   lt elsif params[id]  mod gt     lt f.input database1id, collection AdQryMod.all.orderqrymodtext asc.collect a [a.qrymodtext,a.id] gt   lt end gt lt end gt   lt end gt codepre  pAnd now the file containing the target field.p  precode fields1.html.erb  lt simpleformfor auditfunction do f gt   lt if params[id] gt     lt if params[id].gsub1d1,z,    mod  gt       lt f.input field1id, collection AdQryFld.whereadqrymodid params[id].gsubAw1,1, .toi.orderorderid asc.collect f [f.qryfieldtext,f.id] gt     lt else gt       lt f.input field1id, collection AdOriFld.whereadoritblid params[id].gsubAw1,1, .toi.orderid asc.collect f [f.otbcolhdg,f.id] gt     lt end gt   lt end gt lt end gt codepre  pThe controller then contains all the actions triggered in the javascriptsp  precode auditfunctionconroller.rb  def new   authorize new, auditfunctions   auditfunction  AuditFunction.new    functions  [[I18n.ttext sum,sum],[I18n.ttext quantity,quantity],[I18n.ttext largestvalue,largestvalue],[I18n.ttext smallestvalue,smallestvalue]]   databases  [[I18n.ttext originaldatabase,imp],[I18n.ttext archivedatabase,ori],[I18n.ttext querydatabase,mod]] end  def updatedatabase1idselect   if params[id]  mod     type  mod   elsif params[id]  ori     type  ori   elsif params[id]  imp     type  imp   end   render partial databases1, id type end  def updatefield1idselect   type  params[id]   render partial fields1, id type end codepre  pNow, as messy as all of this looks, the good thing is that it gets the job done.

But when I try to edit an object only the field with the database type database1 and database2 are filled. The select boxes for the IDs of the databases are not rendered, while the boxes for the fields are. But all four ID fields are empty.p  pNow I already tried to fill the boxes by hand with a jQuery that basically looks similar to the ones I already have, but instead of getting triggered onChange, I trigger it when my auditfunction has a databaseid and render the select box and fill it with the value according value of databaseid. This works as well.p  pThe problem is that I cant do this with the fieldid, because in the partial of database1id where the jQuery for the fields get triggered, I dont have the auditfunction object at hand and also it seems to interfere with the other javascripts.p  pBesides that Id also like to think that there is a better way to do this, then my way. But I already tried other tutorials and ways and they either dont work when you dont have your straightforward CountryStateCity relationships or they dont work when editing.p  pSo, any help would be really appreciated. Thanksp

Should I use a separate point for adding from the one I use for checking if the set already contains it  It seems this would allow the JVM to allocate the checkingpoint on stack.  Thus in the common case, this will require no heap allocation.p  pEx.  Im considering changingp  precodeHashSetltPointgt set  public void addPointint x, int y      ifset.addnew Pointx,y          Do some stuff       codepre  ptop  precodeHashSetltPointgt set public void addPointint x, int y     ifset.containsnew Pointx,y          set.addnew Pointx,y         Do some stuff       codepre  pIs there a profiler which will tell me whether objects are allocated on heap or stackp  pEDIT  To clarify why I think the second might be faster, in the first case the object may or may not be added to the collection, so its not nonescaping and cannot be optimized.  In the second case, the first object allocated is clearly nonescaping so it can be optimized by the JVM and put on stack.  The second allocation only occurs in the rare case where its not already contained.p
Negative 7573 pI have a method that takes an Action as a parameter.  Actions are stored in a queue and executed when particular resources become available.  Before I invoke an Action, Id like to check if the instance it is a member of is null.  p  pI did a simple test with the following stupid example.  The Action invoked successfully after setting the invokee to null, and as expected, I got a NullReferenceException when attempting to access the property on the null invokee.  Nothing jumped out at me when examining the Action at runtime that suggested I could determine if its instance was null.  p  pI guess I could pass in the Action and the instance as parameters and test if the instance is null before invoking.  Is it possible to test for a null invokee, or is this just a case of bad design on my part  p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI added the line, p  pstrongif explosion.Target  nullstrongp  pto Bazooka.Fire, to check for a null target, but it is still invoking the delegate in my example.  p  precodepublic void LetsDoThis              var bazooka  new Bazooka         var rocketLauncher  new RocketLauncher          bazooka.LockAndLoadrocketLauncher.BlowStuffUp          rocketLauncher  null          bazooka.Fire          bool wasThisCompletelyAwesome  rocketLauncher.ThisIsAwesome       public class RocketLauncher              public void BlowStuffUp                      bool stuffIsBlowingUp  true                   public bool ThisIsAwesome                      get                              return true                             public class Bazooka              private ListltActiongt explosions  new ListltActiongt          public void LockAndLoadAction loadIt                      this.explosions.AddloadIt                   public void Fire                      foreach Action explosion in explosions                 if explosion.Target  null                     explosion.Invoke               codepre

Negative 7573 pFirst of all, hello, and thanks for reading in advance.p  pIn the past few days Ive been working on writing a useful bot for a SAMP server to use. As such, they use IRC Internet relay chat bots to display ingame information, such as things said in chat, actions done by players and so forth. So far so good, got PHP knowledge down here and there, however there is one problem which I havent been able to fix. After some time somewhere between 20 and 40 minutes, the script simply stops, and it no longer replies to PING requests from the server, and therefore the IRC server disconnects the client. It took me some time to get an idea as to what is causing this to happen, and it might be that the command prompt itself has reached some sort of line or character limit, as it sometimes stops echoing information right in the middle of a line. Something like IRCBot PRIVMSG channel Player look guys I just fou  Is there a way to prevent this from happening So far Ive put this at the beginning of my scriptp  precodesettimelimit0 inisetdisplayerrors, 1 inisetmaxexecutiontime, 0 codepre  pFun fact, none of those worked.

Negative 7573 pSo I am working on a java project that requires me to analyze the Dijkstra and Bellman Ford algorithms by running time. p  pNow I am trying to write my collected data to an xls or xlsx file.

Apache POI comes as a src folder. Dragging and dropping the folder into eclipse adds the files but the packages arent right. p  pFor example, in one of the java files the package is declared as p  ppackage org.apache.poi.hpsf.examples p  pBut when dragged into eclipse the package becomes examples.src.org.apache.poi.hpsf.examples... This causes eclipse to throw the The declared package org.apache.poi.hpsf.examples does not match the expected package examples.src.org.apache.poi.hpsf.examplesp  pNow I could simply move this package to the right folder but there are dozens of packages with this same problem p  pHow would I properly add these files to eclipse so I could use them p

Negative 7573 pI program an strongaddonaddinstrong for another program. This also allows me render stuff for the other program which uses strongOpenGLstrong. So the problem I have now is that I dont know what program the caller to my render function has already bound if any. I tried to solve the problem with a pipeline.

First of all like I implicitly said I dont know if the prebound program changes from one call to another. This leads me to the question p  pHow do I unbind stages in the pipeline do I just callp  precodeGL41.glUseProgramStagespipeline, GL41.GLALLSHADERBITS,             0 codepre  pp  pSecondly it seems more or less unefficient to bind my own vertex shader everytime I render. I introduced this because I thought there could be more than one vertexShaders bound at a time. If this is not the case I could use GL41.GLALLSHADERBITSGL41.GLVERTEXSHADERBIT to bind and unbind the other shaders and keep my shader bound to the pipeline. So question number two p  pemCan there be more than one vertexShaders bound to a pipeline at once And how do I rework my code to be efficientemp

Negative 7573 pWhats the point of idea not to load XML file at all when it has some syntax issues Today I got on problems when loading a file that had incorrect encoding defined. It had codeUTF16code headers, but encoded in codeUTF8code. I would understand that, if it wouldnt be able to determine the proper encoding, but it throws warning, that the file is codeUTF8code encoded, so it does know what to do... Its a theoretical question. No need to give any examples or saying what I tried. I know how to load the file. Simply by changing codeencodingUTF16code to codeencodingUTF8code ... but why is it such a problem Every syntax character is exactly the same in codeUTF8code and codeUTF16code... C libraries dont even care...p

Negative 7573 pI am working on system for online stores. It should be common database for one or more websites. I am using PHP  Doctrine 2 previously work with MySQL but have no problem with migration to PostgreSQL.p  pThere is a list of products in the store. Every product has title, URL address, description, image,...p  pEvery product can be published at one or more of these websites for example Store 1, Store 2, Store 3. I need to save it into one common database table because of the store, orders and easier administration but the products attributes can differ from one store to another. It means the product with ID 1 can be named like Product A at Store 1, Product B at Store 2 and Product C at Store 3. There could be SEO or translation reasons.p  pI need to search the product and its variants by its URL address.p  pNow I am considering the best way to make it.p  p1 Hstore data type in PostgreSQL. This is great function but when I think about it more and more I am not sure if its the best solution and there is no problem with it in the future development. The biggest con is that you have to use native query language when you want to find an item by value. It makes often bugs on developer side. And the second one is necessity of using PostgreSQL and impossible migration to another database MySQL, MariaDB,..p  p2 Json data type in PostgreSQL. I think is almost the same situation like hstore and there is no big difference.p  p3 Using joined table for translations. Probablby Gedmo Doctrine Extensions. I am afraid of high number of SQL queries and demands for this solution. There could be tens of thousands of products and hundreds of thousands of its variants. When I join 2 tables with 100k items and search by url it can be quite slowly. This is the biggest problem I think about.p  pI prefer hstore but I am afraid of possible problems because this is step in the dark for me. And I am not sure with translations because of load despite we plan to use own server for the system.p  pI will be really grateful you for tips and experiences.p

Negative 7573 pMy application has 3 main models companies, posts, and postdata. Im providing an in depth analytics dashboard and am having trouble figuring out what is the best method to structure the models in mongodb for the best performance.p  pThe postdata contains the fields date, number of posts for that date, average post length for that date, and company id The post contains the fields date, post text, post lengthp  pIn the dashboard view I want to display two graphs and two pieces of data.p  pgraphs one of the number of posts by date, and the other the average post length by date. data total number of posts for a date range, average post length for a date rangep  pCurrently in the views, I loop through the postdata collection to create a total posts number for that date range, and an average post length for that date range. I know I probably shouldnt be doing that much work in the views, but how else can I get the data Im looking for Should I get rid of the postdata collection and just use underscore and countBy to create the data for charts What will give me the best performance  is the preferred method.p

Negative 7573 pI came across a fun problem today.  Basically, we have thousands of subscriptions setup under a few users to dump a report into a directory on a monthly basis.  One of these users was moved to a different roledepartment, and her credentials no longer have access to the folder where they were being dumped.  So, I think the easiest solution would be to switch all of her subscriptions over to one of the other users who still has access to the folders.p  pI already know how to update the Owner.  What I need to know is how to change the credential username.  It is one of the pieces of the ExtensionSettings in the Subscription table, but it appears to be encrypted.  I already have a script that will update the credential password based on the credential username, so I would think there would be a way to update the credential username based on the owner.p

Negative 7573 pso heres the problem. I am getting some strange behavior from my php script that I use to upload images without refreshing a site.

Negative 7573 pIm playing with augmented reality in javascript using a hrefhttpsgithub.comchiliepflchilitags relnofollowChilitagsa. Im trying to make a 3D transformation of HTML elements, transformed with CSS3, a bit like a hrefhttpwww.mrdoob.comlabjavascriptthreejscss3dperiodictable relnofollowThree.jss CSS3d demoa, but simpler.p  pTo do so, I detect the 3d  transformation of tags, given in the form of a 4x4 matrix. For each transformation, I create a code.tagcode div containing a simple text and a background, which I transform using CSS transformmatrix3d... directive.p  pAll these code.tagcode divs are contained in a codecameracode div, which is supposed to apply the projection transform. This is where I am stuck. I do not manage to find a transformmatrix3d... that makes the code.tagcode divs overlap exactly the barcodes in the image.p  pSo far, my closest result is with a code   1   0 0 0   0   1 0 0   0   0 1 0 320 240 0 1 code projection matrix that translates the tag divs, but does not take their depth into account. The result is shown in this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netUdqu5 relnofollowjsFiddlea, where I hard coded the transformation matrices of the tags in the background sample snapshot.p  pI also tried with a projection matrix used to draw the tags in other demo with three.js. This matrix is a regular perspective transform, but it does not seem to work at all here. This matrix is the one commented out in the CSS.p  pI would really appreciate if someone could help me find a way to match the code.tagcode divs on the tags on the image, i.e. cover the barcodes with the purple quadrilaterals in the jsFiddle.p

Negative 7573 pstrongSituationstrongp  pThe program Im working on uses a very large SQLite database as data backend this cannot be changed and is not relevant to the question. Indexes were applied in a reasonable manner and all queries complete very quickly, but the amount of requests is also very large.p  pI identified a primary bottleneck with a particular kind of query which will read a bunch of rows that are semistatic any previous results will be valid, but additional rows might be returned. The number of possible queryresult pairs is within a few GB when stored as C data structure.p  pThe solution Im thinking of would bundle this query type in a cache class. It would store all results for a particular query in a Dictionarylike structure. Known queries will update only the possibly added subset of results for this query. So far no problem.p  pstrongProposed solutionstrongp  pSince the cache may exceed the available RAM, it is required to allow C to GC some of the cached results. Reasonably, the least used results should be purged first. For this purpose, the only solution Im only aware are WeakReferences.p  pI would thus have all results that are of supposedly low value be stored only weakly. I would then implement a continuous selfcheck on access or alternatively a background thread which checks for removed values and, if many are found, more aggressively converts strong to weak references to allow the GC to claim more.p  pThis process would leave those results which are deemed more valuable as strong refs unless the pressure gets very high.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pDo I need to implement this myself, or is there a builtin solution that accomplishes this or a similar task And more generally Is the above proposal a reasonable solution at allp

Negative 7573 pIm changing the navigation of an app to work in as follows the app will contain a single activity which initially shows a codeViewPagercode with three views fragments, and in one of the views there is a button which replaces these fragments with two other fragments.p  pI found out in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma108520463704615this answera that I cannot use codeFragmentPagerAdaptercode because it never destroys a fragment after having displayed it for the first time as I wish to swap the fragments, I will have to use codeFragmentStatePagerAdaptercode while being sure to always return a new fragment instance in the method codegetItemint positioncode. However, for the codeViewPagercode to effectively update the views after changing the adapter bound to it actually I dont change the adapter, only the data associated to it, which I use to instantiate the fragments, I must override the method codegetItemPositionObject objectcode for it to return codePOSITIONNONEcode and call codenotifyDataSetChangedcode in the adapter.

Negative 7573 pIn out website, we wish to present the users with a form that would allow them to upload picture galleries. The form consists of a codelttextareagtcode for a description, a codeltselectgtcode with sharing options and the multiple file upload field.p  pWere using jQueryfileuploads jqueryui version, as seen in here a hrefhttpblueimp.github.iojQueryFileUploadjqueryui.html relnofollowlinka and our javascript code is pretty much identical. The only significant difference is that we also added a simple submit button, that sends out a POST request to the forms action.p  pThe problem is that we need to reference ALL the files in a codeGalleryPostcode object, and the POST request that we get from the form only contains the values of codelttextareagtcode and codeltselectgtcode. Which makes sense, since the uploading is done asynchronously via separate requests.p  pSince were using OneUpUploaderBundle to handle the actual uploads, weve tried enabling the orphanage feature a hrefhttpsgithub.com1uplabOneupUploaderBundleblobmasterResourcesdocorphanage.md relnofollowdescribed herea, which emkindaem helps doing what we want, but as stated in the known limitations section, if the user does not submit the form, but starts over with a new one, the previously uploaded files will be submitted, together with the new ones, unless the session id is changed.p  pSimply put, we need a way to attach a list of files names would suffice, that have been successfully uploaded, to the forms POST request, so that we could reference them in our codeGalleryPostcode object. Or maybe there is some other way to achieve the functionality we needp

Negative 7573 pIm building a simple marketing website with Jekyll, and using Backbones routing and history behind the scenes to handle navigation. Each page of my site is its own HTML file, and my strategy is to codepreventDefaultcode on links between pages, fire off a codejQuery.getcode to grab the new HTML, and replace my codediv.contentcode with the information from the new page. p  pI know this setup is a little out of the ordinary, but I have my reasons a singlepage structure is preferable because I want precise control over page transitions, and I want to avoid requesting my webfonts each time the user navigates to a new page. Keeping the HTML files static and separate is also a win for search engines.p  pHeres the issue everything works fine when I start from my root URL, but when I begin at a different page, e.g. codemydomain.compage1code, the history breaks. During initialization, my Router attempts to route me to the page Im already on, resulting in a 404 codeCould not GET mydomain.compage1page1code. I can prevent this with a hacky codeisFirstLoadcode boolean, but that obviously sucks, and it doesnt breaks when I start clicking around and use the back button to return to codepage1code.p  pI recognize that one solution is to write some serverside logic that serves my codeindex.htmlcode regardless of what URL is hit. Im not sure how to do this, however, particularly for a local environment. Is it about PHP or .htaccess Is this even what I have to do Am I going about this totally the wrong wayp  pThanksp

Negative 7573 pI am trying to install numpy on a remote host where I have no admin rights. I have sucessfully installed Python 2.7 and pip inside a virtualenv ,and can use pip to install trivial things like codepip install Markdowncode. But if I pip install numpy or scipy, it errors on codeSystemError Cannot compile Python.h. Perhaps you need to install pythondevpythondevel.code I do not have rights to sudo aptget or aptget, so can not do codesudo aptget install python27develcode or codesudo aptget install pythondevelcode. I wanted to build from source so that I could use the option user  but the source is a .deb file and building it requires even more things I have to aptget. I tried contacted the admin but I am advised to keep my own installations in my own local environment. What should I do The OS system is  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.p

Negative 7573 pI have a typical phphtmljavascript application. There is one main HTML page with a lot of javascript and AJAX calls to PHP to receivesend data.p  pAmong other things, the app tracks certain user actions, recording what the action is and the timestamp of the action. Im getting the timestamp in javascript as codenew Date.getTimecode. I send the action log to the server, which uses codedt  datehis, timestamp  1000code to get a humandigestable time. Note that for printing purposes Im only interested in time element, but I need to store the full datetime in the database for later audits.p  pMy clients can be located anywhere in the world.  What I noticed is that when I call codedatecode on the timestamp received from the client, the server applies the timezone offset of where the server is located most likely, the default timezone from codephp.inicode.  Thus, if the client in London is passing a timestamp for 100000, the serverprinted time ends up being 20000, as the server is in California.p  pI can easily send the timezone UTC offset with the data i.e. the value of codenew Date.getTimezoneOffsetcode.  However I dont quite understand how I should use this timezone offset to get the right printout for the client.  Its probably going to be some sort of combination of getting the defualt tz and using the tz from the client  but I just cant get my head around it.p  pAll I want is that the timestamp for 100000 be displayed as 100000 regardless of where the client is or a server is.p

Negative 7573 pI am trying to capture a video with matlab.  The Video might have a duration of about 1560 minutes, so it is pretty big and I store it to disk instead of memory. I dont need online precessing I want to capture the video in high resolution 1280x720 would be fine. But with High Resolution, I get the problem, that Matlab does not log the data fast enough to the disk. p  pHere are my observations Resolution of 640x480 Everything works fine. Resolution of 800x600 or above The utilization of my RAM increases linearly, while capturing the video and decreases linearly after i stop capturing the video. After the stop command, Matlabs Command Window is blocked for some time. While that time, I can see tat the .avi  file is growing. Of course, the higher I pick the resolution, the faster the RAM utilization increases. p  pSo my problem is, that I cannot use a Resolution of 1280x720, because after caputring the video for about 5 minutes, my whole RAM 8GB is utilized and I get an awful out of memory error. Interesing fact the video that uses my whole RAM has only about 300 MB. That must be the MJPEG compression ratep  pHas anybody got an idea how to solve my problem Is matlabs VideoWriter class just too slow and there is nothing I can do Other softwares for video capturing are also able to make HD Videos..p  pBest regards, Richip  pFor the completeness, here is the code that i usedp  precodepath  CDatentesttest.avi videoRec  videoinputwinvideo,1,MJPG1280x720 src  getselectedsourcevideoRec src.FrameRate  30.0000 setvideoRec,TriggerRepeat,inf setvideoRec, LoggingMode, disk logger  VideoWriterpath setlogger,FrameRate,str2doublesrc.FrameRate videoRec.Disklogger  logger  startvideoRec codepre

Negative 7573 pSo,p  pIm doing some D3 work on source data 3GB. I figure its maybe reasonable to load 110 mb in a single call before people are going to be annoyed with load times, so Im looking at a factor of 1000 compression on my dataset before I can throw it in browser. Most of this is accomplished with various aggregations, but the less information I have to throw away, the richer the interaction, so Ive been looking at binary JSON formats to maybe get a factor of 2 or so for free maybe more if because I think I can replace some long hashes with some short integers.p  pAnyways, actual question. Do D3 xhr requests work with BSON, UBJSON, or smile It seems like none of the 3 have come far enough to have an official associated MIME type theres some recommendations but I didnt see them on the official list. Also, considering theyre based off of strongJSONstrong, there seems to be little mention of Javascript in the BSON, UBJSON, smile parsing libraries is that because Javascript can read them natively, or no one has found it worthwhile to implement... p

Negative 7573 pI need to add share functionality in my app with UIActivityViewController but I have done a lot of research and found that e.g in IOS7 and IOS8 if user has not logined or added account in settings then UIActivityViewController will not load the icons of twitter and Facebook etc. I have seen an app named MusiXMatch they have used the sharing on there songs share module.They are showing Facebook and twitter icons without adding the accounts in settings. I am wondering how this is happening. It seems that it looks likes the default UIActivityViewController but what I have found in my research my UIActivityViewController did not get the icons except login into accounts. This app surprise me a lot. I have to make like this. I have done this think by using OWActivityViewController but it is IOS6 layout. I need to make it as default IOS7 and IOS8. Need solution asap. Thanks a lot.p
Negative 7573 pI have a login setup for one of my sites where the user types their information into a login popup on the home page, which then submits the information back to a servlet and then receives a response back via JSON. The home page then proceeds to send the user to their profile page or alternatively displays an error e.g., if username and password do not match.p  precode.ajax     dataType jsonp,     async false,     url loginLocation,     type GET,     crossDomain true,     cache false,     xhrFields crossDomain           withCredentials true       ,     data key1 value1, key2 value2, ..., keyNvalueN,     success functiondata         if data ampamp data.status ampamp data.status  success              window.location  profileLocation          else              errorHandler              ,     error errorHandler  codepre  pI am looking to change this from a GET request to a POST in order to prevent arbitrary query strings being sent into the servlet. However, it appears that there are several considerations at play here with regards to how the solution ought to be laid out. It mustp  ul liuse POST instead of GETli libe a crossdomain request the login page and the servlet are on different domains over both of which I have accesscontrolli liuse the withCredentials parameter the login functionality relies on the JSESSIONID cookie so this parameter is requiredli libe compatible with IE8 and aboveli ul  pI have tried looking into crossdomain ajax requests that fit the above criteria, but the major sticking point seems to be the IE8IE9 compatibility. Approaches such as easyXDM appear to be ambiguous as to support for these browsers I have seen conflicting reports online as to how it works in IE8 and I dont want to run into the danger of realizing it wont work halfway through implementation.p  pSo in short, is there a way to do crossdomain ajax requests using POST and with the withCredentials parameter, that is also compatible with IE8 Is easyXDM an appropriate solution to thisp

Negative 7573 pI understand one could do something like codeModel.destroyallstatus inactivecode. I wish my case were this simple, but I cant do it like that. I have an encrypted string column that maps to an array of integers via the attrencrypted gem which makes this cumbersome.p  pBasically, I have an array like this codearray  [object1, object2, object3, object4]code where each object is model object.p  pI want to be able to do something like codeModel.destroyallarraycode or codeModel.deleteallarraycode, but I am unable to do this.p  pI even tried the following codeModel.destroyallarray.mapampidcode and codeModel.deleteallarray.mapampidcode and I couldnt successfully delete them.p  pI want to be as efficient as possible and I dont think codearray.mapampdestroycode or codearray.mapampdeletecode would be efficient as Id get codeNcode calls.

Negative 7573 pI have a dataset that contains a large number of misspelled words and words that are concatenated e.g. todayisaniceday.

I am assuming that changing the API Key that getForm uses to access google.search I could overcome this limitation. Therefore, I was wondering if someone knows how to change the API Key after a number of getForm searches.p

Negative 7573 pI need som expertise helpp  pI am not new to VBA or Excel, but Ive come accross this weird thing I cant find a way around. Ive been googling for a long time, so I thought Id ask here.p  pBackground I have a excelsheet with a lot of VBA I am developing for my job, with an activeX combobox being filled with items from an access database on startup. The user can pick an item, which automatically on lost focuson change populates some textboxes with data from the database. Then the user can edit the textboxvalues loaded from the database, which in turn adjusts some calculated results.p  pNow, the question If the user adjusts a parameter, but wants to go back to the default values  i.e. reload the database values  selecting the same combobox entry again does not fire any event that Ive found  since it is already selected. I would think that the clickevent should fire  but no. The changeevent obviously does not fire...p  pAny way to work around this Any event I havent thought ofp  pNote Current workaround solution would be that the user has to select another item, then back to the one he or she wants, or adding a reset button. I dont like either of those workarounds, so if theres anything I can do...p  pThanksp

Negative 7573 pI have a website made in C .NET MVC4 that uses Office 365 login to get into the private area. It works fine on our development server when accessing it using the local IP address. However if we try to access it using the public IP address or domain name the login process does not complete and leaves a blank page literally.p  pThe process of authenticating is as followsp  blockquote   p1 Access the public part of the web site.br   2 Click the Login using Office 365 account button.br   3 User is redirected to Microsoft Office account login page.br   4 User inputs hisher account info an clicks the login button.br   5 User is redirected back to our website, now   authenticated. This is where the process fails if we use public, the   public IPdomain name and returns a blank page.p blockquote  pIn both cases accessing from local or public network the user actually gets authenticated on hisher Microsoft Office account.

Negative 7573 pI want users of my android application to be able to login with facebook and google.p  pMy REST API Methods in Google App Engine are implemented already, but not protected. Now I want to protect some of this methods. no web application necessaryp  pOne way to do that is using the GAE integrated authentication, which works good until you want to use Facebook, Twitter or other OAuth 2.0 Providers, that are a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1827997isfacebookanopenidprovidernot OpenID Providersa. p  pAnother way would be to implement my own authentication mechanism. From my current point of view this sounds like a solution. I would create accounts based on any OAuth 2.0 provider I want to implement even Facebook. So the user authenticates via FB, and I use the userinformation which I can access after the user signed in to create a new user account on my GAE user store. But this solution only covers authentication sign up, sign in, not authorizationaccessing API methods as authenticated user.p  pQuestionsp  ol lipIs that the right way to do  Since GAE supports some authorization mechanism, I think in general it would be better to use it. But afaik, it would not work with fb, twitter and other important oauth 2.0 providerspli lipHow to implement such an authorization mechanism the right way on GAEpli lipIs there a better way How do you do thatpli ol

Negative 7573 pI am migrating a Spring MVC app from JBoss 7.1.1 to Wildfly 8.1, which has required encouraged me to use the new a hrefhttpsdocs.jboss.orgauthordisplayWFLY8Undertow28web29subsystemconfiguration relnofollowundertow modulea instead of the older web module.  Things are coming right along, except that now requests to codecode, which used to invoke the controller method annotated with codeRequestMappingcode, no longer reach the controller method.  Instead, it appears that such requests are being immediately rewritten not redirected to codeindex.htmlcode.  Since I dont have and have never needed such a file, all requests for codecode are now generating 404 errors.p  pInterestingly, all of the emotherem codeRequestMappingcodeannotated controller methods continue to function normally.p  pHere is the relevant snippet from my codestandalone.xmlcode file.p  precodeltsubsystem xmlnsurnjbossdomainundertow1.1gt     ltbuffercache namedefaultgt     ltserver namedefaultservergt         lthttplistener namedefault socketbindinghttp maxpostsize4194304gt         lthost namedefaulthost aliaslocalhostgt         lthostgt     ltservergt     ltservletcontainer namedefaultgt         ltjspconfig developmenttruegt     ltservletcontainergt ltsubsystemgt codepre  pI suspect that when the codesubsystemcode definition for Wildflys undertow module does not explicitly declare a codehandlercode, Wildfly defaults to a codefilecode handler, which may be responsible for the the URL rewrites  but I am not certain of this.p  pa hrefhttpundertow.iodocumentationcorebuiltinhandlers.html relnofollowDocumentation about handlersa in the Undertow project, upon which Wildflys undertow module is based, indicate support for a Redirect handler.  I have considered using this to work around the unexpected  rewriting, but it is not clear to me whether Wildflys undertow module supports this, and if it does, how to configure it in codestandalone.xmlcode.  Even if I was able, however, I think it would feel like a hack, and Id prefer to get to the root of the problem no pun intended instead.p  pThere are many S.O. questions describing disappointing codeRequestMappingcode behavior, and many answers suggesting using other paths such as codecode, codeindexcode, etc., but dont forget the existing unchanged code works just fine in JBoss 7.1.1.  Also, none of those questions mention Wildfly, which is probably the key consideration for this question.  Nevertheless, I experimented with the various suggestions and got nowhere.

In one example author use try or tryTo prefix to distinct public method and private method performing appropriate logic as bellow.p  precodepublic void doSomething      try          tryToDoSomething     catch Exception ex          handle exception        public void tryDoSomething throws Exception       appropriate logic  codepre  pIs this a correct convention Maybe method names should be inverse Would it be better to prefix method with try that contains trycatch block as below similar to C conventionp  precodepublic void tryDoSomething      try          doSomething     catch Exception ex          handle exception        public void doSomething throws Exception       appropriate logic  codepre  pIn the first approach public method name is shorter and easier to understand. On the other side to make a code consistent I should prefix every method that throws an exception. What convention do you preferp  pliWhat name do you prefer for exception variables in trycatch block  exception, ex, e  Its a detail but Im really interested. p
Negative 7573 pEDIT ANSWERED. Upon examination of the g.drawLines in my drawBackground function, I was drawing a point, not a line. It was user error.p  pOur school has written a header that simplifies much of allegro 5. Im writing a program that will use that header GameEngineV4 to simply emulate checkers, however, Im having some difficulty getting the board to display to the screen. Here is my codep  precodeinclude GameEngineV4.h include ltiostreamgt using namespace std  void drawBackgroundGameEngineV4, const int, const int  int main      const int BOARDWIDTH  600     const int BOARDMARGIN  100     GameEngineV4 g                  instantiate graphic object      g.initializePanel800,800          initialize Window     g.setBackgroundg.CYAN                 color the background      drawBackgroundg, BOARDMARGIN, BOARDWIDTH       cleanup     g.displayPanel      systemPause     g.displayDelay1.0                 wait 10 seconds     g.closePanel     return 0   void drawBackgroundGameEngineV4 g, const int BOARDMARGIN, const int BOARDWIDTH     g.setColorg.BLACK     int i  0     int offset  BOARDWIDTH  8  i Variable to hold the amount a line should be shifted from original.     for i  0 i lt 9 i         offset  BOARDWIDTH  8  i         g.drawLineBOARDMARGIN, BOARDMARGIN  offset, BOARDMARGIN, BOARDMARGIN  offset Horizontal lines         g.drawLineBOARDMARGIN  offset, BOARDMARGIN, BOARDMARGIN  offset, BOARDMARGIN Vertical lines       codepre  pThe difficulty lies somewhere in the drawBackground function. I had tested the drawBackground function first by replacing the drawLine code in the for loop with codeg.drawLine50, 50  offset, 450, 450  offsetcode and the code displayed just fine then. Why would changing it to calculate using constants affect my codep  pCoded and compiled in Visual Studio 2013 on Windows 7.p  pEDIT Of course, it would be a bit simpler if I included the header and implementation for GameEngineV4p  pHeres GameEngineV4.hp  precodeifndef GameEngineV4 define GameEngineV4 include ltstringgt include ltallegro5allegro.hgt include ltallegro5allegroprimitives.hgt

Negative 7573 pI was trying to find the list of Nodes via getNodes method in a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comandroidreferencecomgoogleandroidgmswearableNodeApi relnofollowNodeAPIa in GooglePlayServices.  p  pI have one LG G Live watch, one Samsung Gear 2 Tizen OS and one Google Glass. p  pMy LG G Watch has a connection with a companion APP via a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comandroidreferencecomgoogleandroidgmscommonapiGoogleApiClient relnofollowGoogleAPIClienta on phone Samsung S4. I have one application which checks if the watch is connected with phone, and if not connected, notify user about the same. I was using getNodes method for this, and I connected glass and gear with phone with My Glass and Gear Manager thats it. I was under the impression that both glass and gear would also get shown in getNodes list, but only G Live came in the list.p  pSo, now, I think that device must be connected with GoogleApiClient with phone via a companion App, in order to show it as a node. That thing said, what if I am connecting GlassTizen with phone via GoogleApiClient but in other separate  companion App on phone. Would it then show it as a node Which brings me to the initial question, how do we define nodes in Google Play Services and If itll show them as nodes, how would I detect if it is a watch or glass or gear  I can register devices for this issue, but I want to avoid that, I tried getDisplayName and getId, but both return same thing i.e. UUID of the node.p

Negative 7573 pThe reason to use prepared statements are twofoldp  ol liPrevent SQL injection by adding data from the outside world only as parameters.li liImprove performance by letting the DB preparse the statement once and reuse it many times by just passing the parameters.li ol  pBut prepared statements in JDBC are tied in with a connection. And we should use connection pooling. This means in a typical code sample I have top  ul liobtain a connection from the poolli lirecreate the prepared statement every time, because there is no other sensible way to get it back li ul  pWhen using JdbcConnectionPool, the simple connection pool that comes with H2, I think statements are not cached. Does it mean there is rather a negative impact on performance when using prepared statements  which I can not really avoid due to 1 above.p

Currently it tabs the first field and when the second field is scanned the form is submitted, which is working as intended but it completely starts the form over, i would like it to keep the first field ordernumber after submitting so we can scan multiple chipnumbers on the same ordernumber then have a Master submit button if you will to send it all through when the employee is done with that order number and start with a blank form.

Negative 7573 pstrong Background strong Im trying to implement autoupdate feature for desktop java application, which is designed to use some sort of supervisor which can decide where to load application from i.e. are we trying to load new version or we keep up with current.

All requests to load classes on newly created threads lets call them ThreadN are failed .p  pInteresting thing I discovered is that  lets say ThreadN fails to load ClassA  If I change code so that ClassA will be forced to load from Thread1  then there will be no error on ThreadN  I checked  context classloader of Thread1 and ThreadN  are the samep  pSo it looks like on ThreadN I can use cached classes but cannot load new classes. p  pAny thoughts to fix thatp

I start the clientserver applicationp  p2. I start my program with a Threadp  p3. I send one message from the client to my program, my program delivers this message to the server, the server answers to my program, my program delivers the message back to the client successfully.p  p4. Now, i kill and restart the clientserver application without restarting my programp  p5. I repeat step 3 but at this time, when the program reaches the lenmessagefromdestiny  streamFromDestiny.readbuffermsgdestiny it produces the catch that i need to code for ask if the server is really alive that is true in this step.

Negative 7573 pIm creating an Ada program for Windows that needs to be able to pass strings to some functions written in C. Until now I have been manipulating the strings in Ada using the codeUnboundedStringcode type, and then converting the data to an codeInterfaces.C.chararraycode before passing it to the C functions.p  pThis works fine, only performance is a bit of an issue on slower, older computers. The C function is sometimes called repeatedly on a slightly modified version of a string, and requires the codeUnboundedStringcode to be converted to a similar codechararraycode every time. The strings arent modified by the C functions, so the only ever have to be converted to codechararraycode.p  pI have thought of storing the strings in codechararraycode, and converting from an Ada type each time the string is manipulated. The data is passed to C more often than it is changed, so it would improve performance. The problem with this approach is that often the length of the string will change, sometimes by a lot, and there is no way of knowing the maximum length beforehand.p  pThe ideal solution would be to have something similar to an codeUnboundedStringcode only storing the string as a codechararraycode. By this I mean something that is dynamically sized, allocating a new array when the old one isnt big enough and it should allow Ada codeCharacterscodecodeStringscode to be inserted and also removed into the array, converting only those characters to C codecharscode.p  pIs there any relatively easy, fast way of doing this without having to implement it myself Or is there any other quick way of manipulating Ccompatible strings in Ada Thanks in advance for any suggestions.p

The optimization code itself is written in C. In order to make the code as efficient as possible I also reimplemented the objective function in C. At the current stage the role of R is to provide an interface to the C code using .Call.p  h1Goalh1  pI would like the package to be able to handle any user supplied objective function. However, I do not want to call R functions from C, that would incur a large overhead and will most likely be excruciatingly slow.p  pstrongWhat I really want is a way to pass a limited class of R functions Those you would typically see as cost functions in statistical and machine learning as a parameter, have this R function converted to a C functionstrong and then subsequently used as an objective function in the optimization algorithm.p  h1Solution Ideah1  pR has a strong parenting with LISP. It is pretty straight forward to get a functions abstract syntax treeAST. I am thinking it emmayem be possible to parse the AST as a C function and then either compile it or just pass it dynamically I dont know if that is even is doable in Cp  h1Questionsh1  ul liIs the solution idea above even feasibleli liIs there any other way to do thisli liWhat must I learn to be able to do this li ul  pNote Doing this as an R package is not necessary. Trying to do this inside the rigid structure of an R package might make things even more difficult. p

Negative 7573 pI was reviewing an interview question and comparing notes with a friend, and we have different ideas on one with respect to CPU caching.p  pConsider a large set of data, such as a large array of codedoublecode, iep  precodedouble data[1024] codepre  pConsider using a dynamically allocated onthefly linked list to store the same number of elements. The question asked for a description of a number of tradeoffsp  ol liWhich allows for quicker random access we both agreed the array was quicker, since you didnt have to traverse the list in a linear fashion codeOncode, just provide an index codeO1code.li liWhich is quicker for comparing two lists of the same length we both decided that if it was just primitive data types, the array would allow for a codememcmpcode, while the linked list required elementwise comparison plus dereferencing overhead.li liWhich allowed for more efficient caching if you were accessing the same element several timesli ol  pIn point code3code, this is where our opinions differed. I contended that that the CPU is going to try and cache the entire array, and if the array is obscenely large, it cant be stored in cache, and therefore there will be no caching benefit. With the linked list, individual elements can be cached. Therefore, linked lists lend themselves to cache hits more than static arrays do when dealing with a very large number of elements.p  pTo the question Which of the two is better for cache hits, and can modern systems cache part of an array, or do they need the whole array or it wont try Any sort of references to technical documents or standards I could also use to provide a definitive answer would help a lot.p  pThanksp

Negative 7573 pWe develop on Windows and use git. Locally, line endings are CRLF and all the magic in between means that the files on our production server CentOS will have LF. Everyone is happy.p  pWe also use a Windows only tool to generate a LOT of the files for us PHP Maker. This app generates files with Windows line endings.p  pStill all good.p  pBut, we have 2 non Windows developers one on a Mac, one on Ubuntu Mate. For the non PHP Maker generated files, their editors work with files that have their OS specific line endings and all the magic in between means that those files end up with the correct line endings on our production server. And when the Windows developers interact with the non PHP Maker files, it is still all good with CRLF line endings locally.p  pEverything seems fine.p  pRight up to the point where the non Windows developers have to run the PHP Maker application in their Windows VM on their MacUbuntu machines.p  pThen things seem to go a little wonky.p  pThe net effect is that when these developers run PHP Maker and commit from their development machines not the VM, the line endings seem to get ... confused ... and somehow when the windows developers get hold of these files, they are 100 whitespace different  and it is JUST line endings.p  pIm willing to do research but I dont know enough to work this out as I am only on Windows where it all just works as expected and dont have access to the MacUbuntu setups to diagnose the issue.p  pSo. What am I supposed to do We have no issue enforcing things one way or the other as in for good or bad, this is how we want things setup.p  pBut some ideas, suggestions, recommendations, perfect answers, etc. are all appreciated.p  pRegards,p  pRichard Quadling.p

Negative 7573 pI have an android application which is communicating with a backend server.Currently Im using Basic authentication in the header for each of the  API request.

As the users got increased my concern is that the APIs are much more hackable with just Basic Authentication.p  pWhen I searched online, I found token based authentication will be better in which during the Login, a token will be issued to the app dedicated for that user alone and will be using that token for furthur communication.

I read through a lot of other posts like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11369382androidonlistitemclicknotgettingcalledinlistactivityAndroid onListItemClick not getting called in ListActivitya and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14373527onlistitemclickisnotgettingcalledonlistactivityonListItemClick is not getting called on ListActivitya where people recommended setting the widgets in the list to codeandroidfocusablefalsecode, however this does not seem to be working out for me.

Negative 7573 pI recently acquired a Firefly MV USB 2.0 camera and downloaded the FlyCapture 2.8 SDK to interface with it. However I cannot even get it set up to run the example code provided. I have a 64bit windows computer and I downloaded the 64 bit SDK. I am using C in Visual Studio 2013. I created a project and added the include and lib64 directories to the project. My code so far looks like thisp  precodeinclude FlyCapture2.h using namespace FlyCapture2 int main      Camera cam     Error errors     FC2Version version     return 0  codepre  pAs you can see, very minimalist. The codeErrorcode and codeFC2Versioncode classes show up fine but the codeCameracode class does not, even though I can see that it is included in the header. I even tried explicitly codeinclude Camera.hcode but it still doesnt work. When I opened the codeCamera.hcode file inside Visual Studio to get a look inside, the class definition of Camera is there as expected, but in the line codeclass FLYCAPTURE2API Camera  public CameraBasecode, the codeFLYCAPTURE2APIcode is underlined and Visual Studio gives the following error codeError expected a type specifiercode even though I havent changed the file since I downloaded it. p  pThe other two classes load fine but I cant even get this minimalist setup code to work. Im sure my mistake is something simple I just cant seem to figure out what it is. p  pAny help is appreciated.p
Negative 7573 pI am faced with a task, where I have to design a web application in .net framework. In this application users will only 99 of the time have readonly access as they will just see data codeSELECTcode.p  pHowever the backend database is going to be the beast where every minute there will be records updated  inserted  deleted. The projection is that at very minimum there will be about 10 million records added to system in a year, in less than 5 tables collectively.p  pstrongQuestionRequest 1strongp  pAs these updatesinserts will happen very frequently every minute or 2 the latest I was hoping to get some tips so that when some rows are being changed a select query may not cause a thread deadlock or viceversa.p  pstrongQuestionRequest 2strongp  pMy calculated guess is that in normal situations, only few hundred records will be inserted every minute 247 and updated  deleted based on some conditions. If I write a C tool which will get data from any number of sources xml, csv or direct from some tables from a remote db, a configuration file or registry setting will dictate which format the data is being imported from and then do the insert  update  deleted, will this be fast enough andor will cause deadlock issuesp  pI hope my questions are elaborate enough... Please let me know if this is all vague...p  pThanks in advancep
