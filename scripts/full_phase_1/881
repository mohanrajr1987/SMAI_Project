Positive 881 pIm working at a company that processes very large CSV files. Clients upload the file to Amazon S3 via a hrefhttpswww.filepicker.com relnofollowfilepickera. Then multiple server processes can read the file in parallel i.e. starting from different points to process it and store it in a database. Optionally the clients may zip the file before uploading.p  ol liAm I correct that the ZIP format does not allow decompression of a single file in parallel That is, there is no way to have multiple processes read the ZIP file from different offsets maybe with some overlap between blocks and stream uncompressed data from thereli ol  pIf I am correct, then I want a way to take the ZIP file on S3 and produce an unzipped CSV, also on S3.p  ol start2 liDoes Amazon provide any services that can perform this task simply I was hoping that Data Pipeline could do the job, but it seems to have limitations. For example CopyActivity does not support copying multipart Amazon S3 files a hrefhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comdatapipelinelatestDeveloperGuidedpobjectcopyactivity.html relnofollowsourcea seems to suggest that I cant unzip anything larger than 5GB using that. My understanding of Data Pipeline is very limited so I dont know how suitable it is for this task or where I would look.li liIs there any SaaS that does the jobli ol  pI can write code to download, unzip, and multipart upload the file back to S3, but I was hoping for an efficient, easily scalable solution. AWS Lambda would have been ideal for running the code to avoid provisioning unneeded resources but execution time is limited to 60 seconds.

For example, the source zip file is 66KB, the decrypted file is 104KB.p  pI have had similar problems with other compressed test files .jpg, .png, etc.p  pThe only files I have successfully decrypted and opened are uncompressed text files  .txt and .css, so I know that the key pair is working.p  pWhen trying to open a decrypted zip file, the error I get is There was a problem reading the contents of myfile.zip.  The archive file is incomplete.p  pEDIT If I run the gpg command from Ubuntu it works correctly gpg homedir homeuser.pgphome output homeusermyfile.zip.gpg encrypt homeusermyfile.zip, so this problem is isolated to Python.p

Positive 881 pI am writing a module that needs to be able to deal with a large number of zip file pretty fast.  As such, I was going to use something implemented in C rather than Python from which Ill be calling the extractor.  To try and test which method would be fastest, I wrote a test script comparing linuxs unzip command vs the czipfile python module wrapper around a c zip extractor.  As a control, I used the native python zipfile module.  p  pThe script creates a zipfile thats around 100MB out of 100 1MB files.  It looks at 3 scenarios. A The files are all just random bytestrings.  BThe files are just random hex characters  CThe files are uniform random sentences with line breaks.p  pIn all cases, the performance of zipfile implemented in python was on par with or significantly better than the two extractors implemented in c.  p  pAny ideas why this could be happening  The script is attached.  Requires czipfile and the unzip command available in the shell.p  precodefrom datetime import datetime import zipfile import czipfile import os, binascii, random  class ZipTestErrorException     pass    class ZipTest      procs  [zipfile, czipfile, os]     typemap  rRandom, hRandom Hex, sSentences       three types. tr is random noise files directly out of urandom. th is urandom noise converted to ascii characters. ts are randomly constructed sentences with line breaks.     def initself         print Testing Random Byte Files          self.testr         self.testh         self.tests         staticmethod     def randname         return binascii.b2ahexos.urandom10      def makefileself, t          fname  self.randname         f  openfname, w         if t  r             f.writeos.urandom1048576         elif t  h             f.writebinascii.b2ahexos.urandom1048576         elif t  s             for i in range76260                 ops  [dog, cat, rat]                 ops2  [meat, wood, fish]                 n1  intrandom.random10  3                 n2  intrandom.random10  3                 sentence  The 0 eats 1     .formatops[n1], ops2[n2]                 f.writesentence         else             raise ZipTestErrorInvalid Type         f.close         return fname      create a 100MB zip file to test extraction on.     def createziptestself, t         self.filenames  []         self.outputnames  []         for i in range100             self.filenames.appendself.makefilet         self.zipname  self.randname         output  zipfile.ZipFileself.zipname, w, zipfile.ZIPDEFLATED         for f in self.filenames             output.writef         output.close       def cleanupself, remzip  False         for f in self.filenames             os.removef         self.filenames  []         for f in self.outputnames             os.removef         self.outputnames  []         if remzip             if getattrself, zipname, False                 os.removeself.zipname             self.zipname  False      def displayresself, res, t         print  0 results .formatself.typemap[t]         for p in self.procs             print 0  1 milliseconds.formatp, strres[p]       def testself, t         self.createziptestt         res  self.unzip         self.displayresres, t         self.cleanupremzip  True       def unzipself         res  dict         for p in self.procs             self.cleanup             res[p]  getattrself, unzipwith0.formatp         return res      def unzipwithzipfileself         return self.unzipwithpythonzipfile      def unzipwithczipfileself         return self.unzipwithpythonczipfile      def unzipwithpythonself, mod         f  openself.zipname         zf  mod.ZipFilef         start  datetime.now         op  .         for name in zf.namelist             zf.extractname,op             self.outputnames.appendname         end  datetime.now         total  endstart         ms  total.microseconds         ms  total.seconds  1000000         return ms 1000      def unzipwithosself         f  openself.zipname         start  datetime.now         zf  zipfile.ZipFilef         for name in zf.namelist             self.outputnames.appendname            os.systemunzip qq 0.formatf.name         end  datetime.now         total  endstart         ms  total.microseconds         ms  total.seconds  1000000         return ms 1000       if name  main     ZipTest codepre

Negative 881 pIm seeing performance problems with retrieving multiple instances of objects that have many relationships with other objects. Im using Spring and Hibernates JPA implementation with MySQL. The issue is that when executing a JPA query, Hibernate does not automatically join to other tables. This results in nr  1 SQL queries, where n is the number of objects being retrieved and r is the number of relationships.p  pExample, a Person lives at an Address, has many Hobbies, and has visited many Countriesp  precodeEntity public class Person      Id public Integer personId         public String name         ManyToOne public Address address         ManyToMany public SetltHobbygt hobbies         ManyToMany public SetltCountrygt countriesVisited  codepre  pWhen I perform a JPA query to get all Persons named Bob, and there are 100 Bobs in the databasep  precodeSELECT p FROM Person p WHERE p.nameBob codepre  pHibernate translates this to 301 SQL queriesp  precodeSELECT ... FROM Person WHERE nameBob SELECT ... FROM Address WHERE personId1 SELECT ... FROM Address WHERE personId2 ... SELECT ... FROM Hobby WHERE personId1 SELECT ... FROM Hobby WHERE personId2 ... SELECT ... FROM Country WHERE personId1 SELECT ... FROM Country WHERE personId2 ... codepre  pAccording to the Hibernate FAQ a hrefhttpwww.hibernate.org118.htmlA23herea and a hrefhttpwww.hibernate.org117.htmlA30herea, the solution is to specify LEFT JOIN or a hrefhttpwww.hibernate.org117.htmlA12LEFT OUTER JOIN for manytomanya in the query. So now my query looks likep  precodeSELECT p, a, h, c FROM Person p LEFT JOIN p.address a LEFT OUTER JOIN p.hobbies h LEFT OUTER JOIN p.countriesVisited c WHERE p.name  Bob codepre  pThis works, but there appears to be a bug if theres more than one LEFT OUTER JOIN in which case Hibernate is incorrectly looking for a nonexistent columnp  precodecould not read column value from result set personId692 Column personId692 not found. codepre  pThe bug behavior appears to be possibly addressed by a hrefhttpopensource.atlassian.comprojectshibernatebrowseHHH3636Hibernate Core bug HHH3636a. Unfortunately the fix is not part of any released Hibernate JAR. Ive ran my application against the snapshot build but the bug behavior is still present. Ive also built my own Hibernate Core JAR from the latest code in the repository and the bug behavior is still present. So maybe HHH3636 doesnt address this.p  pThis Hibernate performance limitation is very frustrating. If I query for 1000 objects then 1000r  1 SQL queries are made to the database. In my case I have 8 relationships so I get 8001 SQL queries, which results in horrible performance. The official Hibernate solution to this is to left join all relationships. But this isnt possible with more than one manytomany relationships due to the bug behavior. So Im stuck with left joins for manytoone relationships and nr1 queries due to the manytomany relationships. I plan to submit the LEFT OUTER JOIN problem as a Hibernate bug, but in the meantime my customer needs an app that has reasonable performance. I currently use a combination of batch fetch BatchSize, ehcache and custom inmemory caching but the performance is still pretty poor it improved retrieving 5000 objects from 30 to 8 seconds. The bottom line is that too many SQL queries are hitting the database. p  pSo, my questions, is it possible to use Hibernate in performance sensitive applications where tables have multiple relationships with each other I would love to hear how successful Hibernate uses address performance. Should I be hand writing SQL which somewhat defeats the purpose of using Hibernate Should I denormalize my database schema to reduce the number of joined tables Should I not be using Hibernate if I need fast query performance Is there something fasterp

Negative 881 pIm developing a Queue simulation, using a Swing Timer to dequeue objects after certain amounts of time.

Negative 881 pI was thinking about the classic issue of lazy singleton initialization  the whole matter of the inefficiency ofp  precodeif instance  null      instance  new Foo  return instance codepre  pAnyone who knows what a Singleton is is familiar with the issueyou only need the if once. Its trivial but irritating.p  pSo, I thought of an alternate solution, at least for .NETalthough it should work anywhere that has some equivalent to function pointersp  precodepublic class Foo      private delegate Foo FooReturner      private static Foo innerFoo      private static FooReturner fooReturnHandler  new FooReturnerInitialFooReturner      public static Foo Instance              get                      return fooReturnHandler                   private static Foo InitialFooReturner              innerFoo  new Foo         fooReturnHandler  new FooReturnerNewFooReturner          return innerFoo           private static Foo NewFooReturner              return innerFoo        codepre  pIn short  the Instance returns a delegate method. The delegate is initially set to a method that initializes your instance, then changes the delegate to point at a simple Return method.p  pNow, I like to think Im not terrible at my job, but I have no pretensions about being awesome. I have not seen an example of this code anywhere.p  pErgo, I come to the conclusion that I am missing something. Something major. Either that the whole problem is too trivial to bother thinking that much about or this does something horrible that will destroy the universe. Or I fail at searching and therefore havent seen the hundreds of developers using this method. Something, anyway.p  pI was hoping the good folks here at Stack Overflow could clue me in as to whatleaving aside the controversy on whether one should use a Singleton at all.p  pEDIT for clarificationp  pThis is not performance codealthough if the design actively degrades performance beyond the traditional model, that would be interesting to know. p  pIt was written purely as proofofconcept, and I am further aware that it is not threadsafe as it properly should be. Is there any reason why it could NOT be made threadsafe by its very nature p
Negative 881 pIm trying to write a simple server with Thrift. At the beginning it looked promising, but Ive stumbled into a problem with a number of clients connected at the same time. Im using TThreadPoolServer, which allows 4 client to connect and then blocks other clients until I kill one from the connected.

We have the ability to recruit resources  this takes a variable amount of time. We can recruit for a fixed interval of time.p  pTo give an idea of scale There will be about 20 resources at any given time, 100 outstanding jobs. Completion of jobs takes 515 seconds. Recruiting a resource takes about 12 minutes, and we can recruit from 130 minutes of time rerecruiting is allowed. We dont have much headsup on jobs being submitted, maybe a few seconds.p  pThe goal is completion of jobs with lowest cost resource usage for a given average latency job completion time.p  pId appreciate pointers to algorithms, software libraries, or approaches to solving this problem.p

Even so, Im having trouble talking them into 2, which should also result in a better user experience one catch is the potentially long delay while the failover happens.p  pAny arguments one way or the other would be appreciated.  If you use the second approach, do you have a standard wrapper that helps simplify implementation  Either way, how do you structure your code to avoid issues such as those related to the lack of idempotency in the command that failedp

The implementation of Except does not work on the basis that the numbers in either collection will be strictly ascending or descending, so it first tries to gather all the values from the second collection into a set or similar, and only after that will it start enumerating the first collection.p  pAssuming that the function above is just a Whileloop that doesnt terminate unless you explicitly stop enumerating it, the above code will fail with a outofmemory exception.p  pBut, given that I have collections that are considered to be strictly ascending, or descending, are there any implementations already in .NET 4.0 that can dop  ol liGive me all values common to both inner joinli liGive me all values of both unionouter joinli liGive me all values in sequence 1 that isnt in sequence 2li ol  pI need this type of functionality related to a scheduling system I need to build, where I need to do things likep  pre c1  the 1st and 15th of every month from january 2010 and onwards c2  weekdays from 2010 and onwards c3  all days in 20102012 c4  c1 and c2 and c3 pre  pThis would basically give me every 1st and 15th of every month in 2010 through 2012, but only when those dates fall on weekdays.p  pWith such functions it would be much easier to generate the values in question without explicitly having to build collections out of them. In the above example, building the first two collections would need to know the constraint of the third collection, and the examples can become much more complex than the above.p

Negative 881 pIm sorry if this question is a dumb one, but I must ask. In PHP, we can create a array without declaring it first, althought it isnt considered good pratice.

To do this, I started a loop to put them in differents arrays based on their extensions. Like thisp  precodefilesbyext   edited  my bad, it was supposed to be  filesbyext[css]  [file.css,file2.css,file3.css] filesbyext[html]  [file.html,file2.html,file3.html] codepre  pThen I would sort using the keys css and html. But in the process to create the array of X files, I needed to verify if the key X existed. I couldnt simply push the fileeg. file.X.p  pThere is a way to create methods to alter this behavior, so that I can create a array pushing a item without declaring it firstp  precodefiles.each do f  extension  ...matchf[1].tos  filesbyext[extension] ltlt f end codepre  pAnd notthats what Im doingp  precodefiles.each do f  extension  ...matchf[1].tos  if filesbyext.keyextension   filesbyext[extension]  [f]  else   filesbyext[extension] ltlt f  end end codepre  pIm sorry, I think I wrote too much.

Its the part in bold that Id like to talk about.p  pEssentially what this problem boils down to is that I need to persist an object graph to an OLTP database and be able to query it temporally.p  pIn the simple case of one table this problem is very simple, you have a date range indicating the valid time span for the record and then you pass in an as of range and only select rows that are valid for this point in time.  The issues rise when you have more than one table.p  pLets take the case of having two tables, OrderItem.p  pWhen we query for an order we can apply the same as of date changes to the item table.  All is well, but what happens if we want to modify an order  Now we need to copy the order row, set the date ranges so the valid from on the new row and the valid to on the new row is set to now.  We also have to copy the items, or if we change our model copy the references to the items.p  pEven in this simple case things are starting to get complicated.p  pMy problem is exacerbated because I have a selfreferential object graph, so to use the above model youd have OrderItemOrder.p  pWhat would you do  How do you structure your databases when you need versioning of rows and temporal queriesp

Is there any product of the likes of DevExpress for Windows controls that can be added on to SSRS to solve these issuesp  pThank you.p

Negative 881 pGiven a collection of N1dimensional real valued vectors with N independent and 1 dependent value, I would like to compute a polynomial of degree 1 linear, 2 quadratic or higher that provides a reasonably good fit e.g. as determined by least squares error. In other words, when applied to the elements of the collection, the polynomial should map the independent values of each one to the associated dependent value with some reasonable margin of error.p  pI expect the dimensionality of the independent variables to be in the range 2..8, and to work on collections of 20..200 elements.

Negative 881 pIve been writing a backup program using VSS and started out with VSHADOW.EXE from the Windows SDK 6.1 Samples.

Negative 881 pIm just curious about this matter. So this question wont be a serious one p  pThis morning, when I was building this wiki app where I could keep all articles, I made a model called strongArticlestrong. I tested the strongarticlesnewstrong page with a form, and it worked. p  pBut, later, when I was polishing articlesindex page, I accidentally clear the file name strongarticle.rbstrong, and manually retyped that name. However, when I tried to run index page, it resulted in error, saying that strongArticle constant is not initialized in articlescontrollerstrong. The strongarticlesnewstrong page was unable to open due to the same error as well.p  pI guess Rails really can catch me doing stupid things... Anyway to fix this Other than rebuild the model and migration Thats what I did to fix the bug. Cumbersome though.p
Negative 881 pA common occurrence when rolling out the next version of a software package is that some of the data structures change.

However, everything Ive done so far seems a bit hairy to maintain or has other shortcomings. p  pIn a magical world Id be able to specify the desired schema definition, and have something automatically sort out what alters, updates, etc. are needed to move from the existing database layout... p  pWhat modern methodologiespracticespatterns exist for rolling out table definition changes with software updates  Do any MySql specific toolsscriptscommands exist for this kind of thingp

Negative 881 pIve been researching for days and Ive gotten to the point where my WCF service creates an Access object via cominterop.

If the codeCurrentDBcode is nothing then I surely cant call codeApplication.Run myFunctioncode  I realize WCF services arent meant to be user interactive, but its a long story why Im trying to go this route.  Basically I need to have a proof of concept ready sooner rather than later and the alternative correct route involves the complete rewriting of a large complex access VBA application.  Its not a permissions issue, I have the IIS user names added to the security tab.  What I really need is a way to set codeEnvironment.UserInteractivecode to true so my WCF service can create an instance of Access on my server machine, run the VBA functions, close out, return true.  Im using VS 2010 for the WCF, IIS 7 for my server, Access 2010 for the VBA application. Please helpp

Negative 881 pI am trying to add a text file to a zip archive through a Java program on Linux. The program spawns a process using java.lang.Process to execute the commandline zip j .zip .txt, reads the output and error streams of the spawned process and waits for the process to complete using waitFor. Though the program seems to run fine spawned process exits with exit code 0, indicating that the zip commandline was executed successfully and the output read from output and error streams do not indicate any errors, at the end of the program the zip archive doesnt always contain the file supposed to have been added. This problem doesnt happen consistently though even with the same existingarchive and filetoadd  once in a while perhaps once in 4 attempts the zip is found to have been updated correctly. Strangely, the problem doesnt occur at all when the program is run through Eclipse debugger mode. Any pointers on why this problem occurs and how it can be addressed would be helpful.

Negative 881 pI have a number of threads 100s that each execute for a few seconds at a time.  When they are executing, they spend a significant amount of that time waiting for a response from another system a serial device.  I am mindful that having 100 threads executing at once could be a resource hog so I actually limit the number of threads that can start at any one time.p  pIt occurs to me though that there must be good and bad ways of waiting for an external event inside a thread.  Is this approach CPUintensivep  precodesend command  repeat until response arrived  process response      codepre  pand does this approach make it more efficientp  precodesend command  repeat     Sleep 20  until response arrived  process response    codepre  pstrong ADDITIONAL INFO strongp  pThe environment is x86 Windows XP.  The thread code is a long and involved series of interactions with a serial device but in general, it consists of writing characters to a COM port using the AsyncFree serial library and waiting for characters to be returned by camping on the incoming characters buffer and processing them when they arrive.  I imagine the serial library makes device reads and writes. The time in the thread can be as long as a minute , or as short as a couple of seconds, but most of that time is spent waiting for characters to leave the port, or waiting for the response characters baud rate is slow, hence my question about the best way for the thread to behave while it is waiting.  Currently I am calling codeSleepcode in a loop waiting for codeCharactersInBuffercode to become nonzero, processing each character when it arrives, and exiting the thread when I have the complete response.  So the code looks more like ignoring handling of timeouts, etcp  precodesend command  Packet    repeat      repeat         Sleep 20      until response character arrived      build Packet  until complete packet arrived process response    codepre

Negative 881 pI have a WCF 4.0 REST service.  If I enable codeautomaticFormatSelectionEnabledcode in the codeweb.configcode file then the service will correctly choose between serializing as XML or JSON based on the HTTP Accept header.p  pHowever, when I issue the GET command with a browser, the response body comes back formatted as XML, but the HTTP contenttype header is texthtml.

Negative 881 pIm working on kind of an educational site, where there are teachers and students around the world potentially. Since its a nonprofit site, and I dont have the need for it to be done tomorrow kind of a side project of something bigger, I wanted to know the best way to figure out how to do this. Im not a programmer by trade, Ive been on the systems side of things for years, but I understand most technology and the question here is more how to gauge what to do so I can get the right resources in place.p  pThat said... heres what I am looking at. I figure the future is HTML5, and thats probably where Id rather spend my efforts given that it will be cross platform and without the need for plugins. It will work on mobile as well. Question is, how well does HTML5 handle input media, say desktop capture and camera, or on mobile perhaps, where Id want to use the users phone camera, etc.p  pSecond question is dynamic streaming... Ive read about MPEG DASH, then there are technologies like Smooth Streaming which I think given the way Silverlight is going is going to be gone or useless, then also Apple and Flash, but if Im doing HTML5 it doesnt benefit me. Any ideas here would be really helpful, and the more detail the better p  pThats about it... there are free chat services out there like using the MSN Web Chat controls how good they are, I dont know, but worldwide most people have a HotmailMSN account so I can use that for chat. I dont know its limitations of course, but thats something if people know or have suggestions, then Im all ears.p

As per various references about cxacallunexpected, the stacktrace depicts the typical behaviour of compiler to abort when exception is raised in a function with throw spec. Am I right with the analysis of the problemp  pTo test, I added a try catch in this method, and printed the exception message. Now the process didnt core. The exception message was same as the one caught by worker thread.  My question is, how does this thread get access to the exception caught by the other Do they share some datastructure related to exception handlingp  pPlease throw some light on this. It is quite puzzling..p  pNote As per stacktrace, the callunexpected is raised immediately after run is called. That strengthens my doubt that somehow exception stack or data is shared. But didnt find any references to this behaviour.p
Negative 881 pIm writing a simple codeHashMapcodebased Cache that works as followsp  ol liIf the requested codekeycode strongisstrong in cache, return its codevaluecode.li liIf the requested codekeycode strongis notstrong there, run a method that produces codevaluecode based on codekeycode, store both, return codevaluecode.li ol  pThe codep  precodeimport java.util.HashMap  abstract class CacheltK, Vgt extends HashMapltK, Vgt        Override     public V getObject key          if containsKeykey              return super.getkey          else              V val  getDatakey             putKkey, val     this is the line Im discussing below             return val                    public abstract V getDataObject key  codepre  pIts pretty straightforward and works well. However, I emhateem the Suns decision for codegetcode to take an codeObjectcode as its argument and not codeKcode. Ive read enough about it to know that it has some rationale behind it with which I dont agree, but thats another story.p  pMy problem is in the commented line, because it seems that the cast emhasem to be unchecked. Due to type erasure, theres no way I can check whether codekeycode is of type codeKcode which is needed for proper codeputcode functionality and the method is, therefore, error prone.p  pOne solution would be to switch from is a to has a codeHashMapcode relationship which is much nicer and clean, but then codeCachecode cant implement codeMapcode which would be nice for several reasons. The codep  precodeimport java.util.HashMap import java.util.Map  abstract class CacheltK, Vgt      private final MapltK, Vgt map  new HashMapltK, Vgt      public V getK key          if map.containsKeykey              return map.getkey          else              V val  getDatakey             map.putkey, val             return val                    public abstract V getDataK key  codepre  pCan anyone come up with any other even hackish solution, so that I could maintain codeCachecode to be a codeMapcode and still be type safe in the terms of codegetObject keycode and codeputK key, V valcodep  pThe only thing I can think of is to make another method named i.e. codegetValueKey kcode that would delegate to codegetObject keycode, but then I cant force anyone to use the new method instead of the usual one.p

However, I recently had to move the website to a server that uses RSA twofactor authentication, pin and token code for authenticating users in order to gain access to the site. And what Im seeing now is that all my jQuery posts are returning 405 error. p  pCrosssite requests comes to mind, obviously, but none of that is going on here. All of the jQuery AJAX posts are using web methods that are declared in the AjaxWebMethods.aspx, which page resides in the sites own domain.p  pThanks in advance for any help or suggestionsp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pUsing Fiddler in IE8 gives me a little more information. The error code that it returns is still 405, but the server error is more descriptive. The server error is The HTTP verb POST used to access path AjaxWebMethods.aspxUpdNote is not allowed.p  pI did try changing the type parameter of the ajax request to GET, but I get a 404 instead The resource cannot be found.p  pAlso, forgot to mention that this is over SSL although I dont expect this would make a difference.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAfter extensive testing and extensive help from the astute members of stackoverflow Ive determined that 405 error is directly related to the Application Pool that the website is using, and more specifically to the Managed Pipeline Mode that is selected for the Application Pool. p  pIf I use an Application Pool that targets v4.0 .NET Framework and Integrated Managed Pipeline Mode then my AJAX post works just fine. But if I use an Application Pool that targets v4.0 and Classic Managed Pipeline Mode then I get the 405 error.p  pSo at this point Im still looking for a solution to this question, although Ive been able to homein on the problem. p

Negative 881 pIm following a a hrefhttpddewaele.blogspot.in201105introducinggoogleplacesapi.html relnofollowsamplea to learn about the googleapijavaclient library. Ive downloaded the jars and added them to my libs folder, in my project. During compile time, there are no errors, but when I run the project, I get this error messagep  precodeDx trouble processing javaxtransactionHeuristicCommitException.class Illadvised or mistaken usage of a core class java. or javax. when not building a core library.  This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file in your applications project, when using an IDE such as Eclipse. If you are sure youre not intentionally defining a core class, then this is the most likely explanation of whats going on.  However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable legality.  If you really intend to build a core library  which is only appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution, as opposed to compiling an application  then use the corelibrary option to suppress this error message.  If you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact building an application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this problem.  If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation.

Negative 881 pGood evening,p  pIm working on a mobile augmented reality game and I wanted to use QR codes as a part of the game. What I wanted to do was to create QR codes myself which serve the purpose of passkeys in order to be able to proceed to the next stages of the game. So in that sense, I need users to be able to scan a QR code from a location out in the streets and if the QR code is the appropriate one, the application will proceed to the next activity in order to continue with the flow of the game.p  pI have in general checked the ZXing libraries but could not figure out exactly if I can use QR codes in this manner, so I decided to ask here if anyone has worked on  done anything similar.

Or maybe they want to participate in that kill fullblown desktop apps movement p  pSo is there a model for a desktop app developped in whatever GUI toolkit, that wants to have some minimal integration with a small HTMLCSSJS frontend in modern ui, like for e.g providing a dashboard of favorite or recently accessed files, contacts, etc p

Negative 881 pI recently began using PubNub in my iOS app, and am very happy with it. However, I have been looking at the other options available, such as Pusher and Realtime.co, which use Websockets. PubNub, on the other hand, uses long polling. I have done my own little speed comparisons and for my purposes, I find that they are all fast enough.p  pPubNub offers some nice features like message history and a list of everyone in the channel , so barring everything else I am leaning toward them. My question is, should I be concerned with battery life and heavy usage with a longpolling solution like PubNub Would a Websockets solution be significantly more power efficientp

Negative 881 pWe have a class codeDocumentcode which uses a private member of type codeMapltString, Objectgtcode as storage. Objects of this type are kept in memory and are very frequently modified by potentially multiple threads. It also happens that these objects or, specifically the underlying Maps are serialized out over HTTP on request. The serialization format is Json, and the library in use is currently Googles codeGsoncodep  pWhen serialization occurs simultaneously as a modification that introduces a new codeMap.Entrycode we see codeConcurrentModificationExceptionscode. This makes a lot of sense intuitively, since Gson is probably iterating over the codeentrySetcode which is being modified. p  pHow can we avoid this Do we need to resort to always passing a deep copy of the Map to Gson In that case, how would you implement said deep copy, given that the map can contain all Json primitives, including codeListcode and codeMapcodep

Negative 881 pemThis is all refactorable, so if theres a better way to approach the situation overall, let me know. This got wordy really quick, sorry.emp  hr  pIm creating a movie database, and Ive got 3 tables, codeMoviescode, codeGenrescode and codeMovieToGenrecode. Ive created the codeGenrecode table, and to populate the codeMtGcode table, Im trying to associate a codegenreidcode with a codemovieidcode, which is a onetomany relationship, I think, so itll have something like the following in itp  precodemovieid  genreid 1    56 1    786 2    232 2    656 codepre  pBut my issue is that in order to fill that table, I need the codemovieidcode from the codeMoviecode model. I assumed that  once Ive added the codeMoviecode to the codeMoviescode table, that the model would retroactively update its codemovieidcode property, but that doesnt seem to be the case, as the codeMovieToGenrecode table gets populated with codemovieidcodes  equalling 0, the default value.  The codeMoviescode table is using the proper codemovieidcode so its a matter of telling my codeFillMovieToGenrecode method which movie has what codemovieidcode.p  pThe general process Im using is the following loopp  ol lipCreate codeMoviecode instance, not setting the codemovieidcode, since MVC chooses one itselfp  pa. codemovie  new Moviedata1, data2codepli lipAdd codeMoviecode instance to table p  pa.  codedb.Movies.Addmoviecodepli lipUse the last codeMoviecode instances codemovieidcode  in a codeFillMovieToGenreTablecode method.p  pa. codeFillMtGTablemoviecode But at this point, the movie does not contain the nondefault codemovieidcode and so the codeMtGcode table is filled with codemovieid  0code, where it should be codemovieid  1231code etc.pli lipGOTO 1.pli ol  pstrongtldr Possible to get a primary key for a recently added model Seems like making a new query would be a bad idea, since Im looping over all the movies I need to add, and that new query would slow the process down, Id think.strongp  pedited in the relevant parts of the codeMoviecode classp  precodepublic class Movie      [Key]     public int movieID  get set       [DisplayNameTitle]     public string title  get set     public class Genre      [DisplayNameGenre ID]     [Key]     [DatabaseGeneratedDatabaseGeneratedOption.None]     public int genreID  get set       [DisplayNameGenre]     public string genrestring  get set    public class MovieToGenre   [Key]     public int movietogenreID  get set       public virtual int movieID  get set       public virtual int genreID  get set   codepre

Negative 881 pWhen using PayPal Advanced, the API allows the creation of a subscription profile by converting a single payment using PNREF as ORIGID. We are testing this using the embedded IFRAME to capture CC information. Sandbox amp Test Accounts. Now, in the PayflowPro Recurring billing API  December 2012 documentation the MODIFY action is explained.  We have tested this MODIFY action for most subscription parameters.br How can we update the PAYMENT information, say user wants to use a diff CC, for whatever reason.  Since the original info was captured by PP using the embedded IFRAME, we do not keep payment info onrecord at our system. One reason to use PPAdvanced is so we do NOT have to capture sensitive info on OUR servers.  The MODIFY action NVP supports the direct update of sensitive CC information.  This kinda defeats the purpose of using PayPal Advanced.p  pQUESTION  How do we update using the API the payment info for an existing subscription profile that was converted using the conversion method.

Negative 881 pstrongQuestion what are the risksconcernsissues with exposing a SQL Server Stored Procedure as a web service end pointstrongp  pSome context. We have p  ul lia SQL Server 2005 database which is used to log transactions.  Theres a Stored Proc for adding transaction records.li liA java EE app that needs to write transaction recordsli liAn Enterprise Integration Bus a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSAPNetWeaverProcessIntegration relnofollowSAP PIa, and an architectural policy that states it should be used for all integration calls.li ul  pWe can easily expose a web service from PI that the java app can consume.  However calling a stored proc from PI isnt easy at least our integration team has no experience in doing so.p  pAn alternative would be to expose the stored proc as a web service directly from the DB.  The java app would still call the PI service, which would in turn call the SQL Server web service, which would call the stored proc.  A bit round the houses perhaps but its not high volume or timecritical so dont expect it to cause performance problems.p  pThe organisation doesnt have any experience with using SQL Server WS end points.  So theres a certain nervousness around implications, notably  but not exclusively  security.  Note this is specifically any concerns over and above the usual considerations for securing access to the DB.p  pAny advicealternative suggestions appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 881 pUsing the answer from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma15553973406677a previous questiona, I made an infinite scroll. However, I have a problem when scrolling. p  pIt seems that for a millisecond, the codeUICollectionViewcode or maybe the codeUIScrollViewcode for that matter thinks the cells shown are not visible anymore, thus reuses the cells for new cells. This leads to cells being double used when scrolling. The reason I believe this is the cause of my problem is because the cheat one uses in order to be able to infinite scroll is to reset the codecontentOffsetcode of the codeUIScollViewcode.p  pThe cells of my codeUICollectionViewcode contain a background image which is downloaded asynchronously of fetched from cache using codeMKNetworkKitcode. One of the other side effects is that when scrolling a view screen lenghts in a row, the screen gets truncated. Almost as if a reloadData occurred in the codeUIScrollViewcode, yet the code doesnt reload the data at all.p  pMy question is How can I prevent the codeUICollectionViewcode from reusing visible cells and from truncating the view suddenlyp

Negative 881 pNormally, comparators are the best option when you want to compare objects using different attributes see for example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions369512bestwaytocompareobjectsbymultiplefieldsBest way to compare objects by multiple fieldsa. However, in my particular case Im not sure about using comparators.p  pThe problem is the following I have defined a generic interface, called codeNodeltSgtcode, which is shared by different components. There is also a codeCostNodeltSgtcode which extends the codeNodeltSgtcode, and a codeScoreNodeltSgtcode which extends codeCostNodeltSgtcodep  precodepublic interface NodeltSgt      S getS      more methods...   public interface CostNodeltSgt extends NodeltSgt       This method smells really bad     int compareByCostComparableNodeltSgt node   public interface ScoreNodeltSgt extends CostNodeltSgt       int compareByCostCostNodeltSgt node from CostNodeltSgt     int compareByScoreScoreNodeltSgt node  codepre  pAt this point, someone can argue You dont need CostNode and ScoreNode, you can use different comparators to compare nodes. Thats ok. But the problem comes nowp  pI have a component, called Client, which uses ScoreNodes. Client requires a node factory, provided by the user, which is responsible of creating ScoreNodesp  precodepublic class Client       ...      public ClientNodeFactoryltS, ScoreNodeltSgtgt nodeFactory...      public void process           while...             S current  get             S old  getOld              ...             ScoreNodeltSgt next  this.nodeFactory.createcurrent,...              Comparisons performed             if next.compareByCostold lt0                 ...                          if next.compareByScoreold gt 0                 ...                                 codepre  pAs you can see, the behavior of comparing nodes is embedded into the nodes, and is closely related to the factory used different nodes requires a different factory  and different comparators. p  pOn the other hand, if I use comparators, I have to provide to the Client three components CostComparator, ScoreComparator and a NodeFactory. In this scenario, I can use only codeNodeltSgtcode and forget about codeCostNodeltSgtcode and codeScoreNodeltSgtcodep  precodepublic class ConcreteNodeCostComparator implements ComparatorltNodeltSgtgt      public int compareNodeltSgt a, NodeltSgt b         return Double.compareConcreteNodeltSgta.getCost, ConcreteNodeltSgtb.getCost         public class ConcreteNodeScoreComparator implements ComparatorltNodeltSgtgt      public int compareNodeltSgt a, NodeltSgt b         return Double.compareConcreteNodeltSgta.getScore, ConcreteNodeltSgtb.getScore        codepre  pHowever, I dont really like this alternative, because in this case I have to provide two more components to Client, when the comparison methods strongly depends on the nodes.p  pI think Im missing something in this design. What do you think aboutp

Negative 881 pI have a lookup table of Scientific Names for plants. I want to use this lookup table to validate other tables where I have a data entry person entering the data. Sometimes they get the formatting of these scientific names wrong, so I am writing a script to try to flag the errors. p  pTheres a very specific way to format each name. For example Sonchus arvensis L. specifically needs to have the S in Sonchus capitalized as well as the L at the end. I have about 1000 different plants and each one is formatted differently. Heres a few more examplesp  ul liLinaria dalmatica L. Mill.li liKnautia arvensis L. Coult.li liAlliaria petiolata M. Bieb. Cavara amp Grandeli liBerteroa incana L. DC.li liAegilops cylindrica Hostli ul  pAs you can see, all of these strings are formatted very differently i.e some letters are capitalized, some arent, there are brackets sometimes, ampersands, periods, etcp  pMy question is, is there any way to dynamically read the formatting of each string in the lookup table so that I can compare that to the value the data entry person entered to make sure it is formatted properly In the script below, I test first elif to see if the value is in the lookup table by capitalizing all values in order to make the match work, regardless of formatting. In the next test second elif I can sort of test formatting by comparing against the lookup table value for value. This will return unmatched records based on formatting, but it doesnt specifically tell you why the unmatched record returned.p  pWhat I perceive to do is, read in the string values in the look up table and somehow dynamically read the formatting of each string, so that I can specifically identify the error i.e. a letter should be capitalized, where it wasntp  pSo far my code snippet looks like thisp  precode         Determine if the field heaidng is in a list I built earlier         if SCIENTIFICNAME in fieldnames              First, Test to see if record is empty             if not row.SCIENTIFICNAME                 weedPLineErrors.appendSCIENTIFICNAME record is empty              Second, Test to see if value is in the lookup table, regardless of formatting.             elif row.SCIENTIFICNAME.upper not in [x.upper for x in weedScientificTableList]                 weedPLineErrors.appendCOMMONNAME   row.SCIENTIFICNAME     is not in the domain table              Third, if the second test is satisfied, we know the value is in the lookup table. We can then test the lookup table again, without capitalizing everything to see if there is an exact match to account for formatting.             elif row.SCIENTIFICNAME not in weedScientificTableList                 weedPLineErrors.appendCOMMONNAME   row.SCIENTIFICNAME     is not formatted properly                                     else                 pass codepre  pI hope my question is clear enough. I looked at string templates, but I dont think it does what I want to do...at least not dynamically. If anyone can point me in a better direction, I am all eyes...but maybe I am way out to lunch on this one.p  pThanks, Mikep

Negative 881 pIm writing a networking application which receives data from multiple clients when a packet is received, the application reads and modifies the header, and then forwards the packet to one or more clients. I thought to use an output queue for each connection to a client, so the application is able to monitor the filling level of each output queue and detect the load on each client.p  pThe routing of incoming packets could be achieved by a single thread, which should analyze the header of each packet in order to determine the destination client this thread also accesses to a routing table in order to forward packets correctly.p  pHow to handle incoming messages I could use a single shared queue or one input queue for each connectionp  ol liif I use ema single shared queueem, it would be concurrently accessed by the routing thread and by the threads that handle the connections with clients li liif I use emone input queue for each input connectionem, it would be concurrently accessed by the routing thread and by the only thread which handles that connection from the client.li ol  pIn the first case, the role of routing thread would be rather simple, since it should only dequeue the next packet from the queue and forward it to another client. In the second case, instead, the routing thread should check, one by one, all the input queues. This second approach could have the advantage of avoiding the fastest connections can fill the shared queue, thus increasing the probability that the other connections can find the queue full.p  pThe second approach would require that the routing thread should follow a policy that ensures a fair behavior in relation to the input queues. What policy could be used in this casep  pMoreover, what other reasons might lead one to choose the first or the second solution What are advantages and disadvantages for both solutionsp

Negative 881 pI realize that the purpose of SVN is to store structured files for an application or for some other purpose that have standard names, and updates to these files are committed, becoming revisions.p  pWe know that files in SVN are typically environment agnostic.  Im defining environment as DEV, QA, UAT and PROD.  Suppose we mix QA and UAT unstructured files into this, and want to keep track of QA scripts, QA automation scripts, screen shots, proposed documentation for defects that were fixed, business requirements for a piece of development, etc..  Essentially, we want a place to store these unstructured files.  Where in the structure below would we store such a thing, or is this not recommendedp  pSince branches are smaller project work or task work within a larger project or application, we store pieces of development within a branch subfolder.  Trunk is a stable version of whats in production, right  In the past, Ive heard that tags is where deployment and rollback scripts should live, and anything at some point in the past, that is more or less static.  So Im thinking we either put these unstructured files in branches or tags.  p  pThe reason I say unstructured is because we may have QA screen shots that may be different for each piece of development and might become obsolete later on.  We obviously dont want to check these back into trunk after development, but during development, a screen shot may change as new development changes get checked into a branch before that branch is actually stable, so we may want to overwrite that screen shot with the newer screen shot.  Also, test scripts will change as development changes.  We also have business requirements for development, test plans for DEV and for QA, test results for DEV and QA, descriptions of defects found before development, and descriptions of fixes for defect development, etc...p  pHere is the structure we currently havep  precodeapp apptrunk apptrunkfilex appbranches appbranchesYYYYMMDDbranchxfilex apptags codepre

Negative 881 pI needed to find a safe bool idiom solution. You know the drill, Im using VS 2012, XCode, GCC, LLVM, various platforms, some support the C11 explicit conversion operator and some dont. I needed something portable.p  pI found several, but devised that seems so simple that I have to ask, am I missing something herep  pstrongBackground briefstrongp  pSeveral examples one the web provide either highly intrusive methods essentially putting everything required inside a given class, or a generic approach using CRTP, but most are based on a pointer to member function which is of wildly unpredictable size and performance penalty.p  pThen I read about codeboostspiritclassiccode safe bool, tried it, examined it, etc. What I liked about spirits implementation was that it depended upon a pointer to member data rather than a pointer to member function with a compiler workaround for obscure versions.p  pSo I thought, it really doesnt matter what the type the pointer to member is based upon, the implementations are working because, among other things, these are pointers to members of anything other than objects were likely to use.p  pSo, I tried this kind of thing and Im wondering if Im way off or ok with thisp  pFirstp  precodeclass SafeBool   private  SafeBool  Value 0      public   int Value  codepre  pcodeSafeBoolcode takes the job of codeboostspiritcodes safebool template without imposing the burden of driving user classes from it.p  precode pointer to member typedef, made widely available  typedef int SafeBool    safebool    more about why this define in a moment define EXPLICITOPERATORBOOL operator safebool    here is an example user class, some smart pointer or something  templatelt typename T gt class SomeSPtr    public  ... other class stuff, obviously   EXPLICITOPERATORBOOL const        if  get  return ampSafeBoolValue           return 0          codepre  pFirst, codeEXPLICITOPERATORBOOLcode is a define which can be switched on C11 compliant compilers to use the real explicit operator bool, whereas on VS 2012 and old GCC or what have you, it can be as it is here, conversion to operator safebool.p  pOne can even use a related define for the return...sayp  precodeSAFEBOOLRETURN get  codepre  pWhich could modulate the return logic to essentially make the code switchable between modern and older compilers that is, for C11 the define would resolve to return codeget  0codep  pNow, this had the same basic results on VS 2012 as spirits code.

Negative 881 pwas looking for a solution to this but couldnt find a good explanation.p  pI currently have code that returns an array for each iteration into a row of a spreadsheet. On the last iteration it take all the row data and copies and pastes it to another sheet. I know it would be a million times faster if I could just make one huge array with each item being a array of data and then transpose it without ever copying and pasting  manipulating cells at all.p  pHow can I do this The bigger issue for me is also that each major iteration is based off a global variable and is not a loop within the sub itself. This is because the sheet data that is used for making the array for each iteration requires time to load into the sheet.p  pHere is the code for my sub.

This works fine.p  pThe text contains of a few articles, every article has a few paragraphs and some paragraphs contain HTMLlike formatting. p  pThe part Im unsure about is how to get this text in my view I tried setting the codeXamlcode property of a codeRichTextBoxcode but then my text files should contain proper codeXAMLcode. Id rather not go this way.p  pAnother aproach I took was adding the paragraphs as codeTextBlockcode to a codeStackPanelcode. Didnt seem right either.p  pSo, any suggestions how to tackle this Maybe store it as proper XHTML and then transform it to XAML an inject in a codeRichTextBoxcodep  pstrongEDITstrong The app presents the articles on a pivot control.p

Negative 881 pIt has come to the point in my program now where I have 5 swinging pendulums that are all modified at once by slider values. These values are drawn onto the from and passed through the class pendulum. To change the values the update button is run, and their is a default option to use a setup that works. The values are also shown on screen through some simple labels. The zero button sets all values except length to zero. brp  pNow my next task is to make the pendulums collide realistically and recreate a newtons cradle type effect. Ive looked into elastic collision solutions on particle e.g. here is an excellent example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions345838balltoballcollisiondetectionandhandlingBall to Ball Collision  Detection and Handlinga brp  pIve also looked at the raw physics behind it a hrefhttpanswers.yahoo.comquestionindexqid20120220223430AAxVQHt relnofollowherea but my brain couldnt get to grips with the raw physics side of things.p  pSo Im wondering if anybody could help me figuring out the theory for the collisions. br My current idea is when the coordinates meet the velocity will simply change polarity e.g. 10 to 10 in the opposing pendulum.

Negative 881 pI have a long piece of code in java which uses selenium webdriver and firefox to test my website. Pardon me if I cant reproduce it here. It has an infinite while loop to keep doing its function repeatedly. Thats what its supposed to do. Also, I dont use multi threading.p  ol lipSometimes, it gets stuck. I use a windows system and the code runs on command prompt. When it  gets stuck, no errors or exceptions are thrown. Its something like it hangs only the window in which the code runs hangs. Then I have to use CTRL  C . Sometimes it resumes working after that, other times it gets terminated and I restart it. It works fine but after some loops it hangs again. Also, Ive noticed that its usually during the execution of one of the methods querying mysql database.pli lipThe code runs an infinite loop. Each time, it queries the mysql database, fetches a valuewhose status field is not done from a particular table  one value in each loop and proceeds with testing with this value.At the end of the loop, the table is updated the column status is set to done for that value. When there are no new values having status not equal to done in that particular table, it should ideally display NO NEW VALUE. However, after all the values have been used, it simply takes up the last used value even though its status is updated to done at the end of previous loop and goes ahead. I then have to terminate the execution and run the code again. This time when the infinite loop begins, it queries the database and correctly displays NO NEW VALUE, queries again, displays the message again and so onwhich is what it should dopli ol  pI close the sql connection using con.close.p  pIt appears that after running the loop for a few times, some resource is getting exhausted somewhere.

Negative 881 pI came across a very tricky problem today. I am parsing an codeXMLcode document using codeXSLT 1.0code. The codeXMLcode provides me the the HEX color codes and then some manipulation instructions on the luminance and shade of the color. I need to generate a final color value preferably in HEX or RGB values but HSL will also do.p  pNow to apply those manipulations I need to convert my HEX color values into HSL.  It would be really great if it can be done directly form the XSL otherwise I might have reparse the output of the XSL and do the conversion from Javascript I would like to avoid this roundabout way coz its not very efficient. In either case I need a formula for the conversion. I came across a hrefhttpwww.rapidtables.comconvertcolorrgbtohsl.htm relnofollowthis conversion formulaa but it seems too complicated for codeXSLTcode and anyways its an RGB to HSL conversion formula.p  pCan anyone help me with this conversionp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 881 pIm looking for the best approach to my problemp  pI have a bayesian model class that you can call codeclassifycode on. I want as many threads to access this as possible. However, I have another method that would alter the internal structure of the object coderemoveCategorycode.p  pIs it possible for me to prevent threads from accessing codeclassifycode only while coderemoveCategorycode is being accessedp  pI think I might achieve this with a semaphore, where codeclassifycode acquires 1 permit per thread, while coderemoveCategorycode acquires max permits. That way itll block til all threads are done with codeclassifycode, and another thread cannot start a codeclassifycode call until the permits have been released.p  pIs there a better solutionp
Negative 881 pI have many Excel workbooks in the same shared folder on a file server. In each workbook theres some data and an Update charts button that generates  updates charts inside the workbook based on the data.p  pThis is all implemented and works, but I have a maintenance problem... If I have to change or fix something in my macros, I have to update the macros in all workbooks.p  pI would prefer to have one additional workbook that contains nothing else, but my macros to generate  update the charts. All the other workbooks should call these macros when the button is pressed. That way, when I have to change the chart generation, I could do it in one place. The best would be if the users dont even have to open the macro workbook.p  pIs there a best practice  advice for that Can this be safely implemented at all provided that multiple users are simultaneously updating the workbooks and generating the charts using the Update charts buttonp  pThank you.p

But 1 of the time, for some reason not all of the records are getting copied over. Most recently for example I had 23,800 records in a table to copy over, but only 19,567 of them actually made it over to the other database.p  pWhatever is causing this issue, it seems much more likely to happen when I have thousands of records in a table, though I have had this problem occur when copying as few 43 records, only 15 of them made it over.p  pTheres no reliable way to duplicate this error, which is only making debugging it even more difficult. Even after this issue pops up, if I try doing the exact same steps 10 times I cant get it to happen again. Ive never gotten this error to occur when Im using break points so that I can investigate it closer.p  pNothing else in my code is even touching the databases, or connections to the databases while this code is run either. I havent had any luck searching the web, or looking very closely at my code for something that could be messing it up and causing records to be forgotten.p  pI know I didnt accidentally delete all the missing records when this occurs either, because if I look at the table that Im copying the records from, all the missing records are still there.p  pSo, bottom line, Im stumped, what could be causing this problemp  pstrongEditstrong I think Ive made some progress at figuring out how to duplicate this issue. It seems if I hover my mouse over the menu item that triggers this event, and click multiple times very rapidly on my mouse, this bug happens about 23s of the time.p  pNow Im even more baffled how this isnt causing my program to either crash or hit a catch in a try catch statement if attempting to run my click events multiple times is causing this issue.p

Negative 881 pI am experimenting with the implementation of Vertex Buffer Objects VBO as a way to render in 3D using openGL via the Lightweight Java Game Library LWJGL. My particular program allows every object with graphical representation to render and draw itself to the screen. My question is not about whether this rendering management is a good idea under which circumstances. I am rather interested in the drawing process of LWJGL itself. I have prepared to simple drawing methods of, let us say for example, a point cloudp  precodepublic void drawVBO          enable Vertex Arrays VBOs         glEnableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY           tell OpenGL to draw the data supplied by the pointer method          as points.length amount of points         glDrawArraysGLPOINTS, 0, points.length          otherwise use GLLINES, GLTRIANGLES, GLQUADS, etc.           httpwiki.delphigl.comindex.phpglDrawArrays           Disable Vertex Arrays VBOs         glDisableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY           public void drawVBOBound          enable Vertex Arrays VBOs         glEnableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY          tell OpenGL to use our VBO         glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, vertexBufferObject           tell OpenGL to draw the data supplied by the pointer method          as points.length amount of points         glDrawArraysGLPOINTS, 0, points.length          otherwise use GLLINES, GLTRIANGLES, GLQUADS, etc.           httpwiki.delphigl.comindex.phpglDrawArrays           Unbind the VBO         glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, 0          Disable Vertex Arrays VBOs         glDisableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY      codepre  pThe difference between those to is the binding and unbinding of the objects own VBO. In a scenario where I render and draw lots of different point cloud objects, I will have multiple vertex buffers bound. This indicates that I have to explicitly tell openGL which vertex buffer to use during the rendering process as seen in method codedrawVBOBoundcode. Otherwise openGL would draw every single bound vertex buffer by means of the current drawing object which equals multiple drawing during one renderindrawing cycle of the program nobody would want that. Is this assumption correctp

Negative 881 pI have a fairly simple problem. I have a container div with three children  two divs and a table.

When the page is rendered, the height of the parent container div is set to the height of the table, as it should. The other children, however, are being collapsed for some reason. Heres the example, with some table elements and styling for clarity a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netGUEc6 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netGUEc6a. As you see, the height of the container div is being properly set to the height of the table, but the child1 and child2 divs fail to properly set their heights to 100 of that. I know that if a floated element has its height set to 100, the parent element needs to have some definition of its own height so the child can be 100 of something concrete. But it doesnt look like thats whats happening here.p
Negative 881 pI am working on a layout override in Joomla 3 for a job application form. The component is using some Bootstrap already, but not for what I want right now.p  pThe problem I am running into, and not sure if I can solve without modifying the PHP itself, is with the ability to turn on and off different fields and have the layout respond.p  pSo... Right now its all done in tables, so lots of rows in here. I am trying to get rid of the table layout and change it into something that stacks nicely on mobile.p  pIm going to use the first couple of lines as an example. Both lines could possibly contain 3 columns, depending on what fields are being displayed.p  pFirst line asks for Name, Middle Name and Last Name. I currently have Middle Name turned off Second line asks for Phone, Mobile and Work phone numbers.p  pWhat I want to do is have that first line display Name and Last name as wide as it can in the space provided so it appears there are only two columns in the grid. However, if I am asked to put the Middle name field back in, I can simply turn it on and it will go back to three columns.p  pIs this possible with Bootstrap alone, or would this require setting up something like For example, Im not a programmer a series of ifelse statements that will change the grid based on the selection of fields.p  pHope this all makes sense. Let me know if I was unclear anywhere.p

Negative 881 pI have written a program in C that has several different versions of a certain function. I select which one to use based on hardware considerations and change the single call I make to this function before compiling. I usually go to the trouble of commenting out the unused functions as well. But Im wondering what effect leaving them uncommented would have.p  pIt seems to me that if they are never called they wont have any effect on execution time at all. But they will increase the size of the executable. Since the executable size is small anyway that doesnt bother me. The only thing that matters is execution time, and that is critical. So it seems that commenting out the unused functions isnt worth the trouble. Am I rightp

Does anyone have any idea whats going on with this p  pThanks for any help you all may be able to offer.p  p UPDATE p  pAnother thing to note is that Im using the STTwitter library to make the requests.

The part that actually displays the web view controller is not listed here. I wanted to keep the code snippet here focused on the actual API methods, and not the UI logic. Just be assured that the line right after authWebViewController.url.... displays the web view, and then the completion block is called after the user completes the authentication on the Twitter web page. Also the two methods getOauthTokenFromURL and getOauthVerifierFromUrl do in fact return the correct token and verifier. The STTwitter library actually saves out the token its self, so that is why its not manually passed into the logic below. The logic generates the request above.p  pThanksp

Negative 881 pIm facing a task of locating what is causing our production app to sporadically lock up its mainGUI thread on an endusers machine. Unfortunately the intermittent nature of this bug and the inability to install and run any debuggingtracking tools in that environment makes locating the cause way more difficult. The current approach is to try to place traces around possible locking APIs and see which one may be causing the lockup.p  pIn light of that Im curious, if theres a list of WinAPIs that call a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms64495028vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowSendMessagea or other locking WinAPI internally Which I believe may be a primary reason for deadlocks in the main thread.p  pPS.

Negative 881 pI have two UITableViewControllers, displaying events and objects. Both of them within the same navigationcontroller. Both of them contain Search Display Controllers.p  pWhen tapping an object, a push segue is performed to display the events view filtered by the object. After this segue, when tapping the search bar in the EventsViewController, the navigation bar slides up and hides.  When the searchbar loses focus, the navigation bar comes back down.p  pI realize the push segue automatically creates a new navigation bar. But how do I make sure the searchbar doesnt automatically hide the navbar It stays under the navigationbar as wished for until the push segue is performed.p  pI can post code if you want, but I doubt that would help in this case. Let me know.p

As soon as I cross the class boundaries, I receive the following messagep  pnonstatic method ... cannot be referenced from a static contentp  pFirst of all, I dont understand why the content is static if it isnt marked as static in the method signature, but maybe the ApiMethod annotation does its job here, because it is understandable that the API is exposed as a static method.p  pSecond, I would probably be able to get around this by using a delegate function, but then I would like to know if it is considered good practice to call into one of my own endpoints from another endpoint.p  pLet me know what you think, please.p

Negative 881 pMy current system runs on Linux, with the different tasks using shared memory to access the common data which is defined as a C struct. The size of the shared data is about 100K.p  pNow, I want to run the main user interface on Windows, while keeping all the other tasks in Linux, and Im looking for the best replacement for the shared memory. The refresh rate of the UI is about 10 times per second.p  pMy doubt is if its better to do it by myself or to use a third party solution. If I do it on my own, my idea is to open a socket and then use some sort of data serialization between the client Windows and the server Linux. p  pIn the case of third party solutions, Im a bit overwhelmed by the number of options. After some search, it seems to me that the right solution could be MPI, but I would like to consider other options before start working with it XDR, OpenMP, JSON, DBus, RDMA, memcached, boost libraries  Has anyone got any experience with any of them Which are the pros and cons of using such solutions for accessing the shared memory on Linux from Windowsp  pMaybe MPI or the other third party solutions are too elaborated for such a simple use as mine and I should use a doityourself approach Any advice if I take that solution Am I missing something Am I looking in the wrong direction I wouldnt like to reinvent the wheel.p  pFor the file sharing, Im considering Samba. p  pMy development is done with C and C, and, of course, the solution needs to be compiled in Linux and Windows.p

Negative 881 pI have an app that displays two codefragmentscode inside the codeMainActivitycode one codefragmentcode displays a simple codeGoogle Map API v2code and the other one displays 2D stuff drawn using codeOpenGL ES 2code. Both of these are quite simple things, not very resource consuming. p  pI currently tested the app only in the codeGenymotion Emulatorcode and I noticed a severe framerate drop whenever I move the map around or zoom it. If I dont do anything, the framerate is quite good 2030 fps. When I start moving the codemapcode, the framerate can drop all the way to 10. p  pI was wondering if I could use different threads for the codemapcode andor codeOpenGLcode but I dont know how or if that is even possible. Im not sure about the codemapcode, but I know that codeOpenGLcode already runs things in its own dedicated thread or so I read over the internet.p  pIs there a way to further optimise what I am doing Not necesarilly with threads. I didnt offer any code because both codefragmentscode work fine on their own and as I said they dont do much. I know I should also test my app on a real device but I currently dont have access to one and I am still curious if or how could I further optimise what I did.p

Negative 881 pSo if you have been in programming for some years you probably know that it is basic practice to use Relative Paths for every link in your website and Absolute Paths for link that will take the user to other pages.p  pBut if we now include the variable of velocity into our thoughts, we might start thinking that absolute paths should always be used, or not p  pIsnt it faster for a script to only verify if a link starts with Http that having to check all this possible Relative Paths first p  blockquote   p......page.phpp      p..page.phpp      p.page.phpp      ppage.phpp blockquote  pseems like a beginners question..p  pany ideas about this p  pstrongSo, what once was just mainly me wanting to discuss something that i was almost sure, became something that Im sure This link a hrefhttpsyoast.comrelativeurlsissues relnofollowhttpsyoast.comrelativeurlsissuesa is for the ones that will face the same problem as I am which is basically efficiency at its highest level.strongp

Negative 881 pI have a JBoss EWS Tomcat 7 Java application on openshift, installed with the MySQL 5.5 and PhpMyAdmin 4.0 cartridges. I have copied the repository locally, and deleted the source folder. Instead, I simply have a compiled Java application, a WAR file, that has been copied into the webapps directory and git pushed to the OpenShift servers.p  pIf I have some database, how would I be able to access it in the webapp compiled war file. Would standard MySQL JDBC work According to some posts I have read, OpenShift blocks the accessing of external requests to the database, and in this case, the webapp directorys war file may be making an external request. The source for that is here a hrefhttpswww.openshift.comforumsexpressexternalaccesstomysql relnofollowhttpswww.openshift.comforumsexpressexternalaccesstomysqla as answered by reputable OpenShift developers.p  pI actually tried JDBC in the past and it did not work, but that may have been due to incorrect code. If someone wants to write some code that shows how this would be done, I would appreciate it. And if you could test it that would be even nicer p  pBy the way, in the answer please do not include port forwarding. I know that works, I have tried it before, and port forwarding works. But it is often a little insecure, and has to be started each time from a computer.p

Negative 881 pIm making an openworld singleplayer RPG in which the world is composed of mostly isolated regions, which for scalability are divided into sections. The world contains beings that interact with each other. Most beings will have references to other beings, possibly including beings in other regions. A class definition for codebeingcode might look likep  precodeclass Being      weakptrltBeinggt target      other members  codepre  pOf course, I need to be able to save and load the game state to and from disk. Now, I dont want to have all beings loaded at all times. I only want to load those beings that are near the player or, at worst, all the beings in the currently loaded region. What is a good strategy to accomplish this Here are a couple of ideas Ive tossed around so far.p  ol liOn disk, beings will store a unique identifier for each referenced being. As being A is loaded, if referenced being B has already been loaded, the pointer is simply set. If B is unloaded, it must also be loaded. The downside is that this could recursively load a lot of beings that might not be used directly.li liInstead of beings containing actual pointers, theyll contain identifiers. Then as the referenced beings are used for instance, if a being needs to damage another target being, theyll be loaded only as needed. This complicates using the references and has the potential to cause more saveload operations, but it avoids loading unnecessary data.li ol  pAre there better alternatives to these options I imagine this is a common problem, but I havent been able to find related questions on SO.p

You cant even use a UITableViewController, youll need to   implement your view controller as a UIViewController. Then you add   your own table view as a subview. Youll also need to add your footer   as a subview of the view controllers view, not the table view. Make   sure you size the table view so its bottom is at the top of the footer   view.p blockquote  pbut the problem is that my UITextField, inside my footer, is being hidden by the keyboard when user tries to type.

MUCHstrong for taking a look at this code.  Any ideas, even ideas I may not have thought about that would be simple to implement are welcome.  If there is a freely available control that would work better, Im open to that, as well.  Even emTextBlocksem would be fine, but Im still stuck on how to get the emTextBlocksem filled with the proper data for a specific group.p  pBeing completely desperate and at the end of my rope, Im open to clunky, barbaric solutions as well, as long as they get the job done.  It doesnt have to be pretty  Also, this need is somewhat urgent, Im afraid, so even if you dont have time to put together a proper example, some pointers would be welcomep

The problem is that the contents inside the folder keep on changing dynamically and the idea of adding  codekCFURLIsExcludedFromBackupKeycode for every files sounds a bit difficult, as there are multiple classes in my code which can write to the documents directory.p  pIs there any way I can disable the upload of the entire documents folder and its subfolder.p

Negative 881 pSome shops e.g., some video game development teams disable support for exceptions in their build environment. With exceptions disabled, developers would have no reason to declare their move operations codenoexceptcode assuming that such code would even compile. But standard library implementations are supposed to call codestdmoveifnoexceptcode when implementing some operations e.g., codestdvectorpushbackcode. Do standard library implementations typically check during compilation to see if exceptions are disabled and, if so, use codestdmovecode instead of codestdmoveifnoexceptcode Do compilers cause codestdisnothrowmoveconstructiblecode to return true for all types when exceptions are disabled Or does disabling support for exceptions have the unexpected side effect of having codestdmoveifnoexceptcode fail to enable move operationsp  pIm interested in what happens in practice. I understand that disabling support for exceptions takes us out of the realm of the C standard.p

The results of that step would look likep  precode  id   base                  1   foobar          1   fooboo          2   alphabeta       2   alphadelic      3   plastikman codepre  pAnd the final result would reflect the number of unique tuple1  tuple2 values, per unique codeidcodep  precode  id   cnt       1   2    2   2    3   1 codepre  pI can achieve these results, but not without doing a subquery to get the results of the implicit step mentioned above, and then selectgrouping out of that.  Something likep  precodeSELECT   id,   countbase cnt FROM    SELECT     id,     substringindexuri, , 3 AS base   FROM thetable   GROUP BY id, base  GROUP BY id codepre  pMy reason for wanting to avoid the subquery is that Im working with a fairly large 20M rows data set, and the subquery gets very expensive.  Gut tells me its not doable, but figured Id ask SO...p

Negative 881 pIve looked around but couldnt find any solutions, so this is my last resort.p  pIm working on a XamarinAndroid project and Ive got a viewpager with one fragment. The trick with this fragment is that even though its only one fragment, it loads many instances of this one fragment, depending on how many I need but the problem is that each fragment needs to load one object one set of data. The problem I have is that when I iterate through the list of returned items loaded from a file, it obviously loops through everything and sets the last set of returned data onto my fragment. This causes me to have many fragments with the same data. What I need is to load one set of data onto each fragment instead of it loading the last set onto my fragment. So in essence, I have one fragment which loads many instances and each instance needs to show one objects data. How do I do thisp  pThanks in advance for any assistance.p  pOkay, please see below  This is the fragment class. Ive left out the OnCreateView of the fragment, as it only inflates the fragment resource and gets the textviews etc. Let me know if you need the FragmentPagerAdapter code as well. This one fragment has many instances, which is set in the FragmentPagerAdapter class in the Count and GetItem overidden methods.

Negative 881 pSo Im using Open Scene graph to create an application and I have a callback class that extends from OSGs callback class.  Its just a callback that is called each frame in the update event traversal of the scene graphs nodes.p  pI need different callback classes that do different operations on the nodes they are attached to.

Now depending on the node it might be a different class such as a transform or a switch.  p  pSo I need to make a dynamic cast but for each possible type the node may be.

This feels like bad design, but I cant figure out how to write a better implementation.  Maybe its not so bad with 3 types, but I may have more to add as I go along.  I thought about using a template class, but if Im not mistaken I cant have virtual methods in a template class.  I could just use non pure virtual methods with empty implementation I suppose that could then be overriden at choice.  What would a good approach be or suggested  p

Negative 881 pSo, I inherited a game project with the following setupp  ul liA core SWF of the game itself, written in Haxe 3.0NME 4.0.2, utilizing the Starling framework, compiled to a Flash target using FlashDevelopli liAn AS3 wrapper which deals with assorted device communication needs e.g. detecting device capabilities, managing phone lock state and pausing gamemuting music, etc. This is compiled into own SWF AIR 3.6, which is what is actually launched, and subsequently loads the core SWF and adds it the stage.li liThis AS3 SWF is subsequently packaged into the target formats APKIPA using ADT also AIR 3.6, along with its assets including the core SWF.li ul  pDespite the odd complexity, the whole thing worked just fine we created functional, usable apps that aworked on both Android and iOS devices, and b passed submission criteria.p  pFlash forward several months the game has now passed beta and is ready for initial release. Android, everything goes fine. iOS, the other hand... Just days before we attempted to upload 1.0 to iTunes Connect, Apple changed their requirements. Suddenly, we were getting the error Apps and app updates submitted to the App Store must be built with the public GM versions of Xcode 5.1.1 or later, and iOS 7 SDK or later. Dont submit apps built with beta software. Fine, an error that tripped up many a developer back in September. Eventually Adobe released AIR 15, and packaged IPAs once again met Apples submission requirements.p  pUnfortunately, updating to AIR 15 upset the applecart. We were now able to upload the IPA, but, ironically, it would not work on iOS devices. The loading screen generated by the pure AS3 wrapper SWF comes up, but then when the title screen generated by the core SWF should be appearing, theres nothing. Black screen, no activity, or alternatively on some later attempts, instant, messageless app disappearance. No errors generated on the iOS console, nothing untoward happening when stepping through the app in FDB right up until the app evaporates and FDB loses its connection to the remote host. p  pOther salient informationp  pI have tried updating literally every component involved in the process, assorted updates of AIR 15, and 16 beta. All of the listed haxelibs. Weve even tried porting the core project in the most cursory of manners to OpenFL.  All of these have resulted in versions that work on Windows desktop, not phone, work on Android, but do not work on iOS.p  pHaxelib libraries  Originalp  precodeactuate 1.6.4 [1.6.5] air3 [0.0.1] haxelibclient [3.1.0rc.3] hxcpp [3.0.2] nme [4.0.2] openfl [1.0.6] openfltools [1.0.10] 1.0.8 starling [1.2.2] swf [1.0.2] codepre  pExtra tasty crashyp  precodeactuate 1.7.0 [1.7.5] air3 [0.0.1] haxelibclient 3.1.0rc.3 [3.1.0rc.4] hxcpp 3.0.2 [3.1.39] hxcs [3.1.1] lime [2.0.0alpha.4] nme [4.0.2] 5.1.8 openflcompatibility [1.0.1] openflhtml5 [1.4.2beta] openflnative [1.4.0] openfltools [1.0.10] openfl 1.1.1 2.0.1 [2.1.2] starling [1.2.2] swf 1.0.2 [1.5.2] codepre  ptldr Old version of AIR app works on iOS but cant be submitted to iTunes.

Negative 881 pI have a database table mysql representing the entity emEmployeeem in an enterprise like application.

But I want the BOs to know nothing about the way they are storedloaded seperation of logic from persistence. The BOs hold the business logic for me and I want to work with them WITHOUT any coupling to type of storage database etc.. With my above class layout I could never instantiate an emEmployeeem without giving an codeidcode, so I guess this is not the correct way to implement a BO.p  pI want to work with DAO pattern to storeload emEmployeeem. Should I use the codeidcode only within DAO concernsp  pFurther I am concerned about identifying an emEmployeeem object in my application later, which would work well with the surrogate codeidcode.

Negative 881 pLets say I have a grayscale image in which I wish to detect and later identify a marker. It is also my task to construct an appropriate marker. As image is grayscale that means the marker should also be colors make no sense. It is also known that the marker will sometimes move horizontally across the image and wont move almost at all vertically this is important because of the motion blur. Given the previous I intend to make the marker similar to common AR markers by splitting the marker in half into left and right parts horizontally and splitting it in 46 pieces vertically because there will be very little motion blur over that dimension and coloring each field either black or white. My question is, what is the best approach to detecting such marker Marker may be rotated only around vertical axis so it can appear to be scaled only horizontally and light levels may also change. Would some sort of supervised machine learning technique work like LBP or Haar cascade classifiers The data should be easy to generate by recording a video. It could also be easily fabricated by cropping the marker and moving it around other images. The detection should run realtime.p

Negative 881 pI would like to have my MKCircle expand from 0 to its specified radius size whenever it gets added to the map.

I would like to animate it to have a smoother entrance, but I dont know how to do it without animation layers.p  pI have tried adding an expanding UIView with a CABasicAnimation and replacing it with an overlay on completion, but the code is ugly and there is a noticeable flicker when the overlay gets added. p  pIve looked at two other projects claiming to have animated overlays, but neither of them are the silver bullet Im looking for.p  ul lia hrefhttpyickhongios.blogspot.com201204animatedcircleonmkmapview.html relnofollowhttpyickhongios.blogspot.com201204animatedcircleonmkmapview.htmla Back in 2012 this guy subclassed MKCircleView, which apparently is deprecatedstrongly discouraged.li lia hrefhttpsgithub.comjhurrayiOS7AnimatedMapOverlay relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjhurrayiOS7AnimatedMapOverlaya This guy subclasses UIImageView, adds a circle png, and adds some CABasicAnimations to make it expand and fade. He then adds this image view to the map whenever an annotation gets selected. The animation works fine, but whenever the region starts changing, the animation gets removed, and is only added again when the region is done changing. It is not a functioning overlay that redraws on region changes. All he has is an MKCircle set to nil with a comment telling you change it if you want an overlay.  I could possibly change it to add the overlay when the UIImageView is done expanding, but something tells me it would produce the same flickery result as my UIView workaround.li ul  pTheres another approach Im considering that Im not too sure about because Ive never tried to produce animation effects from Core Graphics alone, and that is subclassing codeMKOverlayRenderercode, setting the custom drawing of MKCircle in code voiddrawMapRectcode to width and height x  0, and using an codeNSTimercode to increment x and call codesetNeedsDisplayInMapRectcode until the circle has reached its full size.

Negative 881 pIm writing an API in WCF. All of the business logic happens within the lower layer classes. It also happens to return one of those lower layer classes in DataContracts.

Negative 881 pThe basic setup is like this I have a UITableView with two proto cells that I am working with think of a messaging app, where one cell type shows messages you send and the other, messages you recieve. Now obviously the message length can vary from one line to even 100 lines thus I need variable cell heights. p  pstrongFirst attemptstrongp  precodetableView.estimatedRowHeight  75 tableView.rowHeight  UITableViewAutomaticDimension codepre  pI used codeestimatedRowHeightcode in my codeviewDidLoadcode. This works perfectly and computes cell heights very nicely. But because this is a messaging app I need to scroll the tableView all the way to bottom on codeviewDidLoadcode and whenever a new message is recieved  sent. But the codeestimatedRowHeightcode messes with the codetableViewcode scrolling all the way to bottom. Some say its a bug, some say its to be expected. Nonetheless, this way wont work for me at all.p  pstrongSecond Attemptstrongp  pcodefunc tableViewtableView UITableView, heightForRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath gt CGFloatcodep  pI thought to compute heights manually as sop  precodelet measuerWidth  UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds  var w  measuerWidth.size.width  this is so that we can limit label width to screen width so the text is forced to go to multiple lines   I probably should use my custom cell width here, but if I try to dequeue that cell its frame contents are always zero. Is that a problem             let lbl  UILabelframe CGRect.zeroRect lbl.text  chatMessages[indexPath.row][ChatRoomKeys.MESSAGETEXT] as String lbl.font  UIFont.systemFontOfSize20 lbl.numberOfLines  0 lbl.lineBreakMode  NSLineBreakMode.ByWordWrapping lbl.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, w, 0 lbl.sizeToFit   return lbl.frame.height  20 codepre  pThis way works almost perfectly however at times cell height isnt what it should be. Meaning sometimes if the text is one line plus one word, that one word wont show because the cell height was only for one line.p  pemIs there some better way to calculate the cell heightemp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Heres a screenshot of kinda what happensp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQrndr.png altenter image description herep  pas you can see  the label ends at codexcode but the original text goes upto codeycode.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuWvQh.png altenter image description herep  pThese are the proto cells I am using, the bottom cell is simply a mirror of the top one.p

be the same for every set of points p  pThe whole frame is moving in the same direction so no matter what matching points we look at the change should be the same should it notp  pWhat I am finding is that the points all different in the distance, some are 5 pixels different and some are 700 pixels, the only thing I can think is happening is that the match is not actually good and it is comparing

Negative 881 pI am working with itextsharp but this question is probably applies to itext also and I am adding digital signatures to PDFs. I have done reading and I understand that the length of a digital signature will vary based on LTV, and a hole host of other factors, so you typically will allocate an overly large buffer to hold the certificate information when you add the signature to a document to insure that it will have sufficient space.p  pThe thing that is puzzling to me is I see examples all over the net where a sig stamper is set up like thisp  precodeDictionaryltPdfName, intgt exc  new DictionaryltPdfName, intgt exc.AddPdfName.CONTENTS, BUFFERSIZE  2  2 sap.PreCloseexc codepre  pand then later is zeroed out p  precodebyte[] signaturebuffer  new byte[BUFFERSIZE]  int index  0 while index lt signaturebuffer.Length signaturebuffer[index]  0x20  PdfDictionary dic2  new PdfDictionary dic2.PutPdfName.CONTENTS, new PdfStringsignaturebuffer.SetHexWritingtrue codepre  pWhy do we create the initial dictionary entry with a buffer length  2  2 Why isnt it the same size as the one used by the PdfDictionary Is a case where sloppy code has just been copied all over the place, or is there a deeper reasonp

Negative 881 pI understand that how libcurl handles persistent connections by reusing the same handle. But I have a doubt on that and how it will work under the below scenario.p  pTheres an application written in C which uses a local database now I have to expose the database as a web service. So, Ill create a module which is uses libcurl to call the WS.p  pThe flow is like several clients will call the main application which will call the module to interface with WS.p  pSo, in this scenario for example there are 10 concurrent calls to application which will make 10 call the the WS module then I believe there will be 10 HTTP connections and as the flow completes all the connections will be closed. p  pIs there a way to take benefit of connection pooling and persistent connections because it has to handle large traffic.p  pMy understanding may be wrong, I have not much coding experience.p  pThank you.p

Negative 881 pSay I have a master pythonbehave feature file, and in said file, I check to see if 25, give or take, feature files exist, run each of them in their correct order, and then verify some postconditions.p  pI want to be able to test multiple features inside a single feature file, if thats possible. Ive written this stepp  precodewhenuFeature name is executed def stepmetafeaturecontext, name     context.scriptstarttime  datetime.datetime.now     printTesting feature   name     os.systembehave   name  .feature nocapture     context.scriptendtime  datetime.datetime.now codepre  pCurrently, whenever, in the when clauses of the main feature file, a feature is executed, this step will always run successfully. Im fairly certain this is because it isnt checking any conditions, and if a behave script is executed, whether it fails or not, this step will always pass.p  pIn order to fix this problem, I would like to add a lines, either in this step, or in the afterfeature function of the environment.py file to check if the executed behave feature passed.p  pBehaves API does say that it contains a Feature object, created from feature files, which returns a status variable that tells you whether the feature passed or failed. However, that status variable only seems to be accessible within the environment.py file.p  pMy thinking is that I would find a way to execute a feature object from within the step using behaves functionality instead of os.system, and check its status afterwards, but I dont know if thats possible. Alternatively, I understand that I could write a single feature file that executes the 25 scenarios in order, but has all of the scenarios in the file. However I want to avoid doing that since the primary script is split out into 25 smaller scripts for individual testing purposes. Also, it wouldnt be a great idea to have several smaller features and one big feature that does what all of the smaller feature does in the same folder, running in some arbitrary order.p  pHow can I check from within environment.py or steps.py if a feature from another file passed or failedp  pEDIT Another idea I guess is to find a way to output the text that is sent to the command line to a featureforfeature log file and read the last few lines to find if any features or steps failed, although that seems like a roundabout way of doing things.p

One card will add a point to the score while the other 4 will take a life away.

Then, when the player clic the first card, the script will compare the random number stored on externalVariable to check if the first card is actually the right card or not. Either way, the last step is reload the same scene to start all over again.p  pThe very fist time the scene is loaded everything runs perfect. My problem start with the second time the scene is loaded externalVariable is always zero. Now for the tricky part, if I put the very same code on the Update section instead of the Start section, for one or two seconds the externalVariable stays at zero and then change for the random number generated.p  pMy guess is, Im doing something wrong when I reload the scene to start again, but I dont know what.p  pAny ideas about why the code works fine the very first time on the Start section and every single time on the Update sectionp  pUPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE.p  pThe whole code attached to card1p  precodeusing UnityEngine using System.Collections using UnityEngine.UI using System.IO using System using System.Threading  public class Card1 MonoBehaviour     private string querySeleccionar  SELECT Nivel FROM LevelAndDifficultyWHERE id1    Text textoSilaba1  public GameObject cardImage1  public int level  public int externalVariable  public GameObject objetoExterno   public void SeleccionarSilaba        switch externalVariable                case 1              UnityEngine.Debug.LogYou win a point              Application.LoadLevelMini Juego 1              break           case 2              UnityEngine.Debug.LogYou lose a life              Application.LoadLevelMini Juego 1              break           case 3              UnityEngine.Debug.LogYou lose a life              Application.LoadLevelMini Juego 1              break           case 4              UnityEngine.Debug.LogYou lose a life              Application.LoadLevelMini Juego 1              break           case 5              UnityEngine.Debug.LogYou lose a life              Application.LoadLevelMini Juego 1              break           public void OnMouseDown         Use this for initialization  void Start         lot of database stuff       switch level                case 1           lots of cases            externalVariable externalObject.GetComponentltMiniGame1RightCardgt.rightCard      UnityEngine.Debug.LogThe right card is card number   externalVariable         Update is called once per frame void Update        codepre  pThe script that generate the random number p  precode     using UnityEngine  using System.Collections   public class MiniGame1RightCard MonoBehaviour        public int rightCard        Use this for initialization      void Start                 silabaCorrecta  UnityEngine.Random.Range1, 5          UnityEngine.Debug.LogThe right card is card number   rightCard              Update is called once per frame      void Update                 codepre

I am curious if anyone out there can explain to me exactly how the codesetDevicecode function within the codeQXmlStreamReadercode object class works.

I am looking for a detailed understanding of how this works, I know that I should be able to figure it out, but Im simply not that proficient yet at low level functionality within the c language. Thank you for any insight into this, you will really be helping me understand how the function works, which is very important to me.p

Negative 881 pVisual Studio 2013 C projects have a codeGScode switch to enable buffer security check validation at runtime. We are encountering many more STATUSSTACKBUFFEROVERRUN errors since upgrading to VS 2013, and suspect it has something to do with improved checking of buffer overrun in the new compiler. Ive been trying to verify this and better understand how buffer overrun is detected. Im befuddled by the fact that buffer overrun is reported even when the memory updated by a statement only changes the contents of another local variable on the stack in the same scope  So it must be checking not only that the change doesnt corrupt memory not owned by a local variable, but that the change doesnt affect any local variable other than that allocated to the one referenced by the individual update statement. How does this work Has it changed since VS 2010p  pstrongEditstrong Heres an example illustrating a case that Mysticials explanation doesnt coverp  precodevoid TestFunc1  int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]     TestFunc1    return 0   void TestFunc1     char buffer1[4]  123    char buffer2[4]  456    int diff  buffer1  buffer2    printfdn, diff    getchar    buffer2[4]  0  codepre  pThe output is code4code indicating that the memory about to be overwritten is within the bounds of codebuffer1code immediately after codebuffer2code, but then the program terminates with a buffer overrun. Technically it should be considered a buffer overrun, but I dont know how its being detected since its still within the local variables storage and not really corrupting anything outside local variables.p  pThis screenshot with memory layout proves it. After stepping one line the program aborted with the buffer overrun error. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comBmm9i.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBmm9i.png altDebugger screenshot with memory layoutap  pI just tried the same code in VS 2010, and although debug mode caught the buffer overrun with a buffer offset of 12, in release mode it did strongnotstrong catch it with a buffer offset of 8. So I think VS 2013 tightened the behavior of the codeGScode switch.p  pstrongEdit 2strong I managed to sneak past even VS 2013 range checking with this code. It still did not detect that an attempt to update one local variable actually updated anotherp  precodevoid TestFunc     char buffer1[4]  123    char buffer2[4]  456    int diff    if buffer1 lt buffer2           putsSequence 1,2       diff  buffer2  buffer1        else           putsSequence 2,1       diff  buffer1  buffer2         printfOffset dn, diff    switch getchar        case 1       putsUpdating buffer 1       buffer1[diff]         break    case 2       putsUpdating buffer 2       buffer2[diff]         break        getchar  Eat enter keypress    printfs,sn, buffer1, buffer2  codepre

Negative 881 pLooking the documentation of AWS Elastic Cache I can see they support Redis Cluster and talk about keyvalue data and Redis operations in general. However is not clear for me if this will support replication of Redis pubsub along the different servers.p  pWe are building a chat server on nodexmpp. We will have many application servers for handling chat connections and we are relying on Redis pubsub for handling the communication between chat threads. We require that regardless the actual Redis instance each chat server is communicating to, they can share the same pubsub channel.p  pAt a hrefhttpsd0.awsstatic.comwhitepapersperformanceatscalewithamazonelasticache.pdf relnofollowAWS Elastic cache white paper page 7 a they indicate to use Redis if you want pubsub. I understand from this that AWS Elastic Cache will actual support pubsub scalability but Im not convinced yet.p
