Positive 6828 pHavent got a whole lot of experience in making android apps. Is it possible to addremove user input widgets and actions to an android in the field without having to recompile and reinstallp  pI am thinking the user should be able to use a service that constructs a simple interface inside the app they have installed beforehand.p  pSo like creating a building a htmlform from a json object. A series of widgets and validation rules, which is known individually beforehand, but strung together in a dynamically defined series.p  pDoes that make sense I am sorry, its a little hard to explain and I am not a native english speaker.p  pI could of course a webview or just make it a webapp and use the browser or maybe phonegap or something like it will have the tools for doing this, but I just really wanted to use a native app for it, if possible.p  pI have tried googling, but with no luck.p  pIs this possible to do If so howp

Positive 6828 pMicrosoft recently said that on Xbox One Halo 5 will dynamically lower resolution at which game renders to maintain 60fps.p  pAt first I though haha consoles so lamep  pBut then I played PC MMOFPS Firefall, which has same option, basically you have one slider for minimum fps and one slider for maximum  of resolution to lower.p  pJust for fun I set it to 60fps and lowest 50 which means at my 1920x1080 I allow game to downres to 960x540 and then set graphics to Everything Ultra.p  pAnd I have to say I never in my life seen game run so smooth, no matter what happened on the screen be it mass battle versus hundreds of npcs or cluttered city with dozens of highly rendered players game never went lower than 60fps. Instead its just got a little blurry. Practically every time I normally would expect dip in fps or microlag instead it was just few blurry frames.p  pAfter that I wondered, why this isnt option in NvidiaAti drivers And is it possible to write as separate program, which hooks to game or driver.p

Positive 6828 pI am writing a plugin for a 3rd party app which I only have the .EXE and dot net .DLL for. p  pThe way I code the plugin is by creating a Visual Studio C library project, add the .EXE and .DLL files from the 3rd party app as references, then extend the emIPluginem class defined in the .DLL.p  pAfter I build my project I take my plugins .DLL and copy it to the 3rd party applications Plugins directory then start the application. From that point on I really dont know what happens at that point. I guess the application dynamically loads my DLL by scanning the emPluginsem folder then loads it all that stuff I know nothing about.p  pAt that point the application is running as a .EXE. p  pIs there a way I can use Visual Studio to attach to the .EXE process and then debug my DLL code thats running from withing that processp  pI know my code is in there somewhere but since its not an .EXE I dont see how I could attach to it. Thank you,p  pJanp

Positive 6828 pI am having a problem with assigning new values to a dynamic int array that is a data member variable of the class IntersectionFlowRate. I can initialize and print the values of the array inside the constructor. However, when I exit the constructor to the another class and then later call a function within the IntersectionFlowRate class passing in variables to overwrite the initial values of the data member it will segmentation fault.

Positive 6828 h1Preambleh1  pWhen a webpage is dynamically generated by javascript based on a hashbang codecode url, google has a hard time indexing it, and cannot provide search results or automatically accept it for services like AdSense.p  pOne solution is to introduce the codeescapedfragmentcode GET variable and serve static a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebmastersajaxcrawlingdocsspecification relnofollowhtml snapshotsa that represent the dynamic content.p  pThis can be done manually by visiting the website in Chrome, copy the DOM from emDeveloper Console  Elementsem, save it to a codehtmlcode file, and serve these html files when the hashbang is requested in the codeescapedfragmentcode.p  h1Problemh1  pThis is doable for the main pages, but trying to manually follow all the links and save the DOM once all the scripts have executed is nearly undoable.p  pFurthermore, this process should be repeated once in a while so the snapshots dont deviate too much from the actual website.p  h1Questionh1  pI am wondering if there is a tool or chrome extension that automates this. Open a link, let the javascript generate the DOM, and save the DOM to a file named after the hashbang.p  pIdeally this would be simple enough to do from the terminal so this can be automated using codeGruntcode on deploy.p

Only one answer by Jason Baker with two positive comments amp votes actively discouraged me from doing this, however doing so based on the example use case moreso than on the technique in general.pli lipNone of the answers, whether positive or not, finds an actual technical problem in this method. A small exception is jls who mentions to beware of oldstyle classes, which is likely true, and C extensions. I suppose that newstyleclassaware C extensions should be as fine with this method as Python itself presuming the latter is true, although if you disagree, keep the answers coming.pli ul  pAs to the question of how pythonic this is, there were a few positive answers, but no real reasons given. Looking at the Zen codeimport thiscode, I guess the most important rule in this case is Explicit is better than implicit. Im not sure, though, whether that rule speaks for or against reclassing this way.p  ul lipUsing codehas,get,setattrcode seems more explicit, as we are explicitly making our changes to the object instead of using magic.pli lipUsing codeclass  newclasscode seems more explicit because we explicitly say This is now an object of class newclass, expect a different behaviour instead of silently changing attributes but leaving users of the object believing they are dealing with a regular object of the old class.pli ul  pSumming up From a technical standpoint, the method seems okay the pythonicity question remains unanswered with a bias towards yes. p  pI have accepted Martin Geislers answer, because the Mercurial plugin example is a quite strong one and also because it answered a question I even hadnt asked myself yet. However, if there are any arguments on the pythonicity question, Id still like to hear them. Thanks all so far.p  pP.S. The actual use case is a UI data control object that needs to grow additional functionality emat runtimeem. However, the question is meant to be very general.p

Negative 6828 pI have a source directory that includes a mix of different languages and files.  Probably 100 total files.

I will not make that much development on version1.  I want to change the documentation headers and some other small changes.

Negative 6828 pI have a WCF service that does some document conversions and returns the document to the caller. When developing locally on my local dev server, the service is hosted on ASP.NET  Development server, a console application invokes the operation and executes within seconds.p  pWhen I host the service in IIS via a .svc file, two of the documents work correctly, the third one bombs out, it begins to construct the word document using the OpenXml Sdk, but then just dies.

In a nutshell this is how it worksp  pSQL 2005 DBIBM DB2  WCF Service written by other developer to expose data. This service only has one endpoint using basicHttpBindingp  pMy Service invokes his service, gets the relevant data, uses the Open Xml Sdk to generate a Microsoft Word Document, saves it on a server and returns the path to the user.p  pThe word documents are no bigger than 100KB.p  pI am also using basicHttpBinding although I have tried wsHttpBinding with the same results.p  pWhat is amazing is how fast it is locally, and even more that two of the documents generate just fine, its the third document type that refuses to work.p  pstrongTo the error messagestrongp  pAn error occured while receiving the HTTP Response to a hrefhttpmyservername.mydomain.incMyServiceService.Svc relnofollowhttpmyservername.mydomain.incMyServiceService.Svca. This could be due to the service endpoint binding not using the HTTP Protocol. This could also be due to an HTTP request context being aborted by the server possibly due to the server shutting down. See server logs for more details.p  pI have spent the last 2 days trying to figure out what is going on, I have tried everything, including changing the maxReceivedMessageSize, maxBufferSize, maxBufferPoolSize, etc etc to large values, I even includedp  precode lthttpRuntime maxRequestLength2097151 executionTimeout120gt codepre  pTo see maybe if IIS was choking because of that.p  pProgramatically the service does nothing special, it just constructs the word documents from the data using the Open Xml Sdk and like I said, locally all 3 documents work when invoked via a console app running locally on the asp.net dev server, i.e. a hrefhttplocalhost3332myService.svc relnofollowhttplocalhost3332myService.svcap  pWhen I host it on IIS and I try to get a Windows Forms application to invoke it, I get the error.p  pI know you will ask for logs, so yes I have logging enabled on my Host.p  pAnd there is strongno error in the logsstrong, I am logging everything.p  pBasically I invoke two service operations written by another developer.p  pMyOperation calls  HisOperation1 and then HisOperation2, both of those calls give me complex types. I am going to look at his code tomorrow, because he is using LINQ2SQL and there may be some funny business going on there. He is using a variety of collections etc, but the fact that I can run the exact same document, lets call it Document 3 within seconds when the service is being hosted locally on ASP WebDev Server is what is most odd, why would it run on scaled down Cassini and blow up on IISp  pFrom the log it seems, after calling HisOperation1 and HisOperation2 the service just goes into lala land dies, there is a application pool w3wp.exe error in the Windows Event Log.p  precodeFaulting application w3wp.exe, version 6.0.3790.1830, stamp 42435be1, faulting module kernel32.dll, version 5.2.3790.3311, stamp 49c5225e, debug 0, fault address 0x00015dfa. codepre  pIts classified as .NET 2.0 Runtime error.p  pAny help is appreciated, the lack of sleep is getting to me.p  pHelp me ObiWan Kenobi, youre my only hope.p

Negative 6828 pI need a very FAST and lightweight jquery based Modal box on my site, I am looking at Facebox a hrefhttpfamspam.comfacebox relnofollowhttpfamspam.comfaceboxa   p  pIt is a nice plugin and it seems fast and lightweight but I think I can still strip out some of the features I do not need.  For example I do not need it to use regex and find photos, so I have removed that part of the code, also I do not want the box to close whenever you click anywhere or the escape key.  I have this partially done, I removed the code that makes the escape key close the box but I have not figured out how to make it only close programaticly or when clicking the close button only, right now it closes on any click outside of the box. p  pNow I have one issue I have not been able to figure out yet, there appears to be 2 spots in the code that control the delay of fading the box in and out, they were set at 200 and I changed them to 0 and tried several other number combinations but I can not seem to get the speed to be faster less delay.p  pDoes anyone know how to remove the delay in opening a facebox  Also how to disable it from closing when you click anywhere outside of the boxp

Negative 6828 pIm using Quartz2D for iPhone to display a route on a map. The route is colored according to temperature.

This will be installed on the server. p  pFirst I need to check if the executable file is opened via a network share.  I can do this manually by going into Computer Management then Shared files and Open files.  This seems to be the only way to check if the file is open.  I tried using RW to check if the file is opened but this did not work. Looked at Win32ServerConnection but this just listed number of files that were open not the names. p  pI would like to code this in Delphi 7 or C if it cant be done in Delphi. I have found a few programs that can view the open files on a server but nothing on how this can be done. p
Negative 6828 pThis is a common need I have on every pagep  precodeif session[LoggedIn]  null  boolsession[LoggedIn]  true ....user is not logged in. return. codepre  pI was wondering, is there a way I can create a class Helper with a method signature codebool IsLoggedIncode and call that method from a page so that automatically it can check if the page it was called from has the codesession[LoggedIn]code set to codetruecode Something like thisp  precodeclass Helper    public bool IsLoggedIn        System.Web.UI.Page page  FindCallerPageSomeHow     ifpage.session[LoggedIn]  null  boolpage.session[LoggedIn]  true       return false     return boolpage.HpptContext.Session[LoggedIn]  true     codepre  pOfcourse, I could try implementing an interface for each codebehind class, but thats repetitive. Also, I could pass in the codeHttpContextcode for codeIsLoggedIncode, but thats a bit of clutter..p  pAny ideas Is there a simpletoimplement pattern for thisp
Negative 6828 pFirst question here. Anyway, here it goesp  pI have a XAML Windows with a lot of DatePicker controls DatePicker from the WPFToolkit on CodePlex. Every DatePicker has a default Value of 111990 and if no other date is selected, I want or rather my boss   to display the Text in gray italic and not in Black. Thus, it makes it easy to see which fields the Date has not yet been entered.p  pThis might be easy, but Im quite new to WPFXAML. In fact, these are my first steps using it. p  pSo here is what I have and which works great actuallyp  precode    ltStyle TargetTypexType myDatePickergt         ltStyle.Triggersgt             ltTrigger PropertyText Value111990gt                 ltSetter PropertyForeground ValueDarkGraygt                 ltSetter PropertyToolTip ValuePlease select a dategt                 ltSetter PropertyFontStyle ValueItalicgt             ltTriggergt         ltStyle.Triggersgt     ltStylegt codepre  pProblem is, it doesnt work on every machine because of localizationregional settings issues obviously. p  pSo I tried thisp  precode ltStyle TargetTypexType myDatePickergt     ltStyle.Triggersgt         ltTrigger PropertyText ValueBinding SourcexStatic pSettings.Default, PathMinDate, ModeTwoWaygt             ltSetter PropertyForeground ValueDarkGraygt             ltSetter PropertyToolTip ValueVeuillez choisir une dategt             ltSetter PropertyFontStyle ValueItalicgt         ltTriggergt     ltStyle.Triggersgt ltStylegt codepre  pNotice the difference in the Value property of the trigger. This yields following errorp  blockquote   pA Binding cannot be set on the   Value property of type Trigger. A   Binding can only be set on a   DependencyProperty of a   DependencyObject.p blockquote  pWhich I do understand the meaning of and I understand why this doesnt work. Note that MinDate is of type DateTime with Value 111990 p  pSo, how could I achieve the result from my first code snippet on all computersp  pThanks for the time.p

Negative 6828 pI started experimenting with Spring Roo just recently. It does a very nice job helping one build a domain model with integrated persistence rather quickly. As it adds persistence functionality in aspects, I started think about the following questionp  pRoo adds finders load an instance of a class from the database which meets variable criteria in an aspect to the actual classentity. In DDD this is IMHO the responsibility of repositories. Repositories are explicit classes which show up in the design. Of course as an aspect the repository functionality is hidden in an entity and is pretty much invisible.p  pSo here is the question Is an aspect a real substitute for a explicit repository class Are there any downsides to the Roo AOP approachp

Now I need to have an excel file which shows all the columns of inputs of the past day. So I thought the best way to do this is to use SSIS packages. I never really used SSIS that much so Im not very sure how wide the possibilities are. So at the moment Im only capable of creating an SSIS package of emALLem my inputs. But I need a new file every day, but also where the filename has the data in it, because the old files will not be deleted etc. So I need to be able to create an .xls file with the date in the filename. Is there an easy way to do thisp  pI was also wondering if its possible to automaticly modify the layout for this excel file, especially the column widths, since they are all the default width, which is not very usefull for clients.p  pI heard its also possible to create SSIS packages with visual studio, would this make a difference or are the possibilities the same Keep in mind that Im a c programmerp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 6828 pIve got SOA which processing data for diff clientsasp,sl. The base of this design is domains of my business model. For transporting,showing it to clients I use DTO. For mapping domain to DTO  I use AutoMapper. Now I should persist new entities from clients. I want use my DTOs at this scenario too. So ive got some questions as Im not much familiar with this designp  p1 Is it a good practice build DTO on client and send it to webservice on the wire MayBe i should pass my domainsp  p2 Is it possible have several DTOs to one domain one show at grid, and one to save.

Negative 6828 pBackground Ive created an online circuit design application where .draggable div tags are containers that contain smaller div containers and so forth.p  pQuestion For any particular div tag I need to quickly identify if it contains other div tags that may in turn contain other div tags.p  p Since the div tags are draggable, in the DOM they are NOT nested inside each other but I think are absolutely positioned.  p  pSo I think that a hit testing approach is the only way to determine containment, unless there is some secret routine builtin somewhere that could help with this.p  pIve searched JQuery and I dont see any builtin routine for this. Does anyone know of an algorithm thats quicker than On2p  pSeems like I have to walk the list of div tags in an outer loop n and have an inner loop another n to compare against all other div tags and do a containment test position, width, height, building a list of contained div tags. Thats nsquared. Then I have to build a list of all nested div tags by concatenating contained lists. So the total would be On2n.p  pThere must be a better wayp

Negative 6828 pI have some problems drawing some custom content over a UITableView. What I did was subclass UITableView and overwrite the voiddrawRect method something like this  p  precode voiddrawRectCGRectrect      CGContextRef ctx  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext      [super drawRectrect]      CGContextSetRGBFillColorctx, 255, 0, 0, 1.0f      CGContextFillRectctx, CGRectMake10, 10, 10, 10  codepre  pThe problem is that i see my red rectangle but its underneath the table view cells. Even if I comment the [super drawRectrect] call in the method above, the cells will still display. p  pMy guess is that internally whoever calls the drawRect method for the tableview, draws the cells afterwards, meaning the overwriting drawRect is not enough because the cells will always be drawn afterwards.p
Negative 6828 pLet me explain the tree structure I have a network directory where several times a day new .txt files are copied by our database. Those files sit on directory based on usernames.

Negative 6828 pI am writing a numerical code, in which I would like to use a thirdpartywritten shared library. I am working on an x8664 k8 architecture, under CentOS. The desired target that I would like to build would be either a Python or a Matlab extension module, which are, from what I understand, gccbuilt dynamicallylinked shared libraries, with extra MatlabPython scaffolding built in. Ill focus on Python here, as the same problem happens, and it is probably more familiar to the community.p  pThe library developer provided me originally with dynamic library and some test code written in C. Thats how he intended to distribute his library. I should make a note that I am trying to burden the original developer as little as possible, since the library probably being a sideproject for him some time ago, and his test code ends up working OK. Therefore, I am trying to resolve issues on my end to the largest extent I can on my end. I managed to build his examples into executables, only with gcc 4.5.0. Usual gcc version that I use, 4.1.2, produced four undefined reference to errors during linking with g, specifically to codeMinsertltlonggtlongcode, codeMwideninitcode, codeMinsertltdoublegtdoublecode and codeostreaminsertltchar, stdchartraitsltchargt gtcode. These are all part of codestdcode namespace. Compiling with g 4.5.0 resolved these undefined references and the example executables run correctly. Per E.R.s comment, codereadelf x.comment libmaxentk8.socode, indicates the original libraries were built with gcc 4.4.1.p  pTo test whether linking to a Python extension works, Ive built a small, Python extension function in C that just adds two numbers. Specifically, it doesnt use anything from the library I would like to use. The interface was SWIG 2.0 generated, compiled with g 4.50. and the code runs fine in Python 2.4.3. However, when I try to link to the original library, without ever referencing any symbols from it, the code again links fine, but then during runtime, while importing the extension, I get codeImportError libmaxentk8.so undefined symbol ZNSo9MinsertIlEERSoTcode, which, by codecfiltcode, is the codeMinsertlongcode, which is one of the original ones, that were undefined when the C code was linked using g 4.1.2.p  pI suspect the issue is with mismatched libstdc versions during linking and runtime of python, but I dont know how to resolve this. The bestcase scenario for me would let me somehow get away without gcc 4.5.0 when linking the extensions, perhaps I was jumping ahead when resolving the original 4 missing references problem. Could the issue be resolved by bing built with somehow statically linking to libstdc 6.0.14 which is a part of gcc 4.5.0 statically, while still retaining their character as dynamically linked libraries Although, the Python has no problem of cooperating with gcc 4.5.0, Matlab does, and their support claims reliability only up to gcc 4.2.0. For this reason I would like to keep away from compiling with 4.5.0 as little as possible. My gcc comes with 6.0.8 version of libstdc.p  pHere are some reports on the library in question. Remember, despite all these references, the code worked when compiled directly to an executable.p  precode readelf aD homembudisiclib64libmaxentk8.so  grep NEEDED 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libgccs.so.1] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libc.so.6]   ldd d libmaxentk8.so  undefined symbol ZSt4cerr .libmaxentk8.so undefined symbol ZNSt8iosbase4InitD1Ev   .libmaxentk8.so undefined symbol ZSt4cout .libmaxentk8.so undefined symbol gxxpersonalityv0  .libmaxentk8.so     libgccs.so.1 gt lib64libgccs.so.1 0x00002b92457f3000     libc.so.6 gt lib64libc.so.6 0x00002b9245a01000     lib64ldlinuxx8664.so.2 0x000000366e200000 codepre  pRunning codenm uC libmaxentk8.socode results in 35 U labeled symbols, and two w labeled symbols, from libm and libstdc libraries, which is far more than reported as undefined in linkingrunning.p

It uses my limited understanding of the matrix structure inside the src image, and uses pointer arithmetic to traverse the pixels. p  precode  void foregroundIplImage src, IplImage dst, codeBook c, int minMod, int maxMod   int height  srcgtheight  int width  srcgtwidth   uchar srcCurrent  uchar srcgtimageData  uchar srcRowHead  srcCurrent  int srcChannels  srcgtnChannels  int srcRowWidth  srcgtwidthStep   uchar dstCurrent  uchar dstgtimageData  uchar dstRowHead  dstCurrent   dst has 1 channel  int dstRowWidth  dstgtwidthStep   forint row  0 row lt height row   forint column  0 column lt width column    dstCurrent  findforegroundsrcCurrent, c, srcChannels, minMod, maxMod    dstCurrent    c    srcCurrent  srcChannels      srcCurrent  srcRowHead  srcRowWidth   srcRowHead  srcCurrent   dstCurrent  dstRowHead  dstRowWidth   dstRowHead  dstCurrent     void backgroundIplImage src, codeBook c, unsigned learnBounds   int height  srcgtheight  int width  srcgtwidth   uchar srcCurrent  uchar srcgtimageData  uchar srcRowHead  srcCurrent  int srcChannels  srcgtnChannels  int srcRowWidth  srcgtwidthStep   forint row  0 row lt height row   forint column  0 column lt width column    updatecodebooksrcCurrent, c[rowcolumn], learnBounds, srcChannels    srcCurrent  srcChannels      srcCurrent  srcRowHead  srcRowWidth   srcRowHead  srcCurrent    codepre  pThe program works, but is very sluggish. Is there something obvious that is slowing it down Or is it an inherent problem in the simple implementation Is there anything I can do to speed it up Each code book is sorted in no specific order, so it does take linear time to process each pixel. So double the background samples, and the program runs slower by 2 for each pixel, which is then magnified by the number of pixels. But as the implementation stands, I dont see any clear, logical way to sort the code element entries. p  pI am aware that there is an example implementation of the same algorithm in the opencv samples. However, that structure seems to be much more complex. I am looking more to understand the reasoning behind this method, I am aware that I can just modify the sample for real life applications. p  pThanksp
Negative 6828 pIm trying to set up an email receipt to send to the user who fills out the form. Im using Webform 6.x3.1.

Negative 6828 pI have two nested UIScrollViews the parent limited to horizontal paging and the child limited to vertical scrolling.  The content is one large view that can be freely dragged around, but snaps to one of three horizontal sections.  The default behavior of the nested scroll views is to only allow scrolling in one direction at a time, but I wanted to allow simultaneous dragging in both direction to maintain the feeling of manipulating a single large view.p  pMy present solution involved isolating the vertical scroll views gesture and setting its delegate to my view controllerp  precodefor UIGestureRecognizer gesture in scrollView.gestureRecognizers     if [gesture isKindOfClass[UIPanGestureRecognizer class]]         gesture.delegate  self codepre  pThen, I implemented the delegate method to allow the gestures of the paging view to recognize simultaneously with the pan gesture of the scroll viewp  precode BOOLgestureRecognizerUIGestureRecognizer gestureRecognizer shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizerUIGestureRecognizer otherGestureRecognizer      if gestureRecognizer.view  scrollView ampamp otherGestureRecognizer.view  pageView         return YES  allow simultaneous scrolling of pageView and scrollView      return NO  codepre  pThis solution mostly works, but it will occasionally act glitchy when I drag the view around, particularly when I move it around quickly with mouse or drag it around past the view bounds.  Specifically, one of the scroll views will temporarily jump back to where it started as if that gesture had been canceled, but then it will jump back if I keep scrolling.p  pWhat I want to know is if there is a simpler or more reliable method to achieve scrolling like this that Ive overlooked, or if theres anything that I can do to eliminate the glitchy behavior.p
Negative 6828 pIm having an issue with a new application on the iPhone SDK using SQLite as the DB backend.p  pOccasionally, my app will stop loading data to my UITableViews and after downloading the device DB via the Organizer I can access the SQLite DB via the command line.

The app doesnt crash, the data just doesnt load because of this malformed error.p  pAny ideas why this is happening  My only thought is that maybe the DB is being corrupted because I am writing to the SQLite DB via a background thread within the app.  I download data from a webserver via an NSOperationQueue in a background thread and update the SQLite DB with the data downloaded.  Would writing to the DB in a background thread while potentially reading from the main thread corrupt the DB, or is it something elsep

Negative 6828 pWhen setting up replication in Sql Server 2008 the system creates triggers on every replicated table in order to facilitate the transfer of data to the subscribing databases.p  pWould it be expected behaviour for system generated triggers to use codeSET NOCOUNT ONcode to prevent their actions affecting the value of the codeROWCOUNTcode functionp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI am using NHibernate with a Sql Server 2008 backend database. The database has replication enabled which creates system generated triggers on the published tables to facilitate the data transfer to the subscribers.p  pWithout the replication everything works fine, but with the replication NHibernates rows affected verification checks fail. The number of rows that ADO.Net says it has affected appears to include the rows affected by the associated trigger in addition to the rows affected by the command itself.p  pIn the original question I mentioned the codeROWCOUNTcode Sql Server function, but what I really mean is the rows affected value returned by the ADO.Net codeExecuteNonQuerycode method. I suppose I was working on the assumption possibly incorrectly that that latter was fed by the former.p  pAs a temporary solution we have modified the replication triggers to add the codeSET NOCOUNT ONcode before any updates and to reverse this after any updates are complete. This solves our problem for the time being, but is not a viable permanent solution. According to advice we have received and common sense, editing the system triggers is not recommended.p  pThis does however suggest to me that we have identified the exact problem. The rows affected by the triggers are getting included in the final rows affected count for the current command. NHibernate expects only a known number of rows to be affected, it doesnt provision for any unknown as far as NHibernate is concerned triggers adding to this count.p  pWe are currently in the process of investigating options that involve extending NHibernate to add capability to deal with or at least suppress this. Our resources include a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1354362toomanyrowsaffectedexceptionwithencryptedtriggersthis SO questiona.p  pI have also found a hrefhttpwww.sqldev.orgsqlserverreplicationhowtoconfigurereplicationtriggerstosetnocounton73762.shtml relnofollowthis posta that seems to suggest that system generated triggers would already set the NOCOUNT option to ON by default, negating the need to modify them. This is definitely not the case for us, so I was wondering why this might be. p  ol liWhat is the default situation with regard to the system generated triggersli liIs the behaviour configurableli liDoes it depend on the type of replication  merge, transactionalli ol

Negative 6828 pI am currently trying to improve the performance of a web application. The goal of the application is to provide codereal time analyticscode. We have a database model that is similiar to a codestar schemacode, few fact tables and many dimensional tables. The database is running with codeMysqlcode and codeMyIsamcode engine.br The Fact table size can easily go into the upper millions and some dimension tables can also reach the millions.br Now the point is, select queries can get awfully slow if the dimension tables get joined on the fact tables and also aggretations are done. First thing that comes in mind when hearing this is, why not precalculate the data This is not possible because the users are allowed to use several freely customizable filters.  p  pSo what I need is an allinone system suitable for every purpose  Sadly it wasnt invented yet. So I came to the idea to combine 2 existing systems. Mixing a coderow orientedcode and a codecolumn orientedcode database e.g. like codeinfinidbcode or codeinfobrightcode. Keeping the mysql MyIsam solution for fast inserts and row based queries and add a column oriented database for fast aggregation operations on few columns to it and fill it periodically nightly via cronjob. Problem would be when the current data it must be real time is queried, therefore I maybe would need to get data from both databases which can complicate things.p  pFirst tests with infinidb showed really good performance on aggregation of a few columns, so I really think this could help me speed up the application.  p  pSo the question is, is this a good idea Has somebody maybe already done this Maybe there is are better ways to do it.  p  pI have no experience in column oriented databases yet and Im also not sure how the schema of it should look like. First tests showed good performance on the same codestar schema likecode structure but also in a codebig table likecode structure.p  pI hope this question fits on SO.p

So my question is how does rails know which view gets which values assuming multiple simultaneuos requests Since each controller instance is shared, is it wise to put values in the instance variablesp

In attempting to run these programs as a normal domain user on Windows I see them when running up without any command line arguments or switches attempting to update chunks of HKEYCURRENTCLASSES.  this fails due to lac of permission to the HKCR hive.  It appears that the act of running a Delphi 6 COM server causes it to attempt to register its embedded COM types with the system registry.p  pI do not want this behavior normally.  We would do this once during install under and adminatrative account to initalise the COM registry, but would not want to do this under normal running conditions of a non adminastrative account. if you moniroy the system with sys internals process monitor you can see the failed registry key access attempts.  p  pIs there a command line switch I can pass to a Delphi 6 COM server to prevent this automatic COM registrtion logicp

Everything worked fine for about 2 month, but a problem occurred now. I am trying to modify some .tpl files and after I save and upload on server the one on the virtual machine the server gives me the old version of the page.p  pAlready cleared cache, change browser, etc... is not browser related. I tried on different computers and all have the same result.p  pI also checked the uploaded file and it is the new one.p  pIf I delete the file I get the error what is normal. If I delete the file then upload the new file I still get the old version.p  pI i delete everything inside the file directly on the uploaded file  ftp I still get the old version.p  pWhen I first ask this I got the suggestion to disable smarty caching, did it and worked... but it seems it was a coincidence and now it happens again but the fix doesnt work  .p

Negative 6828 pThe requirement is to display all public content and all content that has been restricted to the viewers region. p  pCurrently this is being accomplished by producing two views in blocks on a standard page.   One view is set up to display all news articles that do not have a N in a restrict to region field.  Another view is set up to display all news articles that have a Y in a restrict to region field AND uses php code in a contextual filter to add the condition that the region field in the news article matches the region field in the user profile.  Stacking these views in the content field of a standard page results in a page that returns all news articles that are not restricted AND all news articles that are restricted to the users region.p  pUndesirable complications of this strategy include separate pagination and the necessity of creating multiple views to extend the functionality to additional content types or to expand to cities or states.p  pCan you think of a way to apply the complex filter on a single view so as to avoid the need for presenting a separate unrestricted view followed by a view restricted to records whos region matches the viewers region   p  pOr to apply the filter as a permission on fieldsp  pThanks n advance,p

Negative 6828 pThe below text is an effort to expand and add color to this questionp  pHow do I prevent a misbehaving client from taking down the entire servicep  pI have essentially this scenario a WCF service is up and running with a client callback having a straight forward, simple oneway communication, not very different from this onep  precodepublic interface IMyClientContract    [OperationContractIsOneWay  true]   void SomethingChangedsimpleObject myObj  codepre  pIm calling this method potentially thousands of times a second from the service to what will eventually be about 50 concurrently connected clients, with as low latency as possible lt15 ms would be nice.  This works fine until I set a break point on emoneem of the client apps connected to the server and then everything hangs  after maybe 25 seconds the service hangs and none of the other clients receive any data for about 30 seconds or so until the service registers a connection fault event and disconnects the offending client.  After this all the other clients continue on their merry way receiving messages.p  pIve done research on serviceThrottling, concurrency tweaking, setting threadpool minimum threads, WCF secret sauces and the whole 9 yards, but at the end of the day this article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc163537.aspxS10MSDN  WCF essentials, OneWay Calls, Callbacks and Eventsa  describes exactly the issue Im having without really making a recommendation.p  blockquote   pThe third solution that allows the service to safely call back to the client is to have the callback contract operations configured as oneway operations. Doing so enables the service to call back even when concurrency is set to singlethreaded, because there will not be any reply message to contend for the lock.p blockquote  pbut earlier in the article it describes the issue Im seeing, only from a client perspectivep  blockquote   pWhen oneway calls reach the service, they may not be dispatched all at once and may be queued up on the service side to be dispatched one at a time, all according to the service configured concurrency mode behavior and session mode. How many messages whether oneway or requestreply the service is willing to queue up is a product of the configured channel and the reliability mode. If the number of queued messages has exceeded the queues capacity, then the client will block, even when issuing a oneway callp blockquote  pI can only assume that the reverse is true, the number of queued messages to the client has exceeded the queue capacity and the threadpool is now filled with threads attempting to call this client that are now all blocked.p  pWhat is the right way to handle this Should I research a way to check how many messages are queued at the service communication layer per client and abort their connections after a certain limit is reached p  pIt almost seems that if the WCF service itself is blocking on a queue filling up then all the async  oneway  fireandforget strategies I could ever implement inside the service will still get blocked whenever one clients queue gets full.p

Negative 6828 pScenario Im running code on the client that connects to a server and uses a web service to retrieve data about a SharePoint list. Im using the Visual Studio 2010 service reference to get a web service for my SP Site and get my data from the list. It works. Now how do I go about coding it such that when I want to move from Test to Production, my web service calls will still work Note that the web service is a SharePoint web service, I did not write it. I am only using it. Is what I am suggesting possible I do have the ability to ensure that the Site is the exact same except for URLS on both environments e.g. backup the SP site and put it on production. Thanks for any suggestions.p  pstrongSummarystrongp  pBasically Im looking for the best way to go from test to production without recompiling my code which consumes the SP web service. Also, as a side note, if anyone knows how similar the testproduction sharepoint sites have to be, [in order for the web service to work on both without anything but the URL being changed].. that would be helpful info. p  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pThe project configuration file can be used to specify the web service location. The .svcdatamap and other files in the VS project are for design time use only, and the URL which is actually used to connect to the SharePoint web service is passed as an argument to the codeSystem.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContextcode object. This is only tangentially related, but to create your own WCF web service see this a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBXMLwsdldynamicurl.aspx relnofollowlinka. BTW, the web service will work without recompilation anywhere the SharePoint List has the same List name and the column youre querying has the same name.p

Negative 6828 pI am creating a timer solution.  User enters hrs, mins secs, into text boxes and then clicks button to start.  I wanted the timer to be small so it can be hidden at the top corner of the screen.  I have sized a background image to this size so it fits nicely in the small form.  However I also want the user to be able to maximise the form and take up the whole screen if they want.  However the image obviously stays at the original size.  Is there any possible way to avoid this i.e can i add an image which will be used if maximise is pressed.  Hopefully i have made sense with this question.p  pThanks  Collyp

Negative 6828 pI have an model which has a many to many relationship with itself.p  pI want to create a validation on the models which would prevent a group from being its own subgroup, or a subgroup of its subgroups, etc. The objective is to prevent a situation which can result in a loop  infinite recursion. p  pIve tried implementing this in the model clean method as shown below.p  pIve also tried implementing this in the model save method using transactions.  p  pIn both situations, Ive ended up in a situation where invalid changes are incorrectly saved to the database, but if I attempt to make further changes to either instance, the validations detect the error, but at that point, the bad data is already in the database.p  pIm wondering if this is possible, and if so, if its possible to do so in model validations so I dont have to make sure everyone on my team remembers to call these validations from all forms they create in the future.p  pWithout further delay, the codep  precodeclass Groupmodels.Model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength200     subgroups  models.ManyToManyFieldself, throughSubGroup, symmetricalFalse      def validatenogrouploopsself, seenNone         if seen is None             seen  []         if self.id in seen             raise ValidationErrorLOOP DETECTED         seen.appendself.id         for subgroup in self.target.all             subgroup.target.validatenogrouploopsseen       I thought I would use the standard validation mechanism in the clean      method, but it appears that when I recurse back to the group I started       with, I do so with a query to the database which retreives the data before      its been modified. Im still not 100 sure if this is the case, but      regardless, it does not work.     def cleanself         self.validatenogrouploops       Suspecting that the problem with implementing this in clean was that       I wasnt testing the data with the pending modifications due to the       repeated queries to the database, I thought that I could handle the      validation in save, let the save actually put the bad data into the      database, and then roll back the transaction if I detect a problem.      This also doesnt work.     def saveself, args, kwargs         superGroup, self.saveargs, kwargs         try             self.validatenogrouploops         except ValidationError as e             transaction.rollback             raise e         else             transaction.commit   class SubGroupmodels.Model     VERBS    ,        action  models.CharFieldmaxlength1, choicesVERBS.items, default     source  models.ForeignKeyGroup, relatednametarget     target  models.ForeignKeyGroup, relatednamesource codepre  pThanks ahead of time for any assistance you may provide.p  p[edit] FYI, If you couldnt tell based on the mechanism Im using to manage transactions, Im currently using django 1.2 because thats whats available in the fedora EPEL repository for RHEL6.

I want to use any design pattern to handle in an easy and uncluttered way the variety of choices.p  pThe report generation criteria is prepared as followsp  pstrongReport Type DropDown options includestrong p  blockquote   ol   liScheme Typewiseli   liSchemewiseli   liDistrictwiseli   liBlockwiseli   liAllli   ol blockquote  pBy default, only the first DropDown is enabled. Selecting an option from this DropDown, enables the respective DropDowns.p  pNot only this, values of codeSchemecode, codeDistrictcode and codeBlockcode DropDowns also change when an item is selected from any of these DropDowns or codeScheme Typecode DropDown using strongAJAXstrong.p  pIt involves a variety of SQL queries and EnablingDisabling DropDowns often. My present code has become cluttered with many codeIFcode and codeEndIfscode.p  pI want to know whether codeObserver patterncode or any approach using codeClassescode be used to simplify this operation. Any way to make this multiple selections and filling of DropDowns manageable and simplep  pstrongEdited below to clear requirementsstrongp  pLet me clarify further.p  pThe first DropDown is the key DropDown which is enabled by default when the page opens. All the other DropDowns are disabled by default. But this does not mean that Cascading DropDown is the correct choice because, the selection from the child DropDowns is random.p  pThe whole plan is to simplify the code in an understandable form for each DropDown. There are many Ifs and ElseIfs involved to pick the correct query depending upon the selection.p  pFor example The user selects, codeDistrictwise reportcode from the Report Type primary DropDown. In this case, three child DropDowns are enabled, viz.p  precodeScheme Type  Scheme  District codepre  pIf user selects ALL from Scheme Types List, all types of schemes in all categories gets filled in the Scheme DropDown. p  pIf user selects a particular Scheme Type from the options Urban, Rural or Other, the Scheme DropDown filters the name of the schemes.p  pNow, Scheme DropDown also has an option ALL. The user can select ALL or pick any particular scheme.p  pSame is with District. If ALL is selected, schemes in the Scheme DropDown takes all schemes in all districts, but if a particular district is selected, the Scheme DropDown must fill the filtered schemes of this district.p  pPlease note that in this case, we are now moving in a reverse order because District DropDown is again filtering the Scheme DropDown.p  pThe same is applicable with the Block DropDown.p  pThere are variety of conditions to be checked other the selected option. Suppose the user didnt select any option or the user selects ALL.p  pI want to create separate classes with the names of each DropDown. These classes should keep hearing notifications Observer for any changes in the DropDown.p  pI guess I was able to clarify.p

Negative 6828 pI attempted today to create a Python code to invert the colors of a .gif image using the Tkinter library. The code works and does exactly what I expected, but it takes about 50 seconds to run on a 3.4ghz processor. Im having trouble seeing what I could change to optimize this. Basically, I loop through every pixel in the image , grab the color values, convert them to a list of integers in order to manipulate them mathematically, invert each color value new color value  255  old color value, convert them back to a string so that PhotoImages put method can process them and rewrite the image, and finally display the inverted image. I cant think of what to change.

Negative 6828 pIve been working on a JS library and would like to setup a demo page on Github that allows, for example, users to define their own callbacks and execute commands. p  pI know codeevalcode is evil and I can see how blind codeevalcode of scripts could lead to XSS and other security issues. Im trying to cook up some alternative schemes.p  pI really enjoy the interactivity of jsFiddle.

Negative 6828 pCRM 2011 online. I have a requirement to color code entries that appear in an entity view. On a form for entity A is a field that is a lookup to entity B. Entity B has  1 views defined for it. The lookup field on form A defines what view of entity B appears when the lookup button is pressed. I have been asked if the view that appears can show the records such that the entries are color coded based on a column value of the view e.g. if a record in the view has a value of X for a particular column, show that record with a green background, else show with a red. The view in question is a public view and is unmanaged and customizable.p  pIn effect what I am asking is if its possible to manipulate the display of that view somehow If not, is the only other option to override the clicking of the lookup on the form for entity A and display my own custom view window p  pWhat I have found in my searching is a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarygg985383.aspx relnofollowthisa which seems to suggest that I can export a view and manipulate the XML to incorporate some kind of conditional formatting. However, all it tells me is that the value is a string. Anyone have any experience therep

Originally I had a simple many to many relationship between users and life was grand.p  pNow I need to track meta data on the relationship itself between the two users, e.gp  ul liwhen the relationship was requestedli liwhen it was acceptedli liwhen it endedli liif it ended, are there blocks to prevent this relationship being reopenedli lietc.li ul  pIve done a fair bit of research and it seems with Doctrine I cannot have meta data on the relations themselves because they are not entities. It was suggested I use a middle man object, so Users have a manytomany relationship with a Friendship object. The friendship object contains the meta dat and references to the two users.p  pNow onto my problem, if I have this friendship object how do I retrieve the other side of it Do I have a function which I pass the user I know so I get the other user One way Ive thought of implementing this is below, but it seems to me there should be another wayp  precodeuser  thisgtgetCurrentUser friends  array foreachusergtgetFriends as friendship      friends[]  friendshipgtnotuser  return the user we dont have  codepre  pand friendshipnot beingp  precodepublic function notuser      return thisgtuser1user  thisgtuser2  thisgtuser1  codepre

I mean, If the transactions finally rollsback, not to rollback also the row insertion for the email reporting the error details.p  pThis table can be read by multiple asyncronous process to send the mails in the queue, so in this scenario the rows have to be blocked to send only once the emails so is not possible to use a MyISAM table type and is using Innodb.p  pThanks in advance.p

The problem here is how to test it.p  pI tried to run that application in android emulator. there was no option to configure wifi in the settings menu, i also tired to enable wifi using the dev tools application form the emulator but it didnt work, And through all my googling over 3 days and i found that Android emulator is not supported the Wifi.p  pSo i opted for androidx86 4.0eeepc using virtual box and tired to add devices both wifi and bluetooth my app uses both bluetooth and wifi but only bluetooth device got added and it did not work. But my virtual box detected the wifi and bluetooth devices. I just couldnt get them work with the virtual machine.p  pI tried everything like manually adding the addresses using terminal emulator app in androidx86 and used codenetcfgcode through the android commandline but neither of them worked.p  pPlease suggest and guide me on the correct path to run these kind of applications that use wifi and bluetooth in android.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 6828 pI am computational scientist that work with large amount of simulation data and often times I find myself savingloading data intofrom the disk. For simple tasks, like a vector, this is usually as simple as dumping bunch of numbers into a file and thats it.p  pFor more complex stuff, life objects and such, I have saveload member functions. Now, Im not a emcomputer scientistem, and thus often times I see terminologies here on SO that I just do not understand but I love to. One of these that Ive came across recently is the subject of emserializationem and codeBoost.Serializationcode library. p  pFrom what I understand serialization is the simply the process of converting your objects into something that can be savedloaded from dist or be transmitted over a network and such. Considering that at most I need to saveload my objects intofrom disk, is there any reason I should switch from the simple loadsave functions into codeBoost.Serializationcode What would codeBoost.Serializationcode give me other than what Im already doingp

Negative 6828 pI have a service that is maintaining a socket connection to a game server.  The game needs frequent two way communication to the server, so this connection should be kept open as long as the app has the foreground.  However, since keeping the connection open is battery intensive wed like to be as nice as possible and as soon as the app leaves the foreground ie the user returns to the home screen we would kill the connection.p  pThis is all pretty close to working, but were running into a couple small irritations.  Whenever the game changes Activitys such as to the preference activity the connection drops.  Now we could have each activity drop the connection onPause and and start up the service responsible for this, but that seems less than optimal since it will cause unnecessary dropping and reconnecting.  Binding the service stop to the onStop method also seems way less than optimal since the connection will stay alive long after the user leaves the game.p  pWhat were looking for is a way to start up a service at some point soon after out initial activity starts and keep that service running as long as the application is in the foreground.  And as soon as the user leaves the application have the service shut down.  p

Negative 6828 pId like to use mongodb to distribute a cached database to some distributed worker nodes Ill be firing up in EC2 on demand. When a node goes up, a local copy of mongo should connect to a master copy of the database say, mongomaster.mycompany.com and pull down a fresh copy of the database. It should continue to replicate changes from the master until the node is shut down and released from the pool.p  pThe requirements are that the master need not know about each individual slave being fired up, nor should the slave have any knowledge of other nodes outside the master mongomaster.mycompany.com.p  pThe slave should be read only, the master will be the only node accepting writes and never from one of these ec2 nodes. p  pIve looked into replica sets, and this doesnt seem to be possible. Ive done something similar to this before with a masterslave setup, but it was unreliable. The masterslave replication was prone to sudden catastrophic failure.p

Negative 6828 blockquote   pThere are 2 machines on a network on which GUI is not installed to save the memory. Transfer a file from 1 such machine to another similar machine.p blockquote  pPossible methods I think could be 1. If we can the other computer on the network, we can put the items into a shared folder or making an existing one shared. 2. Using the ftp protocol on the command line and connecting to one of the machines acting as ftp server and downloading files from that using command get to download the file 3. Create a TCP connection across the two machines. One machine which is having the file will read it and write it to the socket and another one will read it from the socket.p  pCould there be more solutions for thisp

As you can see, I made some console outputs. If I click on button2, the output isp  pCanExecute called Execute called CanExecute called MyEventHandler calledp  pSo, in my eyes this is what happens 1. the command on the button is activated. To check if the execute method should be called, the CanExecute method is called. 2. If the CanExecute method returns true, then the Execute method is called. 3. Within the execute method, I defined, that the event CanExecuteChanged should be raised. Calling it will 1st check CanExecute and then call the eventhandler.p  pThis is not clear to me. The only way to call the event is within the Execute method. But the Execute method is called via Command logic after checking CanExecute. Calling the event also checks CanExecute, but why I am confused.p  pAnd things are getting more confused, when I try to disable the button. Lets say, there is a CommandParameter  and CanExecute now works with it. So it could be, that the method returns false. In this case the button is disabled  okay.p  pBut how do I reactivate it As we already know I can only raise the CanExecuteChange event from within my command class. So  as we are not able to click the disabled button  the command wont call CanExecute or even Execute method.p  pSeems to me there is something important I cant see  but i really cant find it p  pCould you please help me Thanks a lot CodeCannibalp

I am hosting an ftp server on my pc and I am making an app for it to connect to my server and download files. The problem with all the sample code is that everyone ASSUMES the server WILL be ONLINE. My pc may not be running 247 and I also may not have the ftp service running.In the first case it shouldnt even register that it is connected. In the second case, it WILL say that is connected bc the pc is on, but it will return that the machine ou are trying to connect to is actively refusing the connection.

Negative 6828 pDue to our requirements, we will have views and usecases that are deployment specific. Deployments will have generic and deployment specific parts beans. This means that we would probaly need one context.xml file that would contain the generic beans for all deployments, and then deployment specific deploymentContext.xml for each deployment. This means that some POJOs exists in one deplyment, but not the other.p  pMy questions 1 is it possible to have deployment specific context files to extend the generic context file 2 is it possible to describe a class in the deployment specific context file, that already exists in the generic context file I.e. It would override the bean described in the generic context file, as in class inheritance. 3 is the approach described above feasible, or should the build descriptor instead dynamically generate the context.xml file I would prefer the extension approach... 4 if I deploy all deployment specific contexts, but remove some of the POJO classes from the src directory, will the application break upon deployment or only after I try to instantiate the bean that does not existp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 6828 pRight now each of our web servers is allotted XGB RAM for memcached and its shared between them. My question is whether or not there is an inherent benefit in separating out caching to a separate server and connecting each web server to its memcached instance instead.p  pWere dealing with a lot of data that would not be able to fit all in cache easily. And wed like to be able to fit as much of our data into cache as possible, as the bottleneck for request time currently is querying the database servers. My thoughts are potentially a separate cache server could be loaded with extra RAM and hold more, without being a constraint on the web servers memory resources.p  pSorry if the question is kind of vague, I can provide more information if needed. I looked around some and couldnt see much on the issue regarding having a separate cache server that serves only that purpose.p

Negative 6828 pUsing a hrefhttpwww.xpathtester.com relnofollowthisa online XPath tester on the following XMLp  precodeltagtfoo lt[CDATA[ MyCData]]gt  bazltagt     codepre  pwith the XPath expression codeatextcode, I get back all the text p  precodefoo lt[CDATA[ MyCData]]gt  baz  codepre  pThis is structured as three nodes, as we can  see using codeatext[2]code , which returns codebazcode.p  pHowever, with  emjavax.xml.xpath.XPath,em the CData and the last text node are emnotem returned at all. I get a single node with codefoocode, and the remainder of the text codelt[CDATA[ MyCData]]gt  bazcode is just not available. Regardless of how XPath treats the XML structure, it is a bug if we cannot access nodes at all.p  pHowever, if I set emisCoalescingtrueem on the emDocumentBuilderFactoryem, it concatenates all the text and CData nodes into one.  I might end up using that, but it converts CData to escaped text in the output, which looks ugly, even if it is allowed by the standard. Also, I would prefer to be able to address the CData separately as some sort of node, whether just a text node, or else some special type of CData node.  p  pBy the way, if the CData is the emonlyem contents of its parent element, with no spaces or other text in front, an ordinary textcontent XPath retrieves it successfully, even with emisCoalescingem at its default emfalseem. So, we see that the Java XPath is always returning the first, and only the first, text node.p  pWhen I examine the full DOM tree of my DOM Document, with emisCoalescingem at its default, I find that the CData  section is represented as its own node of type emcdatasectionem, which is great, but how can I access this node in XPathp

How do I solve this problem without breaking MVVM p  pEdit Id also like to hear any recommendations if its actually worth keeping this pattern for problems like this. Lately, I feel like MVVM is giving me more problems than solutions.p  pEdit2 Ohh.. Ok, this problem was a lot more convoluted than I thought. From Florian Gls suggestion, I went ahead and created an event in my viewmodel, then handled that event in my view to call designerCanvas.InvalidateMeasure.p  pThis calls my MeasureOverride method in DesignerCanvas. Except it doesnt adjust my canvas size properly, so scrollviewer still doesnt work. Ive noticed that Im not adding shapes directly to the children of the DesignerCanvas but rather, to the observablecollection which is databound to the Canvas.

Negative 6828 pThis likely isnt possible, but I thought I would ask just to be sure.  I have a batch file which starts my java app using relative paths.  Ie. i havep  pApplicationstart.bat Applicationlib.jarp  pMy application creates a configuration file in the Application directory.  My batch script uses relative paths to point to the lib directory jars.  This has worked really well for me because I can move the program wherever I want and it will just run.  However now I would like to be able to call the same app from command line as well not just from a shortcut which has the working directory set to Application.  The problem is that I want to be able to call my application from any directory on the command line and right now this doesnt work because the working directory will be different.p  pI know I can always add another parameter to my app for the working directory but then I still have to create a batch script with a hard coded path to my application.  Is there any way around this in Java, for example to get the directory that my main java file is in on top of the working directory Is there a launcher app perhapsp  pI cant bundle my app as a jar because it creates configuration files which I want to be in the same directory as the application.p

Negative 6828 pI am building a mobile web app that uses jQuery and hammer.js for touch controls. hammer.js has a feature called preventdefault which turns off Safaris scrollingzoomingprettymucheverything. I have a page with a form using lt input  for text fields, and a javascript listener that calls .focus when you tap the form.p  pThis all works well up until a point. The page is fixed in place and looks real pretty, and when you click on a form field it zooms in and the iOS keyboard appears. The problem is that when the user is done entering text, there is no way to zoom out. The browser is so zoomed in from .focus that the browser bar is gone and you have to close the browser tab and retype in the URL instead of refreshing.p  pI am looking for a way to force the browser to zoom out back to the initial view. Ive looked all over the internet for some solution but have yet to find anything.p  pI have the viewport meta tags in the header to disable zooming from the beginning, but is not useful in solving this issuep

Negative 6828 pIm using nuget as many of you a lot for referencing external and internal componentassemblies.br For debugging purposes, it would be nice being able to exchange the nugetassembly for its sourcecode.br Unfortunately, some corelib is used pretty often by the solution itself and also some nugetreferenced packages used by the sln. Simply removing the reference via VS and adding its sourceproject often causes an ambigous relation to the corelib, because both sln and packagesrc use the corelib  mostly in different versions.br The only way I know to solve that issue is to update all references to the same version usually, the most actual one. That can be pretty annoying, especially in bigger projects.br Maybe there exists a way to make referencing more flexible  e.g. by using wildcards in the hintpath  p  pThanks for all suggestionsp

Negative 6828 pMy app is needing the ability to get multiple images from a web server  directory i.e. www.somedomain.comimages. The number of images will never be the same, and I will not have access to the names of the files because they will also never be the same. The end result Im looking for is to give my client the ability to just access her sub directory through her ftp client and just drop images into the specified folder without having to name the images a certain name, write any xml files, or any other steps beyond dragging the images into the folder. Then my clients users that log into the app will be able to get the images that my client has placed into that directory. I have been looking into Apples simpleFTPsample project to get access via FTP. I just want to know if there are any other simpler options One reason being simpleFTPsample style requires an FTP username and password to access those files. Im not 100 sure if it is safe to place the user and pass within the app. Any suggestions or samples would be great thanks.p

If you do, I my script Ive done a system that checks if you are logged in, if you arent it ask you to login and then the system checks if the app has the publish permissions and if not it ask you. If all theses if are true it posts a message to your wall straight. So hopefully the asking part needs to be done only once. p  pemThe problemem p  pWhen the ipad swap between the game and the facebook app to login, the ipad shutdown the game for saving memory. Ive tried to reduce the scene, but its hard to reduce it more than it is. So I thought maybe I should open that facebook login and authorisation inGame. For that Im using this linep  psetSessionLoginBehaviorFacebookSessionLoginBehavior.ForcingWebViewp  pAnd it does exactly what I want, doesnt crash all good really. But the problem is that it only works for the login, and when I ask the publish permission it switches to the facebook app to ask the permission and therefore crashes.p  pSo how can I ask the permission in the same way of the FacebookSessionLoginBehavior.ForcingWebView.p  pThanks a lot for the help.p  pBorisp

Negative 6828 pIm having a very strange issue in my java application. Im building it with maven and developing it in Eclipse IDE. This might be a bit lengthy explanation but please stick to the end of it, cause the problem is really strange and I have no clue what can be the cause of it.p  pHeres an example of code Im writingp  pSuppose we have a Handler interface. It can handle a specific object typep  precodepublic interface HandlerltTgt      public void handleT obj  codepre  pNow lets say we want to have Handler chaining. We could do it like thisp  precodepublic class HandlerChainltTgt implements HandlerltTgt   private Handlerlt super Tgt h  Override public void handleT obj              h can handle T objects     h.handleobj     private HandlerChainHandlerlt super Tgt h      super     this.h  h       syntax sugar to start the chain public static ltTgt HandlerChainltTgt startHandlerlt super Tgt h     return new HandlerChainltTgth             add another handler to the chain public HandlerChainltTgt nextfinal Handlerlt super Tgt handler     return new HandlerChainltTgtnew HandlerltTgt          Override         public void handleT obj              h.handleobj             handler.handleobj                                       codepre  pNow lets make some handler factories for, say, String handlersp  precode public class Handlers  public static HandlerltStringgt h1     return new HandlerltStringgt          Override         public void handleString obj               do something                   public static HandlerltStringgt h2     return new HandlerltStringgt          Override         public void handleString obj               do something                   codepre  pSo finally we make a class that handles some Strings using the two handlers in a chainp  precodepublic class Test   public void doHandleString obj     HandlerChain.startHandlers.h1.nextHandlers.h2.handleobj   codepre  pSo, to me there seemed nothing wrong with this code.

This alone works fine but I now want to set the initial values and their selected value.p  pSince I subscribe to a change in the first dropdown box to load the second dropdown box I am not only loading the data twice now, I also loose my initial selection in the second dropdown box.

Negative 6828 pAll, It was the the first time I met this kind of problem, When I installed the jdk 1.7, there is no problem found in this process. After that , I try to verify the version of the jdk . so I run the codejavacode command in the dos window. But got the result says codejava is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch filecode. Can anybody tell me why and what happen thanks.p
Negative 6828 pI am trying to make a filter for a searchfield where a number of checkboxes can be checked to choose what people want to search. I am currently trying to do this with the CheckGroup component but as I do not have a submit button I do not know how I can retrieve the latest checked objects. One thought of doing it was using Javascript, to call a function in Javascript and retrieve all the checkboxes like that. I currently have the following code in Wicket. So my question would be how to do this and if it is possible to not do this with Javascript.

Negative 6828 pWell, Ive been given a number of pairs of elements codes,hcode, where codescode sends an codehcode element on the codescodeth row of a 2d array.It is not necessary that each line has the same amount of elements, only known that there cannot be more than N elements on a line.p  pWhat I want to do is to find the lowest biggest difference between a certain element of the first line and the rest ones.p  pThus, if I have 3 lines with code101,92 100,25,95,52,101 93,108,0,65,200code what I want to find is 3, because I have to choose 92 and I have 95923 from first to second and 93921 form first to third.p  pI have reached a point where it is certain that if I have codescode lines with codenicode elements each and codei0..scode, then coden0ltn1lt...ltnscode so as to have a good average performance scenario when picking the bestfit from 1st line towards the others.p  pHowever, I cannot think of a way lower than Onsup2sup or even maybe Onsup3sup in some cases. Does anyone have a suggestion about a fairly improved way to do thisp

Negative 6828 pI dont even know whether this is possible, however, I am hoping that JavaScript could provide a solution to this problem. I have a DIV, that shows the title for each page within a WordPress template that I am working on. p  precodeltdiv classgridblock idpagegt    ltdiv idpageinfogt      lth3gtltphp ishome  bloginfodescription  wptitle,true gtlth3gt    ltdivgtlt pageinfo gt  ltdivgtlt .gridblock page gt codepre  pThe text that is called into the DIV comes in at various lengths, and sometimes overexceeds the DIV. When the text exceeds the DIV, it wraps, just as it should, however, I am attempting to adjust the height of this DIV, after a word is wrapped. I do not know if I could add some type of eventListener or something, however, pure HTML andor CSS does not seem to have the components I need to solve this problem.p  pIn addition, I understand that I could use media media queries to sort of emulate this effect, however, as far as I know, this can only be done in relation to the width of the Window, and I want the DIV to resize only when a string exceeds the width of this DIV. A demo of what I am attempting to do can be found at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjustinbyrne001SP3Q24 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netjustinbyrne001SP3Q24a. I appreciate any comments, recommendations, and advice that anyone has regarding this matter. Thanks in advance.p

At the moment I am struggling to find the right moment when the map and especially custom controls are rendered, so I can load the first data feed. The custom controls need to be shown, because the one representing one of several feeds gets highlighted.p  pI have read about google.maps.event.addListenerOnce and events idle and tilesLoaded, but none of these seem to work at the moment.p  pThe mashup, as far as I have come, can be found herep  pa hrefhttpwww.oefiles.degmapseqmashupng.html relnofollowhttpwww.oefiles.degmapseqmashupng.htmlap  pClicking on one of the feed selectors bottom right will load the feeds, once the page is loaded.

Negative 6828 pHello Backbone ninjas,p  pThis is my first time using Backbone  so please excuse my noobness.  In my functionality part of a larger app,I have a Backbone View vA, backed by a model mA as it should be  and the server side is in Spring MVC having annotated Spring controller methods with RequestBody and ResponseBody. Ive got Jackson working fine with Spring.p  pNow, in the app, p  precodeBackbone.Model   BaseModel custom base model for our app     mA my model codepre  pmA has its own endpoint and it Backbone sucessfully calls that when making a PUT request i.e., when I call save from a submit button event handler from View vA like sop  pthis.model.savep  precode            success  function                      alertRequest submitted successfully               ,              error  function                 alertSomething awful happened.              codepre  pp  pOur BaseModel has the followingp  precodedefine[], function     window.BaseModel  Backbone.Model.extend  ......     onSyncError  functionmodel, response          switch response.status          case 403         [...some more code ]         default             alertbundle.getDefaultHTTPRESPOTH  response.status              ,      onSyncSuccess  functionmodel, response          alertSync done      ,      sync  functionmethod, model, options          options.error  this.onSyncError         Backbone.sync.callthis, method, model, options         ....some more stuff.           ,   codepre  pSpring controller methodp  precodeRequestMappingvalueresourcexyzid.json, method  RequestMethod.PUT, consumes      applicationjson , produces  applicationjson ResponseBody public MapltString,Stringgt methodXRequestBody XyzDTO  xyzDTO .... map.putmsg, success  return map  codepre  pAlso, right before I make the save call, I modify a few Model attributes, since the server side DTO has a different structure like sop  precodethis.model.unsetabc, silent true  this.model.set  abc id  2,xyz ... more code    codepre  pThe issue is, calling save generates a PUT request and successfully calls the Spring endpoint handler, but I get a response code 200 which is what I expect, but when I trace the call with Firebug, it goes into the onSyncError method and gives me an error message because of the default case in it.p  pThe Backbone doc says  When returning a JSON response, send down the attributes of the model that have been changed by the server, and need to be updated on the client. Well, I dont need to update the model on the client side, its one of the last screens and I just need to tell the user of a success  error and  redirect him to a main pagedashboard. p  pI read up some more, and it seems code 200 as response is not sufficient  there might be JSON parsing errors causing the sync to fail.p  pI checked the response in Firebug, and the response JSON looks like msgSuccess. p  pSo, what could be going wrongp

Negative 6828 pI have a WebBrowser control showing a Silverlight application. This control is in a WPF application. Obviously this is a bit of a hack to integrate Silverlight with WPF as ultimately neither one knows about each other, theyre completely independent.p  pSo what I need is for Silverlight to post a value into the WPF application. What I was thinking was using JavaScript hosted in the .aspx page in the Silverlight application which can be accessed from both Silverlight and WPF. I think it is fairly simple getting data from Silverlight to the .aspx page but Im not sure how to get the data from the .aspx page to WPF. Ideally I dont want WPF to have to call for the data, I want it to be posted from Silverlight and appear in the WPF application without WPF having to do anything except receive and display the data.p  pHmm...hope that makes sense.p

Negative 6828 h1Some backgroundh1  pIm working on an iOS app where we want the state of the application to be preserved.br Before this app is out, iOS 7 is likely to have been released or is soon to be released and the majority seems to have moved away from iOS 5. We have therefore decided to develop for iOS 6 an onwards.p  pIn iOS 6 there are some really nice functionality for preserving state. Just give all views in the storyboard unique IDs and implement these two functions in the AppDelegatep  precode BOOLapplicationUIApplicationapplication shouldSaveApplicationStateNSCodercoder  BOOLapplicationUIApplicationapplication shouldRestoreApplicationStateNSCodercoder codepre  piOS will then automagically preserve the navigation history of the app. The methodsp  precode voidencodeRestorableStateWithCoderNSCodercoder  voiddecodeRestorableStateWithCoderNSCodercoder codepre  pcan then be used to store and retrieve data.br No problems there it works without issues. But, the methods that save the state are only triggered when the app entered the background.  p  pLets say we have one NavigationController with four ViewControllers A, B, C and D. The user navigates from A to B, in B he switches over to Safari to google something. The application state is saved in B. The user then switches back to the app and navigates on to C and then to D. In D the app unfortunately encounters an exception and goes down. When the user restarts the app, iOS will try to restore the saved state. This state however, was saved in B. Which means that when the app launches, it doesnt start from the beginning, not where the user left it D and not even the previous view C but in B.  p  h1A possible solutionh1  pThe above scenario could be avoided if the app saved its state at every new view. However there arent as far as I know any public methods to trigger the state preservation process. I have examined the call stack while debugging and found out that iOS calls the following method on the UIApplication object in iOS 6p  precodesaveApplicationPreservationState codepre  pand the following method in iOS 7p  precodesaveApplicationPreservationStateviewControllersessionIdentifierbeginHandlercompletionHandler codepre  pThere also seems to be another method that calls one of the above depending on the iOS versionp  precodesaveApplicationPreservationStateIfSupported codepre  pBy invoking this method like thisp  precode    if [[UIApplication sharedApplication] respondsToSelectorselectorsaveApplicationPreservationStateIfSupported]         [[UIApplication sharedApplication] performSelectorselectorsaveApplicationPreservationStateIfSupported] codepre  pI can see that the expected methods are called.p  h1The actual questionh1  pIf I would go with the above solution could that get my app rejected from the App Store I mean technically its not a private method, its just not exposed. By wrapping the call in respondsToSelector the app wont crash if the APIs are changed, it just wont save the state as often. But if it could get the app rejected its not an option. Or is there any other way to manually invoke the state preservation process other than the one described above I would be nice to be able to use the builtin functionality rather than building a custom solution that saves the state to codeNSUserDefaultscode.p
Negative 6828 pI am creating tables in hive for a spatialdatabase, I know there are special indexes for spatial data, which are Rtree. In hive create a spatial index is not possible i think. I was thinking about trying to make a index of x, y long, lat, continuous variables with decimals.

The IP it gave was correct, I can paste it into the browser URL box and our site comes up. But I want to make sure this is the valid Macoy, becausep  p2 However, in Azure dash, if I select my web role, if I select Manage Domains, curiously, it says the following THE IP ADDRESS TO USE WHEN YOU CONFIGURE A RECORDS NNN.NN.NN.NNN real number is given, which DIFFERS from the one discovered above, even though interestingly the first 3 numbers NNN match, and the second number NN is only 1 digit different e.g. 36 instead of 35. p  pWhy would this be And also, that IP address does emnotem work when I paste in the browser url box. p  pSo while I could given the IP address from 1, I just feel insecure about why the only IP address I can find for our site in the Azure panel itself doesnt work and is different. I do not want the one this external website found to be somehow incidental or not the real one to use.p  pP.S.

Negative 6828 pEDIT  Here is a more complete set of code that shows exactly whats going on per the answer below.p  precodelibname output datafilesjeff let DateStart  01Jan2013d let DateEnd  01Jun2013d proc sql CREATE TABLE output.id AS    SELECT DISTINCT id   FROM mydb.salevolume AS sv   WHERE sv.category IN a, b, c AND     sv.transdate BETWEEN ampDateStart AND ampDateEnd  CREATE TABLE output.sums AS    SELECT id, SUMsales   FROM mydb.salevolue AS sv   INNER JOIN output.id AS ids     ON ids.id  sv.id   WHERE sv.transdate BETWEEN ampDateStart AND ampDateEnd   GROUP BY id  run codepre  pThe goal is to simply query the table for some ids based on category membership.  Then I sum these members activity across all categories.p  pThe above approach is far slower thanp  ol liRunning the first query to get the subsetli liRunning a second query the sums every IDli liRunning a third query that inner joins the two result sets.li ol  pIf Im understanding correctly, it may be more efficient to make sure that all of my code is completely passed through rather than crossloading.p  hr  pAfter posting a question yesterday, a member suggested I might benefit from asking a separate question on performance that was more specific to my situation.  p  pIm using SAS Enterprise Guide to write some programsdata queries.  I dont have permissions to modify the underlying data, which is stored in Teradata.  p  pMy basic problem is writing efficient SQL queries in this environment.  For example, I query a large table with tens of millions of records for a small subset of IDs.  Then, I use this subset to query the larger table againp  precodeproc sql CREATE TABLE subset AS    SELECT     id   FROM     bigTable   WHERE     someValue  x AND     date BETWEEN a AND b   codepre  pThis works in a matter of seconds and returns 90k IDs.  Next, I want to query this set of IDs against the big table, and problems ensue.  Im wanting to sum values over time for the IDsp  precodeproc sql CREATE TABLE subsetdata AS    SELECT     bigTable.id,     SUMbigTable.value AS total   FROM     bigTable   INNER JOIN subset     ON subset.id  bigTable.id   WHERE     bigTable.date BETWEEN a AND b   GROUP BY     bigTable.id  codepre  pFor whatever reason, this takes a really long time.  The difference is that the first query flags someValue.  The second looks at all activity, regardless of whats in someValue.  For example, I could flag every customer who orders a pizza.  Then I would look at every purchase for all customers who ordered pizza.p  pIm not overly familiar with SAS so Im looking for any advice on how to do this more efficiently or speed things up.  Im open to any thoughts or suggestions and please let me know if I can offer more detail.  I guess Im just surprised the second query takes so  long to process.p

Negative 6828 pI am setting up tests that use Jasmine and Karma to test my JavaScript.

However, I have another library that is still making AJAX requests.p

Negative 6828 pI have an Ajax tab container that contains two tab panels which in turn contain two update panels with forms elements in them.

This then generates an error because several elements are named the same.p  pDoes anyone know how to prevent thisp  pI use Visual Studio 2012 and .NET 4.5p  pThank you.p

Negative 6828 pMy program runs with errors and I really have no idea why, will you help me please The question is as belowp  blockquote   pThe flow problem is classic example of viscous diffusion. The governing equation for such problem was derived using boundary layer theory to reduce the full Navier Stokes equations to the single parabolic PDE.   with the necessary initial and boundary conditions,p      pt  0 u0  0, u0.04m  0p      pt  0 u0  40.0, u0.04m  U  0.0ms.p      pThis problem may be described physically as transient viscousdriven flow between two plates of infinite extent and separated by a distance of 0.04m. Initially both plates are at rest. After time,t0, the upper plate is set in motion in the positive xdirection with a velocity of 40.0ms. Due to the viscosity of the fluid filling the space between the plates, successive lamina of fluid are set in motion as time elapses. Eventually, the system reaches a quasisteady state, as the velocity profile becomes more or less constant in time.

Negative 6828 pI am working on an android project and wanted to integrate FB into it. p  pUsing the FB SDK tutorial, I imported the FB SDK into my workspace along with a sample project.

Ive found it hard to pinpoint the problem, but I have two components that both simply move a circles xposition using p  precodex  floatgameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds  10 codepre  pHowever, when using codeTaskscode, their xpositions very quickly become disparate from one another, when they should in fact be the same. Each codeengineComponent.UpdategameTimecode is called once perupdate cycle, and the same codegameTimecode object is passed.p  pWhen using codetasks[i].RunSynchronouslycode in place of codetasks[i].Startcode, the program runs exactly as expected.p  pI understand that using Tasks in this manner may not be a particularly efficient programming practice, so my question is one of curiosity why isnt the above code working as I would expect I know Im missing something obvious, but Ive been unable to track down what specifically is wrong with this implementation.p  pApologies for the long question, and thanks for reading p

Negative 6828 pIm tasked with creating a serviceoriented ecosystem for a client. The whole thing is going to be REST based and built in ASP.NET, but my question is technologyagnostic. We want to have a centralized authentication service that issues JWT tokens and claims that are trusted by the other services in the environment. p  pMy issue is this  whats the first thing that a web client browser requests All of the diagrams Ive seen Ill try to add a couple of example links make it seems as if the client needs to be selfaware and realize that theyre going to need a token before they make the first request to the functional REST service, which seems, well, janky to me. p  pThe way I want it to work is that they just attempt to access the secured resource, but theres no auth token with the request my REST service challenge them for userpassword, but then delegate the authentication to my auth service. Sop  ol liBrowser requests restricted resource on REST serviceli liREST service returns 401li liBrowser gathers credentials, sends to same web serviceli liREST service connects to the authentication service, passing along the Auth header from the clients requestli liAuth service creates the JWT token and returns it to the REST serviceli liREST service validates the JWT and replaces the Auth header with the JWT tokenli liJWT token is persisted for subsequent requests, up to expy settingli ol  p...am I completely off about this Does the web client need to know that theres a separate auth service involved and make one request there to get their JWT, and then a second request for the REST resource passing the JWT That seems clunky to me, I hope thats not the idea.p  pAlso, another n00b question  is the JWT token automagically kept by the web clients and resent with every request so I dont have to go through the auth service step each time Is that what the expiration setting is forp  pTIA.p  pSee figure 1 here for an example of what I mean a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh446531.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh446531.aspxa p

Negative 6828 pI am new to C. I am working on a problem from class. We must use Dynamic Arrays to read words from a file.p  pHere are my simple questions.p  ol liDoes Dynamic Array imply the use of a pointer Meaning we point at our new array made.li liIn Java, ArrayList can be created and size changes dynamically. But to me in C, does using a dynamic array mean to set the size of the array to a large number and then dynamically allocate that arrayli liIs there no way to chop off the excess indexes from the dynamic array So then delete the array at the end is the only choice I have in Cli ol  pThanks, pointers and dynamic arrays can only be used. Thank you.p

Negative 6828 pI am using VS 2010 C Express to develop win32 apps on a 64bit PC running 64bit Win 7.p  pOccasionally, when trying to run an app in debug, the fopen function will return null values for all of the fields of FILE fin.  What is interesting is that, when this problem occurs, it occurs in ALL of my VS 2010 C Express projects  including those that previously have run properly in IDE without any intervening changes to the source code or to project settings.  p  pI.e., it is the IDE that appears to be misbehaving  not my projects that suddenly decided in concert to malfunction and then fix themselves. p  pThis problem has occurred twice before.  The problem persisted thru a series of the following actionsp  p1  Closing and reopening the IDE, p  p2  Restarting my PC, p  p3  Recreating the project, p  p4  Removing, redownloading and reinstalling VS 2010 C Express.p  pThe problem was observed to be present after each of these actions.  Finally, a few days after it manifested the problem disappeared as mysteriously as it appeared. p  pI have visited the answered questions on StackOverflow that are relevant to this issue. None of these address this specific problem.  p  pHas anyone else experienced this problem and had similar suspicionsp  pAlso, can anyone recommend a good alternative and free C compiler other than something from Microsoftp

Negative 6828 pIm using a large array of objects built around a center point in a scene, and need to manipulate them all around their local axis. They are all facing the origin using a blank object and lookAt, then I used a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14250208threejshowtorotateanobjecttolookatonepointandorienttowardsanothethis method to align the other axes correctlya. Getting the initial rotation this way worked great, unfortunately when I try to rotate these objects on the fly with codeobject.rotation.x  ltamountgtcode, it does not respect the local axis of the object. p  pThe confusing part is, its not even using the global axis, the axis its using almost seems entirely arbitrary. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nethLgAz1 relnofollowI set up a JSFiddle to demonstrate this herea. As you can see on line 129, codelooker.rotation.zcode works correctly, it rotates along the Z axis properly, but if its changed to X or Y, it doesnt rotate along local or global axes. If anyone could demystify what is happening to cause this, that would be great.p

Negative 6828 pI am writing a plugin for wordpress and use a table layout in the widget wrapper to display rankings and game schedules.  One row with all the information given uses about 1000px in width.

Negative 6828 pIve been able to build the static libraries for assimp on iOS using this a hrefhttpsgithub.comblandinwassimptreeiosxcode46 relnofollowbrancha of assimp. Now that I have the specific libraries for armv7, armv7s, arm64 and i386for the simulator, how should I include them into my project. In xcode, there is the section for other linker flags, which also has two sections, debug and release and each of those has two sections for simulator and ios sdks. In the simulator Ive put the path to the i386 architecture for both debug and release. p  pFor the iOS sdk, this is where Im having one of my problems. Each time I put one of the static libraries, it tells me that its ignoring the static library as Im linking against a file that was built for archive which is not the architecture being linked armv7s. So I try the armv7s static library and it tells me again that its ignoring that because of the same thing except armv7. So I tried to put all of the libraries and it doesnt work. Im sure that there are so many things Im missing but Im not sure what to do. Ive tried different deployments, different architectures. Id appreciate any help. p  pEditp  pSo I was able to fix it by just changing the valid architectures from armv7, armv7s, arm64, to just armv7. By including the armv7 version of the static library it now works. However, Id like to know how to build towards multiple targets. Is this possible Does it take place when building assimp Can I put a static library for each version of the library When I try to specifically address a target in Linker flags, for instance armv7, it also has a  Any iOS sdk at the end.

Negative 6828 pHopefully this will make some sense ..p  pWe have a bunch of database projects that we use to maintain schema and generate upgrade scripts. To generate the upgrade scripts, we use an automated build engine which uses SqlPackage.exe to compare the database project with a schema template, which is a copy of the live database, but with no data.p  pOne of these databases has references to three of the other database projects.p  pRecently, weve found that when the upgrade script is generated for this database project, it includes refactoring SQL for tables that are in one of the references project, and not in the project in question.p  pSo the upgrade script includes two lots of SQLp  ol liPrint statements at the start saying that a schema object will not be renamed.li liA bunch of insert statements into RefactorLog.li ol  pThe problem is twofoldp  ol liThese refactors should not be included in this upgrade script they belong to one of the referenced database project  they have nothing to do with this one.li liBecause this database does not require refactoring, it has no table called RefactorLog because they upgrade script doesnt need to create it.

Negative 6828 pI have a strange heisenbug which appears in x86 Release mode under VC11 C.  Unfortunately I wasnt able to come up with a minimal example which still has the bug, however here is one that works finep  precodeinclude stdafx.h  lt nothing special in here include ltvectorgt  class MyClass      stdvectorltdoublegt myVec public     void initint m          myVec  stdvectorltdoublegtm  3        int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      MyClass x  1     x.init1  2  codepre  pNow in 1 I create a an instance of MyClass where myVec should be default constructed as empty vector.  In 2 I call init which changes the value of myVec, see 3.  There I get somethimes an error.p  pThe error is always an heap error during deallocation of the original content of myVec.  It seems like myVec does not contain any memory but it tries to free it anyway.  However, the error occours only in Release mode, not always like in 80 of the cases, despite the fact that the algorithm runs always on the same data and has no random elements, and it occours never while stepping through the program with the debugger it is actually enough to have a break point in this line and always press F5 to continue.p  pI could fix the problem by usingp  precode    myVec.resize0     myVec.resizem codepre  pinstead of 3.  But what I now fear is that I still have a bug somewhere in my program that caused undefined behaviour and for that reason myVec was not properly constructed or at least somehow came in inproper state.  I have just no clue how such a bug could look like and where to start looking for it.p  pHas anyone have had some similar problem before and an idea how to systematically find the cause of error  I know its hard to make a remote diagnostics in this case but any help would be appreciated.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI installed Application Verifier and during this found out how to use WinDbg from Visual Studio  really cool to have a debugger one can talk to  .  Unfortunately it only told me that I try to release memory at a place where no memory is allocated at the moment and that the address where this happens changes from run to run.  But I couldnt find out why this happens.p  pI then started to carefully review my code and by the way did a refartoring of the project.  When I was done the error did not appear anymore.  I didnt change the algorithms only reorganized them a little bit.  I let a coworker view over the parts I changed and he couldnt see a mistake either, neither in the refactored version nor in the original version.p  pThen I rolled my source code back to the version before the refactoring and the error was gone there, too.  Im really confused about this  Ive only my source checked in and no binaries and object files.  Right now, my two best guesses arebr  either the error is still there just randomly now without symtomsbr  or there went something wrong during building, maybe involving some issues with external libraries, what for some reason does not happen anymore.p  pI will now go on working on my project and hope either the error appears again and I can finde the cause or it will keep silent for ever and ever.p

Negative 6828 pI am new to parallelization and MPI. I am learning and experimenting with mpi4py. Currently I am trying to optimize the performance of a method which randomly samples for a desired pointsatisfying a condition in an interval.p  pTo give you a detailed idea, i created a sample program which is similar to my program. The aim of this program is to output 20 numbers between 9.9999 and 10.0. This is done by randomly sampling from [0.0,1.0] and multiplying it by 10varies by iteration by a infinitesimally small amount.p  pThe following is the function and comments are provided.p  precodeimport numpy as np import time  def fititerations, value         array  []         sample  None          This runs for a fixed number of iterations. For one iteration one sample needs to go to the accumulator array in this case i.e array         for iteration in rangeiterations             while True                 arbit  np.random.uniform0,1                  The main condition for sampling. In my original program this is bound to change with each                  iteration. so I made it depend on the iteration in this test program.                 if100.000001iterationarbit gt value                     sample  10arbit                     break              The accumulation of accepted sample. If there are n iterations, n samples are expected.              array.appendsample          print Result  strarray  if name  main             startTime  time.time             fit20, 9.9999             elapsedTime  time.time  startTime             print ntime taken strelapsedTimen codepre  pAs you can see all the action happens in the while loop in the fit method. What I want to do is to take advantage of parallelization and mpi4py to make this method faster. For example, I want to start n processes and when the while loop comes the processes are fired parallely and which ever one finds the desired value first I want to take that value add it to accumulator array and abort all other processes. I want to continue this routine again in the next iteration and so on until the method finishes. Is something like this possible  If not this way, What other way can I use parallelization in the above function p  pThanks    p

The call stack is completely empty except for the memcpy function, and the local variables are listed but it does not have values for any of them.p  pIt happens occasionally on any computer.p  pIt does not ALWAYS happen under any known condition, but it only ever happens under a few conditions.  In particular it only happens when a particular type of object is destroyed, although thats not necessarily the direct cause, and investigating the destruction process has not been helpful.p  pA little more about the project It is a game using SFML 2.0, linked statically.

Negative 6828 pHi all,p  pnbspnbspnbspnbspI have some code generating a dynamically filled QMenu depending on some data I will call it thisMenu. The QMenu thisMenu is created, taking some main QWidget as parent and is added to a QMenuBar within this QWidget menuBar.addMenuthisMenu. Latter on, I want the user to be able of accessing thisMenu from a context menu the user right click on some portion of the QWidget, which pops a QMenu called contextMenu with some actions, and the previous QMenu as a submenu.p  pnbspnbspnbspnbspIf I reuse the QMenu that I first created with contextMenu.addMenuthisMenu I find out that, even if contextMenu pops at the right global position, thisMenu is always translated to some other position and appearing sometimes above, sometimes under contextMenu.p  pnbspnbspnbspnbspI can test that this is linked to the parenting chain  thisMenu is not a child of contextMenu, if I create it a child of contextMenu, everything is fine. Is there a way of cleanly handling this case without recreating a QMenu similar to thisMenu, or changing the parent of thisMenu i.e. reusing thisMenu in both QMenuBar and in some context menuQMenu In other what is the proper way of handling parenting chain for QMenu and sharing QMenup  pnbspnbspnbspnbspThank you,p

Negative 6828 pI may be coming from a different mindset, being primarily a C programmer. This question has to do with OOP in Python and more specifically pure virtual methods.

Now my problem is that emduck typingem is all good and I think I have grasped it. However, is it wrong to pursue more strict OOP in Python So I looked at the a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2libraryabc.html relnofollowAbstract Base Classesa and specifically a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2libraryabc.htmlabc.abstractmethod relnofollowabstractmethoda. To me all this seems to do is allow me to call the base class method with super. Is there any wayreasonin Python to make codespeakcode pure such that implementing a derived animal without speak would throw an errorp  pMy argument for such a pursuit would be when writing modules and frameworks that you intend people to subclass, this would self document for them the fact that they need implement the function. A probably very bad idea is something like this, having the base class pure function throw an exception. Problem is that this error is found at runtimep  precodeclass VirtualExceptionBaseException     def initself, type, func         BaseExceptionself  class Animal     def speakself         raise VirtualException  class CatAnimal     def speakself         printmeow  class DogAnimal     def speakself         printwoof  class WildebeestAnimal     def function2self         printWhat  mypets  [Dog, Cat, Dog, Wildebeest]  for pet in mypets     pet.speak codepre

Negative 6828 pI have trouble rendering a custom GTK3 drawing area with custom cairo code. It seems that the cairo context doesnt want to trouble with the shape I specify.  It writes the whole source onto the whole destination, regardless of the shape.p  pSo for example, if I set a fully white source area to paint a small white rectangle, and I ask cairo to codefillcode that rectangle, it paints the whole DrawingArea widget instead of that rectangle.

Negative 6828 pWhile practicing wanted to create basic gamekindof  there is just a basic shape rectangle and you move forward with one button, move backwards with another, and rotate it with 2 additional buttons, that shape as well should move to other direction accordingly to its rotation.

And I think thats it, other code isnt worth mentioning.  In my opinion this should work, but the thing is while movement direction is changin at normal speed, my rectangle is spinning wildly, probably about 100 times or so faster than its movement direction.p  pDelta is the number of milliseconds since the last call to update. p
Negative 6828 pI have been googling a lot about how to analyze a crash file and find out what is the problem in my app. Many posts are suggesting different solutions to many scenarios. My scenario is as follows   I deliver the source code to another developer. The other developer generates a release with Bamboo then he sends the link for uploading the .ipa file. The QA tests the applications and generates crash reports with Xcode organizer and sends them to me. However, when i look at the crash files i see no clear indication about the cause of the crash some hexadecimal stuff. Some posts show how to analyze crash reports using the crash log and the DSYM file. But since i do not have a DSYM, i use atos command in terminal and analyze the addresses. But all i have is some weird output. For examplep  pstrongMacBookProdemacbookfolder atos arch armv7 o MyApp.appMyApp 0x5c9fffstrong i get strong0x005c9fff in MyAppstrongp  pCould someone please tell if there is a straight way for analyzing a crash report  should i ask the other developer to provide the .DSYM file  Is there a way to interpret the hexadecimal addresses and get the exact lines where the crash occurred p

Negative 6828 pFor my game, Im going to have a png image that represents the character. When you click somewhere on the screen, he turns it face that direction. I was wondering if there was a way to do that using awt example at the end of the question other than rotating the image 1 degree and saving 360 times. When you are drawing something using the drawImage method, does one of the billion paramaters have anything to do with image rotation Anyways, heres an examplep  precodeifshouldRotate     g.drawImageparameters this is where draw the image and tilt it to lets say 90 degrees.   public void rotationint degreesToRotate, String directionToRotate     ifshouldRotate          g.drawImageparameters this is where I draw the image at 90 degrees, and make it to turn to 100 degrees.       codepre  pHopefully this makes sense. Sorry about the bad format. Writing the question on my phone so I cant use eclipses helpful highlighting and spacing.p

Negative 6828 pIn the book Programming Grails, Burt Beckwith gives some really good insights about how to develop Grails applications which follows OWASP Top 10 recommendations in chapter 9.p  pPunctually,Im trying to implement the recommendation for Insecure Cryptographic Store. That reads as followsp  blockquote   pDo not store passwords in config files, or even in files on the filesystem. Instead, create   a web page that you use to initialize the system where people trusted with passwords   enter the passwords using SSL when the application starts up. Ideally, you shouldnt   trust any one person with all of the information to start the system. For example, to use   JCE encryption, you will need to load a java.security.KeyStore , and this requires a   password, and you use this to create a javax.crypto.SecretKey , which also requires a   password. Use different passwords. If two people know the key store password and two   other people know the key password its a good idea to have backup users in case   someone isnt available, then no one person can decrypt the data or be coerced into   giving someone else access.p blockquote  pI want to secure the Amazon AWS[1] Access Credentials that will be used by the application in order to use the KMS[2] API call to secure encrypt and decrypt information.p  pI would like and example about how this can be achieved. My initial idea is to use a Service in the Singleton scope which holds the credentials and those credentials are setted by a Controller which is responsible of loading the KeyStore and the SecretKey used to decrypt a previusly encrypted and store AWS Access Credentials. p  p[1]a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAmazonWebServices relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAmazonWebServicesap  p[2]a hrefhttpaws.amazon.comenkms relnofollowhttpaws.amazon.comenkmsap

Negative 6828 pIve been trying to force a scrollable div to still do its elastic effect even if scrolltop is 0 are at maximum. The ability to scroll the body or not appears to have nothing to do with it. If the element is at scroll position 0 it will not elastic. p  pIve tried to add 1px of padding on scroll end and then move scrolltop down a pixel but its a poor solution. p  pWebKit overflow scrolling is a CSS property that allows a scrollable element on a webpage to mimic the native scrolling of the window on an iOS device. Provided the element needing to be scrolled is not at the top scrolltop 0 and the user scrolls up the element will use full hardware acceleration and mimic how the window would elasticly scroll including the bounce effect at the end. Equally the element can be scrolled down mimicking full elastic scrolling unless IT is at the bottom at which point it scrolls the body instead. My question is if there is anyway to maintain the scrolling effect on the element as you would be able to do with a native app this scrolling the elemenht and not the body. p

Negative 6828 pIm trying to model a problem where a emCompanyem has many emTeamsem. There is a business rule that emthe name of the team must be unique per companyem. However, a codeTeamcode has many other behaviours, such as joining. Also, a codeTeamcode can have many codeReportcodes  which maintain a reference to codeTeam.Idcode.p  pAt the moment, codeTeamcode and codeCompanycode are separate Aggregate Roots. In order to enforce the invariant that codeTeam.Namecode must be unique per codeCompanycode, should I could create a emTeam Entityem within the codeCompanycode Aggregate which is only responsible for the creation and renaming of codeTeamcode I believe codeCompanycode must create codeTeamcode in order to enforce the rules, and be responsible for renaming, but that is all.p  pMy question is emis this normal Is splitting a domain concept across Aggregate Boundaries a normal way to enforce invariantsemp  pThe only alternative I can see is to move the entire codeTeamcode Aggregate into the codeCompanycode Aggregate. But in this case, Ill be storing a reference to a nonaggregate within codeReportcode.p  pId imagine this is a common modelling problem, but Google is failing mep  pAny help is much appreciatedp

This worksp  precodeltdiv datapopovergetPopoverTextkeygtltdivgt codepre  pBut it results in the call being made every digest, when in my case I know that the value will never change once found.

My question is is this the right way to do it, and are there any negative consequences of it  Is there a better way other than upgrading to get onetimebinding supportp  pstrongEditstrong Apparently one negative consequence is that this extra compile doesnt work properly if the element has some other complex directive in particular codengRepeatcode possibly also codengIfcode etc too but I didnt test that.p

Since IPOPT cant handle piecewise functions, I cant just feed it the bilinear interpolation of the function.p  pTherefore I was wondering what the best strategy is for approximating the discrete signed distance function with a single continuous function. The only two options I know of are using polynomial fitting or RBF approximation. Is there anything more suitable for this problemp

Negative 6828 pThis question may be an extension to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26905243ioscustomobjectinitializationerroriOS custom object initialization Errorap  pSo basically, when trying to initialize some custom class NSObject like the previous question, and UIViewController and UITableViewCell in my case with code like p  precodecell  [[CustomCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleSubtitle reuseIdentifierCellIdentifier]  codepre  por p  precodeCustomViewController  controller   [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierViewController] codepre  pit will return result as  cell  CustomCell0 Objects or controller  UIViewController0 Objects.p  pI debug my app and i see the result from object viewer. someone on the previous question say i should log it rather than using Object Viewer, and so i did. the result was it has the initial value, if i ever assign it in the first place, then it cannot change however i try.p  psee, the CustomCell i create have a strongstatusstrong variable and strongchangeStateValuestrong function. at the first initialization i set status on every cell to 2, then right after the initialization i execute the function to make the status changed to 0. yet the debugged result is still 2.p  pand like the above question, it occurs after the first time i ran the app  from xcode. so when i restart the xcode, it sometimes run normally.p  pi use xcode 6.2, but when i use the 6.1 and below, the problem doesnt seems to existthe app that i made now is a remake.p  pso i think it was xcode faulty. yet im not sure. cause, when i tried to debug it into the codevoidviewDidLoadcode of the customViewController and delete code[super viewDidLoad]code, it runs normal.p  pbut yet again, Cell doesnt have that delegate and still got the same problem... p  pstrongEDITstrongp  precodeCustomCell.h interface CustomCell  UITableViewCell property nonatomic BOOL

Negative 6828 pI am calculating Sound pressure level of a PressureTime signal. The number of samples per second is 9831.dt  0.0001017 sec Totally 749 samples are collected for a simple example case.p  pI am using 512 FFT points for this example case,so the frequency starts from 19.2 Hz to 4877 Hz, and the dF  19.2 Hz.p  pI want to calculate the SPLsound pressure level for 13 octave frequencies.p  pSo I take the 10 band octave frequency range 1Hz, 1.25Hz, 1.6Hz, 2Hz, 2.5Hz, 3.15Hz, 4Hz, 5Hz, 6.3Hz, 8Hz, which is a multiple of 10 ie. it goes next like 10Hz, 12.5Hz, 16Hz.....till 5000Hzp  pNote this is Center frequency of a 13 octave band.p  pAnd each band has lower and upper frequencies fl and fu as show below. the freq is calculated based on sampling rate, so it increments by 19.2. i represent the fft point number, note point 1 is 0Hz. j represent the fft band number, as the frequency increases the number of points inside the band increases.p  precode i2 j13 fl   17.82  freq    19.2  fu   22.27    i3 j16 fl   35.64  freq    38.4  fu   44.54    i4 j18 fl   56.13  freq   57.61  fu   71.27    i5 j19 fl   71.27  freq   76.81  fu   89.09    i6 j20 fl   89.09  freq   96.01  fu   111.4    i7 j21 fl   111.4  freq   115.2  fu   142.5    i8 j21 fl   111.4  freq   134.4  fu   142.5    i9 j22 fl   142.5  freq   153.6  fu   178.2    i10 j22 fl   142.5  freq   172.8  fu   178.2    i11 j23 fl   178.2  freq     192  fu   222.7    i12 j23 fl   178.2  freq   211.2  fu   222.7    i13 j24 fl   222.7  freq   230.4  fu   280.6    i14 j24 fl   222.7  freq   249.6  fu   280.6    i15 j24 fl   222.7  freq   268.8  fu   280.6    i16 j25 fl   280.6  freq     288  fu   356.4    i17 j25 fl   280.6  freq   307.2  fu   356.4    i18 j25 fl   280.6  freq   326.4  fu   356.4    i19 j25 fl   280.6  freq   345.6  fu   356.4    i20 j26 fl   356.4  freq   364.8  fu   445.4  codepre  pSo this causes my calculation of rms inside the lower octave bands to give bad results, as it does not have enough points inside bands usually 1 or 2, as the frequency increases the averaging is better for example in band j 25 four points are used for rms calculation.p  pIs there any way I could improve the rms calculation by splitting the frequency range into two low and high band and apply different fft sampling size to include as much as points inside lower band frequencies usually from 100Hz to 600Hz.p  pI also plan to use Hann window function to reduce leakage, should I apply before FFT or after FFT.p  pyour suggestions are welcome.p

I need to have the sky on slide1 and all other horizontal slides. Afterwards, I need to slide upwards to the stars, then down again to the sky and further down to the ground. So an alternative solution could also be to simply move the background between the three vertical slidesp
