Positive 1046 pI want the game to adapt to the screen resolution, but I want the viewport to always stay the same, so the game basically just resizes itself when running on different PCs. How do I do it So, for example, screen resolution is 1920x1080 and the viewport is 640x480. How do I stretch those 640x480 onto 1920x1080 Is that even possible If this did not make any sense, Ill try to explain another way. Thanks in advancep

Positive 1046 pSo, a bit of a tricky situation and Im not sure whats going on honestly.p  pThis game is using XNA and the 2012 refresh of it.p  pOriginally ran Windows 7. Started a WP7 project. Have been working on and off one. Finished 1 year ago. Before finishing, had to upgrade to Windows 8.1 and likewise began using the 8.1 windows phone simulator. Could no longer use VS 2010 and was using 2012 simulator requires this.p  pFast forward to present. Just about finished with an expansionfix patch so I can forever forget about the game. Currently running Windows 10. Still have VS 2012 and 2010.  Game will not run in VS2010 expected, however, when running VS 2012 and hitting the deploy button... I get ... rather irritating results.p  pThe Windows virtual machine will show up the phone case and such saying OS is booting up. About 5 seconds it. My whole computer resets. No warning, no ding, nothing. It just combusts and restarts.  Any idea why this is happening My guess is compatability issues, but a flat out system crash is not acceptable... Especially without warning or notification or anything. Could not find anything in system events as well.p  pFurther information The refresh should in theory work. I have a side project I work on for fun and it is the Windows PC version of XNA. It is not mobile. When I run THAT XNA project, it runs just fine. No issues and certainly no crashes.p  pAny ideas what this is or how I can fix it Downgrading isnt an option for this game, thats just silly. p

Positive 1046 pI am new to WPF and I want to make a program that is like a game. The common technique I see is to update your game in a dispatch timer say every 10ms. But this is not ideal for me. p  pIn XNAs update method, there is a elapsed time parameter. Knowing how much time the last frame actually used is very helpful for me to decide what I do in the next frame. Is there any similar technique in WPFp  pFor some reason I have to use WPF and cannot use XNA.p

Positive 1046 pWhat I would like to do is to be able to draw a specific set of sprites within a codespriteBatchcode with additive blending. The problem is that the draw order that theyre drawn in needs to be preserved and I cant draw everything else in the codeSpriteBatchcode with additive blending, so I cant just do thisp  precodespriteBatch.BeginSpriteSortMode.FrontToBack, BlendState.AlphaBlend     Draw some stuff here spriteBatch.End  spriteBatch.BeginSpriteSortMode.FrontToBack, BlendState.Additive     Draw stuff with additive blending here spriteBatch.End codepre  pSo my solution would be to write a shader to do what I need and just do thisp  precodespriteBatch.BeginSpriteSortMode.FrontToBack, BlendState.AlphaBlend     Draw some stuff here      foreachEffectPass pass in AdditiveShader.CurrentTechnique.Passes              pass.Apply         Draw stuff with additive shader applied here      spriteBatch.End codepre  pBut codepass.Applycode is literally doing nothing. Even if I try just using a codeBasicEffectcode and have it rotate a few degrees, its doing nothing. The only way I can get it to do anything is to call it like thisp  precodespriteBatch.BeginSpriteSortMode.FrontToBack, BlendState.AlphaBlend,                    null, null, null, AdditiveShader codepre  pThen it actually does something to sprites, but that doesnt really help me because I want to only apply it to specific sprites and still retain the draw order.p  pWhat am I doing wrong when using codepass.Applycode Is there a way to draw a set of sprites with additive blending and another set with alpha blending and still keep the draw order Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.p  pEDIT For clarification, Im working in 2D.p
Positive 1046 pI am developing a game in MonoGame and decided to create my own button class. In order to determine if these buttons were clicked, I determined if they were in the bounds of the button, and if the left mouse button was down. This has lead to two problems.p  ol liThe mouse click doesnt need to start inside the button, and it registers immediately rather than after the mouse button is released Inside the bounds of the button.li liWhen multiple buttons on different screens are in the same area, it results in clicking them both as the mouse button did not release fast enough.li ol  pHow can I make the clicking behave more like the WinForm buttonsp

Positive 1046 pI am creating a 2D game and Ive hit a serious road block when trying to randomly spawn power ups. Basically what I am attempting to do is spawn the power ups off screen and then they move onto the screen at the same speed as my scrolling background Once one of the three power ups has been spawned another one wont spawn until 10 to 30 seconds has passed. I also understand that the shield power Up is the only one that I am trying to get spawning randomly at the moment. I have been researching for hours and writing code that I will post below. I have tried to do this all by myself so I apologize for the quality of the code, I am still a novice and learning. Any help or links to websites would be greatly appreciated as I have no idea where to proceed from here.

The code64code int is the size the actual tiles are drawn into. Thats what I want to avoid, having to write these arrays for each level, instead I need a way of loading levels from files. When loading the tiles of the level, the tile size shouldnt be forgotten in the .txt file. Maybe have it stay alone on the first or the last line of the level file That way each level can have different size of tiles if needed.p  pHere are my a hrefhttppastebin.comypP6XQJE relnofollow titleMap.csMap.csa and a hrefhttppastebin.com5c165T05 relnofollow titleTiles.csTiles.csa classes. I didnt paste them on SO directly it would make the question too long...p  pSo how would you approach this What kind of solution is best I think loading levels similar to tiles like this codeLevelslevel  icode is also I nice way and just have the game increment the int codeicode every time the player finishes a level I should be able to do this myself, but Im just asking how you would read a file. I will make any suggested modifications to my code and also I think codeSplitcodeting the contents of the file by code,code is opinion based, could also use spaces codecode, but since thats an array in the class I had to use code,codes. In the text file I should also remove the code code braces. Anyway I thank you for any feedback and code examples with an explanation would be greatp  pEDIT So should I add the tiles to codecollisionTilescode like thisp  precodepublic int[,] LoadLevelDatastring filename                      using var streamReader  new StreamReaderfilename                              var serializer  new JsonSerializer                 Generateint[,]serializer.DeserializestreamReader, typeofint[,], 64                 return int[,]serializer.DeserializestreamReader, typeofint[,]                       codepre

Positive 1046 pEver since I started making games in Flash, I have always had a preference to use vector graphics over bitmaps or textures. In Monogame andor XNA, it is fairly standard to import bitmaps or PNGs and use those for textures, but I would much rather have the textures drawn at runtime at the expense of detail and performance. One framework I found was a hrefhttpcommunity.monogame.nettaltsketchvectorgraphicslibrarycfreetypeportguivectorgraphics775 relnofollowAltSketcha, although its not free and it looks overly complicated. Is there any way to do this in MonogameXNA Or will I have to switch to another framework like a hrefhttpwww.cocos2dx.org relnofollowCocos2dxa or another non .NET frameworkp  pI do not want to use Unity3D  that is out of the question.p  pThanks for your helpp

It wouldve been nice to get a modern build working.  p  pI try to offer up some speculation but Im sort of out of my depth here.  p  pJSIL0.7.6  wont build in AnyCPU, requires the solution platform be set to x86.p  pLatest JSIL git release  A lot of the projects are now set to AnyCPU and setting them to x86 will create a various mixture of errors or warnings.  p  pSo I think somewhere along the line I might be having problems with a build at the point certain projects in JSIL went from x86 to 64 bit support.p  pI have visual studio express 2010 and visual studio community installed.  p  pIve tried things like using XNA refresh.

First let me explain topology and behaviourp  ol liIve defined a background rect with vertices in XY plane 0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1li liLight position is 0.5,0.5 and can be moved by mouseli liNew rects can be added by mouse click in the same XY plane, as shadow casters and in the same time as shadow receivers. Here is the video a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvxn1jHdTpAHU relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvxn1jHdTpAHUali ol  pSo, to calc depth buffer all around a circle from light position i dop  ol lipFor each vertex of the poligon line, VS calculates angle from light position by atan2 function, and output position of the vertex to be strong1 lt X lt 1strong, strongY  0.5strong and strong0 lt Z lt 1strong, so i just generate horizontal lines according to the arc of angle in the middle of height of a target texture just for nowp  precodestruct VertexShaderInput      float4 Position  SVPOSITION     float4 Color  COLOR0  struct VertexShaderOutputMakeShadow      float4 Position  SVPOSITION     float2 PosW  TEXCOORD0  VertexShaderOutputMakeShadow MakeShadowVSVertexShaderInput input      VertexShaderOutputMakeShadow output     float2 v  input.Position.xy  LightPos     float angle  atan2v.y, v.x  minus to flip y, because y goes down     output.Position  float4angle, 0, lengthv, 3.1415926535 same as line bellow, but 1 HLSL instruction because x is devided by w always in hardware     output.Position  float4angle  3.1415926535, 0, lengthv, 1.0     output.PosW  input.Position.xy     return output  codepre  pthen by PS, i calculate the depth buffer, depth  interpolated PosW  light posp  precodefloat MakeShadowPSVertexShaderOutputMakeShadow input  COLOR0      float2 v  input.PosW  LightPos     return lengthv  codepreli ol  pand finally, i render shadows by comparing distance between light and a pixel with depth buffer distance at the same angle, so if the distance is more than stored then it is in shadowp  precodestruct VertexShaderOutputUseShadow      float4 Position  SVPOSITION     float2 PosW  TEXCOORD0     float4 Color  COLOR0  VertexShaderOutputUseShadow UseShadowVSVertexShaderInput input      VertexShaderOutputUseShadow output     float4 p  float4input.Position.xy, 0, 1     output.Position  mulp, World     output.Color  input.Color     output.PosW  input.Position.xy     return output  float4 UseShadowPSVertexShaderOutputUseShadow input  COLOR0      float2 v  input.PosW  LightPos     float angle  atan2v.y, v.x     float2 UV  float2angle  3.1415926535  1  2, 0.5     float shadowD  tex2DshadowSampler, UV     float d  lengthv     return input.Color  1  d gt shadowD  1  d  codepre  pBut there is strange thing  you can see it at the 019 in the video yellow areas nearby sun in the left top coner, something like a fisheye effect. And second not sure how to fix it yet  where line begins say 135 degrees to 135 it should rendered to 0.75PI to 0.75PI left line of a rect so it rewrites almost whole buffer directly 031, however i want it in 2 parts  1..0.75 and 0.751. Well, ive found a solution, but its weird. Cant find fine one  For this video, i just dont render left side at all, so there such artifacts like not shadowed blue triangles as at the 030. Any ideas p  pWell, implemented weird solution  i just render vertex buffer twice with a different shader, so VS findouts if an angle between line points  PI then adjust X zw are xy of the second point of the linep  precodeVertexShaderOutputMakeShadow MakeShadowVS1VertexShaderInput input      VertexShaderOutputMakeShadow output     float2 v1  input.Position.xy  LightPos, v2  input.Position.zw  LightPos     float angle1  atan2v1.y, v1.x, angle2  atan2v2.y, v2.x     if absangle1  angle2 gt 3.1415926535              if angle1 lt 0                      angle1  2  3.1415926535  angle1                   output.Position  float4angle1  3.1415926535, 0, lengthv1, 1.0     output.PosW  input.Position.xy     return output  codepre  pand second VS only differsp  precodeif absangle1  angle2 gt 3.1415926535      if angle1 gt 0              angle1  angle1  2  3.1415926535       else      angle1  100  codepre  pP.S. angle1  100 means here to disable rasterizing lines which were feeded by the first shader, so what is happenning youtu.beBWmBnF1eThop  pBut first problem is still there.

Positive 1046 pIm looking to make an abstract class Entity which then has few classes that derive from it like Enemy, Friendly and Player. The reason I do this is because the classes have a lot of propertiesfields that are alike. I also have 2 methods codeupdateEntitycode and codedrawEntitycode.

Positive 1046 pI have been searching how I can make a chatbox in XNA, but I cant find a way how. I want a chatbox in my game that displays like 10 messages a time.  The messages can be store in like a List or something  but I dont know how to do that. I know how to store it, but I dont really know how to put that inside a box  probably in front of an image, but the width of the string can be bigger . So what and how is the best way to do it Thanks for reading the entire question.p

Positive 1046 pSo this may be a bit vague, but Im having some issues. Basically, I am drawing my little ninja sprite 16x16px and on 2 frames of his animation, he loses pixels on his headband. I have looked everywhere in an attempt to find an answer, but to no avail.p  pOriginal Sprite Sheet Bugged frames are 4th row, 3rd and 4th frames p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com1gT6Q.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1gT6Q.png altenter image description herea p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comVJUD7.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVJUD7.png altenter image description hereap  pAfter a little more investigation, it seems that the bugged pixels are due to the width of the sprite sheet. It almost seems random what pixels get messed up depending on the width. However, with a constant width, the messed up pixels are constant regardless of creating a new build or using an old one.p  pAs you can see, the back of his headband is missing pixels. While it may not be game changing, it is very annoying and if anyone knows of a fix, thatd be great Thanks guysp

Positive 1046 pI made a simple networking xna game using c and lidgren. But velocity of objects are different on friends computer  resolution of window is the same, fps are the same both 60, application is the same, but hes character is just slower for some reason. For some time his velocity is equal to mine, but then it slows down again. Other friends do have equal velocities as I do. What could be a problem The program adjusts movement according to fps, so there is probably no problem in fps.p

Positive 1046 pOkay so, I have looked at a lot of question from people like my self who are beginners in programming. And most of the time their questions are hard to answer or understand what the question really is. I will do my best to be as specific as possible about my problems so the above mentioned doesnt happen.p  pFirst off I have been following the tutorials over at  a hrefhttpxnagpa.netxna4rpg.php relnofollowhttpxnagpa.netxna4rpg.phpa. And my tile engine is based off the one that Jamie McMahon makes in his rpg tutorial series. Just so you know what the general structure of my tile engine is like.p  pSecondly I will try to explain what Im trying to do inside the tile engine. I recently found an article about how the original Civilization generated their maps. a hrefhttpforums.civfanatics.comshowthread.phpt498630 relnofollowhttpforums.civfanatics.comshowthread.phpt498630a  And I rather like this approach to generating a world style map if you will. ie oceans, continents, islands ect. So I decided to try to take this and implement it into my tile engine. It works for the most part. The parts that I added to the tile engine are supposed to randomly pick a location in the specified map layer y,x and then from that location generate a chunk of landor tiles and then replace the tiles in the map layer with the tiles created in the chunk of land. ill show the code in a minute and then do that for a desired amount of either number of landmasseschunks or continue creating chunks of land until the number of land tiles is equal to a desired amount of land tiles.p  pMy Problem  My program does what its supposed to as mentioned above except it only ever makes one landmass.Chunk of land tiles It does everything else just fine but it for some reason will not make more than one landmass. Now I suspect that it actually is making the other landmasses but somehow the way the tile engine is set up to display map layers is causing the landmasss to be covered up with water. Maybe its a layering issue. But It shouldnt be because the landmasss are all part of the same layer. So Im completely baffled as to why its doing this. p  precode   public void GenerateLandChunksMapLayer layer              Tile tile  new Tile0, 3              Random random  new Random              int x  random.Next8, layer.Width  10              int y  random.Next10, layer.Height  20              int length  random.Next10, 70             for int i  0 i lt length i                              if length  0 ampamp x gt 8  x lt layer.Width  10 ampamp y gt 10  y lt layer.Height  20                                      layer.SetTiley, x, tile                     layer.SetTiley, x  1, tile                     layer.SetTiley  1, x, tile                                    x  random.Nextx  1, x  2                 y  random.Nexty  1, y  2                     codepre  pThis is my method for generating the actual chunks it does what I want it to. ABOVEp  precode            MapLayer randomLayer  new MapLayer100, 100          for int y  0 y lt randomLayer.Height y                      for int x  0 x lt randomLayer.Width x                              Tile tile  new Tile1, 3                 randomLayer.SetTilex, y, tile                                int landMasses  5         for int i  0 i lt landMasses i                      randomLayer.GenerateLandChunksrandomLayer          codepre  pThis is where I create the map layer. I initially set the entire map to water tilestile 1,3 then I tell it to generate 5 landmasses.p  pIt seems like this should work. And it does but like I said only for the first one. It doesnt display the other 4 land masses.p  pMy Question Is there anything you can see here that Im doing wrong in order to accomplish what Im trying to dop  pIf you need more of the code to understand whats going on let me know and ill post what ever you need. And like I said everything other than what I have posted is the exact same as it is in Jamie McMahons tile engine. p  pIm sorry if I have come off as unclear or if my question is hard to answer. I tried to make it as straight forward as possible. Thank you for your time. p

Negative 1046 pI have an Excel spreadsheet provided as a report, when really its more of a database, with the row number acting as primary key.  I need to compare some columns in this set with a different set of records from an Access 2007 database.

Negative 1046 pIm planning to create a website using django that will have a common header throughout the entire website.  Ive read djangos documentation on templating inheritance, but I cant seem to find an elegant solution for the dynamic elements in my header.p  pFor example, the header in the website will include tabs, say similar to a hrefhttpwww.google.com relnofollowhttpwww.google.coma where it has Web, Images, etc, where the selected tab will describe your current location in the website.p  pUsing the django template inheritance, it would seem like you would create a base template like thisp  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml xmllangen langengt ltheadgt     ltlink relstylesheet hrefstyle.css gt     lttitlegt block title My Amazing Site endblock lttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv idheadergt      block header       .... html to create tabs ...      endblock header  ltdivgt codepre  pand then in all of my other pages, i would do thisp  precode extends base.html   block header    .... html to create tabs with one tab selected ...  endblock header  codepre  pwhich seems annoying as every single one of my pages would have to have duplicated HTML with the header information, but slightly different.   So when its time to add a new tab, i have to modify every single HTML file.p  pUpon further reading, it seems like some other possible solutions arep  p1  Create a custom template tag that takes in which tab is currently selected, that way in each HTML page i just call      block header       mycustomtag abc       endblock header p  pI dont like this solution because it would requiring placing HTML into the python code for creating this custom tag.p  p2  Create X number of subtemplates of base.html, all with the appropriate tab selected.  Then each page would inherit from the appropriate subtemplate based on which tab they want selected.   p  pThis solution seems fine, except for the fact that it will require X number of almost exactly the same HTML, and still runs into the issue of having to modify all the files when a tab is added or removed.p  p3  Use javascript like jquery to modify the header on page load to select the correct tab.p  pThis solution is fine but then would require one to remember to add this functionality to every pages javascript.  the good part is that the header HTML would only live in a single HTML file.p  pAny other suggestionsp  pThanksp

Negative 1046 pVisual Studio 2008 Web Deployment Project Team Build ASPPARSE Errorp  pI seem to have a common problem one that is showing up but does not have a clear solution.p  pI have a Visual Studio 2008 project structure that contains several projects that are class libraries, a web application project, and a recently added web deployment project.  Ive heard of this issue with MVC setups.  Also, the solutions that Ive seen assume that MVC is being used.p  pI have verified that the build works correctly from the IDE.  I have not changed the defaults of the web deployment project except for the name of the assembly it produces as a result of the single assembly merge.p  pIve set my solution to build the web deployment project only when the solution is built for Release.  I have a custom build script that grabs this branch of code and a development branch of code.  The build script correctly builds the release version of this code and the debug version of the development branch.p  pThe problem comes when building the release version.  All the projects build sucessfully except for the web deployment project.  TFS Build errors when building this project with the following errorp  precodexx.csprojglobal.asax1 error ASPPARSE Could not load type xxx.xx.Global. codepre  pThe xx.csproj is the web application project and the xxx.xx.Global is the Global.asax code behind class.p  pFrom my reading it seems like there may be some copying issue with TFS Build.  Ive read several responses here regarding MVC.  This is not a MVC setup, but I believe it is of a similar issue.  Im not sure where any copying code should go.  Ive tried placing some suggested code in my AfterBuild target in the TFSBuild.proj file but found code didnt change this error.p  precodelt To modify your build process, add your task inside one of the targets below and uncomment it.         Other similar extension points exist, see Microsoft.WebDeployment.targets.   ltTarget NameBeforeBuildgt   ltTargetgt   ltTarget NameBeforeMergegt   ltTargetgt   ltTarget NameAfterMergegt   ltTargetgt   ltTarget NameAfterBuildgt   ltTargetgt   gt codepre  pThe code above appears int the project file commented out.  My thinking is that the BeforeMerge target would let me copy those binaries that are needed.  I do not know how to write any script to do this.  Ive consulted a couple of TFS books but neither of them contain information regarding web deployment projects.  Much to my chagrin it seems that I cannot find much information from Microsoft in regards to this issue as well.p  pSeeing that Ive only seen solutions that reference MVC solutions I should say that Ive looked into doing stuff in the AfterBuild target.  The build script above is directly from the deploycsproj where Ive tried it in the TSBuild script.  Is there a difference to attempting to copy binaries in either locationp  pCan anyone explain what is going on  Do I have to write individual build scripts for each project so that they copy their binaries to the correct directory for merge executionp

Negative 1046 pIm wanting to export a 3D scene from a Viewport3D to a bitmap.p  pThe obvious way to do this would be to use RenderTargetBitmap  however when I this the quality of the exported bitmap is significantly lower than the onscreen image. Looking around on the internet, it seems that RenderTargetBitmap doesnt take advantage of hardware rendering. Which means that the rendering is done at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms742196.aspxTier 0a.

Negative 1046 pI am loading JPEGs into a Flash presentation using codeloadcode with a codeflash.display.Loadercode and its working great. The JPEGs are sizing to their native resolution which is perfect. However, if I maximize the Flash presentation in the Flash Player, the JPGs do NOT take advantage of the bigger screen.p  pFor example, the presentation is 1024x768, and the image is 1280x400. Normally the image shows with a part offscreen in the Flash presentation. However, if I expand the Flash presentation to 1680x1200, the freshly loaded image still goes offscreen. strongIs there any way to load the jpg or png, or whatever to take advantage of the displayed resolution of the Flash presentationstrong p  pstrongEditstrong I realize this question is hard to read, so any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 1046 pI cant for the life of me get RJS to replace an elements innerHTML with an instance variables attribute, i.e. something like codething.namecodep  pIll show all the code simplified from the actual project, but still complete, and I hope the solution will be foreheadslap obvious to someone...p  pIn RoR, Ive made a simple page displaying a random Chinese character.p  pThis is a codeWordcode object with attributes codechinesecode and codeenglishcode.p  pClicking on a link titled What is this reveals the codeenglishcode attribute using RJS. Currently, it also hides the What is this link and reveals a Try Another link that just reloads the page, effectively starting over with a new random character.p  pThis is fine, but there are other elements on the page that make their own database queries, so I would like to load a new random character by an AJAX call, leaving the rest of the page alone.p  pThis has turned out to be harder than I expected I have no trouble replacing the html using linkremoteto and page.replacehtml, but I cant get it to display anything that includes an instance variable.p  pI have a Word resource and a Page resource, which has a home page, where all this fun takes place. In the PagesController, Ive made a couple ways to get random words. Either one works fine...p  pHeres the codep  precodeclass PagesController lt ApplicationController   def home      allwords  Word.findall     randomword  allwords.rand      randomwords  Word.findall, limit gt 100, order gt rand     randomfirst  randomwords[1]    end end codepre  pAs an aside, the SQL call with codelimit gt 100code is just in case I think of some way to cycle through those random words. Right now its not useful. Also, the rand is MySQL specific, as far as I know.p  pIn the home page view its HAML, I have thisp  precodecharacterbox   renderpartial gt character, object gt randomword if randomword  whatisthis    linktoremote  what is this, url gt  controller gt words, action gt revealcharacter , html gt  title gt Click for the translation.   tryanother.style gt displaynone    linkto try another, rootpath codepre  pNote that the s in this case represent divs with the given ids, not comments, because this is HAML.p  pThe character partial looks like this its erb, for no real reasonp  precodeltdiv idcharactergt   lt randomword.chinese  gt ltdivgt  ltdiv idrevealed styledisplaynonegt   ltulgt     ltligtltspan idenglishgtlt randomword.englishname gtltspangtltligt   ltulgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe revealcharacter.rjs file looks like thisp  precodepage[revealed].visualeffect slidedown, duration gt .2 page[english].visualeffect highlight,                              startcolor gt ffff00,                              endcolor gt ffffff,                              duration gt 2.5  page.delay0.8 do   page[whatisthis].visualeffect fade, duration gt .3   page[tryanother].visualeffect appear end codepre  pThat all works perfectly fine.p  pBut if I try to turn codelinkto try anothercode into codelinktoremotecode, and point it to an RJS template that replaces the character element with something new, it only works when I replace the innerHTML with static text. If I try to pass an instance variable in there, it never works.p  pFor instance, lets say Ive defined a second random word under Pageshome...p  pIll add coderandomsecond  randomwords[2]code there.p  pThen, in the home page view, Ill replace the try another link previously pointing to the coderootpathcode, with thisp  precode linktoremote try another, url gt  controller gt words, action gt secondcharacter , html gt  title gt Click for a new character.  codepre  pIll make that new RJS template, at appviewswordssecondcharacter.rjs, and a simple test like this shows that its workingp  precodepage.replacehtmlcharacter, hi codepre  pBut if I change it to thisp  precodepage.replacehtmlcharacter, randomsecond.english codepre  pI get an error saying I fed it a nil objectp  blockquote   pActionViewTemplateError undefined method englishname for nilNilClass on line 1 of appviewswordssecondcharacter.rjs   1 page.replacehtmlcharacter, randomsecond.englishp blockquote  pOf course, actually instantiating randomsecond, randomthird and so on ad infinitum would be ridiculous in a real app I would eventually figure out some better way to keep grabbing a new random record without reloading the page, but the point is that I dont know how to get any instance variable to work here.p  pThis is not even approaching my ideal solution of rendering a partial that includes the object I specify, like thisp  precodepage.replacehtml character, partial gt newcharacter, object gt randomsecond codepre  pAs I cant get an instance variable to work directly, I obviously cannot get it to work via a partial.p  pI have tried various things likep  precodeobject gt randomsecond codepre  porp  precodelocals gt  randomsecond gt randomsecond  codepre  pIve tried adding these all over the place  in the codelinktoremotecode options most obviously  and studying what gets passed in the parameters, but to no avail. Its at this point that I realize I dont know what Im doing.p  pThis is my first question here. I erred on the side of providing all necessary code, rather than being brief. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1046 pIm using JavScript and jQuery to read an XML document and subsequently use the information from the XML to create HTML objects.p  pThe main C nodes in the XML document all have a type attribute, and depending on the type I want to run a function which will create a new html object using the other attributes assigned to that particular C node node.p  pCurrently, I have a codeforcode loop which extracts each C node from the XML and also its attributes e.g. width, height, x, y.p  pAlso inside the codeforcode loop, I have an codeifcode statement which checks the type attribute of the current C node being processed, and depending on the type it will run a different function which will then create a new HTML object with the attributes which have been drawn from the XML.p  pThe problem is that there may be more than one C node of the same type, so for example when Im creating the function that will run when a C node of type1 is detected, I cannot use the codevar p  document.createElementpcode because if a C node of the same type comes up later in the loop it will clash and override that element with that variable that has just been created.p  pIm not really sure how to approach thisp  pHere is my entire script.

Negative 1046 pIm using SQLite as my database, and Im a little bit confused about how Id configure the path to it. Basically, I have a static String in one of my classes  which, after initialization turns to something like this p  precodeprivate static String DATABASE  dbmy.db codepre  pThe folder codedbcode is located directly under codeWebContentcode, so, to get access to it, I need to use a codeServletContextcodes codegetRealPathcode method. To use that, I need access to a servlet, and since Im not sure which servlet will be the first one to be called, I need to perform a check in all of my requests to see if the database has been set, and if it hasnt then set it. I think there should be a better way of doing this.

Negative 1046 pI want to create a batch file that executes a command delete the file, for a simple example, though my command is customdifferent on each file matching a wildcard say .jpg that was modified since some date such as 112010 or later.

I need to support running in Windows 2000 or later.p  hr  h1The final solution I usedh1  pSlightly modified from the answer by pipitasp  precodeECHO OFF for f usebackq tokens17 delims  I in dirodtw  findstr I .jpg do    if KIJ N LM GEQ 20100801 AM 0000      del P P      codepre  pSome notes Remove P to not require YN confirmation on each delete.  I escaped the  characters so they would work inside a .bat file.  The  is necessary to escape the pipe.  The usebackq makes the backticks delimit a command to execute instead of searching a literal string or file, tokens sets the number of variables to place the parsed line in starting with I, and delims sets the delimiters including the trailing space used to parse the line into those tokens.  I added .jpg as the findstr search string, since I only wanted to process .jpg files.  Some possible problems are that your locale might print dates differently, requiring a different number of variables or different delimiters, and you might have some false positive matches with an embedded .jpg in the file name requiring a findstr regex, etc..p  pIf you dont need to support Windows 2000 and earlier, using forfiles as suggested by  Johannes would make this much easier.p

Negative 1046 pWe have a classic VBScript default.asp page in the root of our site. This is a heavy, legacy page and converting it is not an option right now. We also have a new ASP.NET MVC 2 application we want to host on the same site.

I have even changed the priorityorder of the default document in IIS for this site to treat default.asp as the preferred document. Ive even deleted the dummy MVC default.aspx page out of the root, and still the MVC routing is stealing requests for the root of the site.p  pThe temporary solution is for me to have HomeController.Index redirect the user back to default.asp. This works, but then it shows up ugly and visible in the address bar,br  a hrefhttpwww.example.comdefault.asp relnofollowhttpwww.example.comdefault.aspa lt not what I want to show.p  pAny suggestionsanswers on how to get these both to coexist Perhaps something I can add to web.config to make this specific exception for the homepage Thank youp  h3UPDATEh3  pI apologize for the delay in getting back to this but it went on the back burner for a while and I honestly almost forgot about this however I did manage to get this working Id like to give credit to both Chris Marisic and Chance, since combined they helped me figure this out.p  pThe problem was that sure enough, it seems there was a default route as Chance suggested in a comment that was catching these requests to the site root. p  pSo, by tweaking this, and also adding coderoutes.IgnoreRoutecode emptystring as the first rule in my routing list, this now works p  pThank you everyone for your helpp

Negative 1046 pI am looking for some suggestions on how to approach the following computer vision problem. Below are 4 samples of an eye tracking dataset that I am working with. I would like to write code takes one such image and calculates the x,y position of the center of the pupil. I am currently using MATLAB, but I am open to using other software too.p  pCan someone recommend an approach I could use for this task Here are some things I already tried but didnt work TOO well.p  ul liI tried to use circle hough transform, but that requires me to guess the radius of the pupil, which is a bit problematic. Also, due to distortions, the pupil is not always exactly a circle, which may make this approach harder still.li liI tried thresholding the image based on pixel brightness and using regionprops MATLAB function to look for a region of roughly say 200 pixel area with very low eccentricity i.e. as circular as possible. However, this is very sensitive to the threshold value, and some images of the eye are brighter than others based on the lighting conditions. Note the 4 samples below are meannormalized already, and still one of the images is brighter than others overall probably because of some very dark random pixel somewhereli ul  pAny commentssuggestions would be appreciatedp  pEDIT thanks for the comment Stargazer. The algorithm should ideally be able to determine that the pupil is not in the image, as is the case for the last sample. Its not a big deal if I lose track of it for a while. Its much worse if it gives me wrong answer though.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqA5yj.jpg altalt textp

Negative 1046 pI would like to face a problem for which I havent seen a solution looking around in Internet. This is I need to save the elements drawn by WEB users on a canvas space not as a flat image, but each one singularly. This in order to let the same user, or even other users,  to modify every single element draganddrop, erase, erase partially, ecc. in a second moment. This should also help to eventually save a drawing history and restore it in next working sessions. All the examples I found were intended to save just a canvas flat image.p  h3Updateh3  pTo better clarify not necessary as layers, but for sure I thought to realize several different driving tools a drawing element is the singular applicationistance of a tool a circle, a box, a added image, a straight line or even a free hand drawing that start from the moment of right button mouse click till it is released. Then the chance to save the elements state allowing to modify each one in a second moment. p

Negative 1046 pCurrently I am doing a jQuery post to fetch some data from the server.  In standard circumstances a large JSON is returned. p  pThe first time this call runs it requires a large amount of processing time, Ive seen up to 15 minutes. We do have plans to create worker processes to build these behind the scenes and relay progress to the client after the processing has completed we store this in a cache and return the JSON to the user. p  pIn both scenarios we return exactly the same JSON to the client, the only difference being, if the cache is built it is returned in a few milliseconds, if the cache is not built, it can take a long time for the client to receive the response.p  pWhen this is running on the server, if the requests takes a long time the client never receives the ajax response but the server does complete the process access logs show 200 statusCode and store the cache. For reference on my localhost the ajax response is always received, regardless of time or so I have seen thus far. p  pIn a nutshell, we make a ajax post, if it takes a long time, the post response is never received and ends up waiting indefinitely.p  pThis sounds like it is either a PHP or server side setting, but I cant seem to find the issue. p  pAny ideas or help are much appreciated.p

Negative 1046 pI encounter what I believe to be a bug and I was just wondering if this is already known as a issue or if this is not a issue and why.p  pThe problem related to Read Only Properties on a Type when compiling with the VB.Net Compiler in Visual Studio 2008.p  pFollows are the class definitions and a small C program which will not compile.

But the property is not set.

Delegates should be parsed the same as a Method.p  pIs the C compiler over extending itself I think not. My experience is that this is a bug in the vb.net compiler and should be fixed by a patch to the IDE.p  pLast but surely not least what occurs when the Invoke happensp  pThe delegate surely does not use reflection to set the property automagically so I assume the CLR sees the readonly qualifier and a NOOP gets executed. Is that actually what occurs or is the behavior undefinedp  pThank you for your timep

Negative 1046 pI just learned that its possible to increase the size of the memory youll allocate to a struct when using the malloc function.

Negative 1046 pI have a data structure like this in the database in the features table called codetokenvectorcode a hashp  precodeFeature.find1.tokenvector   a gt 0.1, b gt 0.2, c gt 0.3  codepre  pThere are 25 of these features. First, I entered the data into Redis with this in codescriptconsolecodep  precodeREDIS.set  feature1,              TokenVector.tojson Feature.find1.tokenvector    ... REDIS.set  feature25,              TokenVector.tojson Feature.find25.tokenvector   codepre  pcodeTokenVector.tojsoncode converts the hash into JSON format first. The 25 JSON hashes stored in Redis take up about 8 MB.p  pI have a method, called codeAnalysislocatecode. This method takes the dot product between two tokenvectors. The dot product for hashes works like thisp  precodehash1   a gt 1, b gt 2, c gt 3  hash2   a gt 4, b gt 5, c gt 6, d gt 7  codepre  pEach overlapping key in the hash a, b, and c in this case, and not d have their values multiplied pairwise together, then added up. p  pThe value for codeacode in codehash1code is 1, the value for codeacode in codehash2code is 4. Multiply these to get code14  4code.p  pThe value for codebcode in codehash1code is 2, the value for codebcode in codehash2code is 5. Multiply these to get code25  10code.p  pThe value for codeccode in codehash1code is 3, the value for codeccode in codehash2code is 6. Multiply these to get code36  18code.p  pThe value for codedcode in codehash1code is nonexistent, the value for codedcode in codehash2code is 7. In this case, set coded  0code for the first hash. Multiply these to get code07  0code.p  pNow add up the multiplied values. code4  10  18  0  32code. This is the dot product of hash1 and hash2.p  precodeAnalysis.locate hash1, hash2   gt 32 codepre  pI have a method that is often used, codeAnalysistopicizecode. This method takes in a parameter, codetokenvectorcode, which is just a hash, similar to above. codeAnalysistopicizecode takes the dot product of codetokenvectorcode and each of the 25 features codetokenvectorscode, and creates a new vector of those 25 dot products, called codefeaturevectorcode. A codefeaturevectorcode is just an array. Here is what the code looks likep  precodedef self.topicize tokenvector    featurevector  FeatureVector.new    featurevector.push     locate tokenvector, TokenVector.fromjson REDIS.get feature1         ...   featurevector.push     locate tokenvector, TokenVector.fromjson REDIS.get feature25         featurevector  end codepre  pAs you can see, it takes the dot product of codetokenvectorcode and each features codetokenvectorcode that I entered into Redis above, and pushes the value into an array.p  pMy problem is, this takes about 18 seconds each time I invoke the method. Am I misusing Redis I think the problem could be that I shouldnt load Redis data into Ruby. Am I supposed to send Redis the data codetokenvectorcode and write a Redis function to have it do the codedotproductcode function, rather than writing it with Ruby codep

I notice what looks to be a bug in WAS 8. I have an Enhanced EAR, I have a build that creates it. I include a libraries.xml file as well as a deployment.xml in the root of the EAR archive. The application references one shared library. When I deploy the application to WAS 8 the shared library reference does not get configured correctly. When I go into the Admin Console I see that for some reason WAS has surround my library name with quotes. So instead of Spring 3.0.5.RELEASEp  pit looks like Spring 3.0.5.RELEASEp  pI can manually fix this in the Admin Console. This didnt occur in WAS 7 at all so I can only assume it is a bug.

Negative 1046 pFor months now, I have been trying to solve a problem regarding rendering images properly onto Aero glass. From what I have gathered so far, to do this you need to render the graphics object as a bitmap, because the Aero requires an alpha channel. To be more specific, what I am trying to do is make a perfect, nonflicker text box  and other controls. I do not want to fall back to rendering part of the form aero, as I may want more than one text box. Also, the DrawToBitmap function works, but is far too slow, which is why I want to accomplish this with BitBlt.p  pWhat I have right now, is the Graphics control of a TextBox, stored as a IntPtr. How do I take this graphics control, load it into a Bitmap, and draw that Bitmap with BitBlt or as the link suggests, fixing the alpha value of the Graphics objectp  pSo my question is, is there anyway to do this with Visual Basic 2010 .NETp  pIf anyone can answer this question, provide input, or a equivalent alternative, Id be very grateful.p  pHere is a link to a previous thread I have made, which describes the problem in much more detailp  pa hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSVsexpressvbthreadf0e9fa0c95354cdb826f673ef58c408a relnofollowhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSVsexpressvbthreadf0e9fa0c95354cdb826f673ef58c408aap  pBest regards,p  ul liJake M.li ul  pP.

To look at images of a portfolio item, the user clicks the view project images link to expand a lightbox that extends 100 of the browser. The idea is to use the lightbox to center the portfolio images in a floating fullscreen window, and when you close the window, the user returns to the page beneath, in the spot they left. This is very important because the list of portfolio items beneath could be long. The Colorbox is a basic iframe.p  pAs mentioned before, I have a problem with two scrollbars next to each other. You can see the problem atp  pwww.joshuabutler.comsamplehome.html p  pId like to cover or remove the base scrollbar.p  pHere is a similar problem a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7297211jqueryhowcaniresetthedocumentscrollbarwheniappendalayeroverthedojquery How can I reset the document scrollbar when I append a layer over the documenta I couldnt figure out how to use this for my purposep  pIf someone has a better solution to Colorbox, or knows a simple fix, please let me know. p  pAll the lightbox solutions, such as Thickbox, Shadowbox amp Lightbox all have this problem.p  pThanks in advance Joshp

Negative 1046 pI am programming a robot in C, and I have run into a problem I cant seem to figure out.p  pThe only way to solve this problem would be to use a lot of codegotocode statements. I am trying to figure out a way to save myself writing over 100 codegotocode points and statements and if statements, etc. and am wondering if there is a way to goto the value of a string. for examplep  precodestring Next  beginning goto Next beginning codepre  pIs there any way to codegotocode the value of codeNextcode, or to substitute in the value of codeNextcode into the codegotocode statementp  pIf there is a way to do this, then I will be able to just change the value of codeNextcode for each driving command, and then codegotocode whatever the value of the string codeNextcode is.p  pIn other words, just converting the string to a codegotocode identifier, or substituting it in place of one.p  pThanks for the helpp  pEDITp  pA lot of you guys are suggesting the use of switch statements. I am not sure this would work because of how i have it programmed. The structure of the program is here by the way this code only includes a little of what i actually have, my real code is over 500 lines so far. Also, the driving commands are majorly simplified. but the basic concept is here, easier to understand than what i wouldve had.p  precodetask main    integer list   int forwardDrivingSelector  0   int backwardDrivingSelector  0   int rightRotatingSelector  0   string nextCommand   int waitTime  0   int countup  0    driving commands    driveForward   whileforwardDrivingSelector  1        motor[leftMotor]  127     motor[rightMotor]  127     countup     wait1Msec1     ifcountup  waitTime            countup  0       goto nextCommand           driveBackward   whilebackwardDrivingSelector  1        motor[leftMotor]  127     motor[rightMotor]  127     countup     wait1Msec1     ifcountup  waitTime            countup  0       goto nextCommand           rightRotate   whilerightRotatingSelector  1        motor[leftMotor]  127     motor[rightMotor]  127     countup     wait1Msec1     ifcountup  waitTime            countup  0       goto nextCommand            autonomous driving code    first command, drive forward for 1000 milliseconds   forwardDrivingSelector  1   nextCommand  secondCommand   waitTime  1000   goto driveForward    secondCommand   forwardDrivingSelector  0    second command, rotate right for 600 milliseconds   rightRotatingSelector  1   nextCommand  thirdCommand   waitTime  600   goto rightRotate    thirdCommand   rightRotatingSelector  0    third command, drive backwards for 750 milliseconds   backwardDrivingSelector  1   nextCommand  end   waitTime  750   goto driveBackward    end   backwardDrivingSelector  0   codepre  pso. how this works. i have a list of integers, including driving command selectors, the countup and waitTime integers, and the string that i was talking about, nextCommand. next comes the driving commands. in my real code, i have about 30 commands, and they are all hooked up to a remote control and its over 400 lines for just the driving commands. next comes the autonomous code. the reason i set it up like this is so that the autonomous code part would be, short, simple, and to the point. pretty much to add a command to the driving code, you turn on the selector, tell the nextCommand string what the next command is, set the waitTime which is how long it does the command, in milliseconds, then you make the code goto the driving command which you are putting in. the driving command drives for the amount of time you put in, then does goto nextCommandp  pThis would all theoretically work if there was a way to make the goto statement interpret the string as an identifier so it can be changed.p  pThere are about 4 simple ways i can think of right now that could get past this easily, but they would make the code really really long and cluttered.p  pNow that you have a better understanding of my question, any more input p  pbtw  i am using a program called robotC, and i am programming a vex robot. so i HAVE to use plain, basic, C, and i cant use any addons or anything... which is another reason this is complicated because i cant have multiple classes and stuff like that...p
Negative 1046 pI have a simple table that contains unique identifiers and a counter value for each of them. What I need to get as result is the position of a specific identifier after the table was sorted by the counter values.p  pMy current solution would be to do a SELECT for all data while sorting the result, then going through the result list to find the required identifier, the position where I find it is the ranking value I want to get.p  pUnfortunately this requires much memory and computing time for large tables.

Negative 1046 pI am thinking to have a Database that store all projects and their versions both under development lets say on TRUNK and RELEASED on some release branch. So, keeping them so, we can link them and their versions and keep control of all these through an centralized GUI. Like everytime when we change a project version from GUI, all projects versions are changing according with their POMs versions as are stored inside of the Database.p  pAn example would be this Projects A, B, C, D, E, Fp  ul liProject A version 1.0.0 depends of Project B version 2.3.0 and Project C version 1.2.5 li liProject C version 1.2.5 depends of Project D Version 3.1.0li liProject D version 3.1.0 dependes of Project E 1.2.1 and Project F 3.2.4li ul  blockquote precodeA 1.0.0         B 2.3.0         C 1.2.5                   D 3.1.0                            E 1.2.1                            F 3.2.4 codepre blockquote  pandp  ul liProject A version 1.1.0 depends of Project B version 2.4.0 Project C version 1.3.5 li liProject C version 1.3.5 depends of Project D Version 3.2.0  li liProject D version 3.2.0 dependes of Project E 1.3.1 and Project F 3.3.4li ul  blockquote precode  A 1.1.0           B 2.4.0           C 1.3.5                     D 3.2.0                              E 1.3.1                              F 3.3.4 codepre blockquote  pSo, when we change the Project A version from the UI, all the dependencies versions are changing accordingly, based on the Database stored versions and links between projects. So that you have the big picture every time when youre curious to see how your project version si looking from the dependecies perspective and what projects versions have been changed from a release to another.p  pOn the other hand, this maybe could be extended like when we want to perform a project release, we should just change versions through UI and these changes are passed to the projects POMs.p  pIs this a feasible idea from your perspective, guys Thanksp

Negative 1046 pI have a Silverlight application that loads extremely slow from IIS. When I debug it takes about 5 seconds to load, where as from the server it takes over a minute. The size of the xap is only 8 MB, which does not seem particularly large to me, and although I have heard others talk about reducing the amount of media in the xap, my app only contains three low res icons, which should not have much impact. I have tested this from internet connections from 10Mbps to 24Mbps and there does not seem to be a whole lot of difference. Due to frequent changes, I have disabled application caching so that updates go through, but allowing caching still would not help the 12 minute load times for first time users not exactly a great first impression.p  pNeedless to say, this has left me with a few questionsp  ul liDoes this sound like a hardwareIIS issue or something that I have control over from the application side of things. li liIs an 8MB xap file larger than a typical xap li liWhat could cause the difference between the debug load times and the deployed load timesli liI cannot imagine this is the case, but is a 1 minute start up time to be expectedli ul

If an another call for the same class with the same arguments       is made we return the object.           private static cache      public static function callStaticclass, args           1 we check if the class already exists in the cache               2 if it does then we return the object in the cache               3.1 otherwise we create a new object              3.2 we pass to the constructor of that object the arguments with ReflectionClass              3.3 we store the class name, arguments and object in the cache        codepre  pAnd a concrete classp  precodeclass My extends Factory  codepre  pAnd lets assume we have a class codeDontKnowarg1, arg2code that accept arguments codearg1code and codearg2code to the constructor.

If we call it again our factory class will not instantiate a new object, but will use the same again. p  pSo for example if we set codeMyDontKnowsample, 3gtsetSomethingkey, myvaluecode and inside another scope we call  codeMyDontKnowsample, 3gtgetSomethingkeycode it will print codemyvaluecode.p  pBut if we call codeMyDoNotcode the factory class will return a singleton object of the class DoNot that, since our factory class codeMycode is static, has static scope and can be, then, called everywhere.p  pIsnt this another example of Singleton Is this to avoid as well as the Singleton patternp

I might be able to get away with sayingp  precodemsgproc Window, rightClick...  msgproc Button, buttonClick... codepre  pThe problem is in the fact that I have to call these procedures and give them the right codehwndcode. My main window procedure is implemented in my codeWindowcode class. It gets the four normal arguments. If I need to pass on a codeWMCOMMANDcode message to the right button procedure, Id like to give it the corresponding codeButtoncode object.p  pThe way it is currently, I pass a pointer to the superclass of both codeWindowcode and codeButtoncode. Of course it creates convoluted code such asp  precodeWindow hwndgtoperator get HWND of the Window codepre  pIt doesnt seem to really work that well anyways. Unfortunately, the only way I can think of at the moment to do so is to keep a list of every codeButtoncode created and pull the right one out. I could even extend this to all possible recipients.p  pThe advantage to doing it this way is that my codeButtoncode class has a static window procedure that is called any time a codeWMCOMMANDcode message is found. I havent added other controls, but it is designed to work by checking the id with existing ones and calling the procedure you specify when you create the button if its a match. The thing is, when this is done, any other things like a checkbox that add the codeWMCOMMANDcode handler will be called as well.p  pI was thinking of keeping a list in codeWindowcode of every HWND child and its corresponding object. This way I can just nuke the extra procedures in every class like the codeButtoncode, which will cause a lot of extra processing to occur, and replace codeproc [i] BaseWindow hwnd, msg, wParam, lParamcode with something like codeproc [i] control [lowordwParam], msg, wParam, lParamcode for codeWMCOMMANDcode, using codelParamcode to see whether its a control.p  pIt seems like Im missing something big though. Chances are Ill start to implement this and then run into a major problem. Is there a better way to do all of thisp  pWhile Im at it, is there a way to make a codecontrolcode function that returns the correct object type Button, Checkbox... depending on which one it finds the id to correspond to instead of just an array of varying objects which Im pretty sure Ive seen a way to dop

Negative 1046 pI have a c web application where I need to dynamically generate controls, and where the actions on the controls also affect which controls will be rendered. Imagine for example a list of buttons, where each button should remove itself and its reference in the database. I have the feeling I dont understand something quite basic here at least it should bep  pI would like to use event handlers here. However, the question is then where should I generate the controls, in PageLoad or PreRender If I generate them in pageload the event handlers havent fired yet so the generated content isnt up to date yet. I can also generate it in PreRender but then the event handlers dont fire because the controls dont exist yet.p  pWhat would be the preferred way of handling this I really want to avoid the option to modify the generated content later, it is way too errorprone in my case. I would like to generate all content from scratch, right after the events have been handled. Currently I solve this partially by examining the request.form before the generation of the controls but I have quite a lot of actions and its not really a workable solution in quite some cases already.p

Negative 1046 pAccording to the R Memorylimits documentation, it isnt possible to allocate a vector of length longer than 2311. This is because the integer used as an index can only use 31 bits one bit for the sign. But on a 64bit system, I should be able to allocate longer vectors. Why does R impose this same max length on 64bit systems Is there a way to circumvent the limitp
Negative 1046 pI am trying to return a HTTP header together with XML stating whether a process has been successful or not.  p  pThis all appeared to be working fine whilst developing my API, I was making test calls to the API from the same server and getting the relevant header status code together with the XML.

If there is an error, I receive the header status code OK but get no error XML.

Negative 1046 pWe are having an issue with logging in a second time on our site ever since we installed the lightspeed module.  At first I thought this might have to do with the need for hole punching, but now Im not sure. If you try to log into our website the first time, it works well.  However, if you log in a second time, it wont work.  It just remains on the customeraccountlogin page with no effect.p  pI tried to test this on my end, and echoed the users email in the loginPost function in the account controller.  When echoing directly from the controller, it was obvious that the user was being logged in, but upon the redirect to a page on the site, the user was no longer logged in and appeared as a Guest in the Magento backend where you view online customers.p  pIt appears to me as if the session is being lost after the redirect.  I am not sure if this has anything to do with a switch between https and http as described in the stackoverflow problem here httpstackoverflow.comquestions7823994magentosessionlostwhenswitchingtohttpsfromhttp  where they had also installed lightspeed.  The person there resolved the problem, but did not post the solution.  Their problem wasnt the same as ours, but I was thinking there may be a connection between the two.p  pHas anyone seen a problem like this beforep  pThanks in advance,p  pBrendap

The program will launch in a Java applet, and I want it to accept input from an announcements.txt file which will be what we edit with new announcements and then display it in the applet. I am using the latest version of NetBeans to stumble my way through this.p  pThe program will be added to a group policy in Active Directory to launch at login for all employees.p  pMy questions arep  ol lipCan I just use FileOutputStream to write the announcements.txt to a TextArea Ive only ever dealt with console applications.pli lipI added a ScrollPane to the applet design, and just placed a TextArea over top of it. Is this how it is meant to be done Will it automatically insert scroll bars when it goes outside the window or am I supposed to output the text directly to the ScrollPanepli ol  pSorry if this all seems kind of basic. Im an aspiring programmer, but Ive got a LOT of work ahead of me before I become even semiproficient. ANY INPUT IS APPRECIATEDp

Negative 1046 pIm crawling a web site only two levels deep, and I want to scrape information from sites on both levels. The problem Im running into, is I want to fill out the fields of one item with information from both levels. How do I do thisp  pI was thinking having a list of items as an instance variable that will be accessible by all threads since its the same instance of the spider, and parse1 will fill out some fields, and parse2 will have to check for the correct key before filling out the corresponding value. This method seems burdensome, and Im still not sure how to make it work.p  pWhat Im thinking is there must be a better way, maybe somehow passing an item to the callback. I dont know how to do that with the Request method though. Ideasp
Negative 1046 pI have an issue with a game Ive been making for Android with Air. The app orients itself correctly staying in landscape up until I lock the phone Im testing with and then unlock it. When the phone unlocks, the app will then be in portrait mode it should always be in landscape.p  pIn the descriptor xml file I have set fullscreen to true, aspect ratio to landscape and auto orient to false but this doesnt seem to affect the app when being locked and unlocked it works perfectly in any other scenario. It will become portrait again and not move back to landscape when unlocked so auto orient being false definitely isnt being meddled with.p  pThis issue only triggers when youre running the game and lock the phone and unlock. If for example you were to press the home button so the app is no longer in focus, then lock and unlock and get back into the paused game it will still be in landscape.p  pEDIT Ive just made an important discovery It seems this is dependant on what kind of lock screen you use on your phone. I use an android 4 galaxy s3. I switched it to not use a lock screen and the app stayed in landscape when I unlocked This is progress. Unfortunately my friend who has a different android 4.0 phone has reported the same issue so its not just my phone.p

Negative 1046 pI have been using Netbeans for several months now and like it a lot.  I am trying to enable a way to create a project which accesses live files on my server to make changes.  When I create a project using a remote source, it starts downloading all the server files to my computer.  This would be just fine, except for the fact that a the server has a few gigs of files on it and b there are two of us that will be making changes on the server.p  pIn the past, I have worked with IDEs that just open an FTP or SFTP connection and will download the file you want to edit, and then upload that file back to the server when you save it.  Preferably, this is what I would like Netbeans to do.p  pI have tried adding a FTP folder in Windows, but Netbeans wont open it.  I have tried using Swish and setting up an SFTP folder, and Netbeans wont find the Swish folder altogether.p  pOn a side note, I understand what I am doing is horrible practice, but it is a small site and I am usually the only one working on it.  I havent worked on the website in the past several weeks and just thought it would be easier to get access directly than redownloading the entire servers worth of codeimagesvideosetc.  Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 1046 pI am working on a project which requires me to visualize a rather complicated type of data see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq11297061328725this older questiona. In short, I have a large chunk of data which I can export to JSON, CSV or some other arbitrary flat format although I prefer to avoid XML if possible see the linked question above for indetail explanation of the underlying data.p  pI have started working on a visualization using D3, the layout I wrote seems to work OK so far when I test it with some very simple data that I hardcode in the Javascript as an array. The tutorials I read on data binding in D3 have been a bit confusing in the sense that some use JSON and some use TXTCSV format while some others use hardcoded arraysmatrices. p  pIn the case of JSON, I watched a tutorial where the narrator firmly advises to host the JSON file on a webserver and get it using a HTTP request instead of a local file read. I realize that this is due to cross domain request limitations, which I believe I have to workaround somehow. At this point I am not sure how to proceed since p  ol lipThe D3powered visualization will be on a series of HTML reports which are created as results of an analysis tool I wrote. The analysis is done on the users computer, and the HTML reports are also created locally on the clientside.pli lipThe intended users are most definitely not techsavvy, so it is not an option to instruct them to run an webserver on their computer to be able to serve JSON or any other type or resource via localhostpli ol  pFor the record, I have tried running the python SimpleHTTPServer module to try it out, and again everything works fine. I then tried to hardcode the data in the generated HTML reports, then call on the JSON object from my script which uses D3, p  precoded3.jsonmydata.json, functionjson d3.jsonmyjson, functionjson     nodeData  json.elements ....  codepre  pwhich fails since in that case I end up sending in a JSON object while D3.js is expecting a URL.p  pWhat can I do to avoidsolve this problemp

Negative 1046 pInside every aggregate the consistence must be guaranteed. It is easy to do it in the repository because I can always use transactions from the database or framework. I have doubts about what happens outside the repository. A service might need to work with more than one aggregate to process a request. There could be problems during the processing in the service or while the aggregates are persisted.p  pIf something goes wrong during the processing in the service I could raise an exception. That way the operation will be atomic. This is my first concern. Is that a good practice The problem I see is that it will be hard to recover from that. There will be no easy way to leave all the aggregates with the state they had before the failed operation.p  pThe other problem I have is what happens if one of the aggregates fails to be persisted. How do I ensure the consistency of the information Do I have to use database transactions outside the repositories I was thinking that it might not be the best solution because I should not be thinking in the database when I am designing the domain model.p

So Im logging the object on one line, seeing it in the console, trying to access a property I just confirmed exists and getting codeundefinedcode.p  pHere is my functionp  precodethis.preloadData  functionfolders      var getString     forvar folder in folders         getString  folderfolders[folder]ampuriuriampthumbSideoptions.thumbSide        .getoptions.handler, getString,           functionresponse, serverStat, xhr                        self.datafolder, response                    for      var selfData  self.data      console.logselfDataObject editorial  data, testingdata  some meaningless words      console.logself.dataObject editorial  data, testingdata  some meaningless words      console.logself.data.editorialundefined      console.dirself.dataeditorialundefined      console.logselfData[editorial]undefined      console.logselfData.editorialundefined        self.datatestingdata, some meaningless words      console.logself.dataObject editorial  data, testingdata  some meaningless words      console.logself.datatestingdatasome meaningless words   codepre  pI know the namespacing is too simple, I just tried to cut out as many factors as I could to try and understand why this isnt working. I feel like Im living in the twilight zone. I really hope Im just being stupid. Im developing in chrome but Ive tried it in firefox also and get the same crap.p  pEDITp  pOk, I WAS being a little stupid. I understand what the problem is now. The console reflects all changes to an object that get made regardless of if they were made when the object was logged. So when I logged the object the property didnt exist yet because the response had yet to come back from the server, but the log still shows the property as existing because at some later point in the script execution it DID exist. Because primitive values arent logged in the same way, the call to log the property shows up as codeundefinedcode because it WAS undefined. If I refer to the property some seconds later, say on a click event it is definedwhich is how I intended it to work anyway. I just got really caught up in debugging this function before I actually implemented it. Well Im stupid cause I just wasted a whole lot of time since it already worked exactly how I wanted it to. Oh well, live and learn.p

Negative 1046 pI have an sqlite3 database that is loaded inside a tableview. I have also a search feature that is working correctly. I want whenever i select a cell, i will be redirected to the view controller Details, and printing inside it the details concerning the item selected. I have tried to trace the selected item with indexpath.row, but whenever i perform a search, normally, the indexpath.row will automatically change. So therefore i am stuck , how to pass a unique variable from the selected row to the details VC. i really hope someone will take the time and read the code, i have been jammed for almost 2 weeks on the same error. The tableView is assigned to the class  AuthorVC The detail View is assigned to the class  Detailsbrbr ibDetails.mbi   p  precode   Details.m   AuthorsApp    Created by georges ouyoun on 71712.

Negative 1046 pAfter reading a number of questions regarding abstract classes and interfaces, I am still unsure about how I should go about designing my code, so at the risk of having missed a possible duplicate, heres my situation. p  pI am working on a number of utility classes that are meant to handle a nasty hierarchy of a particular type of object. While the precise details of the object is irrelevant, it should suffice to say that its not a general solution whatsoever. So I started by writing a codeCustomNodecode and a codeCustomHierarchycode class. p  pA bit later on I realized that its much smarter to produce a more general solution, which can be reused in different context and easily tested without having to create lots of mock instances of the aforementioned complicated class. I could easily provide all the common code in interfaces and abstract classes, and just provide the specific bits where they are needed this I believe is the whole point with OOPp  pSo far I havep  ul lipan interface codeRelatablecode which simply holds an enum of possible relations that nodes might have to one another, and a method signature of codegetRelationRelatable othercodepli lipan abstract class codeNodeltEgtcode which implements the codeRelatablecode and contains all utility methods e.g. codeaddChildcode or codegetNextSiblingcode. The only method this class is missing is the codegetRelationRelatable othercode. pli lipa concrete class codeHierarchyltEgtcode which will define how to build up the hierarchy of the nodes, starting from a codeCollectionltEgtcode which holds the data.pli ul  pThe idea is to extend the codeNodeltEgtcode and codeHierarchyltEgtcode classes with appropriate subclasses based on the problem at hand. The first two are done without any major hustle but I am having problems with the codeHierarchyltEgtcode class since it has a emprivateem method codeaddNodeToHierarchyE datacode which tries to instantiate a codeNodeltEgtcode and place it in the hierarchy. This obviously fails as the node class is abstract and cant be instantiated. p  pI understand why this is not working, but I am not sure how I should go about circumventing this problem. Is there a flaw in my design Should I add a static codecreateNewNodeE datacode method in the codeNodeltEgtcode and use that instead Another option I can think of is to detach the codeNodecode from getting the relation and go with a codeRelatorcode interface instead. This cant be a unique problem by any chance, so whats good practice in this situationp  pThanks in advance,p

After that, I click on the Tumblr button, which calls the webview enabling me to connect to my session. But when I come back to my app, the partial view has been removed from superview.p  pSo I was wondering if I had to set something special in my callback URL, cause for now, its just  MyAppNameShare knowing that the Share is just for putting something. Either way, I just get redirected to the default URL, which is the Tumblr Homep  pThanks for help.p

Negative 1046 pI have a primary Nexus OSS server that stores our build artifacts as well as proxies Central and various other sites. To speed up access at one of our remote sites with relatively poor connectivity to the Internet, I am setting up a server to proxy the primary server. p  pWe do not want to allow anonymous access to the primary server, so I created a proxy user on the primary server with readview access to all of the repositories. I then configured repositories on the new server to proxy the primary server, using the proxy user for access. However, the new server cannot fetch information from the primary server. I get RemoteAuthenticationNeededException Unauthorized.p  pI think that the proxy user may not have the correct privileges on the primary server, but I cant figure out what privileges the proxy user requires. If I grant the proxy user UI Base UI privileges and UI Repository Browser privileges, the user can, indeed, view the appropriate repositories.p

Negative 1046 pI am refactoring a pretty large code base. In the old way, there are two libraries codeFooFactorycode and codeBarLibcode. codeBarLibcode depends on codeFooFactorycode which in turn depends on a lot of codeFoo1code, codeFoo2code, codeFoo3code code etc... when built, codeFooFactorycode pulls in all the codeFoocode dependencies and then codeBarLibcode can use codeFooFactorycode to request construction of, say, a codeFoo7code. In my refactoring, I am making all the codeFooXcode guys depend on codeFooFactorycode and not the other way around, and register themselves statically if the makefile happens to link them. codeBarLibcode still depends on codeFooFactorycode but will only succeed in creating codeFoo7code if it was linked and thus registered statically into the codeFooFactorycode.p  pI am running into the following problemp  pThere is a special codeFoo14code, which the main factory file codeFooFactory.Ccode in codeFooFactorycode constructs with a string that codeBarLibcode sets. The way this works is that codeFooFactory.Hcode exposes a global function called codesetStringconst stdstringampcode and in the code.Ccode file it has a codestdstring theStringcode variable in an anonymous namespace. Then a method in codeBarLibcode may or may not use this function to set this string. And in the corpus of codeFooFactory.Ccode, this string is checked during the construction of codeFoo14code.p  pThe issue is, with the dependency reversed, all the construction code for the codeFoocode guys is kept inside their respective libraries and only summoned if they have statically registered. I have no simple way of passing this codestdstringcode down to codeFoo14code because it abides by a common interface of arguments passed for constructing a codeFoocode. If I place the string codetheStringcode in codeFoo14.Ccode then that would force codeBarLibcode to depend on codeFoo14code in order to set it...so I was wondering if I could keep it in codeFooFactory.Ccode, but in codeFoo14code declare it as extern and make use of it. Would this work even if codetheStringcode is in an anonymous namespace of codeFooFactory.Ccode Or would it now have to be a global living in the header Or what is an alternative solutionp

Negative 1046 pI am working on a program that plays music in the background via multithreading, because the GUI freezes up otherwise. I have a basic knowledge of multithreading volatile, synchronizing, etc. but I was wondering how to immediately stoppause a thread even when processes are processing.

So my question remains, from the parent thread is there any way to immediately pause or terminate the music in the middle of the song, because I have audio to play after it.p

Negative 1046 pA little retrospective now that Ive settled into Mercurial. Forget forget files combined with codehg removecode. Its crazy and bassackwards. You can use codehg removecode once youve established that something is in a forget file that isnt forgetting because the item in question was tracked before the original repo was created. Note that codehg removecode effectively clears tracked status but it also schedules the file for deletion in anything that gets changes from your repo. If ignored, however the tracking deactivation still happens but that deleteme change set wont ever reach another repo and for some reason will never delete in yours which IMO is counterintuitive. It is a very sure sign that somebody and I dont know these guys, is UNWILLING TO COMPROMISE ON DUH DESIGN PROBLEMS. The important thing to understand is that you dont determine whats important, Mercurial does. Except when youre merging on a pull of course. Its entirely reasonable then. But I digress...p  pIgnorefileremove is a good combo for alreadytracked but very specific files you want forgotten but if youre dealing with a larger quantity of built files determined with broader patterns its not worth the risk. Just go with a doublerepo and codepull ucode from the remote repo to your syncing repo and then codepull ucode commits from your working repo and merge in a repo whose sole purpose is to merge changes and pass them on in a place where your notquite tracked or untracked files behavior is different when pulling rather than pushing of course because hey, why be consistent wont cause frustration. Trust me. The idea that you should have to have two repos just to get er done offends for good reason AND THAT SO MANY OF US ARE DOING IT should suggest a serioush ing design problem, but its much less painful than all the other awful things that will make you regret seeking a sensible alternative.p  pAnd use codehg helpcode.

Negative 1046 pId like to place a POD type constrain on type parameter codeTcode of class template codeAcode and then derive another class template codeBcode from the satisfactory codeAcode. Besides, codeBcode is supposed to have different implementation according to constancy of instance of codeAcode.

Negative 1046 pIm just getting started in music editing from a programming standpoint and I understand a lot of the ideas around waveforms and things of that nature, but Im stuck on the issue of how to read a single sample from a sound file as an array of bytes.  p  pIm using the Alvas.Audio library a hrefhttpwww.alvas.netalvas.audio.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.alvas.netalvas.audio.aspxa and C, if that helps to answer the question.p  pI understand that different file formats have different ways of storing the data, but my main problem revolves around how to programmatically determine how that data is stored and iterate through the file one sample at a time.  I will probably be converting all the files to .wav format using the Alvas library, so an answer specifically for the wav format would suffice, but Im still curious about iterating samples when the file is in stereo.  From what I understand, files with stereo data store parallel samples consecutively.p  pMy end goal is to be able to get the samples from a certain time period of the song a few seconds at some place in the song and then perform some math or other stuff on them, but Im just never sure that what I have read in is actually the right data.p

Negative 1046 pWe have a worker role which processes records and sends Azure service bus messages as needed based on the results of the query, this is basically a queue processing service.

Negative 1046 pI am working on a project that revolves around multiprecision complex numbers, specifically its a Mandelbrot Setbased app, but with a twist that requires decent correspondence between the output of a fast C py extension module boost, cython, or other... and the pure python modules that might want to use it.p  pRight now, Im using boostmultiprecision to wrap the MPFR raw type, and yeah if I just wanted to pass an mpfrt to python thatd be one thing. However, for this app I need to store the C modules result as a string which will be eminterpretedem later by a Python module, and needs to give the same number.p  pBigFloat is supposed to be an MPFR python wrapper, but it doesnt interpret a string literal of an Xprecision float emexactlyem the same way as boostmultiprecisions data method.p  pDoes anybody know of a combination of libraries plus an approach that emdoesem result in an exact correspondence between C and Python string literals of arbitraryprecision floatingpoint numbersp  pI can provide code excerpts if needed to illustrate the problem, but figured it was arcane enough that if anybody had the answer, theyd know exactly what I mean and how to fix it.p

In general, I dont have a problem with the buffering, so Im not looking to turn on autoflush or anything... but I noticed that messages that are logged before I call codeforkcode are duplicated, and Im wondering if its because they are buffered, the buffer gets duplicated when the process image is copied, and then both processes eventually write their buffer copies to the log file...p  pSo basically, Id like to just do a manual flush on the log, one time only, immediately before I call codeforkcode in order to be sure no messages are still sitting in memory. In other words, Im looking for something akin to codefflushcode, code.flushcode, codeltlt flushcode, etc. that I can use on a boost log.p  pI did try using codeltlt flushcode with the log, but I still get the duplicated messages, so Im not 100 sure whether its flushing and the duplicates are caused by some other problem, or if it somehow silently ignores the codeltlt flushcode...p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI was looking around and found that boost log is not forksafe. So I should add that I am emnotem trying to use the same log in parent and child processes. I have two forking scenarios  in one, the parent terminates immediately and child contineus so that should be safe, and in the other, the child should open its own separate log file, so that should be safe also... but Id need to figure out how to emcloseem a log file sink and then open a new one on a different file. I suppose closing the sink may also be a way to force a flush...p

But while this flashing and blinking is going on , my app is frozen up. The Blinking SOS is perfect. But it doesnt respond to any button clicks or even Back Button to stop it midway.p  pI reckon this is because the threadUI is sleeping hence it doesnt care about what the user is doing... But the click surely is registered, and if according to android if it isnt looked after in the stipulated period of time I think a few seconds ... The app goes ANR.p  pSo, I need brief pauses with intervals defined by me As above I use 300 milliseconds.

The problem seems to be, it does wait 300 millisecondsin my case ...But I have several postDelay functions  So I think its actually lining up all the functions together, and the waiting period of the 300 milliseconds is somewhat overlapping.

Negative 1046 pMy company is evaluating moving to a new SCM system, and git is one of the final contenders being considered.  Before we began, we came up with a list of usecases that needed to be supported.p  pOne usecase for which I dont have a solid answer with git is simultaneously working on multiple changesets in a single project.p  pIn our current SCM, you associate a file with a task when you check it out.  As long as your changes are in different files, you can have as many tasks active as you want.p  pIn my experience with git, you dont associate changes into a changeset commit until you stage them for commit.  However, there is only one staging area, so you can only do this for one changeset at a time and cant associate a summarydescription yet.p  pThere is also stash, but the typical use of this would be to incorporate multiple logical changes into one build to run tests against, so they need to be simultaneously active.p  pAs I write this post, a possible workflow comes to mind make one commit per changeset as you start it, and commit  rebase isquash it into the appropriate commit as you make further changes.  However, that seems overly complex and likely would not be wellreceived.p  pIs there a better way  Or a compelling justification for why we should stop using this workflow would need to be very compellingp  pThanks in advancep

However, the data is stored in a Windows database and read by Windows clients, so I need codeCRLFcode line breaks.p  pstrongIs there a more elegant way to solve this issue than to manually codes  s.Replacen, rncode every string received via WCFstrong Since WCF has so many options and features, I figured that there might be some hidden codeAutoTranslateNewlinescode option that I have missed...p  hr  pAdditional information My service is declared roughly like thisp  precode[OperationContract] [WebInvokeResponseFormat  WebMessageFormat.Json,            RequestFormat  WebMessageFormat.Json,            UriTemplate  MyServiceUserIdmyUserId] public Reply MyServiceString myUserId, Request someRequest  ...  codepre  pwhere codeRequestcode is a custom class with a few codeStringcode fields, some of which can contain multiple lines of text.p

Negative 1046 pHeres a short version of my situation. My current ISP is not working properly, and as a result, Id like to log ping successes and failures as proof it isnt working. Ill be on Linux, but Windows would be fine too. Ive been reading, and as far as I can tell, a shell script or Python code would work best.p  pSo, being more detailed Id like to do a single ping at a website every 5 seconds. If there is a successful ping, it should output the normal results of the ping to a file. Ping failures however have a long timeout, so Id like to make the program so that if the ping hasnt succeeded in 4 seconds or so, it stops the ping attempt, but still outputs the full ping data with a 1 packet transmitted, 0 received etc, like it would have if it had run out of time.p  pHere is what I have so farp  precodewhile true do     ping c1 w4 www.example.com gtgt log.txt     sleep 5 done codepre  pUnfortunately, there are 2 problems. First, the w4 isnt making it time out after 4 seconds like I thought it would. And second, the sleep adds on to the time already spent. So, if the ping takes 3 seconds, the loop will take 8 seconds. Since I will be writing another program that will count the successes, failures, and output the down time percent, having loops take a lot of extra time on a failure isnt acceptable.p  pSo, given what I need, whats the best way to go about this Can what I have be improved to meed the needs Thank you for any helpp  pPS I know almost nothing about writing shell scripts, though Im competent with a terminal, and I know even less about Python though I know C. Apologies in advancep

Negative 1046 pDoes anyone have an example of applying complex business logic in an application where databinding is usedp  pI have never used data binding because it never fits perfectly into any application.  Even with a simple datacentric WinForms application, there are business rules that apply to WHAT may happen with a record, WHEN it must happen, or WHO may cause it to happen...p  p...maybe a certain user cannot update a record but they may view it.  p  p...maybe a record cannot be updated because of its current status.p  p...maybe a record has an IsDeleted or DateDeleted flag.p  pI have always created classes with very specific operations in a business class and checked security, conditions of the record, and the like.  This makes it very difficult to actually BIND to a collection of objects in the way Microsoft preaches.p  pI would be grateful for any helpful samples or links.p  pThanks, Ryanp

Negative 1046 pI am trying to parse a csv file with C where the separator is codecode using codestrtokcode. The problem is that some fields are empty and thus two separators are placed next to each other.

Negative 1046 pIm having some annoying issues between BootstrapJQuerymy own CSS, tell me if this sounds like a problem you know how to fix. p  pIm implementing my own slider, with AJAX calls loading content onto the page depending on the navigation the user does.

Negative 1046 pI am trying to implement the above community detection algorithm in Java, and while I have access to C code, and the original paper  I cant make it work at all. My major issue is that I dont understand the purpose of the code  i.e. how the algorithm works. In practical terms, my code gets stuck in what seems to be an infinite loop at codemergeBestQcode, the list codeheapcode seems to be getting larger on each iteration as I would expect from the code, but the value of codetopQcode is always returning the same value. p  pThe graph I am testing this on is quite large 300,000 nodes, 650,000 edges. The original code I am using for my implementation is from the SNAP library a hrefhttpsgithub.comsnapstanfordsnapblobmastersnapcorecmty.cpp relnofollowhttpsgithub.comsnapstanfordsnapblobmastersnapcorecmty.cppa. What would be great is if someone could explain to me the intuition of the algorithm, it seems to be initially setting each node to be in its own community, then recording the modularity value whatever that is of each pair of connected nodes in the graph, then finding the pair of nodes which have the highest modularity and moving them to the same community. In addition, if someone could provide some mid level pseudo code, that would be great. Here is my implementation thus far, I have tried to keep it in one file for the sake of brevity, however CommunityGraph and CommunityNode are elsewhere should not be required. Graph maintain a list of all nodes and each node maintains a list of its connections to other nodes. When running it never gets past the line codewhilethis.mergeBestQcodep  pUPDATE  found several bugs in my code after a thorough review. The code now completes VERY quickly, but doesnt fully implement the algorithm, for example of the 300,000 nodes in the graph, it states there are approximately 299,000 communities i.e. roughly 1 node per community. I have listed the updated code below.      ClausetNewmanMoore community detection method.

Negative 1046 pIm a fan of RTS real time stragy game, and im working for a rts game myself I can produce a simple terrain map from trianglequad. with texture tile blending... Now I want to move to a new level. Currently im using only lighting shader, with Phong shading I think with specular,diffuse color... very basic shadingp  pAnd the result is not bad, but still cant compare to current game today like starcraft2, civilization V, shogun 2 campaing map..... For example the terrain in starcraft 2 look very shining, rich color, sharp, and cool. It doesnt need to look reality in this kind of game. It just look nice, beautiful For example  a hrefhttpslh4.googleusercontent.comzNtnsUV02wcUkxFLpKmJJIAAAAAAAAAEEUSuWhYK8JfEw1049h831noTerrain001.jpg relnofollowhttpslh4.googleusercontent.comzNtnsUV02wcUkxFLpKmJJIAAAAAAAAAEEUSuWhYK8JfEw1049h831noTerrain001.jpga a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com0Wb2j.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.com0Wb2j.jpgap  pSo I know that just sampler linearpoint... the texture is not enough even the how nice the texture. There must be some high technique behind for current game. Like Bloom, HDR, directx 11 lighting, Bump Mapping... Cause Im quite new to 3d, so Im not sure what technique is to be used. Just give me the keyword, I can search google for it doc,source code.... Thanksp

Negative 1046 pFirst of all let me try and explain what Im trying to do.p  pI have a calendar with events that are stored in the database, each event is a workday. The important things I save in the database is the user, the date, the week of the year 152 and the hours worked.

Negative 1046 pClimbing the learning curve for creating asp.net webform pages with Visual Studio 2010 VB. p  pI had written a fairly complicated .aspx page with form controls, including textboxes and buttons, etc. I never thought to place the form controls inside a codeltformgtcode block. Instead, all the controls include the runat directive for example, codeltasptextbox idtxtUserName runatservergtcode etc. In the codebehind I access the data with codestrUserName  txtUserName.textcode. This seems to work just fine.p  pNow, though, I received some form pages from our contracted professional web developer wherein the form code is all enclosed in a codeltform runatservergtcodeblock, and none of the controls include the coderunatcode directive. Accessing the data from these controls is a little different It uses the codeltinput typetext nametxtUserName idtxtUserName gtcode method, and accessing the data in the codebehind  is codestrUserName  Request.FormtxtUserName.ToStringcode.p  pMy method seems to work fine, but I am wondering if there is a difference in behavior or reliability between my method and his. Even though my way works, am I doing it wrongp  pMine is based on online research I have done to learn this stuff, and I dont remember seeing anything that looked like his. However, just today I see places that are saying that on .aspx pages, form controls MUST be enclosed in a codeltformgtcode block i.e., a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comASPnetaspnetforms.asp relnofollowthis page at w3schools.coma.p  pCan anyone clarify this for mep  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 1046 pI am building an MVC 4 project in which I display a table of projects and their several status milestones. Each milestone is represented by a cell colored either green, yellow or red. I build these cells content using an html helper to present textual content on top of the colored background using some fairly complex logic. I want to allow the user to click on any of the cells and pop up a jQuery dialog displaying the details pertinent to that status item using a partial view. Each cell has the same css class which I use to bind a click event and then send an ajax call to the server, passing the id of the cell. The call is being received as expected by the controller method but the ajax call is failing.  The sending view has been built using one data model to populate the cells and of course I need to send a different data model to the partial view and I dont know if the mismatch is the reason for the fail, I dont think so. I am trying to do the development using simple data just to get it working so I have tried sending back just a value or a keyvalue pair as Json and each way fails.p  pHeres the jsp  precode.statusCell.clickfunction           var statusId  this.id         alertclicked this status   statusId          var request  .ajax             url ReportGetStatusData,             data                  id statusId                                 request.successfunction data              alertreturned ajax data   data                  request.failfunction jqXHR, textStatus              alertRequest failed   textStatus           codepre  pThe fail function is displaying just as you would expect in a fail. Here is the controller code in which I have tried several return attemptsp  precodepublic ActionResult GetStatusDataint id      return Jsonnew  prop  id      return PartialViewdisplayStatus, id  codepre  pThe problem is I dont really know what I need to do on a detailed level. I understand the general concept but not what is actually going on. I have done ajax calls in the past but using ActionLinks with Ajax within them with partial views as the success target. This is different enough that it eludes me.  What do I need to return to the view so that I can pass the new data to the partial view and load it Can I not send back what ever model I need What form does it need to be in that I have missed I might mention that I have not yet written the code for the partial, as I wanted to get this working first. But I dont see why not having a view to receive the new data should matter since I havent mapped them together. I appreciate any help anyone can offer.p

Negative 1046 pIm implementing a kind of a compass arrow that follows destination depending on physical orientation of the device using magnetic field sensor. Suddenly I faced with a little problem.p  pObtaining bearing and azimuth is OK, but performing a realistic animation turned into a really hard task. I tried to use different interpolators to make animation more physical i. e. as in real compass, which arrow oscillate after hairpin rotation, accelerate and decelerate during movement etc.p  pNow Im using codeinterpolator.acceleratedeceleratecode and everything is quite good until updates start arriving quickly. That makes animations overlap each other and the arrow becomes twitchy and nervous. I want to avoid this. I tried to implement a queue to make every next animation wait until previous ends, or drop updates that come very quickly. That made animation look smooth, but arrows behavior turned into absolutely illogical. p  pstrongSo I have 2 questionsstrongp  p1 is there some way to emmake animated transitions more smooth in the cases when animations overlap each otherem p  p2 is there a way to emstop animation that is currently processing and get intermediate position of an objectemp  pMy code is below.

I do not want to do either of these.p  pHow can I ensure that updating codeaddresscode will make codemodelcode becomes emdirtyem as wellp  hr  h3Updateh3  pInstead of calling codesavecode on both the child and parent objects, I found a better way by looking through the source for embermodelp  precode            console.log                 model.getisDirty, model.getisDirty, false                 address.getisDirty, address.getisDirty true                           model.getaddress.save             if address.getisDirty                  model.relationshipBecameDirtyaddress                          console.log                 model.getisDirty, model.getisDirty, true                 address.getisDirty, address.getisDirty true                          model.save codepre  pThis ensures atomicity is preserved, however calling a private method directly like this does not seem right. Is there a better wayp  pCurrently the only usages of this method  coderelationshipBecameDirtycode  are in codehasmanyarray.jscode in embermodel, and I was not able to find any instance in codebelongsto.jscode.

Perhaps theres a software engineering reason for the decision. I suspect theres a good reason, and I lack the insight to see it at the moment.p  pWhy does Java lack the ability to configure the codeSSLSocketFactorycode Its clearly a design decision, and Im trying to understand why it was made at the expense of security in a relevant portion of the library.p

Negative 1046 pAlright, so for the past two days, Ive been scouring the internet and trying my best to put together a rather sophisticated login system. Ive got the core of it working, users can sign up, and login. Im not new to simple php and mysql, but when it comes to indepth code like this Im lost. Basically what I want is to have the users enter their login, then have it verified obviously and I have that done, then be redirected to a members page that displays information pertaining to their usernameaccount only. Ive registered some session variables on the checklogin.php the file where I verify the log ins, please look below, but for the life of me I cannot get the variables passed to the actual members page. So I figured Id start easy. Id just try and transfer the username and display a welcome message Hello there, [username used to login here]. I cannot get that far.

Negative 1046 pWell, I found this question answered several times. The answer is pretty common too. strongstatic synchronized methodstrong locks on the emClassem where synchronized method locks on the eminstanceem itself.p  pAnd two different thread of same class can not call two different strongsynchronized methodstrong simultaneously. If calls then one is blocked. Same things happen for strongstatic synchronized methodstrong. So it seems to me that both cases are showing same usability. It will be very much helped if anyone kindly marks the difference in case of usability of these two types of methods.p

Negative 1046 pIm wondering whether it is possibleadvisable to use instances of a laravel model instead of using the Facade. Why all this trouble I have a model which will be used with many tables, and i want to be setting the models codetablecode automatically using the constructor. Is it possibleadvisable, or what is the best approach of achieving the same end br I have researched around with no much success.p  pUPDATEbr THis is the scenario an exam system, where different exams are created. after an exam is created, a table is created in the database under the name codeExamcode, where codecode is the ID of the exam. I want to access all exam from one model codeExamcode, but you see the particular table the model is to use can vary significantly, so we cannot set the codetablecode variable statically. The model shall not know the table it will use until itthe model is called. So thats why i was wondering whether i can be passing the codeIDcode of the exam when i am calling the codemodelcode or something like that. I hope my question is now more clear.p

Negative 1046 pI want to make codeexeccode calls with some amount of shell functionality.

Still, it would be preferable to directly determine how a shell on the current machine would behave.p  pI dont simply want to run a shell command. I want to retain control of the rest of the execution context, for example, file descriptors.p  pSpecifically, Im interested in if there is a simple way to apply brace expansion, tilde expansion, variable expansion, word splitting, filename expansion, and quote removal.p  pIm not asking how to implement a shell. My question is if theres a system call on linux platforms to just do these things or any other way to programmatically access the command line parsing of a shell.p  pThe goal is to create a program that will be given a string that specifies an executable to run and the arguments for that executable. The program will run the specific executable by fork and exec then communicate with it through stdin and stdout. This question is only asking about the handling of the string that specifies the executable and arguments. Is there a simple way to parse a command line string as a shell wouldp  pTo get shell command line parsing functionality, it is possible to feed shell scripts or sh c  style commands to the program. However, if there exists a system functionality to parse a command line and make the result viewable programmatically that would be preferable. Does that exist If so, what is itp  pThe target OS is linux. The shell of primary interest is bash. Portability is preferable but not necessary.p

The website for the scroller isp  pa hrefhttprascarlito.free.frhoverscroll relnofollowhttprascarlito.free.frhoverscrollap  pAccording to the site the markup has a fixed width set.

Negative 1046 pI am trying to read a binary ieee file created by wgrib. I have a bunch of GRIB files from the ECMWF center, and I convert them to binary ieee.

However, if you are at an edge and start scrolling toward the edge, the whole document gets overflow scrolled instead. This has two annoying effects You must wait for scrolling to stop before you can actually scroll the scrollable div again, and you dont see the proper background color.

The code is originally from 2011, could it be that the script opens all doors because it is 2014 now Ive tried to find anything about the year, but cant find anything.

Negative 1046 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIve used a few Oracle articles to develop an error package, which consists of five procedures.p  pTwo of these are emLogAndReturnem and emLogAndContinueem. They are called throughout the program. Each takes input and passes it to the emHandleem procedure. For examplep  precodePROCEDURE LogAndReturn errorname IS BEGIN     Handle errorname, TRUE, TRUE END LogAndReturn  codepre  pThe emHandleem procedure then calls the emLogem procedure and the emRaiseToApplicationem procedure depending on the variables passed to it, like sop  precodePROCEDURE Handle errorname, logerror, reraiseerror     IS BEGIN      Code to fetch error code and message using errorname input parameter.     IF logerror THEN         LOG errorcode, errormessage     END IF      IF inreraiseerror THEN         RaiseToApplication errorcode, errormessage     END IF     END Handle codepre  pThe log procedure stores the date, stacktrace, error code, error message and id and finally the emRaiseToApplicationem procedure does what is saysp  precoderaiseapplicationerror errorcode, errormessage codepre  pstrongProblemstrongp  pMy problem is this. Lets say I have a procedure, which performs a query, e.g. fetching a customer record. If this query fails, its a big problem. So I could do thisp  precodeBEGIN         SELECT something     FROM some table     WHERE some field  some user input       more logic  EXCEPTION WHEN NODATAFOUND THEN     ERR.LogAndReturnunknownid   WHEN OTHERS THEN     ERR.LogAndReturnunknownerror   END codepre  pHere, my emLogAndReturnem procedure takes the input, goes off to a table and returns a string to display to the user. Ive a specific error for if the query doesnt find the users record and a generic error for an unknown error. In both cases, logging is performed which takes the full stacktrace of the error.p  pHowever, in my example Ive got a  more logic section. Lets say, I amend the code to thisp  precodeBEGIN         SELECT something INTO some variable     FROM some table     WHERE some field  user id      CallAnotherProcedureuser id, some variable  EXCEPTION WHEN NODATAFOUND THEN     ERR.LogAndReturnunknownid   WHEN OTHERS THEN     ERR.LogAndReturnunknownerror   END codepre  pNow, after the select query, Im calling another procedure with the result of the select query. Inside this emnewem query, Im doing a few things, including an emupdateem statement, like sop  precode bunch of logic  BEGIN     UPDATE another table     SET some field  some value     WHERE some field  variable passed into method EXCEPTION WHEN NODATAFOUND THEN     Err.LogAndReturnsomeerror END codepre  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pMy problem here is that I throw the emNODATAFOUNDem error if the query returns no results, I log the problem and I then raise an application error in my RaiseToApplication procedure... which will then be caught by the when others clause in the parent procedure, which will return the wrong message to the user.p  pstrongWhat is the workaround to thisstrong Note If more code needs to be posted, just let me know.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pOne workaround I had considered, and Ive no idea if this is recommended or not, would be to wrap every stored procedure with a BEGIN END EXCEPTION block, where every procedure had a When Others block that just logged and reraised the most recent error i.e. using SQLCODE. Then, in my application layer I could specify that if the error is between 20000 and 20999, show it along with its message, otherwise show a generic message and the DBA can find out what happened in the database by looking at the log table, along with a full stacktrace. Any thoughts on thisp  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pIf anything doesnt make sense, I can clarify. Ive heavily changed and simplifier the code to remove things like id parameters and a few other things.p

Negative 1046 pI created a DataRow and set it equal to the row of the DataSet that is the equivalent current row of the grid. I want to isolate the original preedited values so I can revert back to these values in the grid if the user cancels the edits for that row. But the grid seems to be bound to the DataSet so that it is not isolating the original preedited cell values. I coded so it only creates the DataRow once in the CellBeginEdit event. But each time I edit a cell, the DataRow is changing and reflecting the new edited values.

Negative 1046 pI am wondering if you can help me with a date problem I have.p  pI have a text box called txtDay where you enter the day of the month relating to the date of the message you are sending.  This is normally the current date so the 01FEB15 would be 01 and the date would add the current month and year.p  pHowever, there are occasions when you need to enter the day for a date of no more than 3 days in the past.  This is not an issue if in the same month but if it for the end of the previous month it thinks it is the end of the current month.p  pSo for example of on the 1st of the month I entered 30, this would be the 30th of the last month but this would only apply to no more than 3 days in the past, any other day would need to be in the future which is OK.p  pThe time is then added from another text box called txtSTD.  This is then all passed to dtmSTD.p  pMy code at the moment isp  precode    Dim dtmSTD  DateTime.UtcNow      If txtSTD.Text   Then         MsgBoxPlease enter an STD., MsgBoxStyle.Critical, Me.Text         Return False     ElseIf txtSTD.TextLength lt 4 Then         MsgBoxPlease enter a valid STD., MsgBoxStyle.Critical, Me.Text         Return False     ElseIf txtSTD.TextLength  4 Then         If Not DateTime.TryParseExacttxtDay.Text amp txtSTD.Text, ddHHmm, Nothing, Globalization.DateTimeStyles.None, dtmSTD Then             MsgBoxPlease enter a valid STD., MsgBoxStyle.Critical, Me.Text             Return False         End If     End If codepre  pAny ideas would be appreciatedp  pRegards,p  pAndrewp

Negative 1046 pWe are in the process of considering migrating from a virtual machine with Sql Server web edition to Sql Azure however some very basic and I mean basic tests have me a little concerned about the performance.  I created a DB locally and inserted 10000 rows and it took a few ms, when I connected to a basic Sql Azure database and ran a while loop to insert 10000 rows it took 2 minutes and 20 seconds.  I upgraded the database to Standard 2 S2 and it completed in 40 seconds.  I then inserted 100k rows locally and it completed in 3 seconds, on S2 it took 6 minutes and 41 seconds.p  pI understand this is incredibly basic testing but it certainly concerns me about the performance of Sql Azure.  We currently have a virtual machine with 8 cores and 56gb ram Azure VM D13 hosting around 10 database.

Negative 1046 pIm doing some basic experiments to evaluate synchronized blocks overhead. Im quite perplexes about the results, hence the question.p  pIn the code below, a number of threads test and increment a global counter up to a goal number in a so called critical section.  Moreover, an additional configurable load of work can be executed inside or outside the critical section.p  pPlaying with constants, particularly with codeLOADOFWORKOUTSIDECRITICALSECTIONcode and codeLOADOFWORKINSIDECRITICALSECTIONcode, what Im observing is that the overhead introduced by the synchronized block can be appreciated only for big amounts of work INSIDE the critical section. See these two output examplesp  precodeProcessors 4 NUMOFTHREADS 4 LOADOFWORKOUTSIDECRITICALSECTION 1000000 LOADOFWORKINSIDECRITICALSECTION 100 NUMOFJOBSGOAL 10000 Non synchronized  Goal reached, elapsed time 6370 milliseconds. Synchronized  Goal reached, elapsed time 6355 milliseconds. codepre  pandp  precodeProcessors 4 NUMOFTHREADS 4 LOADOFWORKOUTSIDECRITICALSECTION 100 LOADOFWORKINSIDECRITICALSECTION 1000000 NUMOFJOBSGOAL 10000 Non synchronized  Goal reached, elapsed time 6351 milliseconds. Synchronized  Goal reached, elapsed time 18629 milliseconds. codepre  pAs you can see, the synchronization overhead seems to happen only for high codeLOADOFWORKINSIDECRITICALSECTIONcode. This is not confusing per se and, of course, confirms that keeping critical sections small is a good practice.  But given that, for the good practice, it is uncommon to have big critical sections, this result clashes with the common opinion of avoiding the synchronized keyword in code as much as possible. I would say instead that synchronization keyword is always safe for small amount of work in the critical section.p  pSo Im afraid Im doing something wrong, in my code or in my head. Could you please help me to clarifyp  pBelow is the code Ive used for testing.

Negative 1046 pSo Im pulling apart a website with the frontend already built and have taken on the task of building out the backend, but I am new to django.

Currently all of the images, css, and js is coming through in the file, but the html files are not. I am referencing these html files as name of file.html However, I cannot seem to get these to load unless I move the templates folder into the static folder alongside the css, images, js, etc. and change the reference to statictemplatesname of file.htmlp  pMy project setup is as follows.

Negative 1046 pIn my web application, there are several classes whose instances need an image i.e., photo. Each of these instances can have only one image. Currently, my implementation is that when user creates a new instance, I keep the name of the uploaded file as it is, and record it in the ImageUrl field of the associated table. p  pI feel like this is unnecessary. I can just rename the image with the unique url of the associated instance, and I can implement the programming logic accordingly. For example, if a  users id is 145, then I can record it with this name profilephoto145. Later, when I need to display the users photo, all I need will be the id of the user. If user uploads a new file, I can just overwrite the existing file with the same name.p  pI wonder if this makes sense assuming each instance will have one associated image, and there will be no need to keep track of the previous files.

The a hrefhttpwww.lispworks.comdocumentationlw50CLHSBodymdefgen.htm relnofollowhyperspeca, with its usual clarity, lists codemethodcode as an option for codedefgenericcode, but does not say what it means.p  pDoes the codemethodcode option present a default, or at least, document what you expect the most common use case will be, or does it have additional semantics As a style point, if you expect to define only one method, does it make more sense to define it in the codedefgenericcode form if you can, indeed, do that, or separately in a codedefmethodcode Or does it not make sense to make a generic function in this case at all, and instead use a regular codedefuncodep

Negative 1046 pI am currently using OpenCV3.0 with the hope i will be able to create a program that does 3 things. First, finds faces within a live video feed. Secondly, extracts the locations of facial landmarks using ASM or AAM. Finally, uses a SVM to classify the facial expression on the persons face in the video. p  pI have done a fair amount of research into this but cant find anywhere the most suitable open source AAM or ASM library to complete this function. Also if possible I would like to be able to train the AAM or ASM to extract the specific face landmarks i require. For example, all the numbered points in the picture linked below a hrefhttpwww.imgur.comXnbCZXf relnofollowwww.imgur.comXnbCZXfap  pIf there are any alternatives to what i have suggested to get the required functionality then feel free to suggest them to me.p  pThanks in advance for any answers, all advice is welcome to help me along with this project.p

Negative 1046 pI would appreciate some ideas, discussion and feasibility of same, regarding  bulk updates on a large table in SQL Server 2008.p  pCurrently I have a table with 10,000 rows and 160 columns. This table is updated very frequently with 1 to 100 column changes per row depending on the process. Using the standard newbie table update using a codeDataAdaptercode is very slow and unsuitable.p  pThe quest is to find a faster way. I have tried finetuning the codeDataAdapter.Updatecode with batch size, regardless the more heavy updates take 1015 seconds. In the meanwhile codeSqlBulkCopycode imports the whole table in ball park 13 seconds. When the update procedure takes place 3050 times in a process the 10s15s add up p  pBeing internet self thought, I have gaps in my experience, however there are 2 possibilities that I can think of that may be better at accomplishing the task of the update.p  ol lipDump the table content from the database and repopulate the table using codeSqlBulkcopycode.pli lipUsing a stored procedure with a table passed to it with a merge SQL statement.pli ol  pThe main issue is data safety, although this is a local single user application there needs to be a way to handle errors roll back. From my understanding the dump and replace would be simpler, but perhaps more prone to data loss The stored procedure would be far more extensive to set up as the update statement would have to have all the update columns typed individually and maintained for changes. Unless there is one Update  statement .  p  pIn trying to keep this short I want to keep this at a concept level only , but will appreciate any different ideas or links and advice.p  pEDIT further info  The table has only one index, the ID column. Its a simple process of storing incoming and changing data to a simple datatable. and the update can be anywhere between 1 row to 1000 rows. The program stores the information to the database very often, and can be some or nearly all the columns. Building a stored procedure for each update would be impossible as I dont know which data will be updated, you can say that all of the columns will be updated except the ID column and a few hard data columns it depends on what the update input is. So there is no fine tuning the update to specific columns unless I list nearly all of them each time. In which case one stored procedure would do it.p  pI think the issue is the number of calls to the database are made using the current data adapter method.p  pEDIT 3 WHat about a staging table where I bulk copy the data to and then have a store procedure do the update. Wouldnt that cut down the SQL trafic I think that is the problem with the dataadapter update.p  pEdit Posted an atempt of concept 1 in an answer to this thread.p  pThank you p
Negative 1046 pThis is a repost of my question in the a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicrythmenginePCU2dKKlzy4 relnofollowGoogle Groupa. Hopefully I will get some response here.p  pFrequently I run into this problem. I want to generate a line of text if the text is not empty. If it is empty, do not generate the line. Illustration templatep  pre namespace classSpec.getNamespace  classSpec.getComment class classSpec.getName    ...  pre  pIf classSpec.getComment returns meaningful comment text, the result looks likep  pre namespace com.example   this is comment class MyClass    ...  pre  pBut if there is no comment, it will bep  pre namespace com.example   class MyClass    ...  pre  pNotice the extra empty line I do not want it. Currently the solution is to write template asp  pre namespace classSpec.getNamespace  classSpec.getCommentclass classSpec.getName    ...  pre  pand make sure the getComment will append a n to the return value. This makes the template much less readable. Also, imagine I need to generate a function with multiple parameters in a for loop. If each parameter requires complex logic of template code, I need to make them all written in one line as above. Otherwise, the result file will have function likep  pre function myFunction   String stringParam,   Integer intParam,   Long longParam  pre  pstrongThe core problem isstrong, the template file does not only contain scripts, but also raw text to be written in the output. For script part, we want newlines and indentations. We want the space to be trimmed just like what compilers usually do. But for raw text, we want the spaces to be exact as specified in the file. I feel we need a bit more raw text control mechanism to reconcile the two parts.p  pSpecific to this case, is there some special symbol to treat multiple lines as single line in the output For example, like if we can writep  pre namespace classSpec.getNamespace  classSpec.getComment class classSpec.getName    ...  pre  pThanksp

Negative 1046 pTheres a fair amount of background info.  I will get to the question near the end of this.p  pI have a MySQL replication setup with one master and two slaves.

I am copying the snapshot from the master, but it looks like it may take a week or more, because the master server is extremely busy and the rsync is not getting any disk IO bandwidth.p  pI did a partial test copy from the other slave server, and transfer rates are MUCH better ... so now I would like to try recovering from that slave instead.p  pIn preparation for this, I added a step to the snapshot script after the SHOW MASTER STATUS where it does SHOW SLAVE STATUS and records RelayMasterLogFile as file and ExecMasterLogPos as position.  I now have several snapshots on the slave server that contain this information.p  pstrongThe burning questionstrong Is the FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK command good enough to assure that the log replay information found in SHOW SLAVE STATUS is 100 coordinated with the filesystem snapshot, or would the script actually need to do STOP SLAVE before it records the slave status and makes the snapshotp  pThis is the version of mysql running on the Solaris master and slave serversp  pu01mysqlbinmysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.1.67, for sunsolaris2.10 sparc using readline 5.1p

Negative 1046 pI have a question related with the blocks execution on the SMx. Ive performed a experiment where several kernels are launched from different MPI processes in a GPU K20c. The GPU is shared for the MPI processes by CUDA MPS. According to the MPS documentation a hrefhttpsdocs.nvidia.comdeploypdfCUDAMultiProcessServiceOverview.pdf relnofollowhttpsdocs.nvidia.comdeploypdfCUDAMultiProcessServiceOverview.pdfa, a stream is associated to each MPI process, so that each MPI process can concurrently execute its kernel with other kernel belonging to other MPI process. For understanding this behaviour, Ive visualized this experiment with Visual Profiler tool. Visual Profiler show me that some kernels are being executed concurrently, but at the same time. That is to say, both kernels are absolutely overlapped between them Not only a small part of them. It seems as if the blocks belonging to both kernels are sharing the SMx at the same time. As far as I know, a SMx can only have blocks belonging to the same kernel. Do you have any idea why this is happening. Thank you so much.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThanks for your response RobertCrovella. Ive taken a look at the slides which you suggested me. According to the slides, each SMx has 4 warps schedulers and that warps can come from either different threadblocks or different concurrent kernels, Ok. I understand that when the expression different concurrent kernels is named, it refers to different kernels launched on different streams concurrently. Therefore, I think that the warps belonging to different blocks from different kernels could be scheduled by the 4 warps schedulers belonging to a SMx. However, Ive only observed this behaviour when my application is launched with CUDA MPS. When my application is only launched with streams, only a small part of the kernels the end of a kernel with the start of other kernel is overlapped. This is normal as far as I know, but the other behaviour is strange for me.p

I installed xampp on a windows machine and that sufficed to develop the app on localhost. Now, Ive been tasked to deploy the server to a private network. Which means I will have to move my code and reinstall apache, php, mysql, laravel and all the dependencies Ive used plus some extra configuration that may be needed for the project to work on the server.p  pI decided to look into Vagrant and Homestead a hrefhttplaravel.comdocs5.1homestead relnofollowfollowing the documentation tutorialsa. But Im running into some trouble configuring things.p  pBut, before we get to that, my first question is when I finally set everything up and have my server running through Vagrant, will I just be able to run it from any machine with the simple prerequisite that the target machine can run VirtualBox Will I get the server into a single file with the DB and all that I just copy to any machine and run Or will I have to install vagrant in my target machine in which case there will be way more prerequisites, virtual box, php, composer, laravel...p  hr  pAbout the specific error Im getting. To test Vagrant I installed it in an OS X machine. Ive followed the tutorial I linked until the very step you are asked to vagrant up.

I dont need to flatten the final PDF, just to fill its boxes with own text.p  pI have some experience in VBA and Java and I am wondering if it is possible to complete such a task using the above languages. p  pAs the dedicated plugin to Adobe Reader can  generate final XML file from the XFA form, maybe it is possible to write another plugin to Adobe Reader which will perform the opposite action, i.a. load the XML file to XFA structure.

Negative 1046 pIm using SWRevealController to display 3 left, center, right panels. Basically, the right panel is a tableview of numbers and the middle panel shows possible even divisions when a user clicks on a number. I connected a segue to the IBAction of a reusable tablecell in the right view controller which loads the MainViewController. This all works fine. The problem is that if the number cant be divided evenly it triggers a notification, which the main view controller observes on ViewDidLoad. This notification sets the alpha of a pseudoalert UIView at the bottom of screen to 1.0 for 4 seconds, at which point it returns to 0. Unfortunately this is where the problem starts the notification box appears for a brief second while the animation runs but when the main viewcontroller finishes animating, the alert box disappears. I have a hunch its because the ViewDidLoad fires at this point and resets the NSNotificationOberser  if I remove the segue on Touch Up Inside and manually switch view controllers the alertbox remains present.p  pCan you help me think of what Im getting wrong Like I said, I think its because the observer is initialized in the ViewDidLoad. Assuming this is the case, where should I initialize the observer so that this doesnt happen anymore p  pThanks Davis.p  pEdit Basically the main VC displays a calculator, the code for which runs in a Calculator.swift file. If, when the number is passed through Calculate, there is an error, it triggers an alert which the main VC picks up on, then reveals the box so that the user knows. Each time Calculate is called, it logs the users calculation to a tableview in the RVC  idea being they can reload previous calculations. Is this an improper usage of Notification Centerp  pThe way I want the timeline of events to bep  ol liUser clicks on cell in the right panelli liMain view controller the calculator is pushed via segueli liCalculate is called on the selected number, if there is a remainder a notification is triggeredli liThe main view displays the results from Calculate, if an alert fired then it would unhide a popup box on main view.li ol  pWhat is currently happening p  ol liUser clicks on the cell in right panel li liCalculate is called on the number, if there is a remainder the notification firesli liBefore the main view is pushed via segue, I can see briefly in the animation the result of the trigger firing and the calculationli liAs soon as the segue animation completes the view hidesli ol  pMy main VC Code PopUpView is the alert boxp  precodeclass CalculatorVC UIViewController          override func viewDidLoad          super.viewDidLoad         NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter.addObserverself, selector triggerAlert, name alert, object nil         self.PopUpView.alpha  0.0      codepre  pthe triggerAlert function p  precodefunc triggerAlertnotification NSNotification       PopUpView.alpha  1.0           let returnedRemainder  notification.userInfo     let sample Double  returnedRemainder[userTotal]as Double     self.label.text  Warning Remainder Doubleround100  sample100   codepre  pthe tableView didSelect of the right VC p  precode    func tableViewtableView UITableView, didSelectRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath   newUser.calculate codepre  pcode here assigns the value in the selected table cell to newUserp  pThen in the Calculate function p  precodedispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,                  NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter.postNotificationNamealert, object nil, userInfo userTotalDictionary                  codepre

Negative 1046 pIm looking for some best practices when it comes to modeling confidential hierarchical data in general and specifically with DynamoDB. p  pThe scenario is best explained with an example  Lets say we have a number of codeuserscode. Each codeusercode has a number of codeproductscode. Each codeproductcode consists of a number of codepartscode.p  pTypical use cases p  ul liList all codeproductscode for a given codeusercodeli liList all codepartscode for a given codeproductcodeli ul  pSo far I have modeled this in DynamoDB like thisp  precodeUsers  HashKey  UserId   Products  HashKey  UserId RangeKey ProductId   Parts  HashKey  ProductId RangeKey PartId codepre  pThe data is confidential and accessed through authenticated REST endpoints where an authentication token can be mapped to a codeUserIdcode. Each user emmayem be allowed to view other users data through some group concept.p  pListing all products for a given user is simple since codeUserIdcode is a key in the products tablep  pcodeGET users111productscode becomes a simple codeQueryTableProducts, UserId111codep  pBut consider the case of listing all parts for a given productp  pcodeGET users111products222partscodep  pIf I simply do a codeQueryTableParts, ProductId222code then I will get the desired data fast, but I am not protecting against other users querying for data belonging to user 111, provided they somehow know about codeProductIdcode 222 in reality, IDs will of course be UUIDs or similar so not so easily guessablep  pcodeGET users119products222partscodep  p... would result in malicious user 119 retrieving data that doesnt belong to him, provided nothing is done to address this. So here I imagine I need to do something like one of these p  ol liFirst make another query to make sure product 222 in fact belongs to the given userli liDuplicate the codeUserIdcode in the Parts table and include it in the query condition which basically means it will match either emallem rows or emnoem rows when scanning through the set identified by codeProductIdcode codeQueryTableParts, ProductId222, UserId111codeli liUse UserId as the hash key also in the Parts table and instead keep ProductId as a secondary indexli liUse a composite HashKey such as codeUserIdProductIdcode 111222 on the codePartscode tableli ol  pIf I need to return a 401 as opposed to just empty data, option 1 seems like the only approach. But if we imagine a deeper hierarchy of data, e.g. users having inboxes having messages having parts having attachments it seems this approach could eventually be expensive listing all attachments for part P might result in a query to check that part P belongs to message M, that message M belongs to inbox I and that inbox I belongs to user U, and so on.p  pDoes anyone have any good arguments for which approach is most favorable Or am I doing something stupid and should be modeling my data in some other way completelyp

Negative 1046 pI have either an Excel question or a database question.  The reason why it might be either is because, even if the data is entered into an Excel or cvs, it will be imported into a database.  p  pTherefore, it may be more efficient to directly create the records in the database.p  pA quick overview of the use case.  Our company has picked up 1200 store locations.  We are installing equipment in monthly waves of 100.  p  pOnce we install a store, they pay a Install Fee.  p  pAlso, once we install a store, they will begin paying a license fee for that month, and every month thereafter.p  pEach store is going to be assigned a Store ID, and every Install Fee and every License payment the store makes will be recorded, as well as the date.p  pTherefore, for the year, we should have 1200 Store IDs.p  pEach Store ID will have one Install Fee record, so there will be 1200 Install Fee records total.p  pFor License Payments, there will be 100 stores who will make 12 License payments the 100 installed in January, 100 stores will make 11 License payments the 100 installed in February, etc. It comes out to 7800 License Payment records.p  pSo, in total with the Install Payments, there are 9000 records.p  pstrongStore ID scriptstrong I would like to create a script to create Store IDs automatically, according to the following format  The first letter of the ID is J and then a fourdigit number, starting with 0001 and working up.  So the first Store ID would be J0001, the second J0002, etc.p  pstrongInstall Payments Scriptstrong The second script Id like to write is to add the 1200 Install Payments records automatically, one Install Payment for each Store ID.p  pstrongLicense Payments Scriptstrong The third script is for creating License Payment records for each License Payment. For all Store IDs J0001 to J0100, there would be 12 License Payment records for each Store ID because they were installed in January.  For all Store IDs J0101 to J0200, there would be 11 License Payment records for each store ID, because they were installed in February.p  pThe finished table or Excel columns would look like thisp  ptableExcel sheet columnsp  precodeStore ID       Description      Date          Amount J0001          Install         013115      1000.00 J0001          License         013115       250.00 J0002          Install         013115      1000.00 codepre
