Positive 4928 pI have an application where I need to sum across arbitrary groups of indices in a 3D NumPy array. The builtin NumPy array sum routine sums up all indices along one of the dimensions of an ndarray. Instead, I need to sum up ranges of indices along one of the dimensions in my array and return a new array.p  pFor example, lets assume that I have an ndarray with shape code70,25,3code. I wish to sum up the first dimension along certain index ranges and return a new 3D array. Consider the sum from code025, 2550code and code5075code which would return an array of shape code3,25,3code. p  pIs there an easy way to do disjoint sums along one dimension of a NumPy array to produce this resultp

Negative 4928 pGreetings,p  pI need to include a property in my class which is a collection of System.IO.FileInfo objects.

Negative 4928 pI am working on a 2D scrolling game for iPhone. I have a large image background, say 4806000 pixels, of only a part is visible exactly one screens worth, 480320 pixels. What is the best way to get such a background on the screenp  pCurrently I have the background split into several textures to get around the maximum texture size limit and draw the whole background in each frame as a textured triangle strip. The scrolling is done by translating the modelview matrix. The scissor box is set to the window size, 480320 pixels. This is not meant to be fast, I just wanted a working code before I get to optimizing.p  pI thought that maybe the OpenGL implementation would be smart enough to discard the invisible portion of the background, but according to some measuring code I wrote it looks like background takes 7ms to draw on average and 84ms at maximum. This is measured in the simulator. This is about a half of the whole render loop, ie. quite slow for me. p  pDrawing the background should be as easy as copying some 480320 pixels from one part of the VRAM to another, or, in other words, blazing fast. What is the best way to get closer to such performancep

Negative 4928 pI am desiging a RESTful Web Service JBoss  RESTeasy.  The UI programmer is writing an Ajax web app that will use it.  The web app will be one HTML page with everything done in JavaScript.  For security, all traffic goes through SSL.p  pCurrently Im using Basic authentication.  The UI programmer can show a dialog to get a username and password and put Authorization Basic xxxxx in the header.  Unfortunately if the password is wrong, the ugly browser login dialog box comes up.  Also there is no way for the user to log off.  This is unacceptable.p  pThere appears to be no way to intercept a 401 response to an XMLHttpRequest in any of the browsers we will use.p  pFormbased authentication wont work for us.  We need an automatic logoff after some period of inactivity the equivalent of a session timeout.  We cant have the server suddenly return a login page when the client expects a JSON object.p  pJBoss offers four authentication strategies  BASIC, FORM, CLIENTCERT and DIGEST.  I think DIGEST has the same problem as BASIC.  None of the four is what we want.p  pThis web application will be the only client for now so there is no requirement to use BASIC.  Is there any other authentication strategy I can install  For instance is there an implementation of WSSE UsernameToken I can use  As described in Chapter 8 of the OReilly RESTful Web Services book.  The server would send WSSE instead of Basic in the WWWAuthenticate header and presumably the browser would ignore it and pass it right through.p  pI want to configure security where it belongs  in the JBoss configuration files, not in my RESTful Web Service  so Im looking for an implementation I can just plug into JBoss.p

Negative 4928 pIm relatively new to JS and Im having issues properly emulating OOP principles. p  pI guess I have two questions. Question the first is regarding the many ways to declare variables.p  pSay I have a classp  precodefunction clazza      this.b  2     var c  3     this.prototype.d  4  or clazz.prototype.d  4   var myClazz  new clazz1 codepre  pAm I correct in the following assessmentsp  pa is a private variable that is instance specific i.e. different instances of clazz will have unique and independent variables a. It can be accessed from within clazz as a.p  pb is a public variable that is instance specific. It can be accessed from within clazz as this.b and from outside clazz as myClazz.b.p  pc is a private variable that is static, or class specific i.e. different instances of clazz will share the same c variable. It can be accessed from within any instance of clazz as c and changes in instance of clazz are reflected in all instances of clazz.p  pd is a public variable that is staticclass specific. It can be accessed from anywhere via clazz.prototype.d or myClazz.prototype.d.p  pThe overall issue I have with my understanding of the variable scheme is that theres no way to declare a private variable that is NOT static i.e. a unique version for every instance of the class.p  pThe second question is with respect to different types of class declarations.p  pIve been usingp  precodevar MySingleton  new function ... codepre  pto create singletons. Is this correct Im also unsure as to the effect of the new keyword in this situation as well as appending  function braces to the end of the declaration as sop  precodevar MySingleton  new function ... codepre  pIve been using this pattern to declare a class and then instantiate instances of that classp  precodefunction myClass ... var classA  new myClass var classB  new myClass codepre  pIs this the proper methodp

I thought Id include everything that might be relevant as I dont have much clue what is wrong.p  pI had a working web service and client both written with VS 2008 in C for passing product data to an ecommerce site. The XSD started like thisp  precodeltxsschema idEcommerce     elementFormDefaultqualified     xmlnsmstnshttptempuri.orgEcommerce.xsd     xmlnsxshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemagt  ltxselement nameeurgt   ltxscomplexTypegt    ltxssequencegt     ltxselement refsec minOccurs1 maxOccurs1gt    ltxssequencegt codepre  petcp  pHeres a sample document sent from client to servicep  precodelteur xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance classECommerceWebService typeproduct methodGetLastDateSent chunkno1 totalchunks1 datestamp20100310T171634.523 version1.1gt   ltsec guidBFBACB3C4C174786ACCF96BFDBF32DA5 companynameCompany version1.1gt     ltdata gt   ltsecgt lteurgt codepre  pThen, I had to give the service a targetNamespace. Actually I dont know if I had to set it, but I added to the same VS project some code to act as a client to a completely unrelated service which also had no namespace, and the project would not build until I gave my service a namespace.p  pNow the XSD starts like thisp  precodeltxsschema idEcommerce     elementFormDefaultqualified     xmlnsmstnshttptempuri.orgEcommerce.xsd     xmlnsxshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema     targetNamespacehttpwww.company.comecommerce     xmlnsecomhttpwww. company.comecommercegt  ltxselement nameeurgt   ltxscomplexTypegt    ltxssequencegt     ltxselement refecomsec minOccurs1 maxOccurs1 gt    ltxssequencegt codepre  petcp  pAs you can see above I also updated all the xselement ref attributes to give them the ecom prefix. Now the project builds again. p  pI found the client needed some modification after this. The client uses a SQL stored procedure to generate the XML. This is then deserialised into an object of the correct type for the services getdata method. The objects type used to be eur but after updating the web reference to the service, it became getdataEur.

Negative 4928 pIm synchronizing reader and writer processes on Linux.p  pI have 0 or more process the readers that need to sleep until they are woken up, read a resource, go back to sleep and so on. Please note I dont know how many reader processes are up at any moment. I have one process the writer that writes on a resource, wakes up the readers and does its business until another resource is ready in detail, I developed a no starve readerwriters solution, but thats not important.p  pTo implement the sleep  wake up mechanism I use a Posix condition value, pthreadcondt. The clients call a pthreadcondwait on the variable to sleep, while the server does a pthreadcondbroadcast to wake them all up. As the manual says, I surround these two calls with a lockunlock of the associated pthread mutex.p  pThe condition variable and the mutex are initialized in the server and shared between processes through a shared memory area because Im not working with threads, but with separate processes an Im sure my kernel  syscall support it because I checked POSIXTHREADPROCESSSHARED.p  pWhat happens is that the first client process sleeps and wakes up perfectly. When I start the second process, it blocks on its pthreadcondwait and emneverem wakes up, even if Im sure by the logs that pthreadcondbroadcast is called.p  pIf I kill the first process, and launch another one, it works perfectly. In other words, the condition variable pthreadcondbroadcast seems to wake up only one process a time. If more than one process wait on the very same shared condition variable, only the first one manages to wake up correctly, while the others just seem to ignore the broadcast.p  pWhy this behaviour If I send a pthreadcondbroadcast, emeveryem waiting process should wake up, not just one and, however, not always the same one.p

I have not found any authoritative references that HTTP pipelining is something more than a theoretical model and is properly implemented by HTTP servers. Additionally all browsers that support pipelining have this feature off by default.p  pSo, should I try to implement such a client or I will be in a lot of trouble due to servers implementations or proxies.  Is there any reference that gives guidelines on thesep  pIf it is a bad idea what would be the alternative programming model for efficiency Separate TCP connectionsp

While many of the answers present interesting ideas, I havent been able to find one that answers this question directly.p  pSo to illustrate my dilemma, say I have a Java class that implements the javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.Tag interface...p  precodeimport javax.servlet.ServletRequest import javax.servlet.jsp.JspException import javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.Tag  class MyTag implements Tag      private PageContext pageContext      public void setPageContextPageContext pageContext          pageContext  pageContext          .     .     . codepre  pThis gives me access to a PageContext object, which provides some useful information about the calling JSP.  Problem is, PageContext doesnt seem to provide access to many of the JSPs emactualem implicit objects...p  precode. . . public int doEndTag throws JspException      ServletRequest req  pageContext.getRequest     .     .     .     return EVALPAGE  codepre  pThe ServletRequest object depicted above is quite different from HttpServletRequest, which is implemented by the implicit object request in the JSP itself.  This makes calling such handy methods as HttpServletRequest.getRequestURI problematic inside my class.p  pSo from reading the answers to several other questions here, Im left with the impression that there is no outofthebox way of getting at the actual implicit objects.  I either have to pass them explicitly as attributes of the custom tag in my JSP...p  precodeltmcmytag requestltrequestgtgt codepre  p...or perhaps store them in the hash of some other implicit object I emdoem have access to...p  precodelt session.setAttributerequest, request gt codepre  pWhich, if true, naturally leads me to the question... emare you friggin kidding meem  Theres got to be something key that Im missing here.  Access to the JSPs implicit objects seems like such a reasonably common thing for me to want in my custom taglib classes.  It strikes me as immensely kludgy to have to take such steps every time I require them  especially when Im being passed something like the PageContext object that could conceivably provide them for me, but doesnt seem to.p  pI really feel like Im missing something basic here, but I cant for the life of me figure out what that might be.  Can someone shed some light on thisp

Negative 4928 pI want to create a simple long polling server in node.js where communication will be based on jsonp requests. I understand that client makes request and server holds response until some data are ready or certain timeout is reached, and then new request from client is made to keep the things going. Once the first request is made, session ID is generated and stored to keep the list of actively connected clients. Now how do I identify that any other request, after the first response from server to client, belongs to which client in my list of active connectionsp  pI can imagine to do it like this first response from server send assigned session ID to client, and then he is identified based on this ID when making next requests. But I think this approach can be easily exploited and vulnerable to identity theft.p

Each vector stores its digits in reverse order, for easier representation by powers of ten. For example, 3497  3  103  4  102  9  101  7 100 and is stored in a vector as 7, 9, 4, 3. Thus, each index of the vector represents that digits respective power of ten in the integer.p  pHowever, Im having some bugs in my multiplication. 1digit x 1digit and 2digit x 1digit multiplication work perfectly, but it breaks down at 2digit x 2digit. Im fairly certain that fixing this bug would fix all the other bugs with ndigit x mdigit. My code for both my multiplication and addition methods are below.p  precodevectorltintgt multiplyvectorltintgt ampa, vectorltintgt ampb       check for emptiness     ifa.size  0         return b     else ifb.size  0         return a      unsigned int i  increment counter       compensate for size differences     ifa.size gt b.size         fori  0 i lt a.sizeb.size i             b.pushback0     else         fori  0 i lt b.sizea.size i             a.pushback0      int c  0  carry value     int temp  temporary integer     vectorltintgt p  product vector     vectorltintgt s  sum vector     s.pushback0  initialize to 0       multiply each digit of a by an index of b     fori  0 i lt b.size i           skip digits of 0         ifb[i]  0             continue          p.resizei,0  resize p and add 0s           multiply b[i] by each digit of a         forunsigned int j  0 j lt a.size j              temp  c  b[i]  a[j]  calculate temporary value               two cases             iftemp gt 9                  c  temp  10  new carry                 p.pushbacktemp  10                          else                  c  0                 p.pushbacktemp                                 append carry if relevant         ifc  0             p.pushbackc           sum p and s         s  addp, s         p.clear  empty p           return s  return summed vector total product   vectorltintgt addvectorltintgt ampa, vectorltintgt ampb       check for emptiness     ifa.size  0         return b     else ifb.size  0         return a      unsigned int i  increment counter       compensate size differences     ifa.size gt b.size         fori  0 i lt a.sizeb.size i             b.pushback0     else         fori  0 i lt b.sizea.size i             a.pushback0      int c  0  carry value     vectorltintgt s  sum vector     int temp  temporary value       iterate through decimal vectors     fori  0 i lt a.size i          temp  c  a[i]  b[i]  sum three terms           two cases         iftemp gt 9              c  temp  10  new carry             s.pushbacktemp  10  push back remainder                  else              c  0             s.pushbacktemp                     append carry if relevant     ifc  0         s.pushbackc      return s  return sum  codepre  pA few test casesp  p45  16 returns 740 should be 720 34  18 returns 542 should be 532 67  29 returns 2003 should be 1943 28  12 returns 336 correctp  pThe only problem I could think of would be an issue with the carries, but everything seems to check out as I walk through the code.

Negative 4928 pbr Im building a web app and would like to use an ORM to map the data from db with objects.br I have been struggling with this for a few days, and tried various implementations, including emCodeigniter ORM, Kohana ORM, PHP.ActiveRecords and Doctrineem.br The last two I cant really use, because they depend on PHP 5.3 which is not installed and can not be on my shared hosting server.p  pThe problem with all these ORMs is inheritance except for Doctrine, but I can use it.br I know a lot of developers just do dbs without inheritance, but here is my problemp  pMy db needs to be multilingual, I designed my db by the following examplebr Table codeProduct gt id, categoryid, price...code everything that is not translatablebr Table codeProductTranslationgt id, languageid, name, description...code same id as product, adds language FK, and fields that are translatablep  pMaybe there is a better approach, but I really like this, because its very flexible can add new languages and does not put a lot of emNULLsem in the db, also joining is not that costly because the tables are relatively small unlike the approach to put all translations in a single table, and reference that table from all other tables. p  pThe only workaround, I found,  to support ORMs is to put a codehasonecode relation betweenbr codeProductgtProductTranslationcode.  p  pThis way I could access the translated fields with something likebr codeDBgetproductbyid4gttranslationgtnamecodep  pNevermind the syntax, but the real problem with this approach is that I have to define new objectsmodels for translation tables, and logically they dont belong there.

Negative 4928 pI have a Lighttpd1.4.28 web server running on Centos 5.3 and PHP 5.3.6 in fastcgi mode.p  pThe server itself is a quad core with 1gb ram and is used to record viewing statistics for a video platform.p  pEach request consists of a very small bit of xml being posted and the receiving php script performs a simple INSERT or UPDATE mysql query. The php returns a very small response to acknowledge the request.p  pThese requests are performed very frequently and i need the system to be able to handle as many concurrent connections as possible at a high rate of requestssecond.p  pI have disabled keep alive as only single requests will be made and so I dont need to keep connections open. p  pOne of the things that concern me is that in serverstatus I am seeing a lot of connections in the read state. I take it this is controlled by server.maxreadidle which is set to 60 by default Is it ok to change this to something like 5 as I am seeing the majority of connections being kept open for long periods of time.p  pAlso what else can I do to optimise lighttpd to be able to server lots of small requestsp  pThis is my first experience setting up lighttpd as I thought it would be more suitable than apache in this case.p  pThanksp  pIrfanp

Negative 4928 pI have question regarding changing orientation on iPad.p  pI use MonoTouch, but if ObjC programmers can help, it will be just as great.p  pFirst of all, I figured out if I provide different splash screen images for different orientations, app will show the right one. This can be done for any orientation, such as DefaultLandscapeLeft.png, or generic one DefaultLandscape.png.p  pAll of my images are of correct dimensions and yet, when I start it in portrait mode, it shows it enlarged. All of other modes work perfectly well.p  pSecond problem is I want my app to continue to be in that orientation after my first controller appear. At the moment, it shows portrait in any case. I started generating orientation notifications before first controller appeared UINavigationController, but I think it responds only on orientation changes. After I moved device, it rotates and from that moment, everything works fine. BUT, I want to inherit orientation info from my splash screen.p  pAny idea will be appreciated.p  pThanks guys and girls.p  pCheersp

I am experiencing very inconsistent measurements between separate runs. The method has an extremely high standard deviation when compared to other methods see Explanation below.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Is there a reason why codeclockgettimecode would give so inconsistent measurements when compared to other methods Is there an alternative method with the same resolution that accounts for thread idle timep  pstrongExplanationstrong I am trying to profile a number of small parts of C code. The execution time of each of the code segments is not more than a couple of microseconds. In a single run, each of the code segments will execute some hundreds of times, which produces coderuns  hundredscode of measurements.p  pI also have to measure only the time the thread actually spends executing which is why coderdtsccode is not suitable. I also need a high resolution which is why codetimescode is not suitable.p  pIve tried the following methodsp  ul lipcoderdtsccode on Linux and Windows,pli lipcodeclockgettimecode with CLOCKTHREADCPUTIMEID on Linux, andpli lipcodeQueryThreadCycleTimecode on Windows.pli ul  pstrongMethodologystrong The analysis was performed on 25 runs. In each run, separate code segments repeat a 101 of times. Therefore I have 2525 measurements. Then I look at a histogram of the measurements, and also calculate some basic stuff like the mean, std.dev., median, mode, min, and max.p  pI do not present how I measured the similarity of the three methods, but this simply involved a basic comparison of proportion of times spent in each code segment proportion means that the times are normalised. I then look at the pure differences in these proportions. This comparison showed that all rdtsc, QTCT, and CGT measure the same proportions when averaged over the 25 runs. However, the results below show that CGT has a very large standard deviation. This makes it unusable in my use case.p  pstrongResultsstrongp  pA comparison of codeclockgettimecode with coderdtsccode for the same code segment 25 runs of 101 measurements  2525 readingsp  ul lipstrongclockgettimestrongp  ul li1881 measurements of 11 ns,li li595 measurements were distributed almost normally between 3369 and 3414 ns,li li2 measurements of 11680 ns,li li1 measurement of 1506022 ns, andli lipthe rest is between 900 and 5000 ns.pli lipMin 11 nspli liMax 1506022 nsli liMean 1471.862 nsli liMedian 11 nsli liMode 11 nsli liStddev 29991.034li ulli lipstrongrdtscstrong note no context switches occurred during this run, but if it happens, it usually results in just a single measurement of 30000 ticks or sop  ul li1178 measurements between 274 and 325 ticks,li li306 measurements between 326 and 375 ticks,li li910 measurements between 376 and 425 ticks,li li129 measurements between 426 and 990 ticks,li li1 measurement of 1240 ticks, andli lip1 measurement of 1256 ticks.pli lipMin 274 tickspli liMax 1256 ticksli liMean 355.806 ticksli liMedian 333 ticksli liMode 376 ticksli liStddev 83.896li ulli ul  pstrongDiscussionstrongp  ul lipcoderdtsccode gives very similar results on both Linux and Windows. It has an acceptable standard deviationit is actually quite consistentstable. However, it does not account for thread idle time. Therefore, context switches make the measurements erratic on Windows I have observed this quite often a code segment with an average of 1000 ticks or so will take 30000 ticks every now and thendefinitely because of preemption.pli lipcodeQueryThreadCycleTimecode gives very consistent measurementsi.e. much lower standard deviation when compared to coderdtsccode. When no context switches happen, this method is almost identical to coderdtsccode.pli lipcodeclockgettimecode, on the other hand, is producing extremely inconsistent results not just between runs, but also between measurements. The standard deviations are extreme when compared to coderdtsccode.pli ul  pI hope the statistics are okay. But what could be the reason for such a discrepancy in the measurements between the two methods Of course, there is caching, CPUcore migration, and other things. But none of this should be responsible for any such differences between rdtsc and clockgettime. What is going onp  hr  h2Further Investigationh2  pI have investigated this a bit further.

Negative 4928 pI have find a lot of posts similar to this question but I dont think Im doing it wrong since Im not putting javascript in the response of the ajax call.p  pBasically the ajax returns pure html that is put inside a div. This div is inside my page and the page already contains references to css and javascript files.p  pIn one of those javascript files I try to render the buttons returned by the ajax call to look nice with a jquery ui function so basically what I do is thisp  precode.ButtonClass.button codepre  pThis piece of code is in the document.ready function, and the html returned by ajax includes the ButtonClass for all the buttons.p  pThe code.buttoncode works for a button outside the returned ajax html, but it does not work for elements returned by the ajax call. p  pI think it should work because css styles are applied to the results but I cannot get any function to work with the results, i repeat I dont return javascript code I have this code in an external file which is referenced in the whole page.p
Negative 4928 pIm making use of a bunch of InputFormTextBoxes and Id like to have an onblur event get fired when the box is no longer in focus. This is when RichText  true. p  pThis is because I have a Sharepoint Webpart that has a lot of editable areas and richtext is required. However, the screen gets cluttered if they are all available. So Im making it autosave and hide the text box when the user clicks away. This saves screen real estate, and improves the page performance greatly.p  pI can get this to work with RichText  false, so its just a normal TextArea HTML control. However, I cant set focus with JavaScript on the textarea, and I cant get an event to fire for the onblur event.p

Negative 4928 pI am creating a class that acts as a container which holds a label and buttons.  I want the buttons to only appear when I mouseover the label on a new layer, and be clickable, but this is not my question I have discovered OyverLay Layout and JLayeredPane for this purpose, and I will figure that out later.  Like I said I plan to use JLayeredPane vs regular JPanel because of its multi layer abilities most likely, but my first question is this the correct type of container to use if this class will instantiate objects onto another classes JFrame container  I dont think it is because as a panel it creates a window with a title bar and buttons, and I dont want that.  I just want this class to instantiate a box with my label and buttons and add it to a JFrame to be in a grid with other buttonsp  pMy main issue is, I want this container that holds the label and buttons to be added to a JFrame that is apart of a class whos main job is to hold the containers from my first class and have the user be able to add more and remove via a UI.p  pEssentially I want a form with text boxes and a button, and the button adds a new ListItem object to the JFrame of another class and the new objects label text is built form the text boxes, instantiating a new object on that JFrame.  So, if I hit the button 5 times Ill see 5 boxes with 5 labels in them with unique words one right on top of the other.p  pI have looked into using the root container, using JInternalFrames, and tried every other magic tricks but cant seem to get it to work right.p  pHere is the code for the class I have built.p  pstrongemabove this in my class is the importing of the objects I need, and the creation of various strings, buttons and labels used here.  what I have pasted here is the meat of my code, the object which is created and displayed when instanciatedemstrongp  precodepublic ListItemString nameC, String timeC, String recordNum      JLayeredPane panel1  new JLayeredPane     name  nameC time  timeC recordN  recordNum             fullItemString is a String object     fullItemString  Help   name   at   time   regarding   Record    recordNum             item is a label     item.setTextfullItemString     item.setFontverdana      minusButton.putClientPropertyJButton.buttonType, square     exportButton.putClientPropertyJButton.buttonType, square     editButton.putClientPropertyJButton.buttonType, square       setSize425, 50     setDefaultCloseOperationEXITONCLOSE      minusButton.setBounds175, 1, 35, 30     editButton.setBounds210, 1, 35, 30     exportButton.setBounds130, 1, 35, 30      panel1.addminusButton, new Integer2     panel1.addtop, new Integer1     panel1.addeditButton, new Integer3     panel1.addexportButton, new Integer4      minusButton.addActionListenerthis     item.addMouseListenerthis      exportButton.setVisiblefalse     minusButton.setVisiblefalse     editButton.setVisiblefalse      lp.setVisibletrue     setVisibletrue  codepre

Negative 4928 pI understand WHY the System.Data.SQLite.dll is provided in 32 bit and 64 bit builds. So lets not dwell on that and move on. p  pSince it is done this way it seems to make pure C development a tad more difficult with 3 choices to make. p  ol lipIs to support only 32bit and force there managed assembly to compile x86 and deal with that in running in 32 or 64 bit, and there by lose advantages of when you are on a 64 bit environment. pli lipIs to force 64 bit and only support 64 bit and losing the ability to run on 32 bit but gaining all the advantages of 64 bit. pli lipIs to create two versions of their assembly one that compiles x86 and uses 32 bit SQLite and another that compiles x64 and uses 64bit SQLite. It prevents using ANY as a compile option and being able to easily deploy a single build to either type.  Its not so horrible to manage from a development point of view as we will need two projects. Only having  the C code officially in one, and the other will just use links to the code in the other. This is for compiling purposes only. Still leaves us with having to manage two outputs to  for deployments.pli ol  pWith all that said I am only looking for confirmation that the above are the only correct choices. p  pIf however there are other choices that I am overlooking please let me know. Specifically if there is way to get a single C DLL that can compile to ANY so it can take advantage of 32 or 64 bit depending on where its run and still use System.Data.SQLite.dll.p

Do they get invoked from the OnLoad method in the system.web.ui.page If so then I have the opinion this was causing an infinite loop and eventually running out of memory and crashing the apppool.p  pCould this be the cause of our troubles I appreciate any input.p

Negative 4928 pIs it possible to schedule a custom action after a reboot  Heres my predicament.p  pI have a product to uninstall and reinstall but some of the files are in use by another application at the time of reinstall.  This causes problems for the uninstall because the files are in use so I use a custom action which runs a batch file to rename the files in use.  This is a bit of a hack but makes the uninstall and reinstall not complain about the files being in use and replaces the files I want.  p  pThe reason for doing this is that Im not allowed to force a reboot on the machine during the installation process but I need to make sure that the files get replaced.  So far so good.p  pThis has the side effect of a bunch of files hanging around that Ive renamed with a prefix toDeletefileX.dll along with the new fileX.dll in the folder.  p  pI have another custom action to delete these files which works fine but I cant run it at the end of the installation because the other application still has a handle to these renamed toDelete prefixed files.  p  pAt some point in the future the system will be rebooted and this is where I would like the custom action to run to delete the toDelete prefixed files.p  pThanks.

Negative 4928 pI want to use C2DM in my android application. I am using code schemas shown in official tutorials.  Everything seems to work fine, but I have problem with handling registration properly. There are 2 methods in C2DMMessaging class which I have to use firstly register and next getRegistrationID. If I use them sequentially, I get null form the getRegistrationID. The problem is registration is asynchronous. In my application in the beginning I need to know the regidtrationId, I can start the rest of the app only after I get it. I tried to do some synchronization using monitors i.e. wait in register method and notify in C2DMReceiver.onRegistered, but it didnt work the code of onRegistered hasnt been reached, after calling wait in register. In other words what I need is making registration synchronous, so I could continue, only after I get registrationId. What is the right way to do itp

Negative 4928 pIm trying to use Dapper to interface with the ASP.NET SQL Membership Provider tables.  I wrapped the SqlMembershipProvider class and added an additional method to get me the MembershipUsers given a certain criteria relating to some custom tables I have.p  pWhen querying the data with Dapper, it appears that Dapper first instantiates the class with a parameterless constructor, and then maps the returned columns into the properties on the object.p  pHowever, the UserName property on the MembershipUser class has a no setter.  Judging from around line 1417 in the Dapper SqlMapper.cs, the method codeGetSettablePropscode only gets settable properties. p  pI tried to do a MultiMap query to invoke the constructor, but the problem with that is the objects passed into the query are already missing the UserName.p  pIm guessing I could modify the codeGetSettablePropscode method, but Im not sure if that will work, or if it will affect my existing code.p  pstrongIs there anyway for me to invoke the custom constructor that the MembershipUser class hasstrong p  pstrongOr is there a reasonable change that I could make to Dapper to support my situationstrongp  p strongUPDATEstrong p  pMarcs answer to use the nongenericdynamic Query method was correct, but for posterity, this is the method I was referring to inside Dapperp  precodestatic ListltPropInfogt GetSettablePropsType t      return t           .GetPropertiesBindingFlags.Public  BindingFlags.NonPublic  BindingFlags.Instance           .Selectp gt new PropInfo                          Name  p.Name,               Setter  p.DeclaringType  t  p.GetSetMethodtrue  p.DeclaringType.GetPropertyp.Name.GetSetMethodtrue,               Type  p.PropertyType                      .Whereinfo gt info.Setter  null           .ToList    codepre

Negative 4928 pSo, Im building an application which save locations to a database using latlon coordinates. Users can the fetch these records using either creation date recent or position nearby. My goal now is to implement caching to speed up the app.p  pFor the recent section, Im guessing that its pretty simple, just cache the query for a minute or so, but for the location based queries, this would make no sense. Im currently getting the users location from the map, and the fetching the 25 closest locations from the DB. As the user can move the map freely iOS, the chance of hitting the exact same spot twice is non existing, which makes me believe that Im using the wrong approach here.p  pHow would I arrange my data, and queries, so that users can still get results based on their location, but still take advantage of some caching.

Negative 4928 pMozilla claims someone can sit at your computer and get your passwords for each site in 15 seconds.  I learned while writing a Firefox extension for the first time that I could access any file in a users directory given that it was owned by the user.

Negative 4928 pThis is a design, since ive not done anything similar in the past, and is a good challange. I have a server which supports Oracle, Sql Server and Mongodb. You can select which one to use at startup. Essentially each server stores xml packets, which are split down into their component elements.  p  pI need to build a reporting database which provides aggration and summary data for reports for the dashboard, but the problem opportunity is Mongodb. I could easily use sql server reporting services to build the reportdb, same with Oracle, or I could something like Crystal which works against both, or even create a db, and set a bundle of triggers on each table, with some plsql logic with Oracle, or TSql with Sql to create the reporting db on the fly. And that would take care of report. But their is mongodb. Little or no reporting infrastructure, certainly not outside BIRT, or jaspersoft Java. Im using C.p  pI was thinking of having c server component, which intercepts incoming xml packets, and extracts the appropriate element field data, and writes it into a reporting db, perhaps something like sqlite which may be too small. If it was running on sql server, or Oracle then I would use that db instance to support the reporting db. p  pOn any database, im really only supporting upto 6 months data. The data will be classified as 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, with a progressive archive onto on compression and backup db. p  pBut this is where it gets hazy. For instance, using sqlite as the reporting db, and mongodb as the xml databse. Taking an example. If a user wants to drill down, would I have to provide some kind of dynamic update that would pull the additional reporting info from Mongodb, or could all be done at the server component stage, when its been writen in to sqlite. p  pOr is all f bol.cksp  pAny ideas or thoughts greatly appreciated.

Those folders should even have their own icon.p  pIve been able to achieve this by providing the folder with an extension and setting up the document type part of the applications codeInfo.plistcode file.p  pUnfortunately, I dont want to add an extension to the folder, I want to associate regular folders with my application. To be precise I want to associate every folder which contains a subfolder called Subfolder for example.p  pIs there a way to achieve thisp
Negative 4928 pI am using wsdualhttpbinding to connect the client and WCF Service. My client likes to invoke a long running request and wanted a periodic status update, hence I have choosen callbackcontracts. that worked fine. However It publishes for all clients who have just been loaded and has not requested that operation.p  pIs it possible to direct the callbacks to the requestor alone, though all clients are loaded.p
Negative 4928 pIm working in Django and have installed djangocelery. The celery daemon is running on my local server and acceptingexecuting tasks.p  pThe last piece for me is to create a task that sends a message to an AMPQ broker on another server. The broker configuration is in my settings.py file, but Im not clear on how to make the connection to the AMPQ server and construct the message with header and jsonencoded payload.p  pAnd now Ive come to wonder whether I even need to be running celery just to send a message to an external AMQP broker. p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIm using Kombu to publish to the AMQP broker, and it appears I can successfully establish the Publisher connection using the correct exchange, routingkey and exchangetype.  My message must consist of a header with three keyvalue pairs and a jsonencoded payload. Im unclear how to construct the message.p
Negative 4928 pOne can iterate over a list without using pointers or references. In some cases this removes the need for actually having the list. Consider the following code,p  precodeint i for i  0 i lt 10 i  printfi , i  2 codepre  pIt directly outputs the list 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 without actually storing the list in memory.p  pHow can one do a similar thing with binary treesp  pPlease show a way to implement treeiterator, newroottreeiterator and, traversetreeiterator for the following code where upperboundaryoftree is something analogous to the number 10 in the list example and that I dont know how to define.p  pPeople have been having trouble with what I mean by upperboundaryoftree. The upper boundary of the tree would not be represented by the number 10. I dont know how to represent some upper boundary of a tree. This is part of the question. The upper boundary of the tree is similar to how the number 10 is used in the list code above, as in it does the same function, marking where to stop iterating but, it is very definitely not the same thing.p  pIf you need to you can have a freetreeiterator function as well.p  precodetreeiterator i  newroottreeiterator while traversetreeiteratorampi, upperboundaryoftree  foobari codepre  pThis has been bothering me for a while.p

Negative 4928 pFrom the Wikipedia entry on a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRecursivedefinition relnofollowrecursive definitionap  blockquote   pAn inductive definition of a set describes the elements in a set in terms of other elements in the set.

Negative 4928 pJust to give you some context, heres what Im trying to achieve I am embedding a const char in a shared object file in order to have a version string in the .so file itself.

At this address its there, zero terminated and as expected. I am using this method for now.p  pI am not a computer scientist.

Negative 4928 pIve been using GetFileInformationByHandleEx routine in a VS2005 project. At that time the function was available with FileExtd.h and FileExtd.lib which you had to manually download it. Now I want to migrate the project to VS2010 and Ive seen that there is a FileExtd.lib that is shipped with the new SDK.p  pIn VS2010 the GetFileInformationByHandleEx is declared in winbase.h, but in order to keep compatibility with WindowXP I had to declare an WIN32WINNT with a lower value like NTDDIWINXP that disables the routine definition. Otherwise it will statically link to kernel32.dll where the routine is not available on WinXP.

Negative 4928 pAfter spending way more time than seems reasonable to find an answer to this simple question, I thought I would leave my results here so others dont have to jump through all the hoops and wrong paths that I had just followed.p  pThe problem is that if you use the TcpClient ReadTimeout property and your Read operation actually times out, Microsoft decided to close the socket. This is not expected, not desirable, not done by any other socket implementation I know of, and has no valid reason that this should be the case other than programmer laziness. But this is what Microsoft chose to do.p  pAnyways, all the workarounds I found, including on this site, had various ways of doing some form of busy polling and some even involved kicking off yet another thread to perform a simple Read call.  Im sorry, but Ive got better things to do with my CPU than to sit there and busy poll, especially with many sockets open, so this is not an option for me. After all, this isnt the early 1990s where busy polling was just how you did things. Nowadays, we have this thing called operating systems that take care of these types of things quite efficiently using interrupts.p  pAnyways, on yet another tangential search I stumbled upon this old blog postp  pa hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combmflaskoarchive20060220535655.aspxhttpblogs.msdn.combmflaskoarchive20060220535655.aspxap  pMSDN Blogs  Mike Flaskos Blog  Handling a timeout when reading network data p  pThe key take aways that tell you the solution on how to properly handle read timeouts arep  blockquote   pAt this point one may be tempted to catch the exception and then reissue the read on the same NetworkStream.  This strategy can lead to unexpected errors.  The best thing to do is to now treat the NetworkStream socket as being in an unstable state.  This is because when the underlying stack times out, the underlying IO read gets cancelled.  If data comes in at the same time, the data will be lost, resulting in a corrupted data stream.p blockquote  pand the solutionp  blockquote   pA better approach is to catch the exception, close the socket or TCPClient and reconnect if necessary.  p blockquote  pWhile I still think this puts unnecessary burden on the user of the API, at least it is the most proper solution I was able to find out of the dozens of sites I looked at trying to figure out to do a semiproper socket ReadTimeout.p  pI hope this questioncomment saves somebody the hours it took me to find.p
Negative 4928 pI want to know something, I have this loop that runs for all days 7 times and then another loop inside it, that runs for all the records in the file. about 100000, so all in all its about a 700000 times, now I want to log each processing in each loop, and log that to a file, say we are inside 1st loop for first time, and 2nd loop for first time, we log each time, what is done in a file. But the problem is that if I were to log each time, it would terribly hurt the performance, because of so many IO operations, what I was thinking is that is there any way, I could log each and every step to memory memory stream or anything and then at the end of outer loop, log all that memory stream data to filep  psay if I havep  precodefor int i0 ilt7 i    for int j0 jltRecordsCount j        SomeOperation      I am logging to a file here right now     codepre  pIts hurting the performance terribly, if I remove the logging file, I could finish it a lot earlier. So I was thinking it would be better to log to memory first and write all that log from memory to file. So, is there any way to do this If there are many, whats the best  p  pemps here is a logger I found a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles23424TracerXLoggerandViewerforNET relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles23424TracerXLoggerandViewerforNETa, but I can use any other custom logger or anything else if required.emp  pstrongEDIT strong If I use memory stream, and then write it all to file, would that give me better performance then using codeFile.AppendAllLinescode as suggested in answer by Yorye and zmbq, also if would that give me any performance gain over what Jeremy commentedp

Negative 4928 pIm trying to build into a little app the ability to type text and copy it over to the canvas.    Best bet is to look at this demo a hrefhttpwww.websanova.comdemo relnofollowhttpwww.websanova.comdemoap  pClick on the T icon then start typing some text, youll notice when it actually copies over to the canvas as it will jump a few pixels.p  pThe alignment as far as the canvastextarea should be okay and the few pixels the text jumps can vary on font sizefamily and whether bolditalics is enabled or not, so basically hard coding some kind of offset will not workunless we cover all scenarios individually.  Not to mention it also varies between browsersp  pFrom what I can gather this is because of the textBaseline property but it seems that the way it aligns in a textarea and the way canvas handles it are different.p  pIve tried setting it to hangingalphabeticideographicmiddletop but cant find anything consistent between font sizefamily etc...p  pDoes anyone know of a way to possibly calculate this somehow so that it consistently positions properlyp  pCan be forked on github as well here a hrefhttpsgithub.comwebsanovawPaint relnofollowhttpsgithub.comwebsanovawPaintap

I know that code.foocode finds a set of HTML elements and returns a emjQuery objectem which is able to iterate over them using code.each...code. The internal structure of the codeeachcode method then probably calls the closure, which has been passed as a parameter.p  pBut why does codethiscode then reference the particular HTML element inside the closure I always thought that codethiscode would only reference a new scope, as far as its wrapper has been instantiated using codenewcode. So wouldnt it be much more consistent if codethiscode referenced codewindowcode insteadp

Negative 4928 pHi I am trying to figure out how to display the first image in an album that the user uploads.  I have a website that lets users upload images to albums, Now I want to display the first picture in the album as the album cover, right now when the user clicks on the albums page all that shows is the album info like name, description, etc. and I used the album name as the link to view the images in the album, what I want is the first image in the album to be displayed as link to that album. I have alot of stuff going on with this but I will try and provide everything so you can understand easier.  Here is my albums page codep  precodealbums  getalbums  ifemptyalbums echo No Albums else  foreachalbums as album     echo ltpgtlta hrefviewalbum.phpalbumid, album[id] ,gt, album[name],ltagt, album[count],  images ltbr gt     , album[description], ...ltbr gt     lta hrefeditalbum.phpalbumid, album[id] , gtEditltagt  lta hrefdeletealbum.phpalbumid, album[id] , gtDeleteltagt     ltpgt   codepre  pHere is the function from my functions php file that I include in this filep  precodefunction getalbums albums  array  albumsquery  mysqlquery SELECT albums.albumid, albums.timestamp, albums.name, LEFTalbums.description, 50 as description, COUNTimages.imageid as imagecount FROM albums LEFT JOIN images ON albums.albumid  images.albumid WHERE albums.userid   .

If the albums do not have any pics in them I plan on using a simple if statement to show a generic empty folder image.  My database using two table to upload images, the first is the albums table and the second is the images table.  I also have a timestamp field that inserts the image upload timestamp, so can i return the images from that album and the image with the lowest timestamp so to return the first image uploaded to the album Is there a SELECT statement to return this Also I did create a folder that stores these images in the corresponding albums, can i return the first image in that album What would be the easiest way to achieve thisp  pHere is how I get the images pathp  precodefunction getimagesalbumid albumid  intalbumid  images  array  imagequery  mysqlquerySELECT imageid, albumid, timestamp, ext FROM images WHERE albumid  albumid AND userid  .

And it basically works just fine.p  pI noticed, however, that it doesnt seem to distinguish between multiple open browser windows  that is, a user cannot be active in one window and inactive in another one. At the moment the activeinactive state is some global state across all Firefox windows. Thus, a user becomes really inactive, if the user is active in emallem open browser windowsp  pIs there a way to distinguish between different windows, or do I have to deal with it wouldnt be to bad, but still...

To achieve this I have started with a custom codeMediaTypeFormattercodep  precodepublic class MyXmlMediaTypeFormatter  MediaTypeFormatter       constructor, CanReadType, CanWriteType, ...      public override Taskltobjectgt ReadFromStreamAsyncType type, Stream stream,         HttpContentHeaders contentHeaders, IFormatterLogger formatterLogger              var task  Task.Factory.StartNew gt                      using var streamReader  new StreamReaderstream                              XDocument document  XDocument.LoadstreamReader                  TODO exceptions must the catched here,                  for example due to malformed XML                 XmlSchemaSet schemaSet  new XmlSchemaSet                 schemaSet.Addnull, OrderSchema.xsd                  var msgs  new Listltstringgt                 document.ValidateschemaSet, s, e gt msgs.Adde.Message                  msgs contains now the list of XML schema validation errors                  I want to send back in the response                 if msgs.Count  0                                      var order  ...  deserialize XML to order                     return objectorder                                  else                      WHAT NOW                                return task       codepre  pThis works so far as long as everything is correct.p  pBut I dont know what to do if codemsgs.Count gt 0code. How can I transfer this validation result list to the codePostcode action or how can I create a Http response that contains those XML schema validation messagesp  pAlso I am unsure if a custom codeMediaTypeFormattercode is the best extensibility point for such a XML schema validation and if my approach isnt the wrong way. Would possibly a custom codeHttpMessageHandlercodecodeDelegatingHandlercode be a better place for this Or is there perhaps something much simpler out of the boxp
Negative 4928 pI have two tabs on an ActionBar Sherlock. In some cases I want to ask the user for  confirmation if she tries to leave the current tab and stop the tab change if its not confirmed. This is mostly due to stopping a process before the user goes to fiddle with its settings on the other tab.p  pWhen I was using TabHost, I had a pretty ugly but doable solution with a OnTouchListener on the tab itself, so I could intercept the event before it ever was really handled. It seems that the ActionBar tabs cant have touch listeners, so that seems out of the question.p  pNow with ActionBar I have TabListeners that handle the detaching and attaching on the FragmentTransaction. Is there any simple way to cancel the transaction I guess I could do checks on onTabUnselected and onTabSelected and just not do the corresponding detach and attach operations but that feels a bit complicated. p  pIf stopping the tab change sounds overly stupid Im also open for other suggestions. p
Negative 4928 pI am using the internal pages feature within jQuery Mobile that works fine, but only in specific cases. Most of the links within the application use the standard loading features of jQuery where the desired page is loaded via AJAX, and the first container with codedatarolepagecode is placed in the DOM.p  pHowever, there are several pages that contain multiple containers with a codedatarolepagecode, which are intended to used as internal pages. In other words, the first codepagecode container in the HTML document contains links which will internally link to the other pages within the DOM.p  pUsing the standard loading method described above, the internal links do not work. However, reloading the page so that the entire DOM is loaded solves this issue.p  pI know I could link to this page by adding a coderelexternalcode attribute the link, but doing it that way removes all of the nice transitions that jQuery Mobile provides via the standard method of loading.p  pHow can I solve this issue without adding a coderelexternalcode attributep  pThank you for your time.p

Negative 4928 pI have grouped contacts as collections with associated subscriptions. These subscriptions are created and removed very often...p  pEach of the contacts collections can contain about 30.000  50.000 objects.p  pWhen creating subscriptions for 30.000 contacts, I iterate over the contacts collection and fill an array of sql values. After that, I manually execute a single sql insert statement with all these valuesp  precodesqlvalues  [] contacts.each do contact   sqlvalues ltlt [contact.id, newsletter.id, contactgroupid] end if sqlvalues.any   ActiveRecordBase.connection.execute     INSERT INTO subscriptions contactid, newsletterid, contactgroupid VALUES sqlvalues.join,       sqlvalues  nil end codepre  pThe SQL insert takes just a second or so, thats okay. The select on the contacts takes about 15 seconds on my development machine 8GB RAM. The production machine just has 1GB RAM...p  pWhat would be your approach to reduce that timep  pEDIT My problem is actsastaggable which joins the contacts with the tags table. Anyone knows a good solution handling big collections with taggings on the objectsp  pThank youp
Negative 4928 pI have a thumbdrive that has been encrypted by Bitlock in Win7.br When the thumbdrive is plugged into a nonWindows machine, for instance Linux, it appears that the disk is full no free space is available.br Is there a way to tell if a thumbdrive, or a harddisk, is encrypted by Bitlockp  pMy guess is that there is a header or flag in the filesystem with which we could check if the storage media has been encrypted by Bitlock.p  pAny thoughtspointers would be greatly appreciated.p  pwith kind regards,br Justinp  hr  pwith some investigation i seems to get the idea Bitlock encrypts the disk by packing everything into several data files, including existing files, and the empty space of the disk. it also put an autorun.inf onto the disk, which will invoke the BitLockerToGo.exe to prompt the user to enter the passwordkey. after that my guess is Bitlocker decrypts the data files so that we could access it as normal, not sure though. anyway, a notsogood solution is to check if you can find the autorun.inf, Bitlocker.exe and other related files on the disk, if yes, you will be able to tell the disk has been encrypted.p

Negative 4928 pI want to convert a Subversion repository subdirectory denoted by codemodulecode here into a git repository with full history.

It simply pops up a blank webview for a couple of seconds and then disappears... At this point, it calls the FBSesstionStateHandler block with the state set to FBSessionStateOpen, however, fails to call the FBSessionReauthorizeResultHandler defined within the completionHandler. p  pHowever, if I simply set the behaviour to default FBSessionLoginBehaviorWithFallbackToWebView it works fine by passing the request back and forth between facebook appsafari and completes the call by calling the completionHandler correctly. However, with the default behaviour it does not force the  user to reenter hisher password.p  pSo I am really confused, and the sdk docs on the web are not very useful for my case. Could someone please advise me on what I am doing wrong... or weather its a known bug in the SDK  If so, how can I go about meeting my requirements p  precodevoid reauthThroughFacebook   if  self.facebookSession.isOpen ampamp self.facebookSession.state  FBSessionStateCreatedTokenLoaded      [self.facebookSession openWithBehavior FBSessionLoginBehaviorWithNoFallbackToWebView                           completionHandler self.stateHandler]    if  self.facebookSession.isOpen       [self.facebookSession reauthorizeWithPermissions self.userPermissions                                             behavior FBSessionLoginBehaviorForcingWebView                                    completionHandlerFBSession session, NSError error                                        if self.facebookSession  session                                             [self completedReauthWithSuccesserror  nil errorerror]                                                                            ]  else      [self completedReauthWithSuccessNO error[NSError errorWithDomain No active session found.                                                                   code FBErrorInvalid userInfo nil]]    codepre  pAlso, once the reauth web view pops up correctly, how do I ensure that the users email address is auto populated and block the user form changing it  Can I access the web view within the facebook sdk to set these propertiesp  pFinally, what happens to the access token and expiry date if the reauth takes place with the same permissions as login p  pThank you in advance,p

Negative 4928 pFirst, I am going to give a summary of what I need  to achieve. I have an acquisition system that receives at least two different types of data over time that I have to incorporate on a state estimation framework. There are two main scenarios regarding the data receptionp  ol liType strongAstrong Some data can be incorporated directly as it arrives 10 Hz, a FIFO queue would be enough for this.li liType strongBstrong Unfortunately, some of the data requires more processing 1 second so that it is incorporated to the estimation framework with a delay. In this case I have to strong1strong recover the past state of the framework at the reception of the type strongBstrong before processing then strong2strong use the type strongBstrong data to recompute the state at that time, and then strong3strong go forward in time incorporating all the type strongAstrong data received in the meantime the data is incorporated respecting the time ordering.li ol  pFrom the C programming point of view, I am thinking on the following solutionp  ul liDefine a general codetimeSamplecode class. So that every kind of data will be encapsulated in classes that inherit from the codetimeSamplecode mother class. Thus I will have something like codetimeSampleAcode and codetimeSampleBcode that can be dynamically cast from a codetimeSamplecode pointer. This is useful when the samples are passed back to the estimation framework, because it can now the kind of sample it is and call the appropriate function.li liFor each timeSample child class there is a circular buffer. So codetimeSampleAcode data is stored in codecircularBufferlttimeSampleAgtcode, codetimeSampleBcode data is stored in codecircularBufferlttimeSampleBgtcode and so on.li liA codemultisetlttimeSamplegtcode is used to store the time ordered pointers of the samples some of the pointers point to data inside codecircularBufferlttimeSampleAgtcode, and other to data inside the codecircularBufferlttimeSampleBgtcode. The codetimeSamplecode pointers are ordered using the time field inside the codetimeSamplecode instance that stores the time instant where the sample was received.li liAll the containers would be included in the same class, to ensure that the data is managed correctly.

Negative 4928 pI recently took a stab at implementing a concurrent priority queue using a skiplist data structure  for the sake of this question, if you dont know what a skiplist is, I believe just picturing a linked list would be sufficient enough to answer. I attempted minimal locking i.e. allowing multiple enqueues and dequeues simultaneously, only locking nodes or their forward pointers if necessary, releasing locks as soon as possible, traversing the list using Interlockeds, etc.p  pI was pleased with the results. However, writing a regular skiplist with the add and remove surrounded by a syncroot lock i.e. only allowing one operation at any given time, was actually twice as fast. p  pI assumed that I must have bug in my implementation. However, even a Concurrent Priority Queue listed on the Microsoft website, only actually allows for one operation at a time i.e. a syncroot lock around enqueue and dequeuep  pa hrefhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comSamplesforParallelb4b76364sourcecodefileId44488amppathId1696822056 relnofollowhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comSamplesforParallelb4b76364sourcecodefileId44488amppathId1696822056ap  pAs a general rule, and forgive me if this question is too general, at what point does more granular locking actually lead to a performance improvement I imagine that in my case, since I actually have to traverse large lists with Interlocked.Exchange is there a better way as well as multiple test and test and sets, etc, that this slows down the enqueues and dequeues. p  pAdditionally, is there a tool that could help me determine where the majority of the time is being spent Thanks.p

Negative 4928 pIm using emacs eshell and would like to search back through my command history.

Negative 4928 pSo, I am done with a project, now the main issue I am facing is the strongMemory Leakagestrong in the application emleak meaning you keep a reference to an activity, thus preventing the GC from collecting itemp  pSome of the cases I found, where the memory leakage occurs arep  h2Context Leakageh2  pIt occurs because of long lived reference to the activity context.p  pA very good example of it i found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq65676471626878herea,p  precodeprivate static Drawable sBackground  Override protected void onCreateBundle state    super.onCreatestate    TextView label  new TextViewthis   label.setTextLeaks are bad    if sBackground  null      sBackground  getDrawableR.drawable.largebitmap      label.setBackgroundDrawablesBackground    setContentViewlabel  codepre  phere the problem is with codeprivate static Drawable sBackgroundcode The static Drawable is created with the Activity as the context, so in THAT case, theres a static reference to a Drawable that references the Activity, and thats why theres a leak. As long as that reference exists, the Activity will be kept in memory, leaking all of its views.p  h2Screen orientation changeh2  pThe second case that draws the attention is when the screen orientation changes. When the screen orientation changes the system will, by default, destroy the current activity and create a new one while preserving its state. In doing so, Android will reload the applications UI from the resources. Now imagine you wrote an application with a large bitmap that you dont want to load on every rotation.p  pThis will result in a lot of memory leakage as there could be large bitmaps to load.p  h2contextactivityh2  pThe third case, I found was the reference to the activity context. It also results in memory leakage.p  pI wonder if there is any easy way to avoid such memory leakages from happening. or if there could be tool  to check and remove those memory leakages from the application.p
Negative 4928 pI am writing a simple program for iPhone using jQuery mobile, I have created a div with number of images but the scroller that is coming is vertical which I dont want. I want vertical space to be fixed and overflow of images horizontally. I know there a re scrolling plugin like iScroll but in my case I cant use them because those scrolling plugins uses codeltligtcode with fixed number of elements to be showed on that page but I want to keep this dynamic, if user rotates his device horizontally then more images can fit in the screen so I want that adjustment that if user keep his device vertical then horizontally there is less space so images should scroll horizontally but if he rotates device horizontally then he gets more space  horizontally and more images can fit in and leftover images will again scroll horizontally.p  pI fixed the height of div and tried overflow property to let images flow horizontally but I guess jQuery is preventing that behavior.p  pcan you please put me on correct path.p

Negative 4928 pIm a noob to Node.js and Express  Im having an issue with accessing the socket.io object in other modules. I have created a global variable to hold a socket object however as soon as that user closes the connection the connection isnt available anymore. Technically I guess the connection still lives on but I delete it for resource reasons. p  pstrongNotice below everytime a connection is made we assign that socket to the global variable which is accessible to all other modules.strong p  precode App.js var io  requiresocket.io.listenserver  var sessionsConnections    io.sockets.onconnection, function socket        global.socket  socket      sessionsConnections[socket.id]  socket      .....   socket.ondisconnect, function       delete sessionsConnections[socket.id]    Match.js      global.socket.emitlobbycreateMatch, data codepre  pIf the connection last assigned to the global closes Match.js will be screwed. At this point Match.js is the only module who will ever need that socket.io reference.

We previously did Java to Java, and are now having to get the Objective C portion working. p  pThe code is herePlease note, this is just a very small snippet of the code in comparison to the whole projectp  precode NSTextField addFieldWithTitleNSString aTitle at NSRect aRect  NSTextField label [[[NSTextField alloc] initWithFrame aRect] autorelease] [label setSelectable YES] [label setEditable YES] [label setBezeled YES] [label setDrawsBackground YES] [label setStringValue aTitle] [[window contentView] addSubview label] return label  codepre  pOn my Mac it shows up properly, and allows each field to be selected each field that NEEDS to be selected, that is. But the problem is as follows After selecting the field, you cannot type anything. Whatever is typed is then received by the previous program  application you had open just prior to selecting this program that shows up. It appears to not register it properly at all, because it doesnt type at all. p  pWhat makes it even more interesting is that I can right click or control click the editable fields, and then select paste and it will paste the strings that I had previously copied to the clip board...p  pSo thats my interesting issue, and I cant seem to find any answers and my classmates cannot find answers either.p  pAny assistance would be greatly appreciatedp  pRegards, Michaelp  pP.S.

The internal reference count of the returned handle is unaffected.pli lipCreate a new handle of A. The internal reference count is preincremented, and the handle should be released by the client with function 4, otherwise a leak will occur.pli lipTell the dll to internally increase the reference count of a handle A. This allows us to be sure that the dll will not internally release a handle that we have acquired through function 1.pli lipTell the dll to decrease the ref count of a handle.

When I acquire handles by creating new ones, the procedure is obvious the handles ref count is preincremented inside the dll, so I just override the Release function of SafeHandle, and call releaseHandleToAhandle.

Negative 4928 pI recently ported a fairly large application from C to Java. It ought to have about 6 main threads running and lots of timers being fired but each executing only briefly. I make use of the Timer class and call myTimer.schedulenew TimerTask  ...p  pNow that Im at the end of the port, Im having a problem debugging the application in Eclipse, especially lately. I set a breakpoint Eclipse will hit it but I cant step through at that point. I dont think I can look at variable values or stack trace or anything. p  pI see my list of threads going crazy, and based on output statements Ive written, I can see that Thread.activeCount gets to be over 200 threads. I am curious as to whether this is my debugging problem. Have I overloaded Eclipse to the point that it goes crazyp  pFrom the threads I can actually see, most of them are my Timers that have been run. Somewhere I read that the JVM will keep those alive even if you cancel them . Anyway, if its including all of the timers Ive fired then perhaps over 200 threads makes sense. p  pI did once today also see an Eclipse out of memory error.p  pAny advice Thanks.p

Negative 4928 pSo, just some context here. Im academically trained in C, but Im just trying to learn php on my own. As a result, I think I have several coding tendencies that spring from C being my fallback language that may not sit well with php.p  pSo, heres what Im trying to do. Im making a contour mapping application. The contour map will eventually be drawn to the html5 canvas operation, but first, Im doing all the math with php.p  pSo, I have my data array to be mapped, as well as a 2 dimensional array for holding the colorvalues that will eventually be drawn to a an html canvas. However, to attain their values, each pixel needs to have three array attributes that can hold information about the nearest data points on the contour map. So, I made a class called pixel. However, it got a bit complicated when I had to make a 2d array of these classes and modify the value attribute of each individual one. I know how to do this in C, but Im not sure Im doing it properly in php. As a result, Im getting an error about an unexpected end of file, which, again, I think may be attributed to me dealing with classes incorrectly.

Negative 4928 pI know that for freestanding classes, you should avoid calling the assignment operator in your copy constructor.  Copy and swap and moving the reused code to a private member function are two ways to easily reuse code.  However, recently I ran into a bit of a problem.  Heres the codep  precode Derived.h class Derived  Base     bunch of fun stuff here    ...    constructor that builds a derived object from a base one   explicit Derivedconst Baseamp base    Assignment operator for moving base class member variables into the derived one   Derivedamp operatorconst Baseamp base   Derived.cpp DerivedDerivedconstamp Base base    this  base  use assignment operator from derived to base  Derivedamp Derivedoperatorconst Baseamp base    staticcastltBasegtthis  base   call base class assignment operator  codepre  pIn this given application, this all actually makes sense, because the derived class can now perform operations on the members it just received from the base class to fill in the rest of the object.  Also, this provides a safe way for the user to convert a base object to a derived object.  What I seem to be missing is whether or not such code is good code practice, or if there is an easierbetter way to accomplish what I am trying to do  As I mentioned before, I know its generally a nogo to call the assignment operator from a copy constructor in a freestanding class, but what about calling the assignment operator from another constructor  p

Negative 4928 pSay I have a class called Player, which is persisted with hibernate, and has both a generated ID and a composite natural id.  Player is a complex class which stores a hierarchy of other objects that also have generated Ids.p  pI can query a json web service to get an instance of Player.  The json gets parsed by Jackson, which builds a full Player object, except it wont have any of the generated Ids.  I essentially want to do a saveOrUpdate on this instance of player.p  pOne option would be query the database for a Player object by natural id.  If no object is returned, do a save.  Otherwise, manually copy all the values of the Player object and all its fields from the web service to the object from the database, then do an update.  I dont like this option since it seems inefficient and would include a lot of extra code.p  pWhat I would prefer to do is just copy the generated Ids from the database object to the object from the web service, then do an update on that.

Negative 4928 pI have created a workflow system where users can see their work in a queue, mark it complete, and create an outgoing correspondence letter. In the Access DB, essentially they are going into each record which has an Incomplete indicator and marking items as Complete from the queue table.  After doing this, an insert is triggered, which inserts customer data based on that record being marked into a letter table.  A pdf is then batchedprinted based on the inserted data from this letter table.p  pThe beginning scope of the project was a single transaction type with essentially limited data fields Such as Name, Address, State, Zip.  I am finding now that I am being asked to expand the transaction types in the queue.  Different letters however, require different fields and not all fields are readily available for each letter Some letters need and have an account issued date, others do not, etc.p  pMy question pertains to the methodology of expanding the fields available for letter insert.  I need to add more fields for the new transaction types in the letter table.  But these fields are transaction specific, so for example, I may have some kind of audit letter that does not use account premiums, but now I have another transaction that uses only account premiums.  All my letters in the table will share that field if I create it, regardless of whether they actually use it or not. So if that is the case, how should I deal with the nulls I am wondering if I should still create the field aptly named such as AccountPremium, or should i use generic names like extraField1 and just match it to the point in the letter  p

For example  either on edit or on a daily timer  a Google Script would read the list of email addresses in Column A and update the corresponding Google Group.p  pIdeally, the script would call the current Google Group membership, compare it to the list of email addresses in Column A, delete from the Group any addresses that no longer appear in Column A, and add to the Group any addresses that appear in Column A but are not currently in the Group. p  pThis may be asking for too much. So alternatively, I can imagine the script deleting all members from the Group, then adding all the email addresses in Column A to the Group. While this would accomplish the same objective as far as I can see, I wonder whether there would be some history lost or some similar side effect to erasing all members on a routine basis. Thus, I prefer the comparison approach first described. p  pIn the forum, I can find this discussion, with a reply from Serge insas a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20118937addemailadresstospreadsheetautoaddtheemailtoagooglegroupAdd emailadress to Spreadsheet, auto add the email to a Google groupap  pWhen I run this code in my script editor, replacing testgroupdomain.com with the email address for my Google Group, I get the following error p  blockquote   pService error  Invalid request URIp blockquote  pwith a reference to line 10, which is p  precodevar group  GroupsManager.getGrouptestgroupdomain.com codepre  pGetting past that error is 1 problem.

Plan B is instead to write a script that will compare the spreadsheet user list to the Google Group user list and tell me which users need to be manually added to  removed from the Google Group user list. Ive adapted the code you provided in the post you linked me to. p  precode    function compareGroupMembers          var sheet  SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet.getSheetByNameGroups       var rows  sheet.getDataRange       var values  rows.getValues       var sheetUsers  []     Logger.logvalues       Get user list from sheet       for var i  1 i lt values.length i          var row  values[i]         sheetUsers.pushrow[0]  build array of users              Logger.logsheetUsers       Get user list from group       var group  GroupsApp.getGroupByEmailmygroupgooglegroups.com       var groupUsers  group.getUsers.join,.split,       Logger.loggroupUsers       Compare user lists and define users to Add and Remove     This is where I need direction. This code is just a placeholder.       var usersToAdd  sheetUsers.uniqueFromgroupUsers       var usersToRemove  groupUsers.uniqueFromsheetUsers       var addErrors  0  Counter for exceptions      Then I would like usersToAdd and usersToRemove to be listed in a separate sheet     Because I have six groups, Im hoping the new sheet can be organized by     Col A is Google Group email     Col B is user email     Col C is add or delete       codepre  pIs it possible to create an output that tells me which members to manually add i.e. those that are on the sheet list but not on the group list and those to manually delete i.e. those who are on the group list but are not on the sheet listp  pAdditionally, can I have the same script do the same thing for six different groups in my sheet the group email address is in row 1, and the member email addresses are directly under it, for all 6 columns If it is possible, then I would want the output to specify which group the user must be manually added to or deleted from. p  pThanks for your helpp
Negative 4928 pText rendering is one of the hard topic to be understood for most new comers. and right now, i got stuck here. well id like to ask wheter my way is good idea to render text.. OpenGL does not have builtin functionality to render text to the screen, thats make me confused. after searching, that the text render is using bitmap.p  pstrongLoad and bind bitmap font texture  Parse text and generate and bind vertices array, mapping texture with uv array,...  Render it to screenstrongp  pok this may can solve how to render text, but i still stuck. for example what if i make strongtimer based Textstrong  that change every strongmillisecondstrong since i draw text just like  MinuteSecondMili Second this is not good idea right since i must repeat that algorithm while i want to change the text. i guess if we keep using bitmap the machine would get slower.p  pwell, seeing bitmap text rendering is so slow, i make some way to render text without bitmap perhaps it would be get better thats why i ask herep  phere is how i draw character model with strong3d Vertex  GLOrthostrong just take look at my vector font code example How to draw L character with Vectorp  precode    const float MAXHEIGHT  18.0f set maximum height of character     const float MAXWIDTH  20.0f  set maximum width of character  void drawLGLfloat x,GLfloat y            glPushMatrix         ive set before glOrtho0, Window.width, Window.height, 0, 0, 1         glTranslatefx,y,0.0f         glBeginGLQUADS         glVertex3f0.0f,0.0f,0.0f       draw vertical quad         glVertex3f3.0f,0.0f,0.0f         glVertex3f3.0f,MAXHEIGHT,0.0f         glVertex3f0.0f,MAXHEIGHT,0.0f          glNormal3f0.0f,MAXHEIGHT,0.0f  draw horizontal quad         glVertex3f2.0f,MAXHEIGHT,0.0f         glVertex3fMAXWIDTH  10.0f,MAXHEIGHT,0.0f         glVertex3fMAXWIDTH  10.0f,MAXHEIGHT  3.0f,0.0f         glVertex3f2.0f,MAXHEIGHT  3.0f,0.0f         glEnd         glPopMatrix      codepre  pthere are some advantages if we draw character with vectorGLQUAD vertex if you would like to resize the font will not getting blur.p  pthe question now will this getting slower if i make timer based text that change every Milisecond  with this way, repeat the algorithm is unnecessary if im gonna change the text. they are not even consume much resource because its not bitmap, it just vector rendering.p

Negative 4928 pI have created a windows service that consumes messages from a RabbitMq. The consumption is done in a async manner, where messages are pushed to the service.p  pIt scales well horizontally with an approx. linear performance gain, even when just creating more service instances on the same server.

For now its just a mashup of things I am trying.p  pI think I might be going about this all wrong, but Im very new at all this.p

Negative 4928 pAll,p  pJust wanted to know if it is possible to access the mobile browser cookie through Worklight app Has anyone tried this before Is it even possible with Cordova plugins or any other viable approach p  pThe typical use case is when the user clicks on any URLview website in the Worklight app that will direct to mobile website which will be opened on the mobile web browserSafari or Chrome. And when the user logs out of the website on the mobile browser, we want the app to be logged out as well. The next time user gets the app to foreground, user should be challenged for authentication. So how we do access the browser cookiecache to see if the user is logged out of the website on the mobile browser p  pThanks Paulp

Negative 4928 pI cant seem to get a jQuery AJAX post to update a div with the returned partial view.

Negative 4928 pI have a strange situation. I have a stateless bean which copy data from one DB to another, and based on a date record in that data being copied, it set a timer to trigger another task in the future or immediately.

Everything works very smooth except one thing. In that asynchronous method when i create that timer and the method reach he enclosing parenthesis  a roll back exception is thrown, and when i comment the line that create the timer the copying is done very well and quickly.p  pI tried to catch the exception and its as followingp  pI WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR HELPp  pjavax.ejb.EJBTransactionRolledbackException nested exception is javax.transaction.RollbackException     at com.ibm.ejs.container.BusinessExceptionMappingStrategy.mapCSIExceptionBusinessExceptionMappingStrategy.java167     at com.ibm.ejs.container.BusinessExceptionMappingStrategy.mapCSITransactionRolledBackExceptionBusinessExceptionMappingStrategy.java618     at com.ibm.ejs.container.EJSDeployedSupport.mapCSITransactionRolledBackExceptionEJSDeployedSupport.java700     at com.ibm.ejs.container.EJSContainer.postInvokeRolledbackExceptionEJSContainer.java4826     at com.ibm.ejs.container.EJSContainer.postInvokeEJSContainer.java4577     at com.hishom.enhanced.da.entry.business.dynamicapproval.next.EJSLocal0SLGetNextApproversaf73153c.prepareNextApproversEJSLocal0SLGetNextApproversaf73153c.java     at com.hishom.db.migration.DataCopier.getMissingRemainingApproversDataCopier.java266     at com.hishom.db.migration.DataCopier.copyDataDataCopier.java206     at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0Native Method     at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invokeNativeMethodAccessorImpl.java60     at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invokeDelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java37     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java611     at com.ibm.ejs.container.AsyncMethodWorkWrapper.runAsyncMethodWorkWrapper.java231     at com.ibm.ws.asynchbeans.J2EEContextRunProxy.runJ2EEContext.java269     at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedAccessController.java273     at com.ibm.ws.asynchbeans.J2EEContext.runJ2EEContext.java795     at com.ibm.ws.asynchbeans.WorkWithExecutionContextImpl.goWorkWithExecutionContextImpl.java222     at com.ibm.ws.asynchbeans.ABWorkItemImpl.runABWorkItemImpl.java206     at com.ibm.ws.util.ThreadPoolWorker.runThreadPool.java1862 Caused by javax.transaction.RollbackException     at com.ibm.tx.jta.impl.TransactionImpl.stage3CommitProcessingTransactionImpl.java1254     at com.ibm.tx.jta.impl.TransactionImpl.processCommitTransactionImpl.java1028     at com.ibm.tx.jta.impl.TransactionImpl.commitTransactionImpl.java949     at com.ibm.ws.tx.jta.TranManagerImpl.commitTranManagerImpl.java439     at com.ibm.tx.jta.impl.TranManagerSet.commitTranManagerSet.java191     at com.ibm.ejs.csi.TranStrategy.commitTranStrategy.java949     at com.ibm.ejs.csi.TranStrategy.postInvokeTranStrategy.java262     at com.ibm.ejs.csi.TransactionControlImpl.postInvokeTransactionControlImpl.java567     at com.ibm.ejs.container.EJSContainer.postInvokeEJSContainer.java4491     ... 14 more p  pUPDATEp  pbkail..I found a work around but i will need your help.

Negative 4928 pSo Ive got a very frequentlyrun query on my SQL server instance thats generating a lot of wait time. On examining the Plan, I was pointed in the direction of a clustered index seek thats accountable for 93 of the cost of the whole operation.p  pExamining the clustered index, I discovered that while it has 0 fragmentation listed, it has a page fullness value of only 23. From all the research Ive done, I cant really find any indication of why you would want page fullness to be low, and am anticipating that Ill want to do an index reorganize operation to set the value to something more like 90. This table is very frequently read from and written to, and I am led to believe too high a page fullness value creates slowdown during write operations, hence why I dont set it to something like 99 or 100.p  pMy question is this Is there any reason I shouldnt reorganize the index and set the page fill factor to 90 or so Any downside to doing that I need this query, and the SQL text itself has already been optimized through Lync.p

Negative 4928 pI have an XML file from a third party and it is broken up into nonstatic length lines delimited with Line Feeds. p  pThere is also a strange first character that needs to be stripped from the file.p  pI am fairly certain that the two items above are causing issues loading the XML file with SSIS. If I remove them by hand from a smaller sample, the XML file loads fine thru SSIS. p  pAt this point Ive tried using both SSIS and Powershell to attempt to fix the file.p  pSSIS resulted in strangely adding delimiters back in. p  pMy attempts using Powershell were a little more fruitful on a small subset of the data, but my actual file will regularly be in excess of 2GB and I keep getting System.OutOfMemory exceptions. I have increased the maxmemorypershellmb for Powershell and restarted winrm but it seems to have had no effect preventing the OutOfMemory error.p  pCurrent Powershell attempts that work with a small sample file p  precodejoin GetContent CCodeinput.xml replace w,   SetContent Path CCodeoutputnolinefeed.xml  join GetContent CCodeoutputnolinefeed.xml.substring1  SetContent Path CCodeoutputnolinefeedremovefirstchar.xml codepre  pIf both of the above commands run on the sample file, it will then import into SSIS XML Source  Derived Column  SQL Server Destination. p  pLooking at it in Notepad below, see how it appears to have some type of black smudge on the less than character. The other less than characters all appear normal. Also, the neon green is some type of space I can select as well. p  pWhen I open the file, it is UTF8. Choosing Encoding  Covert to ASCII results in the space and less than character being converted to a single question mark.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comL5eLe.png altenter image description herep  pReasons for weird first character and line feeds aside assuming both cannot be handled with SSIS, at this point I need some command line editor that will gracefully handle large files. p

Negative 4928 pIm currently trying to find out how to properly use the codesharedptrcode feature of C11 in C APIs. The main area where I need it is in container classes Like nodes in a scene graph for example which may contain a list of child nodes and a reference to the parent node and stuff like that. Creating copies of the nodes is not an option and using references or pointers is pain in the ass because no one really knows who is responsible for destructing the nodes And when someone destructs a node which is still referenced by some other node the program will crash.p  pSo I think using codesharedptrcode may be a good idea here. Lets take a look at the following simplified example Which demonstrates a child node which must be connected to a parent nodep  precodeinclude ltmemorygt include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  class Parent   class Child      private         sharedptrltParentgt parent     public         Childconst sharedptrltParentgtamp parent  parentparent          Parentamp getParent  return parent.get    int main       Create parent     sharedptrltParentgt parentnew Parent       Create child for the parent     Child childparent       Some other code may need to get the parent from the child again like this     Parentamp p  child.getParent      ...              return 0  codepre  pThis API forces the user to use a codesharedptrcode for creating the actual connection between the child and the parent. But in other methods I want a more simple API, thats why the codegetParentcode method returns a reference to the parent and not the codesharedptrcode. p  pMy first question is Is this a correct usage of codesharedptrcode Or is there room for improvementp  pMy second question is How do I properly react on nullpointers Because the codegetParentcode method returns a reference the user may think it never can return NULL. But thats wrong because it will return NULL when someone passes a shared pointer containing a nullpointer to the constructor. Actually I dont want null pointers. The parent must always be set. How do I properly handle this By manually checking the shared pointer in the constructor and throwing an exception when it contains NULL Or is there a better way Maybe some sort of nonnullablesharedpointerp

Negative 4928 pSo I am working on this but of jQuery that gets the element id through a click event. This then triggers a function that acts like the deprecated .toggle it slides an element down on the fist click and slides that element up on the second click. However, there is a bug that causes the element to slide up and down the amount of times that it has been clicked on. For instance, if this is the second time I use the .clickToggle function, the element table slides up and down twice before settling, and so on. I suspect it has something to do with the event object, e, tracking the number of clicks i.e. I probably shouldnt set id  e.target.id but Im not sure how to fix while still getting the relevant element id that I need.p  pHere is the relevant clickToggle plug in courtesy of an answer here on stackoverflow. p  precodefunction          .fn.clickToggle  functionfunc1, func2              var funcs  [func1, func2]             this.datatoggleclicked, 0             this.clickfunction                  var data  this.data                 var tc  data.toggleclicked                 .proxyfuncs[tc], this                 data.toggleclicked  tc  1  2                          return this              jQuery codepre  pHere is the buggy code that fits the above description. p  precodedocument.clickfunctione           get the mouse info, and parse out the relevant generated div num          var id   e.target.id          var strId  id.matchd           clickToggle the individual table         showTable  strId.clickTogglefunction               table  strId.slideDown             table  strId.loadfiles.php               ,         function               table  strId.slideUp               close mousemove function codepre  pAny help would be much appreciated.

How do I fix this Is there a flag that will generate Boost libs with the naming convention If yes, I can rebuild boost. If not, how do I tell Boost to pickup the libs I havep  pP.S I did try adding boostatomic.lib to additional libraries, but it keeps asking for that specific lib I have defined BOOSTSPUSEPTHREADSp

Negative 4928 pI am trying to make a Record Type that contains unique values, and would act as the target reference objects to another Record Type. For example, Record Type  Movies would contain unique list of movies submitted by users. And FavoriteMovies would contain a Users reference and a Movies reference. Users could select from a list of existing Movies, or add new ones to it.p  pThe problem happens if I create a new Movies record, while another user creates a new record with the same name after I retrieved the list of movies, but before I attempt to add a new one. The two new records are considered different records with different recordIDs. This means that once I saved the new one, there will be two instances of Movies with the save name.p  pIm not able to find a way to perform a Save If Not Exists type operation to the Movies Record Type. I could do a save in the completionBlock of a query, but those two actions would not be an atomic transaction to guarantee uniqueness. As far as I know this is also the case with chaining codeCKQueryOperationcode with codeCKModifyRecordsOperationcode.p  pIs there a way to insert a record only if the value does not exists in a single transactionp

Negative 4928 pIm trying to post a ZIParchive. p  pI have a website, where a file can be uploaded. The file is simply picked with a file chooser. When the uploadbutton is clicked, the website reloads itself. Before the site reloads, it checks, if there was a file submitted with POST. So if a file was chosen, the file is copied to a folder including some renaming operations. This is the whole upload process on my website, and it works fine.p  pI want to use this service in my Android app. I just want to submit the file, so that the PHP code can do the rest.

Some research showed me, that I have to use the value of the nametag of that field of my form, which contains the value, which I want to post. In my case that would be the file chooser, which has the name fileupload. Or should I take the name of my form, which is upload Another point, which confuses me is the value of filename. Should I use the whole path, for example pathtoandroid.app.zip or should I just use the filename android.app.zipp  pAdditionally I think, that there have to be more errors, because I tried all combinations of name and filename.p  pI hope someone finds the errors.p  pThanks for your helpp

Since codeNoOfBoxescode will decide the amount of records and I would only need to duplicate the value of codeMergeNocode and codeisCommissioncode to the subform. But the problem is, I need to also auto fill the item, which made me think of solutions number 2.p  pThe reasoning behind going with number 2 is my receive report header doesnt contains the item information and since a subform can only have 1 type of item but multiple of them. I was hitting toward number 2.p  pSolution number 2 would be multiple unbound fields which pulled the information into a combo box, or enter the information needed and hit a button which will then transfer all that data to the subform and create the correct amount of records.p  punbound fields  itemcode, mergeNo, isCommission, and NoOfBoxes.p

Negative 4928 pLots of time spent with other languagetemplatingengine combinations, however fairly new to JSF and have the pleasure of taking over a legacy JSF 1.1 project that uses a a hrefhttpmvnrepository.comartifactjavax.facesjsfimpl1.102 relnofollowbasic Sun JSF liba and for political reasons can not be updated to something more modern like JSF 2.2 with PrimeFaces or IceFaces, which Id personally like to do after reading up on the capabilities of those.p  pThe setup is a simple web app with landing page plus two tabs Person amp Address, each powered by their own Backing Beans and JSF pages. Six total navigation states as each tab starts with a Search Form page which leads to a Search Results page on submit and then a View page emonmousedownem click action of an individual result for each of Person amp Address data. The Search Form pages are sessionscoped, and designed to pass search parameters around to each other in a header box entitled Users Search Query. It does this because the Search Results page for Address searches is really an overloaded Person search result with Address thrown in for Search for People by Address. Yes this could all probably be accomplished from a single page with some optional search params, but its not, and for whatever reason Im not permitted to change the core page structure, just tasked to bug fix.p  pTheres a longstanding bug Ive been asked to fix, where one page Person always shows search parameters from the other Address when both are set, because of some incomplete logic inside the panelGrid where the search query parameters are displayedp  precodelthoutputText valueCoverage Typegt lthoutputText valueaddressSearchUI.searchParameters.coverageType     renderedempty personSearchUI.searchParameters.coverageTypegt lthoutputText valuepersonSearchUI.searchParameters.coverageType    renderedempty personSearchUI.searchParameters.coverageTypegt codepre  pA little too overly simplistic if a Person searchs Coverage Type was set, use that, but if not, try to use the Address coverageType search parameter. Works great when only one or the other were set.p  pstrongPROBLEM CASESstrong Since they are session scoped, what if both of them were set in separate searches and were on the Address page The value from the old Person search displays and vice versa this is the main problem. What if neither of them are set yet It should show a default value of ALL COVERAGE, easy enough to add but doesnt address that main problem.p  pSOLUTION Thought this would be an easy fix but Ive hit a major wall trying to do either one of the following two simple things that I think would solve my problemp  pA get the sessionscoped value of one pages search parameter and reset it or set to empty string then that naiive presentation logic could be left as isp  pB call the reset button of one page programmatically from Java when backing bean init method gets called as we switch tabs I can call the method but am not sure how to get the original session instance rather than creating a new one, which will fire to a nonexistent page UIwisep  hr  pHeres what Ive tried so farp  pA Adding an strongactionListenerstrong attribute to the submit button itself and trying to forcibly reset values from the other Search Form. p  precodelthcommandButton        idpersonReset        styleClasssubmitButton        valueReset             actiontransactionSearchUI.resetSearchgt  lthcommandButton        idpersonSearch            styleClasssearchButton       valueSearch       renderedpersonSearchUI.canDo[performSearch]        actionListeneraddressSearchUI.resetSearch       actionpersonSearchUI.performSearchgt codepre  pB In the backing bean of each search, try to invoke the reset button of the otherp  precode utility method    private UIComponent findComponentString id, UIComponent where         if where  null            return null                else if where.getId.equalsid            return where                else            ListltUIComponentgt childrenList  where.getChildren           if childrenList  null  childrenList.isEmpty               return null                      for UIComponent child  childrenList               UIComponent result  null              result  findComponentid, child              ifresult  null                  return result                                  return null            ... then inside init method that is called when Person tab loads  FacesContext facesContext  FacesContext.getCurrentInstance UIViewRoot root  facesContext.getViewRoot       HtmlCommandButton button  HtmlCommandButton findComponentaddressReset, root ActionEvent actionEvent  new ActionEventbutton actionEvent.queue codepre  pFails with NullPointerException, so clearly cant access one tab from the others backing bean in this way unless Im missing something.p  pC JavaScript approach to reset values from one tab to the otherp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt function clearAddressSearchParams      document.getElementByIdAddressSearchaddressSearchaddressReset.click     document.forms[AddressSearchaddressSearch].reset     return false  window.onload  clearStats ltscriptgt codepre  pNeither of those clientside methods of trying to fire the Reset button action are going to work, since again, the Person and Address Search Forms were setup as two totally separate beans and pages even though one ultimately extends the other, one wont be active or available in the DOM so it wont find the elements.p  pAt this point, I know there is clearly a simpler solution, but Im at my wits end and probably coming at this from the wrong angle, so I dont know what else to do but put up a bounty for some of the JSF geniuses here. But if anyone can suggest a fix given my limitations of older JSF technology, no adding external libs and maintaining same basic code structure, youll get the bounty and tons of appreciation.p  pEDIT To summarize all this into a single question, can anyone suggest a reliable legacyJSF 1.1 compatible way to flush a session variable or reset it, independently of its page where it gets set being activep

The size after this file is converted goes from about 560MB to 1.81 gigs, Which seems about right for the string size of the values.p  pSmaller files such as 100000 samples and 256 channels open fine and look correct. p  pAccording to Excels docs, it should be able to display over 1 million rows and something like 16000 columns.p  pI wrote a Python script to check the file and it has 550,000 lines in it as it should. I also wrote some C test code to make sure it wasnt anything I was doing.p  pCode snippetp  precode C style file stream. include ltcstdiogt include ltiostreamgt  int mainint argc, const char  argv[]      stdcoutltltProcesingltltstdendl     stdstring fileURI  UsersmmurphyDesktopTabbedTestFile.txt    float eeg  87658.98765       Create a C style file stream object.

Negative 4928 pI have created a partial that includes searchable attributes and paging to replace the default rails scaffolded index view.  It works great on a single modelcontroller and now strongmy objective is to share this partial in the DRYest way possible with my other controllersstrong.  My idea is that there should be strongema way to specify, from a controller, what view to loademstrong, so that I can load the same view from the index method of all controllers.  I am open to other solutions as long as they are DRY or to suggestions on how to better accomplish my objective in a more rails way.  Below is my current working implementation, which requires me to go through about 13 models and call codesupercode within each index method and to replace the index.html.erb file with the sample from below which results in 13 identical index files.

Negative 4928 pI want to make a website with a blurred Navigation Bar. The Navigation Bar is fixed and changes height when you start scrolling downwards. There are a few Menu Items inside the Navigation Bar, when you click one of the listet Items the Page start scrolling to the selected MenuPoint. I approached this with this function p  precode.fn.scrollView  function       return this.eachfunction           html, body.animate             scrollTop this.offset.top         , 1000       codepre  pNo issues so far, as I said before the height changes when you start scrolling downwards. At the top of the Page the Navigation Bar is 100px height when you scroll 100px down an animation begins and the Navigation Bar shrinks to a size of 50px. Same thing happens when you scroll to the top of the page, as soon you reached 100px the Navigation Bar gains it full height of 100px. Here is the Codep  precodevar headerDown  true scroll  document.scrollTop var headerHeight  .header.height      ifscroll lt 100         ifheaderHeight  100 ampamp headerDown  false             headerDown  true             .header.animate                 height 100px             , 400              var menuAnimation  1002  navbarHeight2             .vcenter.animate                 paddingTop menuAnimation  px             , 400               else          ifheaderHeight  50 ampamp headerDown  true             headerDown  false             .header.animate                 height 50px             , 400              var menuAnimation  502  navbarHeight2  5             .vcenter.animate                 paddingTop menuAnimation  px             , 400                  codepre  pEverything works fine so far. As you cant blur through layers like in iOS 7, I used html2Canvas a hrefhttphtml2canvas.hertzen.com relnofollowhttphtml2canvas.hertzen.coma to make a screenshot from the side and append it to the header. Than I blur this screenshot with CSS Webkit Filter. Last thing to do I tracked the scrolling from the side and set it equal to the blurred Screenshot, so it scrolls with the site and everything behind the Navbar looks like actual side blurred. p  pNow my issue, when I click on one of the Menu Items the site begins to scroll. It works perfectly but as soon the site scrolls and changes height, with the blurred Canvas inside the scroll animation is very choppy and it lags like hell. p  pIn Chrome everything works perfectly fine, but on Safari its lagging. So I started searching for the failure. I think the issue is the scroll animation and the height animation running simultan when something is actually inside the div. I think another problem is that I used overflow hidden in CSS. I read in Blogs an the solution was to use  codewebkittransform translateZ0code p  pBut it doesnt work fine the side is still a little bit laggy and doest track right with rendering on CPU. So I am asking for another solution.p  pIf you need anything more please ask for it Thanks for your help and sorry for my englishp

Negative 4928 pIm a little lost here and looking for some guidance. Im using the ruby awssdk 1.29.1 gem to set up jobs in the elastic transcoder. In my staging and production environments when I call createjob I constantly get a TimeoutError execution expired error. Works fine in development. Each environment has its own transcoder pipeline, s3 bucket for inputoutput, sns topics, and groups with their own policy. Im calling transcoder.createjob via the delayedjob gem.p  pIve looked everywhere I can think to look in AWS and in my logs and cannot figure out what would be causing this. I dont even know where to look next.p  pThe code that triggers the timeout is transcoder.createjob.p  precodedef self.setupawstranscoderid, s3key   unless s3key.blank     transcoder  AWSElasticTranscoderClient.new       region ENV[AETREGION]           transcoder.createjob       pipelineid ENV[AETPIPELINEID],       input          key s3key,         framerate auto,         resolution auto,         aspectratio auto,         interlaced auto,         container auto       ,       output          key s3keyid.mp4,         presetid 1351620000001100070,  System preset Web         composition [                        timespan                duration 001000.000                                 ]               end end   Queue file processing def queueprocessing   Video.delay.setupawstranscoderid, s3key end codepre  pAlso just updated them awssdk gem to 1.44 bc wtf, and it didnt help.p  pIm at a loss.I can provide whatever code or AWS settings necessary to figure this out.p  pUpdate. I can hardcode all of the values to the staging transcoderbucketuser, etc in my dev environment and it will create the appropriate job and transcode the vide and put it in the right bucket. But when I deploy the same hard coded code up to staging and run it from there it times out again. Code is all the same, only difference is the application.yml file and database.yml. I shouldnt even be referencing application.yml though since Im hard coding the accesskeyid and secretaccesskey values.p
Negative 4928 pI have a mysqli insert statement in php that will not insert at all. Neither will it give me any kind of error message from mysqlierror, it just fails.

But trying the following test case seems to reveal a space leakp  precodeparts  replicate 10000000  char x main  hPutLBuilder stdout  mconcat parts codepre  pRunning this code takes a few seconds and consumes around 250MB of memory. Doing the same task with codeBuildercode is far faster and needs only 40KB. The memory profile shows that all the extra space is taken up by instances of codeBuildStepcode and codeBuildercode, which does not happen when using codeBuildercode directly.p  pWhat makes this code so inefficient Why does it not happen when using codeBuildercodep  pstrongEditstrongp  pMichaels answer below, led me to look at how codepartscode is actually evaluated. After playing around some more, I rewrote the test code in the following wayp  precodemakeStuff acc 0  acc makeStuff acc i  makeStuff acc ltgt char x i  1 stuff  makeStuff mempty 10000000  stuffOld  mconcat  replicate 10000000  char x main  hPutLBuilder stdout stuff codepre  pUsing this definition the performance and memory usage for codeBuildercode and codeLBuildercode is exactly the same i.e. horrible . So it looks like the original version is so fast when using codeBuildercode because the compiler can somehow rewrite codemconcat  replicate n  char ccode into something like codeB.lazyByteString  L.replicate n toAscii ccode at compile time, instead of composing 10000000 functions at runtime on the heap. I tried to confirm this by looking at the generated core. I could tell thatp  ul liThe definition for codestuffOldcode is a call to a relatively short function that does something with types in codeData.ByteString.Builder.Internalcode.li liThe definition for codestuffcode is a call to codemakeStuffcode.li liSaid core was not meant to be understood by mere mortals.li ul  pSo I guess this is just the benchmark being a pathological case, and the actual performance problem in my application lies somewhere else.p

Negative 4928 pAs I am new to the laravel 4 after spending some few months in Codeigniter, I went through the lots of tutorials about laravel and one thing I want to be clear is what is the actual difference between Routes and Controller in laravel, because we can create and generate view in both controller and routes too. Will anyone explain me in brief when to use routes and Controller in laravel Because in other Framework we need routes to specify some particular URLs within the apps and Controller were used to do some real tasks but in laravel I didnt get the main concept of Routes except the routing mechanismp

Negative 4928 pI extend the cgi.FieldStorage class in order to have a custome storage basicly to store the uploaded data in a temporary directory defined by my application. I figured out, the file attribute of this class depends on the size of the file to upload. If this one is pretty small, the file content will be stored as StringIO and if too big as a python file object. This behaviour leads to a bug in my application so I would like to make my cgi.FieldStorage only use file and not StringIO. I tryed to overwrite the readlines function so it is only building BytesIO as followingp  precodedef readlinesself     Internal read lines until EOF or outerboundary.     self.file  self.file  BytesIO     if self.binaryfile         self.file  self.file  BytesIO  store data as bytes for files     else         self.file  self.file  StringIO  as strings for other fields     if self.outerboundary         self.readlinestoouterboundary     else         self.readlinestoeof codepre  pbut this is not working, this method cannot be overwriting ... does any one have an idea how to do this p  pthanks for your reply, Jeromep

It says Controller is a process that manages, controls and monitors Crossbar.io nodes and dynamically starts, monitors and stops worker processes, but not quite sure what exactly that means and what the real life benefits are.p  pI had a look at the crossbar examples at a hrefhttpsgithub.comcrossbariocrossbarexamples relnofollowhttpsgithub.comcrossbariocrossbarexamplesa but cant manage to get my head around because all the examples have the Controller part completely empty in the config.json file.p  pI found a small sample at a hrefhttpcrossbar.iodocsManagementAPI relnofollowhttpcrossbar.iodocsManagementAPIa but still cant understand the purpose.p

Negative 4928 pMenu with Submenu testingp  pPlease notice, Ive implemented two horizontal menues with submenu. However, I wish to achieve the effect of the menu shown on the right with the expanding submenu to push down the fixed header. Do I change the css on the ul hover on the right menu to position relative, the following menu items are moved down. However, do I also set the ul fixed or absolute, it doesnt expand the fixed header down and just sits on top with zindex and such. The second menu on the other hand contains the submenu in the element of the top menu and changes the width thereof, instead, I wish ot achieve for the submenu to extend the whole width on hover, while the top menu items stay in place. The second one expands the fixed header as you can see. Any input is appreciated greatly. Trying to get it done without jquery.p

Negative 4928 pI am running a program where stepwise, certain criteria eliminates records from tables.  However, a record could be eliminated after the 7th table or 8th so the way Ive been doing it, merging table 1 with 2, then table 2 with 3, and so on isnt very convenient.  Is there a way I can track an observation with flags  Like say, if A is in table 1 then match  1 else match  0.  And from there, identify which table A was eliminated from in this case Table 3.  I would need to track possibly multiple observations not too many, maybe 5 or 10 at a time though and they may be eliminated at different points one in Table 3, one in Table 8.p  pExamplep  pTable 1p  pPatIDp  pAp  pBp  pCp  pDp  pEp  pFp  pTable 2p  pAp  pBp  pDp  pEp  pFp  pTable 3p  pBp  pDp  pEp  pFp

Negative 4928 pRecently our cluster has seen extreme performance degradation.  We had 3 nodes, 64 GB, 4CPU 2 core each for an index that is 250M records, 60GB large.  Performance was acceptable for months.p  pSince then weve 1. Added a fourth server, same configuration. 2. Split the index into two indexes, query them with an alias 3. Disable paging windows server 2012 4. Added synonym analysis on one fieldp  pOur cluster can now survive for a few hours before its basically useless.  I have to restart elastic on each node to rectify the problem.  We tried bumping each node to 8 cpus 2 cores with little to no gain.p  pOne issue is that EVERY QUERY uses up 100 of the cpu of whatever node it hits.  Every query is facetted on 3 fields, which hasnt changed since our cluster was healthy.  Unfortunately Im not sure if this was an happening before, but certainly it seems like an issue.  We need to be able to respond to more than one request every few seconds obviously.  When multiple requests come in at the same time the performance doesnt seem to get worse for those particular responses.  Again, over time, the performance slows to a crawl the CPU all cores stays maxed out indefinitely.p  pIm using elasticsearch 1.3.4 and the plugin elasticsearchanalysisphonetic 2.3.0 on every box and have been even when our performance wasnt so terrible.p  pAny ideasp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pit seems like the performance issue is due to index aliasing.  When I pointed the site to a single index that ultimately stores about 80 of the data, the CPU wasnt being throttled.  There were still a few 100 spikes, but they were much shorter.  When I pointed it back to the alias which points to two indexes total, I could literally bring the cluster down by refreshing the page a dozen times quickly CPU usage goes to 100 every query and gets stuck there with many in a row.p  pIs there a known issue with elastic search aliases  Am I using the alias incorrectlyp  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pFound the cause in the logs. Paging queries are TERRIBLE.  Is this a known bug in elastic  If I run an empty query then try and view the last page from 100,000,000 e.g. it brings the whole cluster down.  That SINGLE QUERY.  It gets through the first 1.5M results then quits, all the while taking up 100 of the CPU for over a minute.p  pstrongUPDATE 3strong So heres somethings else strange.  Pointing to an old index on dev same size, no aliases and trying to reproduce the paging issue the cluster doesnt get hit immediately.  It has 1 cpu usage for the first 20 seconds after the query.  The query returns with an error before the CPU usage every goes up.  About 2 minutes later, CPU usage spikes to 100 and server basically crashes cant do anything else because CPU is so over taxed.  On the production index this CPU load is instantaneous it happens immediately after a query is madep

I have no need to keep existing users so no need to worry about migrating data. Just need help figuring out why its still using simplememebership p

Negative 4928 pI would like to use SDL 2 in a host application that can spawn several instances of plugins at the same time. A plugin runs in the host process, so codestaticcode variables are shared between the host and all plugins. Each plugin has its own threads and gets a native window from the host, so it should get its own codeSDLWindowcode and codeSDLGLContextcode. Each codeSDLGLContextcode is only used from one thread.p  pIs SDL 2 usable in this scenariop  pFor example, each plugin would call codeSDLInitcode, codeSDLCreateWindowFromcode and codeSDLGLCreateContextcode. Although some internal static parts of SDL are obviously shared between the plugins, they should not know about this and run completely independent from each other.p  pIs that a good approachp

Negative 4928 pstrongShort versionstrong of my questionp  pIn Cucumber tests written for an Angular single page web application, how do I accomplish the tasks usually performed in the given section of a scenario such as setting up test data, defining database record associations, and ensuring a clean database state between tests when testing the fullstack, both the frontend application and its backend The application source code is stored in two separate Git repositories, one for the frontend application and one for the backend. The backend is written in Ruby using the Rails API gem. The challenge in testing this application fullstack comes from the fact that its actually two applications, in contrast with a more traditional Ruby on Rails application not implemented as a single page application.p  pstrongFull versionstrong of my questionp  pIm looking to write a series of Cucumber tests for a web application. The application consists of a frontend single page application written in Angular, and a backend API written using Rails API. The source code for the frontend and the source code for the backend each reside in their own Git repositories, providing a clean separation between the two codebases. Furthermore, the application uses MySQL and Elasticsearch.p  pIve used Cucumber in the past on previous Ruby on Rails projects. These projects were not developed as single page applications. In these projects it was easy to create Ruby objects as test data in Cucumber step definitions. For example, consider the following feature file from a Rails project that was not a single page applicationp  precode featureshomepage.feature Feature Home page    Scenario Viewing applications home page     Given theres a post titled My first with Hello, BDD world content     When I am on the homepage     Then I should see the My first post codepre  pThe steps in this feature file can be implemented with the following step definitionsp  precode featuresstepdefinitionshomepagesteps.rb Giventheres a post titled . with . content do title, content   post  FactoryGirl.createpost, title title, content content end  WhenI am on the homepage do   visit rootpath end  ThenI should see the . post do title   post  Post.findbytitletitle    page.should havecontentpost.titlesummary of the question   page.should havecontentpost.content end codepre  pIn Ruby on Rails projects that were not developed as single page applications, testing tools can be included into the project as Ruby gems. For me, these tools would includep  precodegroup test do   gem shouldamatchers   gem cucumberrails, require false   gem databasecleaner   gem seleniumwebdriver end  group development, test do   gem factorygirlrails end codepre  pAs you can see, this includes Factory Girl, used for setting up Ruby objects as test data and defining database record associations, and Database Cleaner, used to ensure a clean database state between tests. The inclusion of Selenium WebDriver is required for Cucumber scenarios which use JavaScript.p  pThe situation is different in the case of my single page application. As described above, the application is broken into two separate code bases, one for the Angular frontend single page application and the other for the Rails API backend interface.p  pHowever, single page applications such as my project still have the same testing requirements as more traditional Rails applications not built as single page applications. Its necessary to test the application fullstack to ensure each component, both front and backend, work together as expected. There will need to be Cucumber steps defined which create the given preconditions prior to a test, and it will be necessary to ensure a clean database between tests.p  pHow do I test with Cucumber an application such as this, one with two code bases, implemented as a single page application Theres a version of Cucumber available for JavaScript called CucumberJS. However, I dont know how to create fixtures, record associations, and to ensure a clean database between tests using CucumberJS. Theres also a tool for testing JavaScript written with Angular called Protractor. I imagine this tool taking the place of Selenium WebDriver.p

Since a sphere will never have the same structural arrangement of vertices as cubeat least I think so, it is impossible to make transformation. But hey, we all see it in the picture.

Negative 4928 pCurrently I use a classreader to find specific annotated classes throughout my web application. Instead id like to create an index when the application starts so I can scan that for relevant paths instead of using the classreader. Ive semisimplified what the reflection process currently has to do by providing a package path in my web.xml file so the system doesnt have to scan the entire class list, but that approach is causing some organizational problems as the application grows and instead id like to just scan the entire classpath at startup and index the relevant files.p  pWhat is the best approach Should I be programatically building an xml file on startup, storing it within the application and then removing on shutdown Or possibly a static hashmap of sorts Need some directional advice on how to get started. p

Negative 4928 pI have a form that has several divs within it grouping certain input fields together. I want to hide some of those divs and the input fields within those divs when the page initially loads. This is simple to do with the displaynone attribute for css.  Then, I want to show those hidden divs and their input fields when the user clicks on a showhide button. I am using javascript and css only no jquery for this project. p  pI have a basic javascript function that alternately hides displaynone or shows displayblock the divs with the click of a button.  The function works just fine when I use it on a test page where the divs are not part of a form. However, when I try to use this same function with the divs part of i.e. inside the form, it doesnt work. Actually, it appears to work, but then almost instantaneously reverts back to the initial state of the display setting. I have a feeling that the issue resides in the fact that my divs are inside a form, but I cant understand why that would be an issue. What should I do to correct this issue so that the divs within the form can hideshow with the toggle of a button.p  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta charsetUTF8gt lttitlegtUntitled Documentlttitlegt ltstylegt random      width 600px     minheight 50px     backgroundcolorE01418     colorB5F0B9     display block  hideshow      width 600px     minheight 50px     backgroundcolor223FCD     colorF2D595     displayblock  ltstylegt ltheadgt  ltbodygt  ltform idmyform namemyform methodpost actiongt     ltdiv idrandomgt         ltinput typetext idfirstname namefirstname placeholderfirstnamegt         ltinput typetext idlastname namelastname placeholderlastnamegt         ltinput typeemail idemail nameemail placeholderemailgt     ltdivgt      ltdiv idhideshowgt         ltinput typepassword idpassword namepassword placeholderpasswordgt         ltinput typetext idaddress nameaddress placeholderaddressgt         ltinput typetext idphone namephone placeholderphonegt     ltdivgt     ltinput typesubmit idsubmit namesubmit valueUpdategt     ltbutton idtogglehideshowgtHideShowltbuttongt ltformgt  ltscriptgt  var button  document.getElementByIdtogglehideshow   button.onclick  function      var div  document.getElementByIdhideshow     if div.style.display  none          div.style.display  none          else          div.style.display  block        ltscriptgt  ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre  pOne last thing  my button Im using is NOT the submit button for the form.

Negative 4928 pI was attending a project review and the reviewer asked  me show projects unit test cases, I said here it is. Then was asked for negative unit test cases. Negative test cases Does it exists I have never had one in 12 years of experience do youp  pI respect the reviewer as he added lots of value by his other questions but Negative UNIT Test REALLYp  pFirst question came to me was  do we have any unit test case which should fail to be passed I mean its negative so it should fail isnt it Then I started discussing it with peers and searching on internet. I got overwhelming results to conclude but still the question remains, how a Negative Test Case can pass to prove products quality Shouldnt it fail By now, my thought included the QA test cases as well. Lets have some examples 1.  Positive Name field should accept only up to 100 alphabets  Should pass to prove products quality 2.  Negative Name field should not accept more than 100 alphabets   Should pass too to prove products quality 3.  Positive Name field should only accept alphabets  Should pass to prove products quality 4.  Negative Name field should not accept any special characters or numeric values  Should pass too to prove products quality I cant interpret 1 amp 2 and 3 amp 4 differently, Its same for me and all seems positive test cases to mein fact just test cases which should pass neither positive nor negative . More over the outcome should be exactly the same for all to clear the test, i.e.  PassGreen.p  pI actually failed to prove this to my peers and lost all the arguments  but Negative Unit Test Cases Seriously   . Please share your thought and let me know if you wrote any unit test cases  Dev or Test cases QA failing of which made you happy.p
Negative 4928 pIm currently implementing a Services Oriented Architecture in Symfony2, and I would like to have our recommandations about it.p  pI want to know what I need to handle in the Controller, and what I need to handle in the service.p  pAn extreme solution would be to pass the codeRequestcode to the service, and it will implement all the logic mostly Doctrine, as Im developping an API and not a full site with Twig for example, and then send back a codeResponsecodein the controller.p  pThat means I would have to create code like this p  pIn the service p  precodeif null  entity      throw new ExceptionNot found., selfNOTFOUND  codepre  pAnd in the controller p  precodetry      servicegtdoThings  catch Exception e      if egtgetCode  ServiceNOTFOUND          return new ResponseegtgetMessage, 404       codepre  pWith potentially one condition for every exception I need to throw.p  pIs this a good way to go  Am I completly wrong about the implementation p

Negative 4928 pRevisiting Neo4j after a long absence. I have read a lot of articles but still find I have a few questions to get me going again....p  ol liBidirectional relationships I have a connected totype scenario where 2 nodes are connected to each other. In fact, the idea is to model a type of flow. However, the flow in both directions is not always the same. Im uncertain of the best method to use 1 relationship with 2 properties or 2 distinct relationships li ol  pThe former feels like the comfortable choice but then doesnt feel natural in terms of modelling the actual facts  for example what to call the properties because FlowIn and FlowOut wouldnt make sense when looked at from each nodes perspective. I also wonder about the performance of properties versus relationships in this case  these values will need to be updated.p  ol start2 liRepresenting Time Now I want to take a step further and represent the flow between nodes at specific times or, more accurately, between specific times.

Negative 4928 pI have a procedural mesh of a 2D circle attached to a ScreenSpaceCamera UI canvas and I want to render some UI text on top of it.
