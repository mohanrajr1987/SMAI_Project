Positive 22905 pIs there a way to adjust the thickness of the scrollbars of a WebView using the stylesheet used by the whole JavaFX applicationp  pI am a bit confused sincep  ul lion the one hand I read that the scrollbars are not part of the JavaFX UI control and therefore can only be customized by a stylesheet set on the web engine webview.getEngine.setUserStyleSheetLocation.. which means I have to write another CSS trying that the scrollbars look like all other scrollbars in the applicationli liand on the other hand I can see that the scrollbars are obviously correctly customized using the JavaFX CSS except the thickness of the scrollbars and that the vertical scrollbar is always shown even if the loaded page requires no scrollbars at allli ul  pSo where am I wrong and which is the correct way to solve this problemp  pThanks in advancep

Positive 22905 pIm writing an android app to log into a website using credentials provided by the user and then parse the data from the website into a readable format in the app.p  pIve got a WebView that loads the login page URL. Once the URL has finished loading, I use OnPageFinished and WebView.loadUrl to inject some javascript code to fill two text boxes on the site and hit the submit button which sends a post and redirects to the next page.p  pI am then assuming, once the javascript has finished and the new page has loaded that it will call OnPageFinished again This does not seem to be happening and Im wondering if anyone can tell me whyp  pThe way the OnPageFinished function is set up is that I have it checking for boolean flags whenever it is called and an async thread looping and checking the state of said flags in each interation.

Negative 22905 pSuppose I have a database table with two fields, foo and bar.  Neither of them are unique, but each of them are indexed.  However, rather than being indexed together, they each have a separate index.p  pNow suppose I perform a query such as codeSELECT  FROM sometable WHERE foohello AND barworldcode  My table a huge number of rows for which foo is hello and a small number of rows for which bar is world.p  pSo the most efficient thing for the database server to do under the hood is use the bar index to find all fields where bar is world, then return only those rows for which foo is hello.  This is codeOncode where n is the number of rows where bar is world.p  pHowever, I imagine its possible that the process would happen in reverse, where the fo index was used and the results searched.  This would be codeOmcode where m is the number of rows where foo is hello.p  pSo is Oracle smart enough to search efficiently here  What about other databases  Or is there some way I can tell it in my query to search in the proper order  Perhaps by putting codebarworldcode first in the codeWHEREcode clausep

Negative 22905 pUpdatep  pWith iPhone OS 3.0, the whole UIImagePickerController API has changed. This question and answer should be considered 2.2. legacy code.p  phr p  pWhen using the UIImagePickerController and you allow editing of the image.  The iPhone allows the user to resize and pan the image.  However, the max size of an edited image is capped at 320x320.  p  pAs an example, I took an iPhone screenshot and placed it in the photo library, which is a 480x320 png.  When I use a UIImagePickerController to select that image, even if I do NOT scale or pan the image, it is cropped to 320x320 before it is returned from the UIImagePickerController.  However, if I turn editing off, the image is returned the proper 480x320 size.p  pMy theory Very subtly, the iPhone displays 2 nonstandard translucent tool bars that overlay over the image. These toolbars leave an innocuous 320x320 window over the photo.  It appears to me that this window effectively clips the underlying photo.p  pNote The callback also returns an editing dictionary with the original image and the clipping rect, but of course the rect is also max 320x320.p  pAny ideas on how to allow images larger than 320x320 to be scaled and pannedp  pSome codep  precode voidimagePickerControllerUIImagePickerController picker didFinishPickingImageUIImage img editingInfoNSDictionary editInfo           self.myImageView.userInteractionEnabledYES         CGRect imageFrame  myImageView.frame         CGPoint imageCenter  myImageView.center         imageFrame.size  img.size         myImageView.frame  imageFrame         self.myImageView.image  img         myImageView.center  imageCenter          [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedYES]         [self performSelectorselectorhideToolBars withObjectnil afterDelay2.0]      codepre

Negative 22905 pPicture, if you will, a Visual Studio 2008 WPF application with a single window containing a ListBox.  This application contains a method, outlined below, that binds the ListBox to the contents of a database table.p  pThis application also happens to implement a WFC service contract, hosting said WCF service.p  pThe data binding method below is invoked in respose to both a button press on the window, and in response to a method being remotely invoked against the WCF service hosted by the application.p  pWhen invoked by the button press the binding works correctly and the list box reflects the content of the database table.  I can insert some records into the underlying table, hit the button and the contents of the list box are refreshed to reflect the new records.  However, when triggered remotely via the WCF service any changes to the database are not reflected in the list box.  From stepping through the code the data set contains the correct view of the table, but the list box retains the previous view of the table and doesnt reflect the contents of the data set.p  pInitially I thought this sounded like a threading issue, so I tried making use of Dispatcher objects but to no avail.

Negative 22905 pI have an ASP.NET MVC app which uses a jquery ui dialog for file upload. Everything is working fine with loading the dialog with the correct content and displaying the dialog on my click event however my issue is that after I process the action in my controller action method I dont return back to my dialog as I would expect an ajax like call to behave. My dialog is a form whose methodpost. I believe this is the issue. When I post the form I no longer have context to the dialog. If I remove the methodpost from my form tag I get a 404 not found on my controller action. I will say that I have tried various methods to do what I want to accomplish but each method has not worked for one reason or another. Originally I tried the .post method to fire my controller action but found that the Request.Files was not getting set when I tried to process it in my controller action. I also tried using Html.BeginForm instead of the html  however I ran into the same issue of not returning to the dialog. The net result is a blank browser page with the words Success which is the return of my action method. My latest attempt is to use the jquery method .ajaxForm.

The selects require a lot of indexes to keep them functioning well, but it appears the number of indexes is effecting the efficiency of the inserts and updates.p  pQuestion Is there a method for keeping two copies of a database where one is used for the inserts and updates while the second is used for the selects The second copy wouldnt need to be realtime updated, but shouldnt be more than an hour old. Is it possible to do this kind of replication while keeping different indexes on each database copy Perhaps you have other solutionsp

Negative 22905 pI need to create a system oriented around Methods where providers can register for the Methods they handle and consumers can do two things for now  either get Metadata for a method or execute it. Im considering creating a REST style architecture where methods are resources with unique URIs and an interface consisting of two methods  getMetadata and Execute.p  pIll need to have an equivalent of RequestMapping so that the provider that handles specific methods can be located by the central dispatcher. As a result the provider will return either Model or Metadata object.p  pThis looks pretty similar to Spring MVC but I dont want to expose and consume my resourcesmethods over the web and use http as this will incur unnecessary overhead. Instead I want to use it like a standard java API where java methods are called and java objects are transferred. I can do that by writing my own equivalent of RequestMapping and Dispatcher logic but I was wondering if theres a better way to do this with Spring. Any suggestionsp  pThanks Kostadin p

However, the data isnt necessarily uniformly or normally distributed its just very unlikely to be degenerate.li liAn approximate solution would be fine, but I do need to understand emhowem the approximation introduces error to ensure its valid.li liSince the aim is to remove outliers, Im computing two percentiles over the same data at all times e.g. one at 95 and one at 5.li liThe app is in C with bits of heavy lifting in C pseudocode or a preexisting library in either would be fine.li liAn entirely different way of removing outliers would be fine too, as long as its reasonable.li liemstrongUpdateemstrong It seems Im looking for an approximate a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSelectionalgorithmselection algorithma.li ul  pAlthough this is all done in a loop, the data is slightly different every time, so its not easy to reuse a datastructure as was done a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3738349fastalgorithmforrepeatedcalculationofpercentilefor this questiona.p  h1Implemented Solutionh1  pUsing the wikipedia selection algorithm as suggested by Gronim reduced this part of the runtime by about a factor 20.p  pSince I couldnt find a C implementation, heres what I came up with.

Negative 22905 pSo, Ive previously developed an employee scheduling system in php. It was VERY inefficient. When I created a new schedule, I generated a row in a table called schedules and, for every employee affected by that schedule, I generated a row in a table called scheduledays that gave there start and stop time for that specific date.

It was very logical, but it was very slow. p  pYou can imagine how long it takes to load around 15 employees for a week long schedule.

Negative 22905 pI ran into a problem trying to remove a row from a datatable in C.  The problem is that the datatable is built from SQL, so it can have any number of columns and may or may not have a primary key.  So, I cant remove a row based on a value in a certain column or on a primary key.p  pHeres the basic outline of what Im doing p  precodeSet up a new datatable that is an exact copy of the datatable from the SQL table.   newData  data.Copy ...do other things foreach DataRow dr in data.Rows    ...do other things    Check if the row is already in a data copy log.  If so, we dont want it in the new datatable.   if DataCopyLogMaintenance.ContainedInDataCopyLogdr        newData.Rows.Removedr     codepre  pBut, that gives me an error message, The given DataRow is not in the current DataRowCollection.  Which doesnt make any sense, given that newData is a direct copy of data.  Does anyone else have any suggestions  The MSDN site wasnt much help.p  pThanksp

Negative 22905 pI have a problem which appears to a be an invalid memory block that happens during a Boost call to codeBoostruntimeclaparserparsercode. When that global delete is called on that object, C asserts on the memory block as an invalidp  precodedbgdel.cpp52   verify block type  ASSERTEBLOCKTYPEISVALIDpHeadgtnBlockUse codepre  pAn investigation I did revealed that the problem happened because of a global overloading of the newdelete operators. Those overloadings are placed in a separate DLL. I discovered that the problem happens only when that DLL is compiled in RELEASE while the main application is compiled in DEBUG.p  pSo I thought that the ReleaseDebug build flavors might have created a problem like this in BoostCRT when overloading newdelete operators. So I then tried to explicitly call to mallocdbg and freedbg withing the overloading functions even in release mode, but it didnt solve the invalid heap block problem.p  pAny idea what the root cause of the problem is is that situation solvable p  pI should stress that the problem began only when I started to use Boost. Before that CRT never complained about any invalid memory block. So could it be an internal Boost bugp  pThanksp
Negative 22905 pI have a multithreaded script which occasionally freezes when it connects to a server but the server doesnt send anything back. Netstat shows a connected tcp socket.

The problem comes in when there is an error and the entity is invalid. When the controller renders the form after an invalid model the codeModel  nullcode evaluates to false, even though we are editing a post and there is clearly a model. If I render the hidden input field for ID when adding a post, I get an error stating that the ID cant be null.p  pAny help is appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrong I went with OJs answer for this question, however I discovered something that made me feel silly and I wanted to share it just in case anyone was having a similar issue. The page that addsedits blogs does not even need a hidden field for id, ever. The reason is because when I go to add a blog I do a GET to this relative URL codeBlogProjectAdminAddBlogPostcodep  pThis URL does not contain an ID and the action method just renders the page. The page does a POST to the same URL when adding the blog post. The incoming codeBlogPostcode entity is populated by model binding and has a null Id that will be generated by EF during save changes.p  pNow when editing a blog post the URL is codeBlogProjectAdminEditBlogPostIdcode This URL contains the id of the blog post and since the page is posting back to the exact same URL the id goes with the POST to the action method that executes the edit.p  pThe only problem I encountered with this is that the action methods cannot have identical signatures.p  precode[HttpGet] public ViewResult EditBlogPostint Id     [HttpPost] public ViewResult EditBlogPostint Id    codepre  pThe compiler will yell at you if you try to use these two methods above. It is far too convenient that the Id will be posted back when doing a codeHtml.BeginFormcode with no arguments for action or controller. So rather than change the name of the POST method I just modified the arguments to include a codeFormCollectioncode. Like thisp  precode[HttpPost] public ViewResult EditBlogPostint Id, FormCollection formCollection        You can then use formCollection as the IValueProvider for UpdateModel       and TryUpdateModel if you wish. I mean, you might as well use the       argument since youre taking it.  codepre  pThe formCollection variable is filled via model binding with the same content that codeRequest.Formcode would be by default. You dont have to use this collection for codeUpdateModelcode or codeTryUpdateModelcode but I did just so I didnt feel like that collection was pointless since it really was just to make the method signature different from its GET counterpart.p  pThanks for the help guys Let me know if you find a better way to make this work. The only part Im shaky on is taking in an unnecessary variable to make the method signature different.p

Negative 22905 pIs there any performance benefit to using codeconstcode or codereadonlycode fields compared to regular, modifiable fields, when only using private variables.p  pFor examplep  precodepublic class FooBaar       private string foo  something      private const string baar  something more       public void Baaz                access foo, access baar        codepre  pIn the above example you can see there are two fields codefoocode and codebaarcode.

Negative 22905 pI got a problem with a many to many association in my persistence layer. My scenario is the followingp  pA user can has several roles and a role can have several user attached to it. During the tests I encountered a strange behavior. I created role object and several user objects. The role was set to each of the users. After this the users were saved using a DAO. Then one of the user gets loaded to check whether he got the role that was passed to him before saving the user object. Calling codegetRolescode on the user shows that the role was set correctly. p  pTo check whether the inverse direction also works the role object gets loaded from the database using a role DAO. But calling codegetUserscode on the role object just returns an empty set, although it should contain all the users with this role. p  pI double checked the database table but everything seems all right.

Negative 22905 pI am making a topdown shooter that makes extensive use of TMX maps created with the Tiled application.  Within my TMX map, I have a Background layer with floor tiles, which appears beneath my characters CCSprites.p  pI have another layer in the TMX file called Foreground which I would like to appear above my CCSprites, giving the illusion of them walking underneath various objects.p  pI tried using the vertexZ property of the CCNode class to do thisp  precodeCCTMXLayer backgroundLayer  ... CCSprite spriteNode  ... CCTMXLayer foregroundLayer  ...  [backgroundLayer setVertexZ1] [spriteNode setVertexZ2] [foregroundLayer setVertexZ3] codepre  p...but it turns out vertexZ actually alters the nodes emvisualem appearance within the openGL view.  It effectively causes a CCNode to appear larger, or emcloser to the userem when it has a higher vertexZ value.  I dont want that all I want is a sort of layersofanimpossiblythincake effect, without any visual differences between the layers.p  pSo I thought I would try altering the zOrder property of the nodes, like thisp  precode[[backgroundLayer parent] reOrderChildbackgroundLayer z1] [[spriteNode parent] reOrderChildbackgroundLayer z2] [[foregroundLayer parent] reOrderChildbackgroundLayer z3] codepre  pBut I realized theres a fundamental problem with what Im doing here, since my spriteNode is a direct child of the CCScene, but the background and foreground nodes are both children of my CCTMXTiledMap, which emitselfem is a child of the CCScene.  p  pSo Im basically trying to slip a CCSprite between two layers of the map, which, from the emCCScenesem perspective, are really just two parts of the same layer.  p  pIt seems I could create an additional instance of CCTMXTiledMap just to hold the foreground layer, but that also seems like overkill.   My other thought was to create CCSprites to serve the same purpose, but it seems like theres got to be a better way.p

The real query contains several variables and an input screen called Query  Selection Criteria box in Sap b1 permits the user to enter a date. It is this date which will be used to determine the column names dynamically.p  pThis is why I needed such complicated tools as  cols, query, pivot etc.p  pIf I input, say 01.06.11 01 Jun 2011 in the input screen, this date will be passed on to the sql which will determine the names of the column headings as follp  pJun11, Jul11, Aug11 ..... May12.p  pIf I input another date, say 01.09.10 01 Sep 2010, the column headings will change top  pSep10, Oct10, ....

Negative 22905 pThis is more of a theoretical question and i think the best way would be to start from an example. p  pLets say that I have a rating system. Every user can rate any item once and every item can be rated by any user only one time. I want to present some history of every users ratings all the items he rated, the rating, time etc.p  pMy way of solving this would be to have a table like thisp  precoderatingid  userid  itemid  rating  date codepre  pThis table store every rating and some other needed data. In this case, if there are 10k users and 10k items the table would be a very long one and in addition to that I would be needing to use some JOINs to find out the name of the user and the name of the items he rated. So Im guessing that would take a lot of time.p  pAm I on the right path or is there a better solution to my problemp

For demonstration purposes, I have two self describing WCF services, strongUserServicestrong and strongAuthorizationServicestrong. p  pI have an operation strongCreateUserstrong in strongUserServicestrong and strongAssignRolestrong in strongAuthorizationServicestrong.

The idea is that the success of strongUserService.CreateUserstrong operation is tied to both its successful execution and that of strongAuthorizationService.AssignRolestrong to assign a default role so its very important that they both happen within a single transaction. p  pNote strongAuthorizationService.AssignRolestrong is not only called from strongUserService.CreateUserstrong so it always has to perform its own check to confirm that the user exists. p  pTrouble When the strongUserService.CreateUserstrong operation is called, it will initiate a transaction, and when it calls strongAuthorizationService.AssignRolestrong to assign default role, the operation will join the existing transaction and a check if user exists will cause a timeout since the transaction is not complete and the user is not committed. p  pI know one quick and dirty possibly way to address this is to add a boolean parameter to strongAuthorizationService.AssignRolestrong such that I can use it to control whether the check for user existence should be done i.e. bypass check if the user is in the process of being created, but I would like to hear if there are more elegant ways of getting round this timeout scenario.p

Instead of explicitly drawing stippled lines, this is here achieved by using a strongsubsampled depth bufferstrong 160 x 120 since this further achieves   a bandwidth reduction for clearing and populating the depth buffer.

Negative 22905 pWell I have a question, See for example I have some web pages on my website like codeprofile.phpcode , codephotos.phpcode and some morep  pOkay when user logs in he will be redirected to his codeprofile.phpcode but i got a question suppose if user enters this url without logging in like www.somewebsite.comprofile.php and hits enter. The browser will direct him to the profile.php page and the profile.php throws out errors like undefined variables and all because we load the profile.php page according to user input on the homepagep  pSo I want to redirect user to homepage whenever he opens any webpage on mywebsite and send him a message that please login to continue.p  pSo then I thought and I got a solution. I thought to use codesessionstartcode and give some session value on the index page  and in all other pages i would check codeissetcode so if session is set profile.php page executes else it will redirect him to homepage p  pSomething like thisp  pall otherwebpages will have this on the topp  precode    ltphp     sessionstart    ifissetSESSION[unique]          headerLocation www.someexample.com             exit       codepre  pbut let me know is this the way to do or is it a bad way of doing it are there any better solutions in doing so. any help is greatly appreciated.Thanksp

Negative 22905 pIm developing and testing a little straightforward clientserver application using java and scala. p  pThe strongserverstrong is based on codecom.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServercode and allows the upload of files via a basic RESTful interface using POST and PUT operations. The upload operation is restricted using a hrefhttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc2617.txt relnofollowDigest authenticationa which we implemented by ourselves, is tested and works in browsers, curl and codeApache HttpClientcode.p  pThe strongupload clientstrong wraps codeApache HttpClient 4.1.2code and executes PUT operations over http to upload file entities. The contenttype of the file is specified as codeapplicationxmlcode in the header and only a single file is uploaded at a time.p  pWhen uploading files of strongdifferent sizesstrong a strange behaviour could be observedp  ul liFiles with sizes less or equals to 1.076.006 Byte are uploaded strongsuccessfullystrong.li liFiles with sizes greater or equals to 1.122.158 Bytes strongfailstrong with a codejava.net.SocketException Broken pipecode.li ul  pemThe exact critical size is unknown since Ive created files with different sizes manually to approximate the max working sizeemp  pThe reason for the broken pipe is, that strongthe client somehow ignored the codewwwauthenticatecoderesponsestrong uploading files of that size, as is documented by the server logs. Ignore means, that it just send multiple 4 messages containing no authentication header at all. But emsmaller filesem work well and the client sends an authentication request with the proper challengeresponse correctly immediately after the codewwwauthenticatecoderesponse as it should be.p  pstrongThe upload works in curl with files of all sizes, so no problem there.strongp  pSo at this point, one could say There is some bug in your client. Okay, I kind of hope so, but strongIve also tried an opensource java a hrefhttpcode.google.comprestclient relnofollowRESTclientastrong also wrapping apache httpclient and it has emexactlyem the same behaviour p  pWe tried it using this client over the internet and its also the same as described. So right now, I just hope Ive missed to set something important in codeApache HttpClientcode which leads to this erroneous behaviour and the developer of the opensource RESTclient missed it as well... any ideas what it could be would be greatp
Negative 22905 pNeed to keep track of changes done to objects in database. p  pTrivial implementation would be to have mirror table that gets records inserted into it by triggers, either inside database or within application, but that affects performance and over time mirror database gets huge and essentially doubles maintenance time when original table has to be alteredmirror table needs to reflect that change.p  pSince my biggest requirement here is to have minimal effect on database and application performance my current preference is to dump changes into syslogng over udp and store them in plain text files.p  pAfter all changelog is not something that will be accessed frequently so its even ok to have it archived over time. But obviously with such setup actual accessing that data is quite tricky.p  pSo i guess my question is  is there already a system that at least partially suites my needs Perfect fit would be UDPaccessed schemaless appendonly database system with possibility to automatically archive dataor at least minimal amount of configuration needed for doing that or very slow degradation of insert performance.

The control exposes dependency properties because I want to be able to bind to them when I use the control.

The ValidationRule has a emNotBananaBindingem property that stores the dependency property and uses it in the validate method.p  pI know my property names are kinda crappy, sorry.

Negative 22905 pIm new to Kohana and Im trying to build an application using the ORM module. I created my own user module containing stuff like login, account creating etc. The problem however is that I cant seem to create a user model in my own user module extending the ORM one. If I understand kohana correctly I should name my user model ModelUser. The problem is, the ORM model Im trying to extend is also called ModelUser. p  pThe reason Im trying to create my own model is so I can add some extra methods and checks without modifying with the ORM user model.

Negative 22905 pHeres the scenariop  pA UIViewController A is pushed onto the navigation stackbr On viewDidLoad an async GET is called using AFNetworking a singleton AFHTTPClient shared throughout the application to populate various user elements on the view say a UILabel.br The user presses the back button before the request returnsbr Assume other active view controllers may be making requests so you cant cancel all open operationsp  pSo question 1 is, should you track the open requests made by UIViewController A and cancel the outstanding ones when the user leaves that view, or should you let them finish up and ignore them Since AFNetworking uses blocks, the user elements being updated are retained inside the block and therefore wont cause a crash when the successfail block is executed after the view has been popped. However the downside to ignoring them seems to be unnecessary network traffic.p  pQuestion 2 is, where would you execute the code to cancel the operations made by UIViewController A viewDidDisappear doesnt seem right because the user may have gone forward pushed a new view onto the stack instead of back popped the current view, in which case you dont want to cancel the open requests because the user may come back to the current view and it wont load again.

Why cant the framework deliver this as it delivers the BundleContextp  pAnd while Im at it, why does the OSGi spec use the verbose codelogger.logLogService.LOGINFO,...code instead of the quasistandard codelogger.info..., logger.warn..code etc. Is there some specific reason for thatp
Negative 22905 pI am trying to write a feature for our SharePoint farm that lets users tick items in a document library, choose a custom action Print from the ribbon and then print out the documents client side. Most of the documents print fine  .docx, .xlsx, .pdf, as I can use ActiveXObjects with Print methods for each of these types. However, there is no ActiveXObject for Outlook that allows easy printing of .msg files. As a result, the only method I have found for printing .msg files client side through script is by vbsp  precodeTargetFolder  CEmailExport  Set objShell  CreateObjectShell.Application Set objFolder  objShell.NamespaceTargetFolder  Set colItems  objFolder.Items For Each objItem in colItems     objItem.InvokeVerbExPrint Next codepre  pThis works fine in a .vbs file on my local machine, but the minute I try and place it in a .html file for testing in browser, it gives me a Permission Denied error.

Negative 22905 pI am trying to get this route working in my MVC3 application but the action method always gets null parameters.p  pThe general idea is that my route has a compulsory parameter category and an optional parameter city. The probable Request URLs would look like thisp  precode   MapSelectCategoryRestaurants    MapSelectCategoryRestaurantsWashington codepre  pThis route is meant to return JSON data because it will be used as a web service, that contrary to the standard MapCategory action that I defined after this that is for regular  webpage and works fine.p  pSo, my route is defined in Global.asax as followsp  precoderoutes.MapRoute     Map It Controller             MapSvc,   route name             MapSelectCategorycatIDcity,    URL with parameters             new  controller  Map, action  SelectCategory, city UrlParameter.Optional                  .. Here a route for MapCategoryid ..  .. Here a route for MapPlacemarkid .. codepre  pAs far as I know I can omit catID in the route definition because it is automatically bound that being nonoptional, right Tried by defining it but same outcome.p  pLast but not least, my Action in the Controller is defined as thisp  precode public ActionResult SelectCategorystring catID, string city        IEnumerableltModels.Placemarkgt list      if string.IsNullOrEmptycity          list  doThis       else          list  doThat            return Jsonlist   codepre  pNow I placed a breakpoint on the first statement of the action but when I request the URL as stated in the route MapSelectCategoryRestaurants I see that both the category and city parameters are NULL, in this case I expect the category parameter to be Restaurants.p  pstrongSolutionstrong Note Because I dont have 100 points of reputation I would have to wait 6 hours to post the answer and I really got to go so here it is.p  pstrongThanksstrong tsegay who got me in the right direction. All other routes defined in Global.asax had explicit URLs with parameters but the problem was caused because the default route the standard one created in the empty solution template was too greedy for this casep  precode routes.MapRoute     Default,     controlleractionid,     new  controller  Home, action  Index, id  UrlParameter.Optional   codepre  pI moved it at the end of the list of routes in Global.asax and now the problem is gone Thank you very much for getting me in the right direction.p

Negative 22905 pI am trying to set up a web application stack based upon JBoss AS7 for smallscale research prototypes and student projects that meets following requirementsp  ol lipI want to use AJAXrelated scopes such as strongViewScopestrong  or possibly a ViewAccessScope as in MyFaces Orchestra  for my managed beans, in conjunction with PrimeFaces components.pli lipJPAbased persistence should be fairly straightforward, without having to deal with the OpenSessionInView pattern etc.. The main problem I am having with JPA2 is the dreaded strongLazyInitializationExceptionstrong, especially in AJAX calls. I do emnotem require manual control over conversations.pli lipI want to use strongas few dependenciesstrong as possible, thus mostly relying on what is shipped with JBoss AS7.pli ol  pRight now, I have set up a project with the following mostly provided Maven dependenciesp  ul liCDIli lihibernate2.0apili lijbossejbapi3.1specli lijbossjsfapi2.1specli lijbossannotationsapi1.1specli liPrimeFaces 3li ul  pThis looks pretty slim so far. What is missing is support for further JSFspecific scopes, and that I always get a LazyInitializationException when iterating over collections within a JSF page. Right now, my service classes for persistence look like thisp  precodeimport javax.ejb.Stateful import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped  Stateful RequestScoped public class TestEntityService implements Serializable      PersistenceContexttypePersistenceContextType.EXTENDED     private EntityManager entityManager       ... some methods working with the entityManager ...  codepre  pAnd my ResourceFactory beanp  precodepublic class ResourceFactory      Produces PersistenceUnit     private EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory  codepre  pI unsuccessfully tried combinations with codeNamedcode instead of codeStatefulcode, or codeSessionScopedcode instead of codeRequestScopedcode.

Is this a better alternative to Seam Faces As far as I can see, it offers a ViewScope and ViewAccessScope, but nothing with regard to transaction management.pli ol  pIt would be great if someone with more experience in this field could shed some light on this  I am currently a bit confused because there are so many libraries out there dealing with similar issues, albeit most apparently not compatible with each other see e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma7829052herea.

Negative 22905 pOK, so first some things that might be relevantp  pIm using the Clang 3.1 compiler, in C11 mode, with the standard library set to libc.p  pIm trying to familiarize myself with C11, and in so doing I ran across behavior that seems odd. It may be a quirk of Clang or libc but I cant speak C standardese and I have no access to other compilers with C11 support so I cant really check it, and Ive searched the internet and Stack Overflow to the best of my ability without finding anything related...so here we gop  pWhen using sharedptr  uniqueptr to implement RAII for a simple resource, it seems that their behavior differs with respect to null pointers upon deletion. I realize that normally its not necessary to delete a null pointer, but I had expected the behavior to at least match between the two STL smart pointers.p  pFor the specific case, consider the following codep  precode     auto Deleter  []void cout ltlt Its later ltlt endl     sharedptrltvoidgt spDoSomethingLaternullptr, Deleter     uniqueptrltvoid, void void gt upDoSomethingLaternullptr, Deleter     cout ltlt Its now ltlt endl  codepre  pI would have expected one of the following outputs from thisp  pa If both deleters are called even though the pointer is nullp  precodeIts now Its later Its later codepre  pb If neither deleter is called because the pointer is nullp  precodeIts now codepre  pBut I observe neither of these cases. Instead, I observep  precodeIts now Its later codepre  pWhich means one but not the other of the deleters is being called. Upon further investigation, I found that the deleter for sharedptr is called regardless of whether it holds a null value, but uniqueptrs deleter is only called if it does not hold a null value.p  pMy questions  Is this actually the correct behavior as specified by the standard If so, why does the specified behavior differ between the two STL types in this manner If not, is this a bug I should report to libcp

Negative 22905 pIm running into a particular issue when I wanted to implement the code coverage for our project. Our project is being developed using C and the output is libraries dlls.p  pWe, the testers write RUBY which uses WIN32OLE to register the dlls and test the functions in the libraries.p  pNow we wanted to implement Code Coverage for our project. But we do not want to spend time in writing Unit tests for C to see the code coverage since we have already implemented testing in Ruby.p  pSo is there any tool or any way to analyze the code coverage of the DLLs through Rubyp  pThanks, br Vimalp

Negative 22905 pWhat i am trying to do is toggle between different divs. Its kinda hard to explain but ill give it a try.p  hr  pWhen the page loads there would be div that is visible and 4 with displaynone. And there would be a menu. link 1 would show the first div and hide all others. Then when clicking link 2 the div that is visible will hide and div2 would show. When clicking link 3 the div that is visible will hide and div3 would show and so on. Basically only one div shown at a time. p  hr  pI wrote this but it works only when there are 2 divs.p  precodefunction     link.clickfunction        div1, div2.toggle     codepre  pbut this would only show the hidden div and hide the one that is shown.p  pOkay, i did it and found out that it can be done much easier.

Negative 22905 pThe edit before the publish So I kinda pretty much figured it all out on my own only AFTER I had the whole freakin question typed out and neatly arranged. So as not to work for nothing, Im posting this anyways, asking if this is actually right, and asking for any suggestionscomments. Im still not sure about one thing.p  pAlright, so I am a complete noob to computer science. Right now I am learning about assemblylanguage and machine language programming. This is a homework question so please help me understand, dont throw answers in my face. I am trying to write a program that gets the sum of the numbers from 1 to 20 the answer is 210 using branch on condition a loop.p  pThe Mnemonics used are  p  precodeL  for load   A  for Add   St for store   BC for branch on condition   C  for compare CH for channel codepre  pThere are 10 registers to put stuff into.p  pSo basically I have to do 2 things 1 Figure out a way to add up all numbers from 1 to 20 123456789...20  which includes making a loop, AND 2 create a counter so it knows to stop when it gets to twenty. Is this rightp  precodeSTART    L  R1,COUNT          A  R1,ONE          ST R1,COUNT          A  R2,COUNT          C  R1,TWENTY          BC  3,          ST R2,SUM          CH SUM          STOP COUNT    DC F0 ONE      DC F1 TWENTY   DC F20          END START codepre  pAll this is saying Load Register1 with contents of COUNT which to begin with is 0. Add to Register1 contents of ONE which is 1. Store this new number thats in Register1 into COUNT. Add this new number to Register2. Compare contents of COUNT with contents of TWENTY which is 20. Branch repeat if the number inside COUNT is less than or equal to 20 3 is the condition code. Once the counter reaches 20, the condition will be broken and the instruction will go to the next line which is Store the number which is in Register2 which should now be 210 into variable SUM. Then call CHannel to display contents of SUM on IO device. Then STOP.p  pNow... I dont know how to specify to branchreturn back up to the beginning, so it repeats the process until the counter reaches 20. Im also not sure if I should specify COUNT as 0 or not.p  pThanks for anyall help.p

However my JSP pages do not include codelt page sessionfalse gtcode and I am using JSTL tags to display data stored in session and request.

Negative 22905 pI hit a common problem with my scripting lately and decided to throw it into the wild to see how other people deal with this problem.p  pstrongtldrstrong I want to export objects which have a varying number of properties. eg object 1 may have 3 IP address but object 2 has 7 IP addresses.p  pIve evolved to creating a new object with custom properties and then injecting these objects into an array as my method of catching results  happy to hear if there is a better way but this is how I roll. This method works 100 when outputting to the screen as the objects are shown in list format  Ive tried a number of exportoutfile methods to no avail when I want to capture and store the output for reading in something like Excell.p  pThe following is an example of me building an object and storing it the function of the code is not important here  just the results it generatesp  precodeaddpssnapin Quest.ActiveRoles.ADManagement Groups  getqadgroup AmbigousGroupNameHere UserInfo    ForEach  Group in Groups       CurrentGroupMembers  getqadgroupmember Group     writehost Processing group Group     ForEach  GroupMember in CurrentGroupMembers           If  GroupMember.type eq User               counter  1             writehost Processing member GroupMember             UserObject  getqaduser GroupMember  select SamAccountName,FirstName,LastName              objUserInfo  NewObject System.Object             objUserInfo  AddMember MemberType NoteProperty Name SamAccountName Value UserObject.SamAccountName             objUserInfo  AddMember MemberType NoteProperty Name FirstName Value UserObject.FirstName             objUserInfo  AddMember MemberType NoteProperty Name LastName Value UserObject.LastName              GroupMembership  getqadgroup ContainsMember GroupMember  where name like AmbigousGroupNameHere              ForEach  GroupName in GroupMembership                   objUserInfo  AddMember MemberType NoteProperty Name CtxGroupcounter Value GroupName.SamAccountName                 counter                          UserInfo  objUserInfo          else              writehost This is a group  we are ignoring it.                 UserInfo  ExportCsv UsersOutput.csv NoType codepre  pFrom the above  you can see I scale the object property name by 1 for each group. codeCtxGroupcountercode allows me to scale an object for the correct number of groups each user has. Confirmed this works great when outputting to the screen by default. The object is listed and I can see a new property for each group that matches for that user.p  pNow for the problem. When I codeexportcsvcode or codeoutfilecode the file is generated with enough headers based off the first object  so it creates the headings based on the amount of properties the first object has. So lets say the first user has 3 matching groups, it will create heading codeCtxGroup1, CtxGroup2, CtxGroup3code. Great strongNo.strongp  pIf the next user has 5 matching groups  only the first three are included in the output and the additional 2 are discarded as we dont have headings for codeCtxGroup4, CtxGroup5code.p  pHow on earth do other people deal with thisp  pside note I considered creating my first object as a dummy with a massive amount of object and hence headings but well  that is not cool and really makes me feel inefficient.p

Negative 22905 pI want to use Javascripts array.filter to remove items from an array, because the syntax is elegant and readable. However, it seems that filter doesnt modify the original array, it just returns a new array, filtered as you requested. My question is, why doesnt the following work as I expectp  precodescope.clearList  function     this.list  this.list.filterfunction item      return item.checked  true       ...  codepre  pI would expect that after returning the newly filtered array, this.list would now hold just the filtered set. It does not work like this however. this.list ends up containing exactly the same items. Altering the code to save out the filtered array in an intermediate variable shows that it is indeed filtering correctly. p  pIve done a workaround for now, looping through the filtered version and splicing items out of the original list that should be filtered, but this is inelegant. Am I just thinking about it the wrong wayp  hr  pSidenote Im using Angular.js. Im unsure it matters at all, but the list comes from the followingp  precode  ltdiv classlist ngrepeatlist in listsgt     lt ... gt     ltulgt       ltli ngrepeatitem in listgt         ltdivgt           ltlabelgt             ltinput typecheckbox ngmodelitem.checkedgt             item.name           ltlabelgt           lt ... gt         ltdivgt       ltligt     ltulgt     ltbutton classbtn clearselected ngclickclearListgt       Remove Selected     ltbuttongt   ltdivgt codepre  hr  pEdit to add debugging info Ive introduced a temp variable just to see whats going on in the debugger.p  precodevar temp  this.list.filterfunction item    return item.checked  true   this.list  temp codepre  pBefore execution, this.List has 5 items, temp is undefined. After the first line is executed, this.List has 5 items, and temp has 2 items.  After the last line is executed, this.List has 2 items, temp has 2 items.p  pHowever, it seems after this that the UI which is bound to this.list does not update. So something unrelated to filter does seem to be going on.p

Negative 22905 pIn my database there is a table, which has a column of the type text. This column holds a serialized array. This array is read and stored by another application, and I cannot change its format.p  pThe serialized array holds a selection of database names, table names and column names in two different languages.p  pI would like to write a controller, entity, form, etc. in Symfony2 that is able to modify this serialized array.p  pThere is a script that I can use that can provide an array of all possible db names, table names and column names that each serialized array may contain.p  pThe goal is to present a list of check boxes where users can select dbs, tables and columns. Next, they can do a translation of the names.p  pSince all data is so volatile, I am not sure whether this is even possible in Symfony2.p  pAn alternative is to make the following entities  database, table, column  and do it fully OO. And then I could export a selection in a serialized array, to the external application that expects it that way...p  pCan you guys follow my reasoning Am I overlooking a strategy here...p  pAdded The array is a nested array up to the fifth degree. Databases contain tables, which contain columns. And every item has an original name and a translated name.    p

Negative 22905 pSo my goal is to use WinSock and raw sockets in order to listen for all ICMP Time Exceeded packets which are generated by gateways when the TTL of an IP packet reaches 0.p  pMy first approach involved 2 sockets, one being UDP with TTL set to 2 pretty much guaranteed to have TTL reach 0 wireshark confirmed this, and another one being SOCKRAW with IPPROTOICMP.p  pThis approach did not work  I assume the ICMP socket would only return packets matched to sent packets i.e, echo request  echo reply. Pushing this method a little further, I turned on SIORCVALL promiscuous mode  socket receives emeverythingem. Almost true to its word, I started receiving all inbound and outbound packets on that socket, with the exception of ICMP Time Exceeded and possibly others. This is shown by having one thread send a UDP packet with TTL 2 every 5 seconds, however no ICMP packet was returned. To prove that ICMP was in fact showing up at all, I was able to observe the ICMP packets involved in a simple ping from cmd.p  pMy second approach was to put the UDP and ICMP on the same socket. This involves me crafting the IP and UDP header. Wireshark shows the UDP going out, as expected with no issues with the creation of the packet checksum, etc, and also shows the ICMP Time Exceeded packets being returned, however again I cant see any ICMP traffic coming on my socket apart from again, when I test that ICMP is working with a simple ping.p  pSo my question is, how on earth do you get your hands on these packets Ive had a look at a simple tracert program source code, but I couldnt see anything in there that I was doing too differently.p  h2Socket Creation  Settingsh2  precode        SOCKET s          ifs  socketAFINET, SOCKRAW, 0  SOCKETERROR                      cout ltlt socketAFINET, SOCKRAW, 0 failed with error code  ltlt WSAGetLastError ltlt endl             return 1                    sockaddrin source         memsetampsource, 0, sizeofsource         source.sinfamily  AFINET         source.sinport  0         source.sinaddr.Sun.Saddr  inetaddr10.64.0.8          ifbinds, sockaddr ampsource, sizeofsource  SOCKETERROR                      cout ltlt bind failed with error  ltlt WSAGetLastError ltlt endl             return 1                   uint32t optval  1         DWORD bytesReturned          if WSAIoctls, SIORCVALL, ampoptval, sizeofoptval, NULL, 0, ampbytesReturned, NULL, NULL  SOCKETERROR                      cout ltlt WSAIotcl failed with error code  ltlt WSAGetLastError ltlt endl             return 1                   if setsockopts, IPPROTOIP, IPHDRINCL, char ampoptval, sizeofoptval  SOCKETERROR                      cout ltlt Failed to remove IP header.

Negative 22905 pIm rewriting an ancient VB6 program in C .Net Framework 4.0.    It communicates with a piece of industrial equipment on the factory floor.   VB6 used some old COMbased socket software Im using the .Net Socket class.p  pWhen I send a message to the equipment I expect a response back so I know to listen for one then.  But the equipment can also send messages strongasynchronouslystrong without warning say, to indicate a failure or problem. So I strongalwaysstrong have to receive those.     So what Id really like is an event handler that gets called whenever anything comes in from the equipment.p  pThe Socket class seems to use a BeginReceiveEndReceive scheme for receive event handling.   Can I just do a BeginReceive once at the start of my program to define an eventhandler for all incoming messages, or do I have to constantly be doing BeginReceiveEndReceives throughout my programp  pThanks in advance for clarifying the correct way to do this.p

Negative 22905 pthis is a clearer version of a question asked recentlyp  pIm taking over some code to fix some problems, and one of them is baffling me.p  pThe application needs to monitor the input level and display it so that the user can adjust if needed.  The current code works perfectly with most devices.  Metering mode is enabled, and these two lines are called by a timer routine and work except with one devicep  precodeAudioUnitGetParametermMixerUnit, k3DMixerParamPreAveragePower, kAudioUnitScopeInput, 0, amplevels[0] AudioUnitGetParametermMixerUnit, k3DMixerParamPrePeakHoldLevel, kAudioUnitScopeInput, 0, amppeaks[0] codepre  pWhen the selected input device is a Tascam US144MKII, the value is always 120 for both level and peak.  There are a few differences with the Tascam unit, for example, it lists 4 channels and has a safety offset of 0.  However, I dont see how either of those would cause this particular problem.  Right now my guess is that there is something in the USBAudio drivers from Tascam that is doing things differently than expected.p  pVolumes do show up using Audacity, but if Im reading the code correctly, Audacity is using deprecated functions.  Is it possible to run a separate AudioQueue, not to capture the data, but simply so that I can grab the input levelsp  pI appreciate your answersp

Negative 22905 pCode is probably too complex to post here in full, but here is the basic schema I have two codeActivitycode subclasses, each of which hosts a codeListViewcode.  Each codeListViewcode has an adapter of a custom class, which generates codeViewcode instances also of a custom class.  These lists are showing data items that are generated asynchronously in another thread as it needs to know where to send updates to, the data objects it manipulates have codeWeakReferenceltgtcode objects that are set to hold references to the adapters displaying their contents when they are initialised.  When an object in the list of the first activity is selected, I start the second activity with an intent that instructs it to look up the item and display its contents.  I then use the back button to close the second activity and return to the first. For some reason when I run this with codeStrictModecode checking enabled, it always crashes after a few iterations of switching between the two activities, complaining that there are too many instances of one of my codeActivitycode classes.p  pI have arranged for a heap dump to be written just prior to the crash see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15292383androidstrictmodeandheapdumpsAndroid StrictMode and heap dumpsa.  These heap dumps always show that there is 1 instance of each of my two activities on the heap at the time of termination.   First of all, is this not to be expected when I have recently switched between the two, and if that is so, why is codeStrictModecode complaining about this  If it isnt expected, how can I arrange to avoid this  Examining the heap dump, both objects are referenced from the main thread stack, over which I dont seem to have any useful degree of control.  Each also has a reference from codeandroid.app.ActivityThreadActivityClientRecordcode, which I also do not seem to be able to control.p  pSo, basically, any ideas how I avoid this situation  Does this actually represent an activity leak, or is StrictMode just being overly sensitivep

After the line code3 2code I read the two lines. So its like that block ended. But then, line code4 3code came along. This means I have to do the exact same thing I did with the first block.

Negative 22905 pI am currently working on a desktop C WPF application where the goal is to make it look and feel like a coderealcode Windows Store App.p  pI want to add an codeappbarcode that should be shown when the user swipes up from the bottom. To do this in a normal app you just position your finger outside the screen area, and swipe up.  But if I do that in a fullscreen WPF program I dont receive any codeTouchDowncode or codeTouchMovecode events  probably because the finger is already down when entering the actual screen area. I have tried with the Manipulation framework also, but same result here. Even when I hook directly into the message queue using codeWndProccode or other hooks I get no events at all.p  pThe funny thing is that I can see the codetouch cursorcode move around the screen, so at least something in the underlying framework is notified.p  pDoes anyone have an idea how to do thisp  pp.s. It is not an option for me just to use a windows store app instead, because of hardware connectivity issues p

Negative 22905 pI dont know exactly what socket means. A server runs on a specific computer and has a socket that is bound to a specific port number. The server just waits, listening to the socket for a client to make a connection request. When the server accepts the connection, it gets a new socket bound to the same local port and also has its remote endpoint set to the address and port of the client. It needs a new socket so that it can continue to listen to the original socket for connection requests while tending to the needs of the connected client.p  pSo, socket is some class created in memory And for every client connection there is created new instance of this class in memory Inside socket is written the local port and port and IP number of the client which is connected. Can someone explain me more in details the definition of socketp  pThanksp

Negative 22905 pWe are having an issue with a pair of ListView controls in WPF, these controls are linked together to work as a single grid with a frozen column on the right hand side which contains a checkbox. This is so that the left hand section will be scrollable but the right checkbox will always remain on the screen. p  pWe also have a number of datatriggers which are required to set the visual state in the customized listview style. This is used to highlight the background colour of the selected rows we also have a selected item style.p  pWe have chosen to use datatriggers to fire the viusal states, rather than setting the background colour of the row as this doesnt give us the required control over the design.p  pThe issue we are currently experiencing is related to scrolling the ListView when it contains a large number of rows we believe that this is causing the control to redraw the content, however it then does not seem to fire the datatriggers setting the relevant visual states for each row. p  pThe Two

Negative 22905 pWe are implementing an online interface to connect to the ORACLE DB and allow users to do queries online. We came accross of XMLTYPE datatype in oracle and facing difficulties with it. To retrieve the DATA from a table which has XMLTYPE in it, a normal select  from tablename wouldnt work but we need to call that specific column with xmltype.getclobvalcolumnname.  This would be a nice option if we handle queries from backend, but here we are allowing users to do query on their own. In this case users will just do a select  on that table but still I need to be able to fetch the data and display irrespective of whether it has XMLTYPE or not. Is there any way of doing it using native PHP Oracle drivers itself Or do we need to write a plugin which handles this without notifying users that we are applying xmltype.getclobval function in backendp  h2Please help me in this aspect.h2  pThanks, Lalithp

Negative 22905 pIm looking for some advice on how to store arrays and dictionariestype information in an SQL Server 2012 database.

This is a fairly big issue since the database will store hundreds of thousands of these records every day, and it seems much of the data will be this uncompressed XML. p  pSo Im looking for a workaround. I figure I may be able to tabulate this data. For example,  a data dictionary tablep  precode[ID] bigint PK, [OwnerID] bigint, [Name] varchar32, [Value] varchar32 codepre  pAnd an arrayp  precode[OwnerID] bigint PK [Index] int PK [Value] varchar32 codepre  pThis would work, but Im worried about how queryable this method would be  i.e. WHERE ObjectIDs X dictionary properly  Y. I could write a scalar function for this, but I know thatll cause performance issues. p  pIve read up on this particular issue, but the general consensus seems to be use an xml column and dont worry about it, but given the amount of data I need to allow for, I dont think this is an option for me. p  pAny advice or insights would be very much appreciated.p

I dont necessarily have a problem with that, but everytime you traverse the dom and a codetimeoutcode is used to wait for rendering, someone will shout Thats not what angular was designed for.p  p The second method is more angular I guess, but the directive registers codeobservecode on the attributes, and with the possibility of 400 inputs on the page, I dont know if this will affect performance.p  pstrongSo my questionstrong is, is there a better way to gain access to these nested inputs that will both appease the angular gods AND go easy on the browser  Or is one of my methods a better way to go Or should I just give up and do this all in PythonJinja2  p

Negative 22905 pemNote I know there are LOTS of other StackOverflow questions dealing with this topic. Ive read through many of them, as well as many other websites. I still have the following questions.emp  pSo, Im building a REST API for a new product. At this time the API is entirely for private consumption by our websites and phone apps. However, Im thinking it might be smart to design the API so that it can be made public in the future.p  h2Authenticationh2  pWhile Ive looked at OAuth, I think HTTP Basic Authentication over SSL is plenty secure enough for our API. From what I understand HTTP Basic Authentication over SSL is a completely viable way of authenticating a REST API. Its also quite simple, which is appealing for me since Im new to API development.p  h2Authorizationh2  pIf a user logs in to the API using their username and password, they will only be given access to certain parts of the API. Meaning theyll have access to their own content, but not the content of other users. Further, they may be limited to what they can all do.p  pIn addition to the user accounts, I plan to also have other other non user accounts for more global administrative tasks. These accounts could potentially have full access to the API.p  pIs this a good design OR, is it bad to authenticate a user in this way Should I only be authenticating my clients ie. apps this wayp  h2Sessionsh2  pMy big question is, when logging a user into our web app, how do I manage their sessions REST stipulates sending the username and password with each request. Further, REST APIs are stateless, so I cannot manage sessions there. However, I need to track that theyve logged into the web app somehow. They clearly cant possibly login manually for each request.p  pOne approach is, after a user logs in, we save their login credentials email amp password to the PHP session. Then, each subsequent request to the API could use those credentials. However, saving usernames and passwords in a PHP session just feels wrong and very unsafe. But if not done this way, how are people managing sessions when interacting with a REST APIp  pThe phone apps are easier, as you can save the users login credentials into a keychain.p  pCan anyone help with my design questionsp

Negative 22905 pIm building a meteor applications that stores problem messages in a DB. You can ask for a list with the messages but you can also search for messages. There are three search fields Date, Patient ID and Request number. Its possible to search for messages with one or more of the fields. The respons are messages with all completed fields the same. Therefore Ive built the following queryp  precodeTemplate.list.problems  function   var d  Session.getsearchondate  var p  Session.getsearchonpid  var r  Session.getsearchonreq   var andquery  null   if dnull ampamp pnull ampamp rnull andquery  Problem.DateTime RegExpd  if dnull ampamp pnull ampamp rnull andquery  Problem.PIDp  if dnull ampamp pnull ampamp rnull andquery  Problem.Requestr  if dnull ampamp pnull ampamp rnull andquery  and [Problem.DateTime RegExpd, Problem.PIDp, Problem.Requestr]  if dnull ampamp pnull ampamp rnull andquery  and [Problem.DateTime RegExpd, Problem.PIDp]  if dnull ampamp pnull ampamp rnull andquery  and [Problem.PIDp, Problem.Requestr]  if dnull ampamp pnull ampamp rnull andquery  and [Problem.DateTime RegExpd, Problem.Requestr]   return problems.findandquery  codepre  pThis solution works and Im very happy about it. But my question is is there a more efficient way to build the query In this case I have to make an ifstatement for each possible combination of completed fields. There are only three fields thus its possible, but in case of many fields I suppose there must be a better solution.p  pSo my question how can I build a search query with AND condition in a very efficient way, without too many overheadp  pThanks.p

Please let us know for more information regarding my query. Thanksp  pPHT is not part of the input string, but i append it to display that its Phillines time zone. But i get this abbrevations from admin screen where the country,timedifference to UTCGMT and abbrevations of time zone are stored.p  pI would give the details of my requirement. User enters a date of hisher local time zone. This date can be the date in past or current one. For example, user is entering the date 12AUG2013 1710  which is a phillipines date and time Let us say. I want this date to be converted to UTCGMT date and time. How i do it is, I ask admin user to store time difference for each country. when the user enters the date and based on the selected country, i decide it as phillipnes date and time if the user has selected country Phillipines.Then i add or substract that timedifference to get the UTCGMT date. My concern is if user enters the date and time of a past time, then how can we get the UTC time of that date because we can only get the current UTC time. Hope I could give you enough details. I know the code and able to google and all but i need good approach to do this. I just need concept to do it.p

I also have the feeling with this last approach that it is more a hack than a decent approach.p  pSo i hope that someone can tell me what Im doing wrong.p

Negative 22905 pIm using QueryDSL 3.2.4 with Spring Data JPA 1.4.2 serving as my Repository layer. I have a class to take my web form object a simple Bean that Spring binds the search form to and generate the QueryDSL Criteria object for it, which then gets passed to the businessdata layer to run the query.p  pIm trying to figure out the best way to unit test this generation of a Criteria object. Depending on what is being searched for, different combinations of fields will be in the query Basically, the typical search form, where fields can be blank to not constrain based on it, but each nonblank field indicates a search criterion, and some fields may have some additional options such as whether its for exact match, starts with, or contains.p  pTheres a a hrefhttpwww.petrikainulainen.netprogrammingspringframeworkspringdatajpatutorialpartnineconclusions relnofollowSpring Data JPA tutoriala which advocates for the use of QueryDSL over JPA Criteria API, in part because one can unit test QueryDSL just by comparing the .toString. So, thats the way Im leaning toward for now, of making sure that the resulting Criteria objects toString is reasonable for the query Im trying to test, but Im not sure how Id get the expected toString without constructing the desired query ahead of time and seeing what its toString is, so it feels like not a great test, and it feels like its based on the internals of QueryDSL which may be subject to change. I think of toString on most classes as mainly being a debugging aid, not a part of the spec, though if somebody pointed me to a spec on how QueryDSL creates its toString methods and that its part of the way to use andor test usage of the library, I think Id be a lot happier with this approach. Im hoping theres something better.p  pTheres another StackOverflow question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq1483724365839How do I unit test the querydsl query inside the given methoda, but that looks to be about testing entire queries and needing a mock EntityManager. Im hoping to just test the Criteria part, so Im hoping theres a simpler approach than that, where Id need to mock up a Query thats using the Criteria and then a mock EntityManager to use it, and that all looks to me more complicated than what Im trying to do for just unit testing that Im creating a Criteria object correctly.p  pI feel like I cant be the only person trying to test that Im creating the right Criteria. Thanks for any insights you may have into what Im doing wrong or how one can unit test this better.p

Negative 22905 pThis is a slightly updated issue of a previous problem that was solved until IE8 got in the way. p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19940130makescolumnssameheightwithonecolumnhavingnestedboxesMakes columns same height with one column having nested boxesap  pThe aim is to have 2 columns, one simply filled with text while the other contains three coloured boxes of equal height 33.33 that contain a responsive image inside each. These images need to sit centre of their parent boxes. The three boxes then add up to the same height as the text column. The overall size of the container cant be a fixed height unfortunately as the site is responsive and the amount of text may change so I need the height of the two columns to be flexible.p  pThe previous post fixed the column and box height issue with display inline, however I forgot to mention that I needed it also to work in IE8. In IE8 the column containing the coloured boxes doesnt seem to want to go to 100 height of the text column. And now the images also dont want to align center vertically and horizontally in any browser. p  pI have left my attempts to do this out of the code here as it was just messy and achieved nothing. I thought if I showed the SO community the bare bones of it someone might be able to help me out Massive thank you owed to anyone who can help, this problem is driving me insanep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net6sKuN relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net6sKuNap  precodeltdiv classpagewrappergt    ltdiv classcolumntablegt      ltdiv classcolumnrowgt        ltdiv classcolumn columncell columntextgt          ltpgtLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

On this bar I display various information.p  pI have a Raspberry Pi in my network which I configured as a gateway on my notebook. So all the traffic from my notebook passes the raspberry.

For the other one, listening on port em8126em, I have the following rulesp  ol lipIf no emspecialem parameter is set in the request, I redirect the request to a local page with the original requested URI as a parameter. On this page I have an iframe in which I show the originally requested page, using the URI I read out from the parameters. To avoid having an endless loop I add the emspecialem parameter to the link in the iframe. This part works fine. pli lipIf the emspecialem parameter is not set since the page should be display in the iframe, I redirect the request to the originally requested page using modrewrite again. This redirecting seems to cause the problems.pli ol  pSo here is some code of what I am doing I redirect all traffic on port em80em to port em8126em using iptables. em192.168.1.1em is the IP address of my raspberry which I use since I can not redirect to the loopback interface in the emPREROUTINGem phase.

Negative 22905 pThis question is related to an issue I got recently creating a codetextareacode to fit a containing div. The issue itself has now come to a resolution, though Im still interested in an answer to this question How can one get a codetextareacodes sizing or really, most other elements to match that of a codedivcode For a decent example, take a look at my JSFiddle.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netsqW731 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netsqW731ap  pThe first pyramid only defines the width at its outermost. The others shrink their content appropriately based on the amount of padding theyve been given. p  pI understand that the boxsizing borderbox property would be the quickest way to accomplish what Im looking for codewidthcode means the size of the content plus the size of the padding. However, my impression is that borderbox is just meant to be a quickfix for pages that were relying upon what people saw as IE6s broken box model. If contentbox is supposed to be a reliable default, then what is the expected manner in which people should be sizing things like textboxes Is there a separate unit type from codecode that someone could use to essentially give it the codedivcodes default statep  pIm a bit pressed for time at the moment, but hopefully what Ive given outlines the question in enough detail...p

Negative 22905 pI am trying to set up global variables that would be accessible by any of the threads in Django. I know there are endless posts on stackoverflow about this, and everyone says dont do it. I am writing a web application which does some file processing using the a hrefhttpspypi.python.orgpypiacora relnofollowAcoraa Python module.  The Acora module builds a tree of sorts based on some input data strings. The process of building the tree takes some time, so Id like to build the Acora structure at application start up time, so that when files are submitted to be processed, the Acora structures would be ready to go. This would shave 30 seconds from each file to be processed if I could pull this off.p  pIve tried a few methods, but for each request, the data isnt available and I think its because each request is processed in a separate thread, so I need a cross thread or shared memory solution, or I have to find something other than Acora. Also, Acora cant be pickled or serialized as it is a C module and doesnt expose its data to Python. Ive tried Django cache and cPickle, without luck because they use Pickle.  Thoughtsp

Negative 22905 pI am new to Rspec and Factory girl and would like my test to run on a specific database state. I understand I can get Factory girl to create these records, and the objects will be destroyed after the test run, but what happens if I have data in the database.p  pFor example I want my test to run when there are 3 records in the database that I created through Factory Girl. However, I currently already have 1 model record in the database, and I dont want to delete it just for the test. Having that 1 model in there ruins my test.p  pstrongDatabase Contentstrongp  precode[ltLeaderboard id 1, score 500, name Trudygt] codepre  pstrongleaderboardspec.rbstrongp  precoderequire spechelper  describe RomLeaderboard do      describe poll leaderboard do         it should say Successful Run when it returns do             FactoryGirl.createleaderboard, score 400, name Alice             FactoryGirl.createleaderboard, score 300, name Bob             FactoryGirl.createleaderboard, score 200, name John             Leaderboard.highestscorer.name.should  Alice         end     end  end codepre  pNow my test will fail because it will incorrectly assume that Trudy is the highest scorer, since the test have run in an incorrect state.p  pDoes factory girl offer anyway to delete records from the database then rollback this delete Similar to how it creates records in the database and rollsbackp

How can you call F2 and return or find out it contains codeparam37codecodeparam42code and their valuesp  pstrongNOTEstrong Obviously defining coderangescode without defining codedefaultscode would make no sense and be bad coding, which is why I angled the question towards getting the codedefaultscode and not both.p
Negative 22905 pLets say I have a random variable codea1.2400code, and I want to print it with four significant figures, i.e., 1.240. How would I go about that p  precodefprintf0.4g,a  drops rightmost zero fprintf0.3f,a  give too many sig figs if a gt 10 codepre  pUsing codegcode drops the important zeros, and with codefcode I can only specify the number of digits after the decimal, which results in too many significant figures if, say, codea10.04code. Im not too familiar with formatting ,but there has to be a simple method. I havent found it in my searches.p

As a result window closes without asking to save the change.p  pIs there a known workaround or better programming technique The only suggestions that I found are talking about delaying the closing handler by launching a child synchronized thread doing nothing with lower priority.

Will be reporting as a bug soon if it appears that way to anyone else. p  pstrongFINAL TESTINGstrongp  pFrom what I can tell, the code should get the initial settings from its database config file, and then both the Blueprint and Schema should use the updated prefix when the linep  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodeDBconnectionpromotiongtsetTablePrefixthisgtid .  codepre  pis run. Ive worked around it by also running the linep  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodeDBconnectionpromotiongtgetSchemaGrammargtsetTablePrefixthisgtid .  codepre  pWhich seems to fix the issue. This shouldnt be necessary, and I see no reason the code Im using should not have the desired effect. Im considering this a bug, and will report it later today. Ill leave the question open for a bit in case Im missing something, but Ill close it soon. p

Negative 22905 pI am building a live virtual class room and I need to broadcast the teacher camera and microphone to many students. Previously the broadcasting was implemented using red5 via rtmp protocol which is flash. p  pBut the problem is Android phones does not support flash. Also if you take webrtc, it is peer to peer. Due to the requirements of the system, I need a non peer to peer solutionp  pMy question is, is there a way to broadcast webcam and mic to many students at the same time efficiently without using flash If not what other options do I have to achieve this p  pAlso is there a way to broadcast both cam and mic via websockets  Id like to do this as an opensource project since I did not find any good solution for this problem.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 22905 pstrongShort versionstrongp  pI am learning PySide, and most online tutorials use codesupercode to initialize UI elements. Is this important i.e., more scalable, or is it a matter of taste p  pemClarificationem as I make more clear in the detailed version, this is not another generic thread asking when to use codesupercode this has been done before. Rather, given the number of PySide tutorials that use codesupercode instead of codeltclassgt.initcode, I am trying to figure out if using codesupercode is standard in PySide applications If so, is it because the circumstances where codesupercode is called for involving resolving inheritances come up a lot specifically in the use of PySidePyQt Or is it a matter of taste.p  pstrongDetailed versionstrongtldrp  pI am new to Python, and presently learning PySide using Zets tutorial a hrefhttpzetcode.comguipysidetutorialfirstprograms relnofollowhttpzetcode.comguipysidetutorialfirstprogramsa. The second example in the tutorial includesp  precodefrom PySide import QtGui  class ExampleQtGui.QWidget     def initself               superExample, self.init         self.initUI     def initUIself         self.setGeometry300,300,250,150         self.setWindowTitlePySide 101 Window the First         self.show  appQtGui.QApplicationsys.argv exExample sys.exitapp.exec     codepre  pThis works fine, but I have never used codesupercode. Hence, I rewrote the above code, successfully replacing codesupercode with more standard explicit invocation of the parent classp  precodeQtGui.QWidget.initself codepre  pBut as I search the web for PySide tutorials e.g., a hrefhttpqtproject.orgwikiPySideNewbieTutorials relnofollowhttpqtproject.orgwikiPySideNewbieTutorialsa, they emallem include calls to codesupercode. My question is should I use codesupercode for PySide scripting p  pIt seems that codesupercode seems most helpful when you have inheritance diamonds, that it tends to resolve instances of multiple inheritance in a reasonable way. Is codesupercode used a lot with PySide because there is a preponderance of cases of such diamonds that I will confront with more realistic complicated examples em[Edit No see my answer below.]emp  pemWhy am I even askingem Why not just use codesupercode and be done with itp  pI am asking because the book I am using to learn Python Learning Python, by Lutz spends over 20 pages on the topic of codesupercode, explicitly cautioning against using it. He suggests that new Python users go with the more traditional, explicit route before messing with it e.g., see page 832, and pages 10411064 of Learning Python, 5th Edition. He basically paints it as a nonPythonic, arcane, rarely actually needed, new style that you should treat with great caution when just starting out, and thinks it is overused by experienced users.p  pFurther, looking at the source code of two major PySidePyQt based projects Spyder and pyqtgraph, neither uses codesupercode. One Spyder explicitly tells contributors to avoid using it for compatibility reasons a hrefhttpcode.google.compspyderlibwikiNoteForContributors relnofollowhttpcode.google.compspyderlibwikiNoteForContributorsa.p  pNote I link to a closely related post below, but the answer there discusses more generally when you would want to use codesupercode when you have multiple inheritance. My question is whether PySide scripting justifies, or even requires, the use of codesupercode in the long term, or whether it is more Pythonic, and better for compatibility reasons, to explicitly name parent classes Or is it a matter of taste p  pIf it is frowned upon as my beginner book suggests why is it so ubiquitous in PySide tutorials aimed at beginners If it makes any difference, it seems the people writing these tutorials are seasoned Java programmers, or catering to such programmers. I am not. p  pstrongRelated topicsstrongp  pa hrefhttpwww.riverbankcomputing.compipermailpyqt2008January018320.html relnofollowhttpwww.riverbankcomputing.compipermailpyqt2008January018320.htmlap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11597436differentwaysofusinginitforDifferent ways of using init for PyQt4ap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions576169understandingpythonsuperandinitmethodsrq1Understanding Python super and init methodsap

Negative 22905 pI have several enums that serve as type constants. For examplep  precodeenum itemtype    street,   town,   lake,   border, ...  codepre  pThe enum values are used in code to designate object types, and are written out to disk as part of data files. This mostly works well, but there is one drawbackp  pThere is no way to remove an enum member because it is no longer used without changing the integer values of all subsequent members. So any such change would make the code incompatible with existing data files.p  pIs there some good technique for avoiding this problem Maybe some preprocessor trickp  pThe only solution I can think of is to explicitly set all the integer values.

Negative 22905 pI have a perl script that I wrote that gets some image URLs, puts the urls into an input file, and proceeds to run wget with the codeinputfilecode option. This works perfectly... or at least it did as long as the image filenames were unique.p  pI have a new company sending me data and they use a very TROUBLESOME naming scheme.

Thousands of times. Its an hour vs minutes.p  pSo, Im trying to find a method to change the output filenames from wget without it taking so long. The original approach works so well that I dont want to change it too much unless necessary, but i am open to suggestions.p  pAdditionalp  pcodeLWPSimplecode is too simple for this. Yes, it works, but very slowly. It has the same problem as running individual wget commands. Each codegetcode or codegetstorecode call makes the system reconnect to the server. Since the files are so small 60kB on average with so many to process 1851 for this one test file alone that the connection time is considerable.p  pThe filename i will be using can be found with codedd.jpgicode where the filename will simply be code12code to get code2027931230.jpgcode.

The issue here is that fancybox set the height dynamically depending on the page height, but because the height is changed afterwards it doesnt tke the good one. p  phere is how I set my fancybox popupp  precode    height document.height,     width document.width gt maxWidth  maxWidth  document.width, Acts as maxwidth, not possible to set that through CSS.     autoResize true,     closeBtn false,     type iframe,     wrapCSS popup Custom class added to the fancybox div. codepre  pAutoresize is true, but it doesnt change anything in this case.p  pIm looking for a solution here, in the meantime I set a minheight to the div but I dont really like it and it doesnt work properly.p  pAny trick or workaroundp

Negative 22905 pIm working on a web application written in Golang that needs to call a Python programmodule to do some heavy work. Since that is very memoryCPU intensive, it may be on a separate machine. Since Golang and Python cant talk directly, there are 3 ways to achieve thisp  ol liJust execute the python program as an OS process from Go if on same machine or RPCli liWrap Python process in a service and expose it for it to be called from Go may be a simple CRUD like service  A Bottleflask restful serviceli liHave a simple pubsub system in place to achieve this Redis or some MQ system  Adding Redis based caching is on the radar so maybe a good reason to go this way. Not sure.li ol  pThe main thing is that the python process that takes really long to finish must inform the web application that it has finished. The data could either be in a fileDB or returned by the process.p  pWhat could be the simplest way to achieve this in a pubsub like environment p  pstrongUPDATEstrong REST seems like one way but would incur the cost of implementing server side push which may or may not be easily doable with existing micro web frameworks. The pubsub would add an additional layer of complexity for maintainability and a learning curve nevertheless. Im not sure if an RPC like invocation could be achieved across machines.

Negative 22905 pRecently, I have successfully migrated my Qt4 application to Qt5. In fact, the application builds and runs on a development machine using the prebuilt binary Qt5 libraries from the qtopensourcelinuxx645.3.1 distribution.p  pBecause my app needs to be compliant with the LGPL 2.1 license, the linking to Qt5 must be dynamic. So I cannot link to Qt staticallyp  pMy problem is deployment of this application. I just cant come up with a package with all the sharable libraries, which would run across existing Linux distributions.p  pI can tolerate the requirement that the users need to install Qt5 themselves from the qtopensourcelinuxx645.3.1 binary. In fact, this would ensure even stricter compliance with LGPL 2.1. So, I can assume that the compatible Qt5 libraries are installed and available on the host machine although I dont know if I can assume a specific directory for Qt installationp  pHowever, its not clear to me how to package my application to run on the host machine. Any help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 22905 pI am trying to switch my applayout from a LinearLayout to RelativeLayout.

Negative 22905 pI am using Ubuntu 13.04 with Unity.p  pI created an Application Indicator using the AppIndicator class in Python, with a gtk.Menu attached to it. The menu is showing some status information about GIT repositories that I dont want to be updated as long as the menu is not visible. Instead, when the user clicks on the AppIndicator and the menu becomes visible, I would like to get notified and update the information shown.p  pSo far, I could not find a signal emitted by the Menu whenver it pops up. Nor does the AppIndicator have a signal emitted when it gets clicked. In fact, there is already a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7063743pythonappindicatorbindingshowtocheckifthemenuisopenthis questiona but the answers only discuss if AppIndicator has or should have the appropriate signal. But what about the gtk.Menu itselfp  pSo, my question is, how can I get notified that my menu becomes visiblep

Negative 22905 pUsing F in Visual Studio, I find myself having to explicitly annotate types a lot more that I would like, or should have to.  I am aware of some techniques for resolving this, in particular the use of the excellent forward piping operator.   However, in many circumstances I am unable to avoid doing so, and some of them seem just plain wrong.p  pFor example, I have F code like the following snippetp  precode    let b  new pqBoardthis     let b2,steps  b.Solve     if b2.Solved then          let cont  steps gt List.exists fun s  string gt s.IndexOfContradiction gt 0  codepre  pThe third line generates an error message suggesting a type annotation is required for the first of the pair returned from the call to the Solve method on the previous line.  But the second element of the pair a list of strings is fine, and requires no such annotation.  How is it that the type checker can seemingly be certain of the type of the second of the pair, but not of the first when the are returned from a single callp  pChanging the second line as follows fixes the problemp  precodelet b2  pqBoard,steps  b.Solve codepre  pWhy must I explicitly type the first element and not the secondp  pFurthermore, in this case and many others, inferred types are correctly displayed by VS in the tooltips.   I assume that the VS editor is guessing in some sense, but I have yet to see it guess incorrectly  p  pI find it frustrating and disappointing to have to explicitly provide types without any good idea of why they are required.  Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 22905 pI know that it is possible for a function to return multiple values in Python. What I would like to do is return each element in a list as a separate return value. This could be an arbitrary number of elements, depending on user input. I am wondering if there is a pythonic way of doing sop  pFor example, I have a function that will return a pair of items as an array, e.g., it will return code[a, b]code.p  pHowever, depending on the input given, the function may produce multiple pairs, which will result in the function returning code[[a, b], [c, d], [e, f]]code. Instead, I would like it to return code[a, b], [c, d], [e, f]codep  pAs of now, I have implemented a very shoddy function with lots of temporary variables and counts, and am looking for a cleaner suggestion.p  pAppreciate the helpp

Negative 22905 pI am trying to run some Calabash tests on an Android device. If I manually turn the screen before running the tests then everything works. On a Nexus 4 if I turn the screen off and try to run the tests then my first scenario times out waiting for elements to appear.

Negative 22905 pI am developing an application , where the application functionality is exposed through RestFul web services. For validations I am using apachebval implementaion of java validation API JSR303. And to trigger the validations I have written an aspect which is fired whenever the pointcut expression evaluates to the Joint point. If any validation constraint violation is there, I throw ConstraintViolationException explicitly. This work perfectly fine if this exception is to be propogated to the end user. I have written a ControllerAdvice org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice to take care of this. But what if I want to handle the exception in the joint point itself where the contraint violation has actually happened Is there a way to handle the exception thrown by aspect in the joint point I have tried this, but could not accomplish it. p

Negative 22905 pI have created a web form using a custom login control to access a local SQL Server database.

An exception is thrown when trying codeExecuteScalarcode. The exception states that Employees is an invalid object name, so I suspect my problem is the connection string. I retrieved the connection string by viewing the properties of the database in SQL Server 2014 Management Studio, which is where I also created the db.

Negative 22905 pIm aware theres plenty of related questions out there, however I seem to be stuck on something that should be trivial. I have written a java service in Wavemaker, which on the click of a button passes 2 string parameters bound to editors on the front end, into a shell script on our Linux box. I use a process builder in the java service to access to the shell script. The code is as follows.p  precodepackage com.wavemeker import com.wavemaker.runtime.javaservice.JavaServiceSuperClass import com.wavemaker.runtime.service.annotations.ExposeToClient import java.io.IOException import java.io.File    This is a clientfacing service class.  All   public methods will be exposed to the client.  Their return   values and parameters will be passed to the client or taken   from the client, respectively.  This will be a singleton   instance, shared between all requests.     To log, call the superclass method logLOGLEVEL, String or   logLOGLEVEL, String, Exception.   LOGLEVEL is one of FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO and DEBUG to modify your log  level.  For info on these levels, look for tomcatlog4j documentation  ExposeToClient public class xmlGen extends JavaServiceSuperClass      public void readScriptString a, String b throws IOException, InterruptedException                                  final File dir  new Filevarlibtomcat7webappssh               final String shellScript  .masterscript.sh               ProcessBuilder pb  new ProcessBuildershellScript, a, b               pb.directorydir               System.out.printlnExecuting script...               Process proc  pb.start         try                int shellExitStatus  proc.waitFor               ifshellExitStatus  0                                System.out.printlnSuccess                                  System.out.printlnScript has completed successfully.                      catch InterruptedException e                            System.out.printlnShell Script process was interrupted and did not complete.               System.exit1                     end method   end class codepre  pHere the two input parameters a and b are bound to a Wavemaker service variables, so if I enter ten and two on the front screen, these are the parameters I pass to my shell script. They do in fact pass down with no problem, and masterscript.sh executes.The issue im having is that this script calls a few other scripts which in turn invoke lower level java code also reliant on these two string parameters... masterscript.sh looks something like thisp  precodebinbash set e .script1.sh 1 2 .script2.sh 1 2         .       .       . codepre  pand to give an example of one of these scripts script1.sh for example, looks something like thisp  precodebinbash set e FILEPATH1varlibtomcat7webappsdatatest.txt JPATH1varlibtomcat7webappsjavaXMLsrc gt FILEPATH1  empties file contents before writing to it... echo testing params 1 and 2 gt FILEPATH1 cd JPATH1 javac pgQuery.java java classpath postgresql9.31102.jdbc41.jar. pgQuery 1 2 gtgt FILEPATH1 codepre  pSo ultimately I want the output of the java class to be appended to the file test.txt. I find it odd that the echo works fine and outputs the parameters that I entered from Wavemaker to the test file, however the java doesnt seem to be writing anything out. To make things clearer, this piece of java accesses a postgresql database via a prepared statement and gives the results of the query in xml format querytoxml. For completeness, the code is as followsp  precodeimport java.sql.Connection import java.sql.DriverManager import java.sql.ResultSet import java.sql.ResultSetMetaData import java.sql.SQLException import java.sql.Statement import java.sql.  public class pgQuery     Begin Class      JDBC driver name and db URL     static final String JDBCDRIVER  org.postgresql.Driver     static final String DBURL  jdbcpostgresqlpath...

I have tried every combination of double quotes and single quotes around the parameters I can think of but alas, the output of the java code is not being written to this test file from the press of a button on the Wavemaker front end. Im aware this is a bit of a lengthy problem but if anyone had any insight as to why this is not working id be most grateful. Im sure im just overlooking something silly. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 22905 pFor the past few years, Ive developed clientserver software using the Asynchronous Programming Model and sockets. This a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybew39x2a28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowexamplea on MSDN, although overcomplicated with synchronisation mechanisms such as ManualResetEvents, illustrates the concepts you use a codeBeginXXXcode and codeEndXXXcode method pair for the connection and stream operations.p  pThis has the advantage of letting the thread pool assign threads as needed e.g. when data is received rather than having a dedicated thread per connection, which doesnt scale.p  pSomeone recently mentioned that this approach can also be achieved using the asyncawait model introduced in .NET 4.5, thus using Tasks and making the APM unnecessary for this scenario.

Negative 22905 pId like to make modal dialog boxes into a separate state within Angular UI Router. However, I have a case where the modal box canshould appear on top of all states... and I am not sure if this is possible.p  pSo for example, lets say I have codestorecode and codeadmincode as 2 separate toplevel states. Now imagine that I have a modal dialog that is unrelated, like a contact form just as an example that should go on top of each.p  pIf I model this as codecontactcode, the codestorecode or codeadmincode states are obviously forgotten, so the background behind the modal is blank.p  pThe solution might be to have two child states, like codestorecontactcode and codeadmincontactcode, and this preserves the content behind the modal dialog box... however, this approach does not scale for X number of toplevel states.p  pIn a nutshell, how can I say that codecontactcode is a child of all states, regardless of nesting Is this possible Or do I simply have to not use angular UI router in this casep

Negative 22905 pIm working with a driver board which communicates with a PC program via USB  FTDI  TXRX into the microcontroller.  The serial pins are not broken out on the board and I need to talk to the board from another microcontroller like Arduino.  My plan is to just solder directly to the RXTX pins on the microcontroller emdespite the fact that the FTDI is powered on and RXTX of the FTDI will be electrically connected to those pinsem. I will not be transmitting anything via USB.  My assumption is that the FTDI chip will be passive and I can just drive those pins from my Arduino.p  pWill this cause me any issues  Im just concerned if the FTDI passively drives those pins low or high, Ill get smoke if I follow through with my plan.  Perhaps I should put some resistors on my Arduinos RXTX just as a safeguard.p  pIts very possible some of my logic is flawed here.  Thanks in advance for your advicep  pCheersp

So, the user chooses a field from the dropdown and this field should match the value in the textfield.p  pThis actually works, but I try to find a way to validate this. The value is filled in in a textfield, so the form is always valid. But some fields should be integers or dates.p

Negative 22905 pI cant seem to get sqlite3 to not use a TEMP BTREE with a compound index for a query with a LIKE clause and a GROUP BY clause. Seems to only use the index for the WHERE clause.

Negative 22905 pI am using Hosted Messaging and Collaboration v4.0 on Classic ASP. My website can have multiple instances depending on how many users are currently logged in. When ever this HMC4 is being used, it logs everything by creating a text file. There is only 1 text file per day, and all HMC4 instances must access this single file to log the usage.p  pOnce in a while I get the error codeAccess to path  is deniedcode. I have all the permissions set, so the problem is most likely when multiple instances of the application try to write to the log file at the same time.p  pI am lost at how to fix this, modifying the logging method is impossible since HMC4 is a Microsofts product and I dont have source code for it, and handling the exception is not an ideal option since I will have to modify the code 70 times across the website.p  pAny ideas Thank You.p

Negative 22905 pIm starting to learn Polymer 1.0 and I couldnt figure out how to programatically search for insertion points. I realize I could wrap a codeltdivgtcode around the codeltcontentgtcode tag and check if that codeltdivgtcode has children or not, but that requires rendering a codeltdivgtcode for every element, which seems wasteful. Is there a way, with JavaScript, to check if any insertion points have been loaded Ideally, Id have a function codethereAreInsertionPointscode which would determine whether or not the codeltpgtcode tag would render.

Negative 22905 pOk so this is a bit of a weird one, I have a php page that uses the  tag to play background music so everytime the php refreshes the audio reloads which is fine since most of the time its a different audio track. But also for usability i want a mute button, which has to be php because the page reloads. But since its audio so its controlled by javascriptjquery still a bit hazy as to what the difference is.p  pSo my solution in theory is to have the below code audio onoff which takes the bgstate value and writes code according to that.p  h1Audio OnOffh1  precode        ifPOST[bgstate]1                            Mute Music  Play Button                 gt                     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt                 document.readyfunction                  var bgAudio  document.getElementByIdbackgroundaudio                 ifbgAudio                                  bgAudio.volume  0.0                 bgAudio.pause                 bgAudio.currentTime  0                                                        ltscriptgt                 ltphp                       else                                Play Music  Mute Button                 gt                 ltscript typetextjavascriptgt                          document.readyfunction                      var bgAudio  document.getElementByIdbackgroundaudio                     ifbgAudio                                          bgAudio.volume  1.0                     bgAudio.play                                                            ltscriptgt                 ltphp                              gt codepre  h1If Statementh1  precode    ltphp  04                 ifPOST[click]04                                               i  3                         ii  i1                         theSound  storygtentry[i]gtsound                         theSpeaker01  storygtentry[i]gtspeaker                         theSpeaker02  storygtentry[ii]gtspeaker                         theSpeech01  storygtentry[i]gtspeech                         theSpeech02  storygtentry[ii]gtspeech                         opt1  storygtentry[ii]gtopt1                         opt2  storygtentry[ii]gtopt2                         theVideo  storygtentry[i]gtvideo gt  ltdiv idtimelinegt lt top point of ogham gt             ltimg srcimgtimelinetimelinestart.png width31 height31 idtimeline01gtltbrgt lt links gt             ltinput nameclick idtimelineButton typeimage value00 srcimgtimelinetimelineA.png alt onmouseoverjavascriptthis.srcimgtimelinetimelineAon.png onmouseoutjavascriptthis.srcimgtimelinetimelineA.pnggt lt current position gt             ltimg srcimgtimelinetimelineNon.png width31 height31 idtimeline10gtltbrgt lt bottom point of ogham gt             ltimg srcimgtimelinetimelineend.png alttimelinegtltbrgt         ltdivgt  ltphp echo         ltdiv idbannergt                                 lta hrefindex.phpgtltimg srcimgsmalllogo.png altthe cyclegtltagt                                 ltaudio idbackgroundaudio classbackgroundaudio srcaudio.theSound..wav  loop gtltaudiogt                                                          ltdivgt                                 ltdiv iddecisiongt                                 ltdiv idtextContainer classtextContainergt                                 ltdiv idpagesabout classtextContaineraboutgt                                 ltdiv classtextWordstartgt                                 lth2gt.theSpeaker01.lth2gt                                     ltpgt.theSpeech01.ltpgt                                     ltbrgt                                     lta classcontinue href datalinkfirstgtContinueltagt                                 ltdivgt                                 ltdiv classtextWordabout datalinkfirstgt                                 lth2gt.theSpeaker02.lth2gt                                     ltpgt.theSpeech02.ltpgt                                     ltbrgt                                 ltdiv idmenuabout classmenustartgt                                     ltbrgt                                     ltinput typehidden  idbgstate namebgstate value0gt                                     ltbutton typesubmit nameclick idsubmit value06gt.opt1.ltbuttongt                                     ltbutton typesubmit nameclick idsubmit value10gt.opt2.ltbuttongt                                 ltdivgt                                       ltdivgt                             ltdivgt                             ltdivgt                         ltdivgt                          ltvideo autoplay loop posterimg.theVideo..jpg idbgvidgt                             ltsource srcvids.theVideo..webm typevideowebmgt                             ltsource srcvids.theVideo..mp4 typevideomp4gt                         ltvideogt                                                   codepre  pAs you can see right now to test if it worked i have bgstate hardcoded to 0 eg.                                   p  precodeltinput typehidden  idbgstate namebgstate value0gt codepre  pSo im wondering what kind of button i need to set this hidden value to 01 as desired using javascriptjquery I hope this all makes sense to anybody who reads this.

Negative 22905 pI have a question related to the WordPressltJoomla compatibility. Recently I purchased a sophisticated plugin which runs on WordPress only. But my website with all the content and the design is based on Joomla. So Im trying to figure out the means how I could use that WordPress plugin on the Joomla website. As I said before its kind of advanced plugin with many options, so I guess it would be difficult to adapt the code to fit Joomla requirements. So Im thinking about two possible solutionsp  ol lipI could create a WordPress website with the same design that Joomla website has. However this solution requires to change all the Joomla template files, or to build the WordPress theme from scratch. Does anybody know any tutorial which explains how to migrate the template from Joomla to WordPress I basically dont need to move the content, only the design. All the menu links and other stuff would redirect to the parent Joomla site.pli lipThe second solution I think would be to install the WordPress with that plugin on the server and then to create a copy of the Joomla site on the subdomain. Then maybe I can use something like iframe on the Joomla site to show the WordPress plugin running. Is that kind of scenario possible What kind of solution would you suggest As I said before, I will keep my Joomla site anyway, because its already running with tons of data. I just need the functionality of one additional plugin, which sadly runs only on WordPress.pli ol  pThanks for the help.p

Now, I want the web designer to be able to edit this, so when I pull it out of database I use this code afterp  precodepost  htmlentitiespost codepre  pIt is good now that I can insert this into my editorp  precodelttextareagtpostlttextareagt codepre  pBut we have problem because when this guy edit this code, he submit and it go back into the database and now it got HTML entities and has strongamp lt strong instead of lt and strongamp gt strong instead of   it is hard to type this on SA it reencodes itp  precodeampltpampgthellos friendampltpampgt codepre  pSo now its wrong in database, so when I display it again, it show the entities.p  pSo maybe I can run the opposite of stronghtmlentitiesstrong after editing it and readd all the entities, if there is such a thing, but that brings another problemp  pWhat if a web designer is telling other guy Hey man, this is what an html entity is, it is typed like this strongampstrong strongltstrong you should use itp  pThen THAT is going to turn out to get stuck back into NOT being an entity, you see what I mean Is there a solutep

Negative 22905 pIm trying to implement an iterative deepening depth first search algorithm in C.

Negative 22905 pI am working with a legacy C API under which acquiring some resource is expensive and freeing that resource is absolutely critical. I am using C14 and I want to create a class to manage these resources. Here is the basic skeleton of the thing...p  precodeclass Thing  private     void legacy  public     void Operation1...     int Operation2...     string Operation3...  private     Thingvoid legacy          legacylegacy            codepre  pThis is not really the singleton pattern. Nothing is static and there may be many codeThingcode instance, all managing their own legacy resources. Furthermore, this is not merely a smartpointer. The wrapped pointer, codelegacycode is private and all operations are exposed via some public instance functions that hide the legacy API from consumers.p  pThe constructor is private because instances of codeThingcode will be returned from a static factory or emnamedconstructorem that will actually acquire the resource. Here is a cheap imitation of that factory, using codemalloccode as a placeholder for the code that would invoke the legacy API ...p  precodepublic     static Thing Acquire               Do many things to acquire the thing via the legacy API         void legacy  malloc16           Return a constructed thing         return Thinglegacy      codepre  pHere is the destructor which is responsible for freeing the legacy resource, again, codefreecode is just a placeholder ...p  precode    Thing noexcept              if nullptr  legacy                       Do many things to free the thing via the legacy API              BUT do not throw any exceptions             freelegacy             legacy  nullptr               codepre  pNow, I want to ensure that exactly one legacy resource is managed by exactly one instance of codeThingcode. I did not want consumers of the codeThingcode class to pass instances around at will  they must either be owned locally to the class or function, either directly or via codeuniqueptrcode, or wrapped with a codesharedptrcode that can be passed about. To this end, I deleted the assignment operator and copy constructors...p  precodeprivate     ThingThing constamp  delete     void operatorThing constamp  delete codepre  pHowever, this added an additional challenge. Either I had to change my factory method to return a codeuniqueptrltThinggtcode or a codesharedptrltThinggtcode or I had to implement move semantics. I did not want to dictate the pattern under which codeThingcode should be used so I chose to add a moveconstructor and moveassignmentoperator as follows...p  precode    ThingThingampamp old noexcept  legacyold.legacy               Reset the old things state to reflect the move         old.legacy  nullptr           Thingamp operator Thingampamp old noexcept              if ampold  this                      swaplegacy, old.legacy                  return this      codepre  pWith this all done, I could use codeThingcode as a local and move it about...p  precode    Thing one  ThingAcquire     Thing two  moveone codepre  pI could not break the pattern by attempting to commit selfassignmentp  precode    Thing one  ThingAcquire     one  one                       Build error codepre  pI could also make a codeuniqueptrcode to one...p  precode    auto three  makeuniqueltThinggtThingAcquire codepre  pOr a codesharedptrcode ...p  precode    auto three  makesharedltThinggtThingAcquire codepre  pEverything worked as I had expected and my destructor ran at exactly the right moment in all my tests. In fact, the only irritation was that codemakeuniquecode and codemakesharedcode both emactuallyem invoked the moveconstructor  it wasnt optimized away like I had hoped.p  pstrongFirst Questionstrong Have I implemented the emmoveemconstructor and moveassignmentoperator correctly Theyre fairly new to me and this will be the first time I have used one in anger.p  pstrongSecond Questionstrong Please comment on this pattern Is this a good way to wrap legacy resources in a C14 classp  pstrongFinallystrong Should I change anything to make the code better, faster, simpler or more readablep
