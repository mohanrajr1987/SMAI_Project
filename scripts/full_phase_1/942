Positive 942 h2What I want to doh2  pI want to include logging in my tests preferably using System.Diagnostics such that each test case writes to its own log file lets say the format is testcasename.log. strongThe catchstrong is that the logging statements will not be in the test methods themselves, but in a separate class hierarchy, which the different test methods will share. An examplep  pTest classesp  ol liBaseTestClass abstractli liDerivedTestClassFirefox BaseTestClass has test methods like TestAFirefox,TestBFirefoxli liDerivedTestClassChrome BaseTestClass has test methods like TestAChrome, TestBChromeli ol  pOperationClass includes basic actions done by tests and has the logging statements Lets say it has methods OperationA, OperationB, etc. Now different test methods can share these operations. So if OperationA has codeLogger.LogInfoDoing operation Acode, then this message should go to the correct log file according to what test called it. The tests need to be able to run in parallel. I will be using MSTest if it matters.p  h2My current solutionh2  pI made a static Logger class like below   p  precode    public static class Logger              stores tracesource objects against tracesource names same as test method name         entries are added in this by the [TestInitialize] method in BaseTest, as it has access to the calling test method name from TestContext         private static Dictionaryltstring, TraceSourcegt TraceSourceMap  new Dictionaryltstring, TraceSourcegt         automatically determines which log file the message should go to         from the stack trace and test method naming conventions         private static string GetCallingTestName                      StackTrace stackTrace  new StackTrace              StackFrame[] stackFrames  stackTrace.GetFrames              foreach StackFrame stackFrame in stackFrames                              if stackFrame.GetMethod.Name.ToLower.EndsWithfirefox                      stackFrame.GetMethod.Name.ToLower.EndsWithchrome                      stackFrame.GetMethod.Name.ToLower.EndsWithie                                      return stackFrame.GetMethod.Name                                           return null                   private static TraceSource GetTraceSourceObject                      string traceSourceName  GetCallingTestName             TraceSource ts  TraceSourceMap[traceSourceName]             return ts                  public static void LogInfostring logMessage                                            TraceSource ts  GetTraceSourceObject             ts.TraceInformationString.Format[0] 1n, DateTime.Now.TimeOfDay, logMessage               codepre  pThe [TestInitialize] method in BaseTestClass sets up TraceSource with the name as the calling test method name, adds the listener a log file with same name as test name and then adds this object in Logger classs dictionary.p  pThe strongissuestrong is that this design completely depends on test naming. The tests must have firefox, chrome, etc. in the end, and none of the other methods can end like this, because then itll be impossible to tell through stack trace what is a test method or what is an operation unless I impose further pattern in test method naming. On the other hand, this is very less code and will work perfectly even if I run tests in parallel.p  h2Problem Questionh2  pI want to know in what other way I can achieve the same result and if this design is actually that bad. One idea might be to create a logger object in [TestInitialize] of BaseTestClass recall that before this I dont know what the logging file will be as it depends on test name, so cant do this at constructor time and then somehow pass this logger to OperationClass. But then there is only one instance of logger object for the whole test class and this would be a problem if I want to run tests in parallel right As each test method logs in a different place, so each test method needs its own version of logger object. Even for parallely running tests I guess the test class is instantiated only oncep

Positive 942 pOne of our systems is build as a wrapper around a third party customized work flow product that we cannot change.p  pRecently we got a request to capture some user activity data which is persisted nowhere else than in the application logs. These logs files are quite a few spreading across multiple machines so analyzing those logs to extract the required info would be a relatively complex task. p  pCreating some aspects to audit those user actions was considered but was quickly ran out giving the amount of third party code you need to decompile and look at. There will also be security restrictions about activating loadtime weaving on production application servers.p  pMy initial idea was to redirect the log outputs we are interested in to a different file actually files and then analyze those files to process that data. This seems doable but when you start considering things you soon find a lot of issues to deal with when working with files logs rollover, no transactions, keeping a track of what was processed and what not, etc.p  pMy second thought was to implement a custom pattern layout and configure it to be used for the logs I was interested in.

Negative 942 pIm developing for the iPhone, and I have a class codeDataManagercode, that is used to maintain my application data. When the application launchesexits, the data is read fromwritten to disk to create an instance of this class, using the NSKeyedArchiver and Unarchiver classes, since the DataManager adheres to the NSCoding protocol.p  pOne problem Im having is that I need the DataManager to be accessible by many of my other IB classes, so it is defined as an object in IB, and those classes have an outlet to it. The DataManager is being created using the standard init method or maybe initWithCoder, but since IB doesnt have the proper file or NSData from the file to instantiate the object, it has no initial contents.p  pSo, is there any way to tell IB emnotem to instantiate the class automatically This will instead be performed using my application delegate, something likep  pstrongAppDelegate.hstrongp  precodeIBOutlet DataContext context codepre  pstrongAppDelegate.mstrongp  precodecontext  [NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithDatadataLoadedFromFile] codepre  pAs you can see, this presents a problem. Wouldnt the context be instantiated twice, once by InterfaceBuilder, then a second time by my application delegatep  pI would like to prevent maintaining the context as an ivar in the delegate, since that seems to stray from the MVC paradigm, and leans toward the singleton pattern instead. The controller should not be responsible for the data in my mind. It can maintain a reference to it obviously, but should not be responsible for offering it to other classes.p
Negative 942 pIm trying to determine some of the details of how codeHWNDBROADCASTcode works.

The docs say the message will go to all toplevel windows in the system, but clearly that cant be strictly true. For instance, Im sure they wouldnt go to windows in other logon sessions e.g. on a terminal server. My guess is that they are at least limited to the window station of the calling process, but I dont know if they are also limited to the desktop of the calling thread each thread is associated with a single desktop.p  pWorst case I can go write some code to test this empirically, but does anybody happen to know the answer alreadyp

Negative 942 pSo I was writing some code, and I had something like thisp  precodeclass Box      private     float x, y, w, h      public     ...

The Rectangle class has an  operator and a copy constructor. Without getting into why this broke, Im actually more interested in the correct way to return a new object by reference bfor the purpose of sassignings copying to a variable.b Am I just being silly Should it not be done I know I can return a pointer and then dereference on assignment, but Id rather not. Some part of me feels like returning by value would result in redundant copying of the object  does the compiler figure that out and optimize it p  pIt seems like a trivial question. I feel almost embarrassed I dont know this after many years of C coding so hopefully someone can clear this up for me. p

Negative 942 pI have an existing ASP.NET web application that Im converting to MVC 1.0. The site started out with one goal. However, over time our sponsors are asking for more functionality and it is obvious that MVC would be our best route due to the new requirements. Ive dabbled in MVC over the last couple of months and have a pretty good grasp on it all works. The problem that Im faced with now is that the meat of our existing web application makes extensive use of a 3rd party tool that ionlyi works within ASP.NET WebForms. p  pThe solution that Im working on is to have two web applications running on the server. The one application would be our existing WebForms app and is solely used to expose the above mentioned 3rd party tools functionality. The other application will be our main portal that will act as the new site. When the user wishes to interact with the 3rd party tool, I want to be able to load an iFrame on the appropriate Views that links the user to the other application and will then allow them to interact with the WebForms site. Does this sound crazyp  pThe number 1 problem that Im faced with right now is how to configure my solution make the MVC application talk to the WebForms application. Every time I run the solution, a different port number is assigned to the two applications and I cant figure out how to configure my iFrame src properties correctly. Of course, I cant add the WebForms application to my MVC applictions References, so Im stumpedp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated...p
Negative 942 pRecently, I was discussing with another programmer the best way to refactor a huge1000 lines method full of if statements.p  pThe code is written in Java, but I guess this issue could happen in other languages such as C as well.p  pTo solve this problem, he suggested using a chainofresponsibility pattern. He proposed having a base Handler class. Then, Handler1, Handler2, etc. would extend Handler.br  Then, handlers would have a getSuccessor method, which would either return nullif it was the last of the chain or the next Handler of the chain.br  Then, a handleRequestRequest function would either deal with Request, or pass it to the next of the chain and, if none of the previous solutions worked, it would return just null or throw an exception.br  To add a new Handler to the chain, the coder would go to the last element of the chain and tell it there was a new element. To do something, hed just call handleRequest on the first element of the chain.p  pTo solve this problem, I suggested using a different approach.br  Id have a base Handler class as well, with Handler1, Handler2, just like the previous method mentioned.br  However, there would be no getSuccessor method. Instead, Id have a Collection class with a list of handlersa Vector, an ArrayList, or whatever is best in this case.br  The handleRequest function would still exist, but it wouldnt propagate the call to the next handlers. It would just process the request or return null.br  To handle a request, one would usep  precodeforHandler handle  handlers     result  handle.handleRequestrequest     ifresultnull return result  throw new CouldNotParseRequestException just like in the other approach codepre  pOr, to prevent code duplication, a parseRequestrequest method could be added to the collection class. To add a new handler, one would go to the collection constructoror static block, or something equivaleng and simply add the code addHandlernew Handler3.p  pExactly what advantages of chainofresponsibility am I missing with this approach Which method is bestassuming there emisem a best method Why What potential bugs and issues can each design method causep  pFor those who need context, here is what the original code looked likep  precodeifx instanceof Type1  doSomething1  else ifx instanceof Type2  doSomething2  etc. codepre

Negative 942 pIm looking for a way to create some kind of value type hierarchical class structure. I know that enums do not support inheritence since they are value types and are therefore sealed, so Im probably looking for some kind of static class implementation.p  pMy purpose for this is to redefine roles in this ASP.NET application Im working on. Currently the roles are string constants ROLEADMIN, ROLEUSER, etc. and are put in the session and checked throughout the application something like so Person.getRole  ROLEADMIN which is actually a string comparison. Id like to refactor this so that I can have type safety, as well as some kind of polymorphic behavior as desribed below.p  pConsider the following role structurep  precode             user1       Group1              user2 Admin       User3 codepre  pIf a persons role is set to Group1, but a certain element on the page is only visible by user1, then I want the statement Person.getRole  user1 to be true.p  pEDITp  pThinking of the above structure as a tree, I wanted to be able to both define a user in terms of a leaf or a node, and check permissions in terms of a leaf or a node. However that raises a dilemma, does the checking of permissions in terms of a node check if the user belongs to a group group1, or IS a group Admin. I think the problem is that naming the root node of my tree as Admin is misleading, since nodes should be thought of as groups and not as roles themselves. The root node should be something like All, and when it is defined as All would inherit all the leaves of the tree and would therefore belong to all the groups.p

Negative 942 pAfter getting good help previously, I have completed my Minesweeper game. However, there is one problem that I cant figure out. The game itself works fine, however, I have an option for the user to change difficulty setting beginner, intermediate, advanced which is giving me grief. The user selects Game from the JMenuBar and then selects Change Difficulty from the drop down menu. This calls the method selectDifficulty which opens a JOptionMessageBox which uses JRadioButtons to get the user to select one of the 4 options the 4th being Custom  however I have not implemented that as of yet. The dialog box seems to work fine the first time the user changes difficulty mode. However, when the user attempts to change difficulty a 2nd time or more, the game implements the setting and then the dialogue box reappears and promts the user to select the difficulty again. This sometimes repeats twice before going away, and at other times up to 4 or 5 times. I would appreciate any help as I do not know why this is happening.p  pAlso, I would also appreciate some advice on how I could improve how the difficulty settings are change. As it stands, the code removes the JPanel and the minefieldmade of Buttons and re instantiates the buttonsJapanels with the new difficulty setting. Is there a way to make this more efficient p  pThere is a logic class and a GUI glass. Both of the above issues are present in the GUI class.p  precodeprivate void selectDifficulty       group.addb1     group.addb2     group.addb3     group.addb4     b1.setSelectedtrue      Object[]

Negative 942 pI am working on a API to access data stored in a system. The system contains things like people, appointments and procedures associated with those appointments. My application will strictly be readonly. p  pI am using Spring w RowMapper to build objects such a codePersoncode, codeAppointmentcode and codeProcedurecode. I have a DAO for each element. ie codePersonDAO.getByIdcode, codePersonDAO.getByNamecode, ... p  pThe issue comes in that codeAppointmentcode has a reference to a codePersoncode object. An it would be nice in the codePersoncode object to have a reference to that codePersoncodes appointments, but if I begin to load these it becomes a circular reference.p  pSo, I guess my question is the right way to handle this just put the references Ids in the POJOs and then have the business layer just make the right calls to get the information Or is it ok to somehow pass around a reference to the DAO in the actual POJO so that I can lazily load the object objects when referenced But then how do you handle the circular reference When I have a codePersoncode and I lazily load all their appointments, those appointments will also have a Person associated with them. When I load this codePersoncode it could potentially have difference information from the codePersoncode I am loading Appointments for. p  pcodePersoncode object x lazily load  Appointments could lazily load codePersoncode object x.p  pSince codePersoncode could have changed by the time I went to lazily load their appointments. I really need the codePersoncode object in codeAppointmentcode to refer back to the same codePersoncode object.p  pIm getting all caught up on this. I know I could just make it work, but I want to try and find a good solution. I was thinking about using hibernate for this, but thought it was really just overkill. Maybe it isnt.p

Negative 942 pIm attempting to manually load the hexdump of an elf file that I compiled using g into a processor simulation I designed. There are 30 sections to a standard elf file and I am loading all 30 segments with their proper memory location offset taken into account. I then start my program counter at the beginning of the code.textcode section 00400130 but it seems that the program isnt running correctly. I have verified my processor design relatively thoroughly using SPIM as a gold standard. The strange thing is that, if I load an assembly file into SPIM, and then take the disassembled code.textcode and code.datacode sections that are generated by the software, load them into my processors memory, the programs work. This is different from what I want to do because I want top  ul liwrite a c programli licompile it using mipseblinuxg cross compilerli lihex dump all sections into their own fileli liread files and load contents into processor memoryli lirun programli ul  pWhere in the ELF file should I place my program counter initially I have it at the beginning of code.textcode right now. Also, do I only need to include code.textcode and code.datacode for my program to work correctly What am I doing wrong herep

This button is a simple close button so I want it to appear as a square button with an x centred in it.  I have set my padding to zero and set both the HorizontalContentAlign and VerticalContentAlign to Center but the x still appears at the bottom of the button or even truncated should I have my FontSize too big relative to my Height.

Negative 942 pIve nearly completed a tiny winforms app .net 3.5 and the last thing remaining is a printout. The printout is pretty simple. It is printed on an A4 landscape page and consists of three identical columns those are 3 copies of a support ticket. Each column has a bit of fixed text, a logo image, and a few fields from an object. In case a field gets lengthy, Id like the text to wrap over to the next line. But if it gets too lengthy, it should get truncated after the first N lines N will vary among fields, mostly 2.p  pWhat would be the quickest way of doing thisp  pI first thought of using HTML and a browser control, but that creates unwanted headersfooters on the page. Im looking at .NET builtin ReportViewer and the .rdl files, but it seems to me that its pretty clumsy and does not support the wrap logic I mentioned above. Of course I could do it all by hand, but that then again seems like too much work.p  pSince this is just a single simple printout, Id prefer to avoid linking to a huge library or preferably  any library.p

Negative 942 pContext budget tracking app which will have lots of receipts belonging directly to a user. p  pOne of many calculations I will have to keep is a running total of all receipts entered since day 1. As time goes on and receipts increase this will take longer to calculate and perhaps become a bottleneck. And this will be called frequently  every time a user adds a new receipt, edits an old one etc.p  pSo Im wondering how do i avoid this constant summing. Perhaps i should somehow section fence receipts into monthly folders, each folder keeping a track of its subtotal. So if add a new receipt to any month only the sum is calculated for those receipts. Is this the right approach and how should it be implemented Should i be creating a months model herep  pIm not great a db design and was hoping someone maybe able to comment on this approach or offer a cleaner way. p

As a part of the API with the plugins, the hosting application can request a Controlderived object to display on the hosts form.  p  pEssentially the hosting application is a WinForms application that can load assemblies that contain controls.  The hosting application loads the assemblies via Assembly.LoadFile and then asks for a control from each assembly.

If the control is used directly in the host when referenced as a dependency, the timer will tick as expected.p  pIs anyone aware of problems with WinForms Timer not being able to properly hook into the message pump if loaded from an assemblyp

Negative 942 pI guess this is quite a strange question about models transformation.  I am starting from a UML 2.2 model defined with Rhapsody IBMTelelogic and exported in XMI by means of the Rhapsody XMI toolkit. I have succesfully opened it with Topcased The Eclipse based UMLSysml modeling environment. I have therefore applied a QVT transformation to it, aimed at creating a new UML model with a specific subset of entities.  Unfortunately i have not found the right way to retrieve entities description i.e. class and methods description i wrote in Rhapsody. I have noticed these are present in the XMI file as RhapsodyProfileRhpModelElement tags and  descriptionHTML or descriptionRTF attributes. However in the QVT transformation they are neither referrable as stereotypes nor as annotations. It is very important to me not to loose this information.

Negative 942 pIm using Oracle to synchronize events between two nodes of my application server never mind whyif thats the best wayetc. This is a given.  p  pTo do so, Im using an events table that one node the active writes new events to and the other node the passive reads from. The table looks like  p  pEvent UUID UUID  Event ID long    Event Data several columns of different types  p  pThe event ID is a number constantly increasing application controlled, not a sequence that signifies the revision the internal model would be at after applying the event data. The Event UUID has unique constraint. I have a single index on the event ID to facilitate the select SQL  Select ... where EventID  XXX order by EventID where the XXX is the internal revision number of the passive node.

This can go on for an hour or two or even more, then all of the sudden it stops and response time return to its normal level. The AWR reports point toward the truncate statement and a bit toward the insert statements. I suspect something is going on with DBWR  but I cant pinpoint. Note that this performance degradation happens even when the secondary node the one running the SELECT statements is off  so its pure inserttruncate.

Negative 942 pFor a long time now weve been fortunate enough to have the Common Service Locator CSL to resolve services from an unknown source. However, there has never been any containeragnostic solution for registering these services in the first place. Weve always been faced with the problem of having to couple our composition code to a particular IoC container, and furthermore, be committed to using that container throughout our entire application.p  pI feel I may be trying to achieve the impossible here, but does anyone have any ideas on how to achieve a Common Service Registry CSRp  pMy original idea was to use MEF to resolve various codeIContainerIntegratorcodes one class for each container technology, which in turn use MEF to resolve various codeIXXXContainerBindingcodes one interface for each technology. Users could then develop applications around container bindings, and just drop their bindings into the BIN directory to achieve a plugin architecture. If they wanted to use a new container technology, then they would just have to develop a new codeIContainerIntegratorcode class and accompanying codeIXXXContainerBindingcode, which they would then use to write their own bindings. At application startup the CSR aggregates all of the container instances into a single CSL using a codeServiceLocatorAggregatorcode class.p  pI have got this working, but am faced with the following problemsp  ul liAny binding which makes calls to the current incomplete container is unstable, since the previous registrations emmayem be overridden by subsequent bindings. This includes bindings which need to resolve objects to make registration decisions i.e. bind this if that is present.li liTwo bindings may exist which expose the same set of services. However, we want to interlace these registrations. E.g. I want services A and C from binding X, and service B and D from binding Y.li liContainers resolve services from themselves when autowiring dependencies of requested services. E.g. container.BindltThisgt.ToltThatgt will automatically inject the implementation with services resolved from container  not from the aggregated service locator.li ul  pPlease shout at me if Ive completely missed the point here, but isnt this emthe mostem decoupled solution for dependency management Wouldnt it be nice Im about to embark on a big enterprise project with a plugin architecture. I dont want to commit to a particular IoC container.p  pp.s. This question is about containeragnostic composition which supports discovery. Please do not enter a debate on SL vs DI. SL is used in composition, which is why Ive referenced it so much here.p

I learned a lot about ajax and jQuerythanks to stackoverflow during the process and I am quite happy with the final result.p  pThe application works like this The user logs in, and his id is stored in session variable. For example if he clicks on Add button the code looks something like this.p  precodescript.js .getajax.php,actionnew,text text, list selectedList     ,             functionmsg                      add a new task and fade it                         msg.hide.appendTo.listoftasks.fadeIn      codepre  pAnd on the ajax.phpp  blockquote precodeajax.php   ifGET[action]  new     addtaskGET[text], GET[list], SESSION[userid] codepre blockquote  pSo, as it turns out an android app for the web app is in the plans and I was asked if I could make a RESTful web service for it. Can anybody point me in the right direction, is it possible to implement that kind of service with an application coded like this because Ive read somewhere among many other things that it doesnt work with sessionsp  pIt would be great if someone coud at least point me to some basic tutorials, because at this moment this is all very confusing for me.p  pThank you for all your helpp  peditp  pOk thanks everyone, i managed to do what was asked from me with you help and I learned something new, thank you. The problem I have now is authentication. Basically the android app sends request to my api.php page with some variables id, listid etc. Now how do I implement some form of authentication so the api.php would only return results for the authenticated user. Ive talked to the app developer briefly and basically he would send me username and password through http header or something like that. How do I get those values on my api.php page Thank you for all the help p
Negative 942 pIOS 4 lets you modify the locations of mapkit annotations by setting their location property, however this simply jumps it into its new position.p  pOn the other hand, the blue dot that signifies the users current location slides nicely into its new location whenever it is updated. p  pIs there anyway I can do these sorts of animations when I update the location of my annotations I suppose I could divide the longlat points between the 2 locations and update the location at certain incremeents to make it seem like its animating but Im not sure if thats very efficient. p  pAny other ideasp

Negative 942 pI am looking for a way to approximate a volume of fluid moving over a heightmap. The easiest solution I can think of is to approximate it as a large number of nondrawn spheres, of small diameter lt0.1m. I would then place a visible plane representing the surface of the water on top of the spheres, at the locations they came to rest. To my knowledge, no managed physics engines contain a built in fluid simulator, hence the question.p  pImplementation would consist of using a physics engine such as JigLibX, which is capable of simulating the motion of the spheres. To determine the height of the planes, I was thinking of averaging the maximum height of each sphere that is on the top layer of a grouping. p  pI dont expect performance to be great, but would it be approachable for real time If not, could I use this simulation to prebake lines of flow p  pI hope this makes sense, I really want opinionssuggestions as to whether this is feasible, or if there is a better way of approaching this.p  pThanks for any help, Venatu  p  pIf its relevant, my target platform is XNA 4.0, using C.

Negative 942 pI have a big script in Python. I inspired myself in other peoples code so I ended up using the codenumpy.randomcode module for some things for example for creating an array of random numbers taken from a binomial distribution and in other places I use the module coderandom.randomcode.p  pCan someone please tell me the major differences between the two Looking at the doc webpage for each of the two it seems to me that codenumpy.randomcode just has more methods, but I am unclear about how the generation of the random numbers is different.p  pThe reason why I am asking is because I need to seed my main program for debugging purposes. But it doesnt work unless I use the same random number generator in all the modules that I am importing, is this correctp  pAlso, I read here, in another post, a discussion about NOT using codenumpy.random.seedcode, but I didnt really understand why this was such a bad idea. I would really appreciate if someone explain me why this is the case.p

Negative 942 pI am brand new to Ruby and using Windows 7. It is a different environment to what I am normally used to so I am having problems getting a simple project going.p  pAfter reading several tutorials, it appears that JRuby is the simplest way to go on windows which I have done. I am now trying to create a web application from scratch but I am confused about this shell style method of working.p  pI have downloaded sqliste3.def, sqlite3.dll and sqlite3 which I have put in the     Cjruby1.6.4bin directory. However, I am now trying to install sqlite but with no avail. Firstly what I would like to know is which console environment does one use to do this. Is this cmd or the IRB consolep  pWhenever I use cmd the default line is cusersme and I dont know if this is affecting how things should work.p  pWhenever I try to install SQLITE3 I am assuming that i need to go p  precodecusersmegtgem install sqlite3ruby codepre  pHowever I am not getting anywhere and receiving the following errorp  precodeWARNINGJRuby does not support native extensions or the mkmf library very well codepre  pI have heard a lot of good things about Ruby and I am simply trying to build a basic webpage with a contact form but I seem to be running into all sorts of issues with the project installation and simply getting ruby up and running. Are there any tutorials that explain how to start a web project with JRuby and Sqlite3 from scratchp
Negative 942 pIm implementing a tile engine for games using C. Currently the game is divided into maps, each map has a 2D grid of sprites where each represents a tile.p  pI am coding a system where if several maps are adjacents you can walk from one to the other. At startup of the game, all the maps are instancied but are unloaded ie the sprites objects are not in memory. When Im close enough of an adjacent map, the maps sprites are loaded in memory by basically doingp  precodeforint i0 i lt sizeX i      forint j0 j lt sizeY j          Tile tileptr  new Tiletileset, tilesId[i][j], i  offsetX, j  offsetY         tilesMap[i][j]  tileptr       codepre  pAnd they are unloaded by being destroyed the same way when I am too far away from the map.p  pFor a 50x50 map of sprites of 32x32 pixels, it takes me roughly 0.3 secs to load or unload which is done during 1 frame. My question is what is a more efficient way to loadunload maps dynamically, even using a totally different mechanism thanksp  pPS  Im using SFML as a graphic library but Im not sure this changes anythingp
Negative 942 pI need to write a program where during run time, a set of integers of arbitrary size will taken as input. They will be seperated by white space. At the end, a new line is given, showing the end of input. How do I save them into an array of integers so that i can display them later. I think it is a little difficult because the number of values that will be entered is not known during compilationp

Negative 942 pI have this legacy thirdparty COM DLL. I registered it to the registry and added RCW to my .NETC console application.

I.E., installing PGP on their PCs is ideally not the solution or some other complex encryption method.p  pWhat are the thoughts on zip passwords  and emailing this zip file out that contains a txt file with the sensitive information Im thinking about the builtintoCentOS zip  password from command line method  Is this insecure in any way that Im overlooking  Im talking about command line zip  i.e. codezipCmd  usrbinzip P ZIPPASS xxxxcodep  pWhat other options might be good that Im not thinking aboutp  pThanks all.p

Negative 942 pIm pretty new to Python, so Im doing a project in it. Part of it includes a diffusion across a map. Im implementing it by going through and making the current tile equal to .2  the sum of its neighbors n,w,s,e. If I was doing this in C, Id just do a double for loop that loops through an array doing arr[iwidth  j]  arr of j1, j1, ii, i1 the neighbors and have several different arrays that Id do the same thing for different qualities of the map Id be changing. However, Im not sure if this is really the fastest way in Python. Some people I have asked suggest stuff like numPy, but the width probably wont be more than 200 so 4050k elements max and I wasnt sure if the overhead is worth it. I dont really know any builtin functions to do what I want. Any advicep  pedit This will be very dense i.e. every spot is going to have a nontrivial calculationp

So effectively Im writing the app in jQuery Mobile, HTML and CSS.p  pHeres the problem The server is a REST implementation. This means that to create a new entity e.g. user, car, hot babe, the server listens for POST requests. If the server will respond to GET requests by returning existing entities.p  pHow does one get the mobile app to send a POST request from jQuery This sounds simple, but keep in mind that jQuery will change a jsonp datatype request to a GET, even if you specify POST. Also, keep in mind that the server and the app is not on the same domain, so this request is send cross domain, so setting the datatype to json will not work.p  pI have been stuck with this for 4 long hours. I can get it to work in the blink of an eye if I only care about GET requests, but getting a POST on the server has proven to be impossible so far.p  pHere is a simplification of the serverside codep  precode class GatewayService extends Service[Request, Response]     def applyrequest Request        request.method gt Pathrequest.path match         case GET gt Root  car gt           printlnGet car                case POST gt Root  car gt           printlnNew car                case  gt           printlnOther method type               codepre  pAnd heres the jQuery codep  precodefunction serverRequestformId, url      var result       var formData  readFormDataformId     console.logSubmitting formnJSON.stringifyformData      .ajax         typePOST,         url url,         data JSON.stringifyformData,        dataType json,         success functionresponse             alertresponse[message]             console.logReceived response JSON.stringifyresponse             result  response          ,          error functionjqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown              console.log                  The following error occured  jqXHR,                  textStatus, errorThrown                        ,          complete function              Nothing here for now                    return result  codepre  pIf you have any ideas on getting a POST request cross domain with jQuery, please share your secret.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pSo far it appears that you cannot simply access a REST server directly from a mobile app developed on jQuery Mobile.

Negative 942 pA Webview will display links in the content HTML as having blue underlines. So if you have something in the HTML like p  precodelta href...gtblah blahltagt codepre  p... it is clearly visible as a link. p  pThe Webview also allows you to click on phone numbers and addresses even if those are just text in the HTML, not links to launch the Dialer or Maps. p  pHow can one get Webview to display those Linkify, probably links with underlines etc Its easy enough in a TextView since one can get the spans from a TextView and style them, but Webview doesnt expose any way to retrieve that data... at least not that I can see looking through the docs. p

Negative 942 pI have a webapp that uses the html5 navigator.geolocation API. I would like to run it in a UIWebView without using phonegap infrastructure.p  pWhen I load the app from local files in ios, the app prompts the user for permission to use the current location as it should in the ios simulator, using a file url with the path to the file in the simulator. p  pOn real iPhone hardware, the same app does not throw the permission alert or run the code presumably because it does not have permission to run. The real hardware can also run the same app over the wire just fine, but in that case the alert uses the remote hostname, not the local name of the app.p  pIt seems like there should be something I can throw in a property file to configure the app to be able to use navigator.geolocation in a local file, or maybe a way to subclass UIWebView to throw the alert myself, but I cant seem to find any documentation on it.p  pDoes this sound familiar to anyonep

Negative 942 pI am reading a jQuery book and trying to do an example. In the example lightning flashes on the screen, and that part works fine.

Negative 942 pI have to read an html as a text file and I have implemented two different methods as described on SO threads. I clean the html leaving just the body content to put it into DOM with document.writestring with both methods, but it only works if I use Bufferedreader.readLine appending a stringBuilder in a loop. In fact, if I print the stringBuilder.toString in the Logcat window I see that when BufferedReader.readLine is used the stringBuilder is displayed on a single line in the Logcat window, while with InputStreamReader.readcharArray,0,intnumBytes it is displayed multiline I am using a real device. Maybe this can be related and suggest which is the issue. My question is  how have I to clean or process that char Array read by readcharArray,0,intnumBytes to be the same of the stringBuilder appended in the readLine loopp

Negative 942 pIve looked around at answers to questions regarding executing core data saves in the background, but none that Ive found have directly addressed the following scenariop  pIve set up core data so that when my app launches for the first time, core data is populated from a plist and then saved to the persistent store all on a background thread. During this time, the app displays a please wait popup with an animating activity indicator. This seems to work nicely and generally the app will finish the population even if the user hits the home button during the population, pushing the app to the background. However, it is empossibleem that the app could be completely terminated before this population finishes Ive successfully done this by hitting home, doubletapping home, and removing the app from the multitasking tray emreally really fastem. In this scenario, the app quits without saving the data to the store. On the next launch of the app, the app recognizes that the store already exists, so it doesnt populate, thus leaving the user with a completely empty database. So the questions isarep  ul lipIs there a way to completely remove the store on app termination if the population hasnt finished I attempted to do this in codeapplicationWillTerminatecode which didnt seem to properly recognize if the app was in the middle of populating.pli lipOr, is there a better way to recognize when the store requires population E.g., can I determine if the store is empty upon launchpli ul

Negative 942 pWe have files that are hosted on RapidShare which we would like to serve through our own website. Basically, when a user requests codehttpsite.comdownload.phpfilewhatever.txtcode, the script should stream the file from RapidShare to the user.p  pThe only thing Im having trouble getting my head around is how to properly stream it. Id like to use cURL, but Im not sure if I can read the download from RapidShare in chunks and then echo them to the user. The best way Ive thought of so far is to use a combination of fopen, fread, echoing the chunk of the file to the user, flushing, and repeating that process until the entire file is transferred.p  pIm aware of the PHP codereadfilecode function aswell, but would that be the best option Bear in mind that these files can be several GBs in size, and although we have servers with 16GB RAM I want to keep the memory usage as low as possible.p  pThank you for any advice.p

If the login is successful the posted transaction data should be persisted.p  pBut it seems, while I can invoke the session backing bean, store the posted data in a variable inside that bean. When I click login login ok and I reaccess the same bean, the variable where I store the posted data becomes null.p  pSo is session scope not shared between Jersey Rest Servlet and Session scope backing bean in ejbp  pAny other good approachp  pThanks, br czetsuyap

Negative 942 pI am trying to internationalize an iPhone app that was written few years ago and at that time unfortunately internalization was not the priority. As there are lot of nib files I have used ibtool to programmatically generate the nib files for each country. After running the ibtool utility i had to open up the project.pbxproj file and had to insert manual entries for the spanish language. Since i have to update lot of entries i did not choose this route.p  pI wanted to know how can i generate region specific nib file and have the entries reflected in the project.pbxproj file.p  pSecondly, I was unable to use gestrings option as the code doesnt use the NSLocalized method every where the text the is hard coded. while i prefer this option is there a safe mechanism to find out all the strings in the code base that can be internationalizedp  pApologies for the long question. Any recommendations on how should i go about internationalizing the appp  pRegards,p

Negative 942 pFirst I would like to describe the configuration I am want to achieve.p  p1 Remote Windows machine  All required softwareprerequisites for my project is installed, DB configured, etc. 2 Local machines of the developers with Eclipse.p  pPreviously they used RDP connection to the windows machine, to develop, but I am not satisfied with the speed and different lags which happen when the UI goes over network.p  pI want to set up thisp  p1Eclipse is connected to the remote windows machine   works now, I am able to see file system.p  p2Remote code base is added to the workspace on local machine, buildpath of the project is fullfilled with required librarieswhich are also located on the remote filesystemp  p3All the regular tools are working, such as eclemma, it is possible to execute JUnit, etc.p  pI am having several ideas on the top of my head, such as rsync, using subversion, etc, but all of them, require setting up all the prerequisites on the local machines.. I would like to have all the listed stuff to be done remotely.p  pCurrently I have eclipse able to connect to the remote windows machine, but I only can access and edit files, execute shell commands, and see file stucture, this is more like an advanced remote text editor  I would like to be able more features of eclipse and 3rd party plugins..p  pAre there any existing solutions for thatp  hr  pNot having resources is not a bad idea, but, since the development process involves changing sources, to compile those on the remote machine will require to sync them somehow.p  pHere is the breakdown of tasks per location RemoteMachine  compiling, execution of JUnitresults should be displayed in Eclipse in a regular JUnit tab.p  pLocal Machine  Eclipse running, coding, sources should be in sync with remote machine, and in the shell windows of RSE I will be able to execute a complete build processin our project it is different from Eclipses source compilationp  pMain idea is to replace a process where developers work on RDP machines, and to switch to using eclipse locally, without a need to setup all the prerequisite software on local machine.p
Negative 942 pI read that codedynamiccastltTHECLASSgtTHEVARIABLEcode would return 0 if you tried to cast THEVARIABLE to THECLASS assuming that THEVARIABLE is not a class of THECLASS and not a decedent of THECLASS.

Negative 942 pI am fairly new to coding, but have built a few small things. One thing I figured out on my last project was how to run 2 simple commands normally run from a console, but from within a form application instead. Simply, the form had 2 buttons and clicking one caused codeipconfigcode to run and the other codeipconfig allcode. It then posted the ip information coming from the command into another form I created as a message box. That is important because I am trying to do something similar and nothing is working now.p  pI have a form that has a spot for user name and a spot for password. On submit, I want it to essentially run the followingp  precodeNET USE F ALPHACLIENTAPPS userdomainusername password persistentno NET USE O ALPHAUSERS userdomainusername password persistentno NET USE S ALPHACOMPANY userdomainusername password persistentno codepre  pWhere codeusernamecode and codepasswordcode are captured from the form and domain will be our actual domain.p  pUsing similar methods to the aforementioned ipconfig program that is working, this is what I came up with. However, when I click the Submit button, nothing happens, no errors, nor does it actually create the network sharep  precodeprivate void btnSubmitClickobject sender, EventArgs e      string un  txtUsername.Text     string pw  txtPassword.Text      System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo PR  new System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfocmd,  c net use W ALPHACLIENTAPPS useracsdish  un     pw  persistentno     PR.RedirectStandardOutput  true     PR.UseShellExecute  false     PR.CreateNoWindow  true     System.Diagnostics.Process StartPR  new System.Diagnostics.Process     StartPR.StartInfo  PR     StartPR.Start  codepre  pWhat am I missing here, or is there a better way Thanks.p  pMikep

Negative 942 pThe OpenGL standard pages states that the OpenGL is emcallableem from C and C. The API, however, is of course in pure C. As the OpenGL uses for example a lot of enumerations, using enumclasses from C11 could greatly reduce number of errors and make the API more feasible for beginners. It could be seen that lot of the bindings like OpenTK for C are created creating good C API shouldnt be emmuchem harder.p  pI werent able to find anything that was more than an obscure wrapper, hence my questionsp  ol liIs there a wellknown C wrapper using C11 facilities for OpenGL and if not, li liIs something like this planned by anyone wellknown which especially means the Khronosli ol
Negative 942 pI am looking for one file F[i] per cpuarchitecture A[i] x8632, x8664, ARM, Itanium, etc. Each file F[i] would provide enought information about the architecture A[i] registers, instruction set, semantics, etc, so that it would be possible, for any language L, to write a program P that takes any F[i] and generate a compileroptimizer C[i] for the language L to native A[i]. Of course the knowledge of P about A[i] comes from F[i] exclusively.p  pEach F[i] should contain enought information so that for any given compiler C for the language L to native A[i], we can write a P that produces a C[i] performing as well as C. Ideally, F[i] files would be written in a same language DescL able to describe future cpuarchitectures.p  pDoes such files F[i] exist at least for the most common cpuarchitectures  Then where can I download them   Does such an DescL already exist p

Gather all potential primes in a list.     primes  range2, n  1      The first potential prime in the list should be two.     assert primes[0]  2      The last potential prime in the list should be n.     assert primes[1]  n       p will be the index of the current confirmed prime.     p  0      As long as p is within the bounds of the list     while p lt lenprimes          Set the candidate index c to start right after p.         c  p  1          As long as c is within the bounds of the list         while c lt lenprimes              Check if the candidate is divisible by the prime.             ifprimes[c]  primes[p]  0                  If it is, it isnt a prime, and should be removed.                 primes.popc              Move on to the next candidate and redo the process.             c  c  1          The next integer in the list should now be a prime,           since it is not divisible by any of the primes before it.           Thus we can move on to the next prime and redo the process.         p  p  1             The list should now only contain primes, and can thus be returned.     return primes codepre  pIt seems to work fine, although one theres one thing that bothers me.

Negative 942 pIve written a PHP script which performs web scraping from one site and parse input for my website.p  pThe script is driven by cronjob periodically, and everything is hosted in a shared webserver.p  pstrongThe problem isstrong my script terminates several times a day, with no error message and in random location in code each time.p  pThe script is long, performing 2 HTTP Gets and 4 HTTP Posts to other country website, each HTTP request takes 3 seconds to complete it also writes to files and rw tofrom MySql database.p  pIm stuck on it strongafter tryingstrong the following thingsp  p1 Talking with my hosting support IxWebHosting  they just wasted my time, denying their responsibility and advised me to limit the cronjob periodicy to 5 minute rate maximum before it was 3 minutes interval, however it didnt change anything.p  p2 Instead of running from cronjob context, Ive switched to the following method     a. Cronjob calls a loader PHP script every 5 minutes.     b. The loader PHP script calls the real PHP script using HTTP Get and terminates before waiting for an answer.     c. The real PHP script perform its 20 seconds job here is where the program terminates in random location.p  p3 Put some log file timestamp writing in many places along the code in order to see where program terminated each run  this showed me the program terminates everywhere in the code.p  p4 In order to prove its not my code fault Ive performed the following test    a. Cronjob calls another loader PHP script.    b. The PHP script performs HTTP request to a different testingpurpose PHP script and terminates without waiting for response.    c. The 2nd PHP script will perform dummy 20 seconds task sleep for a second and write timestamp into log file for 20 times.p  pResult the test succeeded the 2nd program didnt fail... which means it has something to do with my code and the webserver Im running at  however since it fails everytime in different place and only 10 times a day from 288 times it runs a day then I cant tell where it is and no error message of PHP.p  pThanks in advance, sorry for long description  Ill be happy to provide more details upon request.p
Negative 942 pI am new to iOS development and have been trying to find a way to lock a UISearchBar to the top of a TableView. When I add one using the Storyboard, it scrolls with the table. I need it to be fixed at the top so that when a search term is input, it retrieves some data and displays them in the table cells.p  pI have researched this for hours and although there appears to be many questions and answers on this topic, I cant find one that works for me. I tried adding a TableView and a cell to the bottom part of a UIViewController and a View with a UISearchbar at the top.

Negative 942 pI think I either have a a misunderstanding of the way FreeRTOS taskGetTickCount function works or b something not quite right with our port.p  pI have some debugging where Im showing the output of xTaskGetCount. Any time Ive done a vTaskDelayUntil, it seems its updated and is current. But if I do a spinwait, waiting for it to increment, it never will. I emthoughtem the interrupt fired ever tick and incremented that value. But Im only running one task at the moment, so perhaps it is smart enough to never check for a reshedule and the tickCount never gets updated Anyone who can set me straight on how the FreeRTOS tick count works, Id be much obliged.p  pEDIT A sample fragmentp  precodevoid someTaskvoid        portTickType now  xTaskGetTickCount     for  xTaskGetTickCount  now lt 25               debugu, xTaskGetTickCount        codepre  pThis will spin forever, long past the 25 ms implied when tick  1 ms. The output will just continually list the same value over and and over and over. IF I add a vTaskDelay to the bottom of the loop though, it will increment healthily, and drop out eventually.p

Negative 942 pI am in the begining of making a simple website using ASP.NET MVC4 CodeFirst Approach. The web site is built around users who are able to register, make posts etc. The existing codeUserProfilecode class was modified for the accommodation other fields ex FirstName, LastName etc.p  pWhen I ran the website I got a similar errorp  precodeInvalid column name FirstName. Invalid column name LastName. Invalid column name Phone. codepre  pI red that this is because the Database is not updated as the model is updated. So I set the following on the codeApplicationStartcode in codeGlobal.asaxcode with the intention of droppnng the database always at least until I get the hang of it. p  precodeprotected void ApplicationStart              Database.SetInitializernew DropCreateDatabaseAlwaysltUsersContextgt         Other default generated stuff below...      codepre  pI also tryed the codeDropCreateDatabaseIfModelChangescode, but both methods didnt drop the database.p  pIsnt this possible Why is it Am I doing some thing wrongp  pI believe it would be possible to store the info in a different table and link it to this, but I prefer to keep it in one table.p  pAlso is it a bad idea to add codeUserProfilescode to the websites context lets say codeDatabaseContextcode which has other entities like Posts, Comments etc and change the codeAccountsControllercode to use codeDatabaseContextcode instead of codeUsersContextcodep  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 942 pDoes anyone know of a scripting language thats included with most platforms say MacWindowsLinux  I havent been able to find one.  So far javascript in web browsers or compiled java are about it.  Jython comes close.p  pMy goal is to be able to download a file from the web or portable storage and just run it, without having to install something first, or have special user permissions, or edit it, or rename it, or give it executable privilages.  It would give you access to generally accepted metaphors in computing input, output, persistent storage, time, spawning tasks, sockets, fixed and floating point math, unicode, etc.  Ideally it would abstract away minutia like line endings, endianness, and yielding for other processes.p  pI dont want to get into why having a universal languagevirtual machine is important, or at the very least, useful.  I feel that we are missing a middleware above the operating system level, something like POSIX but less esoteric, and without it, we all are forced to spend a disproportionate amount of time reinventing the wheel or writing special cases.  For me, availability and a complete feature set are more important than speed which could come later.p  pThanks in advance for any insights you can provide,p  pZack Morrisp

Negative 942 pI have an OSX application that uses NSViewController to swap inout views in my NSView. One of the views is a NSOutlineView.

Every view I swap inout is controlled by a NSViewController and I thought I could identify my view positions using the view property of the NSViewController. However, if I replace code[[NSApp keyWindow] contentView]code with codemyViewController.viewcode I receive the error that view does not have a window and the NSPopover crashes. Clearly, I have trouble 1 finding the coordinates of the clicked row in the NSView relative to the main window 2 understanding why my view does not have a window. If anyone has suggestions that could help me understand these problems I would greatly appreciate it.p  pUPDATE 06022013 I am still struggling with my problem but I have discovered that I can get the correct coordinates for my view if I access its properties through my MainWindowController myControlledView. When I then ask for the origin and frame size of my view I get the correct values. My VCs load the custom view as a NIB file and when I ask for the origin of the loaded view I get 0,0. I thought that the position of the view relative to the window would remain unchanged even if I load the view as a NIB I can pass the view origin to my VC and thereby set the NSPopover correctly but this seem rather cumbersome and I would think the NIB loaded view origin was correctly accessible through the VC.p  precodemanagingViewController vc  [viewControllers objectAtIndex[viewIndex intValue]] [self.currentViewController.view removeFromSuperview] [self setCurrentViewControllervc] [self.myControlledView addSubviewvc.view] NSLogMy origin f f,vc.view.frame.origin.x,vc.view.frame.origin.y codepre  pThis results incodeMy origin 0.000000 0.000000code and is not what I am looking for, while thisp  precodeNSLogMy origin f f,self.myControlledView.frame.origin.x,self.myControlledView.frame.origin.y codepre  pResults in the correct origin codeMy origin 176.000000 38.000000codep  pClearly there is something about views and windows I dont understand.

My legacy application source code uses heavy BOOST and OpenCV stuff. Especially, it uses IplImage I hate it, makes life difficult and causes memory leak to store stuff like image masks. I understand that If I save IplImage in long run I will have illegal reference and access violation. so I save the copy of the actual content pointed by the IplImage. To exemplifyp  precode getLongHistory returns IplImage IplImage historylong  motionHistory.getLongHistory  codepre  pThere are total 6 mask images that are made using IplImage. At this moment, I am condemning the programmer who decided to do it in IplImage. The problem arises when I am trying to load those mask images and this is how I do itp  precode Passing pointer to the address of the mask stored alive in the memory motionHistory.setLongHistoryampmatcher.getCurrentSceneObject.getLongHistory codepre  pI believe I am having a problem with deep copy and shallow copy of IplImage objects. I believe doing saving it as cvMat from IplImage and loading it as IplImage from cvMat will probably reduce the burden as I suspect it probably does strongSOMETHINGstrong underneath the highlevel functions so that the copying for data and ROI is done accordingly. But, as a newbee I can assume anything. Please helpp  pstrongemUPDATEemstrongp  pIn my code I was doing this in the pastp  precode I store all my mask images in a vector of pairs made of ltint, IplImagegt   MASKLONG etc. are predefined intergers   getMaskLong etc. methods return IplImage to the respective mask images.      myImages.clear  To make sure that I have no extra stuff   myImages.pushbackstdmakepairltint, IplImagegtMASKLONG, maskHistory.getMaskLong   myImages.pushbackstdmakepairltint, IplImagegtMASKSHORT, maskHistory.getMaskShort codepre  pHowever, after getting suggestions and doing some basic RampA, I am now doing this to prevent shallow copyingp  precode  myImages.clear    myImages.pushbackstdmakepairltint, IplImagegtMASKLONG, cvCloneImagemaskHistory.getMaskLong   myImages.pushbackstdmakepairltint, IplImagegtMASKSHORT, cvCloneImagemaskHistory.getMaskShort codepre  pI can confirm that this works as I can see the latest mask images getting loaded on the OpenCV window And I am pretty certain how IMPORTANT it is to do Deep Copy at least 23 times in any programming task. So thanks for putting me to the right track. But now I have the problem which I was having in mind whilst implementing those changes  memory allocation failure. And the message was encounteredp  precodeOpenCV Error Insufficient memory Failed to allocate 3686404 bytes in OutOfMemoryError,  file homenareshOpenCV2.4.0modulescoresrcalloc.cpp, line 52 codepre  pIf I am deep enough to know about CC, firstly I am commiting a crime of mixing them together I HAVE NO CHOICE IT IS A LEGACY APPLICATION.

Negative 942 pI cant quite figure out what the best way of displaying an image is in my particular case, so hopefully someone on here has a few tips.p  pI want to display an image that gets resized automatically to fit inside the space that is available. I currently do this by creating a class derived from QLabel that implements codevoid resizeEventQResizeEventcode where I do a codeQPixmapscaledcode to resize the image. The problem is that this only works when the widget is enlarged because the widget doesnt get a resizeEvent when I try to make the widget smaller. I guess that because I set the image to the same size as the widget, it isnt allowed to be sized smaller again I guess I could try to create a smaller image therefor introducing a sort of border around the image which would perhaps allow resize events to occur when making the area smaller. Any thoughtsp

However, Im having issues with getting the syntax right in the strongEmployeestrong modelp  precodeSyntaxError in Employeesindex  Showing Usersryrythefrenchfryrailsprojectstimetrackerappviewsemployeesindex.html.erb where line 28 raised  Usersryrythefrenchfryrailsprojectstimetrackerappmodelsfurlough.rb24 syntax error, unexpected end, expecting keywordend   end       Extracted source around line 28  25     lttdgtlttdgt 26     lttdgtlt employee.yearsemployed gtlttdgt 27     lttdgtlttdgt 28     lttdgtlt employee.remainingsickdays gtlttdgt 29     lttdgtlttdgt 30     lttdgtlt employee.remainingvacationdays gtlttdgt 31     lttdgtlttdgt codepre  pWhen I comment out def vacationdaysused and def sickdaysused it goes through, so I know thats where my problem is, but I just dont have a good enough understanding of what Im doing yet to find the answer in documentation.

Negative 942 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzBhnc.png altRelation Modelp  pWhat Im trying to achieve is, I want to automate the values of the table between the strongusersstrong and strongfoldersstrong table. Since its a manytomany relationship I created the stronguserfoldersstrong table. Currently the server nodejs gets the request with emuseridem, emclientfolderidem and some an array of bookmarks which are not important now. It checks if the user already has this folder, by selecting from the stronguserfoldersstrong table and if its not existing it inserts a new row into the strongfolderstrong table. Then it has to send another statement to insert into the stronguserfoldersstrong table.p  pSo I have to manually keep the strongusersfolderstrong table updated.I guess this is a common problem and wanted to know if there is a pattern or a proven solution The odd thing is that MySQL automatically handles the deletion of rows with an AFTER DELETE trigger but there is no at least that I know of automation with an AFTER INSERT trigger.p  pAs I already said an AFTER INSERT trigger could possibly solve it, but I think its not possible to pass some extra parameters to the AFTER INSERT trigger. This would be the userid and the folderclientid in my case.p  pI was thinking of a solution that I could create another table called strongtmpfolderstrong which would look likep  precodetmpfolder  id  title  changed  userid  folderclientid codepre  pThen create an AFTER INSERT trigger on this table which inserts into folders and userfolders and then removes the row from strongtmpfolderstrong again. Would this be the right way or is there a better onep  pI would basically do the same with the bookmarks and userbookmarks table. The best thing would be if its even possible to insert a folder then the owner into the stronguserfoldersstrong table with userid and folderclientid and then multiple other users into stronguserfoldersstrong with the userid and an default folderclientid of 1 or something which will be updated later.p  pMeanwhile thanks for reading and I hope you can help me p  pPS Is there a name for the table between 2 other tables in an m2m relationshipp
Negative 942 pIm setting up buildbot to build a project. The projects code is stored in SVN and it uses a couple of libs in our SVN repository.

Each of them has a number of data fields.

For example, if I specify a given codenamecode, I want to retrieve all the objects whose name member equals the given name. However, if I then add a histogram to the query, I would like the query to return only the objects that match in both the codenamecode and the codehistogramcode fields, and so on. So, for example, Id like a functionp  precodestdsetltObjectgt retrievesizet, stdstring, Histogram, Type codepre  pthat can both dop  precoderetrieve42, WILDCARD, WILDCARD, WILDCARD codepre  pas well asp  precoderetrieve42, WILDCARD, WILDCARD, Typefoo codepre  pwhere the second call would return fewer or equally as many objects as the first one.

Negative 942 pI have another issue in converting my Winforms program to a WPF program. In my first program, I had a smaller window open to allow the user to adjust some data, and then when it closed, the other form was activated again with the new data.p  pI used codeform2.ShowDialogcode to open the form, which automatically makes the parent form deactivated in Winforms. This way when I closed form2, the parent form was activated, and I was able to use an event handler codeform1Activatedcode to reload and reinitialize some of the settings successfully.p  pHowever, now when I attempt to do the same thing with WPF, I am still able to open form2 using  codeform2.ShowDialogcode, but then when I close the form, it does not register the codeform1Activatedcode event handler. Instead, in order to reload the settings, I must click on another window, and then come back into my program to register the codeform1Activatedcode event handler.p  pAm I just doing something wrong, or is there another event handler that I should be using in WPF to achieve the same thing I was able to do in Winformsp

I noticed that, in the above example, if the post 5 belonging to the eating category is the one that has the most votes indeed, then the category appears. BUT if it happens that the post for the eating category which have the mosts votes IS NOT post 5 which is the one MYSQL decided to show up by default, the the whole row about the eating category just WONT SHOW UP at all.p  pIts been 2 days Im on this...

Negative 942 pIf I query for an object say for an Animal and the returned object is not null but contains null variables is that wrong For instance I can call codeanimal.getDeathDatecode and since its not dead yet it returns null. For a Turtle codegetFlightSpeedcode would return null since its unable to fly until it has the Turtle rocket pack added. Etc, etc.p  pI thought that this was a bad way to do things as it will often cause the need for a lot of null checks while calling the methods of the object to verify that they contain nonnull values. Are there any links to information about this that could inform both myself and my coworkers furtherp

Negative 942 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVJlnN.png altenter image description herep  pstrongWhat the aim isstrongp  pIm relatively new to threading. Ive been trying to make QuadTree rendered terrain which    will render fast and efficiently. The amount of terrain which is currently rendered would lag the user majorly if it was all at the maximum detail. This is why Ive used a QuadTree to render it. The engine also supports Input and Physics therefore I decided to use a rendering thread. This has caused lots of problems.p  pstrongThe problemsstrong When i wasnt threading there was a bit of lag due to the other systems in the Engine. The main one that caused the lag is the loading and deletion of terrain in the QuadTree Im not even sure if this is the optimal way to do it. Now, Rendering happens very fast and it doesnt seem to lag. When the camera is standing still the game runs fine. I left the game running for an hour and no crashes were found.p  pWhen terrain is loaded it uses several of the variables the rendering code uses. Namely, binding the buffers p  precode    glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, vertexbuffer     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, vertices.size  sizeofglmvec3, ampvertices[0], GLSTATICDRAW      glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, normalbuffer     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, normals.size  sizeofglmvec3, ampnormals[0], GLSTATICDRAW      glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, uvbuffer     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, uvs.size  sizeofglmvec2, ampuvs[0], GLSTATICDRAW codepre  pThis variable I believe is being accessed at the same time as the other thread. Which causes a crash. How does one fix this I have tried using Mutexes but this doesnt seem to work. Where would I lock and unlock the mutex to fix thisp  pAnother variable that seem to cause the same error are IsLeaf.p  pAnother crash stdbadAlloc is caused after loading a lot of terrain. Even though its beeing cleaned up. I assume this is due to my deletion code but I dont know whats wrong.p  pThe way I currently add and delete the tiles is I check the range from the camera and deletecreate the tile. I want to render the tile im on and the ones around it. However, this doesnt work when transitioning from one of the 4 main tiles. Creating by using the range doesnt work as its the range to the center of the big tile rather than the smaller ones. Ive also tried deleting the whole map every few seconds and this seems to work too but with more lag. Is there a better way to do the creation and destructionp  pBetween different resolutions there are gaps. Is there anyway to reduce these Currently i render the tiles a little larger than they need to be but this doesnt help on major resolution changes. p  pIf you have any idea how to fix one of these errors itd be much appreciated.p  pstrongThe code Too much to upload herestrongp  pa hrefhttppastebin.comMwXaymG0 relnofollowhttppastebin.comMwXaymG0ap  pa hrefhttppastebin.com2tRbqtEB relnofollowhttppastebin.com2tRbqtEBa    p

Negative 942 pSuch questions have been asked before  but all of the answers are outdated now.p  pI am looking forward to work on a Scala based webapp. I understand this question can be split into two, but I am posting them as one because they rely on same context, there being a dependency on the hosting platform and frameworks used.p  pI have read multiple awesome debates on Play and Lift, but cannot find a good comparison between Play 2.1 and Lift. How do I decide which one is better for my scenario a social network website p  pSimilarly, this a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicliftwebJLNvFXOptI relnofollowdiscussiona has some very good arguments as to which platform to use for if I go with Lift, but its from 2010 and seems outdated. The recommended provider stax.net is dead or I guess its merged with cloudbees.com. I am personally inclined towards GAE, as they are quick to start with, but unsure if the issues still prevail p  ol liSupport for actors I am not sure if Akka helps us solve this problemli liRequests for a given session being served by different JVMs without notice to running appli liQuoting David Pollak lead author of Lift li ol  blockquote   pGAE is slow and nonscalable, despite Googles claims everyone Ive   spoken with that have tried to scale GAE apps have failed and gone   elsewhere. GAE locks you into a tremendously suboptimal storage   mechanism. GAE is free, but so is Stax and there are many inexpensive   options including SliceHost.  Next up, youve got Amazon EC2 and   RackSpace. So, I havent found a good reason for anyone to use GAE.    And if theres no good reason to use GAE, devoting a pile of resources   to code around the GAE JVM incompatibilities e.g., no new threads   seems like a waste.p blockquote  pAnother issue if I go with GAE is stronglack of Play 2.1 supportstrong. I still dont see a module for that. Another issue is strongdifficulty to migratestrong to other databases although I hear migrating to MongoDB should be relatively easier in the future. Worst case would be to move out of GAE and use AppScale.p
Negative 942 pI am trying to understand constant reference in C and I stumbled across this problemp  pWhen I assign double to a const intamp and then change the value of the referencing double, the value of my int reference stays constant.p  precode    double i  10     const int ampref  i         i  20      cout ltlt i  ltlt i ltlt endl       i  20     cout ltlt ampref  ltlt ref ltlt endl  ref  10 codepre  pWhereas while assigning int, the value gets changed.p  precode    int i  10     const int ampref  i         i  20      cout ltlt i  ltlt i ltlt endl       i  20     cout ltlt ampref  ltlt ref ltlt endl  ref  20 codepre  pWhat is the reason for this behaviour My guess is that when assigning double, the implicit conversion to int creates a new object and its reference is then being assigned, however I cant find it written down anywhere.p

pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI managed to get the CFD code up and running Yay  The problem is that I am on a 64 bit machine but I was using the 32bit version of MSVS2010 express. I didnt realize this and I was trying to use the intel64 libs i.e. ...tbblibintel64vc10. Somehow this issue manifested in linker errors which doesnt really make sense. Anyway, switching to ia32 cleared up that problem, and the project would build.p  pThe next hurdle was the application complaining about some nondescriptive error like There was an error with the program [registry code]. So I ended up trying to run the TBB examples. The examples gave clearer errors when run, saying The tbb.dll file is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program. After some more googling, I found an easy solution move the dll files it was complaining about into the application directory.p  pThen, at long last, the application worked. The visual effect is so worth it. I cant wait to start playing around with this.p

Negative 942 pI have an MDI application containing an MdiParent form and few MdiChild forms. The MdiParent has a fixed MenuStrip, a fixed ToolStrip and a fixed StatusStrip. The MdiChild forms have one or more ToolStrips and a StatusStrip along with other controls in them. The ToolStrips and the StatusStrip of the MdiChild are generally hidden and are only shown when the form is opened in the MdiParent. Based on this scenario I have the following objectivesp  p1 When an MdiChild is opened in the parent, its ToolStrips should be shown along with the fixed Menu and ToolStrip of the parent. Please note, I m not talking about merging the ToolStrip of the child form to that of the parent. It should show the ToolStrip of the child below the fixed ones of the parent. However, the StatusStrip of the child should merge with that of the parent as usual.p  p2 When an MdiChild is closed, its ToolStrips should be removed from the MdiParent. The StatusStrip should also be unmerged from that of the parent.p  p3 As multiple Mdi children can be opened, the ToolStrips of the currently active MdiChild should be shown in the MdiParent and those of the child losing focus should be removed as usual. The same rule is applicable for the StatusStrips also.p  pWhat I tried to do is, take a ToolStripPanel in the MdiParent and place the fixed Menu and ToolStrip in it. Then, when the MdiChild is opened or gains focus, add its toolstrips into the ToolStripPanel of the parent. Later when the form loses focus or is closed, remove its toolstrips from the ToolStripPanel of the parent.p  pThe handling of the StatusStrips is typically done by the Merge and RevertMerge methods of ToolStripManager class when the child form opensgains focus and closesloses focus respectively.p  pThe relevant code example for one of the child forms followsp  precodePrivate Sub CustomerListActivatedByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Me.Activated         If Not MdiParent Is Nothing Then             Dim parent As Home  MdiParent             Dim lastIndex As Integer  Array.IndexOfparent.ToolStripPanel1.Rows, parent.ToolStripPanel1.Rows.Last             parent.ToolStripPanel1.JoinMe.ToolStrip1, lastIndex  1              Me.ToolStrip1.Visible  True             ToolStripManager.MergeMe.StatusStrip1, CTypeMe.MdiParent, Home.StatusStrip1         End If     End Sub  Private Sub CustomerListDeactivateByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Me.Deactivate         If Not MdiParent Is Nothing Then             Dim parent As Home  MdiParent             Dim lastIndex As Integer  Array.IndexOfparent.ToolStripPanel1.Rows, parent.ToolStripPanel1.Rows.Last             Array.Clearparent.ToolStripPanel1.Rows, lastIndex, 1             parent.ToolStripPanel1.Controls.RemoveAtlastIndex              ToolStripManager.RevertMergeCTypeMe.MdiParent, Home.StatusStrip1, Me.StatusStrip1         End If     End Sub codepre  pBut the problem is, every time I try to close an MdiChild an ObjectDisposedException is thrown stating Cannot access a disposed object. Object name Icon. The problem doesnt arise while traversing through the various MdiChild forms. It doesnt arise while closing the whole application also.p  pAlso, I couldnt find a way to unjoin items from a ToolStripPanel.p  pPlease help in solving this problem. Also mention if theres some better way to achieve the above three objectives.p  pFeel free to ask if I couldnt make myself clear.p  pRegardsp

Negative 942 pGoing through the standard documentation for codestdtransformcode, I noticed that until C11 the functor argument was required not to have side effects, while from C11 onwards the requirement has been made less restrictive  op and binaryop shall not invalidate iterators or subranges, or modify elements in the ranges. Seep  pa hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppalgorithmtransformhttpen.cppreference.comwcppalgorithmtransformap  pand section 25.3.4 of the standard. The webpage on cppreference.com mentions as well that The intent of these requirements is to allow parallel or outoforder implementations of codestdtransformcode.p  pI do not understand then if this snippet of code is legal or not in C11p  precodestdvectorltintgt v fill it with something , vtransformed int foo  0 stdtransformv.begin,v.end,stdbackinsertervtransformed,[ampfoo]const int ampn gt int      foo  1     return n2  codepre  pClearly, if codestdtransformcode is parallelised behind the scenes, we will have multiple concurrent calls to codefoo  1code, which is going to be UB. But the functor itself does not seem to violate the requirements outlined in the standard.p  pThis question can be asked for other standard algorithms except I think codestdforeachcode, which explicitly states that the iteration is to be performed inorder.p  pDid I misunderstand somethingp

Why this difference and what is the correct way to create the diffraction pattern. Are there similar gotchas for going back from the diffraction pattern back to the image that made it Does this only work if one builds the aperture as an array like thisp  pMy python code is as followsp  precodeimport sys import numpy as np import pylab as py from scipy import misc, fftpack   image  misc.imreadsys.argv[1]  D1  fftpack.fft2image D2  fftpack.fftshiftD1  absimage  np.absD2 py.imshowabsimage py.show codepre  pI downloaded and used their circular aperture image as input after cropping of the scales etc, but I get a coloured cross hair on a blue background as a result. There is something that looks like a small dot in the middle of the cross hair. Is this result due to the fact that I am using the downloaded circular aperture image with its square edges or is it due to the codep  pMany thanks in advancep

Negative 942 pOk so I have always been trying to avoid using most of the HTTP protocols properties or how ever you may please to call them for the sake of fear of the unknown.

Negative 942 pI have an applet that uses several external libs. The project requires the applet JAR is signed because I perform disk operations. Another requirement is that all libs are included in the applet jar . My first attempt working this way was to include all the JARs of the libraries in a local directory of the Eclipse project and include them in the Eclipse project. After that I exported the entire project as a nonexecutable JAR, getting run most libs. But some libraries are still not referenced and I can not run my application via applet completely. Is there any more appropriate way to use libs inside a signed applet JARp

Negative 942 pWithout getting too much into the why I need to do this, here is my situation. I need to create an INativeHandleContract to pass a UserControl over an AppDomain boundary, from a new AppDomain into the main AppDomain, where it is then added to a StackPanel. But I am also trying to do this in a different thread. I ran in to a situation where it appears the UserControl is being added correctly if this all runs in the same thread. If I add the UserControl to the StackPanel from a separate thread, it seems to get added but nothing appears on screen. So I boiled this down to the following code and found where the difference is. First the working codep  precodeprivate void AddTestControlInNewThread      System.Threading.Thread t  new System.Threading.ThreadAddTestControl     t.SetApartmentStateSystem.Threading.ApartmentState.STA     t.Start   private void AddTestControl      INativeHandleContract contract     FrameworkElement fe      Dispatcher.Invokenew Action gt               contract  FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapternew Label  Content  DateTime.Now.ToString          fe  FrameworkElementAdapters.ContractToViewAdaptercontract         parentStackPanel.Children.Addfe      , null  codepre  pThat works just fine, however, in my scenario, I cannot create the contract inside of the Dispatcher.Invoke call. So I moved it to just outside of that and thats where thing stop working. Here is the difference in codep  precodeprivate void AddTestControl      INativeHandleContract contract     FrameworkElement fe      contract  FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapternew Label  Content  DateTime.Now.ToString       Dispatcher.Invokenew Action gt                fe  FrameworkElementAdapters.ContractToViewAdaptercontract         parentStackPanel.Children.Addfe      , null  codepre  pCan anyone shine some light on why the user control would not show up, even if it does get added to the parentStackPanels Children collection successfully  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 942 pWe are using Net Tcp binding to call a WCF service in a self hosted environment. The service worked fine with the client creating a new channel for each request.

Negative 942 pSo heres the deal  I have a Visual Studio solution that is made up of numerous projects.  Two of these projects are web application projects.  Of these two, I want to have TFS build deploy one of them to our dev server after a successful buildtest run.  p  pTo get the web app to deploy, I updated the deploy target of my .csproj so it looks like the followingp  precode  ltPropertyGroup Condition ConfigurationPlatform  DebugAnyCPU gt     ltDebugSymbolsgttrueltDebugSymbolsgt     ltDebugTypegtfullltDebugTypegt     ltOptimizegtfalseltOptimizegt     ltOutputPathgtbinltOutputPathgt     ltDefineConstantsgtDEBUGTRACEltDefineConstantsgt     ltErrorReportgtpromptltErrorReportgt     ltWarningLevelgt4ltWarningLevelgt     ltDeployOnBuildgttrueltDeployOnBuildgt     ltDeployTargetgtMsDeployPublishltDeployTargetgt     ltCreatePackageOnPublishgttrueltCreatePackageOnPublishgt     ltMSDeployPublishMethodgtWMSVCltMSDeployPublishMethodgt     ltMSDeployServiceUrlgthttps192.168.21.79ltMSDeployServiceUrlgt     ltDeployIisAppPathgtDeploymentTestltDeployIisAppPathgt     ltUserNamegtdeployltUserNamegt     ltPasswordgtsosecureltPasswordgt     ltAllowUntrustedCertificategttrueltAllowUntrustedCertificategt     ltSkipExtraFilesOnServergttrueltSkipExtraFilesOnServergt   ltPropertyGroupgt codepre  pWith this configuration, my web app was getting deployed to the server successfully.  Unfortunately there was one minor problem.  For reasons that are too frustrating to go into here and at the end of the day, cant likely be changed, when the deploy runs and pushes the app to our server, theres one CSS file in the project that I need skipped.  That is to say, I want the server copy of the file to be left alone, even if its different from whats in the project.  p  pTo support this requirement, I added the following to my .csprojp  precode  ltPropertyGroupgt     ltOnBeforePackageUsingManifestgtAddSkipRulesltOnBeforePackageUsingManifestgt   ltPropertyGroupgt   ltTarget NameAddSkipRulesgt     ltItemGroupgt       ltMsDeploySkipRules IncludeSkipCssgt         ltSkipActiongtDeleteltSkipActiongt         ltObjectNamegtfilePathltObjectNamegt         ltAbsolutePathgtsite.cssltAbsolutePathgt         ltXPathgt         ltXPathgt       ltMsDeploySkipRulesgt       ltMsDeploySkipRules IncludeSkipCss2gt         ltSkipActiongtUpdateltSkipActiongt         ltObjectNamegtfilePathltObjectNamegt         ltAbsolutePathgtsite.cssltAbsolutePathgt         ltXPathgt         ltXPathgt       ltMsDeploySkipRulesgt     ltItemGroupgt   ltTargetgt codepre  pWith this added, my expectation was that the build would skip processing of my site.css file.  Alas, after trying a number of different things, the file always got updated on the server.  After a bit more digging, I found something here on SO or on a blog, dont recall at this point that mentioned the .csproj needs a directive to ensure msdeploy.exe is used to handle the deployment.  With that in mind, I added the followingp  precodeltPropertyGroupgt   ltUseMsDeployExegttrueltUseMsDeployExegt ltPropertyGroupgt codepre  pNow when I run the build, it fails with the following errorp  precodeMSDEPLOY The parameter IIS Web Application Name has already been defined. codepre  pSo, I tried removing the codeltDeployIssAppPathgtcode element from the .csproj but that just led to the following errorp  precodeCProgram Files x86MSBuildMicrosoftVisualStudiov11.0WebMicrosoft.Web.Publishing.targets 4220 The ConcatFullServiceUrlWithSiteName task was not given a value for the required parameter SiteAppName. codepre  pAt this point Im pretty much out of ideas and really need to get this thing working.

Negative 942 pI am running saxon 9HE from the command line to convert a directory of xml files.  The xslt loads a couple of documents as shared reference documents to look up common information  ie. one is a company listing to verify the company and to return company information to display on the the resulting html page and another is a part list to verify the part and return part information to display on the page.  These files can have multiple versions in the xml directory, so I get a collection of them and take the last one which is the most recent one.  p  pWhat I am wondering is during the command line transformation, are these shared documents loadedcached into memory for all input xml files or are they reloaded for every input xml file in the directory being processedp  psample xmlp  precodeltcompaniesgt     ltcompany code123gt     ltaddressgt     ltstreetgt1 MAIN STREETltstreetgt     ltcitygtCityltcitygt     ltstategtSTltstategt     ltcountrygtUSAltcountrygt     ltphoneNumbergt8001234567ltphoneNumbergt     ltaddressgt     ltcompanygt ltcompaniesgt codepre  psample xsltp  precodeltxml version1.0gt ltxslstylesheet version2.0 xmlnsxslhttpwww.w3.org1999XSLTransform            xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt    ltxsloutput methodxhtml xpathdefaultnamespacehttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml             doctypesystemhttpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtd            doctypepublicW3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN             indentyes             omitxmldeclarationyesgt  ltxslparam namecurrentDirgtfalseltxslparamgt ltxslvariable namecompanyCollection selectcollectioniritouriconcat  file,currentDir, xml, selectcompany, .xmlXML[last]gt  ltxslvariable namecompanyDoc selectcompanyCollectioncompaniesgt   ltxslkey namecompanyKey matchcompany usecompanymcodegt  codepre  pIf they are loaded for each individual transformation, how would I get them to be loaded only once while processing the directory of xml files  If not possible from the command line, is it possible from javap  pOr would it be bestfastest to have the file name ahead of time and hard code it in the document command to prevent from loading for each input xml filep  precodeltxslvariable namecompanyDoc selectdocumentcompany.xmlcompaniesgt codepre  pWe are processing thousands of xml files in the directory and would like to make it as efficient as can be.p  pThank youp

Negative 942 pIm trying to draw an American football field for both an iPad and iPhone device using codeUIBezierPathcode, by drawing 12 horizontal lines, two of which mark the beginning of the endzone.  p  pAs you can see from below, the first line starts at the far left of the screen 0 and 112 of the way down, and extends all the way across size.bounds.size.width horizontally. The next line starts at the far left but 212 codeCGPointMake0, self.bounds.size.height  12 2 codeof the way down the view etc. It is calculated in this way for all 12 lines.  I thought, since I was setting the lines using formulas i.e. self.bounds.size.height 12 rather than hard numbers that the whole field would fit on the view no matter what size screen I was using on either device iPad or iPhone. p  pIt works that way on iPad, however, when I view it on the iPhone, it shows one endzone at the top of the iPad screen but then only extends to the 20 yard line at the bottom in portrait view. The situation is even worse when I view it in the smaller iPhone screen 3.5 inch in that it only extends to about the 30 yard line at the bottom of the portrait view.  p  pWhy isnt it  happening the way I plannedp  pUpdate the code below is in the code voiddrawRectCGRectrectcode method in a subclass of UIView, called FieldView.

Negative 942 pI work on an addon that observes all the http requests and populate some info corresponding to each tab. I want to clear the data for the tab which I close. However, I cant get to identiy tab close event in a cleanersaner way. So I have the codecontentWindowcode LoadContext  associatedWindow for which the request was made, and the codebrowsercode for that content window which is for the tab.p  ol liI realized that to do a codebrowser.addEventListenercode, I will have to listen for codeDOMNodeRemovedcode event  which is a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebReferenceEvents relnofollowdeprecated as per MDNa and should rather use mutation observers. Moreover, I wont get the events when a popup window is closed.li liIf I do a codecontentWindow.addEventListenercode and look for codeunloadcode event, the results are quite unpredictable. Some times, I dont get the events at all. li liIf I get this codetabcode element from codegBrowser.tabscode and listen for codeTabClosecode event, I can get all close events for the tab. But then again, it wont inform of any popupwindow closes although I do get a codetabcode element for the popupwindowli ol  pSo what is the easiestcleanest way to know any tabpopupwindow close  I dont use the addon SDK, btw.p  pEDIT  Looking for a simpler, validforallcases solution. ie. I get notified of close event be it a tab or a popupwindow or any other types of windows if they exist. I believe that might be possible given that I hold a browser element which contains the DOM window, and the DOM get removed unloaded upon a close. p  pEDIT2  Realized that all the problem was due to one thing  there is no codeTabClosecode event from Firefox when the last tab closes which is a window close. Life would have been much easier if we were notified of the tabs that get closed when a window closes. Any ways, I will go with a modified version of Noitidarts solution  to have a separate window listener, in addition to the codeTabClosecode listener. And find the codetabcode elements in it and do my clean up. Sigh  Will do a bit more search in this, and see if this qualifies for a bugenhancement. Thanks to Noitidart and Blargh for their suggestions.p
Negative 942 pIm sure this is something basic that Im missing.p  pOn my server side, Im setting a basic cookie, right now its a POC but the idea is that we set a token on the client that represents the session and that will be sent on subsequent requests.  Ive successfully been able to send the cookie to the client.p  pcodeSetCookieStrtUsernamesupp1395843137929foobar.comVersion1Pathcodep  pWhich to me looks right note, its not secured yet.  However it looks like on subsequent requests the cookie isnt getting sent along.  I even went the route of bypassing things like HttpOnly to ensure that the javascript that makes the HTTP Request isnt blocked.  Is there another way to ensure that cookies are always sentp  pNote that this issue didnt occur when I was using Javas JSESSIONID.  It only happens when I use a custom cookie.  Also, I can confirm that cross domain is not an issue here.  I am using nginx to host my javascript based front end, which also has codeproxypasscode enabled for my JBoss AS 7.1.1 backend.  All traffic to localhost8080 follows this route, and the URIs for my rest API all proxied.  I assume that codePathcode just means its for all paths.p

Negative 942 pI want to test the following standard scenario p  ul liAn activity uses a Service object to do some stuff. li liThe Service is bind to the activity with bindService...li liThe service itself allows access via a Binder that it returns in onBind that gives access to the service object itself everything happens on the same thread here.li liIn onServiceConnected.. the activity gets access to the service via the Binder and hands the Service a Handler object to send Messages to the activity.li liSo the communication is Activity  Service via direct calls on Service. And Service  Activity via Handler object injected from Activity into Serviceli ul  pThis scenario works fine. No problems in the App. p  pBut now I also want to write automated Unit Tests and I run into the problem, that the handler does not seem to send and process the messages any more.p  pI wrote an Android JUnit Test like thisp  precodepublic class EpcServiceMockTest extends ServiceTestCaseltEpcServiceMockgt ... codepre  pWith a test method like thisp  precodepublic void testConnectToDevice      Intent serviceIntent  new IntentgetContext, EpcServiceMock.class     IBinder binder  bindServiceserviceIntent     EpcServiceHandlerMock mockHandler  new EpcServiceHandlerMockthis     EpcServiceMock service  EpcServiceMock EpcServiceBase.LocalBinder binder.getServicemockHandler service.doSomething.. codepre  pThis setup works fine. The service runs and does execute the called methods. BUT everytime the handler is used to send messages, the messages are never executed. i.e. handleMessage is never called on the Handler.p  precode    Message callbackMsg  mCallbackHandler.obtainMessageCBCONNECTTONULLDEVICE, mDevice     mCallbackHandler.sendMessagecallbackMsg codepre  pThis code is called. The Handler mCallbackHandler is the correct type. No errors. Just nothing happens. No call to handleMessage in the Handler.p  pFirst I thought there is a race condition, because the Looper is on another thread. So I let the test case sleep for a whilep  precode.. service.doSomething.. Thread.sleep3000 Log.dTAG, Waking up ... callbacks  mockHandler.receivedCallbacks assertEqualsone callback, 1, callbacks.size codepre  pBut still nothing. The handleMessage method in the handler is never called in the test scenario. But it works fine in the real App.p  pIs there a fundamental problem in testing handlers in Android JUnit Testsp

Negative 942 pI have a small ember application that gets data from mysql using node. Currently I use the following to fetch the customer datap  precodefunction handleGetconnection,req,res      var limit  undefined  typeof req.params.limit  200 req.params.limit     connection.querySELECT  FROM customer LIMIT   limit, function handleSqlerr, rows          if err logAndResponderr,res return          if rows.length  0 res.send204 return          res.sendcustomers  rows         connection.release       codepre  phowever I would not want to have a function for customers, another for users, etc.  How can I abstract this  I could pass the table name to the function,no problem. The problem is that Ember expects the name of the table on the response. So I cannot change the line p  precoderes.sendcustomers  rows codepre  ptop  precoderes.sendtablename  rows codepre  psince it sends literally the word tablename rather than content of the variable, like this tablename[id1,statusn.....]p  pThanksp
Negative 942 pI just want to know how I can insert white space onto an HTML page with a fixed size. For example something like thisp  precodeltdiv width48 height48gtltdivgt codepre  pBut that doesnt work. So I tried adding an image tag without a source like thisp  precodeltimg width48 height48gt codepre  pThat worked but there was a 48x48 square with nothing inside it as there is no image source. I tried using CSS to change border to 0 pixels and setting its colour to white but it doesnt work and the square stays.p  pThen I tried using break tags but the problem with them is I cant have an exact 48x48 empty white space.p  pHow does one go about inserting a fixed size white space in their pagep  pAnd if youre wondering why I want to add a white space. Its because in that white space a little image appears later on and when it does, all the stuff that was there moves down to make space for the image but I dont want things moving around like that. So I want to insert a white space the same size as my image and then replace the space with an image.p  pIm going to be putting the space in a div and then using .innerHTML to change the code inbetween the div tags to replace the space with an image.p

Negative 942 pstrongThe setupstrongp  pI have a query thats running with a large IN condition. I wont get into why I have to do it this way, I know its a bad idea, but it must be done that way.p  pSo the raw query would look something like thisp  precodeSELECT  FROM table WHERE col1 IN 1,2,3,4....150000 codepre  pstrongThe questionstrongp  pThe main problem is that when I try running this query with doctrine, it creates a placeholder for each item, which is about 150,000 items. This puts a heavy load on sql to replace them, as well as PDO for some reason in fetching them. Details on that are below. p  pMy main question is how can i use the entire array as a comma delimited list and a single replacement. It sounds easy but every way I can think of doesnt work.p  pstrongWhat I have done so farstrongp  pI have all those numbers in an array idsp  pUsing doctrine query builderp  precodeqb  createTheQueryBuilderSELECT  FROM table WHERE col1 IN ids qbgtsetParameterids, ids, ConnectionPARAMINTARRAY results  qbgtexecute pairs  resultsgtfetchAllPDOFETCHKEYPAIR codepre  pThe problem with the above method is that it creates a single  place holder for each value. Because ids is such a large array, this makes the query and fetching extremely slow. Im not sure if its a bug in the PDO drive as far as the fetching goes, but it too slow  it actually seems to stop responding completely and the php thread keeps running at 100 for hours to run resultfetchAllp  pThe next thing i tried wasp  precodeqb  createTheQueryBuilderSELECT  FROM table WHERE col1 IN ids qbgtsetParameterids, implode,, ids  lt changed here  results  qbgtexecute pairs  resultsgtfetchAllPDOFETCHKEYPAIR codepre  pThe problem with this is that it only returns the first result. Im not sure how or why its doing that.p

For example, I tried to double the vector of egg numbers and cbind it on to the melted data frame, but then when I plotted the text using annotate it put an egg number in both the Fert and Unfert block of each column so 2 values, while I only want one value representing the total number of eggs in each sample, or column, at the top of each column. Using the geomtext function is also a bit wacky, as when I try to add coordinates I cant seem to add specific coordinates for each variable i.e. Nassau, Nassau PT, Tiger, Tiger PT, only universal coordinates which are then applied to each facet. Any suggestionsp  pThanksp

Negative 942 pI am trying to use MR job to solve the following problem. I have a huge table Fields in Hive, containing info about users collected from several SQL DBs. Records in this table has the following formatp  precodeuserid, dbname, tablename, fieldname, fieldvalue codepre  pI am trying to build all possible pairs of users that have one or more values equal for these users in some of their fields.  For example, with the following records in table Fields p  precodeuserid  10021, dbname  db1, tablename  contacts,  fieldname  phone, fieldvalue  613 5246 2433 userid  10021, dbname  db1, tablename  contacts,  fieldname  usermail,  fieldvalue  johnfoobar.com userid  10021, dbname  db1, tablename  contacts,  fieldname  addres, fieldvalue  21,Sunset Beach  ... userid  37756, dbname  db2, tablename  userinfo, fieldname  mobile, fieldvalue  613 5246 2433 userid  37756, dbname  db2, tablename  userinfo, fieldname  wrkemail, fieldvalue  johnfoobar.com userid  37756, dbname  db2, tablename  userinfo, fieldname  wrkaddr, fieldvalue  15, Circus Drive codepre  pIn this case I need to build the folowing records describing a pair of codematchingcode usersp  precodeuser1  10021, user2 37756, field1  usermail, field2  wrkemail, value   johnfoobar.com user1  10021, user2 37756, field1  phone, field2  mobile, value  613 5246 2433 codepre  pTo achieve these my mapper function reads records from huge Fields table in Hive. For each record a I create a keyvalue pair key  fieldvalue, value  FieldInfo, where FieldInfo contains the remaining fields from this record userid, dbname, tablename, fieldname, fieldvalue.  p  pAs a result reducer function gets a very long stream of FiledInfo objects associated with a key equal to a specific filed value. To build codepaircode records from this stream, I need to find all  combinations of any two codeuseridcodes contained in thsese FiledInfo objects.p  pSo for example, for a field value codejohnfoobar.comcode I may get several thousands of FiledInfo elements with distinct codeuseridcodes. Which means I need to build several thousands cominations of two ids. To build these pairs I need to be able to iterate all, lets say N  elements N times. p  pI can only move forward along a stream that reducer provides, so I tried  to write this stream into a linked List. As it turned out, with this approach I run out of memory quite soon.p  pAny other ideas how to build combinations from a very long stream that reducer provides Maybe I need to use entirely different approach for this task, other ideas for mapper and reducer functions    p  pThanksp  pAny comments at allp

The main answers given didnt work such as installing driver updates or reinstalling the application. Keep in mind this is an app in development and it was working fine earlier this day. Between two test launches this happened.p  pEDIT After testing the application on a tablet it turns out the development pc is the only machine with the UI loading bug. Going to look into it some more and ill let you guys know if i find a solution.p  pEdit 2 So after testing the app on the tablet and finding that it works fine there we decided to test the app on a 2nd development pc. Needless to say the same thing happened... in other words its a rendering issue that happens on windows 8.1 PCs but not on a tablet.p  pFacts as of now  Code worked yesterday, no longer works now  Works on tablet but not on PC  Nothing changed in the code since it worked  Seems to happen in the rendering stages  Bug happens when loading more than 23 items in a listview, app restores itself then  Any more than 23 items and it stays bugged dark blue screen but still responds to clicksp

The thing is, it doesnt seem to matter what you put after the equals sign herep  precodeh4 amazingintelligenthelpermethodbutsadlytoolate                codepre  pbecause Haml has already decided to output a tag at that point, the only question is what goes in the tag If the expression after the equals sign evaluates to nil, Haml doesnt put any content in the tag  but it still outputs the tag itself. p  precodeh4 nil                   output lth4gtlth4gt h4                     output lth4gtlth4gt h4 false                 unexpected output lth4gtfalselth4gt  h4                       HamlSyntaxError Theres no Ruby code for  to evaluate. codepre  pSo at the moment, I dont have a oneline way of omitting empty tags.

Negative 942 pI have run into an issue recently where we have been told to remove the hash symbols from our Backbone applications. This presents two problems a the ASP.NET routes need to handle any remotely linked URL currently this is no problem with the hash symbols so that were not hitting a 404 error and b the proper route needs to be preserved and passed on to the client side Backbone application.

However, if I manually navigate to them using codeappRouter.navigatehelp,  trigger true code the routes are caught and events fired.p  pIm at a loss at this point as to where I should start troubleshooting next.

Now, when the other projects Project1 etc do their build it cannot find the Common Assemblies, as not only are they removed, but the paths are different from what it expects them to be in casrcCommonBinaries instead of casrcBinaries.p  pIs there anyway to tell the build server to not delete those files in the Binaries directory and to specify the folder location to checkout to Or how one one go about solving such a problemp  pThanks very muchp

And then what width should have back.png  375 or 414p  pGraphics names are using 2x and 3x suffixes so if for example image3x.png has 30x30 resolution then logically thinking image2x.png should have 20x20 resolution and image.png should be 10x10. This means that if we want to have sharp full width image for each screen then we probably should create back3x.png with width 41431242px, back2x.png with width 4142828px and back.png with width 414px. This however means that on every iPhone except for iPhone 6 Plus you will need to setup your uiimages to use for example aspect fit content mode and they will be scalled down so this again is not a perferct solution and probably would really slow down the application if we use a lot of scalling on older devices.p  pSo what do you think would be the best solution to solve this problemp

Negative 942 pEarlier this week I had a great deal of difficulty reverting the project properties that Clover changes when it runs so that it wouldnt interfere with subsequent pluginsp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25984565howtorevertmavenprojectbuildvariablesaftercloverpluginfinishesHow to revert Maven project.build variables after Clover plugin finishesap  pI solved this issue by saving these properties when Maven starts up and using the saved variables in my plugins instead of the ones which Clover alters.p  pNow that Im able to host the noninstrumented WAR file in the preintegrationtest phase my tests are able to run successfully and pass previously, I was unable to run the app from the instrumented WAR file since Clover was not on the release class path.p  pUnfortunately, Im finding that the forked Clover life cycle continues beyond the test phase.  After my tests pass and the embedded Tomcat instance shuts down the original lifecycle runs the Tomcat7 plugin again, starts the server, and reruns the test.p  pI can live with it running my unit tests twice this can catch edge case bugs which only appear with or without Clover instrumentation, but running my integration tests twice is entirely unnecessary.  These tests dont touch the production code theyre using Selenium to automate UI testing against it in the browser.  As mentioned, the instrumented WAR file was not working anyway, so its no longer even there when the integration tests are run.  There is absolutely no reason that these tests need to be run again.p  pHow can I tell Clover to terminate the forked lifecycle after the test phase completes so that the integration tests will only run once  Im currently only able to enable it for the entire lifecycle or not at all.p  pstrongUpdatestrong  Ive found that even if I disable the Clover plugin by passing in Dmaven.clover.skiptrue that it will still fork the lifecycle.  The only way Ive found to prevent this is to comment out the Clover plugin entirely so that it does not have a chance to fork the lifecycle before skipping instrumentation.p

I am given two arrays of floating point values expressed as doubles, each of the same length, the first containing the values and the 2nd containing their respective weights.p  pLets also say I make some implementation, that returns a floating point value also a double representing the Weighted arithmetic mean of the input valuesp  precodepublic static double calculateWeightedArithmeticMeandouble[] values,          double[] weights       ifvalues.length  weights.length          throw new IllegalArgumentException           ifvalues.length  0          return 0           ifvalues.length  1          return new BigDecimalvalues[0].setScale1, RoundingMode.HALFUP.                 doubleValue           BigDecimal dividend  BigDecimal.ZERO     BigDecimal divisor  BigDecimal.ZERO     forint i  0 i lt values.length i          dividend  dividend.addnew BigDecimalvalues[i].                 multiplynew BigDecimalweights[i]         divisor  divisor.addnew BigDecimalweights[i]          ifdividend.compareToBigDecimal.ZERO  0          return 0d          return dividend.dividedivisor, 1, RoundingMode.HALFUP.doubleValue  codepre  pI write a unit test passing a few values like, 3 values  3 weights. I first make a manual calculation of their Weighted arithmetic mean using a calculator and then write a unit test that checks that my code returns that value.p  pI believe that such a test is not pertinent for a situation where the number of values used is substantially larger, due to rounding errors. Maybe the code Ive implemented works well for 3 values  3 weights for a given precision because the rounding error is less than the precision in this case, but its very possible that the rounding error becomes greater than the desired precision for 1000 values  1000 weights. p  pMy question isp  ul lishould I also write an unit test that checks for a very large number of values a worst case scenario for production use li liif I should, how do I write it How to I obtain the correct value, so that I can use it in my tests assertions calculating the means by hand for 2x1000 values seems like kind of a bad idea, even if using an a hrefhttpeasycalculation.comstatisticsweightedmeancalculator.php relnofollowWeighted mean calculatora ...li lithe same goes for similar scenarios calculating the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGeometricmean relnofollowgeometric meana, etc...li ul

Negative 942 pIm working in C on 64bit Ubuntu 14.04.p  pI have a number of .txt files, each containing lines of floating point values 1 value per line. The lines represent parts of a complex sample, and theyre stored as reala1 n imaga1 n reala2 n imaga2, if that makes sense.p  pIn a specific scenario there are 4 text files each containing 32768 samples thus 65536 values, but I need to make the final version dynamic to accommodate up to 32 files the maximum samples per file would not exceed 32768 though. Ill only be reading the first 19800 samples depending on other things though, since the entire signal is contained in those 39600 points 19800 samples.p  pA common abstraction is to represent the files  samples as a matrix, where columns represent return signals and rows represent the value of each signal at a sampling instant, up until the maximum duration. p  pWhat Im trying to do is take the first sample from each return signal and move it into an array of doubleprecision floating point values to do some work on, move on to the second sample for each signal which will overwrite the previous array and do some work on them, and so forth, until the last row of samples have been processed.p  pIs there a way in which I can dynamically open files for each signal depending on the number of pulses Im using in that particular instance, read the first sample from each file into a buffer and ship that off to be processed. On the next iteration, the file pointers will all be aligned to the second sample, it would then move those into an array and ship it off again, until the desired amount of samples 19800 in our hypothetical case has been reached.p  pI can read samples just fine from the files using fscanfp  precoderxlength  19800 int x float buf  double rangesamples  callocnumpulses, 2  sizeofrangesamples  for i0 i lt 2  rxlength i     x  fscanfpulsefile, f, ampbuf     rangesamples  buf  codepre  pAll that needs to happen in my mind is that I need to cycle both sample and pulse in that order, so when finished with one pulse it would move on to the next set of samples for the next pulse, and so forth. What I dont know how to do is to somehow declare file pointers for all return signal files, when the number of them can vary inbetween calls e.g. do the whole thing for 4 pulses, and on the next call it can be 16 or 64.p  pIf there are any ideas  comments  suggestions I would love to hear them.p  pThanks.p
Negative 942 pIve been trying to fix this issue all day but cant seem to figure out whats going wrong. I have a UIScrollView which has a UITableView and numerous UITextFields as subviews. When I click the UITextField the UIScrollView will adjust its contentOffset so the textfield appears above the keyboard.

This option enables you to perform undercolor removal and black generation on CMYK images      images   to be printed on a fourcolor printing system. You can con trol how much cyan, magenta, and yellow to remove from your image and how much black to add to it. The standard undercolor removal is 1.0x1.0. Youll frequently get better results, though, if the percentage of black you add to your image is slightly higher than the percentage of C, M, and Y you remove from it. For example you might try 0.5x0.7. httpwww.chemie.fuberlin.dechemnetusesupplimagemagickwwwconvert.html   codepre  papparently the option is not supported anymore, Im interested if anyone knows if UCR is the solution Im looking for and if anyone knows if its supported or if Im supposed to use a different method to get the same result.p

Negative 942 pI am currently reading emRealWorld Functional Programming With Examples in F and Cem by Tomas Petricek and Jon Skeet. I am a bit puzzled by a particular example in which we generate an application that displays a pie chart with some population statistics along with labels.p  pNow it is the part of drawing the label or rather setting the coordinates of the label that I am confused by. I hope that the author doesnt mind that I attach the excerpt here but it would be hard to get clarification on the code without showing it.p  precodelet centerX, centerY  300.0, 200.0 let labelDistance  150.0  let drawLabel gr Graphics title startAngle angle       let lblAngle  floatstartAngle  angle  2     let ra  Math.PI  2.0  lblAngle  360.0     let x  centerX  labelDistance  cosra     let y  centerY  labelDistance  sinra     let size  gr.MeasureStringtitle, fnt     let rc  new PointFfloat32x  size.Width  2.0f,                         float32y  size.Height  2.0f     gr.DrawStringtitle, fnt, Brushes.Black, new RectangleFrc, size codepre  pIt seems that codelabelDistancecode and codecenterX, centerYcode define some standard offset from the center of the drawing surface and Im guessing that the trigonometric functions define the angle of the label because if I omit those then all labels are placed on top of eachother in the bottom right corner. But I dont quite understand emhowem this works. What exactly happens herep

Negative 942 pI currently have the default codesearchBarcode of a codeUISearchBarControllercode set as the codetableHeaderViewcode of a codeUITableViewcode.p  pThe codeUITableViewcode instance is a property codetableViewcode of a codeUITableViewControllercode, and on top of this I have a separate codeUIViewControllercode which casts a drop shadow over any views below it. Like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyFVdG.png altWith Drop Shadowp  pHowever, as soon as the codeUISearchBarcode becomes active, it becomes the topmost view, and I therefore lose the shadow on the search bar, like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYzSMF.png altWithout Shadowp  pIt seems that the codeUISearchBarcode is being brought to the front emafterem the delegate method codesearchBarTextDidBeginEditingcode is called, so I cant figure out when I can change  its position in the view hierarchy.p  pIs there any way I can alter thisp
Negative 942 pI wrote an application CCX that targets Windows 8.1 and today I wanted to check it with WACK 3.4 tool for the first time. The report said that Supported API test had failed. Im pretty sure I dont use any illigal API. I dont use 3rd party libraries either. I tried all solutions Ive googled but non of them worked.p  pMy next step was to create brand new CCX project that targets Windows 8.1 and try to validate it. When I did it, Ive bumped into the very same issue.p  pHere is the report its in polish but it baiscly says that given API is not supported by this type of application. I have the same errors for both applications.p  precodeInterfejs API 0ChangedStateExceptionPlatformQAAAXZ w vccorlib120app.dll nie jest obsugiwany dla tego typu aplikacji.

Negative 942 pIm trying to implement an NVD3 line chart using AJAX to load JSON data for 3 series.p  pI am using .NET MVC to expose my formatted JSON at HomeGetJsonMovingAverages.p  pIf I copy and paste this data, it all loads correctly on the graph, but by loading it via Ajax causes it to break without apparent error.p  pIve tried alerting the datato prove its loaded, using callbacks to enforce waiting, disabling async in the .ajax method, and a plethora of other checks, none of which have helped me identify or expose the problem.p  pIts simply beyond me.p  pThe below code grabs the JSON using d3, and then tries to render it on the graph. This is as close to the demo code as I can possibly make it. I also render the JSON data to the page to indicate when its loaded and that its correct. it takes 510 seconds p  pWhen the JSON appears on the page its properly formatted and correct, but no chart appears.p  pstrongEDIT  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netQsHw46123 relnofollowJSFIDDLEastrongp  pNOTE Now found it gives error strongTypeError data.map is not a functionstrong on nv.d3.js line 5476, col 23

Negative 942 pIm trying to get this code to produce an array comprising unique random musical notes. It will, based on parameters given make a note and assign an accidental sign to it, with a possibility of either displaying as its flat or sharp counterpart. For example, if the random generator said the note A will be flat, theres a chance it will show up as either A or G.p  pNow, I havent handled the halfstep notes e.g. C is turned into B, etc., but thats mainly because the first part isnt working.

Negative 942 pI have a Facebook page with 3000 followers. It is necessary that these users get a push notification when I post something on Facebook with my page because the information I post is useless after some hours. This should happen in less then 5 minutes to all followers, of course only if they got my app.p  ol lipIs it possible to realize this with the Facebook android SDK only  I havent found any possbility and I dont think this is possible at all.pli lipI have 2 other scenarios to realize thisp  ul lipA SQL database somewhere on the web, everytime a user installs and starts my app, it registers itself on the Google push service GCM and sends his registrationID to my database where I store it. When I post something, I simply press a button on another app which only I have, this pulls all the registrationIDs of the database and sends the message to all of them. I know that there is a limitation of 1000 usersmessage but splitting one message into 3 should not be a problempli lipA backend server which offers multicast messages at least 100 push messagessecond.  This could work this way A user installs and starts my app in which I have integrated a registrationlogin for the backend service, he logs into his account and sends his GCM key to the backend server, which stores them. Everytime I post something on facebook, I ask the backend service to send a push message to all registrated users. The problem is that I only found provider who concentrate on sending single push messages and limit them to about 20 push messagessecond. I want it as simple and clean as possible for the user and an extra loginregistration on an backend server would bloat my app. If there is a backend which offers everything I said it shouldnt cost more than 5month, because the users should use my service for free. pli ulli ol  pCan these scenarions workp  pTo be honest, I dont think my two scenarios are that good. Is there any other option to realize what I wantp

Since my business logic makes some validations with the date, it is very strict with the dates format, so I made the textbox readonly to prevent users from messing up the dates format. The problem is that now with this property set to codetruecode the codetextbox.Textcode property is set to codecode all the time.p  pFrom what I found out on microsofts forums about this property, it says thatp  blockquote   pthe server does no processing for a readonly text box. This prevents a malicious user from changing a Text value that is readonly. The value of the Text property is preserved in the view state between postbacks unless modified by serverside codep blockquote  pand then they suggest to use the codecontentEditablecode property instead. Problem is that this property works only on IE browser, which is not what we need cause users must be able to access the site from any browser.p  pSo I was wondering if there was a way to do this without using this property.p  pThanks in advance for your kind helpp

Negative 942 pabout integrity checking of files, I am not sure if CRC32 or MD5 checksum generate unpredictable hash valuesp  pWhen checking if files are identical, usually CRC32 or MD5 checksum is used. It means that each file that is possibly a duplicate of another is read from the beginning to the end and a unique number will be calculated based on its unique binary content. As a fingerprint, this number is stored and used to compare the files contents to other files to determine if they are truly identical. That means a tiny change in a file results in a fairly large and unpredictable change in the generated hash.p
Negative 942 pI would like to solve an equation for x, and i know that there are atleast two solutions,which means that jj will be a vector.

Negative 942 pI would like to share this code and ask to improve it.

Goldberg, who started with Lawrence Kamin in 2001, focuses his practice on commercial litigation, concentrating in securities and commodity futures law and alternative dispute resolution. He is also a trained mediator.ltpgtltpgtHis reputation for keeping the big picture in mind, rather than focusing solely on the individual case or issue before him, recently helped a large client with multiple FINRA arbitration claims that all had the same arbitrator as a panelist, but were not all represented by Lawrence Kamin. When that panelist ruled negatively in Mitchs case, Mitch contemplated bringing a motion to strike the arbitrator under FINRA guidelines prohibiting panelists from serving on multiple cases involving the same respondents. Even though this would have substantially advanced his own case, he instead suggested a conference call with all of the clients outside attorneys handling the remaining arbitrations to determine a joint strategy that would provide the biggest benefit to the mutual client. Ultimately the motion to strike was successfully brought in the case most likely to benefit.ltpgtltpgtHe is also wellrespected for his integrity, honesty and candor, which have earned him the trust of many judges and opposing counsel. This strength has often allowed Mr. Goldberg to achieve consensus in cases where other people wouldnt be able to achieve an agreement. For example, in one matter, distrust among the attorneys and parties resulted in a refusal of the plaintiffs to even discuss settlement. Mitch stepped in and, due to the opposing attorneys mutual respect, helped negotiate a settlement satisfactory to both sides.ltpgtltpgtMitchs active membership on the boards of various legal committees and law societies, including the Chicago Bar Association and the Decalogue Society of Lawyers, reinforces his intent to continually improve the legal profession, as well as his desire to provide the best possible guidance to clients by keeping abreast of the latest developments in the law. Mitch has lectured to the Decalogue Society of Lawyers and taught securities litigation at IITs ChicagoKent College of Law with other members of the firm.ltpgtltpgtWhen not working for clients, serving on various boards or teaching, Mitch loves spending time with his wife Natasha and their four beautiful children, Rachel, Zachary, Jesse and Abigale.ltpgt, email mgoldberglksu.com, fax 312.372.2389, phone312.924.4263, areas [altdispute, litigation, securities], experience Lawrence, Kamin, Saunders amp Uhlenhop LLCltbrgtampnbspampnbspampnbspPartner 2007PresentltbrgtampnbspampnbspampnbspAssociate 20012007ltbrgtltbrgtBlau amp Bonavich, 19992001, education DePaul University, J.D., with honor, 1999ltbrgtampnbspampnbspampnbspltemgtOrder of the CoifltemgtltbrgtltbrgtDePaul University, B.A., highest honor, 1996, honors 2008  2010, 2012  2014ltbrgtampnbspampnbspampnbspRising Star in Securities Litigation,ltbrgtampnbspampnbspampnbspSuper Lawyers  Magazineltbrgtltbrgt2011 Decalogue Award of Excellenceltbrgtltbrgt2011 DePaul 14 under 40, articles Y, baradmissions State ofIllinois, courtadmissions United States District CourtsltbrgtampnbspampnbspampnbspNorthern District of IllinoisltbrgtampnbspampnbspampnbspSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals, memberships Chicago Bar AssociationltbrgtampnbspampnbspampnbspCoChair, ADR Committee, 20052007ltbrgtltbrgtChicago Lincoln Inn of CourtltbrgtampnbspampnbspampnbspPupilage CoChair, 20062010ltbrgtampnbspampnbspampnbspMentoring VP, 2012PresentltbrgtltbrgtNational Inns of CourtltbrgtampnbspampnbspampnbspIllinois State Liaison, 2009PresentltbrgtltbrgtDecalogue Society of LawyersltbrgtampnbspampnbspampnbspBoard of Managers, 2006PresentltbrgtltbrgtDePaul University College of Liberal Arts amp Sciences Deans Advisory Board, Vice Chairltbrgtampnbspampnbspampnbsp2010 to present   ]  codepre

Negative 942 pI am developing a keyboard in Android a braille keyboard, specifically. For those of you who do not know, braille is composed of six dots, and combinations of these dots form symbols. I wrote a keyboard using the KeyboardView class with the basic listener, but the problem is this the default listener only allows for one key to be pressed at a time. To form the letter l requires three dots dots 1, 2 and 3. I have to press each key individually, followed by the spacebar to write the letter. I would like the keyboard to function in a different way all dots can be pressed simultaneously, and when the dots are released, the letter is written. Am I right when thinking this is impossible with the listener bundled with KeyboardView If I rewrite the onTouch routine in the KeyboardView, would this latter functionality be possible Does the OnTouch function detect multiple actiondown events simultaneously I was thinking that if this is possible, I can determine the xy coordinates of the press, loop through the keys on the keyboard, and determine which keys are being pressed. If this is not possible, will I have to go a step below this and write onTouch for a basic view Thank you so much.p

Negative 942 pSo I started using python requests to look at the html code from some websites. I would do r  requests.geturl to get all the information I need. p  pHowever, I noticed that this doesnt work sometimes. For example, Im using steamcommunity.com to get some market data, so I used the url a hrefhttpsteamcommunity.commarketsearch relnofollowhttpsteamcommunity.commarketsearcha. This brings up the first page of items out of over 7,000 pages. To get a different page, I used this url a hrefhttpsteamcommunity.commarketsearchp4quantitydesc relnofollowhttpsteamcommunity.commarketsearchp4quantitydesca. This should take you to the 4th page of the website, and it does if you put it in your browser. But, when I go to read the html code, I get the same code from both urls, even though they should point to different pages with different code.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated Thanksp

This application requires lots of image processing so, as most of us know that Bitmaps pixels accessing using GDI methods codeGetPixelcode and codeSetPixelcode is quite slow.

Then I cast it in a codecharcode array in order to split hour and minute values and I put them in the codecalendar.setcode function, distinguishing if the value starts with 0 to avoid an octal conversion when I cast them to codeintcode.p  pOnce the time has been set, the codeAlarmReceivercode class extends codeBroadcastReceivercode does the followingp  precodeOverride public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent      String mName  intent.getStringExtramName     String mFormat  intent.getStringExtramFormat      NotificationCompat.Builder builder  new NotificationCompat.Buildercontext     builder.setAutoCanceltrue     builder.setTickerIts pill time     builder.setContentTitlemName     builder.setContentTextmFormat     builder.setSmallIconR.drawable.iclauncher      Notification notification  builder.build     NotificationManager nManager  NotificationManager context.getSystemServicecontext.NOTIFICATIONSERVICE     nManager.notify0, notification  codepre  pThere arent compilation errors, I just cant spot the issue.

Negative 942 pI am running into a dependency catch 22.  Service A must run before service B to install some method hooks that service B will use.  However, I want one of the installed methods to use service B.  Service A and B will both initialize before any other code is run, my init logic is responsible for that.p  pThe easiest thing for me to do would be to make service A install a method that uses service B, but does not actually load service B until the method installed by service A is run.  Thus A can run before B, installing all the hooks required, but can still use service B when the appropriate methods is called, at which time its safe for B to initialize since A has already done its thing.p  pIs there a convenient way to do this in Angular  It looks like the inject service might do this, but if so Im not certain how to make it work.p  pedit I didnt add psudo code originally because the example I have uses restangular and would get confusing.  Ive tried to come up with some stupid psudocode example of something similar, though my actual situation is not quite as straight forward, I dont get circle dependencies, just odd behavior if the dependencies are not right.p  precodeangular.modelmyProj.common.factoryRestCaller, funciton      var route      return route functionroute          var get function  does stuff          var save function does stuff         var getPermissions functionPermissionService              PermissionService.getPermissionsroute                     angular.modelmyProj.common.factoryPermissionService, funcitonRestCaller      return               getPermissions functionroute                        return RestCaller.routeroute.get                                codepre  pHere restCaller uses PermissionService for one method but PermissionService uses RestCaller.

Negative 942 pLet Me simplify this question.p  pIf I run opencv MLP train and classify consecutively on the same data, I get different results. Meaning, if I put training a new mlp on the same train data and classifying on the same test data in a for loop, each iteration will give me different results. Even though I am creating a new mlp object each iteration. However, if instead of using a for loop I just run the program a few times, restarting the program after each train and classify the results are exactly the same.p  pSo question is, does opencv use previous weights, variables, or something of the sorts from other mlp trains Even though it is not the same mlp object. Anyone know why it does this p  pThanks for the time Timp

I dont mind having missed the answer, but Im new to tkinter and to multithreading in general so I might need it told more explicitly.p  pThis code is for a simulation of a game show I saw online. Most of it can probably be safely ignored, but Im pasting it all here because I dont know where the error is from.p  precodeimport re from tkinter import Tk, Frame, DISABLED, Button, Label, font,

Negative 942 pAfter discussing with a colleague, we are mixed in where we think logic relating to the view should go.p  pFor example lets say we have a number that we want to show in our view. I think the codenumberformatcode or codeCakeNumberformatcode as were using CakePHP should go in the view as its related to what we show. My colleague thinks it should go in the controller because thats where all logic goes.p  pIn this case we have two views, one for the website and end users and an API view which returns a json response. If I were to put the code in the controller Id have to check which view Im using as not to give a string in the json response when really it is an integer. For this reason Im heavily supporting the code in the view.p  pThe question is, who is more right, where should that number formatting gop  pFurther to my argument of putting code in the view, he is happy to use codehtmlentitiescode in the view but I argue that if Im not allowed numberformat, he cant have codehtmlentitiescode and that it should be done in the controller.p

This method recognizes the datamethod attribute of the element. If the attribute exists,       the method will submit the form containing this element. If there is no containing form, a form       will be created and submitted using the method given by this attribute value e.g. post, put.       For hyperlinks, the form action will take the value of the href attribute of the link.       For other elements, either the containing form action or the current page URL will be used       as the form action URL.             If the datamethod attribute is not defined, the href attribute if any of the element       will be assigned to window.location.             Starting from version 2.0.3, the dataparams attribute is also recognized when you specify       datamethod. The value of dataparams should be a JSON representation of the data namevalue pairs       that should be submitted as hidden inputs.

Negative 942 pSuppose in addition of simple text terms i want to retrieve some complex data from text. For example, text can contain descriptions of graphs in some format. After that I want to do queries which contain some conditions on those graphs for examle I want to find all documents with planar graphs or something like this. It seems that standard index of Solr is not sufficient for such a task because in the end it as I understand treats document in terms of tokens which are just strings, but I need additional index which have more suited format. So question is can I somehow customize indexing and retrieving data from index in Solr Ive read a lot of documentation but could not find an answer. p
