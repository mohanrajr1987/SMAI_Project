Positive 2051 pplease let me introduce the issue, that I think it could be a very common onep  ol lipI want to store an android application data in a common storage system for all the users of that application. You can think of storing records for an android game for example where every player can see the other players records but he is only able to modify his own record.pli lipIve choosen to create a REST api java based and to use google app engine to host it and use google cloud storage available from GAE to store the data.  Its just a simple web application without any web page at all, just the REST urls.pli lipRegarding to security, there are two mayor concerns herepli ol  p3.1. The only one application authorized to use such REST api should be the given android application, it must be 100 secure so just the application can have access, so no decompilation or similar hacking of the apk could lead to someone having access to the REST api.p  p3.2. It could be convinient to have access to user data such as phone number or email address from the server without the need of asking the user for it. Kind of logging using a google account.p  pAny of the two 3.1 or 3.2 could be enought by itself to feel the application and REST api as safe enought.p  pIve readed a ton of posts regarding GAE credentials andor Oauth2 but still searching for a simple tutorial or a good explanation of a similar design application securing. Im pretty sure this architecture is pretty common in almost every single android app wich stores user data in a common place.p  pThanks a lot.p

Positive 2051 pMy team has an API we wrote in PHP using the Slim Framework. Its being consumed by a web app and a third party mobile app. p  pWe use the standard OAuth 2 workflow to provide access to our resources. We can see if someone is a sending a valid access token along with the API request and that part of the flow makes sense.p  pThe stumbling block were running into is how to most efficiently authorize access to a resource depending on the permissions of the user associated with the access token.p  pFor the sake of simplicity lets say that we just want to ensure that the owner of the resource in question matches the owner of the access token. To me that seems like something that a route middleware would handle, for every request, before processing the request make sure that the resource owner ID matches that of the access token.p  pThe problem in my mind is that resource permissions arent necessarily consistent across all routes, a route isnt necessarily going to have an ID in the same section of the URI, it might not have an ID in the URI at all, etc. etc. p  pMy current solution has been to have an authorization utility class that takes in an email and checks it against the user thats currently logged in token owner. p  precodeclass Authorization      checkResourcePermissionsemail           if loggedInUsergtemail  email               return true                        codepre  pObviously this is a simplification, but what this means is that since a route middleware wont have the context of a request until that request goes through I will need to call this authorization method inside of every API route, responding with an error if necessary, etc. Our API is fairly large, essentially boiling this down to a large amount of copy and paste which always makes me very nervous. p  pWhat am I missing  p

Positive 2051 pI would like users of my application to be able to create Roles dynamically and assign permissions to this roles. Therefor Roles model is not going to be hardcoded. Though, Permissions, as far as I understand do have to be hardcoded because Im going to hardcode theirs checks in application logicp  pThe best way I see is to keep Roles in database and create them on the fly and assign  unassign permissions. And Permissions should be kept in an array or hash, or associative array and should be changed only by developer and require server restart.p  pEverything seems to be fine, but I would like to read about some best practices of permission based authorization I can find a lot about Rolebased authorization, not Permission based and about any possible disadvantages.p  pAlso, I cant yet find the best way to manage levels of permissions. For example, I have permissions called Act As Admin, Manage Users, CreateReadUpdateDelete Userp  pI would like to let Role with permission of Act As Admin to do everything manager users, CRUD users etc. Role with permission of Manage Users  automatically can CRUD users. This approach is better because it wont require one to check a lot of OR conditions can act as adminm, or can manage users, or can CRUD user...p  pBut how should I keep Permissions hash array etc in memory for this purposesp  pI suppose, this question is language  framework  etc agnostic so I wont add such tagsp

Positive 2051 pI am developing an erp system using mvc5. i have my own membership system built and user and his user permission is kept in a session variable once a user logged in. Authorization part is almost done i suppose. But for authentication now im trying to restrict access for unauthenticated users. I tried it like thisp  pin my web.configp  precodeltauthentication modeFormsgt ltforms loginUrlLoginLogin timeout2880 gt ltauthenticationgt  codepre  pand on controllers i put [Authorize] attribute.p  pThis works fine for unauthenticated users. They are redirected to login page. But this restricts the access of authenticated users as well.This means neither unauthenticated nor authenticated user can access the controllers which has authorize attribute. p  pIf i remove authorize attribute it gives me an error since there is no user to be assigned to session variable. This implies that without authorize attribute unauthenticated user can access the controllers eventhough the web.config has been modified.p  pI think this involves creating a custom attribute. But i dont know how to approach this. All help appreciated. Thanks in advance p

Positive 2051 pI ran into a nasty problem on Monday.  I have a java client application that integrates with a thirdparty SaaS provider.  The integration was done in 20122013, so the team wrote a WSDL document, implemented the serverside of the web service in JavaScript and the providers framework, and then used Apache CXF 2.5.10 to generate client stubs, and all was well.  Until our team discovered a security issue with the SaaS provider, and decided we needed to set a security setting to require authorization for requests to the WSDL document.  After my client bounced, the integration was broken, and every request to the web service gets a 401 error message Caused by javax.wsdl.WSDLException WSDLException faultCodePARSERERROR Problem parsing a hrefhttpscompany.saasprovider.comSaasProviderTicketManager.doWSDL relnofollowhttpscompany.saasprovider.comSaasProviderTicketManager.doWSDLa. java.io.IOException Server returned HTTP response code 401 for URL a hrefhttpscompany.saasprovider.comSaasProviderTicketManager.doWSDL relnofollowhttpscompany.saasprovider.comSaasProviderTicketManager.doWSDLap  pThe SaaS provider was very helpful, monitoring things on the wire and identifying the issue as the request for the WSDL was not coming with authorization headers that were being sent when making the actual SOAP request.p  pHow do I tell CXF to add the authorization headers on the request for the WSDLp

Positive 2051 pUsing Spring Security 4.02, can anyone help with some tips on how I can handle codeUsernameNotFoundExceptioncode from codePreAuthenticatedAuthenticationProvidercode when using multiple codeAuthenticationProviderscode so that authenticated requests, with the correct header, but which are unauthorized, are sent to a specific URL instead of the formslogin pagep  pLet me explain further what Im trying to accomplish for accessing a web app being secured by SSO behind a proxy. Not all users who are authenticated by SSO will have access to this app. So I need to account for 3 access scenariosp  ol liauthenticated user header is present is authorized usernameroles are present in apps dbli liauthenticated user header is present is unauthorized usernameroles are strongnotstrong present in apps dbli liunauthenticated user with usernameroles present in apps dbli ol  pThe actions when accessing the website should bep  ol liauthenticatedauthorized user proceeds directly to target URLli liauthenticatedunauthorized user is redirected to errorinfo pageli liunauthenticated user is redirected to formslogin page for authenticationli ol  pWith my current configuration, scenarios 1 amp 3 appear to be working as desired. For scenario 2 Ive tried setting codeRequestHeaderAuthenticationFiltersetExceptionIfHeaderMissingcode to both true and false. p  pIf codesetExceptionIfHeaderMissingfalsecode, authenticatedunauthorized request is handled by codeExceptionTranslationFiltercode where codeAccessDeniedExceptioncode is thrown and user is redirected to formslogin page. p  pIf codesetExceptionIfHeaderMissingtruecode, authenticatedunauthorized request encounters codePreAuthenticatedCredentialsNotFoundExceptioncode from codeAbstractPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter.doAuthenticatecode and HTTP 500 is returned.p  pSo Ive read and reread the Spring Security reference and api documents and scoured the web and just cant quite figure out what I need to do. I think I somehow need to enable some kind of filter or handler to trap the codePreAuthenticatedCredentialsNotFoundExceptioncode with a redirected response. But I cant seem to wrap my head around how to implement that with all the spring tools available.

Negative 2051 pIm mostly familiar with Java, C and C in which there are ways to control that only one thread is accessing a resource at any given time. Now Im in search for something similar but in PHP 5.x.p  pTo formulate my problem with one examplep  pI have an ASCIIfile which only stores a number, the value of a page load counter. At application deployment the file will simply hold a 0. For each access the value will be incremented by one. The goal is to keep track of page loads.p  pThe problem comes when many users are concurrently accessing the page containing the counter. When thread A has read the current value, lets say it is 11, another thread which we call B reads the value, still 11. Then the first thread A increments the read value and writes 12 in the file and closes it. Then the second thread B, increments the read value, which was 11, gets 12 and writes that into the file. The value 12 is stored in the file, when it really should have been 13.p  pIn another programming language I would have solved this using a mutex.

The problems shows when I click on a different link thats supposed to hide the first div and show another. The text of the first div is hidden, but the image stays and obstructs the newly shown div.

Negative 2051 pI am working on a Firefox addon that will allow users all of whom are part of a specific group this addon is very limited in audience scope to see the status of their authentication cookie from the status bar. We all have to authenticate to access workrelated sites, but we get no warning when the cookie expires, so this causes annoying and sometimes drastic interrupts in workflow. Eventually, this add on will allow us to submit our credentials from the status bar without having to go to do any reloads or redirects, but for now, I just want to see it show the status.p  pI have been looking at the Mozilla developer pages at nsICookie, nsICookie2, nsICookieManager, etc, and it doesnt make very clear sense how any of it fits into javascript or XUL or anything else.p  pIdeally, Id just like a way for the javascript to go outside of the document and get the cookie string for a domain I specify.

Negative 2051 pOkay, Im still new to the whole ASP.NET and exactly how it posts back to its page.  But I was wondering if it leaves a trace of what content is currently on the page.  p  pFor example, if I have a Social Security text box, and wanted to encrypt it and ship it off to another server I would do that through a hidden server script after posting back to the current page via a submit button or something of the sort.  p  pThough if, when the page gets posted back to itself, it reveals the data. It becomes pointless to even encrypttransfer it somewhere safely if someone was listening or has access to your browser logs.p  pSo does posting back to the page keep the data secure, or does it open it up for easy access like a querystring would  And if it does not is there any secure way to get back to the server for the scripts therep
Negative 2051 pFor the downvote fairies.. I know that php is the wrong language for this... but I am working under outside constraints. Given thatp  pI have a large flat file that I need to process in php. I convert the flat file into a normalized database in mysql. There are several million lines in the flat file.p  pI originally tried to use an ORM system while importing the flat file. There was a massive php memory leak problem with that design even with careful freeing of objects. Even if I ensured that there was enough memory, the script would take about 25 days to run on my desktop. p  pI stripped out the overhead and rewrote the script to directly build mysql commands. I removed AUTO INCREMENT from my design since that required me to as Mysql what the last id entered was in order to make relations between data points. I just use a global counter for database ids instead and I never do any lookups, just inserts.p  pI use the unix split command to make lots of small files instead of one big one, because there is a memory overhead associated with using a file pointer again and again. p  pUsing these optimizations hope they help someone else I got the import script to run in about 6 hours. p  pI rented a virtual instance with 5 times more RAM and about 5 times more processor power than my desktop and noticed that it went exactly the same speed. The server runs the process but has CPU cycles and RAM to spare. Perhaps the limiting factor is disk speed. But I have lots of RAM.

Negative 2051 pIm working on a project that needs to authenticate users based on records in two different databases.  All administrators are stored locally and require full functionality to manage their accounts reset password, etc.  Regular users are authenticated against a different database used by another web app, so I only need to check that their credentials are correct.p  pAfter entering their usernamepass at the logon screen, my app should check if they exist in the local admins table.  If so, they are given the role of admin and allowed access. If not, it should then check the other apps user table and give them a user role if successful.p  pThe project is basically a large online book. Users simply need authentication to view it, rate the sections, and bookmark pages.  The ratingbookmark data will be associated with their unique id.

Their accounts will be managed with this admin area.p  pWhat is the best way to accomplish this in a .NET MVC application  By this, I mean integrating the logonauthentication system with both and assigning them a role based on which database confirms their credentials.p  pThanks in advancep

Each element does have an other distribution of these codeattributescode. This distribution is expressed through a positive integer value.

The sample sizes are about 15 categories from which each contains up to 30 elements, so bruteforcing doesnt seem to be very effective since there are potentially 3015 possibilities.p  pMy model is that I think of it as a tree with depth emnumber of categoriesem. Each depth level represents a category and gives us the choice of choosing an element out of this category. When passing over a node, we add the attributes of the represented element to our sum which we want to optimize. p  pIf we hit the same attribute combination multiple times on the same level, we merge them so that we can stripe away the multiple computation of already computed values.

Negative 2051 pI have a running 3D engine built in D3D via SlimDX. To avoid interupting the rendering pipeline I have batched together many objects with the same material into bigger meshes to reduce state switching. This have worked well and gives a good performance level for my need.p  pThe issue I am running into is that I, during runtime, need to change material properties on some subsets of those larger batched meshes. Im using the attribute buffer for that and it have been working reasonably well. I have been using a limited number of active attributes earlier ca 5 per mesh, but now find the need to have much more variations on the materials different shades of opacitycolorblends and thus ending up with possibly hundred or more combinations. And since those changes happens during runtime I cant bundle them together before rendering starts. Sure I could reconstruct meshes, but I rather not since it is slow and switching back and fourth between materials needs to be done at interactive speeds.p  pSo my question is, what is the best route to takep  ul lipShould i implement a more robust attribute handling system that dynamically masks faces with available attribute IDs on demand and then resets them when done I have heard that fragmentation in the attribute buffer generates added performance hit and I am also unsure about the performance hit of subsequent DrawSubset calls with material switches in between i.e when is too much and when should i optimize my attribute arrays. Anyone with any experience on thispli lipMy other idea is to use a parametrized pixel shader. I dont need any fancy effects, just the bare minimum current is the built in flatshader with color only and transparency on some objects, so shader model 1 is more than enough for my needs. The idea here is to use one allpurpose shader and instead of switching material between calls just alter some shader parameters. But I dont know if this is faster than switching materials andor if programmable shaders are slower than the build in ones given the same result.pli ul  pIm also curious about the difference in performance hit between switching mesh or drawing different subsets in one big mesh given the same number of material switches for both cases.p  pI understand that these questions might differ some between GFXcards and their respective performanceage but Im just looking for general guidelines here on what to focus most effort on i.e what type of state switchesCPUinterference that gives the biggest GPUhit. Memory is a concern also, so any implementations that duplicates whole or large parts of meshes are not possible for me. p  pMy focus is performance on older5yless capableintegrated GFX cards and not necessarily top of the line gamer cards or work station cards like Quadro. Which I guess could make or break the solution using shaders depending on how good the shader performance is on a particular board.p  pAny and all suggestions and feedback are greatly appreciated.p  pMany thanks in advancep

Negative 2051 pIn an Asp.net MVC application Id like to encapsulate the ugly wrapper code just a literal html opening string and another closing string we use to make corners and shadows compatible with older browsers we dont use javascript for performance reasons in a manner compatible with the visual studio design view.  p  pId like to put the wrapper divs in a control so that I can use them in a .aspx view page and not have to look at all the mess required to make fancy corners amp shadows but still get the benefit of seeing the results in the designer.p  p open wrapper literal  actual content close wrapper literalp  pI couldnt figure out how to inject content inside 1 control and have the results visible in the designer the way master pages do, so Im testing a system using 2 controls containing the literal html.p  pstrongexample usage  with one control opening and another closingstrongp  precodeltShadowBoxStart gt contains div open tags Hello World. This is actual content with all the nice style divs wrapped around ltShadowBoxEnd gt contains div close tags codepre  pThis renders properly in all browsers when I run the application but the designer seems to be confused by the fact that one control opens the divs and another closes them and renders junk.  The System.Web.Mvc.ViewUserControls Im using contain nothing but literal html, and Ive replicated the behavior with several different standard style amp div configurations so Im stumped as to what is confusing the designer. p  pId like to keep the solution really simple because this is mainly a convenience setup and not worth a lot of added complexity.

How would one need to do the query I can not put yet another trycatch around that one When would I stopp  pI want only the changed values to be put in the database.p  pEDIT let me rephrase the intent of the question  When I say ResolveALLkeepchanges, I would think that I say I dont care..just use my values. Instead, it throws yet again the same exception.p  pI was surprised by this behaviour since the examples on MSDN dont have a second try catch around the second SubmitChangesp  pSo how many times can these exceptions be thrownAs many times as there are columns, and can I avoid them altogether somehow after saying ResolveAllp  pEDIT  Last edit before I start the bountyp  pIve made it into a neat loop as suggested by 1 of the commenters. But it doesnt matter how many times I retry. The moment it starts throwing exceptions, it will never do it without an exception So either it works the first time, or it wont work at all.p  pNow my linq update has some 20 or 50 rows in it which need updating I work with batches to speed things up.  Is every resolveall only fixing one issue in 1 column ion 1 row or is it smart enough to fix everything it encounteredp  pTo recap the values I just changed only 1 or 2 columns are the ones which need to go into the database no matter what.

So I could resolve as much as I liked, every time the trigger would fire again, causing the next conflict. p  pThis trigger obviously I was not aware off, since my DB admin put it in place there to track something or the other. Triggers can be a great tool, but if you are not aware of them they can cause major headachesp

Negative 2051 pI receive a daily XML file that contains thousands of records, each being a business transaction that I need to store in an internal database for use in reporting and billing. I was under the impression that each days file contained only unique records, but have discovered that my definition of unique is not exactly the same as the providers. p  pThe current application that imports this data is a C.Net 3.5 console application, it does so using SqlBulkCopy into a MS SQL Server 2008 database table where the columns exactly match the structure of the XML records. Each record has just over 100 fields, and there is no natural key in the data, or rather the fields I can come up with making sense as a composite key end up also having to allow nulls. Currently the table has several indexes, but no primary key.p  pBasically the entire row needs to be unique. If one field is different, it is valid enough to be inserted. I looked at creating an MD5 hash of the entire row, inserting that into the database and using a constraint to prevent SqlBulkCopy from inserting the row,but I dont see how to get the MD5 Hash into the BulkCopy operation and Im not sure if the whole operation would fail and roll back if any one record failed, or if it would continue.p  pThe file contains a very large number of records, going row by row in the XML, querying the database for a record that matches all fields, and then deciding to insert is really the only way I can see being able to do this. I was just hoping not to have to rewrite the application entirely, and the bulk copy operation is so much faster.p  pDoes anyone know of a way to use SqlBulkCopy while preventing duplicate rows, without a primary key Or any suggestion for a different way to do thisp

It doesnt, because for some reason its pointer was freed, but not reassigned it is still pointing to the same address it was first allocated which is now freed. Freds pointer, however, has the allocated value 7 in a different memory location.p  pWhy is it behaving like this What am I minsunderstanding How can I make it work like C doesp  pEdit Right, a fresh morning and I can see I gave a really bad, 5pm syndrome example. What Im trying to do is more like thisp  precodeinterface classOne  NSObject      int numA  property int numA  implementation...etc codepre  pnumA is alloced and assigned a value.

I realise that it shouldnt be a pointer, but the float buffer for the coordinates is dealt with in the same way and needs to be of variable size, so I want to fix this to solve that problem also.p

Negative 2051 pI have a RichTextBox control on my form. The control is setup in such a way that it will wrap to the next line after 32 lines of text are input. The problem Im having is I want to be able to retreive an array of strings representing the lines in my control. I know there is a Lines property attached to the RichTextBox, but I am experiencing 2 issues with itp  p1 I ONLY want an array of strings showing the lines that are visible on the screen only. Right now the Lines array returns every single line in the RichTextBox. I only want the lines visible on the screen returned.p  p2 The Lines property is not giving me a true representation of my lines. It counts a line as a line of text ended by a carriage return or n. So in other words, if I type 64 characters and none of them are a carriage return, then it should return 2 lines because there are 32 characters per line. Instead, it doesnt return any lines until I hit enter. Even then, it only returns 1 line, not 2. Its acting more like a Paragraph property, if there was such a thing. p  pAnyone know a way around these 2 issuesI am using C btwp

Im not even sure if it would work.p  pAlso I have contemplated using the setToolTip method to display the timer countdown.  But that seems to be the same as the setTitle method.  Once it is set, you cant change it till you release the NSStatusItem object and create a new one.  p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.p  pThank youp  pDavep

Negative 2051 h2Psssst...h2  pRead on, by all means.  But I can tell you here that the problem had nothing to do with the DataContext, but with Dependency Injection.  I have left the question up, as it documents one possible issue with the row not found or changed error that has nothing to do with real world concurrency conflicts.p  pIt seems the problems have been caused by badly written dependency injection.  Or rather, I am beginning to believe, by default lifecycle management by the DI container I used.  p  pThe problem was that I used a DataContext as a constructor argument that was supplied by Ninject.  It seems that the default behaviour was to cache this DataContext, leading to all manner of unexpected behaviour.  I will ask a separate question about this.p  pAnyway, what follows is my original question, which as you will see, misses the real cause of the issue by a mile...p  h2The Problemh2  pI am getting a number of errors that imply that the DataContext, or rather, the way I am using the DataContext is getting out of synch.p  pThe error occurs on db.SubmitChanges where db is my DataContext instance.

This works fine when the characters are in the Latin1 character set.

I do not know what the default encoding is in this case. It appears that it is not UTF8.p  pOn the java side, httpServletRequest.getCharacterEncoding shows null.

By sorting I would most likely make each piece of data an object of some particular class, thus creating a class hierarchy. The objects would have to be persistent, of course.

Negative 2051 pIve noticed a distinct lack of LL parsers that create parsers in functional languages. The ideal find for what Ive been looking for without success is something to generate a Haskell parser for an ANTLRstyle LL grammar modulo minor reformatting of the grammar, and was surprised that every last parser generator with a functional language target I found was some kind of LR parser.p  pI want to transition the parser of this language Im working on which has functional features from ANTLR to selfhost in the language itself, and it would help a lot if I could port to my language something almost surely correct in another functional language preferably ones Im familiar with, Haskell and Scala, instead of having to rewrite it entirely from scratch, though in the end I might do this, since the core language is small.p  pAt this point more than even a solution to this is Im very curious as to emwhyem there are no such LL or even LLk parser generators, but many LR generators, since LL seems inherently easier.p

Negative 2051 pI am having trouble developing some queries on the fly for our clients and sometimes find myself asking Would it be better to start with a subset of the data I know Im looking for, then just import into a program like Excel and process the data accordingly using similar functions, such as Pivot Tables.p  pOne instance in particular I am struggling with is the following examplep  pI have an online member enrollment system. For simplicity sake, lets assume the data captured is Member ID, Sign Up Date, their referral code, their state.p  pA sample member table may look like the followingp  precodeMemberID   Date    Ref     USState  1          20110101   abc    AL 2          20110102   bcd    AR 3          20110103   cde    CA 4          20110201   abc    TX codepre  pand so on....p  pultimately, the types of queries I want to build and run with this data set can extend to Show me a list of all referral codes and the number of sign ups they had by each month in a single result set.p  pFor examplep  precodeRef    201101  201102  201103  201104  abc      1        1        0       0 bcd      1        0        0       0 cde      1        0        0       0 codepre  pI have no idea how to build this type of query in MySQL to be honest I imagine if it can be done it would require a LOT of code, joins, subqueries, and unions.p  pSimilarly, another sample query may be how many members signed up in each state by monthp  precodeUSState   201101  201102  201103  201104  AL     1        0        0       0 AR     1        0        0       0 CA     1        0        0       0 TX     0        1        0       0 codepre  pI suppose my question is two foldp  p1 Is it in fact best to just try and build these out with the necessary data from within a MySQL GUI such as Navicat or just import the entire subset of data into Excel and work forwardp  p2 If I was to use the MySQL route, what is the proper way to build the subsets of data in the examples mentioned below note that the queries could become far more complex such as Show how many sign ups came in for each particular month by each state and grouped by each agent as well each agent has 50 possible rowsp  pThank you so much for your assistance ahead of time.p

Negative 2051 pIm using a mechanism to pass bootstrapping information embedded in the host page which is a servletjsp combination from the server to the client. The bootstrapping information contains vital information that is required during client start up which saves one clientserver round trip and therefore speeds up application start up.p  pIm using Gson to serialize the bootstrapping information and inject it directly into a  tag in the host page. The information is accessed on the client using a hrefhttpcode.google.comwebtoolkitdoclatestDevGuideCodingBasicsOverlay.html relnofollowJS Overlay Typesa. Because passing long values from JS to Java isnt supported by GWT Im using a custom JsonSerializer which turns all longsLongs into Strings.p  pAll of this works fine but it is a little fragile. Therefore Id love to verify the correct behavior in an integration test which covers both the server and the client side components. This is where I ran into trouble Gson used in the server side component isnt GWT compatible and JS Overlay Types obviously arent Java compatible.p  pMy question is Is it possible to write a GWTTestCase which runs some parts of the code as pure Java ie. on the integrated server If not, do you have any other recommendations on how to test thisp  pThanks a lot Michaelp

Negative 2051 pI have some data I have to show through two JTables the data is the same, but each table will have to show it a little differently. Also, I receive the data from an external connection JMS in this case, but it doesnt really matter, it could be a DB, or whatever.p  pBeing that I am new to Swing, I am still a little confused about who should fire the events, who should listen to them and how to make so that for a modification to my dataset I will have both the tables to update.p  pNow, a little example of my dataset structure as well as some dummy datap  precodeclass Student String name Classroom classroom boolean goodStudent class Classroom Sting name ListltStringgt coursesTaught ListltStudentgt students  public ListltClassroomgt classes codepre  pBasically, my dataset will be the codeclassescode field in a Controller class and the two JTables will have to show things in different ways.

What I would like to do is that, when my data changes, the tables will automatically update too. For what I understood so far, I will have to subclass AbstractTableModel and create two different TableModels for the kind of data I want to show what I dont get isp  ul liHow will the Models get their data, once some change happensli liWho should notify the models of this changeli liIs it enough to call fireTableXXXEvent to trigger the view refreshli ul  pI hope I made myself clear enough...

Negative 2051 pI am creating a networking library in C that I can use in any application, and as part of this library I have a TCP clientserver setup. This setup works perfectly in almost every situation it connects, sendsreceives data, and disconnects flawlessly when under minimal and medium stress loads. However, when I send large amounts of data from the client to the server, the client socket works for a varied amount of time sometimes short, sometimes long and then just refuses to send data for a while. Specifically, my data rate goes from the 550750 KBps range to 0 KBps, and sits there for again a varied amount of time. Then the socket will start sending again for a very short time, and get throttled again. During the throttling, i was assuming that the socket was disconnected because I couldnt send anything, but Polling returns that the socket IS connected using this code p  precode public bool IsConnectedSocket socket       try                return socket.Poll1, SelectMode.SelectRead  socket.Available  0            catch SocketException  return false   codepre  pI just took a networking class at my college, so I started thinking about the congestion control and flow control mechanisms in TCP, but it seems to me that neither would cause this problem congestion control only slows the data rate, and a full buffer on the receivers side wouldnt last nearly the length of time I am getting a 0 KBps data rate. The symptom seems to point towards either some type of heavy data throttling or mass scale dropping of packets. p  pMy question is this strongdoes anyone have any idea what might be causing this data throttling, for lack of a better term Also, is it possible that the packets I send are going further than just my router even though they are addressed to a host in the same subnetstrongp  pEdit Just so it is clear, the reason I am trying to fix this problem is because I want to send files over TCP at the highest possible data rate. I understand that UDP can be used as well, and I will also be making a solution using it, but I want TCP to work first.p  pSpecific Informationp  pI am using blocking readwrite operations, and the server is multithreaded. The client runs on its own thread as well. I am testing on my local subnet, bouncing all packets through my router, which should have a throughput of 54 Mbps. The packets are 8 KB each in size, and at maximum would be sent 1000 times a second sending thread sleeps 1 ms, but obviously are not reaching that rate. Reducing the size of the packets so the data rate is lower causes the throttling to disappear. Windows 7 machines, 1 server, 1 client. The send operation always completes, it is the receive operation that errors out. p  pThe send operation is belowp  precode get a copy of all the packets currently in the queue

Negative 2051 pI am writing an Android application that does much of a processing in the background thread. The calculations are performed in the native code using C. I want to update UI with the partial results during calculations.p  pI am able to do so through JNI, namely set reference to UI object in java and then call a method of this object from native code trough JNI. I am looking for a more efficient solution without any JNI calls in the rendering part the basic setup and an activation entry point will have to be in java.p  pIs it possible to change execution thread from background to UI entirely in native code without using JNI only in the rendering partp  pThanks for your answers. Much appreciated. p  pstrongEDITstrong I am considering using OpenGL to render calculated content sort of video frames in my view. In that case I would probably want to use codeeglSwapBufferscode method that is available in EGL library from 2.3 onwards.

There are couple of ways to call the codeupdateGLcode method above. The most typical one is to use codeGLSurfaceViewcode in java code. It would require setting a renderer a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidopenglGLSurfaceView.htmlsetRenderer28android.opengl.GLSurfaceView.Renderer29 titlesetRenderer4041setRenderera and then overriding a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidopenglGLSurfaceView.Renderer.htmlonDrawFrame28javax.microedition.khronos.opengles.GL1029onDrawFramea with some code to call JNInative layer. This way for every frame being rendered one JNI call gets executed. p  pI would like to do the rendering a little differently. I want to call codeupdateGLcode without using javaJNI code at all and use only the native layer as presented in the excerpt above. The biggest problem for me now is how to run the codeupdateGLcode on UI thread required by OpenGL without the java callback. Is it at all feasible p

Negative 2051 pI am trying to write a script that will manipulate some data for me in an xml file.  I am pretty new to VBScript but have a VB.NET and VBA background, so I feel like I kind of know what I am doing.p  pI thought there is probably a better way to navigate the file rather than a lot of calling InStr or similar for each line to see if what I am looking for is there.  My initial idea was to use a few methods I have seen in VB.NET from System.XML, since I had seen node navigating functions and members in that.p  pAfter investigating this, I cannot find any way to import a namespace System.XML, or otherwise into VBScript without it running on a webpage.  I decided to look for other options instead of spending more time searching for this.p  pTurns out there are other ways to do what I want, using methods and objects that specifically deal with navigating nodes of an XML file.  I learned that some common examples of these systems for lack of a better term, because I am sure that is improper seem to be DOM and XPath.p  pI started by investigating XPath since I had seen XPath deemed superior to DOM in a few places, such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1908526traversingallnodesinanxmlfilewithvbscriptTraversing all nodes in an XML file with VBScripta.  I could not find anything to discribe the basics of XPath in vbscript. There is lots on the syntax for paths and such, but I could find nothing that describes the very basics of how to actually call that syntax in VBScript to make use of it.  So I moved on to the next option.p  pI then found many slightly different articlesquestionsetc about DOM.  So I gave it a try.  Not a single one of them worked, all gave me errors.  Mostly, it just seemed that a DOM object is never loaded correctly.  Here are just a few of the methods I have tried for thisp  pFrom a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa468547.aspxMSDN a beginners guide to XML DOMap  precodeSet objParser  CreateObject Microsoft.XMLDOM  Dim xDoc As MSXML.DOMDocument Set xDoc  New MSXML.DOMDocument  If xDoc.LoadCMy Documentscds.xml Then    msgboxSuccess Else    msgboxFailure End If codepre  pThis returned failure every time.p  pa hrefhttpwww.webdeveloper.comforumshowthread.phpt10172Based on another methodap  precodedim xmlDom set xmlDom  createobjectMSXML2.DOMDocument xmlDom.async  false xmlDom.load CMyFileLocationMyFile.xml codepre  pand then I tried a few things to detect if it worked like message boxes for each node name in xmlDom.documentElement.p  pI have tried so many other things I cant even remember most of them.p  pI simply dont know what more I can try or why this isnt working for me. I am simply at a loss for what more I can try differently while still having syntax that COULD work.p  pSo my question is How can I navigate an XML file using VBScript without the script being imbedded in a webpage or otherwise  I need to know the extreme basics.p  pI know my question likely seems stupid and ignorant since this should be easily available information, but I really cannot for the life of me find the basics I need to understand how to navigate nodes in ANY WAY using JUST VBScript not in an html or asp file or something like that. p

What we are going to store is generally documents usually around 100K but occasionally can be much larger or smaller annotated with some metadata. Query performance is not top priority.

Negative 2051 pWithin my various projects I implement the commandquery separation pattern and use NHibernate as my ORM.p  pIn general I keep my commands and queries in separate projects relevant to the particular set of activities such as codeUserManagementcode, codeTagManagementcode, codeQuestionManagementcode etc.p  pI quite like having everything divided up nicely into these repositories with easily findable functionality.

Negative 2051 pIm using a hrefhttpwww.barelyfitz.comprojectstabber relnofollowthis script here called tabbera to make tabs on my pages to divide up my content. Specifically, Im using the tabber script on my Mediawiki pages via a hrefhttpwww.mediawiki.orgwikiExtension3aTabber relnofollowthis wonderful plugina.p  pHowever, the problem Im having is that when you first load any page with the tabs on it, the tabs are fully expanded, then contract to hide the content of the tabs that shouldnt be showing. This causes the page to jump all around until it has fully loaded, which makes the pages look like an absolute mess. You probably wont see this in the examples on the page above, as the tabs barely have any content in them. If you load the tabs with a bunch of content, as well as content around them, the problem starts to happen.p  pIn some tab scripts Ive seen on the Internet, this doesnt happen. When you load the pages. Nothing moves at all and it seems that when you click the tabs, the content loads for the first time rather than just loading everything at once and then hiding the contents of the inactive tabs. I would like to know if its possible to modify the Javascript or PHP for the tabber code above so that nothing jumps around  so that when you load the page, you just see the contents of the first tab and then the other tabs either load their own content when you click them or are just loaded with the page but dont just show and then contract. I have extremely limited knowledge with PHP and Javascript, and have been trying to experiment with this problem by comparing the tabber script to other scripts out there in Notepad, but Im just not having any luck figuring out what to change.p  pThank you so much in advance I greatly appreciate any help at all p  pEDIT I forgot to mention that a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumfromgroupstopicbarelyfitzJqZi3D9iB4 relnofollowsomeone on Tabbers Google groupa came up with a solution several years ago, but I wasnt able to get it working when I tried it this week.

Negative 2051 pIm trying to create a design blog and gallery for myself and thats why Im being a bit experimental with CSS3. I achieved the result I wanted for other browsers and now IE is giving me a headache.p  pI created rotated date markers for my blog posts with CSS like thisp  precode.metadata  marginleft 108px margintop 140px width 140px position absolute textalign right    .postdate  display block  Safari  webkittransform rotate90deg  Firefox  moztransform rotate90deg  Opera  otransform rotate90deg fontsize 70px color ffffff  codepre  pOkay, how I did it is probably not so important. Anyway I tried rotating the text in IE as well, and I managed to do it with the IEspecific code, but the rendered result was simply so awful that I didnt want to use it. And now, without the rotate code and such, the date markers are naturally nowhere near where they should be in IE.p  pI wished to create a completely different look for the date markers in IE using conditional CSS, but Im not sure how, my first time trying anything like that.p  precodelt[if IE ]gt ltlink relstylesheet hrefiecss.css  typetextcss mediascreengt lt[endif]gt codepre  pIn that iecssfile I included the same CSS classes with slightly different rules at first I only tried to drop the font size by 50 pixels. I only have IE 8 on my computer, and it had absolutely no effect there. I previewed my website with IE NetRenderer which implied the text size change emdid workem in IE 7 well, actually in IE 6 too, but Im reluctant to talk about the other things that happened to the design.p  pSo why didnt it do anything in IE 8 and according to the NetRenderer IE 9 I also tried using [if gte IE 8] but it didnt do anything either.p  pIs the problem that when IE understands the rules in the main CSS file and has no trouble displaying the result like it should be, it cannot override the effect with new CSS rules for the same classesp  pIs there a way to make all versions of IE completely ignore those CSS rules and follow others which would make the date marker look completely different in IE Or, is there a way to tell IE not to show the date marker at all Since my site is just quite experimental to begin with, it would be no big deal not to show post dates in IE. Can PHP do the latter for mep

I want the user to press the image to click the button instead of them pressing a blank spot on the button and still clicking the button. p  pIs there a way to make the clickable area of am image button match a random shaped imagep

Negative 2051 pAccording to the a hrefhttpwww.rubydoc.orgcore1.9.3Hash.htmlmethodistorespecificationa, strings that are used as a key to a hash are duplicated and frozen. Other mutable objects do not seem to have such special consideration. For example, with an array key, the following is possible.p  precodea  [0] h  a gt a h.keys.first[0]  1 h  gt [1] gt a h[[1]]  gt nil h.rehash h[[1]]  gt a codepre  pOn the other hand, a similar thing cannot be done with a string key.p  precodes  a h  s gt s h.keys.first.upcase  gt RuntimeError cant modify frozen String codepre  pWhy is string designed to be different from other mutable objects when it comes to a hash key Is there any use case where this specification becomes useful What other consequences does this specification havep  phr I actually have a use case where absence of such special specification about strings may be useful. That is, I read with the codeyamlcode gem a manually written YAML file that describes a hash. the keys may be strings, and I would like to allow case insensitivity in the original YAML file. When I read a file, I might get a hash like thisp  precodeh  foo gt foo, Bar gt bar, BAZ gt baz codepre  pAnd I want to normalize the keys to lower case to get thisp  precodeh  foo gt foo, bar gt bar, baz gt baz codepre  pby doing something like thisp  precodeh.keys.eachampdowncase codepre  pbut that returns an error for the reason explained above.p

Negative 2051 pWhen using CodeNarc for static code analysis on Groovy amp Grails code, it is not able to figure out class hierarchies. There is a private method in one service class say BaseService. Another service class say ChildService extends the BaseService class. One of the methods in the ChildService calls a private method defined in the BaseService. But the BaseService class  does not use the private method anywhere in its own class. So when analyzing the BaseService class in isolation, the private method will appear as unused. But when we look at the class hierarchy, we can understand one of its subclass is calling it.br So, my question is, how does CodeNarc miss that kind of dependency Doesnt static code analyzers build parse tree and analyze on it If not how does it analyze code Any insight into the internals of static code analysis is highly appreciated.br Thanks. p
Negative 2051 pI am using a UIImagePickerController to allow the user to upload a photo for use in my application. After selecting a photo to upload, the user is then prompted to crop hisher photo since I have set codeimagePickerController.allowsEditing  YEScode. However, if the photo is landscape i.e., wider than it is taller, it is currently possible for the user to crop the photo in a way that does not output a square image. This is because the default zoom level when cropping landscape photos is aspectFit rather than aspectFill as it is for portrait photos.p  pIs it possible to set the minimum zoom level for UIImagePickerControllers edit mode I suppose I could simply automatically crop the image if the output is not square, but I would rather that the edit mode of UIImagePickerController convey this to the user instead of doing it for himher.p

The javascript code only receives the keypress data if I am focused in a text field.p  pIs there some way around this I would like to read the keypresses on tablets without having to be focused in a text field.p

The author uses what I consider to be arbitrary symbols for his operators though I dont know what operators are ordinary. Im used to C , ampamp, and  operators for the NOT, AND, and OR operations respectively. Theres typos and other things in the ebook which make it more difficult to read.p  pThe point being, is that chapter absolutely necessary to learn Are there any beginners x64 assembly programming books out there This computer has an AMD 64 bit processor.

Negative 2051 pI have an app uses IAP and has been thru a few editions. The other day, I accidentally clicked the button for hosting content with apple, and I found I could not undo this. Worse thing is that I could not test the IAP in sandbox environment UNLESS I upload the content. I remember there was a lucky guy posted here saying that he had such situation and Apple removed the option for him after he wrote apple. However, I dont have such luck. I wrote and called apple to request removal of the flag. After 3week waiting and handful phone calls, I got the answer saying that flagging hosting content option is not reversible. I guess I have to go other way, but I have question and uncertainty, along the steps I can do.p  p1, Im planning to upload a 1line text file with the IAP.  Is this finep  p2, This is the first I make a .pkg file. I downloaded PackageMaker, and dropped the 1line file to its window and I made a pkg, also followed installation guide and installed it  but I could not find where it is installed I chose Mac HD.... Question is Is this alright A text file becomes a installation packagep  p3, I guess in normal situation, when users buy IAP with content, the app should handle the downloaded packagecontent.pkg and open and install it, right In my case, I just ignore the downloading step and content. No code need to be added to my current IAPhandling script, is this okayp  p4, I will use Application Loader to load the package for the given IAP. The first time for me too. Any oftenmade mistakes that I can learn and avoid before I actually do thisp  pThank you very much your inputp

Negative 2051 pHello beautiful people,p  pIm a total newbi in general gui and qt, and am kind of stuck. I downloaded the slider example a hrefhttpqt.gitorious.orgpysidepysideexamplesblobsblamece9b2dfe456f38a166314dc2807a6b27cd944127exampleswidgetssliders.py relnofollowfrom herea [qt.gitorious.org] and sobered it down to just the sliders. The code Ive got right now is as follows a hrefhttppastebin.comEkXxdPee relnofollowhttppastebin.comEkXxdPeeap  pI now want to read the values from the slider and do stuff with it send it over to another program using zeromq. I guess I have to do something with valueChanged, but I have no clue what. Could anybody help me out a little bitp  pAll tips are welcomep  p[EDIT] Thanks to the answer of Romha Korev and some googling I found a full working example here a hrefhttpzetcode.comguipysidetutorialwidgets relnofollowhttpzetcode.comguipysidetutorialwidgetsap  pI simply worked from there and I finally have what I want now. Thanksp
Negative 2051 pI use PyGTKs codegtk.TreeViewcode and codegtk.TreeViewColumncode to build lists with multiple columns. For the columns I want to render standard headers, but stacked on top another row of headers spanning multiple columns. See this illustrationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comF67wo.png altStacked column headersp  pUnlike column headers 1 to 4, the stacked headers dont need to have any sorting capability. They just need to contain a label. When one of the default headers headers 14 are resized, I want the stacked headers to resize with them so that they stay aligned.p  pIs this possible with GTK If so, howp

Negative 2051 pI am in the process of creating a category for the class MKPolygon. You can find the reference to this class a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationMapKitReferenceMKPolygonclassReferenceReference.html relnofollowherea. I have two public class methods that I want to make public and a handful of private methods to handle some of the internals. The reason I want to do this is because, as you can see, the methods available for this class are class methods and I want to continue with being in line with this by offering class methods which will both be returning MKPolygon . Also, there will be a lot of work that I will be writing and not breaking up the tasks would go against good coding practices and of course hard to test and read  this is especially important as I will be contributing this to github. p  pHere is my header and implementation file that was created when creating a new category in XCode. I am going to make the methods generic for now to get my point acrossp  pMKPolygonMKPolygonStuff.hp  precodeimport ltMapKitMapKit.hgt  interface MKPolygon MKPolygonStuff   MKPolygon polygonMKPolygon poly1 doStuffMKPolygon poly2 onMapMKMapView map BOOLpolygonMKPolygon poly1 doesThisThingMKPolygon poly2  end codepre  pMKPolygonMKPolygonStuff.mp  precodeinterface MKPolygon     voidcalculateStuff  end  implementation MKPolygon MKPolygonStuff  voidcalculateStuff     MKPolygon polygonMKPolygon poly1 doStuffMKPolygon poly2 onMapMKMapView map    do stuff and call other class methods to break up tasks   [self calculateStuff]     BOOLpolygonMKPolygon poly1 doesThisThingMKPolygon poly2      returns boolean     possibly call other class methods do some internals.  codepre  pIn my implmentation file my interface had something within the parenthesis but it gave me the following warning p  blockquote   pDuplicate definition of category on interface...p blockquote  pSo i decided that i would just leave the parenthesis empty after reading a couple of other threads in here regarding this issue. Also doing this would allow me to have instance variables that I will most definitely need that I dont want to be made public. p  pNow I have a warning that is located under the implementation section next to voidcalculateStuff. p  blockquote   pCategory is implementing a method which will also be implemented by   its primary class.p blockquote  pI searched this warning around the net to see what would cause this warning and it seems that you would get this warning if the compiler recognizes that you will be overriding some built in functionality to the class. The thing is, is that there isnt a calculateStuff method in the MKPolygon class, so I am unsure why i am getting this warning. Is there something here that I am doing wrong, if anything and generally, do I have everything set up right here with that I want to do Obviously, my private methods have to be class methods as well since you cant call instance methods from class methods. p  pWould appreciate any commentssuggestionscorrections here.p

Negative 2051 pI have on my website a simple form where the user enters personal information to register as a new user.p  pMy problem is that in some cases the postal code allows illegal characters even though i have  a JavaScript validation on the onkeyup event of my inputtag. This doesnt happen often but still happens.p  pIn Sweden the standard postal code is a 5 digit number and my validation checks for input of illegal characters and then in my submit validation checks against the length before allowing submit of the form.p  pExample codep  precodefunction checkPostal    document.RegisterForm.Postal.value  document.RegisterForm.Postal.value.replace[09]g,   if document.RegisterForm.Postal.value.length  clientProfileFieldPostalnrMax        document.RegisterForm.Postal.classNameClientprofileFieldOK     codepre  pcodePostalnrMaxcode is code5code for this example.p  pThe way you normally write a postal code in Sweden is codeXYZ ABcode.p  pMy problem is that some of my users postal codes are written to the database as codeXYZ Acode. In the three last occurrences, the users have been using Chrome. Ive tried to recreate the problem but have been unsuccessful. Im assuming that the problem is that the users somehow enter their postal code as you normally would codeXYZ ABcode and my validation against length cuts off the last character.p  pSo my question is, how are the users able to enter a faulty postal code When i try it, it replaces space immediately with codecode. Has it something to do with Chrome autofillp

Note, WMTOUCH was already tried but did not provide the needed performance.p  pI got RAWINPUT working, so a device is registered and receives messages for touch events in a raw format of 63 bytes.  How can this vendorspecific raw input data for those events be converted  mapped into vendorindependent data in order to retrieve the touch points coordinates safely for different device typesp  pThere must be a generic way to map that raw data to structured information.

Negative 2051 pSummary  I have a web control that is dynamically added to the page.  The control has a HiddenField child control.  I am passing the controls ClientID to a jquery widget that is setting the value to a string json converted to string.  When the form is posted back to the server, the value of the HiddenField is a blank string.  I value is in the Request.Form[emUniqueIDem] object.  The value is making it back to the server.  The problem is that, I dont have access to the Request object when I need the value without modifying a lot of legacy code.p  pThe strange thing is that the selectmany control is the one I am having a problem with, but it inherits from the SelectOne that is working properly. I think I am doing something wrong in the selectmany class because even if I try to push a value into the SelectOneHiddenValue it does not work ,but it works properly when the SelectOne uses it.p  pSelectOnep  precode[ToolboxDatalt0SelectOne runatservergtlt0SelectOnegt] public class SelectOne  Panel, IControl,ISelectOne      region structure      private readonly Panel selectOneTextboxContainer  new Panel     protected readonly TextBox SelectOneTextbox  new TextBox     protected readonly HiddenField SelectOneHiddenValue  new HiddenField     private readonly Panel selectOneDropdownImageContainer  new Panel     private readonly Image selectOneDropDownImage  new Image      endregion      private readonly IListltLookupItemgt selectedItems  new ListltLookupItemgt      region properties     public IListltLookupItemgt SelectedItems  get  return selectedItems        public bool MultiSelect  get set      public DisplayOption Display  get set      public string Name  get set       [DefaultValue0]     public int LookupValueOrgID              get                      EnsureChildControls             return Convert.ToInt32String.IsNullOrEmptySelectOneHiddenValue.Value  0  SelectOneHiddenValue.Value                   set                      EnsureChildControls             SelectOneHiddenValue.Value  value.ToString                    [Bindabletrue]     [CategoryAppearance]     [DefaultValue]     [Localizabletrue]     public string Text              get                      EnsureChildControls             return SelectOneTextbox.Text                   set                      EnsureChildControls             SelectOneTextbox.Text  value                     ltsummarygt      The minimum number of characters a user has to type before the autocompleter activates.      ltsummarygt     [Bindabletrue]     [CategoryAppearance]     [DefaultValue1]     [Localizabletrue]     public int MinChars              get                      int b  ViewState[MinChars]  null  1  intViewState[MinChars]             return b                  set                      ViewState[MinChars]  value                     ltsummarygt      The number of backend query results to store in cache.

Negative 2051 precodesampledict  i.year [1997, 1997], i.month [March, April], j.month [March, April], j.year [1997, 2003] codepre  pHow do we compare each element in i.year and j.year, and if the elements are equal to each other, than delete the element at that index in the value at each key and than move on to the next element and continue the process. The length of each value will always be the same. emWith no use of importsemp  pSo basically what Im trying to say is thisp  pFor the sake of this question compare just the elements in i.year and j.yearp  precodegt i.year [1997, 1997], i.month [March, April], j.month [March, April], j.year [1997, 2003] gt The first element in i.year is equal to the first element in j.year, so delete the first element in each value in every key. codepre  pWe getp  precodegt i.year [1997], i.month [April], j.month [April], j.year [2003] gt The element now in i.year and j.year is the same so were done. Return that dictionary codepre  pAnother examplep  precodegt i.year [1997, 1997, 2009], i.month [March, April, June], j.month [March, April, June], j.year [1997, 2003, 2010] gt The first element in i.year is equal to the first element in j.year, so delete the first element in each value in every key. codepre  pWe getp  precodegt i.year [1997, 2009], i.month [April, June], j.month [April, June], j.year [2003, 2010] gt Now the first element in i.year and j.year are different so we move to the next element which is 2009 and 2010 gt 2009 and 2010 are different so we move to the next element, since theres none we are done. Return that dictionary. codepre  pLast examplep  precodegt i.year [1996, 1997, 2010], i.month [March, April, June], j.month [March, April, June], j.year [1997, 2003, 2010] gt The first element in i.year is not equal to the first element in j.year, so we move on to the next element. gt 1997 does not equal to 2003 so we move on to the next element gt 2010 is equal to 2010 so we delete each element in every key at the index codepre  pWe getp  precodegt i.year [1996, 1997], i.month [March, April], j.month [March, April], j.year [1997, 2003] gt There are no more elements to move on to, so we are done, we return this dictionary. codepre  pI have this idea but cant turn it into python codep  pFor every element in i.month loop through every element in j.year, and if the elements are not equal loop through the entire dictionary and remove the element at that index.p

Negative 2051 pFor some reason I had my made my mind a while back on an EF 6 project that I would try to avoid naming foreign keys. I defined much of the model without testing it incrementally and so I have been running into multiplicity and incomplete Fluent API definition issuesp  blockquote   pA relationship from the UserInternalAuth AssociationSet is in the   Deleted state. Given multiplicity constraints, a corresponding   UserInternalAuthTarget must also in the Deleted state.p blockquote  pIn one case, here is the codep  precodenModelBuilder.EntityltUsergt     .HasOptionalltInternalAuthgtu gt u.InternalAuth     .WithRequireda gt a.User     .WillCascadeOnDeletetrue codepre  pMy understanding is that it is sayingp  ul liThe entity codeUsercodeli liHas an optional property codeInternalAuthcode of type codeInternalAuthcodeli liOn the other end, codeInternalAuthcode has a required property codeUsercode, so that emallem codeInternalAuthcodes have codeUsercodes but codeUsercodes may or may not have an InternalAuth.li liIf the codeUsercode gets deleted, so does his codeInternalAuthcode if he has one does this override an optional behavior of treating optionals like nullablesli ul  pHowever when I try to delete a codeUsercode I receive an exception about the multiplicity of some association between codeInternalAuthcode and codeUsercode.p  ol lipIs it true that if EF understands the multiplicity of a relationship there is a way for it to provide it a unique column name for it so there is a canonical naming conventionpli lipIf so, do you ever really need to define foreign keys explicitly by annotating the model or through Fluent APIpli lipIf not, is it a worthwhile or advisable thing that I should keep trying to avoid it Im thinking along the lines of migrating the data model, database administration, any EF quirkspli lipWhy does attempting to delete the relationship above violate a multiplicity constraint What else does it need to knowpli ol

Negative 2051 pI have a codeUIViewControllercode that gets pushed onto a navigation stack. Id like to extend the standard iOS7 interactive pan gesture to pop this view controller beyond the default codeUIRectEdgeLeftcode boundaries, so that users can initiate an interactive back action by panning from anywhere on the view. p  pIve tried rolling my own interactive view controller transition, but its a lot of hassle to fully replicate the nice parallax handling of the default codeinteractivePopGestureRecognizercode. For example, the codefromViewControllercode hides the navigation bar, while the codetoViewControllercode shows itsomething that is not easy to handle in a custom interactive transition, but is seamless in the default action.p  pAs a result, I want to extend the default action to a larger area of pan gesture, but the API doesnt seem to support simply replacing the gesture.p  pAny creative suggestionsp

Negative 2051 pI have a question which I havent been able to answer to far, my issue is that I have a macro that is using a SQL lookup to access a SQL database and pull information.

Negative 2051 pIs it pythonic to store the expected exceptions of a funcion as attributes of the function itself or just a stinking bad practice. p  pSomething like thisp  precodeclass MyCoolErrorException     pass  def functionargs          raises MyCoolError            do something here     if somecondition         raise MyCoolError  function.MyCoolError  MyCoolError codepre  pAnd there in other modulep  precodetry     function... except function.MyCoolError     ... codepre  pstrongProstrong Anywhere I have a reference to my function, I have also a reference to the exception it can raise, and I dont have to import it explicitly.p  pstrongConstrong I have to repeat the name of the exception to bind it to the function. This could be done with a decorator, but it is also added complexity.p  h1EDITh1  pWhy I am doing this is because I append some methods in an irregular way to some classes, where I think that a mixin it is not worth it. Lets call it tailored added functionality. For instance lets sayp  ul licodeClass Acode uses method codefn1code and codefn2codeli licodeClass Bcode uses method codefn2code and codefn3codeli licodeClass Ccode uses codefn4code ...li liAnd like this for about 15 classes.li ul  pSo when I call codeobja.fn2code, I have to import explicitly the exception it may raise and it is not in the module where classes A, B or C, but in another one where the shared methods live... which I think it is a little bit annoying.

First, declare your Handler inside your Activity and before starting your Service, put some extra data by adding a new Messenger, linked to your Handler.p  precodepublic class HomeActivity extends ActionBarActivity      ConnectionDetector mcd     Intent mnetworkListenerService      public Handler mhandler  new Handler              Override         public void handleMessageMessage msg   This is where main activity thread receives messages                      Bundle  bundle             if msg.what  1    1 MEANS NEW ELEMENT                              bundle  msg.getData                 System.out.println bundle.getStringname                          super.handleMessagemsg                    Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState              super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activityhome          this.mnetworkListenerService  new Intentthis, Network.class         this.mnetworkListenerService.putExtraMessenger, new Messengerthis.mhandler         this.startServicethis.mnetworkListenerService        codepre  pThen, inside your Service class you can do the same with an IntentService class, get your Messenger back and send it as a parameter to your Thread classp  precodepublic class Network extends Service      NetworkListenerThread  mnetworkListenerThread     Messenger   mmessenger      Override     public void onCreate     super.onCreate         Override     public void onDestroy    super.onDestroy        Override     public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, int startId              if intent  null                      Bundle extras  intent.getExtras             if extras  null                              this.mmessenger  Messengerextras.getMessenger                 this.mnetworkListenerThread  new NetworkListenerThreadmmessenger                 this.mnetworkListenerThread.start                               return Service.STARTSTICKY       codepre  pOnce again, get your Messenger back into your Thread classp  precodepublic class NetworkListenerThread extends Thread      private static final int BROADCASTPORT  4415     private DatagramSocket  msocket  null     private Messenger   mmessenger       public  NetworkListenerThreadMessenger messenger              this.mmessenger  messenger       codepre  pFinally, wherever you want to send your data, use this codep  precodeMessage msg  Message.obtain     Creates a message from the message handler to send it back to the main UI msg.what  1     Specifies the type of message Bundle bundle  new Bundle1   Object of size 1 in which we put the data in bundle.putStringname, name   Key  data which is a String msg.setDatabundle   Attaches the bundle to the message try    this.mmessenger.sendmsg     We use the Messenger from the main thread to send the data  catch RemoteException e  e.printStackTrace     codepre

Negative 2051 pIn any of my Java programs I use an integer array for the pixels color values. I then use the Graphics and buffering included libraries to draw these to the screen. In the loop I use to populate the pixel array I use a pointer this is knowledge I adopted from various tutorials such as 0xffffff for white. From my understanding, a pointer is just directions to memory allocations. Why does this work I may just have a vague understanding of pointers but it doesnt quite make sense to me that a direction to some memory would be a color. Could someone please help to enlighten me on why is occurs so that I could potentially use this knowledge in other applications or languagesp

Negative 2051 pI know this question has been asked before and i have seen a couple of possible solutions, but i cant seem to be able to make any of them work for my script.  My script is not a finished product, needs some cleaning up, but it definitely works at the moment.  p  pThe basic function of the script is that it creates snapshots of virtual machines, and then clones them for backup purposes.  Everything works as expected, but the problem is it brings my vcenter to its knees because it is flooding it with too many jobs at once.  I was wanting to limit the amount of jobs that run at once to maybe 34 at the same time.  Can anyone give me a hand  Thanks in advance...

        Here in this code , am trying to display three data , name, price, description. The PHP file will                                  retrieve the data from the database mysql  , and convert the strings into JSon objects. Then my javacode will call the json class and list the data. I can successfully insert the data to the mysql.Am using PHP and JSON parsing for it.When the data inserted into database, the next activity should be listing the data.The problem is no data is coming into my listing activity. only the Activity is coming without data. kindly help me .                    My JSON class for parsing or converting is as follows                              This is my JSON parsing code .In this code first i created a function for get json from the url . then the code for making http request for GET and POST method by using if , else statement . In else method i put the code for get method . i converted it into json object , and the above android code will call it and display it in the activity..

Negative 2051 pIm pretty beginner,so take me easy. I have two listview parallel , here only listViewSelectFile he can makes checks. The problem is when i checked a item from this listview  Example  If i select first item from listview , next items until i move the scroll from listview are unchecked. If on one page they can be maxim 9 items to see first item is check next 8 is unchecked and the 10 item is checked then next 8 items are unchecked then the item 19 is checked and so far one. I tested and with the phone horizontal and its the same problem.I think the problem appear is when i move the scroll next itemsCheckTextView ID  he give the id 0 , and he multiply my CheckTextView ID . How can i solve this  Any example  Thank you  If you dont get this problem maybe you can give me a example how to make 2 listview paralels with textviewcheck.p  precode    PopulateListView codepre  pThe whole code from bot its in PopulateListViewp  precodeadapterImageFileName  new ItemsAdapter                         screen3selectfromlists.this, mImageFilenames                          listViewSelectFile.setAdapteradapterImageFileName              listViewSelectFile                     .setOnItemClickListenernew OnItemClickListener                           Override                         public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt parent,                                 View view, int position, long id                               TODO Autogenerated method stub                              When clicked, show a toast with the TextView text                             try                                  LinearLayout itemLinearLayout view                                 CheckedTextView tv  CheckedTextViewitem.findViewByIdR.id.textView1                             toggletv                               catch Exception e                                  Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext,                                         e.getMessage, Toast.LENGTHLONG                                         .show                                                                            codepre  pToggle function p  precodepublic void toggleCheckedTextView v      if v.isChecked          v.setCheckedfalse      else          v.setCheckedtrue       codepre  pMyAdapter p  precodeprivate class ItemsAdapter extends BaseAdapter           String[] items          public ItemsAdapterContext context, String[] mImageFilenames               TODO Autogenerated constructor stub             this.items  mImageFilenames                   Override         public int getCount               TODO Autogenerated method stub             return items.length                   Override         public Object getItemint position               TODO Autogenerated method stub             return position                   Override         public long getItemIdint position               TODO Autogenerated method stub             return position                   Override         public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent               TODO Autogenerated method stub             View v  convertView             if v  null                  LayoutInflater vi  LayoutInflater getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE                 v  vi.inflateR.layout.listviewrows, null                          CheckedTextView post  CheckedTextViewv                     .findViewByIdR.id.textView1             post.setTextitems[position]             return v                codepre  pstrongand my xml, 2 parallel listviews strong p  precode  ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidbaselineAlignedfalse gt            ltListView             androidididlistviewSelectStudents             androidlayoutwidth0dip             androidlayoutheightmatchparent              androidlayoutweight1             androidchoiceModemultipleChoice             gt         ltListViewgt           ltListView             androidididlistviewSelectFiles             androidlayoutwidth0dip             androidlayoutheightmatchparent              androidlayoutweight1             androidchoiceModemultipleChoicegt         ltListViewgt   ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  plistviewrows.xml p  precode  ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidorientationvertical gt        ltCheckedTextView         androidididtextView1        androidpaddingLeft20dip        androidpaddingRight20dip        androidpaddingTop10dip       androidpaddingBottom10dip        androidorientationvertical        androidlayoutwidthfillparent        androidlayoutheightandroidattrlistPreferredItemHeight         androidgravitycentervertical         androidcheckMarkandroidattrlistChoiceIndicatorMultiple        androidonClicktoggle gt   ltLinearLayoutgt codepre

Negative 2051 pCan someone explain to my why you could submit a form in Mojarra 2.1 that contained a pfileUpload  other fields like pinputText, but this is not possible in 2.2  I completely understand that it is a best practive to have pfileUpload components on their own forms with multipartformdata set.  With that being said, there are times when you might need to include a pfileUpload as a member of a larger form.  For example  p  pimg srchttpsdupage88.netsitepublicagoraimagesitem2746ampv1 altExample where upload is included in larger formp  pHere is JSF 2.1, I used a single form for all elements and it works fine, but in JSF 2.2 the following error is thrown  p  precode Apr 10, 2014 101738 AM com.sun.faces.lifecycle.ApplyRequestValuesPhase execute  WARNING javax.servlet.ServletException      org.apache.tomcat.util.http.fileupload.FileUploadBaseInvalidContentTypeException the request doesnt contain a multipartformdata or multipartmixed stream, content type header is applicationxwwwformurlencoded charsetUTF8 javax.faces.FacesException javax.servlet.ServletException org.apache.tomcat.util.http.fileupload.FileUploadBaseInvalidContentTypeException the request doesnt contain a multipartformdata or multipartmixed stream, content type header is applicationxwwwformurlencoded charsetUTF8 codepre  pIf I broke the above into three forms it is then more difficult to have the top text area and the bottom settings section all updated with the unified Update button because they are separate forms.  Is there anyway to restore the 2.1 behavior in 2.2  Is this a bug in 2.2 or the intended behavior, because I didnt see if documented anywhere that this would break when migrating to 2.2.  p

Negative 2051 pI am using the new UISplitViewController for ios8 that has preferred display modes. My master split view is a UITabBarController with a UINavigationController inside it. I disabled the codepresentsWithSwipecode gesture, and instead have a button in my detail view controller that toggles the splitviewcontroller between 2 preferred display mode states UISplitViewControllerDisplayModeAllVisible and UISplitViewControllerDisplayModePrimaryHidden.p  pWhen I toggle the button so that both view controllers are visible, I can see my navigation controller display its tableview controller. However, when I click on a cell in my tableviewcontroller that performs a storyboard segue to another view controller, I get the following errorp  pcodeUnbalanced calls to beginend appearance transitions for ltReferenceTableViewController 0x7fde50540d50gtcodep  pMy set up is p  pSplitMasterViewController  UITabBarController  UINavigationController  ReferenceTableViewController  ReferenceDetailViewControllerp  pSplitDetailViewController  UINavigationController  MainViewControllerp  pBasically, I want to animate inout the master view controller which provides information relevant to the MainViewController.

Negative 2051 pI have 3 controllersp  pSearchViewControllerp  pCollectionViewControllerp  pMainViewControllerp  pstrongIn shortstrong p  pIn CollectionViewController I can access SearchViewController by tapping the magnify glass in the nav bar. I can then search for a specific item. Then select a result from the rows returned. Once I tap a row the SearchViewController is dismissed and a query is performed on the CollectionViewController.p  pHowever on MainViewController things dont work the same. Because when the SearchViewController is accessed from the MainViewController and dismissed its the MainViewController that appears because that is where the SearchViewController was initialized from so I have to do some extra work to get me to the CollectionViewController to perform the query. I performed in first paragraph.p  pThere is a protocoldelegate method I set in the MainViewController that notifies the CollectionViewController when the SearchViewController is dismissed that is causing the app to crash. I cant figure out why. Please read on to for a better explanation of what is going on.p  pstrongIn longstrongp  pCustomer types what they want to search for in the search box of the SearchViewController and when they tap the row in the associated tableView of results the SearchViewController is dismissed and its parent CollectionViewController is now on screen.

However I have another controller MainViewController. SearchViewController can be accessed from MainViewController but I cant dismiss and perform a query the way I did when I accessed SearchViewController from CollectionViewController because when the SearchViewController is dismissed MainViewController is present on screen because it was the controller I accessed the SearchViewController from.p  pWhat I decided to do was detect which controller initialised SearchViewController then use the same delegate method from above to notify that controller when the SearchViewController was dismissed.p  pstrongInside SearchViewControllerstrongp  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      UITableViewCell cell  [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]        If count of child view controllers is greater than 1 then we are not on main table view controller       if [[[self presentingViewController] childViewControllers] count] gt 1          [self dismissViewControllerAnimatedNO completion         [[self delegate] searchViewControllerDismissedself withTitleForObject[[cell textLabel] text]]     ]      else          [self dismissViewControllerAnimatedNO completion         [[self delegate] searchViewControllerDismissedself withTitleForObject[[cell textLabel] text]]         ]       codepre  pThis works fine.

Negative 2051 pSo basically, Im trying to send some data to a remote PHP page, via POST, with 4 static parameters and one random parameter, a number. So far what I have done is created an HTML page with a form with 4 hidden fields and 1 empty field, in which a random number is inserted as the value via Javascript using Math.random. Now whenever I submit this form, it takes me to the remote PHP page, and so I have to click back again in the browser and then submit.p  pSo, I decided to load this form in an iFrame in another HTML Page, so after clicking submit, I can just hit refresh, and then submit again. p  pI want to know, is there a way I can use Javascript in the parent HTML to automatically submit the form in the iFrame, then create a new random value and submit it againp  pHere is my code so farp  pa.htmlp  precodelthtmlgt ltbodygt ltform methodpost actionhttpawebsite.comremotefile.phpgt some hidden fields with the static values ltinput typetext idmytext namemobilenogt ltinput typesubmitgt ltformgt ltscriptgtdont remember the exact code, use javascript to generate a random number which is put in the value for mytext via getElementByIdltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pnow this was the form which was to manually send data to the serverp  pthis is to load an iframe b.htmlp  precodelthtmlgt ltbodygt ltiframe srca.htmlgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pCan I use javascript in b.html to resend the form multiple times, but with the value of mobileno different each time Or can I simply send POST data with the parameters to the server via simple Javascript or PHPp
Negative 2051 pHow exactly are you meant to implement an codeIReferenceClockcode that can be set via codeIMediaFilterSetSyncSourcecodep  pI have a system that implements codeGetTimecode and codeAdviseTimecode, codeUnadviseTimecode.  When a stream starts playing it sets a base time via codeAdviseTimecode and then increases Stream Time for each subsequent advise.p  pHowever how am I supposed to know when a new graph has run  I need to set a zero point for a given reference clock.  Otherwise if I create a reference clock and then, 10 seconds later, I start the graph I am now in the position that I dont know whether I should be 10 seconds down the playback or whether I should be starting from 0.  Obviously the base time will say that I am starting from 0 but have I just stalled for 10 seconds and do I need to drop a bunch of framesp  pI really cant seem to figure out how to write a proper codeIReferenceClockcode so any hints or ideas would be hugely appreciated.p  pstrongemEditemstrong  One example of a problem I am having is that I have 2 graphs and 2 videos.  The audio from both videos is going to a null renderer.  The Video to a standard CLSIDVideoRenderer.  Now If i set the same reference clock to both and then Run graph 1 all seems to be fine.  However if 10 seconds down the line I run graph 2 then it will run as though the codeSetSyncSourcecode is NULL for the first 10 seconds or so until it has caught up with the other video.  p  pObviously if the graphs called codeGetTimecode to get their base time this would solve the problem but this is not what Im seeing happening.  Both videos end up with a base time of 0 because thats the point I run them from.p  pIts worth noting that if I set no clock at all or call codeSetDefaultSyncSourcecode then both graphs run as fast as they can.  I assume this is due to the lack of an Audio Renderer ...p

Negative 2051 pIm writing a simple app to seek an html5 video in both directions by dragging mouse. I also need to overlay stuff on top of the video so Im using html5 canvas. The video element stays hidden, I play the video and update the canvas image every 20 ms. This much has no performance issues.p  pHowever I want to seek the video when I drag the mouse. It turns out that I would need to seek the video every 20 ms which leads to a choppy performance. Another hack I tried was to fast forward the underlying video when I drag. This has almost perfect performance and is sufficient for my use case except I cant rewind and fastforward the video.p  pMy research says the only way right now to rewind an html5 video is to set the currentTime backwards frame by frame, but again I cant afford to do this every 20ms or the video gets choppy.p  pIs there any way around these limitations It would be enough if I can just play the video backwards in normal speed.p

Negative 2051 pIm looking for a js graphing library that supports creating directed acyclic graphs using drag and drop. The UI would have a canvas with a list of elements that can be dragged onto the canvas to create a directed acyclic graph. Objects have labels and properties. Relationships between objects are depicted by the connections between them.p  pIve seen a number of great threads with thorough lists of js libraries but none of them seemed to be designed for building a drag and drop UI. They seem quite capable of rendering predesigned graphs. p

Negative 2051 pCurrently I am working on a project that combines basic authentication with the cornice  pyramid framework.p  pFrom the logging I observe that every time a url is access the used credentials get checked twice. Since in our user case this does involve a lot of database checks, it is a potential target for an unintended DoS attack.p  pIn my view I define a cornice Service with a factory. In my app setup I configured the pyramid provided BasicAuthenticationPolicy with the resource intensive check as a callback for authentication Also in the app setup I configure the pyramid provided ACLAuthorizationPolicy for authorisation.p  pSo I was wondering, what I am missing, as I would really like to prevent the second check to take place. Should I cache this on the request object in some secure wayp

Negative 2051 pBuilding my first angular app and I dont understand how to split the code into smaller chunks. I just have one long runon controller, but if I try to separate the code into separate sections controllers, services, etc, suddenly the data isnt binding to the view anymore ie. I update data, but changes arent showing in the viewbrowser.p  pie. I have a simple app that connects to an api to get a list of Books, it then displays the list, and allows the user to navigate using pagination, or get more details for a single book, or update a book record editdelete.p  pI would like to split the functions up into separate controllers like p  ul listrongsearchstrong controller handles form validation, http to apili listrongbooksstrong list displays results from search apili listrongbookstrong single controller each item in the books list is a single item with calls like more details and editdeleteli listrongpaginationstrong controller functions to nextprev through books listli listrongmessagesstrong controller display a successerror message when doing an action in a search, book, or pagination controllers.li ul  pTrouble is I dont know how to set this up, because if I use services to storeoutput the books model or messages model, when I make an update to this data through one of the controllers, the change doesnt automatically update the view like it would if I updated a scope variable that is linked to a controller.p  pFrom what I understand, a scope variable in a view updates automatically because the codengcontrollerMyCtrlcode is binding to a region. But how would that work with a service You dont use an codengservicecode tag, right...p  pSo lets say I have my searchController call the api, receive a json of all the books. I shove that into the booksService for storage. Then my booksController, which is responsible for updating the list view of all the books on the page, has to load this booksService to get the new data... but how does it know the data was updated How do I link the data from the booksService, through the booksController, to display the new results in the viewp  pAnd also, how would I go about structuring the booksService  how do I get searchController to pass in new data to update a persistent variable I can use for the model, and then how do I get booksController to load in that new data Do I need to create a call from within booksService to PUSH the new data to booksController, or should booksController have a call to PULL the new data from booksService and if so, how would it know when it should make a PULLp  pAs well, searchController and paginationController would be making a GET call with matching query to the same API only difference would be the page variable in the query. Should I be using a service or is it a factory to decouple that http.get requestp  pLastly, whats the best way to structure all of these controllersservices in a folderfile structure Should I be aiming to separate each chunk onto a separate .js file Should I be using require.js to import the files In this case, its a single page of a website where there could be additional other page like this one on the website. If I split the code into separate files, should I group the files in one folder per webpage basis ie. if I add a users dashboard page, all files would be stored in a separate folder from the search books page.p  pSorry, I know Im asking a lot, but this would really help me wrap my mind around the concepts involved in properly structuring an Angular app.p

Negative 2051 pWeird goings on with my VS2013 projects.

Negative 2051 pHow do you think set the codePATHcode in strongWindows 7 64bitstrong to have access to both 32 and 64 bit compilers. I have noteiced that appart from different folders everything such as codejava.execode, codejavac.execode, etc. are exactly the same. I believe the first path in the codePATHcode variable either with 32bit binaries or the 64bit will take precedence.p  pMy idea would be to change 64bit compilers name java.exe and class execute programs name javac.exe and let say add code64bitcode postfix but I am not sure if that would work. Please advice.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 2051 pI have several methods in my program where I have a char str, which I malloc, and then need to return str at the end of the method. Im at a loss on where I need to put the free statement in these methods. If I free before I return str, the str is empty, and if I do it after the return statement, it wont be freed at the right time I guess If i e.g. exit the program before it is freed, this will create memory leaks. What is the correct way to do this p

Negative 2051 pBecause objects are reference types, not value types, if you set a codeUIViewcode equal to another codeUIViewcode, the views are the same object. If you modify one youll modifying the other as well.p  pI have an interesting situation where I would like to add a codeUIViewcode as a subview in another view, then I make some modifications, and those modifications should not affect the original codeUIViewcode. How can I make a copy of the codeUIViewcode so I can ensure I add that copy as a subview instead of a reference to the original codeUIViewcode p  pNote that I cant recreate the view in the same way the original was created, I need some way to create a copy given any codeUIViewcode object.p

Negative 2051 pCurrently Im working on an academic app, where I need to handle nearly 1000 mathematical formulas. So, I have prepared an excel sheet with all the formulas in it. Most of the formula has subscript and superscript characters. I have uploaded the excel file in my web service. Im using AFNetworking to hit the service and get the values. Now, while getting the values, the superscript and subscript words are not displayed correctly. For example, x square is displayed as x2. But I want it as x superscript 2. How to get the values correctly from the service and show it in my UILabel.p  pIdeas are appreciated. p

Using the OpenSSLPKeyPKeysign method produces a license key that can only be verified on the command line by running     echo n testexample.com  openssl dgst sha256 sign test.pem   while using the privateencrypt method produces a key that can only be verified on the command line by running     echo n testexample.com  openssl dgst sha256 binary  openssl rsautl sign inkey test.pem   Im not sure what the exact difference between the two commands above is and why they correspond to the two different Ruby signing methods below. Neither approach produces something that SecVerifyTransformCreate will verify, however.

Negative 2051 pI have been using Django for many years since Django 1.2. and in the past, I used different type of web frameworks such as emCakePHPem, emRailsem, emASP.NET MVCem, and some other fullstack framework. Django wasnt my first framework.p  pDifferent frameworks have differences in their approaches and benefits. There are certain part of those framework I like and I dont. In this context, Id like to look at the design of Django Framework in more specific.p  pAfter transition to Django, I like how it design its framework. When learning a new language such as Go, Scala, Ruby, Haskell, I try to looks for a framework that has some similarity in its design especially those I mentioned later.p  pThe following are the 2 Django framework design decision that is very differentp  ul liit encourage strongpluggable appsstrong or strongapps reusabilitystrong. Hence ul limoving away from a hrefhttpwww.slideshare.netjacobianthebestandworstofdjango relnofollowmonolithic design by Jacob KaplanMossali liusing multiple apps to a hrefhttpsgithub.commontyloungedjangomingus relnofollowcreate a full feature site, without any model or logicali liwriting a Projectless Django mentioned in a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick1590599969 relnofollowPractical Django Projects by James Bennettali ulli liit uses strongModel View Templatestrong instead of classical MVC ul limentioned in a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.8faqgeneraldjangoappearstobeamvcframeworkbutyoucallthecontrollertheviewandtheviewthetemplatehowcomeyoudontusethestandardnames relnofollowFAQa. li liemviewem describes which data is presentedli liemtemplateem describes how the data is presentedli lia view normally delegates to a emtemplateemli liemcontrollerem is probably the framework itself the machinery that sends a request to the appropriate view, according to the Django URL configuration.li ulli ul  pI would not believe that Django pioneer such features. I believed this pattern is very common in Framework Design. Just that I have no idea, what is this design pattern called This concept is very useful to be applied in other framework. I believed knowing the name of the pattern could help me understand or even build a new framework on different language with the same concept. p  pCurrently there are tons of web framework, most of them are following the classic MVC pattern. Some use the concept of plugin to add certain capability. Plugin however solve the reusability in different approach depending on the context.p  pSo I did tried to learn as many framework I could in order to find an alternative framework in different languages. Hoping that I could find out the pattern that Django use. However, it is very difficult for me to learn a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiComparisonofwebapplicationframeworks relnofollowall of thema.

Negative 2051 pI know it sound absurd to use codeweakptrscode with codeuniqueptrscode, but bear with me please.p  pI have a set of widgets and animations that act on them. The widgets have a clear owner, who creates and destroys them. All the widgets are created, destroyed, animated in one thread, so one widget cant be destroyed while the animation code is running. As you can see, the widgets are are somehow shared with the animations, but the animation should stop if the widgets gets deleted. p  pThe current approach is to use codestduniqueptrcode for the owners of the widgets and expose them as raw pointers to the animations. This makes very difficult findingdebugging dangling pointers. One proposal was to change to codestdsharedptrcode inside the owner class and expose codestdweakptrscode to the animations, but this will add some unwantedunneeded overhead in the system. p  pIs it possible a good idea to create some sort of weakptr on top of codestduniqueptrcode that just flags that the pointer was deleted If yes, can you please suggest me some implementations with minimal overhead for single threaded usage.p  pEDITp  pOne more clarification  the widgets are used in one thread, but the application has multiple threads. Also lots of animations run in parallel and each animation is updated 60 timessecond. The overhead from codestdsharedptrstdweakptrcode comes from the atomic counter used inside codestdsharedptrcode, that actually is not needed in this particular case.p  pEDITp  pIm not asking if I can use codestdweakptrcode with codestduniqueptrcode, I know this is not possible. Im asking if it is a good ideapossible to build something with similar behavior as codestdweakptrcode that can be paired with codestduniqueptrcodep

This would push up the height.score to a high number while everything else remains on 1 or 0.p  pNow they start looking for things based on weight.

I mean the only thing that possibly could have stopped my trojan is my firewall which detected an outgoing connection. So I dont understand why other trojans are detected but not this new one.p  pI can provide source code if needed, and I would like to emphasize that I do this only for educational purposes.

Negative 2051 pI am working on an Image Processing toolbox, that links OpenCV to Scilab, so that OpenCV functions can be used in Scilab directly. Now, my issue is that I have many functions that are used in all the other codes, so i decided to include those in an external cpp file, and include that in my other codes. What I did was, i made a header file common.h with the function definitions. common.c has the actual functions written. And all my other files, for e.g opencvimcrop have a include common.h along with the other included header files. However, when i compile this in Scilab using my builder gateway filea .sce file that compiles my opencvimcrop.cpp, it gives the following errorp  pemopencvimcrop.cpp1422 fatal error common.h No such file or directory compilation terminated.emp  pThis is my common.h filep  precodeinclude common.cpp  string type2strint type int noofchannelsint type int retrieveImageMat ampimage int returnImagechar checker,int amptemp,Mat img codepre  pThis is my common.cpp filep  precodestring type2strint type       string r     uchar depth  type amp CVMATDEPTHMASK     switch  depth               case CV8U  r  8U break         case CV8S  r  8S break         case CV16U r  16U break         case CV16S r  16S break         case CV32S r  32S break         case CV32F r  32F break         case CV64F r  64F break         default     r  User break          return r   int noofchannelsint type      uchar chans  1  type gtgt CVCNSHIFT     return chans  Note  the other 2 functions are also present here, but they  comprise of 800 lines of code, so i did not paste them here codepre  pMy opencvimcrop.cppThe file that has to include the above made header file to use the functions file isp  precodeinclude ltnumericgt include opencv2corecore.hpp include opencv2highguihighgui.hpp include opencv2opencv.hpp include ltiostreamgt using namespace cv using namespace std extern C    include apiscilab.h   include Scierror.h   include BOOL.h   include ltlocalization.hgt   include common.h    int opencvimcropchar fname, unsigned long fnamelen         SciErr sciErr     int iRows0,iCols0     int piAddr  NULL     int piAddrNew  NULL     int piAddr2   NULL     int piAddr3   NULL     int piAddr4   NULL     int piAddr5   NULL     unsigned char pstDataR  NULL     unsigned char pstDataG  NULL     unsigned char pstDataB  NULL     int i,j,k     double x,y,width,height      checking input argument     CheckInputArgumentpvApiCtx, 5, 5     CheckOutputArgumentpvApiCtx, 1, 1       Mat image     retrieveImageimage      for value of topleft xcoordinate     sciErr  getVarAddressFromPositionpvApiCtx,2,amppiAddr2     if sciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0          sciErr  getMatrixOfDoublepvApiCtx, piAddr2, ampiRows, ampiCols ,ampx     ifsciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0              for value topleft ycoordinate     sciErr  getVarAddressFromPositionpvApiCtx,3,amppiAddr3     if sciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0          sciErr  getMatrixOfDoublepvApiCtx, piAddr3, ampiRows, ampiCols ,ampy     ifsciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0           for value of width     sciErr  getVarAddressFromPositionpvApiCtx,4,amppiAddr4     if sciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0          sciErr  getMatrixOfDoublepvApiCtx, piAddr4, ampiRows, ampiCols ,ampwidth     ifsciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0              for value of height     sciErr  getVarAddressFromPositionpvApiCtx,5,amppiAddr5     if sciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0          sciErr  getMatrixOfDoublepvApiCtx, piAddr5, ampiRows, ampiCols ,ampheight     ifsciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0              defining a temporary rectangle, that denotes the area that has to be cropped into the new image     Rect myROIx[0], y[0], width[0], height[0]       Crop the full image to that image contained by the rectangle myROI      Note that this doesnt copy the data     Mat croppedRefimage, myROI      Mat cropped      Copy the data into new matrix     croppedRef.copyTocropped      int temp  nbInputArgumentpvApiCtx  1     string tempstring  type2strcropped.type     char checker     checker  char malloctempstring.size  1     memcpychecker, tempstring.cstr, tempstring.size  1     returnImagechecker,temp,cropped      Assigning the list as the Output Variable     AssignOutputVariablepvApiCtx, 1  nbInputArgumentpvApiCtx  1     Returning the Output Variables as arguments to the Scilab environment     ReturnArgumentspvApiCtx     return 0         codepre  pAnd finally, the .scebuildergatewaycpp.sce file i execute in scilab to compile the above cpp file is as followsp  precodefunction buildergwcpp     WITHOUTAUTOPUTLHSVAR  t tbxbuildgatewayskeletoncpp69690, ..

Negative 2051 pI currently have some images with color varying in a somewhat smooth way, i.e. regions blending into each other.  Think Tie Dye maybe.  I would like to average the image by averaging each pixcel with adjacent ones, using an input N for  N pixcels in X and Y. Ideally, it should go to a solid color as N increases, but for smaller N simply blur regions.   I have read up on LABspace in order to do this rather than RGB, as well as the trick of averaging quadratically i.e. adding squares and then taking the square root for each RGB or LAB channel.  This code I have written however only works for the N0 case in returning the original image, however any value N1 returns a solid color.  I would expect that local variations would take a while until getting my solid image.  Is there simply a bug I have not caught, or am I fundamentally misunderstanding how to average the pixels locally  Thanksp  precode  function [NewGrid]  Average Grid, N   Average RGB over N distance pixcels SsizeGrid XS1 YS2       Convert to labspace     cformmakecformsrgb2lab     NewLabapplycformGrid,cform      runsum[0 0 0]      for i1X         for j1Y             for kNN                 for lNN                     shiftxmodik,X                     shiftymodjl,Y                     if shiftx0                         shiftxX                     end                     if shifty0                         shiftyY                     end                     runsum1runsum1NewLabshiftx,shifty,12                     runsum2runsum2NewLabshiftx,shifty,22                     runsum3runsum3NewLabshiftx,shifty,32                 end             end             NewLabi,j,1sqrtrunsum1N1             NewLabi,j,2sqrtrunsum2N1             NewLabi,j,3sqrtrunsum3N1             runsum[0 0 0]         end     end      imageGrid     figure      Convert back to rgb     cformmakecformlab2srgb     NewGridapplycformNewLab,cform     imageNewGrid     end codepre

Negative 2051 pI ran into an issue with the Classic ASP VbScript codeInStrcode function.  As shown below, the second call to codeInStrcode returns code1code when searching for an empty string in a non empty string.  Im curious why this is happening.p  precode InStr Test Dim someText  someText  So say we all Dim emptyString  emptyString     I expect this to be true If inStr1,someText,so,1 gt 0 Then     Response.write  I found soltbr gt  End If    I expect this to be false If inStr1, someText, emptyString, 1 gt 0 Then     Response.Write I found an empty stringltbr gt  End If codepre  pstrongEDITstrong Some additional clarification  The reason for the question came up when debugging legacy code and running into a situation like thisp  precodeFunction Govalue      If InStr1, Option1Option2Option3, value, 1 gt 0 Then            Do some stuff      End If End Function codepre  pIn some cases function codeGocode can get called with an empty string.  The original developers intent was not to check whether codevaluecode was empty, but rather, whether or not codevaluecode was equal to one of the piped delimited values Option1,Option2, etc..p  pThinking about this further it makes sense that every string is created from an empty string, and I can understand why a programming language would assume a string with all characters removed still contains the empty string.p  pWhat doesnt make sense to me is why programming languages are implementing this.  Consider these 2 statementsp  precodeInStrso say we all, s  evaluates to 1 InStrso say we all,    evaluates to 1 codepre  pThe codeInStrcode function will return the position of the first occurrence of one string within another. In both of the above cases, the result is 1.  However, position 1 always contains the character s, not an empty string.  Furthermore, using another string function like Len or LenB on an empty string alone will result in 0, indicating a character length of 0.p  pIt seems that there is some inconsistency here.  The empty string contained in all strings is not actually a character, but the InStr function is treating it as one when other string functions are not.  I find this to be unintuitive and unnecessary.p

Negative 2051 pSo I have a horizontal RecyclerView inside a vertical ScrollView. Everything inside my layout is displayed fine and it all scrolls in the directions I want and it does it smoothly. p  pThe only problem I have, is that the RecyclerView is below some other content in the ScrollView and when the RecyclerView is partially visible, it will line the bottom of the RecyclerView with the bottom of the screen on startup. This means that the content above the RecyclerView is pushed off the screen.p  pDoes anyone know why this happens, and how I can fix itp  pHere is a simple layout that does what I just described. You dont even need to populate the RecyclerView, it will still do it.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltScrollView     xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt      ltLinearLayout         androidorientationvertical         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt          ltLinearLayout             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheight500dp             androidbackgroundfffgt          ltandroid.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheight200dp             androidbackground000gt      ltLinearLayoutgt  ltScrollViewgt codepre

Also, I know its bad practice to include a .cc file rather than a header, but Im not too familiar with doing that and anyway, I have definitely seen this work before. I was under the impression that including that .cc file containing the function is equivalent to placing it right there, so it should definitely be recognising the earlier code. One thing I have noticed is that the error is referring to shuffle.cc rather than what it usually says, something along the lines of from file located in Maps.cc..., perhaps this has something to do with it In any case Im stumped, thanks in advance for any helpp  pJoshuap

Negative 2051 pI recently inherited a system using the Umbraco CMS. The initial setup is a bit odd in that every node is a root node theres no tree structure. Before today everything was functioning as expected. Navigating to www.mysite.com would display www.mysite.comhome, but theres never been any apparent redirect. p  pWe started seeing some odd behavior today. Navigating to www.mysite.com now displays either www.mysite.comhome or www.mysite.comsomeotherpage. Its always the same secondary page, but which one is served up seems to be random.

Negative 2051 pI know we can not write any socket programming using normal java script as those are the client side codes. It is possible to create server that bind to a port using node. js. But I do not need those. One of my complex requirement is that I have java http server running in  my machine which bind to a port number 7878. When the java server is started, I want the client code which is running in my browser should get notify that the server is started.  Is it practically possible  Or is it possible for node. js or any js framework which will be running in the client side code and listens to the port number 7878.and when the java server is started it will get notified.  Thanks in advance for any suggestionssolutions. p
Negative 2051 pIm working on a site with registrationlogin capabilities. Ive got a signup php file which just holds the signup form and posts the variables. Then Ive got a functions file which connects to the database this was done in an external file but I moved it to make troubleshooting simpler, a function which validates the form input everything is filled in, password is relatively secure, makes sure there are no current users with the email this user has provided, and then attempts to register. The signup form just runs the codesignUpSubmitcode function on post.p  pThe problem is that it crashes as soon as I attempt to prepare a statement. The code below works mostly. If I enter invalid data in the form dont type a fairly secure password, dont fill something in, it throws the error just fine. If I run it with the code to check for a user that already has this email commented, it works fine, just takes you back to the signup page. If, however, I uncomment even the first line of the commented code below codestmt  dbgtprepareSELECT  FROMcodeuserscodeWHERE email  emailcode, it just loads a blank page, as if theres some kind of syntax error. It must be connecting to the database properly, as if I mess up my username or password for the connection it DOES throw an error, where theres none if everything is set correctly.

Negative 2051 pI am trying to implement OAuth2 into my Spring Boot app.  When making a call to oauthtoken using a password grant, I am able to authenticate using Basic auth with a usernamepassword against a database.  The authentication object is loaded into the security context and the filter continues.  However I noticed that further down the line the OAuth2AuthenticationProcessingFilter is called and cleans out the security context bc no OAuth bearer token is found.  This ultimately results in an authentication failure at the TokenEndpoint.postAccessToken method e.g. oauthtoken.p  pIs it expected that the OAuth2AuthenticationProcessingFilter would be called during a oauthtoken call  If not, any ideas why If it is expected what is the best fixwork around for this issue, to set stateless on the OAuth2AuthenticationProcessingFilter to false  Not sure if that is a good idea or not...p  pSome relevant info, I am using xml config for my spring security settings and JavaConfig for the rest.  The grant type is password on the oauthtoken call.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.

Negative 2051 pWorking on a part of my iOS project that needs to refer to a specific object that the user selects in the main application that is set through a toggle switch that activates the specified object to be used in a Today Extension to record simple objects created by the user in the Today Extension.
