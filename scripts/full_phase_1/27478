Positive 27478 pI am attempting to write a script that on form submit will send two sets of data to two different spreadsheets. The data is derived from one form.

That employee approves the request, then presses a button that runs a script to allow the accountant to edit the document.p  pThe scripts work, but the second two scripts ask for authorization every time they run even from me.

SO will have more of a debate than you can get on a blog. p  pIm running into an issue with a join getting back too many records. I think of this as expansion. I added a table to the set of joins and the number of rows expanded, way too much. Usually when this happens I add a select of all the ID fields that are involved in the join. That way its pretty obvious where the expansion is happening and I can change the ON of the join to fix it. Except in this case, the table that I added doesnt have an ID field. To me, this is a problem.

Negative 27478 pThere is an iPad app called a hrefhttpavatron.comappsairdisplay relnofollowAir Displaya which turns your iPad into a wireless second monitor for your computer. I havent personally tried it so I cant vouch for its effectiveness, and I assume it has a significant amount of lag, but I think it would be very useful to toss something for reference onto the iPad screen and then work on your laptop screen. For example if you were writing a research paper you could find something useful in the browser, then toss it over to the iPad screen and type in Word on your main screen.p  pWhen I see this sort of thing I wonder how they implement it. Where do I even begin learning this, for Windows 7 I have some C experience and some C experience, and a little Win32 experience. Im guessing they have to develop a virtual driver of some sort which tricks Windows into thinking a second monitor is attached, and then pipe the display over wireless to the iPad where an iPad app displays it on the screen.p  pSo I assume I would have to write a Display Adapter driver, right Where do I go to learn how to do so Are there specs on such a thing I think I can figure the rest out, but I guess the mysterious part is how to write a driver to trick Windows into thinking my application is a second monitor, and grabbing the pixels from applications in the virtual second monitor.p  pCan you start me off with some resources on creating drivers or somethingp
Negative 27478 pI m trying to develop an Image Processing application for the images stored at the photo library of the iPhone, but to tell the truth I am confused. Im interested in getting the A R G B matrixes out of the image. then make some algorithm with these matrixes and then releasing them. What would you prefer for the aforementioned method Developing the algorithm with 2dimensional matrixes using malloc and then free or would you use 1dimensional matrixes with both malloc and free When I m not using malloc I face problems with the memory, probably its not enough to store both the uiimage and all these matrixes at the same time at the memory.

Negative 27478 pI have a SQLServer table that contains snapshot data. I need to compare the latest row against the previous and determine if certain columns have changed.

I expect every row to produce at least one xml document.p  pWhere is the best place to perform the comparison, should I do this in stored proceedures, one for every combination of columns. Or should I pull back the whole rows via ADO.NET and compare them in code Is there an easy way of doing the comparisonp
Negative 27478 pIm building a server application that needs to perform a lot of http requests to a couple other servers on an ongoing basis.

At the very least Ill need some more CPU horse power, but Im wondering if I would gain any advantages by using the async methods of the HttpWebRequest object eg .BeginGetResponse  as opposed to creating threads myself and using the synchronous methods eg .GetResponse  on these threads.p  pIf I go with the async methods, I obviously have to significantly redesign my app, so Im wondering if anyone might have some insight before I go and recode everything, in case Im out to lunch.p  pThanksp

Negative 27478 pWe have a Java desktop app with an embedded browser, now using XULRunner Firefox engine on SWT. This browsers API allows us to load webs specifying an URI or its HTML content.

The best solution would be to provide a listener used when the engine tries to load resources so we can send it the appropriate content.p  pAny ideas thank youp

Negative 27478 pIm implementing secure passcode functionality within the app.  Part of the solution is based on the PTPasscodeViewController sample code that can be found on GitHub.  The issue I am having is when the app is first launched and the PIN is typed the UI is not updated with a circle in each box.  If the 4 digits of the PIN that was entered are incorrect my message isnt displaying.  Its as if the runloop isnt getting executed or something.  If I enter the correct PIN the app is unlocked as expected.  The functionality works but the UI isnt updated.p  pOnce the app is unlocked if I go into Settings in the app and change the passcode the dots show up just fine and if during PIN confirmation the second PIN does not match the first the UI is also updated correctly.p  pBackground multitasking is enabled in this app.  On iOS 4.2.1 when the app becomes active again the same PIN validation logic is used as when the app is first launched.  The only difference is it isnt really the first lauch but a return from the background.  In this case, the PIN validation logic AND UI works correctly... the same code is executing.  The dots and any messages are correctly displayed.p  pHowever, on 3.1.2, since background multitasking is not supported the app is always launched from scratch.  So every time the app is launched the functionality works but the UI fails to update properly.p  pI must have a basic misunderstanding of something here but not sure what it is that I dont get.  Can anyone point me in the right directionp

Negative 27478 pI am working on a android app and I have an EditText where user can input numbers. I want to format the number using different currency formats say ,, and I want to do it on the fly, ie when user enter each digitnot when enter is pressed. I googled around, and came across a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidtextTextWatcher.htmlTextWatchera which I first found promising, but it turned out to be an absolute pain. I am debugging my code on a HTC Desire phone which only has a soft keyboard.p  pNow I want to get a callback when user press numbers 0 to 9 , del backspace key and enter key. From my testing I found these atleast on my phonep  blockquote   p1 editText onKeyListener is called   when user presses del or enter key.   When user presses enter, onKey   function is called twice for one enter   which I believe is for ACTIONUP and   ACTIONDOWN. When user presses del,   onKey is called once only for   ACTIONDOWN which I dont know why.   onKey is never called when user   presses any digits0 to 9 which too I   cant understand. p      p2 TextWatchers 3 callback functions   are called beforeTextChanged,   onTextChanged, afterTextChanged   whenever user presses any number 0 to   9 key  . So I thought by using   TextWatcher and onKeyListener together   I can get all callbacks I need.p blockquote  pNow my questions are these..p  blockquote   p1 First in my HTC soft keyboard there   is a key a keyboard symbol with a   down arrow and when I click on it   keyboard is resigned without giving   any callback. I still cant believe   android letting user to edit a field   and resign without letting program to   process save the edit. Now my   editText is showing one value and my   object has another value I am saving   user edits on enter, and handling back   press on keyboard  by reseting   editText value with the value in the   object , but I have no answer to this   keyboard down key.  p      p2 Second, I want to format the number   after user entered the new digit. Say   I already have 123 on editText and   user entered pressed 4, I want my   editText to display 1,234. I get full   number on onTextChanged and   afterTextChanged and I can format   the   number and put it back to   editText in any of these callback.   Which one should I use Which is the   best practicep      p3 Third one is the most crucial   problem. When app start I put the   current object value in the editText.   Say I put 123 on onResume, and when   user enter a digit say 4 I want it   to be 1234. But on my onTextChanged   callback what I am getting is 4123. When   I press one more key say 5 I am   getting 45123. So for user inputs   editText cursor are pointing to end of   the text. But when value is set by   hand, editText cursor dont seems to be   updating. I believe I have to do   something in textWatcher callbacks but   I dont know what I should do.p blockquote  pI am posting my code below.p  precodepublic class AppHome extends AppBaseActivity      private EditText ed  null     private NumberFormat amountFormatter  null     private boolean  isUserInput  true      Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.apphomescreen          ed  EditTextfindViewByIdR.id.mainamounttextfield         amountFormatter  new DecimalFormat,,           ed.setOnKeyListenernew View.OnKeyListener              Override             public boolean onKeyView v, int keyCode, KeyEvent event                  ifevent.getAction  KeyEvent.ACTIONDOWN                      return true                 String strippedAmount  ed.getText.toString.replace,,                  ifkeyCode  KeyEvent.KEYCODEDEL                     delete pressed, strip number of comas and then delete least significant digit.                     strippedAmount  strippedAmount.substring0, strippedAmount.length  1                     int amountNumeral  0                     try                         amountNumeral  Integer.parseIntstrippedAmount                      catchNumberFormatException e                                          myObject.amount  amountNumeral                     isUserInput  false                     setFormattedAmountamountNumeral,ed.getId                 else ifkeyCode  KeyEvent.KEYCODEENTER                     enter pressed, save edits and resign keyboard                     int amountNumeral  0                     try                         amountNumeral  Integer.parseIntstrippedAmount                      catchNumberFormatException e                                          myObject.amount  amountNumeral                     isUserInput  false                     setFormattedAmountmyObject.amount,ed.getId                     save edits                     save                     resign keyboard..

Negative 27478 pThis is my first post here, so I hope everything is fine.p  pHere is my problem I have a table in my database called strongUserTypesstrong. It hasp  ol liIDli liIsPrivateli liParentIDli ol  pThe relevant ones are the first and the third one. I have another table called strongUserTypesTstrong which has information for the different types, that is language specific. The fields arep  ol liLanguageIDli liUserTypeIDli liNameli ol  pWhat Im trying to achieve is load the entire hierarchy from the strongUserTypesstrong table and show it in a TreeView this is not relevant for now. Then, by selecting some of the user types I can edit them in separate edit box the name and a combo box the parent.p  pEverything works fine until I try to persist the changes in the database. EF has generated for me two entity classes for those tablesp  pThe class for the user types hasp  ol liIDli liIsPrivateli liParentIDli liA navigational property for the selfreference 0..1li liA navigational property for the child elementsli liAnother navigational property for the UserTypesT table 1..li ol  pThe class for the translated information hasp  ol liUserTypeIDli liLanguageIDli liNameli liA navigational property to the UserTypes table ..1li liA navigational property to the Languages table ..1li ol  pI get the data I need usingp  precodereturn context.UserTypes.IncludeUserTypesT.Whereut gt ut.IsPrivatefalse.ToList codepre  pin my WCF Web service. I can add new user types with no problems, but when I try to update the old ones, some strange things happen.p  pIf I update a root element ParentIDnull everything works If I update an element where ParentIDnull I get the following errorp  blockquote   pAcceptChanges cannot continue because the objects key values conflict with another object in the ObjectStateManager.p blockquote  pI searched all over the internet and read the blog post from a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combdiegoarchive20101006selftrackingentitiesapplychangesandduplicateentities.aspx relnofollowDiego B Vegaa and many more but my problem is different. When I change a parent user type, I actually change the ParentID property, not the navigational property. I always try to work with the IDs, not the generated navigational properties in order to avoid problems.p  pI did a little research, tried to see what is the object graph that I get and saw that there were lots of duplicate entitiesp  pThe root element had a list of its child elements. Each child element had a back reference to the root or to its parent and so on. You can imagine. As I wasnt using those navigational properties, because I used the IDs to getset the data I needed, I deleted them from the model. To be specific I deleted points strong4strong and strong5strong from the strongUserTypesstrong entity class. Then I had an object graph with each element only once. I tried a new update but I had the same problemp  pThe root element was updated fine, but the elements, that had some parents, threw the same exception.p  pI saw that I had a navigational property in the strongUserTypesTstrong entity class, pointing to a user type, so I deleted it too. Then this error disappeared. All the items in the object graph were unique. But the problem remained  I could update my root element with no problems, but when trying to update the children with no exclusions I got a null reference exception in the generated Model.Context.Extensions classp  precodeif context.ObjectStateManager.TryGetObjectStateEntryentityInSet.Item2, out entry      context.AddObjectentityInSet.Item1, entityInSet.Item2here  codepre  pI tried to update only the name which is in strongUserTypesTstrong but the error is the same.p  pIm out of ideas and Ive been trying to solve this problem for 8 hours now, so Ill appreciate if someone gives me ideas or share their experience.p  pPSp  pThe only way I succeeded updating a child object was using the following code to retrieve the datap  precodevar userTypes  argoContext.UserTypes.IncludeUserTypesT.Whereut gt ut.IsPrivatefalse.ToList foreach UserType ut in userTypes      ut.UserType1  null     ut.UserTypes1  null  return userTypes codepre  pwhere strongUserType1strong is the navigational property, pointing to the parent user type and strongUserTypes1strong is the navigational property, holding a list of the child element. The problem here was that EF fixups the objects and changes the strongParentIDstrong to emnullem. If I set it back again, EF sets the strongUserTypes1strong, too... Maybe there is a way to stop this behaviorp

Negative 27478 pIm just learning regular expressions so I could use some help on this topic regarding the validation of phone numbers.p  pI have a phone input that is divided into one select list with country codes prefixed with a  sign. If a user forgets to remove the preceding zero in the phone number it wont be in accordance to the E.164 international standard There are however a handful of countries that are an exception to this rule, i.e. Italy, Norway etc. But the majority needs to omit the zero for a valid international phone number. p  pIn my albeit limited research, Ive realized that phone number formats vary significantly across the world. This means the validation needs to be loose rather than strict and allow for any combination of dashes, spaces, parenthesis, dots and forward slashes as delimiters between numbers. To fit the E.164 standard the delimiters will then be replaced by empty strings to give an example result like this code44755222333codep  pThis is my attempt thus far for validating any number.p  precodepregmatch[09][.s], phonenumber codepre  pHow would you compose a regular expression to negate preceding zeros i.e return a false match in presence of the string character 0 or 00, coupled with the flexibility to validate any possible telephone number notation p  pSincerely, Whyp  pP.S Just to check. Does the no zero rule apply for NANP numbers as well Im asking this because I assume the majority of the people here are familiar with that telephone numbering system.p

Negative 27478 pIm using Mojarra 2.0.3 on JBoss 6.1.0 final. Im having a problem with the value setter method for an hselectBooleanCheckbox not being called if conditional rendering is specified in the tag. p  pSpecificallyp  pJSFp  precodelthselectBooleanCheckbox valuesomebean.checked renderedsomebean.render gt codepre  pp  pExample bean codep  precodeprivate Boolean checked  new Booleanfalse  public Boolean getChecked return checked  public void setCheckedBoolean checked this.checked  checked  public boolean getRender return true codepre  pThe problem is that the setChecked method is never called when the form is submitted. If I remove the rendered attribute, the setter will be called as expected. Its only when the tag is conditionally rendered that it is not processed on submit. The getter is called normally in either case.p  pIf I set a valueChangeListener, this is also not invoked if the selectBooleanCheckbox is conditionally rendered. Finally, enclosing the hselectBooleanCheckbox tag in a container like an panelGrid and setting the conditional rendering on the outside component results in the same behavior. It seems that the checkbox wont be processed if it is conditionally rendered.p  pThis seems like kind of a basic thing, so Im assuming there is something Im missing. Does anyone have any similar experience with thisp  pUPDATE The managed bean in this case is a CDI ConversationScoped bean. Further debugging seemed to suggest that another instance of the bean instantiated and used somewhere in the JSF lifecycle. So I modified the bean to set the conversation to nontransient in the postConstruct method. This caused JSF to throw the following exception while evaluating the EL expression used in the rendered attributep  p234112,179 WARNING[javax.enterprise.resource.webcontainer.jsf.lifecycle] adminedituserprofile.xhtml 41,72 renderedprofileEditor.isCurrentUser java.lang.IllegalStateException javax.el.ELException adminedituserprofile.xhtml 41,72 renderedprofileEditor.isCurrentUser java.lang.IllegalStateException     at com.sun.faces.facelets.el.TagValueExpression.getValueTagValueExpression.java111 [2.0.3]     at javax.faces.component.ComponentStateHelper.evalComponentStateHelper.java190 [2.0.3]     at javax.faces.component.UIComponentBase.isRenderedUIComponentBase.java417 [2.0.3] . . .

Negative 27478 pThis question is strongNOTstrong about retainrelease things in iphone memory management. I understand the routine quite well and there is no memory leak things in my app.p  pI pop up the question shown in the title, when I use Activity Instruments to monitor the overall memory activity of my app.p  pThe instrument always shows that the amount of real memory, which my app is using, keeps being between 21 MB and 30MB, never higher. I think this amount is relatively not big. However, sometimes, my app will give level 1 or 2 memory warning never crash and I dont do anything for this warning in my code.p  pso I am wondering whats really behind iphone memory thing. I mean, does real memory the only things that triggers warnings or there is anything else such as virtual memory, as shown in the Instruments inside the whole memory I should take care ofp  pAlthough my app never crash due to memory issues, this warning thing especially level 2 warning really annoys me and makes me fear of crashing once I release it to public in the future.p  pAny helpp  pThanksp

Negative 27478 pI want to write a function which takes a list and constructs a subset of that list of a certain length based on the output of a function.  p  pIf I were simply interested in the first 50 elements of the sorted list xs, then I would use codefst splitAt 50 sort xs.codep  pHowever, the problem is that elements in my list rely on other elements in the same list.  If I choose element p, then I MUST also choose elements q and r, even if they are not in the first 50 elements of my list.  I am using a function finderFunc which takes an element a from the list xs and returns a list with the element a and all of its required elements.  finderFunc works fine.  Now, the challenge is to write a function which builds a list whose total length is 50 based on multiple outputs of finderFunc.p  pHere is my attempt at thisp  precodefinish  [a] gt [a] gt [a] This is the base case, which adds nothing to the final list finish [] fs  [] The function is recursive, so the fs variable is necessary so that finish    can forward the incomplete list to itself. finish ps fs      If the final list fs is too small, add elements to it      length fs lt 50 ampamp length fs  newrs lt 50  fs  finish newps newrs      If the length is met, then add nothing to the list and quit      length fs gt 50  finish [] fs      These guard statements are currently lacking, not the main problem      otherwise  finish [] fs     where         Sort the candidate list         sortedps  sort ps         finderFunc a returns a list of type [a] containing a and all the            elements which are required to go with it.  This is the interesting            bit.  rs is also a subset of the candidate list ps.         rs  finderFunc head sortedps         Remove those elements which are already in the final list, because           there can be overlap         newrs  filter notElem fs rs         Remove the elements we will add to the list from the new list            of candidates         newps  filter notElem rs ps codepre  pI realize that the above if statements will, in some cases, not give me a list of exactly 50 elements.  This is not the main problem, right now.  The problem is that my function finish does not work at all as I would expect it to.  Not only does it produce duplicate elements in the output list, but it sometimes goes far above the total number of elements I want to have in the list.p  pThe way this is written, I usually call it with an empty list, such as codefinish xs []code, so that the list it builds on starts as an empty list.  p

Negative 27478 pI was hoping someone could help a noobie out.p  pI am trying to create an iPhoneiPad app that uses tabs as its main navigation.

These table views are unrelated to each other, each using different tables from the database strongsqlitestrong.p  pTo illustrate this lets say tab 1 is the apps Home, tab 2 lists your grocery list, tab 3 lists recipes and tab 4 lists coupons available. They all fit together in the app but they come from completely different tables. Each navigation controller that appears on each tab is Completely different. Im using it like secondary navigation within the tab.p  pSo my question is, does anyone have strongany tutorials that illustrates this techniquestrong And if not do I have to create a different fetchedResultsController for each tab I started the project using the Tabbed application template, I then created another dummy project using the master detail template and added the master detail code and xibs to my tabbed project. So I now have tabs that display the generic time stamp entity that comes with the master detail template however I cannot seem to get the tabs to display different data.p  pAlso how can I create a navigation controller for each table view  tab All of the documentation says to initialize it inside of the AppDelegate however if I put it there how can I get a different controller for each tab Do I declare 34 controllers in the app delegate and some how assign them to each table view I have not seen an example of this anywhere even though it makes sense. strongTutorials would be much appreciated.strongp  pemstrongThank you so much in advance.emstrong Im just stuck here. p

Negative 27478 pEDIT I solved 2 below by simply changing the background of the TextViews parent ScrollView.p  pIve been googling all day, but just cant seem to find the answer to this.  This should be simple.p  pMy activity contains a fragment that is made up of a Tabbed control TabHost, TabWidgets, etc..  On each tab is a simple, scrolling TextView.  The idea is to have a few tabs with different categories of text that the user can scroll through.  Ive been able to set up the tabs and such, but have 2 problems that I cant seem to solve.p  p1 I cant figure out how to change the contents of a tabs TextView programmatically from the Activity that owns the fragment.  Ive tried creating a FragmentManager inside my host activity, finding the fragment, casting the fragment to my fragment class, then calling a function inside the fragment class that is supposed to change the text.  This function simply does thisp  precodeTextView textView  TextViewtabHost.getTabWidget.getChildAttabNumber.findViewByIdR.id.dashboardfragment4textView     iftextViewnull textView.setTexttext codepre  pThis doesnt work textView always returns as null.p  p2 A layout issue, I believe. My TextView on each tab doesnt fill the parent it just wraps the text content.  This is not a huge deal, but I want the entire screen area available to the TextView to have a particular background color. Maybe theres a better way to handle this Like having the TextViews background transparent, and then having something behind the TextView with the right color  I dont know....Im reaching.  p  pHeres the xml layout for each tabp  precodeltTabHost   xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid         androidididtabHost        androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightmatchparent        gt ltLinearLayout androidorientationhorizontal               androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt     ltTabWidget androididandroididtabs                 androidlayoutheightmatchparent                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                androidgravityleft                                   androidlayoutweight0 gt     ltFrameLayout androididandroididtabcontent                  androidlayoutheightmatchparent                   androidlayoutwidth0dp                  androidlayoutweight1gt          ltScrollView             androidididdashboardfragment4scrollView             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightmatchparent gt              ltTextView                 androidididdashboardfragment4textView                 androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidbackgroundcolorLinen                 androidtextColorcolorBlack                 androidtextSize20dp                 androidtextTextView gt          ltScrollViewgt      ltFrameLayoutgt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pp  pThanks for any suggestionsp  pBryanp

What throws the exception Im using the same guid I used for the traditional, satelliteassembly way. Is the guid not marshalled correctly How can I make it workp  hr  pFor completeness sake I managed to accomplish this. My method was to look at the AxHost source code used ILSpy and see what it does when creating an instancep  precodeprivate object GetOcxCreate      if this.instance  null              this.CreateInstance         this.RealizeStyles         this.AttachInterfaces         this.oleSite.OnOcxCreate          return this.instance  codepre  pThen I create an instance of the  generated AxMyControl class and replaced the codeinstancecode private field via reflection. That field originally gets a value by calling codeCoCreateInstancecode from codeCreateInstancecode. Then I called the other methods to fix up other connections all of them are private, so again, reflection. If the class is not registered, an exception is thrown in the constructor CoCreateInstance fails, so I do this machination in a finally block. p  pSo far, it seems to work fine. p

Negative 27478 pFor research purposes, I am trying to modify H.264 motion vectors MVs for each P and Bframe prior to motion compensation during the decoding process. I am using FFmpeg for this purpose. An example of a modification is replacing each MV with its original spatial neighbors and then using the resultant MVs for motion compensation, rather than the original ones. Please direct me appropriately.p  pSo far, I have been able to do a simple modification of MVs in the file stronglibavcodech264cavlc.cstrong. In the function, strongffh264decodembcavlcstrong, modifying the strongmxstrong and strongmystrong variables, for instance, by increasing their values modifies the MVs used during decoding.p  pFor example, as shown below, the strongmxstrong and strongmystrong values are increased by 50, thus lengthening the MVs used in the decoder.p  precodemx  getsegolombampsgtgb50 my  getsegolombampsgtgb50 codepre  pHowever, in this regard, I dont know how to access the neighbors of strongmxstrong and strongmystrong for my spatial mean analysis that I mentioned in the first paragraph. I believe that the key to doing so lies in manipulating the array, strongmvcachestrong.p  pAnother experiment that I performed was in the file, stronglibavcodecerrorresilience.cstrong. Based on the strongguessmvstrong function, I created a new function, strongmeanmvstrong that is executed in strongfferframeendstrong within the first ifstatement. That first ifstatement exits the function strongfferframeendstrong if one of the conditions is a zero errorcount serrorcount  0. However, I decided to insert my strongmeanmvstrong function at this point so that is always executed when there is a zero errorcount. This experiment somewhat yielded the results I wanted as I could start seeing artifacts in the top portions of the video but they were restricted just to the upperright corner. Im guessing that my inserted function is not being completed so as to meet playback deadlines or something.p  pBelow is the modified ifstatement.

But this page is really only for use on one computer to allow live display of results at a sports competition so if a greasemonkey script, or a bookmarklet, can be written that will access the iframe and only the iframe, that would be good enough for me.

Negative 27478 pI have a asp .net web pageMVC displaying 10,000 products.p  pFor this I am using a method. In that method I have to call an external web service 20 times. This is because the web service gives me 500 data at a time, so to get 10000 data I need to call the service 20 times.p  p20 calls makes the page load slow. Now I need to increase the performance. Since web service is external I cannot make changes there.p  pThreading is an option I thought of. Since I can use page numbers service is paging for the data each service call is almost independent.p  pAnother option is using parallel linq.p  pShould I use parallel linq, or choose threadingp  pSomeone please guide me here. Or let me know another way to achieve this.p  pNote  this web page can be used by many users at a time.p  pWe have filters left side of the page.for that we need all the 10,000 data to construct filter.Otherwise pagewise info could have been enough.and caching is not possible since the huge overload on the server. at a time 4001000 users can hit server.web service response time is 10 second so that we can hit them many timep  pWe have to hit the service 20 times to get all data.Now i need a solution to improve that hit.Is threading is the only optionp

Negative 27478 pI need to test my console application with example input data, stored in a file. I want this file to be executed when I start my application in Visual Studio. In normal situation, in command prompt I write program.exe lt input.txt , the program is executed, I get the results and the screen prompt waits. I have found in Visual Studio that I can write this lt input.txt in ProjectPropertiesDebugCommand Line Arguments and when I hit F5 I can see that the program gives me the results, but the command window closes immediately. How can I hold this Window I tried CtrlF5, but it doesnt load my input.txt file. Also the application is going to be send to another test system, so I should not write any Console.Read ReadLine, Readkey... methods in the end of the file, because I think this will mess things up. I need answers for this problem for Visual Studio 2010 2008, 2005 and languages CC, C if possible.p

Negative 27478 pIve been searching for hours and havent been able to find anything remotely similar to this question, even though im sure it must have been done before p  pThe user first types in a combination of numbers and  signs. E.g 5  7413  11. I have a class Add and a class Subtract, the program builds a tree of these two classes from the input. So in this example the tree would look something likep  precodeAdd 5      Subtract 7      11        Add 4                3    1 codepre  pNow each class has a recursive StepEvaluate method which first prints to the console the entire sum. So for the Subtract subtree of the previous example, that object would print 7  41  3. It would then list each node of the tree and ask a user to click a branch to addsubtract to the running total of initially 0. It would finally Print the answer at the end. So if we take 5  73  11, the output to the console would bep  precode5  73  11 We are going to add to the total with each choice. The current total is 0. Choose from the following 5  73  11 You chose 11 The current total is 11. Choose from the following 5  73 You chose 73     7  3     We are going to subtract from the total with each choice.     The current total is 0.     Choose from the following     7          3     You chose 3     The current total is 3.     The only remaining choice is 7.     The current total is 4.     So the answer is 4. The current total is 15. The only remaining choice is 5. The current total is 20. So the answer is 20. codepre  pNow my console is a textbox. In the form constructor, a new thread, Eval, is made to evaluate and output the above results. Each time the user presses the button, it resumes the thread Eval and pauses the current thread. Eval then works out the next string to output using the recursive classes above, writes the string to a static variable, resumes execution of the main thread and pauses execution of Eval. The main thread then reads those static variables and outputs it to the textbox producerconsumer. In between button clicks, the inputs by the user are written to static variables so Eval can read these once resumed.p  pI want to have another button on the form which will go back a line. If this erases the line You chose A then the user can change his choice, so the next output can be You chose B.p  pI have read up on the memento and command patterns, and know about state based and action based undoredo. However I have no clue how to implement this with the above recursion and producerconsumer threads. All I really need is a way to make the point of execution of Eval go back a line.

Negative 27478 pI stumbled on aichallenge.org last week and I thought this Ants game was a good way to both learn Python and learn to code AI.  p  pThe game is a x,y grid  which can contain up to one ant.  Tiles can be denoted as land or water, which is impassable.p  pMy AI is doing a good job, sending ants to collect food through a breadthfirst search algorithm and attacking enemy hills using A pathfinding.p  pHowever, the algorithm I am trying to implement for exploration is taking way too much time, about 700 ms.  My AI is only allowed 500 ms per turn, which means it is disqualified.p  pTo perform exploration, I want to assign an ExploreValue to each tiles.  This value starts at 0 at the start of the game and increases by 1 every turn the tile is hidden under the fog of war.  When a tile is visible, I want the explore value to be reset to 0.  Each ants has a sight radius of 10 squares.p  pFirst, I run a breadthfirst search from each ant to tag tiles as visible.  This takes about 10 ms per ant After that, I iterate through every tile on the map to update their ExploreValue.  If they are tagged as visible then the value is reset to 0, else it is increased by one.p  pThis takes more than half a second on maps that must be about 100x100.p  pHere is the code, what do you think I could do to make this run faster I already converted my lists to sets since they are supposed to be faster.p  pdef dosetup is run once at the start of the game, def doturn is run every turn in the game.p  precodedef dosetupself, ants   self.tilevisible  set     self.explorevalue       for row in rangeants.rows      for col in rangeants.cols         self.explorevalue[row, col]0   def doturnself, ants     self.tilevisible  []  empty visible list  Define visible tiles set     antstilesscandistance10      for ant in ants.myants start bfs of length antstilescandistance         tilesdist   dict visited tiles         tilesfrom   dict previous tiles         fromnodes[]         fromnodes.appendant         tonodes[]         closefriendscount[ant]0          steps1         while stepsltantstilesscandistance and lenfromnodesgt1             for fromnode in fromnodes                 for newloc in ants.tilesvoisins[fromnode]                      if newloc not in tilesdist                         tilesdist[newloc]steps                         tonodes.appendnewloc                          if newloc not in self.tilevisible                             self.tilevisible.appendnewloc              fromnodestonodes             tonodes[]             stepssteps1   Update ExploreValues       for tile in self.explorevalue.keys          if tile in self.tilevisible             self.explorevalue[tile]0         else             self.explorevalue[tile]self.explorevalue[tile]1 codepre

I want to keep it very simple though, and dont want to use codematplotlib.animationcode. Is there some simple method without using many more modules and libraries only stuff like codeplt.pausecode and perhaps only a bit more that will let me do what I wantp  pI looked at many places online, and the problem I face with most methods there is that I am using pythonx,y thats python version 2.7 on Windows for this, and animations using too complicated modules and libraries are crashing here. p  pHowever, I am able to run simple stuff like a hrefhttpmatplotlib.sourceforge.netexamplesanimationrandomdata.html relnofollowthis examplea on the matplotlib site, which is close to what I want, but not quite. So perhaps the best thing will be a modification of this example that works for my case of 2D data that example is for a 1D row. But any other suggestion is welcome.p

Negative 27478 pI am making a small program that reads a text file and stores it in the memory. It then lets the user add another line to the file, replace a line, add another word at a specific line etc... p  pAt the end the user can save the content from the memory back to the file. I did the same program in Python and used a multidimensional array, so each element in the array was an array of words. This made it really easy to access a specific word at a specific line to be replaced with something elsep  pNow I am trying to do the same thing with C and getting confused. After a little bit of messing around I am leaning more towards having a structure that has char words[]. This way I can delete a specific line by just dereferencing the NextNode from the previous to next.p  pI have two questions tho 1. Is this a good way of accomplishing my goal 2.

Negative 27478 pI have a problem that has been driving me crazy and Id appreciate any thoughts you guys may have to offer. I import data from a CSV file using openCSV into a database, and previously this process has been completed in about 35 seconds including the download time from a server. The CSV file has 3035 records. Ive tried separating the parsing from CSV and inserting to the table, but to no avail.p  pAs strange as it may sound suddenly something has changed within my application where now this process takes much much longer.p  pAfter narrowing it down Ive found that inserting into the table is extremely slow for SQLite. Ive spent the last couple hours reverting back to older code to see if something has changed but to no luck. p  pI came across some similar question whose answer suggest me to use InsertHelper, which I did. Which made absolutely no difference in the import time.

Negative 27478 pMy question is in regards to what is considered best practice in web development. I have been concentrating on web apps, javascript web apps in particular so my general practice is to load the html, use ajax to pull in the data I need from a database, and build the view dynamically. So naturally I am used to storing my page content in a database.p  pThis is great for things like blog posts, or small amounts of data like phone numbers and email addresses that I want to display, but what about what would normally be static content Say a marketing front page that displays content about the backend web app It would be nice to keep this all on one page even though its not search engine friendly and use javascript transitions to display the data, but this would require either building a bunch of divs and hiding the ones not in view, or pulling the data from the database as required. What about mixed content types like maybe a faq list, then separate paragraphs of general data, etc.p  pHow is this type of thing normally accomplished p

Negative 27478 pSo I am making a registration page in ASP.NET MVC and theres a list of fields which changes depending on a number of conditions taken from a database. p  pWhat would be considered the best approach for displaying these fields on a view without code changes each time the DB is updated. p  pThe current system I am thinking about is making a Dictionary with Name, DataType then just iterating through the list and putting a new input type of each name using a switch for data type to get the correct editor. But it seems like a old fashioned and not fully utilizing the benefits of the .NET MVC system such as validation, default values, customized editors for specific content. p  pIs there a approach I may possibly be not aware of in .NET to handle this problem p

Negative 27478 pSo this is a very specific question for SlickGrid, but I was wondering if anyone has ever tried to change the way the rows look when grouped  I was thinking that it would be cool to add a border around the grouped rows to show that they are part of that heading.  p  pThe way that SlickGrid works doesnt give any indication the rows are grouped in the DOM, they just appear under the header.  I have tried to do something like thisp  precodedataView.getItemMetadata  functionindex       return cssClasses myRowCssClass                          codepre  pbut unfortunately, this broke other things in terms of the grouping.  There is some stuff in the native codegetItemMetadatacode function that the groupBy function needs to process.  I could copy that stuff into this function and add a condition for this, but that doesnt seem right.  Does anyone who has some experience with SlickGrid know how to achieve this effect p

Negative 27478 pI can access and view RTSP streams from IP cameras on Android via the VideoView component without problems.p  pNow I need to play the RTSP stream with a delay i.e. if I specify a 30 second delay, the playback on screen should be 30 seconds behind the source and the delay needs to be variable though not during playback, only at the point of connecting to the source.p  pI originally thought this would not be a problem as I could simply change the RTSP buffer duration before connecting to the camera but unfortunately it seems the buffer size is baked into the firmware and cannot be changed in software.

Negative 27478 pI have a problem with the creation of VAOs on iOS. Sometimes it works just fine, and glGenVertexArraysOES returns a nonzero VAO via the second argument, but other times, it simply returns zero and no error via glGetErrorp  pI have two cases. One works, the other doesnt. Theyre both in initialisation code, and theyre both more or less the same codep  pWorkingp  precodeglGenBuffers1, ampmvertexBufferObject errorCheck  GLuint vao  0 glGenVertexArraysOES1, ampvao errorCheck glBindVertexArrayOESvao errorCheck  vao set up goes here  vao  0 codepre  pNot workingp  precodeglBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, 0 glBindBufferGLELEMENTARRAYBUFFER, 0 glBindVertexArrayOES0  errorCheck GLuint vao  0 glGenVertexArraysOES1, ampvao errorCheck glBindVertexArrayOESvao errorCheck  vao  0 codepre  pThe glBind functions in the nonworking block are largely just an attempt to fix the problem by mitigating any previously bound state. It didnt help.p  pThe code is multithreaded. I have one context, and only one thread is permitted to use it at one time by way of a mutex. When a thread acquires the context, I lock the mutex and call setCurrentContext. I restore the current context to nil afterwards. I believe this should be an acceptable multithreading setup from what Ive read elsewhere. In any case, disabling threading and running everything on the same thread makes no differencep  pThe successful case happens right at the start, at initialisation time. That works fine... the other case happens during loading time, whilst a render loop is going on but still being marshalled by said critical sections and context assignments, and thats the case that fails.p  pIm basically assuming there must be some sort of precondition to glGenVertexArrayOESs execution that isnt being met. I dont think its really the body of the VAO set up in the latter case, I think its something that happens between the successful initial VAO setups, and the later attempted set ups.p  pIt fails on both the sim and the phone, so theres clearly something going on... yet, its a silent error, so its giving me no angle to investigate. It works just fine on OpenGL for OS X. Furthermore, attempts to replicate the error or similar conditions eg, the threading in various pieces of sample code have failed.p  pAny ideasp  pThanks.p

Negative 27478 pI have a panel with a JTabbedpane and in every tab you can set parameters to execute a query. When one query is busy retrieving his data from the database, you can already open a new tab to set the new parameters. To avoid overload on the database only one query may be executed at once. But when you click execute the program must remember which queries to execute in the right order. During the execution a loader icon is shown and the GUI may not be frozen, because there is a stop button you can click to stop the execution. br I used a swingworker to avoid the GUI from blocking while executing the query and that works fine.

Negative 27478 pBRIEF is it ever safe to dop  precode namespace Foo   include bar   codepre  pBefore you blithely say no, I think I have some rules that allow it fairly safely.p  pBut I dont like them, since they require the includer to separately include all global scope headers needed.  Although this mightr be tolerable, if we imagine including within a namespace to be just a special management feature.p  pAnd overall, externs and forward declarations just dont work well from within namespaces.p  pSo I gues I am askingp  pa What other gotchasp  pb is there a better wayp  pstrong A [[Headeronly library]] strongp  pI like writing libraries.  [[Headeronly libraries and linker libraries]].p  pE.g.p  precodeinclude Valid.hpp codepre  pdefines a template Valid, for a simple wrapper type.  p  pDont get bogged down in You should use some standard library for this rather than your own.  This is an exanple. I dunno if Boost or C have yet standardized this.  I have been using wrappers since templates were added to C.p  pAlso, let us say, it is a header only library, that defines, in Valid.hpp, a print functionp  pstdstring tostring const Validamp v         stdostringstream oss       if v.valid   oss ltlt v        else  invalid        return oss.str   p  pAnd because I think it is the right thing to do,  I have Valid.hpp include the headers it depends onp  precode   Valid.hpp           include ltiostreamgt          include ltsstreamgt           templatelttypename Tgt           class Valid           private            T value            bool valid            ...                     ...           stdstring tostring const ValidltTgtamp v   ... codepre  pSo far, so good.p  pI can use Valid straightforwardly.p  pstrong Name collision  trying to use include within namespace to work around strongp  pBut sometimes there is a collision. Sometimes somebody else has their own Valid.p  pNamespaces to the rescue, right  But I dont want to change all of my existing code to use the namespace. So, I am tempted, in a new project that has a collision, to dop  precode   namespace AG      namespace Wrapper      include libAGWrapperValid.hpp                AGWrapperValidltTgt foov       ... codepre  pPROBLEM  the headers included are no longer freestanding.  Everything defined inside  is no placed inside  namespace AGWrapper.p  pIts not hard to fix.br Al we must do is include all the top level libraries that Valid.hpp depends on. If they have include guards, they will not be reincluded.p  precode   include ltiostreamgt     include ltsstreamgt      namespace AG      namespace Wrapper      include libAGWrapperValid.hpp                AGWrapperValidltTgt foov       ... codepre  pBut it is no longer freestanding.  p  pWorse, sometimes the headeronly library contains extern declarations and forward declarations of stuff outside itself. These declarations get placed inside the namespace too.  In particular, if the extern declarayion is inside a function defined in the namespace.p  pI.e. sometimes we use extern and forward declarations, rather than included an entire header file. These get included in the namespace.p  pQ is there a better wayp  pstrong  doesnt do it strongp  pHint    doesnt do it.  At least not all the time, not in gcc 4.7.2.br Gccs behavior in this has changed over time.  Gcc 4.1.2 behaved differently.p  pE.g.p  precode Type var   namespace Foo   void bar      extern Type      var     extern Type      Foobar     extern Typefoo      bar   see the ambiguity   codepre  pBut its not just the ambiguity.p  pint varp  precode namespace Foo   void bar      extern int var   codepre  pworks  Foobarsvar is equal to var.p  pBut it only works because of the declaration outside the namespace.p  pThe following doesnt workp  pheader      int var   cpp       namespace Foo       void bar          extern int var            p  palthough the following doesp  pheader      int var   cpp       void bar          extern int var            p  pBasically, what this amounts to saying is that  it is not a trivial refactoring to put functions inside a namespace. Wrapping a namespace around a chunk of code, whether or not it is included, is not a sufficient. ... at least not if there are extern or forward declarations.p  pAnd even if you p  pstrong Opinion against putting includes within namespaces strongp  pStackoverflow folks seem to be against putting includes inside namespacesp  pE.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8760711howtouseclassdefinedinaseparateheaderwithinanamespace87612788761278How to use class defined in a separate header within a namespaceap  blockquote ... you should never write a include inside a namespace. Where never means, unless youre doing something really obscure that I havent thought of and that justifies it. You want to be able to look at a file, and see what the fullyqualified names are of all the things in it.

Negative 27478 pI am new to using Startclusterqsubgrid engine to run parallel jobs and I tried reading couple of other posts regarding the same. I still am not sure of how to build a scalable solution for my specific requirement. I would like to take in some more suggestions before I proceed with the same.p  pHere are my requirementsp  ol lipI have a huge tar file [40  50 GB and it can go up to 100GB]  There is not much I can do here. I have accept that a huge single tar file as input.pli lipI have to untar and uncompress it  I run tar xvf tarfilename.tar  parallel pbzip d to untar and uncompress the same. pli lipThe output of this uncompression is say few hundred thousand files, approx 500,000 files.pli lipThis uncompressed files have to processed. I have modular code that can take in every single file and process it and output 5 different files.pli ol  pTar File Parallel Uncompression Uncompressed Files Parallel Processing  5 output files per file processedp  ol lipI currently have a parallel python script which runs on a 16 cores, 16GB memory taking in this list of uncompressed files and processing the same in parallel.pli lipThe problem is how do I seamlessly scale. For example, if my code has been say running for 10 hours and I would like to add one more 8 core machine to it, I cannot do it in parallel python as I would have to know the number of processors in advance. pli lipAt the same time, when I dynamically add more nodes to the currently cluster, how about the data accessibility and readwrite operationspli ol  pSo, I went about reading and doing basic experimentation with starcluster and qsub. While I see I can submit multiple jobs via qsub, How will I make it to take the input files from the uncompressed input folderp  pFor example, Can I write a script.sh which in for loop pick the file names one by one and submit the same to qsub command Is there another efficient solutionp  pSay, if have 3 machines with 16 CPUs each, and if I submit 48 jobs to the queue, will the qsub launch them automatically in different CPUs of the clusters or will I have to use Parallel environment parameters like np orte command set the number of CPUs in each cluster respectively. Is it necessary to make my python script MPI executablep  pAs a summary, I have a few hundred thousand files as input, I would like to submit them to a job queues to multi core machines. If I dynamically add more machines, the jobs should automatically be distributed. p  pAnother major challenge is I need all the output of the 500,000 odd operations to be aggregated at the end Is there a suggestion on how to aggregate output of parallel jobs as and when output is written outp  pI am test running few scenarios but I would like to know if there are people who have experimented on similar scenarios.p  pAny suggestions using Hadoop Plugin a hrefhttpstar.mit.educlusterdocs0.93.3pluginshadoop.html relnofollowhttpstar.mit.educlusterdocs0.93.3pluginshadoop.htmlap  pThanks in Advance Karthickp

Negative 27478 pI am developing a static library that needs to do some stuff in the background, without interacting with the main thread. To give you an idea, think of just logging some user events. The library must keep doing this stuff until the user exits the app or sends it to the background pushes the home button  in other words it needs to keep doing stuff inside a loop. p  pThe only interaction between the main app thread and the spawned thread is that occasionally the main app thread will put some stuff an event object into a queue that the spawned thread can readconsume. Other than that, the spawned thread just keeps going until the app exists or backgrounds.p  pPart of what the spawned thread needs to do though not all of it involves sending data to an HTTP server. I would have thought that it would be easy to subclass NSThread, override its main method, and just make a synchronous call to NSUrlConnection with some sort of timeout on that connection so the thread doesnt hang forever. For example, in JavaAndroid, we just subclass Thread, override the start method and call a synchronous HTTP GET method say from Apaches HttpClient class. This is very easy and works fine. But from what I have seen here and elsewhere, apparently on iOS it is much more complicated than this and Im more than a bit confused as to what the best approach is that actually works.p  pSo should I subclass NSThread and somehow use NSUrlConnection It seems the asynchronous NSUrlConnection does not work inside NSThread because delegate methods dont get called but what about the synchronous method Do I somehow need to use and configure the RunLoop and set up an autorelease pool Or should I use an NSOperation It seems to me that what I am trying to do is pretty common  does anyone have a working example of how to do this properlyp

The problem with doing it this way is that this is a script for developers to be able to manually sync files to their application folder. We have multiple servers for each instance that is randomly picked by BigIP. So just writing to the C drive would only copy the file to the server the developer is currently accessing. So if the developer were to close out the browser and go right back in to make sure their changes worked, if they happen to get sent to a different server, they wont see their change. p  pSince it works with writing to C, I know the permissions are correct. Ive also copied the path out of the error message and put it in the address bar on the server and it got to the folderfile fine. What else could be stopping it from being able to access that serverp

Negative 27478 pstrongUpdatestrong My problem was caused by two functions returning and not just one. The callback function in the code.eachcode loop was generating the returns in the codeifelsecode block. Even though I link it later in the question, there is a good question about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7391493isthereanywaytonotreturnsomethingusingcoffeescripthow to override returnsa when CoffeeScript compiles to JavaScript.

Negative 27478 pIm writing a class where I would like to have some member methods that have some data associated with them, specifically which mechanical systems of a robot they require use of.

I could make a corresponding private method for each command and initialize them with a function pointer instead of a lambda, but that just seems more convoluted. I could also subclass codeCommandcode for each specific command and thereby have the body and requirements in a separate file for each one, but that feels like a lot of overhead for a fairly simple task. Is there a good way to do this that Im not aware ofp

Negative 27478 pThis really should be a simple question, and I apologize but I just cant seem to find the answer. From my understanding you can take in an object and have it use say a bean in Java EE to produce this ObjectEntity into a database. Now the problem is the ID is going to be autogenerated so the client will not know this when first being created. How do I return with the POST in JaxRS what there now provided URIID location is so they know who they are provided that ID after being created. I have read and thought this was possible but maybe I am wrong, if someone could point me in the direction of my solution. p

Negative 27478 pI hope this is a clearer description of what I want to achieve.p  pI just did a copy and paste values only and it did the operation for me. I was hoping a macro might speed the process up a bit. Essentially I want to copy cells 2,4,6,8,10....48 from column D in a particular workbook and paste the values into cells 23,24,25....46 in column J in a second workbook. The next step is to copy cells 3,5,7,9.....49 from column D in the first workbook and paste the values only into cells 23,24,25....46 in column X in the second workbook. Obviously I could copy and paste these but I have thousands of these to do and was hoping a macro could help.p

So i thought that i create an object and it keeps those values, doesnt overwrite them, but adds new values to previously and was totally puzzled why suddenly it ignores the filter, thats why i tried to empty the object by putting delete window.obj, but it didnt do a thing.

Negative 27478 pI have a general question about Amazon and making the product image files public.p  pCurrently, my codeconfig.fogpublic  falsecode which makes my files private.  This is not an issue on the website as people are able to view the images, etc.p  pThe issue arose when I used AddThis to share the product page.  The image is uploaded to the facebook share dialog box and everything is fine.  But, the image of the product disappears from the image portion of the share dialog after about a week or two.  p  pI did some research and realized its because if i change the line from codeconfig.fogpublic  falsecode to codeconfig.fogpublic  truecode, then all my files are public and things should work.p  pI am just curious as to what the repercussions of doing this is.  Can someone else change the product image of the file since this is public access now  Or is this standard if you want to share the image across the webp  pThanks.p

Negative 27478 pMy requirement is to measure the request and response bandwidth of a webapp thats deployed in Tomcat. Basically capture each request and response bandwidth and store the statistics and do analytics on that data overtime. p  pWeve already written a custom Tomcat Valve to capture plenty of information regarding requests coming to a webapp. Since both request and response go through the Valve, I think there should be a way to capture bandwidth stats in the Valve, but havent found out how to do it.p  pOne thing weve done previously is to get this information using the Tomcat RequestInfo.java class. This however doesnt seem like a clean solution. While digging into the tomcat code, I noticed that we can get the org.apache.coyote.Request object thats used in RequestInfo class as followsp  precodeorg.apache.catalina.connector.request.getCoyoteRequest.getBytesRead  org.apache.catalina.connector.request.getCoyoteRequest.getResponse.getContentWritten codepre  pBut both the above statement always returns 0, which is wrong compared to the output in RequestInfo class.p  pAny idea on what could be the issue Why the coyote.Request is not returning the correct bandwidth in the Valve Is there a better way to capture requestresponse bandwidth, with or without a Valve p

The background is to be the composition of three circles, each with different dynamically set colors.p  ul lipone circle, the largest, is actually a perimeter i.e. strokepli lipone circle, the second largest, is concentric with the perimetric circlepli lipone circle, the smallest, sits at the base of the other two circles so that it is not concentric.pli ul  pI successfully create the 3circle background using codelayerlistcode. But the problem is that I am not able to change the colors in the codelayerlistcode dynamically. Changing the color of these circles is a crucial part of the design.p  pSo since my ImageView is part of a custom view anyway, I am now thinking of using the canvas in codeonDrawCanvas canvascode to create my three circles and set them as the background of the ImageView. However, the problem with this approach is that I dont know how to set my composite image the three circles as the background of my ImageView.p  pAny snippet of code solving this problem is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 27478 pI am looking for a tool or technique to help share media with a small group of users. Let me first describe roughly what the ideal solution would do for me. p  ol liHandle large files binary, such as HD home movies and photos. li liAllow only authenticated users to access the content.li liContent will be downloaded to the users computer. It will not be streamed or accessed via a cloud. This will make the best use of limited bandwidth.li liSychronize content in the background or via simple command if required so every user just gets new content as its added.li liIf one user renames a file, alters the directory structure, etc. it is seen by all other users after their next sync.li liWork with huge data sets on the order of 100s of gigabytes. The only limit should be the disk space available on a users machine.li liAllow users to synchronize only a subset of the total data set e.g. only the photos directory, ignoring the home videos folder if desired. Especially important for those with small hard drives.li ol  pInitially I thought of a simple rsync type solution such as a hrefhttpwww.crashplan.com relnofollowCrashPlana which allows you to backup your files to your friends PC. While this meets most of the requirements, namely allow the friend to access the files and having the sync occur in the background, it does not provide a method for said friend to merge new content into the data set. You would have to set up a two way backup. This just becomes unwieldy as the number of users increase.p  pMy next thought was using Git. It has documented problems with large file sizes and I dont really want all prior versions of binary files. During this research I came across a hrefhttpcode.google.compboar relnofollowBoara. This very interesting package is the closest I have come yet. It handles nearly all the requirements. The only issue I see with Boar is that it is intended to maintain a central repository. If a friend adds content, it gets committed to the server, where everyone else must go to get it. Since I would want each user to have a complete copy of the data set, each user would have to check out every file to retrieve it from the Boar server. This is against the Boar design as it is expressely not a distributed version control system. By design you check out what you need, do your work, then check it back in without maintaing the whole repository on your local machine.p  pSo my question for the group is if there is any other tools or techniques I should be considering p

Negative 27478 pI have a problem where a table overflows its container.  There is one cell that contains a pre with dynamic content, and this cell causes the table to extend beyond its parent.  I think that all I need is to force it to wrap the lines so that the table doesnt overflow.  I triedp  precodepre.content      whitespace prewrap  codepre  pTo preserve white space as well as wrap the content, but this seems to insert breaks only after a word has already extended beyond its bounds.  I want it to wrap a word before it leaves the container.  I realize that I could break midword with codewordwrap breakwordcode but this makes it very hard to read.p  pIm still trying to learn all the in and outs of css so I might have a wrong diagnosis.  The table does not have a set width because I am assuming that the table should remain within its parent by default.  I am starting to think I am wrong.  I tried to set the width to 100 but then that seems to make all the cell widths equal which is not what I want.  So I figure getting the correct wrapping will fix the problem. Hopefully someone can help Thanks in advancep

Negative 27478 pIve build a springbased web project in Eclipse using Maven. Dependencies and class path are correct and the deployment assembly also lists springweb.jar correctly.

Negative 27478 pI always thought that when I am passing custom codeparcelablecode object, by calling codegetParcelablecode, it will return a totally new object.

Negative 27478 pIn strongMatlabstrong Ive got a 3D matrix over 100 frames 512x512. My goal is to find some representative points through the whole hypermatrix. To do so Ive implemented the traditional and not very efficient method I subdivide the large matrix into smaller submatrices and then I look for the pixel with the highest value. After doing that I change those relative coordinates of that very pixel in the submatrix to global coordinates referenced to the large matrix.p  pNow, Im redesigning the algorithm. Ive seen that in order to analyze a large matrix blockbyblock thats actually what Im doing with my old algorithm the strongBLOCKPROCstrong function is very efficient. Ive read the documentation but I dont know how the fun function should be implemented to extract that the pixel with the highest value of each block. Thank you in advance.p  pIm trying to get the coordinates of those maximum pixels referenced to the global matrix, I really dont care about their value.p

Negative 27478 pBasic Problem If I make an AJAX call to a controller method that performs a long computation 60 seconds or greater, I get a duplicate thread that comes in and follows the same path of execution as best as I can tell from stack trace dumps  and only one, this doesnt continue happening with the second thread.  This appears to only happen when the controller action is called via AJAX.  This can easily be replicated by creating a dummy controller method with nothing in it by a Thread.sleep call that returns when finished.p  pIve tested this in a method thats loaded without an AJAX call and it doesnt produce the rogue thread.  I tried various forms of AJAX calls several forms of jQuery methods and base JavaScript and got the same result with each.  I initially thought it might be a thread problem so I implemented the dummy method using Promises a hrefhttpwww.playframework.comdocumentation2.1.xJavaAsync relnofollowhttpwww.playframework.comdocumentation2.1.xJavaAsynca, and a hrefhttpwww.playframework.comdocumentation2.1.xJavaAkka relnofollowhttpwww.playframework.comdocumentation2.1.xJavaAkkaa and AsyncResult, but it had no effect.p  pI know that the two threads are using the same execution context.

Negative 27478 pIm trying to learn how to work with audio in as many different ways as possible.p  pGiven a known audio stream lets call it stream1 and an unknown audio stream stream2 which are mixed into one single stream mix1.p  pNow assuming that we know stream1 in advance but not stream2 would it be possible to use stream1 to cancel itself out of mix1 and therefore give us stream2 with a minimum of noiseinterferencep  pTo give it a real world context imagine a situation would be where your computer has a microphone and speakers not headphones and because the computer knows in advance ok, only milliseconds, but still the output to the speakers would it be possible to cancel that sound from the mix coming in on the microphone.

Negative 27478 pConsider this simple codeRCurlcode function to report download progressp    precodelibraryRCurl curlDownfunctionurl, followTRUE     xgetURLurl, followlocationfollow, noprogress  FALSE,         progressfunctionfunctiondown,up catdown, n      codepre  pNote that with codefollowlocationTRUEcode default we accept  to follow the possible redirect location that the server sends as part of the HTTP header.p  pWe getp  precodecurlDownhttpwww.example.com  0 0   1270 1079   1270 1127   1270 1270   1270 1270   1270 1270  codepre  pAs you can see the codedowncode variable passed to the callback by codeRCurlcode is a numeric vector, where the first element is the total download in bytes and the second is the running download size. Due to space constraints, I dont show this here, but upon separate inspection I saw the former is equivalent to the codeContentLengthcode field in the response header. p  pNot every server gives  the codeContentLengthcode field in the response headerp  precodecurlDownhttpwww.google.it  0 0    0 603  ... blah blah  0 44848   0 44848  codepre  pIn this case codeRCurlcode sets the missing total value to zero would codeNAcode have been better.p  pMain Google domain, .com redirects to a country specific domain, for example .it if you are querying from the country associated with this domain Italy.

Negative 27478 pI have to implement a grid of cells where the user must be able to select a specific cell through drag amp drop. The number of columns and rows is predefined 45 x 30 cells and the cell must be a square.

As you will see, the problem only occurs if the fluid span that contains the grid has a percentage width or a width like 847.23px. Since the bootstrap column codespan9code needs to be fluid I cant figure out to solve the problem.p  pI also tried to wrap my grid inside another div where I specify a non percentage width codeMath.floorcode on parents codefluid span9code width but with no effect.p

Negative 27478 pfor this project a hrefhttpbiduleohm.free.frledohm relnofollowhttpbiduleohm.free.frledohma sorry, the user interface is in french but the code is in english I need an angular gradient but it doesnt exists in native so Ive implemented it using a linear gradient on a line and I draw the lines more and more longer to form a triangle. The result is graphically OK but the speed isnt really good 1850 ms for 125 triangles.

Negative 27478 pI am trying to get a grip on modwsgi by writing a simple WSGI server running under Apache on Linux. However I notice that requests are not always served in the order in which they arrive, even if they come from the same clientbrowser.p  pIf a page e.g. contains images A and B respectively, A may be served as answer to the request for B, so it is shown at the wrong place. Im convinced I must be making a very trivial mistake, but I am unable to find out what.p  pI am aware that the WSGI callable must be reentrant, and by logging requests and responses, I see that indeed it is sometimes entered a second time before the first result is served.

Negative 27478 pIt seems that codeStateListDrawablecode will ignore color filters applied to the drawables they contain.

Negative 27478 pI have a parent view UIView, that contains 2 buttons UIButton. These buttons are always on the bottom of the parent view. Now, when I make animation for the parent view like increase its height, I want these 2 buttons should keep their previous relative position should be on the bottom.p  pIn the Size Inspector, I set the Origin of the button like p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comW5R6h.png altinspectorp  pHowever, it doesnt work. Is there any simple solution for that I dont want to write it in the code, because I have so many sub views, and want them keep their relative position in comparison to the parent view.

Negative 27478 pI am working through Programming in Scala and it says that you can override a parameterless method with a field, ad gives the following examplep  precodeabstract class Element      def contents Array[String]     val height Int  contents.length     val width Int  if height  0 0 else contents0.length   class ArrayElementconts Array[String] extends Element      val contentsArray[String]  conts   val a  ArrayHello, mom printlna0 val x  new ArrayElementa printlnx.contents printlnHello,   x.height codepre  pHowever this code produces a null pointer exception for me.  Replacing val contents with def contents works fine.  I cant really understand where the null pointer exception is coming from, if the contents array is indeed being correctly passed.  It seems to be coming from the val height  contents.length line, because replacing those with def height also runs correctly.  What am I not understanding about this examplep

I assume this should be trivial, but I just havent found how to do it. Note I am NOT working on standard text documents, so CountVectorizer and NaiveBayesnltk and the like do not help me.  I need a method to get the selected features, and preferably something to drop the unselected ones, for when I apply the models and selected features on new test data.p  pThank you very muchp  pMy data is currently loaded like thisp  precodeimport numpy as np import pandas as pd from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, LabelBinarizer  def loaddatafilenameFeatnormalized.csv      df  pd.readcsvfilename, indexcol0     lb  LabelEncoder     labels  lb.fittransformdf.index.values     features  df.values     featurenames  listdf.columns     featurenames.pop0  Remove index.     return features, labels, lb  features, labels, lbencoder  loaddatafilename X, y  features, labels  clflogit  LogisticRegressionpenaltyl1, dualFalse, classweightauto Xreduced  clflogit.fittransformX, y printNew sparse filtered features matrix size printXsvm.shape  Then fit to various models, Random forests, SVM, etc..  codepre  pTruncated Example of the first 2 rows in the input datacsvp  precode            AAC    AAD   AAE   AAF    AAG   AAH    AAI    AAK    AAL    AAM Mammalsequence1.0.fasta   3.838099345 0.456591162 3.764884604 3.620232638 3.460992571 3.858487012 2.69247235  3.18710619  3.671029774 4.625996297 1.542632799 codepre  pAA  Feature name.

Negative 27478 pI am attempting to integrate a Java application with our onpremise Microsoft CRM 2011 using its native webservices.p  pMy offset is the description in a hrefhttpgroovyjavatom.blogspot.dk201201cxfandmscrm2011.html relnofollowthis blog posta and my code does not differ much, but I am now stuck with a codeorg.apache.ws.security.WSSecurityException The signature or decryption was invalidcodep  pI am able to retrieve both TGT and service ticket from Active Directory and gets a Krb5Context created before the webservice is called and CXF fails on the response  which appears to be an error, but as it cannot be decrypted, it is not helpful in diagnosing the problem. The full stacktrace and SOAPresponse is included below.p  pI am using CXF version 2.7.11, although I have also tried a number of other versions to see if that made any difference.p  pMy biggest concern is probably, whether the Kerberos configuration is correct, as it is hard to find good documentation of the requirements for this.p  pMy codep

Negative 27478 pIve seen several questions about how to pull together multiple rows into a single commaseparated column with tsql.

Ive added the codeWITHcode which, as I understand it, creates a sort of temporary table Im sure its actually more complicated than that, but humor me. to hold the values. Obviously, I dont need this just to select the values, but Im going to be joining this with another table later. The whole of what I need to do is still more complicated than what Im trying to do here.p  pSo, Im creating a temporary table named codeusersCSVcode with two columns which Im filling by selecting the codesiteIDcode column from my codeusersSitescode table which is the junction table between codeuserscode and codesitescode and selecting code,   users.emailcode from my codeuserscode table which should give me the email address preceded by a comma and space. Then, I chop the first two characters off that using codeSTUFFcode and group the whole thing by codeusersSites.siteIDcode.p  pThis query gives me an error identifying line 5 as the problem areap  blockquote   pColumn usersSites.userID is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.p blockquote  pWhy should this matter since the column in question is actually in the codeWHEREcode rather than the codeSELECTcode as is stated in the error How can I fix it I need only the users with an ID that matches an ID in the junction table. Ive got tons of users that arent mapped in that table and have no need to select them.p  ptldr I need a temp table with distinct sites in one column and a commaseparated list of the email addresses of related users in the other. These two pieces of data come from other tables and will be put together using a junction table on the primary keys of those two tables. Hope that makes sense.p

When I do funexamplerunid, nothing is returned. p  pWhat am I missing here Is there anyway to use an array with string literals to assign class properties If not, what is a good way to tackle the variable argument issue with constructorsp

Negative 27478 pI have a dropdown menu on a web page that I created using CSS. It drops down sub menus when hovering over items. It works great on my PC, but on a touchscreen I cant get the menu to close when clicking outside the menu. I cant find a way for the touchscreen to recognize that I am not clicking on the menu anymore.p  pSo basically I need a trigger to be fired to tell the menu to close when I touch the screen anywhere outside the menu.p  pI would image that I need some sort of Javascript or JQuery trigger.

Negative 27478 pI am trying to build a django app with two types of users, public users that log in with facebook and enterprise users who log in with emailpassword. I currently am using allauth with a custom user model that lets public users log in with facebook but I am lost as to what approach I should take with creating this new enterprise user type. p  pThere have been suggestions that I should subtype the custom user model such as in a hrefhttpmichalcodes4life.wordpress.com20140208multipleusertypesindjango16 relnofollowhttpmichalcodes4life.wordpress.com20140208multipleusertypesindjango16a however, this example does a poor job of showing how to integrate this with socialauth. How do I tell if the users logged in from the main page, which suggests I should make a public user, versus from the corporate log in, in which case I should make an enterprise user. How do I even specific two different reroutes depending on signuplogin from different starting pagesp  pOther options like creating different UserProfile models seem to defeat the point of me making the custom user model to begin with. Also doesnt having a separate UserProfile model slow down DB searches Also, I would still have to have two separate UserProfile types for public and enterprise users so I would still run into the same problem as with the first option so I might as well just subtype the custom users instead of adding to the mess with UserProfiles. Again, the problem of how to specify different redirects after signup and specify which type of user to create still exists.p  pThe last option seems to be to use the admin system in Django for enterprise accounts. However, wouldnt this mean I would have to make the admin system UI presentable Also, these enterprise accounts should not have access to the ability to edit users fields, so their permissions would be restricted to solely viewing public users on the site.p

Negative 27478 pI had to write a console application that called Microsoft Dynamics CRM web service to perform an action on over eight thousand CRM objects. The details of the web service call are irrelevant and not shown here but I needed a multithreaded client so that I could make calls in parallel. I wanted to be able to control the number of threads used from a config setting and also for the application to cancel the whole operation if the number of service errors reached a configdefined threshold.p  pI wrote it using Task Parallel Library Task.Run and ContinueWith, keeping track of how many calls threads were in progress, how many errors wed received, and whether the user had cancelled from the keyboard. Everything worked fine and I had extensive logging to assure myself that threads were finishing cleanly and that everything was tidy at the end of the run. I could see that the program was using the maximum number of threads in parallel and, if our maximum limit was reached, waiting until a running task completed before starting another one.p  pDuring my code review, my colleague suggested that it would be better to do it with asyncawait instead of tasks and continuations, so I created a branch and rewrote it that way. The results were interesting  the asyncawait version was almost twice as slow, and it never reached the maximum number of allowed parallel operationsthreads. The TPL one always got to 10 threads in parallel whereas the asyncawait version never got beyond 5.p  pMy question is have I made a mistake in the way I have written the asyncawait code or the TPL code even If I have not coded it wrong, can you explain why the asyncawait is less efficient, and does that mean it is better to carry on using TPL for multithreaded code.p  pNote that the code I tested with did not actually call CRM  the CrmClient class simply threadsleeps for a duration specified in the config five seconds and then throws an exception. This meant that there were no external variables that could affect the performance. p  pFor the purposes of this question I created a stripped down program that combines both versions which one is called is determined by a config setting. Each of them starts with a bootstrap runner that sets up the environment, creates the queue class, then uses a TaskCompletionSource to wait for completion. A CancellationTokenSource is used to signal a cancellation from the user. The list of ids to process is read from an embedded file and pushed onto a ConcurrentQueue. They both start off calling StartCrmRequest as many times as maxthreads subsequently, every time a result is processed, the ProcessResult method calls StartCrmRequest again, keeping going until all of our ids are processed. p  pYou can clonedownload the complete program from here a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgkentrobpmgfixsohttpsbitbucket.orgkentrobpmgfixsoap  pHere is the relevant configurationp  precodeltappSettingsgt     ltadd keyTellUserAfterNCalls value5gt     ltadd keyCrmErrorsBeforeQuitting value20gt     ltadd keyMaxThreads value10gt     ltadd keyCallIntervalMsecs value5000gt     ltadd keyUseAsyncAwait valueTrue gt ltappSettingsgt codepre  pStarting with the TPL version, here is the bootstrap runner that kicks off the queue managerp  precodepublic static class TplRunner      private static readonly CancellationTokenSource CancellationTokenSource  new CancellationTokenSource      public static void StartQueueRuntimeParameters parameters, IEnumerableltstringgt idList              Console.CancelKeyPress  s, args gt                      CancelCrmClient             args.Cancel  true                   var start  DateTime.Now         Program.TellUserStart   start          var taskCompletionSource  new TplQueueparameters             .StartCancellationTokenSource.Token, idList          while taskCompletionSource.Task.IsCompleted                      if Console.KeyAvailable                              if Console.ReadKey.Key  ConsoleKey.Q continue                 Console.WriteLineWhen all threads are complete, press any key to continue.

Negative 27478 pI have somehow deeply borked by entire repository used only by me and could use some assistance in sorting it out. p  pHere is what I did. I realized that in my commit history, there were some files containing credentials that I did not want just laying around. So, I decided to be legit and try to use the BFG RepoCleaner to fix these issues. I threw all the credentials in .gitignores, and moved on to trying to scrub them out of the history. As per the documentation instructions, I executed these commandsp  precodegit clone mirror myrepo.git java jar bfg.jar deletefiles stuffthatshouldbedeleted.txt  myrepo.git codepre  pAt this point, BFG told me that x number of files had been found and removed. Sweet.p  precodecd myrepo.git git reflog expire expirenow all git gc prunenow aggressive git push codepre  pAccording to the terminal logs, it updated the repo. So far so good, right I pop into my github account, and after a few clicks, find the credentials still there, file and all, in my history. I go back and try the same set of commands, but using this line instead of the file removerp  precodejava jar bfg.jar replacetext passwords.txt  myrepo.git codepre  pwhere passwords.txt is a file containing string instances of all the credentials I would like gone. Again, BFG logs indicate that there are several instances that it has fixed. I push up, check, and the credentials are still there, sitting in Github. I notice that the SHA1 keys for all of my commits have been altered, so presumably BFG did something, just not the thing I want it to do.p  pAt this point, I give up and try to get back to work, figure Ill sort it out later. I do some work, try to push up, get a weird merge conflict you are 50 ahead and 50 behind on commits. What I try to pull and merge, and suddenly, every single commit in my git history is duplicated in name, and some of them are just blank. I check my Github network graph, and it looks like there is a second branch starting from my initial commit that exactly mirrors all of my commits that has been zippered in with my last commit I have never branched, just been linearly chugging along.p  pI cant revert to a previous commit, because they are all chronologically duplicated. My credentials are still in there, with twice as many instances now, and my history is doubled and very confusing to try to understand. When I try to run BFG from the beginning now, cloning and mirroring the repo anew, it tells me that there are no credentials in it, despite the fact that I can see them in Github. I could really use some help in understanding what happened, and how, if at all, I can get back to a state of things again.p  pI am considering just deleting the entire repo and starting anew. I really dont want to do that.p  ptldr Tried using BFG, somehow duplicated halfbaked versions of all commits in my repo, cant untangle, and to add insult to injury, BFG did nothing and claims its done its job. p

Negative 27478 pThis question is can be viewed continuationextensiongeneralization of a previous question of mine from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25383795efficientsearchforpermutationsthatcontainsubpermutationsviaarrayoperatherea.p  pstrongSome definitionsstrong I have a set of integers codeS  1,2,...,scode, say codes  20code, and two matrices codeNcode and codeMcode whose rows are finite sequences of numbers from codeScode i.e. permutations with possible repetitions, of order codencode and codemcode respectively, where code1 lt n lt mcode. Let us think of codeNcode as a collection of candidate subsequences for the sequences from codeMcode. p  pExample code[2 3 4 3]code is a subsequence of code[1 2 2 3 5 4 1 3]code that occurs with emmultiplicityem 2 in how many different ways one can find the subseq. in the main seq., whereas code[3 2 2 3]code is not a subsequence of it. In particular, a valid subsequence by definition must preserve the order of the indices.p  pstrongProblem statementstrongp  pstrongP1strong For each row of codeMcode, obtain the number of subsequences of it, with multiplicity and without multiplicity, that occur in codeNcode as rows it can be zero if none are contained in codeNcodep  pstrongP2strong For each row of codeNcode, find out how many times, with multiplicity and without multiplicity, it is contained in codeMcode as a subsequence again, this number can be zerop  pstrongExamplestrong Let codeN  [1 2 2 2 3 4]code and codeM  [1 1 2 2 3 1 2 2 3 4 1 2 3 5 6]code. Then strongP1strong returns code[2 3 0]code for with multiplicities and code[1 2 0]code for without multiplicities. strongP2strong returns code[3 2]code for with multiplicities and code[2 1]code without multiplicities.p  pstrongOrder of magnitudestrong codeMcode could typically have up to 3040 columns and a few thousand rows, although I currently have codeMcode with only a few hundred rows and 10 columns. codeNcode could be approaching the size of  codeMcode or could be also much smaller.p  pstrongWhat I have so farstrong Not much, to be honest. I believe I might be able to slightly modify my notverywellvectorized solution from my previous question to tackle permutations with repetitions, but I am still thinking on that and will update as soon as I have something working. But given my lack of experience so far, it would be in all likelihood very suboptimal p  pThanksp

Negative 27478 pI was trying to attach an elapsed time to every post of my comments that are displayed on my gridview control. This is a part of my comment section page that Im working right now.p  pSo I came up with using ajax timer control and I coded and test my TimerTick event handler in a dummy page to create a running clock so I can get the values of the elapsed time like strongjust a few seconds ago, 8 minutes ago, 2 hrs ago, Yesterday at 1000 A.M.strong and so on. I guess you figure out now what I mean just like posting at Facebook you will see the time elapsed from each post. I only use one timer control when I was testing on the dummy page and was working fine I was able to get those time elapsed values and the clock is running fine. Now, when I embedded the timer control in my gridview where all my comments resides the problem I encounter is its only the top row will have the time elapsed value displayed but the previous rows are empty. So everytime you enter a new comment its only the last comment will display the elapsed time running and the rest are empty. Any suggestions on how to do this properly...

Negative 27478 pI have a short program with which I am going to test the infinite recursion. However, I meet another tough question associated to function pointer...p  pthe program is as followp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int repeatchar funcint, int, int a    funca, a1   return repeatfunc, a1   char f int a , int b   printfdn, a   return doublea  b   return c   int mainint argc, char const argv[]    repeatampf, 1   return 0  codepre  pAs for me, I think the f in strongrepeatampf, 1strong has the type of strongchar strong and the func in strongint repeatchar funcint, int, int astrong has the type of strongchar strong,too.p  pHowever, it seems strange. If I change strongchar funcint, int, int astrong  to  strongchar funcint, int, int astrong , the compilertesting in gcc and vc6 do not give any warnings and the running result is the same.p  pIf I change  strongchar funcint, int, int astrong  to strongdouble funcint, int, int astrong ,  the compiler throws  p  pemwarning incompatible pointer types passing char emint, int to parameter of type double emint, int [Wincompatiblepointertypes] repeatampf, 1emp  pIt seems that the compiler treat strongdouble int, intstrong and strongdouble int, intstrong the same stuff. In other words, If I change strongchar funcint, int, int astrong to strongdouble funcint, intstrong, the compiler will throw the same message I have tested itp  pemwarning incompatible pointer types passing char emint, int to parameter of type double emint, int [Wincompatiblepointertypes] repeatampf, 1emp  pGod... Well, it is not the end. After that, I change the strongrepeatampf, 1strong strongto repeatf, 1strong with other parts unchanged. That is, the whole program isp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int repeatchar funcint, int, int a    funca, a1   return repeatfunc, a1   char f int a , int b   printfdn, a   return doublea  b   return c   int mainint argc, char const argv[]    repeatf, 1   return 0  codepre  pthe compiler do not give any warnings and the running results are the same.p  pSo I am confused that all of the following paris yields no warnings and correct results.p  precode    1   repeatampf, 1   int repeatchar funcint, int, int a     2   repeatampf, 1   int repeatchar funcint, int, int a      3   repeatf, 1    int repeatchar funcint, int, int a      4   repeatf, 1    int repeatchar funcint, int, int a  codepre  pOf course the f in strongrepeatf, 1strong has the type of strongchar int, intstrong, and the func in strongint repeatdouble emfuncint, int, int astrong has the type of strongchar emint, intstrong. p  pYou can infer this by changing strongint repeatchar funcint, int, int astrong  to strongint repeatdouble funcint, int, int astrong  and check the warning messagep  pemwarning incompatible pointer types passing char int, int to parameter of type double emint, int [Wincompatiblepointertypes] repeatf, 1p  pWho can give some comments I totally think that only the first of the four is correct regarding the type. p

Negative 27478 pI have a SQL Server CE 3.5 database application that I am working on and I have used a DataSetTableAdapterQuery to retrieve records from a table. When I created the Query that uses the Primary Key of the table and int column it works just fine with a parameter. The SQL for that is codeSELECT ID,Name,Birthdate FROM People WHERE IDIDcode. This generates a method on the Table Adapter with a single int parameter and it works great. Now, I have a unique index set on the Name field and I want to have a similar method on the TableAdapter called GetByName that retrieves the record by the Name field in a similar way codeSELECT ID,Name,Birthdate FROM People WHERE NameNamecode so I attempt to create this Query on the TableAdapter and the first issue I run into is an error thats generated when I attempt to create the Query with this SQL. It tells me that No mapping exists from DbType Object to SQL Server Compact data type. So I changed the DbType in the parameters properties from Object to String. Now when I call the method I get no data back. I have tried passing just the straight string value likecode string sName  Bob myAdapter.GetByNamesNamecode. p  pI have tried passing in the value with single quotes code string sName  Bob myAdapter.GetByNamesNamecode. p  pNo data is returned in either case. No error is thrown but no data is returned.p  pI tried modifying the SQL in the Query to code SELECT ID,Name,Birthdate FROM People WHERE NameName code Still no data.p  pI tried wrapping all of the field names in square brackets and fully qualifying the Name column in the WHERE clause code SELECT [ID],[Name],[Birthdate] FROM [People] WHERE [People].[Name]Name code Still no data.p  pNot sure how to make this work. Im sure it has to be able to be done but for the life of me I cannot figure out how.p

Negative 27478 pI am facing a serious issue using GCM. Earlier we used to send push notification using UrbanAirship which sends push messages using GCM. Now we have implemented our own GCM on Client and Server and want to send push notifications using only GCM. Since some of the users will be using the old version of the application and might not have updated to new one, we have to keep using UrbanAirship to send notifications to them. The users who have updated the app will get the push messages through gcm ONLY. This was tested on debug mode and worked fine.When push messages were sent through UrbanAirship, it was not received by those devices in which new build was installed.p  pBut on live server, when we tried to send push message the users who had updated the app and were with us since inception, who used to receive push messages through UrbanAirship received push messages from GCM as well as UrbanAirship. The push message sent via GCM contained the message but the message sent via UrbanAirship was blank. The same thing did not happen on those devices which installed the app for the first time. Those users received push message only via GCM.p  pI believe the reason for this is that UrbanAirship still had the deviceids for those devices which used to receive push messages via UrbanAirship. Now, the permission used by activities handling the broadcast for GCM and UrbanAirship is same, they both respond to same action in the intentfilter. Thus, even though the activity for UrbanAirship was removed from the manifest file, the message was handled by the activity which handles GCM Push message. p  pIs there a way to prevent UrbanAirship from sending push messages to those devices which usedd to receive Notifications via UrbanAirship or unregister those devices from UrbanAirship Or can I modify the receiver for GCM by passing an extra parameter which if not recognized in the app, wont create push notificationp

Negative 27478 pI have a file structure like the followingp  precode binaries     binary1.dll  dev     ltdevelopernamegt        a.csproj trunk      a.csproj codepre  pDevelopers who need to work on a.csproj will create a branch in dev and they will work from there. Our projects need to have a reference to binary1.dll in the binaries directory.p  pIf the reference is a relative path the Visual Studio default then the path will not work both for the project in trunk and the project in the developers branch.p  pTo work around this problem I thought of creating an environment variable and using that in the project file insteadp  precodeltReference Includebinary1gt    ltHintPathgtMYENVVARbinary1.dllltHintPathgt ltReferencegt codepre  pThis works perfectly, but I wanted to help developers add references more easily, so I wrote a program that will convert relative paths that point to binary1.dll for example, from the dev branch a.csproj it would change the path code....binariesbinary1.dllcode to codeMYENVVARbinary1.dllcode but I have not figured out how to get that to work.p  pIf I use a prebuild event, the project is already loaded into memory and the event return an error because it cannot write the project file. p  pThen I realized that I could override MSBuild targets, and attempted with the targets codeBeforeCompilercode, codeAfterCompilercode, codeBeforeBuildcode, codeAfterBuildcode and in all of them the project is already locked. p  pThen I ran into a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17726525modifycsprojinprebuildeventthis answera and I modified my code to call the executable in the codeGenerateApplicationManifestcode target, but that one doesnt seem to call the executable at all.p  pSome other ideas that I have been playing with are creating a new project that does the updating of the second project and have a link between them, but that would duplicate the number of projects.p  pI could also just change the depth of trunk, but that only hides the problem and doesnt really solve it. When developers create a branch inside their dev branch to work on different features or bugs then I have the same problem all over again.p  pThere might also be another feature which fixes this in a more elegant way, but I havent been able to find anything.p  pSo my question How do I get MS Build or prebuild events to modify a CS projectp

Negative 27478 pIve got this script written which does some involved parsing while running through a large file. For every line in the file after some heavy manipulation, I need to add a check to see whether it meets certain criteria and if it does, include it in a list for additional processing later.p  pThe function doing the parsing is already a bit cluttered, and Im wondering whether its possible to shunt the linechecking and list manipulation to another function to make things easier to modify later on. My inclination is to use a global variable which gets modified by the function, but I know thats usually poor form. Until now I have never made use of classes, but I vaguely recall there being some advantage to them regarding persistent local variables.p  pOne version of this part of the script could bep  precodematchingLines  [] def lineProcessline     global matchingLines     if line.startswithcriteria         matchingLines.appendline for line in myFile      lots of other stuff     lineProcessline codepre  pObviously in this simple example its not much of a pain to just do the checking in the main function and not bother with any additional functions. But in principle, Im wondering what a better general way of doing this sort of thing is without using external variables.p  pEDIT Part of the reason I find the separate function attractive is because once Ive collected the list of lines, I am going to use them to manipulate another external file and it would be convenient to have the whole operate wrapped up in a contained module. However, I recognize that this might be premature optimization.p

Negative 27478 pIm using ASP.NET MVC to separate my HTML views from my Models. However theres a specific situation that is confusing me slightly.p  pI have several commonly used small panels of information, which themselves are comprised of a number of smaller panels of information. these get their data from a subclass contained within the various models, sometimes single instances, sometimes lists of objects.p  pAt present this is done using Partial views, passing the appropriate piece of data via the model parameter, as suchp  precodeHtml.PartialUserInfo, this.Model.CurrentUser Html.PartialUserInfo, reply.PostedBy codepre  pAnd so on. This all works fine.p  pIve recently hit a requirement which feels like it stretches sensible limits for this model however  it will involve a very large number of partial views with a TINY amount of HTML in each, nested numerous times. The page resolution time seems to be starting to get a little out of hand, and I suspect the amount of searching for and reflecting partial views might have something to do with it.p  pemPlease noteem Im assuming duplicating HTML which is supposed to be the same is still to be avoided. I could simplify the nest by having copies of HTML in some of the higher level controls, but it strikes me this damages maintainability.p  pFor the inner most ones it would seem to make more sense to me to create static helper classes which generate and return the required HTML  however, despite the fact MVC itself does it with the codeHtmlcode helper class, it feels like this goes against the MVC pattern.p  ul listrongIs it OK to use static helper classes to generate small HTML snippetsstrongli liWhere should the static codeUserInfocode class go Views Controllers Elsewhereli ul  pObviously this approach still separates the helper method from the model, but as it takes a model in to work with, I dont really see how uncoupled it really is.p  pA static helper is a hairs breadth away from an extension method, consumable in a codeuserInstance.InfoHtmlcode type of way, which just seems to make the whole approach really similar to just adding the helper method to the model. This is of course what MVC is trying to get away from in the first placep  pemPlease noteem Im not trying to sneak around the rules or complain I just want to approach this as on pattern as possible. If lots and lots of partial views is the way, Ill stick with that and performance tune as best I can.p

Negative 27478 pI am creating an internet spider, I have the needed code to download webpages, add links to the found and to be spidered pool. I am facing two problems. The first is that it is supposed to start a number of threads, specified with the tn flag, the default is 5. However, the program will only start one. The other problem i am facing is that the spider isnt parsing the html correctly. I am using the jsoup parsing library. I have configured it to find links, and to find media. However it will only detect the images. How can i fix that.

Negative 27478 pI am the current sole developer of a content management system used by Toastmasters public speaking clubs worldwide to produce free websites for those clubs.  This is an independent effort using open source librariestools and volunteer laborI am not a professional developer and I work on this in my spare time.  When I took over the development of the system, it was a mess multiple code versions in individual files, no file versions, terrible code organization, and no development tools to speak of.  I have improved on that somewhat, but I want to take it to the next level to allow for bringing in other developers.  The code is Perl, MySQL, and JavaScript w jQuery, jQuery UI.  I considered putting the code on GitHub, but I want to get it better organized before I release it to public scrutiny.  I have remote server access via PuTTY and FTP for uploading code updates.  I have installed git, node.js, grunt, bower, and less on the server Amazon Web Services, along with a number of the grunt pluginsI have zero experience with any of these.  What I want is to maintain 3 parallel versions of the code production, production duplicate for bug fix testing, and development code.  I will also be implementing language translation support which I will need versioning for, also.p  pFrankly, I am at a bit of a loss about where to start.  I am not sure if I should work on organization of the git code repository or if I should focus on getting grunt going for me first.  Any insights or recommendations are greatly appreciated.p

Negative 27478 pThis is more of a conceptual confusion. I am making a multicast server which just echoes back the datagram received.Heres the codep  precode    while 1           cnt  recvfromsock, message, sizeofmessage, 0,                  struct sockaddr  ampaddr, ampaddrlen          printfd n,cnt          if cnt lt 0              perrorrecvfrom             exit1           else if cnt  0              break                    printfs message  sn, inetntoaaddr.sinaddr, message          addr.sinaddr.saddr  inetaddrEXAMPLEGROUP          cnt  sendtosock, message, sizeofmessage, 0,           struct sockaddr  ampaddr, addrlen          if cnt lt 0              perrorsendto             exit1                 codepre  pThe problem with this is as a multicast server will also receive the datagram. So, after it recieves a datagram, it sends, it again recieves the same datagram, and so on entering an infinite loop. Any pointers on how to implement such type of serverp

Negative 27478 pIm having significant issues getting Winforms C autoscaling working correctly.p  pFirst of all, it doesnt seem to even do anything across DPIs. When I create a simple application, all of the controls appear the same size on 100 and 125 DPI, however the fonts in all of my controls have been scaled up in 125 DPI. I would expect that the Form would be scaled up to allow for the larger fonts, but this is not the case. This may be due to the fact the application is not DPIAware, and so it uses XP Style font scaling instead, but Im not really sure. Heres how it looksp  pemApplication at 100 DPI, Not Localizedemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxTk0U.png altApplication at 100 DPI, Not Localizedp  pemApplication at 125 DPI, Not Localizedemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMkhza.png altApplication at 125 DPI, Not Localizedp  pThe issues above are frustrating, but not deal breaking.

Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a      type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support      textvalue conversion through the TypeConverter architecture.      Classes that dont support this are serialized and stored with the      mimetype set.      The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the      ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not      extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly      Note  applicationxmicrosoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format      that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can      read any of the formats listed below.      mimetype applicationxmicrosoft.net.object.binary.base64     value    The object must be serialized with

must be serialized with               System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter              and then encoded with base64 encoding.      mimetype

The other implementation that i saw was by adding  to a first Html.DropDownListFor an onchange javascript function that created more dropdownlists by calling an ajax function which returned the the options to add to the new drop down list, these new drop down lists were created using the html lt select  tag, to which another onchange javascript function was bound to keep cascading more of these.

Negative 27478 pIn my MVC Application I have my routes defined as followsp  precode        routes.MapRoute             Categorydefault,             langCategorycategoryidcontrolleractionid,             new  lang  en, action  Index, id  UrlParameter.Optional, categoryid  1          .DataTokens.Addarea, Category          routes.MapRoute             name Default,             url langcontrolleractionid,             defaults new  controller  home, action  index, lang  en, id  UrlParameter.Optional           codepre  pThe application works fine. However, the system administrator just brought to my knowledge that those users who dont have access to the category in other words, they are logically not associated with it can also see the data just by switching the categoryid parameter, which is no surprise since I havent put any check there.p  pWhats the efficient way of checking if the user has privileges over this category or not. In the system I have a User object with User.AllowedCategories List which contains integer values of all the ids the user has access to.p  pThe category area has about 20 controllers therefore 20 views. Should I put a logic to check on every view Or I can do it with minimum coding  or can I put this logic globallyp

Negative 27478 pI am working on a web site project which requires that the web page display tooltips on hover. For reasons I wont go into here, I decided to use a library from a site called a hrefhttpwww.dynweb.comcodetooltipsdocumentation.php relnofollowdynweb.coma.  The a hrefhttpwww.dynweb.comcodetooltipsdocumentation.php relnofollowlibrarya works great but I need to make one small change to the way it works, which will make it a perfect fit for my application.  Trouble is, I cant figure out how it worksp  pEverything Ive read says that you cant execute javascript code from within CSS.  But that seems to be exactly what this library does.  To create a tooltip for any element anchor, div, span, etc, all this library requires you to do isp  ol liInclude a ltscript src gt tag to the library fileli liAdd two class names to the HTML element that will host the tooltip, one called showTip and the other is a key into a JSON object containing the tooltip textli liAdd the tooltip text to the JSON object mentioned aboveli liCreate a style to format the tooltip how you want it to lookli ol  pIf youll notice, nowhere in these steps is mention of any event handlers. Moreover, theres no class that I can find called emshowTipem. Theres no JQuery or other dependencies. So how does the javascript get executedp  pI dont want to jump in and start changing the library willynilly without knowing how it works, and Ive been pulling out my hair trying to figure it out.

Negative 27478 pSo the problem Im having is that the HttpClient keeps throwing an exception before it even attempts the request. I think I was able to narrow it down to the authorization header.

If I remove that header, then the request will go through and Ill get a 401 response as expected without the token. If I changed the value of codetokencode to ABC then the request will go through but return an error from the server Im talking to, as expected.p  pIve also tried adding the Authorization header by using codeclient.DefaultRequestHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidationAuthorization, tokencode and I end up with the same result Invalid HTTP headers.p  pHere is the content of the token without the Bearer scheme at the front a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comv5mJ6.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comv5mJ6.png altenter image description hereap  pHeres the thing.

It seems that system properties dont correspond to  the environment variables.p  pThe situation is that I would like to the change the absolute location of the userspecific codesettings.xmlcode file, as the Maven document saysp  blockquote   pIf you need to create userspecific settings from scratch, its   easiest to copy the global settings from your Maven installation to   your user.home.m2 directoryp blockquote  pwhich means that the only way to change the absolute location of the userspecific file is to change the codeuser.homecode property. But it seems that this is not exactly the codeHOMEcode or codeHOMEPATHcode environment variable. In fact, I deleted all the environment variables such as codeHOMEcode and codeHOMEPATHcode, and run mvn using codemvn Xcode just to see the userspecific codesettings.xmlcode that mvn uses.

By the way, there is no settings.xml file in this path, because I havent put any file in this path.p  pHow maven figure out such a path as codeuser.homecodep

Negative 27478 pI have written a simple binary tree using structures and a couple of functions in order to add, search, find the minimum and maximum values, remove a node as well as destroy the node, the problem is that I have been using recursion and dealing with it in the same way and I am having a hard time trying to comprehend if my function for sorting the algorithm is efficient enough.p  pThe whole code isp  precodeincludeltiostreamgt using namespace std     This is a very simple example demonstrating a very basic binary tree to be    implemented using structurs, later on I would like to create this by using   classes, but for now, structures and pointers would suffice       The node is created in here, notice how the pointer has the ability to    self reference to 2 different positions, this means that there is the ability   to store to 2 different branches of memory      struct node   int keyvalue   node  pleft   node  pright        This is the creation of the add function that will add to the linked list      node addnode  ptree, int key    The base case of the recursive function will be placed in here   since binary trees are recursive in nature and linked data structures   are as a whole in terms of space and memory, the recursive function will   suffice for most cases involving binary trees.   In this case, if the given parameter is null, we create the tree   by allocating the necessary memory space   if ptree  NULL      node  pnewtree  new node     pnewtreegtpleft  NULL     pnewtreegtpright  NULL     pnewtreegtkeyvalue  key     return pnewtree    end of base case    Depending of the value of the node, we determine if we will add to the left side or the right side of the subtree   if key lt ptreegtkeyvalue      if it is less than the value, we add to the left     ptreegtpleft  insertptreegtpleft, key      else     ptreegtpright  insertptreegtpright, key      return ptree   end of function          This is where the search function will be created   in here the function will go over all the subtrees untill the one with the necessary key is returned   again, this uses recursive functions doing things step by step      First Look to see if the given tree node is emptyNULL if yes then return NULL      Second If we find the key by referencing the key value, then we are done and return that particular tree     Third Otherwise, look into the left and right sides of the tree making recursive calls to this very same function until          the one that we are looking for is found.        node searchnode ptree, key    First   if ptree  NULL  return NULL     Second   else if ptreegtkeyvalue  key  return ptree     Third   else ifkey lt ptreegtkeyvalue      searchptreegtpleft, key Thus it looks into the left with the same recursive algorithm      else      searchptreegtpright, key    End of recursive search function       Easiest function to implement, since the delete key is used being that the whole concept falls inside memory being allocated to the   list via the creation of new nodesthis means using the new keyword to allocate memory, much like creating new objects in other languages     First Check to see if passed tree is not null, if not null destroy the left and right subtree using the same function          else nothing.      NOTE The return value is set to void since it returns nothing back to the list     void destroynodenode ptree    First   if ptree  NULL      destroyptreegtpleft     destroyptreegtpright     cout ltlt endl     cout ltlt Destroying left subtree node ltlt endl     cout ltlt Destroying right subtree node ltlt endl     cout ltlt Deleting the entire node  ltlt ptreegtkeyvalue ltlt endl     cout ltlt endl     delete ptree    End of recursive destroy function         Finding the max value is simple, we evaluate the left and right node and use base cases to see which node to return   Why just right   looking back at the theory behind binary trees, the tree on the right is always the biggest element. That is how trees are normally sorted.   there is no need to look at the keys, the code will sort out by itself in this space since if it is not null it will return the highest.   node returnmaxnode ptree    if ptree  NULL      return NULL      if ptreegtpright  NULL      return ptree      return returnmaxptreegtpright  End of return max recursive function        Max node, basically the opposite of the avobe taking advantage of the fact that the left node is lesser   recursion will be used again      node returnminnode ptree   if ptree  NULL      return NULL      ifptreegtpleft  NULL      return ptree      return returnminptreegtpleft End of recursive return min function       We need a remove max function in order to properly remove the biggest node in case it is found, that way we can implement a recursive   algorithm inside the  function in charge of removing the node we want, we can simply remove the node by using delete or destroy once we   find it because that would only destroy the entire tree No no, that is not good.     node removemaxnodenode ptree, node pmaxnode    if ptree  NULL  return NULL    if ptree  pmaxnode      return pmaxnodegtpleft Because the left one is lesser      Now for the recursive call, implementing this means that we will remove from the node on the right   basing us on the sense that the right tree is the highest one, it will go then from top to bottom   ptreegtpright  removemaxnodeptreegtpright, pmaxnode   return the tree after the changes in the addresses have been conducted properly   return ptree                   Removing from a tree is also simple based on the recursive nature of the element being discussed     First Check to see if the tree is null, if yess, return null     node removeNnode ptree, int key    First   if ptree  NULL  return NULL   Second   ifptreegtkeyvalue  key      Third     if ptreegtpleft  NULL        node prightsub  ptreegtpright       delete ptree       return prightsub          if ptreegtpright  NULL        node pleftsub  ptreegtpleft       delete ptree       return pleftsub           node pmaxN  returnmaxptreegtpleft     pmaxNgtpleft  removemaxnodeptreegtpleft, pmaxnode     pmaxNgtpright  ptreegtpright     delete ptee     return pmaxnode      else ifkey lt ptreegtkeyvalue      ptreegtpleft  removeNptreegtpleft, key      else      ptreegtpright  removeNptreegtpright, key      After all  changes have been done   return ptree        The entire implementation is sorted when calling return min and max         node sortedNnode ptree   if ptree  NULLreturn NULL    return sortedNreturnmaxptree        int mainint argv, char []    cout ltlt This is merely a test ltlt endl   return 0  codepre  pMy understanding is that the way I defined the other functions originally already sort and return the state of the node itself in a new way being that I am using pointers. Maybe I am wrong to think that my sorting function works. I have been with this all day and cannot think of a better way, most of my code was written for the understanding I have in it and the help of my books, my instructor is not being much help as well so I came here seeking some wisdom.p

One area in particular I think is a major headache as far as memory leaks are concerned are events, and therefore I believe this solution should address this nicely.p  pThe way I think about it is that this should allow 1 and only one subscriber to subscribe to events at a time. Meaning that the same object shouldnt be able to subscribe for the same event twice and having the subsequent side effects.p  pSecond, since I keep a reference to the subscribers of the event  when dispose comes around I can get rid of those references, regardless of the fact that the EventHandler internally keeps the same references. I get a chance to unhook the event completely by unhooking all of its subscribers and thus preventing the pesky memory leaks.p  pDoes anyone think this will introduce issues in the app I mean its rather large and I dont want to push experimental stuff without researching a bit more.p  pThanksp  pStart with the codeDisposableObjectcode base classp  precodepublic class DisposableObject  IDisposable    private bool disposed  false  to detect redundant calls     ltsummarygt    Default constructor    ltsummarygt   public DisposableObject       ltsummarygt    Object that inherit from this base class should override this method instead,    since its called from the Dispose method by the base.    ltsummarygt    ltparam namedisposinggtltparamgt   protected virtual void Disposebool disposing        if disposed            if disposing                 disposeonly, i.e. nonfinalizable logic                shared cleanup logic       disposed  true             ltsummarygt    Destructor    ltsummarygt   DisposableObject        Disposefalse        ltsummarygt    Implementation of IDisposable.
