Positive 1995 pI am working on hadoop. I was looking for hadoop installation on Windows though everywhere it is mentioned to be installed on linuxunix system. While configuring hadoop on windows, the problem I am facing is Java home path. As there is only jre installed on my machine, I mentioned the same path in environment variable and in hadoopenv.cmd file. When I am trying to use any hadoop command it is giving me error saying Java home not correctly specified. Here is my Java home path CProgram FilesJavajre7bin There is not jdk installed in there.p  pPlease help me installing hadoop with the same configuration I have.p  pNote As the machines are provided by my organisation, I dont have rights to installed java related software. By default we have that jre installed in our machines by our administrator.p

Positive 1995 pI am working on a master thesis project which aims at integrating a custom Map Reduce framework with similar MR interface but own implementation and pipeline, with higher level language frameworks as PIG. p  pCurrently, the MR master and workers have been integrated with YARN so that such jobs can be launched on YARN. The framework is written in C and its running OpenCL defined Map and Reduce functions.p  pThe aim is to make the proprietary MR framework available for usage in as many scenarios as possible, maintaining its own pipeline, with minimum changes to the applications or frameworks which employ Hadoop Map Reduce.p  pGiven the large landscape of Hadoop projects I would need some pointers to resources, literature or documentation of how this has been achieved Pig can run on top of Hadoop MR and Spark at least or which options can be considered. I am conducting reading already into YARN, Pig and so on but some pointers would be really helpfulp

Positive 1995 pI am running a mapreduce job using Table MapReduce Util which takes the hbase table data1 million rows as input,In mapper I am evaluating a particular set of expressions for every row input from hbase table and it was getting completed less time as long as expressions to be evaluated for a particular row were around 10 to 20.p  pBut as the number of expressions have increased to 100to be calculated for every row in hbase table my mapreduce job is taking so much time so i thought of using the same jobsame mapreduce jar in parallel for 10 times with 10 expressions each so that if all the jobs run in parallel i can achieve the output faster. I tried to launch 10 jobs in parallel using a shell script but initially 2 jobs are getting completed in parallel and then only its launching other two jobs and so on...As far as my understanding this jar file is able to launch only 2 parallel jobs at a time and its only allowing the other jobs to access it only when the current running jobs gets completed. p  pso is there any other way to launch all the jobs in parallel using the same map reduce jar file...p

Positive 1995 pI have a Hadoop cluster with 3 machines, 1 NameNode and 2 DataNodes.

But I noticed  a huge amount of codeeditlogcode files. Furthermore, the codefsimagecode was stuck at the transaction code00000code. At this point I suspected that no checkpointing was made which was confirmed by entries in the logs. Then I checked the codeVERSIONcode in both NN and DNs. Although the clusterID was the same in all 3 machines, I realized that the the codelayoutVersioncode was different in NameNode 57 and DataNodes 55.

Positive 1995 pIm using libhdfs to write large binary files. It works fine but for one problem. Even though I specify a 256K buffer size in the hdfsOpen call and call hdfsRead with a 256k data buffer, HDFS will read or write only 128k at a time.p  pCan that limit be changed anywhere Can I readwrite more than 128k at a timep  pstrongEditstrong Never mind. I misread the hdfsOpen API. The fourth argument is the maximum size of the buffer you will readwrite. That is different from the last argument which sets the block size. I had the buffer size set to zero which gave me the default value of 128K.p  pFor examplep  pfd  hdfsOpenFilehdfs, path, OWRONLYOCREATOTRUNC, 1048576, 0, 1048576p  pI specified 1048576 for the buffer size and 1048576 for the block size. This lets me write a page of data that will fit into a single block.p

Positive 1995 pI want to understand that how does saveAstestFile work. The background for this is we have a Spark cluster which has been created on Cassandra setup. Eventually we are required to connect from Spark and store the data in another clusterHDFS.p  pSo since the access for the Hadoop cluster is in concern, we had questions on will the Master in Spark if it has access to Hadoop gateway, will that be sufficient. Or do we need all the Worker Nodes also be access Hadoop gateway access.p

Positive 1995 pI have a cronjob that that downloads zip files 200 bytes to 1MB from a server on the internet every 5 minutes.  If I import the zip files into HDFS as is, I encounter the infamous Hadoop small file size issue.  In order to avoid the build up of small files in HDFS, process of the the text data in the zip files and convert them into avro files and wait every 6 hours to add my avro file into HDFS.  Using this method, I have managed to get avro files imported into HDFS with a file size larger than 64MB.  The files sizes range from 50MB to 400MB.  What Im concerned about is that what happens if I start building file sizes that start getting into the 500KB avro file size range or larger.  Will this cause issues with Hadoop  How does everyone else handle this situationp
Positive 1995 pIm running a Hadoop cluster with 6 nodes, but in the Hadoop MapReduce Administration page, I see 30 nodes listed.  When I select that number and see the Hadoop Machine List page, I see that all but 6 of those nodes have a Seconds since heartbeat greater than 0, which means that 24 nodes are outdated.p  pThus, it seems that dead nodes with heartbeats0 are showing up with the live nodesp  pIm running mesos on hadoop, and I wonder if that is the reason for the dead nodes appearing.

Negative 1995 pOK, having tried my first TDD attempt, its time to reflect a little and get some guidance, because it wasnt that successful for me. The solution was partly being made with an existing framework, perhaps making TDD less ideal. The part that seemed to give me the biggest problem, was the interaction between the view and controller. Ill give a few simple examples and hope that someone will tell me what I can do better wrong.p  pEach views interface inherits from a base interface, with these members there are morep  ppublic interface IViewbr  br  void ShowFieldstring fieldIdbr  void HideFieldstring fieldIdbr  void SetFieldVisibilitystring fieldId, bool visiblebr  void DisableFieldstring fieldIdbr  void ShowValidationErrorstring fieldIdbr  ...br    p  pThe interface for a concrete view, would then add members for each field like this public interface IMyView  IViewbr  br  string Name  get set br  string NameFieldID  get br  ...br    p  pWhat do you think of this Is inheriting from a common interface a good or bad idea One on the things that gave me trouble was, that first I used ShowField and HideField and the found out I would rather use SetFieldVisiblity. I didnt change the outcome of the method, but I had to update my test, which I seem should be necessary. Is having multiple methods doing the same thing, a bad thing On one hand both methods are handy for different cases, but they do clutter the interface, making the interface more complex than it strictly have to be.p  pWould a design without a common interface be better That would remove the fieldID, I dont why, but I think the fieldIDthing smells, I might be wrong. I would only make the Show and Hide methods, when needed, that is if they would be called by the controller. This would be a less generic solution and require more code in the view, but the controller code would be a bit more simple.p  pSo a view interface might look like this public interface IMyViewbr  br  void ShowNamebr  void HideNamebr  string Name  get set br  int Age  get set br    p

Negative 1995 pIm a former classic ASP programmer and sometimes PHP programmer writing my first ASP.NET application. Im loving the muchimproved ADO.NET functions, but Im feeling the need to write a database class. Partly I want to consolidate the code that actually interacts with the database, and partly I want to reduce what feels like repetition.p  pA simple database class is not hard to do, but Im using parameterized queries as one of my security measures. Im struggling with how to incorporate this into a class. I wrote a function to return the datatype of a column in the database by passing in the table and column name, but I cant think of a robust way to obtain the table and column name from the SQL query.p  pMy design for the class was to have a Query function for selecting, and an Execute function for insertupdatedelete. Not opposed to having more public functions, but didnt want to get ahead of myself. Both functions take a SQL string and a SortedList for the parameters. It might be possible to get the column name by finding the parameter name in the SQL string and looking in front of the equal sign. Likewise, it should be fairly simple to get the table name when the query is insert, update, or delete, because you only work with one table at a time. The big concern is selecting, because there could be one or more joins, inner selects, etc.p  pAm I headed in the wrong direction Anything Im not thinking of that could make my life easier or more difficult Anybody written a class for this in any language that could offer some advicep

Negative 1995 pI developed an application that uses Apache XML security library for xml encryption and signing. It runs on SUNs JDK without any problems, however, IBM JDK gives me tons of problems. p  pIt doesnt sign right validation fails, pkcs11 provider fails to encrypt.p  pIt seems that problem is because IBM provides their own security providers.

Negative 1995 pIm writing a game that displays 56 hexagon pieces filling the screen in the shape of a board. Im currently drawing each piece using a singleton rendering class that when called to draw a piece, creates a path from 6 points based of the coordinate passed in. This path is filled with a solid color and then a 59x59 png with an alpha to white gradient is overlayed over the drawing to give the piece a shiny look. Note Im currently doing this in Core Graphics.p  pMy first thought is that creating a path everytime I draw is costly and seems like I can somehow do this once and then reuse it, but Im not sure of the best approach for this. When I look at the bottlenecks with Shark, it looks like the drawing of the png is the most taxing part of the process. Ive tried just rendering the png overlay or just rendering the path without the overlay and both give me some frame gains, although removing the png overlay yields the most frames.p  pMy current thought is that at startup, I should render 6 paths 1 for each color piece I have and overlay them with the png and then store an image of these pieces and then just redraw the pieces each time I need them. Is there an effecient machanism for storing something youve drawn once and redrawing it It kinda just sounds like Id be running into the whole drawing pngs too often thing again, but maybe theres a less taxing method that does a similar thing...p  pAny suggestions are much appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 1995 pIm part of a team tasked to revamping our old VB6 UICOBOL database application to modern times.  Before I was hired, the decision was made largely on sales, Im sure to redo the UI before the database.  So, now were using WPF and MVVM to great effect, its been amazing so far, especially using CSLA as our Model layer.p  pHowever, because our development is sidebyside with the next version of the old product, were constrained a bit.  We cant make any changes or minimal changes to the calls made to the COBOL database.  This has been fine so far, albeit pining back to the glory days of SQL Server if you can believe it.p  pWhere Ive hit a particularly nasty roadblock regarding our BO design is in dealing with light business objects returned in lists and their full counterparts.  Let me try and construct an examplep  pLets say we have a person object in the DB with a bunch of fields.  When we do a search on that table, we dont return all the fields, so we populate our lite object with these.  These fields may or may not be a subset of the full person.  We may have done a join or two to retrieve some other information specific to the search.  But, if we want to edit our person object, we have to make another call to get the full version to populate the UI.  This leaves us with two objects and attempting to juggle their state in 1 VM, all the while trying to keep the person list in sync on whatever parent object it sits after delete, edit, and add.  Originally, I made our lite person object derive from ReadOnlyBaselt.  But now that Im dealing with the same list behavior youd have with a list of full BOs except with half full, half lite, Im thinking I shouldve just made both the lite and full versions derive from BusinessBaselt and simply made the lite version setter properties private.p  pHas anyone else out there come across and found a solution for this  After sleeping on it, Ive come up with this potential solution.  What if we wrap the full and lite version of our BO in another BO, like thisp  precodepublic class PersonFull  BusinessBaseltPersonFullgt    ...  public class PersonLite  BusinessBaseltPersonLitegt    ...   public class Person  BusinessBaseltPersongt    public PersonFull PersonFull   public PersonLite PersonLite  public class PersonList  BusinessListBaseltPersonList, Persongt   codepre  pObviously everything would be CSLA registered properties and such, but for the sake of brevity theyre fields there.  In this case Person and PersonList would hold all the factory methods.  After a search operation PersonList would be populated by Person objects whose PersonLite members were all populated and the PersonFull objects were all null.  If we needed to get the full version, we simply tell the Person object to do so, and now we have our PersonFull object so we can populate the edit UI.  If the Person object is to be deleted, we can easily do this with the CSLA delete procedures in place, while still maintaining the integrity of our lists across all the VMs that are listening to it.p  pSo, I hope this made sense to everyone, and if anyone has a different solution theyve successfully employed or criticism of this one, by all meansp  pThanksp  pReposted from  a hrefhttpforums.lhotka.netforumsthread35576.aspx relnofollowhttpforums.lhotka.netforumsthread35576.aspxap

Negative 1995 pIm working on putting together a simple POC app using Fluent NHibernate to attempt to show that it can do everything our current handrolled data access tool and so much more. One of the fringe cases that my boss is worried about is the ability to access multiple schemas within the same database in one query. So far I have been able to pull data from tables in both schemas so long as the query only touches one schema at a time. If I try to execute a command that will join tables from both schemas, it blows up.  p  pBased on the error messages that Im seeing, I dont believe that the problem is with joining across schemas, but rather with the fact that the two fields I need to join the tables on are both nonkey fields. The structure of the two table is something like thisp  pre Customer in schema 1  int CustomerId Primary Key string Name ...other fields  Order in schema 2   int OrderId primary key string CustomerName ...other fields pre  pUsing sql directly I can join on the NameCustomerName fields and get the data from both tables.  However, using NHibernate I keep getting an System.FormatException  Input string was not in a correct format when trying to pull data from the Order table and include data from the Customer table. This leads me to believe that NHibernate is trying to join on the CustomerName field and CustomerId field. p  pI know how to tell it to use the CustomerName field in my Order mapping, but I cant figure out a way to telling to join on the Name field of the Customer table. p  pMy Mappings look something like thisp  precodepublic class CustomerMap  ClassMapltCustomergt      public CustomerMap              Idx gt x.Id             .ColumnCustomerId         Mapx gt x.Name         public class OrderMap  ClassMapltOrdergt      public OrderMap              Schemaschema2         Idx gt x.Id             .ColumnOrderID         Mapx gt x.CustomerName             .ColumnCustomerName         ReferencesltCustomergtx gt x.Customer, CustomerName       codepre  pThe SQL Id write to get the results I want would be something likep  precodeselect o.OrderId, o.CustomerName, c.CustomerId from order o inner join customer c on c.Name  o.CustomerName codepre  pIs this even possible  Is there a differentbetter way to go about thisp

Negative 1995 pIm very new to Silverlight. Ive downloaded VS 2010 so that I can mess around with silverlight in a more graphical way and without having to pay a ton of money for Expression Blend 3.. So please have mercy if this is an obvious question.p  pBy default, in a tree view, all of the nodes are collapsed. I can get these to expand, but I want for them to always be expanded, but also not grayed out like they are when you disable the control. Whats the easiest way of doing this I basically just dont want that expandcollapse button therep  pAlso, I dislike how much space the tree nodes take up. I just have one line of text in each node. I would like it to be a little less spaced out. Right now it looks about like triple spacing between it, and Id like something closer to single spacing or 1.5 spacing. p
Negative 1995 pI have a WCF service with many methods. I would like that after executing one of the methods emails will be send to some users. Sending emails may be a long running operation and I dont want a caller of the method to await this time.

I was thinking about sending the emails in a new thread, but I am not sure if it is correct to start new threads when WCF service is hosted in IIS. Could somebody tell me what is the best practice in such casesp  pThanks in advance Lukasz Glazp

Negative 1995 pI have two tables Plants and Information. For every plant there are many information, but for each plant there is a single MainInformation.

I want both fields in both tables not to be nulls.

Negative 1995 pIm sure Im missing something pretty obvious, but I cant for the life of me stop my pysqlite scripts crashing out with a database is locked error. I have two scripts, one to load data into the database, and one to read data out, but both will frequently, and instantly, crash depending on what the other is doing with the database at any given time. Ive got the timeout on both scripts set to 30 secondsp  precodecx  sqlite.connectdatabase.sql, timeout30.0 codepre  pAnd think I can see some evidence of the timeouts in that I get what appears to be a timing stamp e.g 0.12343827e06 0.1  and how do I stop that being printed dumped occasionally in the middle of my Curses formatted output screen, but no delay that ever gets remotely near the 30 second timeout, but still one of the other keeps crashing again and again from this. Im running a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRedHatEnterpriseLinux relnofollowRHELa 5.4 on a 64bit 4 CPU HS21 IBM blade, and have heard some mention about issues about multithreading and am not sure if this might be relevant. Packages in use are sqlite3.3.65 and pythonsqlite1.1.71.2.1, and upgrading to newer versions outside of Red Hats official provisions is not a great option for me. Possible, but not desirable due to the environment in general.p  pI have had codeautocommit1code on previously in both scripts, but have since disabled on both, and I am now codecx.commitcodeing on the inserting script and not committing on the select script. Ultimately as I only ever have one script actually making any modifications, I dont really see why this locking should ever happen. I have noticed that this is significantly worse over time when the database has gotten larger. It was recently at 13 MB with 3 equal sized tables, which was about 1 days worth of data. Creating a new file has significantly improved this, which seems understandable, but the timeout ultimately just doesnt seem to be being obeyed.p  pAny pointers very much appreciated.p  pEDIT since asking I have been able to restructure my code slightly and use a signal to periodically write between 0 and 150 updates in one transaction every 5 seconds. This has significantly reduced the occurrences of the locking, to less than one an hour as opposed to once every minute or so. I guess I could go further by ensuring the times I write data are offset by a few seconds as I read data in the other script, but fundamentally Im working around an issue as I percieve it, making a timeout not required, which doesnt seem right still.

Negative 1995 pBTLDRB When browsing a programs DataGridView controls properties using ManagedSpy it causes that program to allocate its DataGridView data as XML in its memory. How can I cause that same thing to happen from my program its not quite a DataGridView, the control is called Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.UltraGridp  pBFull StoryBp  pIm using ManagedSpy httpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc163617.aspx to spy on a program that well refer to as DataProgram. Please refer to Figure 2 on that page for a screenshot of ManagedSpy.p  pDataProgram has a DataGridViewish full of information that I need. It also has an option to export that info to an excel file. Id rather have the option to export it to CSV into my Clipboard.p  pWhen I walk through DataPrograms controls on ManagedSpys treeview, I can find the exact DataGridView that I need the info from. I know its the right one because I can rightclick it and choose Show Window and itll flash a box around the control.p  pHeres the weird part Right when I leftclick it to view its properties on the right side of ManagedSpys window, something magical happens. The whole table is allocated inside DataPrograms memory as XML, so that with the help of a memory scanner I can see that the whole table is right there in front of my eyes... and then the Garbage Collector takes it away. But its there for some good 30 seconds or so of course it varies, with the GC being nondeterministic. By the way, the control class is Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.UltraGrid, and its like a beefed up DataGridView I imagine.p  pHeres my question As you can see I want to read DataPrograms memory at the precise point it has the XML table allocated. I know how to read the memory already using ReadProcessMemory. Id like to learn how I can trigger DataProgram to allocate that XML table from my program just like ManagedSpy does. Mind you, ManagedSpys source code is available from the website but Im not able to debug it because it only runs as administrator and for some reason I cant make it run. I just need to know how I can, from my program, provoke DataProgram to create that XML info so that I can read it from its memory.p

After sending the mail a new view opens say screen C and here i want to give the user the options .  1. Go to Screen A  which is main screen of the app   2. Go back to Screen B  from where the user requested to send a mail to his frnd .p  pNow the strange part i cannot declare the variables  Screen A and B  of both these files here at in header file of screen C .

Here the InvalidCastException comes from the fact that the DragampDrop API returns an array to the .NET method, and I try to cast it at runtime into a string. At that point, the process is running purely .NET code. Why would it raise the exception only when automatic break on unhandled exceptions is activatedp  pVdesmedTs answer bring a new light to the matter but it looks like it explains why Explorer would not complain if my application failed to process the Drop event.p

Negative 1995 pim kinda digging in java and I just stopped by using packages.

Negative 1995 pI am developing a Gtk application using gtkmm on Windows Vista with Visual Studio 2005. The application works fine on the development machine but I have received crash reports after it has been run on Windows XP machines both Service Pack 2 and 3. I distribute the app with the directory structure described in a hrefhttplive.gnome.orggtkmmMSWindows relnofollowhttplive.gnome.orggtkmmMSWindowsa and it had given me no problems so far.p  pThe crash gives no error messages except for Windows asking whether I want to report the error.p  pIn order to solve the problem, I tried to compile the program against different versions of gtkmm a recent stable version gtkmmwin32devel2.16.04 and an older version gtkmmwin32devel2.10.111 but the problem persisted.p  pI hunted down the problem to a call to windowcreatecairocontext inside the onexposeevent of a GtkDrawingArea. When I commented out this call, the problem would disappear. So I wrote the following minimal program, which still crashesp  precodeinclude ltgtkmm.hgt     include ltiostreamgt  class MyWindow  public GtkWindow      bool onexposeeventGdkEventExpose event          stdcout ltlt expose ltlt stdendl          GlibRefPtrltGdkWindowgt window  getwindow         ifwindow              stdcout ltlt win ltlt stdendl             stdcout ltlt Get cairo ltlt stdendl             CairoRefPtrltCairoContextgt cr  windowgtcreatecairocontext             stdcout ltlt Get cairo done ltlt stdendl          else              stdcout ltlt no win ltlt stdendl                   return true        int main int argc, char argv[]      GtkMain margc,argv     MyWindow w     m.runw     return 0  codepre  pThis minimal app may run and display the window without problem, but if I move the window off the screen limits or if I minimizemaximize it enough times thus triggering calls to onexposeevent, it will eventually crash. It may also be the case that it wont crash the first time, but it will crash after restarting the app and triggering multiple calls to onexposeevent as described above. One thing Ive noticed is that the app crashes emafterem printing Get cairo done. When I comment out the call to createcairocontext, the problem dissapears, so Im pretty sure there is something wrong with this line.p  pThe error happens on clean installed Windows XP machines. I have tested both apps original and minimal on a colleagues notebook, which also has Windows XP, but it doesnt crash there. I suppose there is some dependency that is availableup to date in our computers but not in the computers where the application crashes. I have updated DirectX and installed Visual Studio C 2005 Redistributable on one of the problematic machines, but the problem persists.p  pThe original app, which draws a graph on the DrawingArea, doesnt necessarily crash the first time either. It may work fine the first time after rebooting, but is more prone to fail the second time.p  pI am thinking about compiling and testing with MinGW to see if that solves the problem. Ill also try to compile a debug version and try to use a debugger. I have suspected the version of gdi32.dll might have something to do, seeing that libcairo2.dll depends on this dll according to Dependency Walker, but until now its just an speculation. Other than that, Im out of ideas.p  pIll be trying these ideas for the time being. Hopefully someone has more suggestions or knows what is going on with the code above.p

Given an arbitrary number which may or may not be an exact match for one of the array elements, how can I return the index of the number which is the closest matchp  pFor example, using the following arrayp  ul li1.8li li2.4li li2.7li li3.1li li4.5li ul  pQuerying 2.5 would return with an index of 1, corresponding to the value of 2.4.p  pBonus points for detecting values that lie completely outside of the range of the array elements. For example, using the array listed above, your code may decide that 4.6 is in, but 5.9 is out. If you want to try this part of the question, the specifics are in your hands.p

Negative 1995 pWeve implemented an audiovideo collaboration application on top of Silverlight, and are trying to tune it.  One of the issues were experiencing is an increase in stream latency whenever a packet is dropped we have to wait for the packet loss to be detected, requested, and then for the lost packet to be resent.  Of course, this plays hell with the consistency of our audio stream.  Wed switch over to UDP if we could, but Silverlight doesnt support that inbrowser.  Weve also disabled the Nagle algorithm, so in general, as soon as we submit a byte[] array to be transmitted, its transmitted, and in a single packet.  Im aware that TCP packet size  amount of data submitted, but with the Nagle algorithm disabled, its close.  And we have an adaptive jitter buffer, so we emcanem deal with lost packets, but a lost packet over TCPIP massively increases the amount of audio we need to buffer, and hence latency.p  pSo were trying to optimize how we send our packets, to see if theres any way to reduce the impact of dropped packets.  We currently have several competing solutions that were thinking about implementingp  p1 We could try to make our packets larger.  Currently, we send a mix of large 1024 byte video packets and small 70 byte audio packets over the same TCP stream.  But we could multiplex the audio and video data together, i.e., by attaching some of our video data to our audio packets whenever theres room.  This would make the individual packets somewhat larger, but would cut down on the total number of packets.p  p2 We could split the audio and video into two separate TCP streams.  This means that if the video stream stalled because of a lost packet, the audio stream wouldnt stall, and vice versa.  Of course, it would slightly increase the overhead, and wouldnt cut down on the overall number of packets sent.p  p3 We could inverse multiplex the audio into multiple separate TCP streams, and then reassemble them on the far side.  This would effectively allow us to fake a single UDP style of packet delivery.  If we had 8 audio streams, and one of them stalled because of a lost packet, the other streams would still be able to deliver their data on time, and all wed have to do is deal with 18 of the audio packets being unavailable until the stalled stream caught back up.  Thats not ideal, of course, but it might result in a better experience than to have the entire stream stall, and not being able to play emanyem packets until the lost packet is retransmitted.p  pAny thoughts on any of these possibilities Any other suggestions  Or do we just need to code up all three, and then test themp

Negative 1995 pThe web application I am developing using MyFaces 2.0.3  PrimeFaces 2.2RC2 is divided into a content and a navigation area. In the navigation area, which is included into multiple pages using templating i.e. codeltuidefinegtcode, there are some widgets e.g. a navigation tree, collapsible panels etc. of which I want to preserve the component state across views.p  pFor example, lets say I am on the home page. When I navigate to a product details page by clicking on a product in the navigation tree, my Java code triggers a redirect using p  precodenavigationHandler.handleNavigationcontext, null,   detailspage.jsffacesredirecttrue codepre  pAnother way of getting to that details page would be by directly clicking on a product teaser that is shown on the home page. The corresponding codelthlinkgtcode would lead us to the details page.p  pIn both cases, the expansion state of my navigation tree a PrimeFaces tree component and my collapsible panels is lost. I understand this is because the redirect  codehlinkcode results in the creation of a new view.p  pWhat is the best way of dealing with this I am already using MyFaces Orchestra in my project along with its conversation scope, but I am not sure if this is of any help here since Id have to bind the expansioncollapsed state of the widgets to a backing bean... but as far as I know, this is not possible. Is there a way of telling JSF which component states to propagate to the next view, assuming that the same component exists in that viewp  pI guess I could need a pointer into the right direction here. Thanksp  hr  pstrongUpdate 1strong I just tried binding the panels and the tree to a sessionscoped bean, but this seems to have no effect. Also, I guess I would have to bind all child components if any manually, so this doesnt seem like the way to go.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong Binding UI components to nonrequest scoped beans is not a good idea see link I posted in a comment below. If there is no easier approach, I might have to proceed as followsp  ul liWhen a panel is collapsed or the tree is expanded, save the current state in a sessionscoped backing bean  the UI component itselfli liThe components states are stored in a map. The map key is the components hopefully unique, relative ID. I cannot use the whole absolute component path here, since the IDs of the parent naming containers might change if the view changes, assuming these IDs are generated programmatically.li liAs soon as a new view gets constructed, retrieve the components states from the map and apply them to the components. For example, in case of the panels, I can set the codecollapsedcode attribute to a value retrieved from my sessionscoped backing bean.li ul  pstrongUpdate 3strong I got it working as described above. To sum it up, the solution is to store the relevant properties in a sessionscoped bean instead of making the entire UIComponent sessionscoped. Then, when the component is reconstructed after navigation has occurred, set the attribute values by retrieving the saved properties using EL, e.g.p  precodeltppanel collapsedbackingBean.collapsedState ... gt codepre  pThis is a simplified example. Since I am using multiple panels, I am using a map to store these properties, as described above.p

Negative 1995 pFirst Ill write example to properly address the question.p  pFirst of all, Ill declare template to be used to create singleton object not autocreated bsingletonbase.hbp  precodetemplate ltclass Derivedgt class SingletonBase    public     static Derived instance  assertsinstance return dynamiccastltDerivedgtsinstance    protected     SingletonBase  assertsinstance0 sinstancethis      virtual SingletonBase  assertsinstance sinstance0    private     static SingletonBase sinstance   template ltclass Derivedgt SingletonBaseltDerivedgt SingletonBaseltDerivedgtsinstance  0 codepre  pNow we can declare any class that derived from template, and each derived class should have its own sinstance.

Unlike with regular static data members I have not specified where it should be allocated. I would, of course, like to have codeSingletonBaseltChild1gtsinstancecode and codeSingletonBaseltChild2gtsinstancecode in bchild1.ob and bchild2.ob respectively, but is that something I can expect or enforcep  pThe issue gets more complicated if I put codeChild1code and codeChild2code into two distinct libraries  blib1b and blib2b. Inside codeChild2staticInvokeBothcode there is a call to codeChild1instancecode. As far as I understand, default gccs behaviour is to generate a copy of codeSingletonBaseltChild1gtsinstancecode in each compilation unit, thus one copy will be emitted in blib2b. p  pWill it also generate a copy of codeSingletonBaseltChild1gtsinstancecode in blib2b Definitely, one copy of codeSingletonBaseltChild1gtsinstancecode should be in blib1b. If those two libraries are later used together in one application, can I be sure that there is only one instance of codeSingletonBaseltChild1gtsinstancecode and that both codeChild1staticInvokeOnecode and codeChild2staticInvokeBothcode are using itp  pIs it generally safe to use this approach with statics wrapped in template, or are there any drawbacksp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 1995 pI am very new to live555 media server but I am trying to use it as the backbone to develop a simple video and audio streaming server using android as the client.  I have been desperately testing and have managed to encode a simple test video in H.264 with the extension .264 and streamed it to the handset using the complete live555 media server.  The problem with this is I constructed the .264 file from a raw avi recording and lowered its spec considerably making the fame size 320X240 and bit rate and frame rate very low. I really want my system to be able to stream any mp4 file which live555 does not support at the moment but is natively supported by android. p  pCan I implement this formats into the live555 code without knowing too much about encoding or streaming  If this is not possible for me can some body please advise me on the next steps to take. I am quite sure that trying to encode the mp4 to a raw .264 file upon request at the server is very far from the right answer but atm it is the only format I can stream. Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated.  p
Negative 1995 pIm only interested in handling GET or POST requests, so I designed this abstract class to determine which request has been made and to subsequently call the appropriate function. I would really appreciate feedback on this.

Either an HTML form will be submitted via POST, or a redirect will be made with a query string, which will be a GET request. I am not familiar with how a mixed request could be made both GET and POST, but since this is a personal project I have control over whether it happens or not.p  pI use the codeAHttpRequestHandlercode class above by implementing the codehandleGetRequestcode and codehandlePostRequestcode methods in a subclass, which is and abstract controller, codeAControllercode.

Negative 1995 pFirst off This is not another question about how to load a policy file.p  pI have an app in development that connects to a socket server, gets the policy file and works just dandy. However, when the socket server is down for whatever reason, I need to gracefully fallback to an alternative method of getting messages from the server polling, basically.p  pThis is not a problem, except for one thingp  precodeError Request for resource at xmlsocket[ip]4770 by requestor from http[ip]cookingClient.swf has failed because the server cannot be reached. codepre  pThere doesnt appear to be a way to catch this. I have these event listeners on my socketp  precodeaddEventListenerEvent.CLOSE, closeHandler addEventListenerEvent.CONNECT, connectHandler addEventListenerIOErrorEvent.IOERROR, ioErrorHandler addEventListenerSecurityErrorEvent.SECURITYERROR, securityErrorHandler addEventListenerProgressEvent.SOCKETDATA, socketDataHandler codepre  pSecurityErrorEvent is what you might think fires, but it doesnt. The docs say it fires for these reasonsp  ol liLocal untrusted SWF files may not communicate with the Internet. You can work around this limitation by reclassifying the file as localwithnetworking or as trusted. li liYou cannot specify a socket port higher than 65535.li liIn the HTML page that contains the SWF content, the allowNetworking parameter of the object and embed tags is set to none.li ol  pSo none of those apply. It appears what I really want to catch is the failure of the policy file to load, but even doing an explicit Security.loadPolicyFile wont help, since that load is deferred to the first socket request AND doesnt fire any events.p  pFor completeness, I also surrounded the call to connect with a trycatch e, no result.p  pTheres got to be a way to sort this. Any ideas I simply need a way to tell when the connection has failed because of networking issues and try an alternate path.p  pEDIT Despite my previous tests and the docs, it appears SecurityErrorEvent does fire  only it does it about 20 seconds after the load fails, so its not obvious. I guess thats as immediate as Im going to get from Flash.p
Negative 1995 pstrongUpdatestrong problem was caused by loading wrong page in browser. Solved now. p  pIn the image you can see the front page of an iPhone webpage I am developing using the OReilly book by Jonathan Stark. The image shows  iphone.html see below which is just a bunch of links, which, when clicked will load the content from index.html see below using the ajax in the jquery.js see below.  A live version of the site is available at www.quoraquora.comp  pAt the very bottom of the jquery file, there is a function which removes the content of the h2 and puts it in the h1. The operative code is this. p  precodevar title  h2.html  Hello     h1.htmltitle     h2.remove     progress.remove      codepre  pSo if you were to click About link, then About will appear in the toolbar.

The codeUIButtonscode are sitting on a codeUIScrollViewcode, so the codeUIScrollViewcodes codecontentSizecode should also grow if there are more strongcodedataItemscodestrong so the buttons can scroll offscreen if there are say, 30 codedataItemscode.p  pnbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbspimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrtuyS.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1995 pI know that Go is little different to other languages in this respect, but I wondered if it would be worthwhile for the Go language to automatically test for nil pointers on comparisons and return unequal if only one of the values is nil in a comparison rather than creating a runtime error. Go is so great in so many areas I just thought it might do it. The case in point is as followsp  precode type cuForm struct sName string iUseCount int64 baForm []byte  var pugForm cuForm   func loadForm sWanted string cuForm, os.Error        if sWanted  pugForm.sName  codepre  pIn the above example, if pugForm is nil, a runtime error occurs. Obviously if only one of the values is nil, it cannot be equal  logically at least. There may well be a reason why this shouldnt be done, but I dont think history should be one reason.p

Negative 1995 pI have a WPF application and I need to print from it. I had previously posted a question about printing without needing to display a confirmation window and got a great answer that I have implemented like the followingp  precodevar pq  LocalPrintServer.GetDefaultPrintQueue var writer  PrintQueue.CreateXpsDocumentWriterpq var paginator  newPass.docMain.Document.DocumentPaginator writer.Writepaginator codepre  pThis code works just fine and simple  it basically just picks up the local printer que and sends the XPS document. However, it is relatively slow to print. Ive tried to narrow down the possibilities and it looks like the greatest speed difference is between WinXP and Win7 machines. On XP it is slow, but acceptable, at about 23 seconds to print while on Win7 it can be upwards of 10 seconds and 15 seconds is not uncommon. Is there a reason why this code would have such a difference in speed Also, Ive noticed that there are a few questions on here about WPF print speeds  is there a reason why WPF printing in general is slowp

Negative 1995 pIm trying to understand some Ccode, I have been handed, which deals with cryptography, and specifically uses codePasswordDeriveBytescode from codeSystem.Security.Cryptographycode.p  pIn the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.security.cryptography.passwordderivebytes.aspx.NET docsa , it says that codePasswordDeriveBytescode uses an extension of the PBKDF1 algorithm which is later in the document specified as the PKCS5 v2.0 standard, which is PBKDF2 as far as I can tell. Everywhere on the net Ive found including here on Stack Exchange, though, everyone says use Rfc2898DeriveBytes, cause Password is deprecated and uses PBKDF1. But the only difference in the docs at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.commsdn.microsoft.coma seems to be that the Rfcversion specifically mentions PBKDF2, where Password says extension of PBKDF1 and PKCS5 v 2.0. p  pSo, can anyone tell me what the difference is between the two classes if any and why I should use one rather than the other for PBKDF2 password key derivationp  pNow, other code, that deals with the same data, explicitly uses PBKDF2, and works, so that would suggest that indeed codePasswordDeriveBytescode also uses PBKDF2, or that PBKDF2 is simply compatible with PBKDF1 under certain circumstances, but I want to know for sure that its not some side effect of some random thing, and that things just magically works and eventually probably will magically and spectacularly break without anyone really understanding why.p

What Ive come up with is this greatly simplified here, so that shapes are equal to all other shapes of the same typep  precodeclass Shape  public     virtual bool equalsShape othershape  0 protected     virtual bool isequalCircleamp circle  return false      virtual bool isequalRectangleamp rect  return false      friend class Circle     so Rectangleequals can access Circleisequal     friend class Rectangle  and vice versa   class Circle  public Shape  public     virtual bool equalsShape othershape  return othershapegtisequalthis  protected     virtual bool isequalCircleamp circle  return true    class Rectangle  public Shape  public     virtual bool equalsShape othershape  return othershapegtisequalthis  protected     virtual bool isequalRectangleamp circle  return true   codepre  pThis works, but I have to add a separate codeequalscode function and codefriendcode declaration in codeShapecode for each derived class. Then I have to copypaste the strongexact same codeequalscode functionstrong into each derived class, too. This is an awful lot of boilerplate for say, 10 different shapesp  h2Is there a simpler way to do ith2  pcodedynamiccastcode is out of the question too slow. Yes, I benchmarked it. Speed matters in my app.p  pI tried this but it doesnt workp  precodeclass Shape  public     virtual bool equalsShape othershape  0 private     virtual bool isequalShapeamp circle  return false    class Circle  public Shape  public     virtual bool equalsShape othershape  return othershapegtisequalthis  private     virtual bool isequalCircleamp circle  return true    class Rectangle  public Shape  public     virtual bool equalsShape othershape  return othershapegtisequalthis  private     virtual bool isequalRectangleamp circle  return true   codepre  pcodeequalscode always returns false, even on identical shapes. It seems dispatch is always choosing the codeisequalShapeampcode base function, even when a more specific match is available. This probably makes sense but I dont understand C dispatch well enough to know why.p

Negative 1995 pIve started using git on github and have a newbie workflow question. Apologies beforehand if the description is longwinded but I wanted to describe what Im thinking as Im going through the process so you can correct me. Im also using Eclipse EGIT plugin, which I realize will never be as good as using command line but just bear with me. p  pOur project is set up such that my partner owns a master repo and Im a private collaborator. Whenever I push, I push directly to his repo. In general were OK with committing, pulling and pushing, as long as there are no conflicts. Problem occurs whenever there are conflicts. Heres an examplep  ol liMy partner and I start off my pulling the latest code into our respective working repos. No probs. li liI modify FileA and FileB, add, commit, and push them both. No probs.li liMeanwhile, my partner modifies FileA, then attempts a pull to get my updates.li liEclipse stronggives him an errorstrong CheckOut conflict with FileAli lipWe venture into git bash land and get a more useful message upon executing git pull p  perror Your local changes ... written by merge FileA. Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.pli lipOK, fair enough. He commits his changes FileA, and attempts to pull again through Eclipse.pli lipHe gets a message indicating FileA conflict. Good, this is expected. He now proceeds to resolve the conflict on FileA, and does a git add on FileA to indicate its resolved. pli lipHes now ready to commit and push. He expects his merged changes to FileA to be pushed. But now, the following is the part I dont get. Even though he did not modify FileB at all, Eclipse determines it to be part of his commit by default, so he needs to manually uncheck it to avoid recommitting FileB, and thus avoid pushing FileB since no changes were made to it. But even doing so results in FileB being pushed upstream. As a result, not only does he end up pushing FileA, but also FileB.pli ol  pI would like to know whether we are doing things the right way, and since were probably not, advice appreciated.p

Negative 1995 pIm writing an android app where you have a recursive function that takes a string and returns all the permutatins of that string and all its substrings. This approach was time consuming especially with longer strings. I went on this site and asked if there was a more efficient way of permuting a string and a couple of people suggested a Trie tree. Surely enough the trie was way faster but whatve also noticed that the Trie performance improves with longer strings. For example, using a 7 char long string the Trie is about 2.5 times faster. A 10 char string the Trie is about 5 times faster and 12 char string the Trie is about 10 times faster. Does anyone know why the Tries performance gets better with longer stringsp

Obviously, the part in the middle is much longer in practice.p  pThe essence of my question is How can I invert this operationp  pemThe sound file is transmitted to the recipient via simple playback and recording of the sound. That means I am not trying to decode the original sound file which would be easy.emp  pObviously I have to analyze the recorded data with respect to frequency.

Jim Lambs blogs talk about using a custom activity which uses the current date to set the version number and John Robbins blog talks about getting the last assembly version and doing everything in MSBuild since there are no extra dependencies. p  pCurrently we are using a 4 place version number such as 3.8.0.2 then we increment the last number for each build. We use this version to synce all the assemblies. We would like to stay with this format and Id like to handle all my versioning in workflow however I dont know how to read the last version from an assembly that way. Im thinking this will require writing a custom activity but what method would I use to read last version p  pThanks in advance Jimp
Negative 1995 pWhen I setup my computer for Git, I generate a private and public SSH key. I then let GitHub know what my public key is.

Negative 1995 pI currently have an application that can show a video preview stream and take a picture from that stream.  The problem is the app needs to run on low end machines ie. nettops, and when the video preview stream is set to a high resoultion, it kills the framerates.  So my questions arep  ol liCan the Lifecam preview the stream at a low resolution, but snap pictures at a higher resolution via the Preview pinli liBy doing so, will it actually increase performance  The preview should run buttery smooth 30fps at 320x240 but take snapshots at 1080p.li liHow will all the auto adjustments be affected by this  Will the auto adjustments apply when the snapshot is takenli liWill there be a significant lag when taking the pictureli ol  pIm not too familiar with DirectShow and the 3rd party control im using doesnt seem to support this mode.  After some reading, i cant tell definitively whether or not the LifeCam Studio is capable of this.  Testing with the AForge Snapshot Maker, it wasnt able to set snapshot resolution, which suggests that the Lifecam isnt capable of this.  But of course, it could just be a problem with the software.  I just need to know of the Lifecams capablilities before investing the time to implement the functionality.  I figured someone already went through the trouble of figuring this out and would like to share their findings.  Thanks in advancep

Negative 1995 pCurrently I am using the DTWGestureRecognizer open source tool for Kinect SDK v1.5. I have recorded a few gestures and use them to navigate through Windows 7. I also have implemented voice control for simple things such as opening PowerPoint, Chrome, etc. p  pMy main issue is that the application uses quite a bit of my CPU power which causes it to become slow. During gestures and voice commands, the CPU usage sometimes spikes to 8090, which causes the application to be unresponsive for a few seconds. I am running it on a 64 bit Windows 7 machine with an i5 processor and 8 GB of RAM. I was wondering if anyone with any experience using this tool or Kinect in general has made it more efficient and less performance hogging. p  pRight now I removed sections which display the RGB video and the Depth video but even doing that did not make a big impact. Any help is appreciated, thanksp

Negative 1995 pIve a question regarding the use of the transaction manager in a context with EJB, Spring and Hibernate. In our project we have an EJB stateless marked with the annotation TransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED. No further transaction has been defined so far.p  pNow every EJB calls a service. The latter is only a delegates the redirect the call to the final DAO. In every DAO we use the HibernateTemplate the problem is that the session is closed soon after every getload methods inside the DAOs. Whyp  pIf I replace the HibernateTemplate with the classic Hibernate Session best approach and I call getSession.getTransaction.isActive I get always false, but the session is still active till the end of the service call the delegates mentioned above. After this the session closed.  Why do I have this different behaviours  Isnt Springhibernate able to see the EJB transaction attribute p  pThanks in advance.p  pFabiop

Negative 1995 pAs described in the answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1074781doubleinhashmapDouble in HashMapa, Doubles shouldnt be used in HashMaps because they are difficult to compare for equality. I believe my case is different, but I thought Id ask to make sure since I didnt see anything about this.p  pIm going to have a series of double values associated with objects, and I want them to be sorted by the double values. Is TreeMap an appropriate solution Would there be a better one The double values are generated a bunch of math, so the likelihood of a duplicate value is extremely low.p  pEDIT I should clarify all I need is to have this list of objects sorted by the doubles theyre associated with. The values of the doubles will be discarded and Ill never call codemap.getkeycodep

Negative 1995 pIn case if I dont know the probabilities of accessing each element, but Im sure that some elements will be accessed far more often then the others, I will use a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSplaytree relnofollow titleSplay treeSplay treea. What should I use if I already know all the probabilities I assume that there should be some data structure that is better than splay trees for this case.p  pIm trying to imagine all the cases where and when should I use every type of the search trees. Maybe someone can post some links to articles about comparison of all the search trees, and similar structuresp  pstrongEDITstrong Id like to still have codeOlog ncode as the worst case, but in avarage it should be faster.  Splay trees are good example, but Id like to predefine the configuration of this tree. p  pFor example, I have an array of elements to store code[a1, a2, .. an]code, and the probabilities for each element code[p1, p2, .. pn]code, which define how often I will access each element. I can create splay tree, add each element to the splay tree codeOn log ncode, and then access them with given probabilities to make the desired tree. So if I have probabilities code[12, 14, 14]code, I need to splay the first element, to make it be among the first. So, I need to order elements by probabilities, and splay them in the order from the lowest to the highest access probability. That takes codeOn log ncode also. So, overall time of building such tree is codeOn log ncode with a big constant.  My goal is to lower this number.p  pI do not mind using something else, but not search tree, but Id like for the time to be lower then in case of Splay tree. And I want search, insert and delete be in the range of codeOlog ncode amortized.p

W3s feed validation indicate that my RSS is not validate, here the result a hrefhttpvalidator.w3.orgappccheck.cgiurlhttpmalaysia60.infoberitasindex.rss relnofollowhttpvalidator.w3.orgappccheck.cgiurlhttp3A2F2Fmalaysia60.info2Fberitas2Findex.rssap  pIve no idea whats wrong. Ive check and remove extra spaces in the View, RSS default layout and controller in cakephp files.p  pCould someone tell me whats wrong with this RSShelper. Thank you.p
Negative 1995 pI am building an interactive visualization app that is pretty much all clientside javascript, see herep  pa hrefhttpkorhal.andrewmao.net9294classifyAPH10154043 relnofollowhttpkorhal.andrewmao.net9294classifyAPH10154043ap  pTry the following controlsp  ul limousewheel zoomli lidrag empty area panli lidrag bottom area or handles panzoomli liclick once, then click again draw a boxli lidrag on box move boxli lidrag edges of box resizeli ul  pThe underlying mechanism is a SVG overlying a canvas. The canvas has codezindexcode 0 and the SVG codezindexcode 1  feel free to inspect the DOM. Everything works pretty much fine on ChromeFF.p  pThe problem is, in IE9, the canvas seems to receive click events over the SVG, even with a lower zindex. You can tell because the mousewheelclickdrag actions dont work in the main chart area, yet they work in the edge areas because the SVG is slightly larger than the canvas and it picks up the events there. For example, try mousewheeling in the axis areas or the bottom.p  pAfter playing with it some more, I think I saw the pathology. I made a version of the page where I allowed boxes to be drawn outside the canvas graph area but still inside the SVG. Then I could do the following in IEp  ol liDraw a box in the axis area outside of canvasli liDrag it into the main area over the canvasli liHold mouse over the box and use mousewheel  now the zoom events are picked up by the SVG. Mousewheeling where there was no box caused the events to go to the canvas disappear.li ol  pSo it seems what is happening is that the SVG is only picking up mouse events when there is an explicit SVG object under the mouse, otherwise it gets passed through to the canvas, and only in Internet Explorer.p  pOne obvious way to solve this problem is to make a transparent rect over the entire SVG region, but that seems stupid. Also, maybe Im doing something wrong that is patched up when using Chrome but broken in IE. Does anyone have any suggestionsp  pNote One deleted answer suggested wrapping the entire SVG region in a codeltggtcode element and applying codepointerevents allcode to it. However, that didnt work. I dont even think that is necessary, as pointer events are being detected fine in the entire SVG region except where there is a canvas.p

I think this is basically like merge, except with one list.p  pSo my list and data frame look like thisp  precodeDefine the list of lists and the data frame l lt list l[[1]] lt listi1, data15 l[[2]] lt listi2, datarunif5 l[[3]] lt listi1, datarnorm5 d lt data.frameic1, 2, val1cTRUE, FALSE, val2  ca, b codepre  pAnd Id like to end up with p  precodegt lmod[[1]] i [1] 1  data [1] 1 2 3 4 5  newData val1  val2 TRUE     a codepre  pAnd so on for each element of codelmodcode, with codenewDatacode being the appropriate row of codedcode. Note that we can assume that each row of codedcode has a unique value for codedicode.p  pMy current approach is to write a matching function and call it from codelapplycodep  precodematchingRow lt functionindexValue, df    returndf[dfiindexValue, 1]   lmod lt lapplyl, functionx cx, newDatamatchingRowxi, d codepre  pThis basically works, but seems overcomplicated. Also it splits each column of codedcode into a separate element of the new list Id rather it place the whole 1row data frame as a single list element.p  pIs there a simpler way of doing thisp

Negative 1995 pIve got a project with lots of very large media assets totalling several gigabytes. Build  download  run times are very slow, even when I change nothing. A clean build  download  run on iPad can take 20 minutes but even just debugging with no changes can take 5 minutes or more. It seems the bottleneck is at the point where it determines what new assets need copying. Removing most of the assets speeds up the build  download  run cycle. My current workaround is to build with assets, remove them from the project, and as assets are not cleaned up from the device I can work with the quick build times as long as I dont need asset updates.p  pI presume other people have had this issue before and I wondered what fixes  workarounds people have.p  pI have a few ideas, none of which Ive researched enough to know if they are viable or not.p  p1 Have 2 projects, 1 with assets the other with code, both using the same app ID so they both compile to the same app folder on the device. Use the asset build when assets change and the code build for general working.p  p2 Jailbreak my iPad so I can download assets directly into the app folder as needed and just build codep  p3 Use placeholder assets that are tiny and test occasionally with real assets.p  pAny help would be much appreciated.p  pMaxp

Negative 1995 p1 Why do we use codeDTOcode and codeDAOcode, and when should we use them. I am developing a codeGUIcode Java software to do with inserting, editing, deleting data. But I am struggling to distinguish between codeDTODAOcode and codeModelcode, codeViewcode, codeControllercode MVC  Structure Are they similar, which is  better to use when interacting with database through Java codeGUIcode. p  p2 One thing Im really curious about is whether it is a good practice to have codeviewcode and codeControllercode in one class. If we think about codeNetbeanscode, you can create codeGUIcode Frame Class and add components like codeJButtoncode onto the frame, double clicking the button will take you to the codeactionListenercode methodController which appears to be in the frame the data is to be displayed to the user View. So theyre in the same class. Is that completely going against the concept then or not  p  precodelta hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvIwwznm9XSMEgtHere is what Im talking aboutltagt codepre  pbad practice to have view and controller in one class p
Negative 1995 pI am trying to create an MSI that will place two OCX files in the Program Files x86 folder as well as register both the OCX files. p  pThe first of the two OCX files which actually makes use of the 2nd OCX at runtime is successfully registered. The second OCX is not being successfully registered. I know this because if I run regsvr32 on the OCX that is not successfully registering, it then works in the application it is used for.p  pThe registration information for the two OCX files were generated with the harvest tool heat.exe. I used the heat tool on both OCX so I cant understand why OCX registration works for just one of them and not both.p  pHow can I go about debugging thisp

I got as far as installing some dependencies but some dependencies werent versioned so I had to track each version specifically and I eventually gave up.p  pI then just updated the dependency versions emfor libpandocem itself and now Ive got all the dependencies built and linked.p  pThe only remaining issue is that libpandoc needs to be updated to work against the latest Pandoc release 1.10.p
Negative 1995 pHeres the situation.  We have a rails 3.2 app running on heroku, and developers all over the world.  We want to standardise on UTC for everything.  Our team speaks UTC even among ourselves eg. when planning meeting times.  We want the app to do the same.  We can convert things back into peoples local timezones for display at some later point.p  pThe problem is that when I save something into the database for instance, creating a new post in the forums it thinks that my local time as reported by my computer is UTC, and saves it as such.p  pFor example, its lunchtime on Thursday 14th February here in sunny Melbourne, Australia UTC11.  I make a new post, then look in the consolep  precode1.9.3p194 009 gt p  Post.first  gt ltPost id 12, authorid 1, subject Another post , body a very recent one, createdat 20130214 121353, updatedat 20130214 121353, slug test120130214anotherpost, forumid 1gt  1.9.3p194 010 gt p.createdat  gt Thu, 14 Feb 2013 121353 UTC 0000  codepre  pAs you can see, the createdat timestamp is saved as per lunchtime on the 14th, and flagged as being that time emIN UTCem.

Negative 1995 pI was responding to a slough of basic Java practice test questions and the correct answer to the following question slipped past me while taking the test.p  pQuestion  If an exception is not caught, the finally block will run and the rest of the method is skipped  TRUE or FALSEp  pI am attempting to prove out the answer with the ThrowTest class pasted at bottom but I find Java exception handling to be somewhat unfamiliar.

Negative 1995 pWe have a system built using Entity Framework 5 for creating, editing and deleting data but the problem we have is that sometimes EF is too slow or it simply isnt possible to use entity framework Views which build data for tables based on users participating in certain groups in database, etc and we are having to use a stored procedure to update the data.p  pHowever we have gotten ourselves into a problem where we are having to save the changes to EF in order to have the data in the database and then call the stored procedures, we cant use ITransactionScope as it always elevates to a distributed transaction andor locks the tables for selects during the transaction.p  pWe are also trying to introduce a DomainEvents pattern which will queue events and raise them after the save changes so we have the data we need in the DB but then we may end up with the first part succeeding and the second part failing.p  pAre there any good ways to handle this or do we need to move away from EF entirely for this scenariop

Negative 1995 pFacebook graph API allows to retrieve chat messages using GET meoutbox. Is there any way to retrieve the messages sent tofrom a friend using graph API modifiers rather than parsing the entire array of messages.p

Negative 1995 pI am making a call to the SQL database via Entity Framework, this call takes about 2 mins to execute.  I want to make sure this call only occurs once. Once the call is made, I place the results in cache. I notice if multiple users are on the site, it can be more than 2 mins till the data is returned, whats the best way to approach this Should I use a mutex or does Entity Framework version 4 have any functionality built in to handle this type of situation.

Negative 1995 pIm using some custom fonts I added to my project for the titles of codeUIButtoncode. I am not able to set my custom fonts in IB, and Ive read in some posts that it is not possible yet in the last XCode version, is that right So, currently, Im setting the font for the titles programmatically. The point is that, as in IB the font is set to the default, when I set my custom font programmatically it is not centered, I guess because the font I can see in IB for the button has another height and width and this is the size considered to center the title. How could I center the title with my custom fontp  pThanks p

Negative 1995 pIm creating a GWT application that will be accessed by a POST request, which contains parameters I care about user id, etc..p  pAll the reading Ive done so far has led me to believe that I should create a servlet Im using tomcat that will handle the POST parameters and then forward to my GWT application.

In the other hand, I need to identify those positive amounts that do not have a corresponding negative amount by myid , and reportid.p  pexpected result should look like this p  precodeREPORTID                   FUND                        MYID                       ORG                         AMOUNT                       1                           100000                      910                         67150                       40.17                        1                           100000                      910                         67150                       100                          codepre  pany ideas how can acomplish this.p  pemstrongEDITemstrong Posted the wrong output result. Just to be clear the fund and org dont matter until after the match. For example if i was writing this using plsql i would find how many minuses do i have then how many pluses do i have compare each plus amount to each minus amount and delete them then i would be left with whatever plus amounts did not have negative amounts.  I apologize for the confusion. hope this makes it clearer now. once i have all my matches i should end up with only positive amounts that are left behind.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  precodeadditional inserts  Insert into TEST REPORTID,AMOUNT,MYID,FUND,ORG values 5,71,911,100000,67150 Insert into TEST REPORTID,AMOUNT,MYID,FUND,ORG values 5,71,911,100000,67120 Insert into TEST REPORTID,AMOUNT,MYID,FUND,ORG values 5,71,911,100000,67140 Insert into TEST REPORTID,AMOUNT,MYID,FUND,ORG values 5,71,911,100000,67130 Insert into TEST REPORTID,AMOUNT,MYID,FUND,ORG values 5,71,911,100000,67130 Insert into TEST REPORTID,AMOUNT,MYID,FUND,ORG values 5,71,911,100000,67130 Insert into TEST REPORTID,AMOUNT,MYID,FUND,ORG values 5,71,911,100000,67150 Insert into TEST REPORTID,AMOUNT,MYID,FUND,ORG values 5,71,911,100000,67150 Insert into TEST REPORTID,AMOUNT,MYID,FUND,ORG values 5,71,911,100000,67150 codepre
Negative 1995 pIm looking for a way to detect and call a function when a hidden iframe finishes downloading a file or starts downloading the file.  p  pBasically, I have thisp  precodevar iframe  document.getElementByIdprodFrame iframe.src  url to download file prodFrame.loadfunction     enableDownloadFunction  codepre  pWhich doesnt work.  Ive also tried codeiframe.onloadcode and get no results either.  With either of these attempts, the file downloads fine but codeenableDownloadFunctioncode never fires.  The url that loads in the hidden iframe takes about 2 or 3 minutes to do its thing and get the file ready for download.  The actually downloading of the file will only take a second or two.  So, I just want something to happen either when the file begins downloading or has completed downloading  either will work.p  pAlso, I have no access to the server side of things  only client side.  p

I understand pretty well how matrices work however in Java I am finding this a bit complex, so I researched a bit and found this. p  precode    public static int[][] multiplyint a[][], int b[][]      int aRows  a.length,     aColumns  a[0].length,     bRows  b.length,     bColumns  b[0].length     int[][] resultant  new int[aRows][bColumns]       forint i  0 i lt aRows i   aRow        forint j  0 j lt bColumns j   bColumn          forint k  0 k lt aColumns k   aColumn              resultant[i][j]  a[i][k]  b[k][j]                                return resultant codepre  pThis code works fine. However the problem with this is that I need to multiply a single dimension matrix 15 by a multidimensional matrix 54, so the result will be 14 matrix and later on in the same program multiply a 14 matrix by a 43 matrix resulting in 13.    p  pAnd I need to store the single dimension matrix in a normal array double [] not multidimensional onep  pI altered this code to the following but it still doesnt resolve the correct results.p  precode    public static double[] multiplyMatricesdouble[] A, double[][] B      int xA  A.length       int yB  B[0].length            double[] C  new double[yB]            for int i  0 i lt yB i   bColumn             for int j  0 j lt xA j   aColumn                 C[i]  A[j]  B[j][i]                       return C codepre  pThanks in advance for any tips you may give  p

Negative 1995 pI wonder whether there is a performance difference between the .xap package i submitted to the windows phone store and the one served to the end users finally. I am asking because in the book Windows Phone 8 Development Internals there is something like p  blockquote   pIn Windows Phone 8, this process changes, such that all apps are   precompiled as part of the Windows Phone Store submission process.   This means that when a user downloads an app from the Windows Phone   Store, the app package already contains code that is compiled for ARM.   Because no JITing is required when the app is starting up or   running, users should experience faster app load times and improved   runtime performancep blockquote  pThanks p

Negative 1995 pI am some what new to javascript and mvc3 just for your information.p  pI have been having troubles trying to figure out multiple payment models on one view without the javascript getting all messed up. p  pWhat I am trying to dop  pCreate a parent model so that all the children models will have one or two attributes from the parent model.p  pUse javascript in order to get data from the server to gather and post data without messing up each other payments on the view already.p  pIf there is an easier way to collect multiple payments and return them to the control please give me a link or some information to research... Thank youp  pIn the main view all I do is display the first partial view and two buttonspost, add new payment the post button submits the payment to the server, and the new payment adds another partial view payment model.p  pthe issue I am having is getting the partial views to work with the javascript, which only targets the first payment.  I have been looking up this issue for a few days now and cant find a good answer.  The only answer that makes sense to me is to change the ids of all the elements on the partial view and have my javascript reference the updated ids but I dont know how to change the ids dynamically in order for the javascript to change with it.p  pI apologize if I am missing anything, I am new to this stuff.p  pPayment Partial Viewp  precodemodel SBTools.Models.Payment  AJAX TO RETRIEVE BILLING

Negative 1995 pFew days ago all alter table statements executed by openjpa for MySql database slowed down terribly  one statement executes in 5 seconds. My tables are all empty  all the alter statements are only a part of creating test data for my system, so it is not a problem of volume of the data. Executing one statement in such a time is not an option  there is like thousand of alter table statements. p  pI tried to execute all the sql I needed from phpMyAdmin  worked fine and nice, but unfortunately it doesnt solve my problem.p  pMy openjpa version is 2.2.2, MySql 5.6.14p  pIm wondering if migrating the database with flyway has any to do with this terrible performance.p  pDoes anyone has any idea what could be the problemp

Negative 1995 pI need to make a self made codemalloccode simplified a bit. The memory pool is just an array of unsigned chars. Im planning on having a struct that is a  header, containing the size of the memory block, a flag A for allocated, F for free and a pointer to the next header though I guess this isnt necessary because you already have the length of the blockp  pAnywho, I have no idea how to easily store the struct inside the memory pool. This is my current codep  precodeinclude ltstdlib.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  include ex1.h  define POOLSIZE 500   unsigned char mempool[POOLSIZE] unsigned char ptr  ampmempool[0]  typedef struct header Header  Header h  struct header     int size     char flag     Header  next   void mainit     h  Header .size  POOLSIZE  sizeofHeader, .flag  F, .next  NULL  codepre  pNow ofcourse the codehcode Header is not inside the mempool. Logically, int the initialisation it should be codemempool[0]  Header ...code, since this is the first field of the mempool. Of course I could put pointers inside the array, but that would sort of ruin the aspec tof having a mempool.p  pSo how should I store a struct or whatever in a certain location of the arrayp

Then I cannot access the service due to CORS Tried to resolve this but no success. So I managed to use chrome with disablewebsecurity flag to hack the CORS problem I will try to solve this later. Now I can access the service and it works fine but for the functions that have to access the database, they just return empty result.li ol  pSo my question is Is this the normal architecture for this kind of WCF service Generating js proxy to expose service to javascript clients. I write this WCF to expose the service to mobile devices. And if yes, is the CORS that preventing me from accessing the database when calling the service from client javascriptp

Heres a sample of the codep  precodeDim canvas As New Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.ShapeContainer Dim lines20 As PowerPacks.LineShape Dim it As Integer  0  Private Sub GoldenSpiLoadsender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles MyBase.Load     canvas.Parent  Me     lines.Initialize     iter.Text  0 End Sub Private Sub iterTextChangedsender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles iter.TextChanged    If it gt iter.Text And iter.Text ltgt 0 Then         ReDim Preserve linesiter.Text  1    End If    If it ltgt iter.Text Then         it  iter.Text    End If     For i As Integer  1 To iter.Text       linesi  1  New PowerPacks.LineShapecanvas       linesi  1.StartPoint  pAi       linesi  1.EndPoint  pBi       linesi  1.BringToFront    Next End Sub codepre  pAfter I execute the program, the lines are created. But when I give a value to my textbox that is smaller than the variable it, it justs delete the last line and not the rest. Also I saw while debugging that the size of array is reduced. So that means that the contents beyond the size are still kept Why is that. Any help is appreciated.

Negative 1995 pIm using a job queue library, where you define codeJobcodes and post them to a codeJobManagercode. The codeJobManagercode has a codeThreadGroupcode with workers that pull codeJobcodes off of a queue and call codeJob.onRuncode. p  pThe amount of threads are set by giving a max and min amount of threads, a load factor how many outstanding jobs can a worker thread have before creating a new one and an idle timeout for any of the threads above min. Therefore, a worker threads coderuncode will terminate if it has no new jobs, and its idle timeout is reached. p  pIn some codeJobcodes Im using libraries that only expose an async API. Is it safe to use these in onRunp  pFor example, if I want to make a network request that takes a callback which provides me with a response will the callback get calledp  precodeOverride public void onRun throws Throwable      client.doRequestrequest, new Callback          Override         public void onRequestCompleteResponse response              is this guaranteed to get called                   since we now return from onRun will onRequestComplete get called  codepre

Negative 1995 pI have a codeTableViewcode in JavaFX 2.2Java 7 to be specific, where each column is sortable realtime sorted and all rowscolumns are editable. As an example, lets assume the entire table represents an order. Each row in the table, represents order lines, and the columns represents properties of the order line, like product, quantity, price etc. The user can add, remove and edit rows order lines as he wish.p  pTo make the UI less confusing for the user, I would like to use row selection, and also make sure that only a single row is editable at a time because sorting would otherwise make the currently edited value jump around in the table. I also have validation per order line, which is easier to visualize for a row, rather than individual columns as an example, assume the combination or product X and the quantity 7 is illegal, as product X can only be ordered in units of 5, I want to highlight both X and the value 7.p  pRow selection can easily be enabled. But strongis there a good way to implement row editingstrong The defaultbuilt in editing mode in a codeTableViewcode is more like that of Excel where each column may be edited, committed and validated individually, and this is not what I want. I want something like the file list in a file explorer. It is important that all edits for the edited row are committed to the backing model codeitemscode property of the codeTableViewcode at once ie. no codeonEditCommitcode for individual columns because of the sorting and validation.p  pIve implemented something similar before in Swing, and then ended up using what I named a codeColumnListcode, which is really a codeListcode, but with column headers and columns, to make it appear just like a table. Would this be a viable choice in JavaFX too The codeTableColumcode class seems very bound to a codeTableViewcode, but I might be missing something.p  pI also am aware of the Address book example in the JavaFX tutorials, which has row selection and editor fields below the table. This is what I have currently implemented in my application, but I want the editing to appear inline with the currently selected row. So, making the editors appear on top or inside the currently selected row would also be an alternative, if anyone can come up with a way to achieve that.p

Negative 1995 pWe are facing a performance issue while serialising file by multiple processes. p  pHere is the issue We are creating multiple processes in distributed computing env to do our calculation and then write down output of each processes in a file. Main process use these files, merge it in memory and do the further calculation. p  pWe have limited no of servers. What happens is 23 processes can be created in same server. When this happens 23 processes created in same server, we are having a scenario when those processes try to writeserialize computed file file size is approx 8090 MB on the disk at the same time. When this happens, it takes around 3m to serialise the file. In normal case, that 8090 MB takes only 30s. p  pWe monitored this scenario in performance monitor and our log timings and could see because of 23 processes trying to write at the same time, it takes around 6 times longer than normal timing. p  pAny suggestion to improve timings of 3mins scenario is appreciated.p  pWe use .Net framework and code is written in c.p

Negative 1995 pIm learning Qt and using it as addin to VS 2013. My problem occurs while using Qt Designer in context menu to any object, I cant find the go to slot option, as it is described in a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt5gettingstartedqt.html relnofollowGetting Started Tutoriala. Im pretty sure, that its a matter of using vs2013 addin. My question is is there any way to fix this bug Or I just have to add any slots manualy p  pI have found some similar issues a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12227993qtdesignermissinggotoslotincontextmenuherea and a hrefhttparroyjose.blogspot.com201306addingcustomslotinqtdesignerand.html relnofollowherea, but these are quite old articles 1 and 2 year old, so I suppose that something has changed since then...p
Negative 1995 pI am creating a quiz using jQuery. I have established the quiz questions and answers in a 2dimensional array. I have the answer choices 15 displayed in a separate array. I have stored the answer choices to temporary variables and want to display them next to radio buttons. The answer choices noted in my code as answerAanswerChoices[j][0], etc are being input correctly but they are not displaying.

Negative 1995 pWe have a reasonably large interdependent multiproject code base currently using Java7 amp Groovy built with EclipseWTP amp Ant running Tomcat 7. Basically something what you would find in probably most Java Enterprise software development. We have tweaked our build process over the years but it is rather fragile within Eclipse, the Antonly build works perfectly, though slowlyp  ul liworkspace ul lijarsli licommonli licommonweb depends sourceli liweb1 depends commonweb,commonli liweb2 depends commonweb,commonli liweb3 depends commonweb,commonli licliapp1 depends commonli licliapp2 depends commonli ulli ul  pWe used to build exclusively with Ant, creating common.jar, commonweb.jar etc and copy into webNWebContentWEBINFlib. This worked but was slow and makes hot code replacement and incremental compile impossible at least for changes in common.p  pNow, we let EclipseWTP compile and assemble static resources. Common and commonweb projects are added in Deployment Assembly as virtual jars, to prevent the time spent creating the jars. Ant still does some templating and copying of dynamic resources as well as copying all external jars into WEBINFlib This is done by Ant as compared to EclipseWeb App Libraries so we only have to maintain our list of jars in one place, build.xml, rather that having to maintain them separately for every project in Eclipse in addition to build.xml for production builds. After Ant is done, it automatically refreshes the WEBINFlib and WEBINFclasses folders so the EclipseWTP is aware of the updated files.p  pFor production deploys on the server we simply let Ant handle both the compiling and the assembling.p  pOur strategy of letting EclipseWTP deal with automatic incremental building and publishing to Tomcat for development, has reduced the Antonly compile time of 2 min to virtually instantaneous and allowing hot code replacement of common classes. However this setup is very fragile as any file change on the file system without Eclipse knowledge breaks the build. This also means than our project setup is complicated and thus needs to be checked in, which of course means it breaks frequently as colleagues accidentally check in local changes.p  pstrongThere has to be a better way to make flat multi module project work seamlessly in an IDEstrongp  pI have looked into maven and gradle but both admit that when it comes to flat multimodule setups they just dont work or do they. Nesting is not possible due to multiple top level projects requiring the same submodules. Yes you can place the root pom.xml or gradle.settings in the folder above the projects, but that doesnt allow for seamless buildingdependency management by Intellij or Eclipse as this folder isnt visible.p  pUnfortunately all tutorials and examples I have come across deal with hobbyproject size setups. Never a true enterprise example with several earwar and shared projects. p  pWe are happy to change build tools or even IDE, should there be a tool chain that can actually deals with seamlessly compiling and assembling without having to leave the IDE and thats fast. p  pBasically, what we are after is simplyp  ul liAutomatic Dependency Managementli liFast, incremental compile during developmentli liHotCode replacement WTPJRebel Styleli ul  pSO, can you helpp

Negative 1995 pI am attempting to make a grouped bar chart...with a few modifications.p  pI have four columns for my chart Quarter, Person, Percentage, Total Percentage.

First, I would like to space out the xaxis. There are four bars per person and I was wondering how I could make it so that there is more space in between each person. Ive run into trouble with this because the X axis doesnt contain any numbers of any sort. Does anyone know how to do thisp  pSecond, I would like to add a vertical line for each person representing their total percentage. This way, it would be easy for the viewer to see which quarter the person performed under their yearly average and which quarter they overperformed. I have had a little success with this usingp  precodegeompointdatapoint3, aesxPerson, yTotal Percentage codepre  pat the end of the previous code, but this simply adds a dot between the second and third bars the middle. I made a a hrefhttpi.imgur.comOPamqH5.png relnofollowmock up of this using a grouped bar charta I found via Google. This one only has 3 bars, but perhaps you can get the idea. Some of the problems I ran into this time were, although they are on the same scale, the yaxis for the bar charts is Performance while the yaxis for the line is Total Performance. R did not seem to like this. Also, the whole xaxis not being numeric.p  pI used ggplot2 because I didnt know what else to use, but if you know of any techniquepackage to make this work, I am happy to change that. I am also aware I may need to reshape my data, that is cool, too. p  pThanks so much.p

Negative 1995 pIm working on writing an attached behavior to duplicate column and row expansion across two codeXamPivotGridcodes which have different data sources.p  pThe behavior works, but at any hierarchy level other than the outermost, all rows expand simultaneously. Id like to filter my query for header rows to only get a header with the same parent. Herein lies the problemp  pMy initial pivot grid has four measures, one row, and one column. Only one measure is selected by default. To create a hierarchy, I using the codeXamPivotDataSelectorcode control drag the column to also act as a row, which makes the measure act as the column. While this appears to be a hierarchy on the pivot grid, in actuality one is still one of the grids RowHeaders and the other a ColumnHeader  they share no relationship I can access.p  pAfter searching online, I havent found any information on how I might go about accessing whatever it is that can be used to identify a particular header. I realize that this question may require sufficiently deep knowledge of the codeXamPivotGridcode control that I may never get an answer, so I will continue poring over the grid in the hopes that I may be able to answer this question myself.p  pThank you for your time.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I have found that the columns do indeed become rows rather than columns, so at least that much makes more sense, but they are simply in a list, rather than being hierarchically arranged.p

Negative 1995 pI have an odd problem Ive got an AJAX file uploader fineuploader, as it happens, with a serverside script PHP that handles the upload. Although the uploader has an allowedExtensions setting, I want the allowed extensions to be specified on the server side, so my upload handler checks the file extension and returns an error response if the files extension is not allowed.p  pThe problem Im having is that strikewhereas in my dev environment the upload handler returns this response straight away as expected and the upload stops, on another server the upload goes ahead andstrike the response is only returned emafterem the upload has completed. Which potentially means a very long wait before receiving an error message.p  pstrikeLooking at the network info in developer tools, it seems the browser is waiting for a response the whole time, and on the problematic server only receives it after the upload has completed, which seems to suggest that on the server the upload handler script is actually not being executed until after all the data has been received.strikep  pIt seems to me that the most likely culprit is some setting to do with how PHP handles uploads  multipart form data, but I cant figure out what that might be. Would be grateful for any advicep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIt seems the problem is the same on both servers I just didnt notice the lag on one. So it seems my upload handler script is not executing until the file transfer has completed this seems likely because the script checks the filename early on and throws an Exception if the extension is wrong, so it should respond quickly once its started. Also, it always responds almost immediately when the upload has completed  however long that takes  suggesting thats when its being executed.p  pIs this just a feature of how PHP handles multipart form data Is there any way of allowing the script to respond immediately if the filename is unsuitablep
Negative 1995 pI am unable to resize a RemoteWebDrivers window size to a width greater than around 1040 pixels.

Negative 1995 pI wrote a class to dynamically display EditTexts as you need them. So in any case where an interface needs a variable amount of inputs for strings the class generates the needed EditTexts. It does this by supplying an extra blank EditText at all times. It also removes those that are not used. Any editText that loses focus that is blank is destroyed unless it is the last remaining EditText.p  pIt works pretty well except for the fact that leaving a blank EditText and making it lose focus removes it but also sets the focus to the first EditText on the page which isnt dynamic its part of the pages XML as well as whatever other field I clicked on. So I have two cursors and can no longer edit the first field on the page.p  pI think whats happening is when the EditText loses focus and is destroyed android is setting focus to the default field on the page and then when the next field gains focus that gets a cursor too. Its something to do with the removal of the EditText I believe.p  pI really like this functionality though so I would like to get it working.

Negative 1995 pNew to django so bare with me here  I am trying to deserialize and save an object from some JSON.  Ive got a couple object that looks like thisp  precodeclass Itemmodels.Model    createdat  models.DateTimeFielddefaultutcnow   category  models.ForeignKeyCategory, relatednameitems   class Categorymodels.Model    name  models.CharFieldmaxlength140, uniqueTrue   description  models.TextFielddefault, blankTrue   createdat  models.DateTimeFielddefaultutcnow codepre  pNow, I define serializers for these objects like thisp  precodeclass CategorySerializerserializers.ModelSerializer    class Meta     model  EventCategory     fields         id,       name,       description        class ItemSerializerserializers.ModelSerializer   createdat  serializers.DateTimeField   category  CategorySerializer    class Meta     model  Event     fields         id,       createdat,       category,      codepre  pWhat is a little funky about this data structuring is that the Category objects need not be altered, and I dont want to create any new ones  Ive predefined a bunch of these objects and they essentially express the type of item we are dealing with. We wont be saving, updating, or adding new ones.p  pOK, now lets say I have a JSON representation of an Item that looks like thisp  precodecategory id 1, name somename, description somedescription, id 101, createdat dateinfo codepre  pI would like create and save the Item object, but do not want to create a new category object. If I do thisp  precodeserializer  ItemSerializerdatadata if serializer.isvalid      serializer.save codepre  pIt complains that I am violating the uniqueTrue constraint on the categorys name field. I am assuming that the serializer is propagating the save operation to the category as well. My question how can I define my serializers so that I can read out the category JSON when serializing, but so that I do not get this error when I am deserializingp  pThanks p

Negative 1995 pI came across a segmented implementation of sieve of Eratosthenes which promises to run many times faster than the conventional version.  Can someone please explain how segmentation improves the running time Note that I want to find prime numbers in strong[1,b]strong.p  pIt works on this idea for finding prime numbers till 109p  blockquote   ul   lipWe first generate the sieving primes below sqrt109 which are needed to crossoff multiples. Then we start crossingoff the multiples of the first prime 2 until we reach a multiple of 2  segmentsize, if this happens we calculate the index of that multiple in the next segment using multiple  segmentsize and store it in a separate array next[]. We then crossoff the multiples of the next sieving primes using the same procedure. Once we have crossedoff the multiples of all sieving primes in the first segment we iterate over the sieve array and print out or count the primes.pli   lipIn order to sieve the next segment we reset the sieve array and we increment the lower offset by segmentsize. Then we start crossingoff multiples again, for each sieving prime we retrieve the sieve index from the next array and we start crossingoff multiples from there on...pli   ul blockquote

Negative 1995 pfirst off Ill start with a little bit of background on what I am doing. My professor has tasked me with learning Fortran 90 and the first lesson is to plot the probability density function of the radial Sturmian functions. In case you are interested, the radial Sturmian functions are used to graph the momentum space eigenfunctions for the hydrogen atom. Pretty tough for a first lesson, wouldnt you say p  pIn order to produce these radial functions, one needs to first produce some polynomials called the Gegenbauer polynomials, denotedp  pCsubbsubsupasupx,p  pwhere a and b should be stacked atop each other. One needs these polynomials because the Sturmians lets call them Rn,l are defined like so,p  pRn,lp  N  suppsuplsupsupfraslsubpsup2sup  ksup2supsupl2supsub   Csubn  l  1subsupl  1supsuppsup2sup  ksup2supsupfraslsubpsup2sup  ksup2supsub,p  pwhere N is a normalisation constant, p is the momentum, n is the principle quantum number, l is the angular momentum and k is a constant. The normalisation constant is there so that when I come to square this function, it will produce a probability distribution for the momentum of the electron in a hydrogen atom. p  pGegenbauer polynomials are generated using the following recurrence relationp  pCsubnsubsuplsupx   sup1supfraslsubnsub[2l  n  1 x Csubn  1subsuplsupx  2l  n  2Csubn  2subsuplsupx],p  pwith Csub0subsuplsupx  1 and Csub1subsuplsupx  2lx, as you may have noticed, l is fixed but n is not. At the start of my program, I will specify both l and n and work out the Gegenbauer polynomial I need for the radial function I wish to plot.p  pThe problems I am having with my code at the moment are all in my subroutine for working out the value of the Gegenbauer polynomial Csubnl1subsupl1supsuppsup2sup  ksup2supsupfraslsubpsup2sup  ksup2supsub for incremental values of p between 0 and 3.

Negative 1995 pI switched from making sequential HTTP calls to 4 REST services, to making 4 simultaneous calls using a commonj4 work manager task executor.  Im using WebLogic 12c.  This new code works on my development environment, but in our test environment under load conditions, and occasionally while not under load, the results map is not populated with all of the results.  The logging suggests that each work item did receive back the results though.  Could this be a problem with the ConcurrentHashMap  In this example from IBM, they use their own version of Work and theres a getData method, although it doesnt like that method really exists in their class definition.  I had followed a different example that just used the Work class but didnt demonstrate how to get the data out of those threads into the main thread. Should I be using execute instead of schedule  The API doesnt appear to be well documented.  The stuckthreadtimeout is sufficiently high. component.processInbound actually contains the code for the HTTP call, but I the problem isnt there because I can switch back to the synchronous version of the class below and not have any issues.p  pa hrefhttppublib.boulder.ibm.cominfocenterwsdoc400v6r0index.jsptopiccom.ibm.websphere.iseries.docinfoaeasyncbnsconceptscasbworkmgr.html relnofollowhttppublib.boulder.ibm.cominfocenterwsdoc400v6r0index.jsptopiccom.ibm.websphere.iseries.docinfoaeasyncbnsconceptscasbworkmgr.htmla p  pMy codep  precodepublic class WorkManagerAsyncLinkedComponentRouter implements         MessageDispatcherltObject, Objectgt       private ListltComponentltObject, Objectgtgt components     protected ConcurrentHashMapltString, Objectgt workItemsResultsMap     protected ConcurrentHashMapltString, Exceptiongt componentExceptionsInThreads ...      components is populated at this point with one component for each REST call to be made.     public Object routefinal Object message throws RouterException      ...         try              workItemsResultsMap  new ConcurrentHashMapltString, Objectgt             componentExceptionsInThreads  new ConcurrentHashMapltString, Exceptiongt             final String parentThreadID  Thread.currentThread.getName              ListltWorkItemgt producerWorkItems  new ArrayListltWorkItemgt             for final ComponentltObject, Objectgt component  this.components                  producerWorkItems.addworkManagerTaskExecutor.schedulenew Work                      public void run                          ExecuteThread th  ExecuteThread Thread.currentThread                         th.setNamecomponent.getName                         LOG.infoChild thread   Thread.currentThread.getName   Parent thread   parentThreadID   Executing work item for   component.getName                         try                              Object returnObj  component.processInboundmessage                             if returnObj  null                                 LOG.infoObject returned to work item is null, not adding to producer components results map, for this producer                                           component.getName                             else                                  LOG.infoAdded producer component thread result for                                           component.getName                                 workItemsResultsMap.putcomponent.getName, returnObj                                                          LOG.infoFinished executing work item for   component.getName                          catch Exception e                              componentExceptionsInThreads.putcomponent.getName, e                                               ...                                end loop over producer components               Block until all items are done             workManagerTaskExecutor.waitForAllproducerWorkItems, stuckThreadTimeout              LOG.infoFinished waiting for all producer component threads.             if componentExceptionsInThreads  null                     ampamp componentExceptionsInThreads.size gt 0                  ...

Negative 1995 pI am studying for the Spring Core certification and I am unclear about how to configure strongSpring Securitystrong project into an application.p  pIn the course documentation I found these 2 code snippetsp  p1 strongConfiguration in web.xmlstrong p  precodeltfiltergt     ltfilternamegtspringSecurityFilterChainltfilternamegt     ltfilterclassgt         org.springframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy     ltfilterclassgt ltfiltergt  ltfiltermappinggt     ltfilternamegtspringSecurityFilterChainltfilternamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt ltfiltermappinggt codepre  pI am pretty new to Java EE and also to Spring, so reading online I understand that this strongfilterstrong is something like a strongServletstrong that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource a servlet or static content, or on the response from a resource, or both. So if the standard strongServletstrong are objects used to handle request, create content and give a response for example the HttpServlet that handle HttpRequest, and give an HttpResponse containing the view to show the strongFilterstrong doesnt create content but elaborate resources.p  pSo, strongFiltersstrong are Java classes that can be used in Servlet Programming for the following purposesp  ul listrongTo intercept requests from a client before they access a resource at back endstrongli listrongTo manipulate responses from server before they are sent back to the clientstrongli ul  pand there exists various types of filters suggested by the specifications as the strongAuthentication Filtersstrong is this the type used for Spring Security for this taskp  pSo what exactly do the filter declared and mapped into the previous snippet do I think that it applies the strongspringSecurityFilterChainstrong to all the requests directed towards the strongstrong URL pattern that I think it means to all the servlet eventually declared that handle request.p  pOk, but what exactly is this strongspringSecurityFilterChainstrong . Looking here a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringsecuritysitedocs3.0.xreferencesecurityfilterchain.html relnofollowhttpdocs.spring.iospringsecuritysitedocs3.0.xreferencesecurityfilterchain.htmlap  pIt seems to me that Spring doesnt use a single filter, but that this strongspringSecurityFilterChainstrong maintains a filter chain internally so it uses more filters where each of the filters has a particular responsibility and filters are added or removed from the configuration depending on which services are required.p  pBut where exactly are these filter declaredp  p2 The second code snippet showed in the course slides is this one and I cant understand if it is relatedlinked to the previous one or notp  precodeltbeansgt     ltsecurityhttpgt         ltsecurityintercepturl patternaccountsedit accessROLEADMIN gt         ltsecurityintercepturl patternaccountsaccount accessROLEADMIN,ROLEUSER gt         ltsecurityintercepturl patternaccounts accessISAUTHENTICATEDFULLY gt         ltsecurityintercepturl patterncustomers accessISAUTHENTICATEDANONYMOUSLY gt     ltsecurityhttpgt ltbeansgt codepre  pI understand that it intercepts urls and that these intercepted URLs are evaluated in the order listed first match is used, put specific matches first.p  pSo for example if the URL match with strongaccountseditstrong pattern it is applied the strongROLEADMINstrong access level. But what exactly is this Is this something that I have to write or is it something provided by Spring frameworkp  pThe other doubts are where are this second code snipped declared Into the XML Spring configuration file How is it related if a relationship exists with the first code snippetp  pTnxp

Negative 1995 pOkay so I finally finished my assignment and had been testing it by creating objects using right click New Account etc, this has all been working fine and from what I can see the Superclasses and Subclasses are all linked correctly, however my work is tested using a test class called HW2 which when I run this is supposed to create some accounts and print their details to the terminal. However the output is missing loads of stuff compared to what it is supposed to look like, basically I want to know why the test script is not creating the objects correctly.

Negative 1995 pId like to do something very much like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3796025fillsvgpathelementwithabackgroundimageFill SVG path element with a backgroundimagea except that the solution offered there will tile the image to fill the the entire background area.  I dont want that.  If the image doesnt fill either the entire height or the entire width, then Id just like it to center within the path shape and let that be that.  If I try to restrict the behavior by changing the heightwidth attributes, then the rendering just scales the image until it fills at least one of the dimensions.  p  pI guess this behavior somewhat makes sense since it uses patterns.  I can see that what I want is not really a pattern per se.  I just want to slap an image in the middle of my shape just as it is, not make a pattern out of it.  However, I do want the shape boundaries defined by my SVG path to cut off the rendering of the image, whenever the images size extends past those boundaries.  I dont know else to get that behavior besides the use of a pattern for the fill attribute, as is done in the answer to that question.p  pIn a similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11496734addabackgroundimagepngtoasvgcircleshapeAdd a background image .png to a SVG circle shapea , the user at the very bottom seems to indicate that he used a filter rather than a pattern to achieve what Im seeking to achieve.  However, when I try that, no regard is paid to the actual shape during rendering.  The image is rendered without any regard to the shape boundaries, which seems pretty much useless.p  pIs there any way in SVG to get that patternlike background image behavior but without actually tiling the image into a patternp

Negative 1995 pIm developing a large project in C with other team members and we have a disagreement on how this can never happen style of errors should be handled. By this I mean error cases that the code currently can never reach, but somebody can modify the code and after the modification it is possible the error case will be reached.p  pFor example, lets say I have a function that returns either 0 on success or EINVAL if its given a NULL argument. What I naturally do isp  precodeint err struct myctx ctx err  callFunctionampctx if err  0    abort  codepre  por evenp  precodeint err struct myctx ctx err  callFunctionampctx if err  EINVAL    abort  else if err  0    abort  codepre  p...to distinguish between the two cases of EINVAL and unknown error code.p  pThe benefits of this error handling approach are that it is simple to program few lines of code and leaves behind a core file that can be used to quickly debug the situation.p  pHowever, some team members disagree with this error handling approach because Im doing an unclean exit and while the code currently can never reach the abort line it is possible that in the future somebody modifies the code and it reaches the abort line then. According to them, I should try to do a controlled exit and print the reason to the user. So, I guess instead of this I should dop  precodeint err struct myctx ctx err  callFunctionampctx if err  EINVAL    fprintfstderr, Argument was NULL in file s line dn, FILE, LINE   exit1  else if err  0    fprintfstderr, Error was d in file s line dn, err, FILE, LINE   exit1  codepre  pIn my opinion, this second error handling strategy is worse because it does not leave behind a core file that can be used to debug this situation. Furthermore, it results in code that has more lines of code.p  pSo, the question is, how should this can never happen style of errors be handled in C Should I do an abort or a controlled exit with a descriptive error messagep

Negative 1995 pI have an application that aims to behave like the instagram app. This meansp  pWhen the user opens the app, latest content from the local database is displayed, but a request is fired to get the servers latest content. If the server returns such data, the local database gets populated with it and then the UI displays it.p  pSo, how can I handle the gap that this can create between the records that already existed, and the newer ones Lets say I get 10 items per page from my API, and there are 15 new ones. When the request returns, the latest 10 items get inserted in my local database this leaving a gap of 5 items with the ones that were already there. This could even happen several times if the user doesnt use the app a lot, and the gap could just be huge if they havent used it in a while, so just firing a lot of request doesnt seem to be the solution.p  pAnd the second thing is stale data. Items that have been updated or deleted on the server. I can provide an endpoint to retrieve changes, and softdelete records so they can still be get but with a deleted flag. But the question is when and how should I request that It doesnt simply belong in to the Enter the app  request latest items flow. Should I just poll regularly, use some sort of notifications maybe Then what if the user is offlinep  pIm puzzled and Ive been googling A LOT lately, and I havent found a convincing solution. They all are SyncAdapter style stuff.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1995 pI have a directive in Angularjs that will have a table with lots of rowsover 1000, so my boss said that i shouldnt use binding to make the grids contentbecause of angulars 2000 limit in binding and instead i should create the dom elements on the fly.p  pAnd i did that with codeangular.element...code, and it works. BUT now i am thinking if there could be a performance boost if i use the native js codedocument.createElementcodep  pSo is jqlite slower than pure js how much impact would it make when making over 1000 rows of html p  pis jquery fasterslower or equal to jqlitep  pUPDATE p  pJoe Enzminger 1 for one time binding it would be good for reportprint view witch is just for view. BUT the grid has inline editing so it needs the twoway bindings. it has 19 columns each with a input and 2 buttons and a save button at the last column. each button has codengshowcode and the save button has codengclasscode to change its icon based on the rows status. so 1931 two way bindings.p  pthis grid is a data entry form of some kine D and all rows should be visible and cannot have pagination.p  pUPDATE2p  pI forgot to mention that right now i have a empty codetbodycode element in my template and all its content is generated as a simple dom and injected into it with absolutely no data bindings of any kind. all the interactions are handled with good all fashion JS manually D.p

What Im failing to understand is strongwhystrong the codeDisposecode method gets called in the first place.p  pConsider the code verbatim from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7423841howdoiremoveeventhandlerswhenimfinishedwithaviewandviewmodelbutthis exampleap  precodepublic class DetailViewModel  IDisposable      public DetailViewModelMyDetailModel detailModel               Retain the Detail Model         this.model  detailModel           Handle changes to the Model not coming from this ViewModel         this.model.PropertyChanged  modelPropertyChanged   Potential leak           public void Dispose              this.model.PropertyChanged  modelPropertyChanged       codepre  pSo supposing that this model is referenced by the codeDataContextcode of some window, then it emshouldem have no references when that window is closed and garbage collected. But the event codedetailModel.PropertyChangedcode will still hold a reference to the delegate which is why were unsubscribing in the first place. And each delegate is implemented as a compilergenerated class which will hold a reference to the instance the codeDetailViewModelcode in its autogenerated codetargetcode field.p  pSo does codetargetcode not count as a reference to the codeDetailViewModelcodep  pI see two cases.p  ol liIt does count, and the codeDetailViewModelcode lives as long as the event its subscribing to does, and codeDisposecode wont benefit anything since it wont be called until after the subscribed object gets garbage collected.li liIt doesnt count, and then the codeDetailViewModelcode gets disposed of which would call the event removal code. Ok, no more space leak. But if you dont implement codeIDisposablecode, and the event gets fired and tries to call your delegate, which now points to a deleted object, why doesnt the program crash Does the CLR just swallow the exceptionli ol  pIve only been coding C for about a month, so if Im really fundamentally misunderstanding something, please let me know.p

Negative 1995 pIm taking a C course and Im stuck on classes and objects. Im working on an assignment that, in a nutshell, creates a class that takes two variables lets say length and width.p  pIve figured out how to do this using get and set functions. But then, we have to use math on these variables. Were supposed to write a function that takes one instance of the class as a parameter so two variables, and then does math on both this object the one taken as a parameter and object that the method of was called.p  pPart of why Im confused is the language, and Im not sure exactly what that means. So far, like I said, I managed to be able to end up with setLength and setWidth variables set via user input.  I am really, really stuck on trying to then pass these values or this object to a function and then call the method of another objectp  pMaybe if someone could help me figure out what taking an object as a parameter and then doing math on the object i called the method of means  Or just help with passing objectsp

Negative 1995 pI am developing an R package for which I wrote some test files using R package codetestthatcodeand placed the files under codetestscode folder. I ran codeR CMD buildcode on a Linux machine with R version 3.0.0. The command failed because codetestthatcode package requires R version at least 3.1.0.p  pTwo following things I can do, but I am not sure which is better.p  ol lipI can remove whole things in codetestscode folder, so that my R package will also work for R version less than 3.1.0. As I notice, test files are not required for building an R package. Those are only useful for the developer.pli lipI can keep all test files, but explicitly mention codeDepends R gt 3.1.0code in the codeDESCRIPTIONcode file. The downside is that 1 the package will be available to less users and 2 more important, it depends on codetestthatcode package. Whatever updates there might affect my package potentially.pli ol  pWhich one do you think is betterp  pstrong[update]strongp  pI followed the suggestion from  hrbrmstr, which is, I first built the package using R 3.1.0, and then check it on a Linux machine with R 3.0.0. But I still failed. The log is as follows.p  precode checking package namespace information ... OK  checking package dependencies ...

Negative 1995 pI have been developing automated tests to my app, however, we reached a point where we have to change options outside the app environment. To do so we decided to use the latest UIAutomator v2. By doing so we are able to use espresso testing inside our app and UI Automator for system popups or change settings in the same test.  The issue at this point is that we have to maintain min SDK 16 for contract purposes. This makes it impossible to use UIAutomator v2. The compiler itself suggests a solution p  precodeSuggestion use toolsoverrideLibraryandroid.support.test.uiautomator.v18 to force usage codepre  pMy current gradle relevant gradle configp  precode compileSdkVersion rootProject.ext.compileSdkVersion  buildToolsVersion rootProject.ext.buildToolsVersion    default apk name to be overriden  project.archivesBaseName  AwessomeApp   android.enforceUniquePackageNamefalse   defaultConfig          String charPrefix  AWS         minSdkVersion rootProject.ext.minSdkVersion         targetSdkVersion rootProject.ext.targetSdkVersion         versionCode appVersion.getCode         versionName appVersion.getName         applicationId pt.company.awesome         testApplicationId pt.company.test         testInstrumentationRunner android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner      codepre  pHowever, it doesnt work, probably because we have the minSdk set by the root project using gradle.
