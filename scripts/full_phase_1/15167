Positive 15167 pMy ContactInfo class contains all nullable properties and corresponding database fields, aside from the primary key. ContactInfo is a property on another class, OrgInfo, and in the OrgInfo mapping I have ContactInfo set to Cascade.SaveUpdate. In my application, OrgInfo is often saved with a null ContactInfo. As a result, NHibernate is inserting a ton of rows in my contactinfo table with all the fields null except for the primary key.p  pMy question is how do I stop NHibernate from inserting these rows and only save when there is at least one property in ContactInfo that is not null Im hoping there is a way to do this in the mapping and not with conditional logic and a separate save for ContactInfo.p  pThanks in advancep  pHere is my ContactInfo mapp  precodepublic class ContactInfoMap  ClassMapltContactInfogt      public ContactInfoMap          Tablecontactinfo         LazyLoad         Idx gt x.ContactInfoId.GeneratedBy.Identity.Columncontactinfoid         Mapx gt x.FirstName.Columnfirstname         Mapx gt x.LastName.Columnlastname         Mapx gt x.NickName.Columnnickname         Mapx gt x.AddressStreet1.Columnaddressstreet1          ... more nullable properties        codepre  pAnd my OrgInfo mapp  precodepublic class OrgInfoMap  ClassMapltOrgInfogt      public OrgInfoMap          Tableorginfo         LazyLoad         Idx gt x.OrgInfoId.GeneratedBy.Identity.Columnorginfoid         Referencesx gt x.ContactInfo.Columncontactinfoid.Cascade.SaveUpdate.Not.LazyLoad         Mapx gt x.OrgName.Columnorgname          ... etc.       codepre

Positive 15167 pIm wanting to use extension methods for adding features to the domain model, to only have one aggregate root for retrieving associated entities, like thisp  precodepublic class User      public ICollectionltInvoicegt Invoices get set  codepre  pIts populated in an injectable interfacep  precodepublic interface ICurrentUserService      public User GetCurrentUser  codepre  pAnd then, for example in a controller not really in my case, this is a quick sample for SO, controllers still use services, I would want to do thisp  pcodevar invoice  currentUserService.GetCurrentUser.Invoices.Specificid  var mapped  mappingEngine.MapltInvoiceModelgtinvoice  return Viewmapped codep  pcodeSpecificidcode being an extension methodp  precodepublic static Invoice Specificthis ICollectionltInvoicegt invoices, Guid id      return invoices.SingleOrDefaulti gt i.Id  id  codepre  pThis sort of approach however causes several issues, the most concerning being that on the first access of the collection, even if all you do is a codeLINQcode operation that doesnt enumerate the items, the entire list of children is loaded unless codeExtraLazycode is specified and youre only doing a codeCountcode. What I would like to happen, is for the proxy to remain a proxy until it actually has to get the final itemcollection as some extension methods alike this would involve returning a collection.p  pWhat Id like to happen, is until codeSingleOrDefaultcode gets called in the extension method, the database wouldnt be queried, and when it does get queried, the query would be in style of codewhere InvoiceId   and UserId  code, rather than the where being done in memory after the whole collection is loaded.p  pIs this doable in fluent codeNHibernatecode or am I trying to achieve a pipe dream Im simply trying out an approach with this project here, to give the domain model a really fluent syntax.p

These new types may or may not have the same structure as ActiveInvoices. I have tried to use dynamic but thought of asking experts around here if they have any better ideas to implement the required functionality  in most optimized generic manner. p  pRegrets for being very detailed and lengthy in asking but i thought to include as many details as i can.

According to those articles, NHibernate is supposed to be smart enough to determine what subclass to instantiate when I query for a particular subclass.  But, when I execute the following statementp  precodevar result  Session.QueryOverltBusinessUnitgt                     .Wherex gt x.Code  Acme                     .SingleOrDefault codepre  pan exception is thrown because it cant create an instance of the abstract BusinessUnit class.  The only way I can get this to work is to specify Company as the type argument for QueryOver.p  pIve confirmed that using a discriminator breaks since NHibernate is looking for all of the columns to exist in a single table.  Without it, though, I struggle to see how NHibernate would know what type to instantiate.p  pWhat am I doing wrong  Is the problem in my mappings, the way Im querying, ...p  pstrongQuestion 2strong When I change the query to something like thisp  precodepublic T WithCodeltTgtString code     where T  BusinessUnit      var result  Session.QueryOverltTgt                         .Wherex gt x.Code  code                         .SingleOrDefault      return result  codepre  pI get an exception indicating that the UPDATE statement conflicts with a foreign key constraint.

Positive 15167 pI need to map one entity to two tables table x and table y. Its not up to me to merge the two database tables in one and add a discriminating column to differentiate them.p  pThe two tables have the exact same structure, but, names of these two tables in database are different.p  pWhat should be done p
Positive 15167 pIn our application we have base classes for entities like thisp  precodepublic abstract class Entity  IEntity      public virtual int Id  get set      public virtual byte[] Version  get set    public abstract class EntityWithValidity  Entity, ICloneable      [Required]     public virtual string LogicalId  get set       [Required]     public virtual DateTime ValidFrom  get set       public virtual DateTime ValidTo  get set   codepre  pSo, we like to implement a logic for the entities that entities can have validities in the past or in the future, based on the ValidFrom and ValidTo fields. The logical entity is identified by the LogicalId, but its properties and relationships can change over time, and we want to keep track of those changes.p  pSo, we have two concrete entities, EntityA and EntityB, both inheriting from EntityWithValidity.p  precodepublic class EntityA  EntityWithValidity      private IListltEntityBgt bs      public EntityA              this.bs  new ListltEntityBgt           public virtual IReadOnlyListltEntityBgt Bs              get  return this.bs.ToList.AsReadOnly          set  this.bs  new ListltEntityBgtvalue        codepre  pAnd EntityB exactly symmetrically.p  pFor mappings, we use Fluent NHibernate with automappings. And we have some overrides like thisp  precode    public void OverrideAutoMappingltEntityAgt mapping              mapping.HasManyToManyx gt x.Bs             .Inverse             .PropertyRefLogicalId             .Access.CamelCaseFieldPrefix.None      codepre  pAndp  precode    public void OverrideAutoMappingltEntityBgt mapping              mapping.HasManyToManyx gt x.As             .ChildPropertyRefLogicalId             .Access.CamelCaseFieldPrefix.None      codepre  pFor simple scenarios, our entities and mappings are working exactly like we want them to. The mappings seem to work logically the way we want, and we are able to navigate the relationships in code in either direction.p  pstrongThe problemstrong  If we are trying to navigate the strongsamestrong relationship in strongbothstrong directions within the strongsamestrong stateful session, then NHibernate crashes with this kind of stack tracep  precode115558.018 System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException The given key was not present in the dictionary. at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary2.getItemTKey key at NHibernate.Persister.Entity.AbstractEntityPersister.LoadByUniqueKeyString propertyName, Object uniqueKey, ISessionImplementor session at NHibernate.Type.EntityType.LoadByUniqueKeyString entityName, String uniqueKeyPropertyName, Object key, ISessionImplementor session codepre  pAt some point I was thinking if the issue we have is related to the issue reported here a hrefhttpsnhibernate.jira.combrowseNH2180 relnofollowNH2180a. At least it has the same stack trace. However, changing the FetchMode doesnt have any effect in our case.p  pWhen going in with debugger to see what happens, I can see that the session contains a PersistenceContext, and in there you have a collection CollectionsByKey. In there I can see that for some loaded collections NHibernate is using the primary key Id as the key, but in other cases it is using the LogicalId as the key. I think this is fundamentally wrong. The LogicalId that we have is NOT unique. Also looking at the stack trace and NHibernate sources, NHibernate is going to a branch where it is assuming that the key we use in the mapping is Unique, but it is not. It is NOT configured as unique, it just seems that this branch is some kind of fall back option when NHibernate cannot figure out any other strategy.p  pSo, any help to the situation Can anybody come up with a mapping that would enable us to do what we are trying to do, and have NHibernate support that in a robust wayp  pThanksp

Id love it if I could access it off of the column name, but the column name SoureColumn is never populated.p  pHow can I reliably access the Salt that exists in cmd.Parameters Or is there a better way I have full control to change whatever is needed, except the NHibernate version.p  pemNote If Im setting the salt somewhere else, it may make sense for me to also hash the value in that place, rather than using a UserType.emp  pNHiberate 2.1.2.4000 Fluent NHibernate 1.1.0.685p

Negative 15167 pWe need a web content accelerator for static images to sit in front of our Apache web front end serversp  pOur previous hosting partner used Tux with great success and I like the fact its part of Red Hat Linux which were using, but its last update was in 2006 and there seems little chance of future development. Our ISP recommends we use Squid in reverse caching proxy role.p  pAny thoughts between Tux and Squid Compatibility, reliability and future support are as important to us as performance.p  pAlso, I read in other threads here about Varnish anyone have any realworld experience of Varnish compared with Squid, andor Tux, gained in hightraffic environmentsp  pCheersp  pIanp  pUPDATE Were testing Squid now. Using ab to pull the same image 10,000 times with a concurrency of 100, both Apache on its own and SquidApache burned through the requests very quickly. But Squid made only a single request to Apache for the image then served them all from RAM, whereas Apache alone had to fork a large number of workers in order to serve the images. It looks like Squid will work well in freeing up the Apache workers to handle dynamic pages.p

Negative 15167 pHi guys  Just wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to test ones data access methods.

Negative 15167 pI have a Perl script I wrote for my own personal use that fetches image files from a website periodically.  It then saves these images to a folder.  These image files are quite often the same from fetch to fetch, and Id like to not save duplicates if I can get around it.p  pMy question What would be the best way to comparecheck if they are the samep  pMy only real thought so far is to open a file handle to existing one, md5 it, md5 the responsecontent from the fetch and then compare them.  Would that workp  pIs there a better wayp  pEDITp  pWow, already tons of great suggestions.  Does it help if I tell you that this script runs daily via cron I.e. it is guaranteed to always run at the exact same time everyday Also Im looking at the lastmodified headers on some of these, and they dont look 100 accurate, i.e. there are some that have a lastmodified of over a week ago when I know the image is more recent than that.  Im assuming thats because the image file itself hasnt been modified on the server since then... which doesnt help me much...p

Negative 15167 pIve been looking through the MSDN trying to understand the crytoapi.  Below are some questions and guesses as to how things might work. Any answers or confirmations or refuting of my surmises much appreciated.p  pAccording to the note I found at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms867086.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms867086.aspxa, the CSP keeps public private key pairs between sessions. p  precode Does that mean they are kept indefinitely If so, whatever signature or exchange key pairs are extant when the CSP is closed remain.   Of what value are these containers and any key pairs they contain  I guess they could be used to sign things without obtaining a handle to a key pair.   Is there any way to get a handle to one of the key pairs codepre  pIt looks to me as if a key container can containp  precode 1 signature key pair  1 key exchange key pair  any number of PUBLIC keys of either signature or keyexchange type  any number of session keys codepre  pIs this correct  Are the non paired keys destroyed when the container is closedp  pWhat is the usual method of creatingnaming key containers  How does one keep from stomping on some other applications container   I need a container with publicprivate keys so the temporary container mentioned in the remarks section of cryptacquirecontext  isnt applicable. Maybe use create name consisting of some fixed portion plus a sequence number.  Could delete container when done.p  pcryptsignhash specifies that either the signature or key exchange private key is to be used to sign the hash.  I guess this means cryptsignkey will find the private key created by cryptkeygen with the appropriate Algid parmeter values CALGRSAKEYX or CALGRSASIGN.p  pIf I export a key, does the keyblob contain information telling what kind of key it isp  pif I export a PUBLICKEYBLOB and transport it to some other environment.  Do I have to import that blob in the new environment before I can use it to verify a signature  cryptverifysignature needs a handle to the key so it looks like it must be first imported.  Does importing a PUBLICKEYBLOB replace the public key of any extant publicprivate key pair  I assume NOT.p

Negative 15167 pIm a novice in OpenCL.p  pI have an algorithm which uses templates. It worked well with OpenMP parallelization but now the amount of data has grown and the only way to process it is to rewrite it to use OpenCL. I can easily use MPI to build it for cluster but Teslalike GPU  is much cheaper than cluster p  pIs there any way to use C templates in OpenCL kernelp  pIs it possible to somehow expand templates by C compiler or some tool and after that use so changed kernel functionp  pEDIT. The idea of a workaround is to somehow generate C99compatible code from C code from the template.p  pI found a following about Comeaup  pComeau C 4.3.3 is a full and true compiler that performs full syntax checking, full semantic checking, full error checking and all other compiler duties. Input C code is translated into internal compiler trees and symbol tables looking nothing like C or C. As well, it generates an internal proprietary intermediate form. But instead of using a proprietary back end code generator, Comeau C 4.3.3 generates C code as its output. Besides the technical advantages of C, the C generating aspects of products like Comeau C 4.3.3 have been touted as a reason for Cs success since it was able to be brought to a large number of platforms due to the common availability of C compilers.p  pThe C compiler is used merely and only for the sake of obtaining native code generation. This means that Comeau C is tailored for use with specific C compilers on each respective platform. Please note that it is a requirement that tailoring must be done by Comeau. Otherwise, the generated C code is meaningless as it is tied to a specific platform where platform includes at least the CPU, OS, and C compiler and furthermore, the generated C code is not standalone. Therefore, it cannot be used by itself note that this is both a technical and legal requirement when using Comeau C, and this is why there is not normally an option to see the generated C code its almost always unhelpful and the compile process, including its generation, should be considered as internal phases of translation. p

I can solve the problem by making a longer thread.sleep after the waitall.p  pFor the most part it waits to the last thread but I get an error sometimes saying it cant access the progressUpdate function because OperationsComplete has already been run.p  pI get the error at BackgroundWorker1.ReportProgresscompletedCount, ScanResult below but it shouldnt be calling that because WaitAll should wait until the threads are complete.p  precodePrivate Sub ScanIsDoneByVal ar As IAsyncResult     Dim d As PingDelegate  DirectCastar.AsyncState, PingDelegate     Dim ScanResult As ServerInfo  d.EndInvokear      SyncLock lockObject         completedCount  completedCount  1         BackgroundWorker1.ReportProgresscompletedCount, ScanResult     End SyncLock End Sub    Private Sub BackgroundWorker1DoWork ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.ComponentModel.DoWorkEventArgs Handles BackgroundWorker1.DoWork      Dim servers As ListOf ServerInfo  DirectCaste.Argument, ListOf ServerInfo     Dim waitHandles As New ListOf WaitHandle     Dim waitHandles2 As New ListOf WaitHandle     Dim waitHandles3 As New ListOf WaitHandle     Dim waitHandles4 As New ListOf WaitHandle      For Each server As ServerInfo In servers         ThreadsOpen  1         WaitCountAll  1         Dim d As New PingDelegateAddressOf ScanServer         Dim ar As IAsyncResult  d.BeginInvokeserver, AddressOf ScanIsDone, d         Select Case WaitCountAll             Case 1 To 64                 waitHandles.Addar.AsyncWaitHandle             Case 65 To 128                 waitHandles2.Addar.AsyncWaitHandle             Case 129 To 192                 waitHandles3.Addar.AsyncWaitHandle             Case 193 To 256                 waitHandles4.Addar.AsyncWaitHandle         End Select          While ThreadsOpen gt ThreadMax  1             Thread.Sleep200         End While         If CancelScan  True Then Exit For      Next      If waitHandles.Count ltgt 0 Then WaitHandle.WaitAllwaitHandles.ToArray     If waitHandles2.Count ltgt 0 Then WaitHandle.WaitAllwaitHandles2.ToArray     If waitHandles3.Count ltgt 0 Then WaitHandle.WaitAllwaitHandles3.ToArray     If waitHandles4.Count ltgt 0 Then WaitHandle.WaitAllwaitHandles4.ToArray      Thread.Sleep1000  End Sub codepre  pEdit The array is empty when i break it.

Negative 15167 pI have an application that requires data be loaded in a certain order the root URL, then the schemas, then finally initialize the application with the schemas and urls for the various data objects.  As the user navigates the application, data objects are loaded, validated against the schema, and displayed.  As the user CRUDs the data, the schemas provide firstpass validation.p  pIm having a problem with initialization.  I use an Ajax call to fetch the root object, .when, and then create an array of promises, one for each schema object.  That works.  I see the fetch in the console.p  pI then see the fetch for all the schemas, so each .ajax call works.  fetchschemas does indeed return an array of promises.p  pHowever, that final when clause never fires and the word DONE never appears on the console. The source code to jquery1.5 seems to imply that null is acceptable as an object to pass to .when.apply, as when will build an internal Deferred object to manage the list if no object is passed in.p  pThis worked using Futures.js.

Device discovery is a heavyweight procedure on the Bluetooth adapter and will significantly slow a device connection. Use cancelDiscovery to cancel an ongoing discovery.

Negative 15167 pI need an advice on piece of functionality that I am ought to implement. The scenario is that we haven an HttpHandler which servers to intercept file uploads. In the handler, I need to persist a large dictionary of strings inside the memory. The dictionary might be as large as 100 entries. I am wondering whether it is safe to store that in a static variable, so that it is not initialized every time instance of the handler is created there will be a lot of instance for sure. In general, what is the approach in such scenarios. Is it a generally better idea to use static fields, to persist data that will not be changedp

Negative 15167 pHow can I communicate in a very simple and effective way the path the user takes through my applicationp  pIm currently working in a Ruby and Rails environment, so I tend to visualize my application in terms of RESTful URIs. So for example, if I want my users to sign up, I could match a new route called usersnew. The thing is, I would like to see beyond that specific action, and visualize how many pages or forms does it take to create an account and some business logic associated with the process in general. In other words, Id like to see a mix of a workflow diagram and some implementation details at an interface level.p  pI was thinking in showing mockup pictures wrapped in boxes, and relate them through arrows with their corresponding GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods and URIs attached to them. I think it is a good idea, but I havent seen examples yet that inspire me.p  pIn your experience, what helps you see the big picture Balsamiq mockups allow to define links and navigate through the app, but it doesnt help to conceptualize.p

Negative 15167 pThe short story is our CMS limits us to using solely htmljs. Im creating a dynamic graph page that has a lot of data that will be updated monthly.

Negative 15167 pIve started using VTD I guess VTDXML in Java, and for XPath reads its excellent. Where im hitting an issue now is with inserting data.

It looks like my understanding is incorrect, since simply inserting the element content does nothing to the nav if I output the VTDNav, it still contains my original xml. The only way I can seem to get a handle on the new xml, is by outputting it from the XMLModifier.p  precodemodifier.outputAndReparse  Gives me a new VTDNav with the new content codepre  pIs there something im missing here Is there an easier way of doing this I wanted to be able to insert the new content, and then immediately get the new index. My existing code using the standard DOM classes has a ton of inserts and updates, and I also need to know where the last inserted element existed in the document. Having to outputAndReparse everytime and then find the inserted element which I may not even be able to guarantee doesnt seem like a plausible solution.p

Negative 15167 pIm running into problems when I try to save entities that have a parentchild relationship in EF4.  Sometimes, the child will be inserted before the parent  which obviously will cause problems from a referential constraint point of view.  The two tables are structured like thisp  precodeOrderHeader   OrderID PK  OrderDetails   OrderID PK   DetailID PK codepre  pthere are more columns, but they dont matter.p  pstrongNotestrong We dont expose a true foreign key on OrderDetails.OrderID but instead we use triggers to enforce that the OrderID of the Details table exists in the Header table.  Exposing FKs might be a quick solution but in the our application, those kinds of changes to the database wont be allowed  we have to deal with legacy code, etc.p  pLooking at the XML in the .edmx file that the designer generates, Ive noticed that it makes an AssociationSet and Association in the Conceptual Model CSDL section  and the Association is setup with a ReferentialConstraint.  However, it doesnt make an AssociateSet or Assocation in the SSDL section.  It seems like those only get added when the FK is exposed in the database.  For other databases Ive tested on like AdventureWorks or Northwind that do have true FKs in the database, when I generate the model from the database, I see that the EDMX includes Association and AssociationSet sections in the SSDL.p  pIt appears that EF ignores the association that we have in the model CSDL and instead just does inserts alphabetically by table name  so we are out of luck in this case since OrderDetail sorts before OrderHeader and we certainly dont have the power to rename tables in our case.  If I manually add a corresponding AssociationSet and Association in the SSDL section, the save occurs in the correct order first insert Header, then insert Detail.  However, anytime we do an Update Model from Database those manual changes go away so its not a very practical solution.  Ive thought about trying to do that fixup dynamically at runtime but it feels like that is a lot of effort to work around something that should just work.p  pIm hoping there is a way that EF can respect the Referential Constraint andor Association that is defined in the CSDL when it orders Inserts.p

Negative 15167 pstrongBackgroundstrong br My CSS360 group is attempting to create an Android application that will include an autocomplete search feature.  The data that well be searching consists of around 7000 entries, and will be stored in a SQLite database on the phone itself.  The most obvious approach would be to do a linear search of the database following every character that the user types, and then return a list of suggestions which are potential alphabetic extensions of the users query.  However, this seems like it would be pretty inefficient, and weve been looking for better alternatives.  In another one of my classes today, my instructor briefly discussed the trie data structure, and mentioned that its often used to store entire dictionaries.  Entries into a trie can be retrieved in logarithmic time as opposed to linear time for a regular old array, so this seems like a great tool for us to use  Unfortunately, were in waaaay over our heads on this project already, and none of us really have a clue how to make this happen.  All any of us have ever coded to date are basic console applications to teach us programming basics.  Were all attempting to learn the Android platform in a weeks time by watching YouTube videos, and differing the database stuff to the one guy in our group who has any SQL experience whatsoever.  We could seriously use some pointersp  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ul liWhen creating a trie, is it possible to have the entire structure prepopulated  IE generate a line of code for every node used, so that the entire structure will already be in memory when the program starts  My thinking here is that this will save us the overhead of having to regenerate the entire trie from the database every time the program starts.  If so, is there an easy way to get these thousands of lines of code into our program  IE Some sort of script which converts the database files into a giant text file of java commands which can be copied and pasted into Eclipseli liWill there be a considerable amount of overhead if we search the database directly instead of using some sort of internal list or data structure  Should we be copying the names out of the database and searching them inside the program for our autocomplete functionli liIf this proves too technically difficult for us, and we have to resort to a regular linear search, will the performance be noticeably affectedli liOur current plans are to run the autocomplete function each time the user enters a character, and then wait for the function to return before allowing them to continue typing.  The only programs any of us have written so far function synchronously like this.  What would we need to know to make this function asynchronously  Considering our novice abilities, and the requirements that were already having to meet, would this be too technically challenging for usli ul

Negative 15167 pgot some great feedback last time.p  pIm essentially setting up a Wikitype system on my local computer. Im linking between HTML files, with some already existing and some not. Im using XMLHttpRequest to check to see if the files exist.p  pThe problem comes when I need to check files that are in different directories. Ive come to find out this is a security thing in place. However, Id like to disable it if possible, just for my local files. It seems rather odd that I cant have simple Javascript that returns the text on any web page at all, but even more so on my own computer.p  pI dont have any sort of server software running, just a bundle of HTML files with Javascript in them.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 15167 pI have a native Win32 client application, and a .NET web application.  Id like to be able to encrypt a string on the client given a user supplied password, and to be able to decrypt this string on the server given the same password.  My client application is 32bit, and my .NET web application is 64bit.  On the client, Im not able to deploy the .NET framework.p  pI need a simple and robust solution.  By simple, I mean Id prefer a single function call.  By robust, I mean Id like an industry standard encryption algorithm like AES, and I dont want memory leaks.p  pAny suggestions on how I can accomplish this in a simple and robust wayp  pPerhaps a DLL that comes in both a 32bit and a 64bit version  My .NET web application could PInvoke to it, and my native application could just use it.p

Negative 15167 pIve migrated a website to Amazon ec2 that hooks into a service we are using that is installed on another server not on Amazon. Access to the API for that service is IPrestricted and done by sending XML data using httpbuildquery amp streamcontextcreate in PHP.p  pIf I want to connect to the service from a new server, I need to ask the vendor to add the new IP first. I did that by sending the Elastic IP to them, but it doesnt work.  While trying to debug, I noticed that the output for SERVER[SERVERADDR] is the private IP of the ec2 instance. I assume that the server on the other side is receiving the same data, so it tries to authenticate the private IP. Ive asked the vendor to allow access from the private IP as well  its not implemented yet, so Im not sure if that solves the problem, but as far as I understand the way their API works, it will then try to parse data back to the IP it was contacted from, which shouldnt be possible because the server is outside the Amazon cloud.p  pI might miss something really obvious here. I added a command to emrc.localem running CENT OS on my ec2 instance that associates the elastic IP to the server upon startup by using emec2associateaddressem, and this seemed to help make a MySQL connection to another outside server working, but no luck with the above mentioned API.p  pTo rule out one thing  the API is accessed through HTTPS, with ports 80 and 443 and a mysql port enabled in security groups and tested. The domain and SSL are running fine.p  pAny hint highly appreciated  I searched a lot already, but couldnt find anything useful so far.p

Negative 15167 pIm faced with a curious problem in my current project p  pIve got multiple Spring MVC based web apps deployed on a Glassfish 3.1 server  and I need to be able to timeout the user based on the sesion timeout parameter in their respective web.xml  no matter in which application the user is on. Please dont ask why the applications are in separate WARs  the architecture is so. The user is logged in via WebApp A and is redirected to a WebApp B  and then the user can keep jumping to different web apps  I guess you get the idea. The WebAppB etc. have numerous Ajax calls Im not even going there as well. The question, I guess, boils down to the fact that Im not able to share session data between WebApp A and WebApp B I may be wrong here  and this is where I require help and so I dont have any way to know by checking  p  precodehttpServletRequest.getSessionfalse   codepre  pin WebAppB since it returns null in both cases when the first request hits the WebAppB and the first request after a session timeout. I have to keep something in the WebAppAs session and check for its existence in WebAppBs session  which brings me back to the issue of sharing session data within web applications. I cannot use DB storage, since that would mean a DB call on every request. I got a direction by googling that crossContext thing in Tomcat helps in such scenarios  but will something like this be helpful in Glassfish  theres a crossContextAllowed property for sunwebapp.xml which I recently found. p  pIve been stuck with this for quite some time now and Im not even sure this is a question worth your time  so thanks in advance for trying to help.p  pTrishulp

Negative 15167 pIm going to be creating competitions on the current site Im working on. Each competition is not going to be the same and may have a varying number of input fields that a user must enter to be part of the competition eg.p  pCompetition 1 might just require a firstnamep  pCompetition 2 might require a firstname, lastname and email address.p  pI will also be building a tool to observe these entries so that I can look at each individual entry. p  pMy question is what is the best way to store an arbitrary number of fields I was thinking of two options, one being to write each entry to a CSV file containing all the entries of the competition, the other being to have a db table with a varchar field in the database that just stores an entire entry as text. Both of these methods seem messy, is there any common practice for this sort of taskp  pI could in theory create a db table with a column for every possible field, but it wont work when the competition has specific requirements such as Tell us in 100 words why... or Enter your 5 favourite things that..p  pstrongANSWEREDstrongp  pI have decided to use the method described below where there are multiple generic columns that can be utilized for different purposes per competition.p  pInitially I was going to use EAV, and I still think it might be slightly more appropriate for this specific scenario. But it is generally recommended against because of its poor scalability and complicated querying, and I wouldnt want to get into a habit of using it. Both answers worked absolutely fine in my tests.p

Negative 15167 pIm trying to add a UIPanGestureController to my UITableView so I can strongdetect whether the user is manually panning or they just gave an initial kickstrong and watch the view scroll by itself.

Negative 15167 pMy model has an entity Filter and an entity Color.  I want to have two ToMany relationships between them backgrounds and foregrounds.  i.e. each Filter contains an array of background colors, and an array of foreground colors, all of type Color.p  pI have two problems.  First, when I set up the relationships the inverse from Color can only have one value Im guessing this means I cant do what I want.  Second, I cant figure out how I would create a predicate to fetch only the backgrounds or only the foregrounds.  I assume the following will return all of them merged together if it worked at allp  precodeNSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [NSFetchRequest fetchRequestWithEntityNameColor] NSPredicate predicate  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormatfilter  , self] codepre  pIm about to solve this by converting Color into two Foreground and Background entities, but I dont want to do that without understanding why a single entity wont work.  Am I missing something herep  pNOTE This apparently is not intuitive to me.  I came across this exact problem again, but this time I wasnt using predicates so I didnt find the problem right away.  I had a very similar setup, but when I tried to remove a child it would initially go away, but when I restarted my app in would reappear more than once.  The more children I removed, the more I ended up with.  I eventually noticed the same children were in both relationship arrays, and when I looked at the graphical version of the model, only one of the relationships had an arrow connected to the child.  Finally, I remembered Id had this problem before  I dont understand well what was happening, but apparent the two child arrays where merged together in a weird way.p

Negative 15167 pI have written a server application that is currently running on a Ubuntu 12.04 x64 VM. The application connects to another server, sucks some data from this server, transforms it and then sends it back to client applications running elsewhere. All of this is over boostasio on top of TCP. IO is fairly heavy. p  pEvery day after a couple of hours or so of operation we see our server dropping the client connections. When the clients try to reconnect their connections are again dropped as soon as they are established. The error report by boostasio is Connection reset by peer. This goes on seemingly indefinitely. During this time I can ssh into the machine and the connection from our application to the server process is still healthy. Load is moderate. Restarting our application solves the problem.p  pAny ideas on how to further investigate this p

Negative 15167 pHello I am new to VBA code and am working on doing some nonlinear curve fitting inside of a UDF in excel. I am familiar with Matlab where most of my experience is from. I am looking for a SubFunction that will give me functionality similar to fminsearch from Matlab. Any help would be appreciated. Thanksp  pEdit2 in response to Bradp  pSay I want to write my own UDF that uses a minimization to find the cube root of a number iteratively. Could I write the following function p  precodeFunction myCubRootSResdroot As Double, rootCubed As Double As Double  Dim a As Double  a  root  root  root  rootCubed myCubRootSResd  a  a End Function  codepre  pThen this could be used in conjunction with Solver to find the cube root of any number by setting the output of this function to zero by changing the input root. However this is just one step that I need to perform in the UDF I am trying to write and this output in this case the cube root I need to use inside of my UDF which ultimately calculates the ultimate output. Then I want to use relative referencing to use my overall UDF to calculate over a range of inputs. I believe this would require doing the minimization inside of VBA and not reference cells. The encapsulating function in this case would handle the value of root and just return that. It would only have one input which was rootCubed and would just pass this along to myCubeRootSResd. So it would look something like this p  precodeFunction myCubeRootFinderrootCubed as Double as Double  .   End Function codepre  pAny help would be very appreciated I have been trying to find a simple solution to this for a while now and I just have not found an example of anyone doing this type of numerical minimization in VBA. p  pI realize that this may not be the way to go about this in VBA but the functionality needs to be preserved. Thank you for your patients with me. p

Negative 15167 pI am doing a project of building a file transfer proxy using netty which should efficiently handle high concurrency.p  pHere is my structurep  pstrongBack Serverstrong, a normal file server just like HttpFile Server example on netty.io which receive and confirm a request and send out a file either using ChunkedBuffer or zerocopy. p  pstrongProxystrong, with both NioServerSocketChannelFactory and NioClientSocketChannelFactory, both using cachedThreadPool, listening to clients requests and fetch the file from strongBack Serverstrong back to the clients. Once a new client is accepted, the new accepted Channelchannel1 created by NioServerSocketChannelFactory and waiting for the request. Once the request is received, the strongProxystrong will establish a new connection to strongBack Serverstrong using NioClientSocketChannelFactory, and the new Channelchannel2 will send request to Back Server and deliver the response to the client. Each channel1 and channel2 using its own pipeline.p  pMore simply, the procedure is p  ol lipchannel1 acceptedpli lipchannel1 receives the requestpli lipchannel2 connected to Back Serverpli lipchannel2 send request to Back Serverpli lipchannel2 receive responseincluding file from Back Serverpli lipchannel1 send the response got from channel2 to the clientpli liponce transferring is done, channel2 close and channel1 close on flush.each client only send one requestpli ol  pSince the required file can be big10M, the proxy stops channel2.readable when channel1 is NOT writtable, just like example Proxy Server on netty.io.p  pWith the above structure, each client has one accepted Channel and once it send a request it also corresponds to one client Channel until the transferring is done.p  pThen I use abapache bench to fire up thousands of requests to the proxy and evaluate the request time. Proxy, Back Server and Client are three boxes on one rack which has no other traffic loaded.p  pThe results are weird p  ol lipFile Size 10MB, when concurrency is 1, connection delay is very small, but when concurrency increases from 1 to 10, top 1 connection delay becomes incredibly high, up to  3 secs. The other 99 are very small. When concurrency increases to 20, 1 goes to 8 sec. And it even causes ab to be timeout if concurrency is higher than 100. The 90 Processing delay are usually linear with the concurrency but 1 can abnormally goes very high under a random number of concurrencyvaries over multiple testing.pli lipFile Size 1K, everything is fine at lease with concurrency below 100.pli lipPut them on a single local machine, no connection delay.pli ol  pCan anyone explain this issue and tell me which part is wrong I saw many benchmarking online, but they are pure pingpang testing rather than this large file transferring and proxy stuff. Hope this is interested to you guys  p  pThank youp  pp  pAfter some source coding reading today, I found one place may prevent the new sockets to be accepted. In NioServerSocketChannelSink.bind, the boss executor will call Boss.run, which contains a for loop for accepting the incoming sockets. In each iteration of this loop, after getting the accepted channel, AbstractNioWorker.register will be called which suppose to add new sockets into the selector running in worker executor. However, in  register, a mutex called startStopLock has to be checked before worker executor invoked. This startStopLock is also used in AbstractNioWorker.run and AbstractNioWorker.executeInIoThread, both of which check the mutex before they invoke the worker thread. In other words, startStopLock is used in 3 functions. If it is locked in AbstractNioWorker.register, the for loop in Boss.run will be blocked which can cause incoming accept delay. Hope this ganna help.p

Negative 15167 pIm a senior majoring in Computer Science. Im new at web development. Im using ASP.NET C with MS SQL Server. Ive been trying to figure out how to load images from the database onto the webpage. I have successfully done this with the following code. p  precodeltaspImage IDimageClient runatserver stylewidth100px height100pxgt  protected void LoadImage       ModelDataContext mdc  new ModelDataContext      byte[] image  from c in mdc.Clients select c.Logo.FirstOrDefault.ToArray     string base64String  Convert.ToBase64Stringimage, 0, image.Length     imageClient.ImageUrl  dataimagejpgbase64,  base64String  codepre  pRight now Im just doing it for 1 image. I will eventually be using a repeater to display multiple images on the same page.p  pThe problem is with the loading of the image. It does some weird stuff to the masterpage that it uses. Its as if it isnt applying the CSS to the masterpage. But a few seconds later it looks as it should. The problem is definitely with the loading of the image because there is no other loading problems on any of the other pages.p  pI tried posting pictures of what I am seeing, but my reputation is too low.p  pThe problem isnt browser specific, it does the same thing in all the major browsers... If anybody could help me with the problem that would be great.p  pemem Edit I realized the images that I was trying to view may have had a filesize too large and it was taking too long to get it from the database and to load the image. My new approach is to save the image to a folder within my project and saving the imageurl in the database to refer to the actual location of the image.p  pIs this the best approach keeping in mind I am nowhere near at being advanced in Web Dev p  pThanksp

One example would be a struct allocated on the heap that is accessed by many threads very frequently in a readonly fashion.  Periodically this struct needs to be rewritten and to avoid locking contention I was wondering if its safe to use codeautoptrcode to basically allow threads that have acquired a reference to keep processing until theyre finished but allowing the writer to make a copy of the struct, rewrite it and quickly swap pointers with the new codeautoptrcode instance of the struct.p  pI got this idea from codeCopyOnWriteArrayListcode in Java and hoping to perform something similarly performant in C.p

Within my ViewModels project I have a data mapper class. Basically it takes in a model and spits out a view model.

For example I have an overall PageViewModel which holds everything the XAML page requires. One of these things is a list of VehicleViewModels which is a list of vehicles that contains some view specific properties.

Negative 15167 pis there an easy way of selecting a region of an UIImage Instance and then creating a new image out of it I tried it using a pangesture Recognizer for getting the coordinates that the user selected. But with this option there is now visible feedback and i also have to transform the coordinates. Is there maybe a nice plugin or best practices for doing this p
Negative 15167 pSo I am using survreg, and I expect my predicted results to obey a lower bound of 0, but they indicate negative results frequently. I think it is somehow estimating a linear result instead of the survival model Im trying to create. Heres what Ive donep  precodelinear.first.stageltlmy  x, dataclip codepre  pFirst I estimated some points to speed up my estimation process. It fails to converge without this first stage. I create a survival object, following the code from survreg that provides an explicit example of a tobit regression. I duplicated this below for x and y. In my data set, y can only be observed at a nonnegative value, but if it is positive, it tends to be distributed normally around 200 or so with sd of about 20.  X may take any value and isnt theoretically bound by any particular number that immediately comes to mind.p  precodesurvyltSurvclipy, clipygt0,typeleft first.stageltsurvregsurvy  x,initlinear.first.stage, distgaussian, dataclip codepre  pI run the survival regression, which should be equivalent to a Tobit. To confirm that my interpretation of events were the same, I ran the following p  precodetestlttobityx, left0, rightInf, distgaussian, dataclip ptestltpredicttest pltpredictfirst.stage plotptestp codepre  pThe plot shows a flat line at zero, so upon visual inspection these commands are identical, as they should be. However, in both cases, results under 0 are predicted. This is problematic because I have stated that the leftward bound of observable information is 0.  My expectations is that all predicted values must be 0.p  pI have tried predicting using types link, response, linear, but to no avail. I assume the predict command is producing the outcomes emas if the censorship was not occurringem.  How do I produce the prediction that obeys the lower bound of 0p  pReferencesp  ol lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10777088runningpredictaftertobitinpackageaerRunning predict after tobit in package AERali lia hrefhttpstats.stackexchange.comquestions11440standardizedresidualsofatobitmodelinrhttpstats.stackexchange.comquestions11440standardizedresidualsofatobitmodelinrali ol

Negative 15167 pIm designing a small game and Im creating a class for a mob object. The class contains some broad variables that will be useful in creating multiple instances of this object. I was wondering if it would be ok to have a loader inside the class instead of a loader in the main class that could be used to load images for the mob class Im writing. p  pIs this an ok practice Ive seen some posts about having multiple loaders, and this would kind of be like that, but none of the posts seemed to mention what would be most efficient. Ive done this before in other projects, but dont have any benchmarks or anything. p  pSo can anyone tell me if this isnt too resource intensive to have each instantiation use its own loader, then set it to null after the image is loaded The scope of the project is pretty basic, but itll be nice to know for future projects.p  peditp  pI just looked into graphics.copyfromsource and realized that isnt going to work. Even more research brought me to a surprising lack of movieclip cloning. Also, as I feared, pointing multiple movieclips to the loader content removed all of them when I tried to remove one. p  pSadly even though my original choice may not be efficient, its basically the only way this can be done... Each mob has an animated swf movieclip, so I cant make bitmaps. I also cant reuse the content from loaders because if multiple movieclips point to it, altering one mob will cause changes in the movieclips of the rest. Unfortunately, Im going to  for now  stick to each mob having its own loader that is set to null after being used and loading an external swf. Apparently there used to be a way to do this in AS2, and I dont want to use library symbol with document classes. So, Im stuck.

Or is it bad to use the above method, because no one really knows how the eval method has been implemented and the code could therefore come up with some strange errors in futurep  pEDIT Here is why eval is used in the program Imagine you got like 20 objects of myStuff in a list mylist and you want to filter them by color yellow, then one can simply call [ n for n in mylist if evalquery, Dummyn ] with querycoloryellow.

Negative 15167 pI am having some issues with Corona SDK, their Android coder claims the bug is in Java or in Android that refuses to catch a exception and instead crash.p  pI never heard of that before, so, if what they are saying is true, can it be correctedp  pMy problem in particular a hrefhttpforums.coronalabs.comtopic34688howiloada16bitimage relnofollowhttpforums.coronalabs.comtopic34688howiloada16bitimageap  pAnd a summaryp  pI am trying to load a 2048x2048 image using Corona SDK. I can do it with Marmalade SDK, and with native Java, but with Corona it crashes on Nexus One and Xperia Play and probably many other untested devices on Android 2.3p  pI submitted a bug report to them, and their reply is that they have lots of fallbacks that rely on try catch blocks on their Java code, but that on the devices where it crash, it crashes instead of triggering the catch block, or it silently fails and skips the catch block entirely.p  pI want to know how to fix that issue it crashing or skipping instead of triggering the catch blockp

Negative 15167 pIs there any way to know the name of the tables involved in a SQL query executed via JDBCp  pFor examplep  precodeSELECT r.roleId FROM User u, UserRole r where r.userId  u.userId and u.name  Jonh Smith codepre  pI dont want only the result set of this query but the actual table names User and Role. I dont care about view names, but if there is no way to get the underlying table used in the view its not a big problem, but this has to work with nested queries.p  pAs for why I need this information its because I am making a platform that lets other developers build applications on top of it. In my platform I let other developers register their own queries and I store them in a database. I dont want the developers to have to bother with actually manually registering the table names along with the query itself. So at the time I am executing the query I do not really know what that query is doing.p

Negative 15167 pI am having trouble using the jQuery library DataTables.  I have followed their documentation, and have run into an odd problem.  To begin with, I was trying to use the FixedColumn feature, but even the example that they offer doesnt run at least not the one in the jsBin setup linked from a hrefhttpdatatables.netextrasfixedcolumns relnofollowhttpdatatables.netextrasfixedcolumnsa.  My primary concern, though, is that I am unable to get any functionality at all from DataTables.  I have created a simplified version of the site I am trying to work on just to locate the problem, and the simplified code works in jsBin to an extent but not at all on my own system.

Also, I included the link to FixedColumns I had assumed that it was a part of DataTables and didnt need to be included separately, but I guess not.  However, I am still not getting any functionality.  Im not sure if its the same problem or not I had somehow forgotten about the existence of console output over the past year Ive been away from web design for a long time, but now I am getting the error codeTypeError ....dataTable is not a functioncode.  I have done some looking on Google, and the possible causes seem to be that either DataTables is not loaded or that jQuery has been loaded twice.  I cant figure out where the issue is coming from, but the only link  script lines before the one in question are as followsp  precodeltscript srcajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.9.1jquery.min.js gtltscriptgt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefhttpajax.aspnetcdn.comajaxjquery.dataTables1.9.4cssjquery.dataTables.cssgt ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8 srchttpajax.aspnetcdn.comajaxjquery.dataTables1.9.4jquery.dataTables.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpdatatables.netreleasedatatablesextrasFixedColumnsmediajsFixedColumns.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pstrongFINAL Updatestrong  I found the source of this last problem turns out that, since I am using a .NET framework from the dreaded Microsofts Visual Studio editor, I hadnt seen the layout file fully, and there was a line in there that imported some other version of jQuery.  Apparently that was the issue, because once I removed it the tables began rendering properly.  Thanks for all the helpp

I want to have a maximum of 3 running at a time. This is what I have.p  precodeif [ COUNT  echo cat proccpuinfogrep processorwc l1bc ] then     wait     COUNT0 fi codepre  pAbove, I set a COUNT variable to 0, and append 1 in a for loop the same for loop that runs the convert statement. Once it hits in this case 3, number of processors1, it will wait until the childs are done, then continue.p  pThis is all fine and dandy, but lets say all my images are 48k, except for 1 which is 250mb not true, but for explanation purposes. Somewhere down the line, the script would wait for that ONE picture when the rest could be running.p  pSo finally, my question. Given the context and background info above, is there a way using the wait command or not to have a script stop at 3 processors1 childs, and only execute 1 as one finishes In context, is there a way to have 2 pictures running while the 250mb picture is doing its thing, then have 3 once it finishes As opposed to what I do now, just wait for all 3, then execute 3 more.p  pThank you for any and all suggestions p

Negative 15167 pI am an almost new programmer learning python for a few months. For the last 2 weeks, I had been coding to make a script to search permutations of numbers that make magic squares.p  pFinally I succeeded in searching the whole 880 4x4 magic square numbers sets within 30 seconds. After that I made some different Perimeter Magic Square program. It finds out more than 10,000,000 permutations so that I want to store them part by part to files. The problem is that my program doesnt use all my processes that while it is working to store some partial data to a file, it stops searching new number sets. I hope I could make one process of my CPU keep searching on and the others store the searched data to files.p  pThe following is of the similar structure to my magic square program.p  precodewhile True     printHow many digits do you want more than 20 , end     ansr  input     if ansr.isdigit and intansr gt 20         ansr  intansr         break     else         continue  fileNum  0 itemCount  0  def fileMaker     global fileNum, itemCount     tempStr       for i in permutationList         itemCount  1         tempStr  strsumi[3]      stri      stritemCount  n     fileNum  1     file  open0 Permutations 103.txt.formatansr, fileNum, w     file.writetempStr     file.close  numList  [i for i in range1, ansr1]  permutationList  [] itemCount  0  def makePermutListnumList, ansr     global permutationList     for i in numList         numList1  numList[]         numList1.removei         for ii in numList1             numList2  numList1[]             numList2.removeii             for iii in numList2                 numList3  numList2[]                 numList3.removeiii                 for iiii in numList3                     numList4  numList3[]                     numList4.removeiiii                     for v in numList4                         permutationList.append[i, ii, iii, iiii, v]                         if lenpermutationList  200000                             printpermutationList[1]                             fileMaker                             permutationList  []     fileMaker  makePermutListnumList, ansr codepre  pI added codefrom multiprocessing import Poolcode at the top.

Negative 15167 pSo, I finally discovered that JavaFX lets you use HostServices.showDocumenturi to open a browser to the given url. I have run into a problem though I cannot open up urls that contain Chinese characters. It can only interpret them as , taking you to the wrong url. AWTs Display.browseuri handles characters without a problem, so I know that it can be communicated to the browser technically. Im not sure if there is anything I can do on my end or not though.p  pMy question is Is there any way to make JavaFXs HostServices.showDocument correctly read in Chinese charactersp  pEDIT Sample stringbr a hrefhttpwww.mdbg.netchindictchindict.phppageworddictampwdrst0ampwdqbE69687 relnofollowhttpwww.mdbg.netchindictchindict.phppageworddictampwdrst0ampwdqbE69687ap  pYou can follow the link through to see the address chinese character at the very end of the url. So in doing this, I noticed that it converts the character to a series of , letters, and numbers. Plugging those into showDocument in place of the character works fine. So then, I guess the question is now How do I convert a character to this formatp

Negative 15167 pI have a web interface that I built into the admin section of a WordPress site. It scrapes a few tables in my database and just displays a big list of data row by row. There are about 30,000 rows of this data, displayed with a basic echo in a for loop. Displaying all 30,000 rows on a page works fine. p  pAdditionally, I include an option to download a CSV file of the complete rows of data. I use codefopencode and then codefputcsvcode to build the CSV file for download from the result of the data query. This feature used to work, but now that the dataset is at 30,000, the CSV will no longer generate correctly. What happens is the first 2001000 rows will be written to the CSV file leaving out the majority of the data. I estimate that the CSV that is not properly generated in my case would be about 10 Megs. Then the file will download the first 2001000 rows as though everything was working correctly. p  pHere is the codep  precode This gets a huge list of data from a SP I built. This data is well formed data  thisgtrunstatsstoredprocedurejobtoreport   This is where the data is converted into a csv file.

Negative 15167 pNew to ember.js. What Im trying to do is create a transitional route that has no path, that I can pass an AJAX promise to as the model when I transition to it, and then it makes a redirect decision once the promise completes. I want the LoadingRoute view to be invoked while this is happening. Ive tried to accomplish that with the following routep  precodeApp.LoginUserRoute  Ember.Route.extend     setupController functioncontroller, model          Model should be a promise         model.thenthis.success.bindthis,this.failure.bindthis     ,      success function data          if data.success              App.loggedInUser  App.User.createdata             console.logApp.loggedInUser             Make redirection decision                  else              alertdata.error              ,      failure function           Failure code       codepre  pHowever, when I try to pass the promise to the route like followsp  precodevar request  .postapi.php, action createuser, username this.username, password this.password this.transitionToRouteloginUser,request codepre  pI get the error More context objects were passed than there are dynamic segments for the route loginUser because Im trying to create a pathless route and Ember requires that the model be serialized into the path when passed using transitionToRoute.p  pThe reason I need this isp  ul liThe login event can happen from multiple controllers when the user registers, when they login using the login screen, or when the application first loads if the right cookie is detected and I dont want to duplicate the login logic across all those controllers.li liAfter the login completes, theres multiple different routes the user could then be directed to, depending on the nature of the returned user object.li liI want the LoadingRoute to be invoked while the request is completing.li ul  pI assume the solution to my problem is not to use routing, but rather something else. However, Im not sure what the something else would be.p

Negative 15167 pWeve recently noticed a problem where some user agents would repeat the same POST request without the user actually physically triggering it twice.p  pAfter further study, we noticed this only happens when the request goes through our load balancer and when the server took a long time to process the request. A packet capture session eventually revealed that the load balancer drops the connection after a 5 minute timeout by sending a TCP Reset to the client however, the client automatically resubmitted the request without user intervention.p  pWe observed this behavior in Apache HTTP client for Java, Firefox and IE 8. I cannot install other browsers to test. This makes me think this behavior is part of the HTTP standard, but this is not very easy to google.p  pAlso, it seems this only happen if the first request is submitted via a keptalive TCP connection.p

Negative 15167 pIs it totally impossible to download a pdf file through an XHR request I know there are many other discussions already on this topic but sadly, I am still not satisfied with them. I am using AngularJs and making a request by using its codeHttpcode method. It is not returning any file download popup. But if I hit with the same URL in a new Browser Window then I am getting a popup. I have already tried a workarround and its working fine i.e. codedocument.location.href  urlcode but If I do this then I am unable to show the waiting image till the time the download popup is ready and appeared. So the work arround is not enough for me. I would like to do it with a genuine way through a request to the server through which I can handle the alternative flows of the outcome as well.p
Negative 15167 pThis whole problem has come up because our data input people are useless. We have a form for adding items to a database, and one of the fields is a price.

Negative 15167 pMy EmberJS app is confusing me a lot at the moment. I have a collection view, that in turn defines an itemViewClass of a custom view I have defined in my code. Something likep  precodeApp.CarouselView  Ember.CollectionView.extend     itemViewClass App.SlideView.extend,  codepre  pAnd this CarouselView is rendered inside a template that has a dynamic segment backing it I hope this makes sense . The controller for these dynamic segment is an array controller because the model for these dynamic segments is a collection  more confusion, please let me knowp  precodeApp.SlidesController  Ember.ArrayController.extend codepre  pBy now all of you have figured that I am basically rendering a bunch of slides inside of a carousel. And these are dynamically backed in the collectionView by setting the propertyp  precodecontentBindingcontroller  property set in CarouselView, controller corresponds to SlidesController codepre  pThe confusion begins now. I want to add a slide to the existing set of slides. So I provide a button with an strongaction  add targetviewstrongp  pIn the SlidesView,p  precodeactions    add function       var carouselView  this.getchildViews[0]         SlidesView has carouselView and another view as its child, hence this.getchildViews[0] is carouselView       var newCard  carouselView.createChildViewApp.SlideView.extend       carouselView.getchildViews.pushObjectnewCard       codepre  pThe above piece of code sucks and hurts me bad. I want to basically add a new SlideView to my CarouselView collection programmatically upon a button trigger. But apparently Ember recommends that childViews should not be manipulated directly and I ought to instead change the underlying content.  It states in my console.log that manipulating childViews is deprecated etc.p  pSo essentially I need to add something to my content to my SlidesController content  However, I dont want to add something to the content, this is just a soft add, that is providing the user with a slide so that he may choose to edit or add something if he wants to. He can always discard it. A hard add that will require me to persist the new slide to the DB will come once the user decides to save this information.p

Negative 15167 pI am a beginner in cocos2dx ios game development.I have 12 sprites in a CCArray and they are falling from top to bottom of the screen randomly. Any sprite can appear any time. I have done layering that the sprite at array index 0 will come at layer 12 and at index 1 will come at layer 11 and so on.So that the sprite coming first appear ahead of the sprite coming second. But the point is this situation is not always true.The sprites can come like index 5 first and then index 4 and so on. So how to detect collision of the sprites present in the same array such that if they touch each others bounding box then I can make them slow for a second or something else so that they dont overlap with each other.I am not using Box2d and dont want to use it. I just want answer without using box2d and only in cocos2dx using c.Anyone who can help me Thanksp

Negative 15167 pstrongProblemstrongp  pI am given a long list of various position titles for jobs in the IT industry support or development I need to automatically categorize them based on the general type of job they represent. For example, ITsupport analyst, help desk analyst... etc. Could all belong to the group emITSupportem.p  pstrongCurrent Approachstrongp  pCurrently, I am manually building regex patterns to accomplish this, which change as I encounter new titles which should be included in a group. For example, I originally used the patternp  pemHELPSERVICE DESKemp  pto match emITSupportem type jobs, and this eventually becamep  pemHELPSUPPORTSERVICE DESKANALYSTemp  pwhich was even more inclusive.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pI feel like there should be a fairly intuitive way to automatically build these regex patterns with some sort of algorithm, but I have no idea how this might work... Ive read about NLP briefly in the past, but its extremely alien to me... Any suggestions on how I might implement such an algorithm withwithout NLPp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIm considering using a decision tree, but it has some limitations which prevent it from working in this situation outofthebox for example, if I have built the following tree p  pstrongServiceDeskSupport OR Analyststrong em...where Support and Analyst are both children of Deskemp  pSay I get the string Level1 Service Desk Analyst... This should be categorized using the decision tree above, but it will not inherantly match the tree since there is no root node named Level or Level1.p  pI believe I am heading in the right direction now, but I need additional logic. For example, if I am given the following hypothetical stringsp  ol liIT Service Desk Analystli liLevel1 Help Desk Analystli liComputer Service Desk Supportli ol  pI would like my algorithm to create something like belowp  pstrongService OR HelpDeskAnalyst OR Supportstrong em...where Service and Help are both root nodes, and both Analyst and Support are children of Deskemp  pBasically, I need the following strongI would like this matching algorithm to be able to reduce the strings it is presented with to a minimal number of substrings which effectively match all of the strings in a given cateogory preferably using a decision treestrong.p  pIf I am not being clear enough, just let me know p

Negative 15167 pI have a UISlider control placed right under a play button image. The image is removed once the user taps on the play button.

However, the way its set up here is that all members of the group have their security databases set to the security database on the cluster host.

Im saying this, as I feel this php loop might be the issue. p  pMy current code structure, including the scripts for the checkboxes and expand div is as followsp  precodeltscriptgt            document.readyfunction                       .fliplogo.clickfunction                    .panellogo.slideToggleslow                                  ltscriptgt          ltscriptgt         document.readyfunction         input[nameall],input[nametitle].bindclick, function         var status  this.ischecked         input[typecheckbox], this.parentli.attrchecked, status                           ltscriptgt          ltdiv classnavbar navbarinverse fliplogo stylepadding5px colorwhitegt         Car Manufacture          ltdivgt            ltdiv idsites classnavbar navbarinverse panellogo styledisplaynone minheight0pxgt              ltligt               ltinput typecheckbox nameall idall stylecolorwhite checkedgt                  ltlabel forall stylecolorwhitegtSelect All Manufactures               ltlabelgtltbrgt              ltphp               webserver  localhost                administrator  root               password                 dbname  cdb               db  mysqliconnectwebserver, administrator, password, dbname                 or dieError connecting                query  SELECT DISTINCT make,logo FROM cars               result  mysqliquerydb, query                 or dieError in query query               row  mysqlifetchassocresult               i  0               whilerow  mysqlifetchassocresult                                   i                   echo                                         ltinput typecheckbox styledisplaynone id.i. value.row[make]. checkedgt                       ltlabel for.i.gtltimg src.row[logo]. styleheight50px width50pxgt                     ltlabelgt                                                   gt             ltligt           ltdivgt codepre  pAnd cssp  precode.inputhidden      position absolute     left 9999px   sites label      display inlineblock     cursor pointer   sites labelhover      backgroundcolor 500000   sites label img      padding 3px       input[typecheckbox]checked  label img      backgroundcolor ccc  codepre  pThis Fiddle shows the select all code Im using a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netH37cb433 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netH37cb433ap  pand this Fiddle for the checkboxes a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netZgh241171 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netZgh241171ap  pEven if I try it all on its own on my site just with the code from the all checkbox fiddle it acts the same.

Negative 15167 pI have a really perplexing issue here. I have a table that is built dynamically probably an unimportant fact here, but just so you know.

Negative 15167 pI have a logging function which works like thisp  precode public function void ConsoleUIlogconst stdstringamp format, ...      valist args     vastartargs, format     logformat, args     vaendargs    overloaded private function void ConsoleUIlogconst stdstringamp format, valist args      wprintw outWin, format.cstr, args     wprintw outWin, n     printf format.cstr, args     printf n  codepre  pSide note This should do the exact same thing as just a normal printf, so its pretty useless in this state. Thats because this is a minumal working example.

Negative 15167 pIn our Medical Application we integrate Nunances Dragon Speech Recognition. In API it called as SAS.p  pIn One Dashboard We designed UI by using TabSheet of Vaadin framework. Tabsheet basicaly makes one tab in html say div visible and apply css property visibilityhidden to other tabs divs.p  pSAS basicaly inspects all Input fields like textfield when onLoad event occurs of Page. and it makes it speach enabled.p  pSAS clearly States  Hidden or disabled controls, i.e. controls with the disabled attribute or the CSS properties visibilityhidden or displaynone, are excluded from speech recognition by default. This can be overridden by setting the datanusaenabled attribute on these controls to true .p  pNow My Question is how can I add this costume attribute to vaadin textfields or tabs component  We are using vaadin 6.8  .... please help me.p

Negative 15167 pI am a student in computer engineering and for our first year project we had to create a XNA game. And I really liked it, so I decided to create my own RPG Horror Game. p  pSince I want to make it as good as possible, I tried to share it with friends so that they would test it but they couldnt install it without having to install XNA Framework, and to do so something else like Visual C Express for example. Ive looked through topics and there doesnt seem to be any other way to avoid that, I at least wanted to create an Installer so they wouldnt have to download anything themselves they are not really into computer sciences so it may be difficult for some. So I a hrefhttpwww.advancedinstaller.comdownload.html relnofollowdownloaded Advanced Installera and tried to do so, but it still doesnt work as planned... p  pSo my question is Has somebody has done this before, or does anybody knows a way to create a good installer  I want to release it as a demo for the moment so it would be a lot easier for me...p  pEdit  BradleyDotNet my bad, I will be more careful next time Elias Yes, that what I tried the first time. The publish option gives me a File folder, a setup.exe and a .application I tried to run them on a computer that didnt have XNA and it still wants me to install it before, and so to install Windows Phone, Visual C or something like this  I think I followed the tutorial and maybe I did something wrong, But since thats not the first time I try this option it bothers me. p  pThanks a lot for your helpp  pStanp

Heres the interface to the call.p  precodefunction JclSimpleSendMailconst Recipient, Name, Subject, Body AnsiString   const Attachment TFileName ShowDialog Boolean ParentWND THandle   const ProfileName AnsiString const Password AnsiString Boolean codepre  pThe problem is it pops up the default MAPI client message box modally in my case Outlook 2010.  I would like it to just open the email message window, but allow the user to continue working in the Delphi App. until they are emreadyem to send, eg, in case a user wants to continue working in the Delphi App before sending the email.  Is this possible p  pI noticed there is a ParentHWND property in TJCLEmail, I tried setting that to zero I know it was a reach, but I was hoping that removing the parent handle might change the modal behavior no luck  p  precodefunction TForm1.SimpleSendHelper2const ARecipient, AName, ASubject, ABody AnsiString const AAttachment TFileName   AShowDialog Boolean AParentWND THandle const AProfileName, APassword, AAddressType AnsiString Boolean var   AJclEmail TJclEmail begin   AJclEmail  TJclEmail.Create   try     AJCLEmail.ParentWnd  0  TRIED FORCING THE ATTACHED HANDLE TO ZERO     if AParentWND ltgt 0 then             AJclEmail.ParentWnd  AParentWND     if ARecipient ltgt  then       AJclEmail.Recipients.AddARecipient, AName, rkTO, AAddressType     AJclEmail.Subject  ASubject     AJclEmail.Body  ABody     if AAttachment ltgt  then       AJclEmail.Attachments.AddAnsiStringAAttachment     if AProfileName ltgt  then       AJclEmail.LogOnAProfileName, APassword     Result  AJclEmail.SendAShowDialog   finally     AJclEmail.Free   end end codepre  pThis also successfully opened up the Default MAPI app and filled in all of the information passed TO, Subject, Body, Attachment.  Unfortunately it still opens the message box modally.p  pFinally, I also tried the code at a hrefhttpwww.delphifaq.comfaqdelphinetworkf236.shtml relnofollowhttpwww.delphifaq.comfaqdelphinetworkf236.shtmla This code just Uses MAPI directly no JCL.  Unfortunately, it also pops up the message box modally. p  pAny thoughts on how I can open the default MAPI client nonmodallyp  pThank youp

Negative 15167 pIm using Shibboleth as the SP in my SAML authentication for my asp.net application. The Idp authenticates the user and sends the response to shibboleth which sets http request variables for each of the attributes returned from the Idp.p  pThe logs below show two authentication requests.  The first one I can see the attributes being sent correctly, but the second one have none of the attributes being sent.  The attributes are normally sent in the xml response from the idp in a samlAttributeStatement node, but this does not appear in the second request. The warn log below shows this as well.p  pWhy would these attributes not be sent from the Idp on the second requestp  pIs there anything else I can look for in the configlogsp  pI have not been able to recreate the issue consistently yet.

The only problem is that in the Cotiza tu lote section theres an iframe of a request quote system and that iframe causes conflicts specifically in IE.

When I open the console in IE it appears that for some reason its not loading jQuery correctly which breaks all the following functions.p  pThe thing is that... on the site I am using a different version of jQuery and as far as I know if the request quote system is in an iframe there shouldnt be any issues because of cross domain protection.p  pI used Foundation 5 to build the site and Im using its a hrefhttpfoundation.zurb.comdocscomponentsinterchange.html relnofollowInterchangea component to switch the request quote system to a contact form as its not responsive.p  pYou can go to the Cotiza tu lote section using a hrefhttpwww.kantara.com.mxcotizador relnofollowthis linkap  pYou can see the iframe source separately using a hrefhttpwww.navegantes.mxcotizadorkantaracotizador relnofollowthis linkap
Negative 15167 pI am creating a new application for my client and I need a special login form. This form is currently authenticating with a database table users in my local database userrole tables . I configured a static datasource root to connect to database and then, in the login form, I authenticate with the database table. The problem is that my client needs to create a kind of dynamic datasource.

Negative 15167 pId like to take advantage of some of the Spring Boot autoconfigured beans in XML configuration files, but I keep running into exceptions and errors when I try to do so.p  pFor example, if I have datarelated libraries on my class path, Spring Boot will autoconfigure a codeDataSourcecode object which I can autowire into my own beans and classes, like sop  precodeConfiguration ImportResourceclasspathxmlconfig.xml public class Config        This works     Autowired     private DataSource dataSource      Bean     public ClassThatRequiresADataSource          ClassThatRequiresADataSource foo  new ClassThatRequiresADataSource         foo.setDataSourcedataSource         return foo       codepre  pHowever, if I try to do the same in an XML configuration file, I will get an exception.

Negative 15167 pIve had a maddening problem that I need some help with.  Im attempting to write a file finder or parser that finds all of the files of a given format in a directory.  I want this to be a class, and I also want it to run in its own separate thread from main.  I am using Ubuntu 14.04LTS, with its boost installation 1.54.

Negative 15167 pI have created Service which contains several notifications in the foreground to indicate its status searching, lock, disabled... etc.. I would like a way to add a PendingIntent which points to the activity that called my service there may be several activities that can call or bind to this service.  Is there a way to relay the activity class where the StartServiceIntent was called, via the Intent. p  pMy intention is to not hard code the activity classes into the service, but instead pull the .class from the intent, in the services onStartCommand....p

Negative 15167 pi have a XMLSchema which contains base64 binary data. The problem is, if the binary is big enough I unsurprisingly get an OutOfMemoryError. I managed to generate the affected java class to use the DataHanlder instead of a byte[] but still JAXb seams to do the marshaling in RAM. The used schema cannot be changed and is very complex so building the XML by handy is not a solution. The only idea i have on this is adding a placeholder instead of the big binary and replacing it afterwards.

Negative 15167 pstrongContextstrong Our company has a suite of testing software that wasnt designed to be osportable i.e. it was only designed to work on Windows.  Recently weve been trying to set up the testing suite and environment on my Mavericksrunning Macbook Air, but again and again were running into issues of a program looking for a file in a windowsonly filepath like codeCfolder1file.txtcode.  p  pstrongSolutionstrong Now of course the obvious way to solve this is to use codesys.platformcode to figure out what OS the program is running on, and then choose a corresponding filepath if statements.  But I was wondeirng if its possible for me to set up some kind of symbolic link on my Mac, so that when the Python program looks for codeCfolder1file.txtcode, the OS will redirect it towards codefolder1file.txtcode, the corresponding UNIX filepath.p  pIs this possible  If so it would be a much faster solution then going through every file io in the suite and adding in if statements and UNIX friendly filepath alternatives.  p

This in turn will allow the user to scroll if the cells widths are larger than the available area.p  pThink of it like a multitrack audio editor, where each view is a track, but the tracks can have different lengths.p  pAt the moment, the NSView cells seem to adjust width automatically to the size of the table column, so I can see two possibilities One is to make it so the cell NSViews set their width, and somehow have this promulgate everywhere else.  The other is to have the tableview or nstablecolumn set its width based on the maximum width. I have tried setting the NSTableColumn width and minWidth, but this doesnt seem to work it doesnt always adjust to the correct size, if the size is big.p  pAny suggestions or help to make this work p

Negative 15167 pXcode 6.1.1p  pWe are trying to sign our app for distribution or even just to test on physical device. We have a referenced framework in our project. We were under the impression that we should only sign our app itself and we have all code signing identities, provisioning profiles, etc. set up, but we should not sign this external framework, since we didnt write it.

Negative 15167 h1Backgroundh1  pI am working on a C program which currently runs Node via Process.Start. I am capturing the stdout and stderr from this child process and redirecting it for my own reasons. I am looking into replacing the invocation of Node.exe with a call to Edge.js instead. In order to be able to do this I must be able to reliably capture stdout and stderr from the Javascript running within Edge, and get the messages back into my C application.p  h1Approach 1h1  pIll describe this approach for completeness in case anybody recommends it  p  pIf the Edge process terminates, it is fairly easy to deal with this by simply declaring a codemsgscode array and overwriting codeprocess.stdout.writecode and codeprocess.stderr.writecode with new functions that accumulate messages on that array, then at the end, simply return the codemsgscode array. Examplep  precodevar msgs  [] process.stdout.write  function string      msgs.push stream o, message  string   process.stderr.write  function string      msgs.push stream e, message string     Return to caller. var result   messages msgs ...other stuff...  callbacknull, result codepre  pObviously this only works if the Edge code terminates, and msgs may grow large in the worst case. However, it is likely to perform well because only one marshalling call is necessary to get all the messages back.p  h1Approach 2h1  pThis is a little harder to explain. Instead of accumulating messages, we hook stdout and stderr using a delegate we send in from C. In the C, we create an object that we will pass into Edge, and that object has a property called codestdoutHookcodep  precodedynamic payload  new ExpandoObject payload.stdoutHook  GetStdoutHook  public Funcltobject, Taskltobjectgtgt GetStdoutHook      Funcltobject, Taskltobjectgtgt hook  message gt              TheLogger.LogMessagemessage as string.Trim         return Task.FromResultltobjectgtnull           return hook  codepre  pI could really get away with an Action, but Edge appears to require the codeFuncltobject, Taskltobjectgtgtcode, it wont proxy the function otherwise. Then, in the Javascript, we can detect that function and use it like thisp  precodevar func  Edge.Func     return functionpayload, callback          if typeof payload.stdoutHook  function              process.stdout.write  payload.stdoutHook                    do lots of stuff while stdout and stderr are hooked...         var what  requirewhatever         what.futz           terminate.         callbacknull, result   dynamic result  funcpayload.Result codepre  h1Questionsh1  pQ1. Both of these techniques seem to work, but is there a better way of doing this, something builtin to Edge perhaps that I have missed Both solutions are invasive  they require some shim code to wrap the actual work that is to be done in Edge. This is not the end of the world, but it would be better if there was a noninvasive method.p  pQ2. In approach 2, where I have to return a task herep  precodereturn Task.FromResultltobjectgtnull codepre  pit feels wrong to be returning an already completed null task. But is there another way of writing thisp  pQ3.

I hope you can help.p  pI am attempting to concatenatecombine, single digit characters in an array into a variable that takes the form of a binary string of format 10101010. There is no arithmetic involved and all characters are singledigit 1s and 0s. I have scoured the Web for a solution and I have tried everything from strcat, otoi, sprintf, etc. I have even tried using a String array[] to construct my variable and then convert type using strtoul. The code below reflects my latest attempt, which compiles successfully, but appears to produce blank characters. Understanding that I may be way off track with this solution, I am open to any solution that works.p  pThe codep  precodeinclude ltavrio.hgt include ltavrinterrupt.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  char digit[48]    char buf[9] snprintfbuf, sizeof buf, sc, digit[16], digit[17], digit[18], digit[19], digit[20],  digit[21], digit[22], digit[23] codepre  pAs you can see, the idea is to be able to take any digits from codechar digit[48]code and combine them into the desired format. Truthfully, Im not interested in adding the characters into a new array, but I got to the point of trying anything. My preference is to have the result accessible via a single variable to then use for bitwise operations and direct input into integrated components. Than you for any assistance you can provide.p

Negative 15167 pI have a program to perform a bunch of tests on a device, which Ive been running for a number of days now. The test results are normally stored in a CCLI String object and outputted to a RTF display in the program every couple seconds.

So, the RTF data is just kept inside the CCLI String object.p  pWhen I came back to check the test results, and tried to turn on the display, the program of course became nonresponsive. After waiting a long time for it to respond, I decided to use HxD a memory tool to look at the RAM used by the application. The RTF data is indeed there, in many large chunks. I endeavored to save the chunks as best I could, until I realized that they were changing as I was doing it, and also that there were so many that this would take many many hours.p  pRather than continue, I decided the best option may be to save that RAM data as a whole, and parse it later. The total file is 4 gigabytes. I would like to find a way to pull out the RTF data only and piece it together into a readable log file.

Negative 15167 pCan anybody tell me what is going wrong with this approach for single sing onp  pI have a website A with the authentication logic inside. The user can select the role to access the portal that he wants to go. The problem is how can I configure properly those websites to redirect correctly, because when I redirect, I lose the tokenredirect is a GET, I never had the cookie on the portal that I want to go. Do I am missing something in my implementation Maybe a configuration on the portal that I want to redirect I am not using the audienceUri on the webconfig, Is this related with the problem I am using a service that gives me a token if the user is authenticated. Then with that token, I want to redirect the page to the corresponding portal.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGEIG9.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEusSD.png altenter image description herep  pSaid that I will show you the Login Method in AccountControllerp  precode [HttpPost]     public async TaskltActionResultgt Loginstring ddlRoles, string ddlUrls, LoginModel user              var service  new AuthenticationServiceAgentuser.Username, user.Password         var securityService  new SecurityServiceAgentservice.GetToken         ...processing the claims        AT THIS POINT THE USER IS AUTHENTICATED        FederatedAuthentication.WSFederationAuthenticationModule.SetPrincipalAndWriteSessionTokentoken, true        .... get the url to redirect        Response.RedirecturlToRedirect, false      codepre  pMy Proxy class looks like thisp  precodepublic class UserNameTokenServiceProxy  TokenServiceProxy              region Properties          public SecurityCredential Credential  get set           endregion          region Methods          public override SecurityToken GetTokenISecurityCredential credential  null                      if null  credential                              throw new ArgumentNullExceptioncredential                           var factory  new WSTrustChannelFactory                 new UserNameWSTrustBindingSecurityMode.TransportWithMessageCredential,                 new EndpointAddressStsEndPoint                           factory.TrustVersion  TrustVersion.WSTrust13              if null  factory.Credentials                              factory.Credentials.UserName.UserName  credential.UserName                 factory.Credentials.UserName.Password  credential.Password                           var rst  new RequestSecurityToken                              RequestType  RequestTypes.Issue,                 KeyType  KeyTypes.Symmetric,                 TokenType  TokenTypes.Saml11TokenProfile11,                 RelyingPartyUri comes from a config file                 AppliesTo  new EndpointReferenceRelyingPartyUri                           try                              var channel  factory.CreateChannel                 var sToken  channel.Issuerst                  return sToken                          catch Exception ex                              return null                                endregion         codepre  pAnd the base class of that one is the following p  precodepublic abstract class TokenServiceProxy      region Fields      protected string StsEndPoint     protected string RelyingPartyUri      endregion      region Constructors      protected TokenServiceProxy              StsEndPoint  ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[stsEndpoint]         if null  StsEndPoint                      throw new ExceptionSTSEndPoint cannot be null                   RelyingPartyUri  ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[relyingPartyUri]         if null  RelyingPartyUri                      throw new ExceptionRelyingPartyUri cannot be null                  StsEndPoint  ltadd keystsEndpoint valuehttpssso.dev.MyCompany.comidsrvissuewstrustmixedusernamegt         RelyingPartyUri  valuehttpsdev.MyCompany.comMyCompanyPortalgt           endregion      region Abstract Methods      public abstract SecurityToken GetTokenISecurityCredential credential  null      endregion   codepre  pBasically we are not using the default configuration for WS with the audienceUri and the federationConfiguration section, the equivalent would bep  precode  ltsystem.identityModel.servicesgt     ltfederationConfigurationgt       ltcookieHandler modeDefault requireSslfalse gt       ltwsFederation passiveRedirectEnabledtrue issuerhttpssso.dev.MyCompany.comidsrvissuewstrustmixedusername realmhttpsdev.MyCompany.comMyCompanyPortal requireHttpsfalse gt     ltfederationConfigurationgt   ltsystem.identityModel.servicesgt codepre

Negative 15167 pI have a WinForm which contains a multitude of controls interdependent on each other for their visibility and content.  I have a pair of radio buttons, controlling a comboboxs ComboBoxA enabledisable flag and content. The selection on this combobox controls the visibility of a checkbox. The checking of this checkbox controls another comboboxs ComboBoxB visibility and content. Business requirements are quite complicated around these controls. As a result, I require the ability to fire of the events programmatically and through user action, doing different things in each case.p  pIn the checkboxs case, I check it programmatically while loading data if needed, which fires the CheckedChanged event which in turn does additional action controlling ComboBoxB. The code for this is pretty vanilla, nothing special, but my question is more theoretical than practical. Please keep reading.p  pDue to this requirement, I need a way to distinguish between programmatic checking and user action. I tried using the Click event and CheckedChanged event, setting a flag in the click event, signifying user action. Unfortunately, the CheckedChanged event fires before the Click event, deadending this trick.p  pNow, I tried using the MouseDown event to capture user action. But funnily enough, once the event fires, checkbox remains unchecked and the CheckedChanged event doesnt fire. p  pNow, I have managed to use a flag in the code to determine programmatic checking and use that to distinguish between the two, but I was curious as to why the MouseDown event didnt allow the checkbox to be checked. Any ideas I searched online but either I didnt do a thorough job of it, or google is not returning the right results for me. I apologize if anybody is actually able to find a google result for this problem. p

Negative 15167 pI know that in Kitkat and later versions android does a AOT Ahead of time compilation, this happen during app install time and result in plenty of performance benefits. But any app would be referencing number of classes from operating system, which I guess they are packaged as jar file somewhere.p  pTake the example of TextView, so when AOT happens does it also include all the reference to system dependent classes or AOT it just app exclusive procedure  in that case a good amount of performance improvements will not be reachable, as we only do a part of processing through our code.p  pMy app is too slow, I am using android system class called strongandroid.text.StaticLayoutstrong, I think if it were also precompiled whether install time or at the time OS itself was installed it would have been faster than what I am facing.p

It is so bad that the jitter buffer just keeps growing towards whatever the max size is...So if the max size is 10 packets, the jitter buffer will grow to 10 packets...If the max is 1000 packets, the jitter buffer will grow to 1000 packets.p  pPlease have a look at this log and tell me how I can improve this if possiblep  pa hrefhttpjustpaste.itms2x relnofollowhttpjustpaste.itms2xap  pThe last 2 lines in the log file shows thatp  p[PULL] 64128.000000 21.000000 156p  p[PUSH] 64139.000000 40.000000 157p  pWhen the last PULL operation happened at time  64.128 seconds the packet balance was 156 packets in other words 156 packets in the jitter buffer.

After inspecting, it is confirmed that ALL of the SVGs have been appended to the DOM and they are effectively the same as what was on SAFARI. The difference is that on FIREFOX, nothing appears. I then looked at the SVG elements attribute on FIREFOX. The width and height are both 100 as Ive set.br I then play around with this, and instead of setting a percentage, I directly change the height and width to lets say 100 and the SVG finally appears.p  pIn short, the same code works in SAFARI but does not in FIREFOX....p  pWhats going on in FIREFOX that is preventing it from appearing How do I fix thisp

However, there is no user with username codeffffcode in a result while it would be pretty logical to return him. Moreover, as for me, I would expect to see him strongas a first item in an arraystrong so that I can make codeampcount1code request and be sure that it will be found, instead of getting 100 users and filtering them. It is not a security issue or whatever else  their search engine just guesses for some reason, that these users are more interesting for me. p  pI am just wondering how such a popular social network can have such a poor API  now, it looks like I just cant work with users who have too simple, broad or popular usernames.  p  pThe only thing I want is to strongget a single users ID by his exact usernamestrong  thats exactly what this endpoint API function should do. Search for a user by name., according to a hrefhttpsinstagram.comdeveloperendpointsusersgetuserssearch relnofollowAPI documentationa. How to achieve thisp  pOf course, the first thing I have done was a message to their support. However, I still havent received any answer or commentary.p

Negative 15167 pI am writing a java program using OpenCascadeOCE c, github.comtpaviotoce , especially the package Geom dev.opencascade.orgdocrefmanhtmlpackagegeom.html. OpenCascade is wrapped by swig2.0 based on the following project github.comjeromerobertjCAEtreemasteroccjava . The most relevant wrapper files to my question are srcGeom.i wrapping the classes from the Geom package I added the specific classes like GeomCircle and srcTCol.i which contains the relevant typemaps also extended by me. Sorry for the disfigured links stackexchange wont let me post more than two but I thought it would be helpful to show as much information as possible.p  pMost of this works, only methods that are supposed to return arrays do not.

When you click submit an empty list is being passed back.  Im positive that it is to do with the constructor.

However, There is a problem that people add illegal mods to there game to be able to gain unfair opportunities in the server.p  pSo my idea was to create a custom launcher for the game that basically first of all check if the game is modded and if not, It sends a TCP request to the server that the player called codeBLAcode with the IP codexx.xx.xxcode doesnt have any mods and is going to join now.p  pAnd also btw the connection is secured with AES128 encryption.p  hr  pAnd now to my actual problem.p  pSoo.. While I was creating the encryptiondecryption system. Its a mix of AES and base64, I noticed that people could sniff the sockets and then copy the hash that was sent from the launcher to the server and then use any socket client app to simply send that hash AS IS without modifications..p  pThe server will then simply think that the launcher sent it and actually believe it and then allow that player p  pSo what I am asking for, Is there any way to workaround this  Like for example creating a way so that hashes are only useable once.p  pThanks in advanced for any help provided, greatly appreciated. And also alternate solutions other then sockets are accepted p

It may appear multiple times within that file, but as soon as it appears in two or more files, the code breaks because funcresult was already instantiated and is being overwritten, which is a nono in XSLT.p  pIf there is a way to ACTUALLY exit an EXSLT function or xslforeach loop you can assign a return variable for a function, but the function continues and foreachs are actually not loops, but more similar to function maps, that would be ideal but I have not found a way yet. p  pI have considered combining all feeds into one variable and removing the foreach loop altogether, but have had problems getting this to work from the beginning.p  pAny other possible solutions, ideas or pointers are much appreciated The file relationship here and XML is pretty hard to change, so solutions suggesting such a change are not ideal.p  pThanks in advance,br Tristan Eastburnp

Negative 15167 pI am trying to write some integration tests for some SQL server stored procedures and functions. Id like to have a database that has a known set of test data in it, and then wrap each test in a transaction, rolling it back when complete so that tests are effectively independent. p  pThe stored proceduresfunctions do anything from fairly simple join queries, to complex filtering with many layers of joins, to insertion of data to multiple tables.p  pThere are a couple stored procedures that actually use transactions  and so these are harder to test. Ill show an example of the overall code that is executed, but keep in mind this would normally be in two different spots test setupteardown, and the actual stored procedure. For this sample, Im also using a very simple temp tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE test    val nvarchar500  codepre  pExamplep  precode for this example, just ensuring that the table is empty delete from test go    begin of test setup code  begin transaction  go  end of test setup code        begin of code under test      insert into test valuesaaaa      begin transaction      go          insert into test valuesbbbbb      rollback transaction      go      insert into test valuesccccc       Example select 1     select  from test       end of code under test    begin of test teardown  rollback transaction  go  end of test teardown   checking that temp is still empty, like it was before test    Example select 2 select  from test codepre  pThe problem here is that at Example select 1, I would expect aaaa and cccc to be in the table, but actually only cccc is in the table, as SQL Server actually rolls back ALL transactions see a hrefhttpabdulaleemkhan.blogspot.com200607nestedtsqltransactions.html relnofollowhttpabdulaleemkhan.blogspot.com200607nestedtsqltransactions.htmla. In addition, the second rollback causes an error, and although this can be avoided withp  precode begin of test teardown  if trancount gt 0  begin     rollback transaction  end go  end of test teardown codepre  pit doesnt solve the real problem at Example select 2, we still get cccc in the table  it no longer gets rolled back because there is no transaction active.p  pIs there a way around this Is there a better strategy for this type of testingp  pNote Im not sure if the codebase ever does do anything after rollback or not the insert cccc part  but if it ever does, either intentionally or accidentally, it would be possible for tests to break in strange ways as unexpected data can be left over from another test. p  hr  pSomewhat similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2073737nestedstoredprocedurescontainingtrycatchrollbackpatternhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2073737nestedstoredprocedurescontainingtrycatchrollbackpatterna but there is no real solution to the problem posed here.p

Negative 15167 pstrongBackstorystrong Hi all, I just spent a lot of time reading many of the LINQ vs Nhibernate threads here and on other sites. I work in a small development team of 4 people and we dont even have really any super experienced developers. We work for a small company that has a lot of technical needs but not enough developers to implement them and hiring more is out of the question right now. p  pTypically our projects which individually are fairly small have been coded separately and werent really layered in anyway, code wasnt reused, no class libraries, and we just use the LINQtoSQL .dbml files for our pojects, we really dont even use objects but pass around values and stuff, the only time we use objects is when inserting to a database heck not even querying since you dont need to assign it to a type and can just bind to gridview. Despite all this as I said our company has a lot of technical needs, no one could come to us for a year and we would have plenty of work to implement requested features.p  pWell I have decided to change that a bit first by creating class libraries and actually adding layers to our applications. There is a big opportunity to make some good apps with overarching functionality. I am trying to meet these guys halfway by still using LINQtoSQL as the ORM yet and still use VB as the language. However I am finding it a bh of a time dealing with so many thing in LINQtoSQL that I found easy in Nhibernate automatic handling of the session, criteria creation easier than expression trees, generic an dynamic querying easier etc. So...p  pstrongQuestionstrong How can I convince my lead developers and other senior programmers that switching to Nhibernate is a good thing That being in control of our domain objects is a good thing That being able to implement interfaces is a good Ive tried exlpaining the advantages of this before but its not understood by them because theyve never programmed in a true OO amp layered way.p  pAlso one of the counter arguments to this I can see is sqlMetal generates those classes automatically and therefore it saves a lot of time. I cant really counter that other than saying spending more time on infrastructure to make it more scalable and flexible is good, but they cant see how.p  pAgain, I know the features and advantages somewhat enough I believe of each, but I need arguments applicable to my context, hence why I provided the backstory. I just am not a very good arguer I guess.p  pCaveat For all the LINQtoSQL lovers, I may just not be super proficient as LINQ, but I find it very cumbersome that you are required to download some extra library for dynamic queries which dont by default support guid comparisons, and I also find the way of updating entitites to be cumbersome as well in terms of data context managing, so it could just be that I suck hehe.p

Negative 15167 pIve got a PHP script in the works that is a job worker its main task is to check a database table for new jobs, and if there are any, to act on them. But jobs will be coming in in bursts, with long gaps in between, so I devised a sleep cycle likep  precodewhiletrue    if jobs  getnewjobs       Act upon the jobs    else       No new jobs now     sleep30     codepre  pGood, but in some cases that means there might be a 30 second lag before a new job is acted upon. Since this is a daemon script, I figured Id try the a hrefhttpus2.php.netmanualenfunction.pcntlsignal.php relnofollowcodepcntlsignalcodea hook to catch a SIGUSR1 signal to nudge the script to wake up, likep  precodeisAwake  true function usersigsigno    global isAwake   daemonlogCaught SIGUSR1   isAwake  true  pcntlsignalSIGUSR1, usersig  whiletrue    if jobs  getnewjobs       Act upon the jobs    else       No new jobs now     daemonlogNo new jobs, sleeping...     isAwake  false     ts  time     whiletime lt ts30        sleep1       if isAwake break  Did a signal happen while we were sleeping If so, stop sleeping          isAwake  true     codepre  pI broke the codesleep30code up into smaller sleep bits, in case a signal doesnt interrupt a codesleepcode command, thinking that this would cause at most a onesecond delay, but in the log file, Im seeing that the SIGUSR1 isnt being caught until after the full 30 seconds has passed and maybe the outer codewhilecode loop resets.p  pI found the a hrefhttpus2.php.netmanualenfunction.pcntlsignaldispatch.php relnofollowcodepcntlsignaldispatchcodea command, but thats only for PHP 5.3 and higher. If I were using that version, I could stick a call to that command before the codeif isAwakecode call, but as it currently stands Im on 5.2.13. p  pOn what sort of situations is the signals queue interpreted in PHP versions without the means to explicitly call the queue parsing Could I put in some other useless command in that sleep loop that would trigger a signal queue parse within therep

There are many I would like to help with, but they are far to complex for what I would want to start with.

However, I feel if I have the suggestions of more experienced developers, I may be able to cut down on the wrong turns I make.p  pShould I familiarize myself with the libraries used first  Or should I look through the core code and concern myself with what goes in under the hood after I have a basic understanding of the global picturep  pHow do you guys go about understanding the code base of a new projectp  pThank you for your time and effort.p
Negative 15167 pOK, this is somewhat frustrating.  We have a folder containing custom code snippets used by our company to ensure coding standards and the like.  I was emdocumentingem the process of actually adding said folder to Visual Studio 2008, when I accidentally added the wrong folder I added the folder one level up.  Since we have both C and VB snippets in separate subdirectories underneath said toplevel folder, I now get Missing or unspecified Language attribute errors for the two C snippets that were mistakenly added to the VB folder.  p  pHow do I get rid of these  They dont show up in the Code Snippets Manager under VB, since that only shows actual matching snippets.  I did some tinkering and looking around, and found a large XML file in AppDataLocalMicrosoftVisualStudio9.01033 called ExpansionsXML.xml.  Finding the entire directory added in there under VB snippets, I thought I had it made and deleted that node.  However, when I restart Visual Studio, the first time I load a project, I get a message that Code Snippet folders are being indexed or some such and they just appear again along with the Language attribute messages, from above.  p  pSo it would seem that this XML file is just an index, and not the actual configuration file indicating what folders are searched for snippets.  That must be somewhere else.  I did some more looking around, yet I cant seem to find it anywhere.  Is it a registry entry, by any chance  Our network admin has disabled registry editing, so I cant go looking around to see if anything turns up, but if that turns out to be the case, Ill get it reenabled and do the delete.  If its a file or folder, can anybody point me in the right direction  p  pAny help would be strongmuchstrong appreciated.  Thanks  p

Negative 15167 pI have an application where I would like to override the behavior of destroy for many of my models. The use case is that users may have a legitimate need to delete a particular record, but actually deleting the row from the database would destroy referential integrity that affects other related models. For example, a user of the system may want to delete a customer with whom they no longer do business, but transactions with that customer need to be maintained.p  pIt seems I have at least two options p  ol liDuplicate data into the necessarily models effectively denormalizing my data model so that deleted records wont affect related data.li liOverride the destroy behavior of ActiveRecord to do something like set a flag indicating the user deleted the record and use this flag to hide the record. li ol  pAm I missing a better wayp  pOption 1 seems like a horrible idea to me, though Id love to hear arguments to the contrary. p  pOption 2 seems somewhat Railsish but Im wondering the best way to handle it. Should I create my own parent class that inherits from ActiveRecordBase, override the destroy method there, then inherit from that class in the models where I want this behavior Should I also override finder behavior so records marked as deleted arent returned by default p  pIf I did this, how would I handle dynamic finders What about named scopesp

Negative 15167 pFirst, the general situation... a 3rdparty library loaded through a DLL does rendering into a HWND. Its simple 2D rendering and is not directly using D3D in a way I can see  a dependency walk on the DLL shows lots of D3DKMT functions like codeD3DKMTCreateDevicecode but not regular D3D calls like codeIDirect3D9CreateDevicecode. When I call codeIDirect3D9CreateDevicecode, the 3rdparty rendering goes screwy. It doesnt complain, but simply renders everything as black rectangles. My own rendering works fine.p  pThe specifics... the 3rdparty DLL is Mozilla XULRunner 1.9.x, which is the core of FireFox not 2.0 which features hardware acceleration, wrapped in the wxWidgets wxWebConnect library. wxWC loads the XUL DLL and provides a webbrowser GUI component.p  pI have a working app using wx amp wxWebConnect here, a compiled EXE and the code a hrefhttpwww.kirix.comforumsviewtopic.phpf25ampt911p2605 relnofollowhttpwww.kirix.comforumsviewtopic.phpf25ampt911p2605ap  pHere is my reallife code, its slightly bound to wxWidgets but not enough to make it hard to read  I get a HWND from a random window simply to initialize D3D but never render to itp  precodevoid MyFrameOnD3DButton wxCommandEvent ampevent       static bool initialized  false     static LPDIRECT3D9 mpD3D  NULL     static LPDIRECT3DDEVICE9 mpD3DDeviceNULL     ifinitialized              wxButton buttonwxDynamicCastevent.GetEventObject, wxButton         HWND mHWnd  HWNDbuttongtGetHandle         mpD3D  Direct3DCreate9D3DSDKVERSION          D3DPRESENTPARAMETERS md3dpp         ZeroMemory ampmd3dpp, sizeofD3DPRESENTPARAMETERS          md3dpp.Windowed                  true         md3dpp.SwapEffect                D3DSWAPEFFECTDISCARD          triple buffer if VSync is on         md3dpp.BackBufferCount           1         md3dpp.EnableAutoDepthStencil    0         md3dpp.hDeviceWindow             mHWnd         md3dpp.BackBufferWidth           0         md3dpp.BackBufferHeight          0         md3dpp.FullScreenRefreshRateInHz  0         md3dpp.PresentationInterval  D3DPRESENTINTERVALIMMEDIATE         md3dpp.BackBufferFormat  D3DFMTX8R8G8B8         md3dpp.MultiSampleType  D3DMULTISAMPLENONE         md3dpp.MultiSampleQuality  0          HRESULT hr  mpD3DgtCreateDeviceD3DADAPTERDEFAULT,D3DDEVTYPEHAL,mHWnd,             D3DCREATEMULTITHREADEDD3DCREATEMIXEDVERTEXPROCESSING,ampmd3dpp,ampmpD3DDevice         ifFAILEDhr             wxMessageBoxwxStringmpD3DgtCreateDevice FAILED         else                      wxMessageBoxwxStringmpD3DgtCreateDevice SUCCEEDED             initialized  true                 codepre

At first I was thinking that I would pass in a string to my function for the file name along with a couple of other relevant parameters and then return a string.

Since System.IO.FileInfo already has that functionality, I thought why not just pass in a file object instead of a stringp  pIf I do that however, then I dont see how I can write my PSUnit test without it being reliant on an external resource in this case, the file must exist for me to get the FileInfo object  or does it.p  pIs there a clean way to handle this How are others approaching these issuesp  pThanks for any help or advicep

Negative 15167 pFirst of all, I have to say, Im new to mocking. So maybe Im missing a point.p  pIm also just starting to get used to the TDD approach.p  pSo, in my actual project Im working on a class in the business layer, while the data layer has yet to be deployed. I thought, this would be a good time to get started with mocking. Im using Rhino Mocks, but Ive come to the problem of needing to know the implementation details of a class before writing the class itself.p  pRhino Mocks checks if alle the methods expected to be called are actually called. So I often need to know which mocked method is being called by the tested method first, even though they could be called in any order. Because of that Im often writing complicated methods before I test them, because then I know already in which order the methods are being called.p  psimple examplep  precodepublic void CreateAandBbool arg1, bool arg2      ifarg1         daoA.Create     else throw new exception     ifarg2         daoB.Create     else throw new exception  codepre  pif I want to test the error handling of this method, Id have to know which method is being called first. But I dont want to be bugged about implementation details when writing the test first.p  pAm I missing somethingp

Negative 15167 pThe JavaDoc for a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilconcurrentThreadPoolExecutor.htmlThreadPoolExecutora is unclear on whether it is acceptable to add tasks directly to the codeBlockingQueuecode backing the executor. a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilconcurrentThreadPoolExecutor.htmlgetQueue2829The docs saya calling codeexecutor.getQueuecode is intended primarily for debugging and monitoring.p  pIm constructing a codeThreadPoolExecutorcode with my own codeBlockingQueuecode. I retain a reference to the queue so I can add tasks to it directly. The same queue is returned by codegetQueuecode so I assume the admonition in codegetQueuecode applies to a reference to the backing queue acquired through my means.p  h2Exampleh2  pGeneral pattern of the code isp  precodeint n  ...  number of threads queue  new ArrayBlockingQueueltRunnablegtqueueSize executor  new ThreadPoolExecutorn, n, 1, TimeUnit.HOURS, queue executor.prestartAllCoreThreads  ... while ...      Runnable job  ...     queue.offerjob, 1, TimeUnit.HOURS  while jobsOutstanding.get  0      try          Thread.sleep...      catch InterruptedException e          Thread.currentThread.interrupt       executor.shutdownNow codepre  h2codequeue.offercode vs codeexecutor.executecodeh2  pAs I understand it, the typical use is to add tasks via codeexecutor.executecode. The approach in my example above has the benefit of blocking on the queue whereas codeexecutecode fails immediately if the queue is full and rejects my task. I also like that submitting jobs interacts with a blocking queue this feels more pure producerconsumer to me.p  pAn implication of adding tasks to the queue directly I must call codeprestartAllCoreThreadscode otherwise no worker threads are running. Assuming no other interactions with the executor, nothing will be monitoring the queue examination of codeThreadPoolExecutorcode source confirms this. This also implies for direct enqueuing that the codeThreadPoolExecutorcode must additionally be configured for  0 core threads and mustnt be configured to allow core threads to timeout.p  h2tldrh2  pGiven a codeThreadPoolExecutorcode configured as followsp  ul licore threads  0li licore threads arent allowed to timeoutli licore threads are prestartedli lihold a reference to the codeBlockingQueuecode backing the executorli ul  pIs it acceptable to add tasks directly to the queue instead of calling codeexecutor.executecodep  h2Relatedh2  pThis question  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2233561producerconsumerworkqueuesproducerconsumer work queuesa  is similar, but doesnt specifically cover adding to the queue directly.p

Negative 15167 pIn my memory, most people told me I should design from top to bottom. If I want to implement a web page, I should image or draw this page on paper and then divide it into some functionality. For each functionality, I try design the external API, and implement their inside respectively.p  pBut in TDD, they say I should consider a very very small functionalitya method first, write its test, fail, implement it and pass test. Composing them is the last step. I cant image how it gets good API.p  pAnd most strangely, they say TDD is not only unit tests and also function tests. I think it means topbottom. If there is a functionality A composed of methods B, C and D. Because of TDD I write the function test for A first. But... B, C, D are all unimplemented.

Negative 15167 pI am considering embedding Lua in C app running under FreeBSD 8.2. But benchmarking revealed  poor performance in some cases. Specifically when Lua tries to convert strings to numbers and compare strings, it becomes slower, and worse, ruins scalability 8 cores perform worse than one. I now think it is locale, because when I avoid autoconversion everything works fine. But for real life I will need string comparisons and number conversions. How can Ip  ol lipisolate Lua from locale, i.e. ensure that none of Luas functions use locale indirectly. For instance can I provide my own conversion and comparison functionspli lipor disable locale altogether. I tried codesetlocale LCALL, Ccode, it works ok locale changes, but bottleneck remainspli ol  pUpdatep  pfollowing suggestion by lhf I jumped right into Lua library code. What I found is dozens of places where officially localedependent functions are used. To remove all of them would cost too much effort, there must be a better way.

Also assume all variables are passed by references or a pointers.p  pEditp  pFirst, thanks for all the responsesp  pSome clarification p  pThe reason I am asking this question is I have done a good amount of Qt programming in C and Python. In Qt, there are signals and slots. This lets inner objects tell the outer object to do something. For example I have an object A with objects B and C inside of it. Some change happens to object B and B needs to let A and C know. So B will emit a signal. A will catch this signal and do what it needs to do. Then, A will also let C know that B emitted this signal. This way C can do what it needs to do.p  pThe reason I asked my question is because I was wondering how I can do something like I described without using the Qt libraries.p  pAlso, lets assume B is not an A so I cantdont want to use inheritance. p

Negative 15167 pI apologize for the probably confusing title, but I wasnt quite sure how to label this thread. At any rate, Im working on a web application that works just fine in IE, but seems to fail in Firefox for some reason. I know this seems to happen with a lot of applications at first, but the errors that the Firefox development console are giving me dont really make much sense. Here are the errors its coming up withp  precodeworkNews.textlines[i].hide is not a function syntax error data.split is not a function codepre  pThe first error is claiming that the following line of code is breaking because it thinks that jQuery.hide is not a function.p  precodeworkNews.textlines[i].hide.fadeIn500.delay4000.fadeOut500 codepre  pNow, this line of code has worked in both IE and Firefox before, but it has suddenly broken. The same with the third error, in that it believes that the split method that breaks a string up by a delimiter is not a function. Again, this line worked before, and now it suddenly doesnt. The syntax error is whats really weird... Im opening and reading lines from a text file with the .get method, which has worked fine and still does in IE. However, the Firefox developer console tells me that theres a syntax error and proceeds to point to a line of text within the file.p  pIm not sure if theres a simple thing I need to fix elsewhere in my code that is not apparent by these errors, but when encountering problems like this, I was wondering if there was any usual reason for this to happen. If you need to see more of my code, simply ask. Thank you.p  pEDIT 1 Just to be safe, heres the whole function in which all three errors are supposedly occurring. Again, this function has worked just fine in both IE and Firefox until just recently.p  precodefunction GetWorkNews      var lines  new Array var i  0     .gettextFile, functiondata          lines  data.splitn           workNews.textlines[i].hide.fadeIn500.delay4000.fadeOut500     setIntervalfunction          workNews.textlines[i].hide.fadeIn500.delay4000.fadeOut500          ifi  lines.length              i  0              , 5000  codepre  pEDIT 2 When I was tinkering around, I commented out the first jQuery line in which I call the hide function     workNews.textlines[i].hide.fadeIn500.delay4000.fadeOut500 Everything seems to work now, though the FF Dev Console still tells me theres a syntax error within my text file. I suppose I dont need this line which I commented out, for it simply primes my banner with text so that it doesnt have to wait the five seconds for the first headline to display, but Id still like it. Any ideas why that line broke, but not the exact same line within the setInterval functionp

Negative 15167 pA UITableview inherits from a UIScrollview. But, if u want a UITableview within a scrollview the best way to do this is embed it in a UIView and add that as a subview to a scrollview.  Is the above correct If yes, then UIScrollView inherits from UIView.So finally, when all three are put in the same space how do you know which is calling a particular method. This is a suddenlyconfusednewbie question. So , thanks for your patience Pp

Negative 15167 pIm new to iOS development, obviously, and Im running into a bit of an issue with many of the tutorials that I find online. While I understand the majority of the code that is going into these programs, I cannot figure out how to translate this one fact, which is probably simple.p  pMany tutorials either use the Navigationbased template or Viewbased template, but I would like to try building tab bar applications. Tutorials either use the App Delegate or rootViewController being the navigation controller, but since my tab bar is my rootViewController, I always run into an issue. Im also unable to use the applicationDidFinishLaunching method in most of my code, because it technically only applies to the first tab at launch.p  pThese are my  questionsp  ol lipIs there a way to translate these files into new classes for example, creating an instance of NSObject for the App Delegate code for each individual tab or creating instances of UINavigationViewControllerpli lipIf I can create the instance of NSObject, how do I ensure that the code links up to the objects that I create in my viewControllerpli lipIf I can create a file that uses UINavigationController, how do I trick the program into temporarily allowing the Nav Controller to be the rootViewController.pli ol  pMany thanks in advancep

Negative 15167 pIm attempting to write a reusable parsing library for fun.p  pI wrote a codeLexercode class which generates a sequence of codeTokenscode. codeTokencode is a base class for a hierarchy of subclasses, each representing different emtoken typeem, with its own specific properties. For example, there is a subclass codeLiteralNumbercode deriving from codeLiteralcode and through it from codeTokencode, which has its own specific methods for dealing with numeric value of its lexeme. Methods for dealing with lexemes in general retrieving their character string representation, position in the source etc. are in the base class, codeTokencode, because theyre general to all token types. Users of this class hierarchy can derive their own classes for specific token types not predicted by me.p  pNow I have a codeParsercode class which reads the stream of tokens and tries to match them with its syntax definition. For example, it has a method codematchExpressioncode, which in turn calls codematchTermcode and this one calls codematchFactorcode, which has to test if the current token is codeLiteralcode or codeNamecode both derived from codeTokencode base class.p  pstrongThe problem isstrongbr I need to check now what is the type of the current token in the stream and whether it matches the syntax or not. If not, throw an codeEParseErrorcode exception. If yes, act accordingly to get its value in the expression, generate machine code, or do whatever the parser needs to do when the syntax matches.p  pBut Ive read much about that checking the type in runtime, and deciding from it, is a strongbad designtradestrong, and it should be refactored as polymorphic virtual methods. Of course, I agree with that.p  pSo my first attempt was to put some codetypecode virtual method in the codeTokencode base class, which would be overrided by the derived classes and return some codeenumcode with type id.p  pBut I already see a shortcomings of this approach Users deriving from codeTokencode their own classes of tokens wont be able to add additional ids to the codeenumcode, which is in the library source  And the goal was to allow them for extending the hierarchy for new types of tokens when theyll need it.p  pI could also return some codestringcode from the codetypecode method, which would allow for easy defining new types.p  pBut still, in both these cases, the information about base types is lost only leaf type is returned from codetypecode method and the codeParsercode class wouldnt be able to detect the codeLiteralcode derived type when someone would derive from it and override the codetypecode to return something other than codeLiteralcode.p  pAnd of course the codeParsercode class, which also is meant for extending by users that is, writing their own parsers, recognizing their own tokens and syntax doesnt know what descendants of the codeTokencode class will be there in the future.p  pMany FAQs and books on design recommend in this scenario to take the behavior from the code which needs to decide by type, and put it into the virtual method overriden in derived classes. But I cannot imagine how could I put this behavior into the codeTokencode descendants, because its not their busines, for example, to generate machine code, or evaluate expressions. Moreover, there are parts of the syntax which need to match more than one token, so there is no one particular token which I could put that behavior into. Its rather the responsibility of particular emsyntax rulesem, which could match more than one token as their terminal symbols.p  pAny ideas how to improve this designp

Negative 15167 pAlright, perhaps Im missing something simple. Ive been searching for quite some time and have had no luck. I need to insert an entity into an XML attribute. In order to do this I need to be able to use an ampersandamp in conjunction with the codesetAttributecode method for the DOM class or codeaddAttributecode for the codesimpleXMLcode class. When I try to use it, it escapes the ampersand so codeampentitycode becomes codeampampentitycode. Trying to manually escape the ampersand codeampentitycode just results in codeampampentitycode. Typing out the ampersand entity codeampampentitycode just doubles it codeampampampentitycode. I understand why it does this, ampersands will break XML if not associated with a valid entity. The problem is, it is associated with an entity, and I cant figure out how to use it.p  pIve found the a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualendomdocument.createentityreference.php relnofollowcreateEntityReferencea and a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualendomentityreference.construct.php relnofollowDOMEntityReferencea methods, but the Documentation for these methods are poor and Im unsure if these are what I need. Googling these terms only seem to bring up the same PHP documentation, but from different sites. Ive tried searching for this problem separately but I just get results explaining what I already know and pointed out above. Ive tried both DOM and SimpleXML, but both produce the same results. Am I just overcomplicating this, or is this really not supportedp

Negative 15167 pIm decent at C, but I may have missed some nuance that applies here.  Or maybe I completely missed a giant concept, I have no idea.  My program was instantly crashing blah.exe is not responding about 15 times it was run other times it ran completely fine and I tracked the problem down to a constructor for a world class that was called once in the beginning of the main function.  Here is the code in the constructor that causes the problemp  precodeint ii forii0iilt255ii      coutltltent ltltiiltltendl     entitylist[ii]NULL  forii0iilt255ii      coutltltsec ltltiiltltendl     sectorlist[ii]NULL  entitylist[0]  new Entity0,0 entitylist[0]gtworld  this codepre  pSpecifically the second for loop.  The cout references are new for the sake of telling where it is having trouble.  It would print the entire ent 1 to ent 255 and then sec 1 to sec 255 and then crash right after, as if it was going for a 257th run through of the second for loop.  I set the second for loop to go until iilt254 which stopped all crashes.  Does C code tend to overshoot for loops or something  What is causing it to crash at this specific loop seemingly at randomp  pBy the way, entitylist and sectorlist point to classes called Entity and Sector, respectively, but they are not constructing anything so I didnt think it would be relevant.  I also have a forward declaration for the Entity class in a header for this, but since none were being constructed I didnt think it was relevant either.p  pEDIT It was due to the new Entity line, I assumed wrongly that the fact that altering the for statement to 254 fixed the crashes meant that it had to be there.  I still dont understand why the for loop is related, though.p

Negative 15167 pHow does DNS secondlevel domain lookup work  For example, in a url web.example.com, the toplevel domain is .com, and the second level domain is .example.  Based on my understanding, after we find a server for the toplevel domain, if this toplevel server does not actually have a record for the secondlevel domain, we query a different toplevel server.  How does DNS decide which next toplevel domain server to query  Are there a lot of toplevel domain servers in the world since there are so many secondlevel names available  Since there are so many secondlevel names, how long could this process potentially takep  pThis is described on wikipedia a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDomainNameSystemAddressresolutionmechanism relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDomainNameSystemAddressresolutionmechanisma, but this section does not explain how to efficiently find the toplevel server with the secondlevel domain info.  p  pThe point of my question is how does DNS efficiently search millionsbillions of secondlevel domains.p

Negative 15167 pI am implementing an algorithm which finds an optimal Hamiltonian path in a directed graph. I have implemented an algorithm which appears to work reasonably well, however I am not entirely sure if there are subtle bugs or other issues in certain cases. Therefore, I need a few diverse networks where the solution is known, to check if my implementation is also solving them as it should.p  pSince Wikipedia implies Hamiltonian paths is only an appropriate term for undirected graphs, assume that Hamiltonian path means a path which visits every node once and exactly once on a given network, directed or otherwise.p  pFor simplicity, we can assume that every connection or edge has a positive integer value or length. We can also assume that no node is connected to itself, and there can be no more than one edge in each direction between any two nodes.p  pI happen to be interested in the path which has the highest total length, so optimal means longest, although it probably makes little difference if I wanted the shortest total length as in the traditional TSP. I also happen to be using a greedy algorithm.p  pWhere or how might I obtain directed networks for which TSP has been solved It would be even better if the actual solution and the greedy or other heuristic solution was available. The networks should be large enough to make for an informative test, but small enough for me to manually check the solution if the solution is initially unknown. They should be topologically diverse enough to cover both easy and problematic networks.p  pFor anyone else looking for the same the best I have is the following networkp  precode  A B C D E A 0 1 2 0 1 B 1 0 0 0 1 C 0 3 0 1 2 D 4 0 0 0 0 E 1 0 0 2 0 codepre  pThis is an adjacency list, the rows are edge origins and columns are destinations. The numbers are lengths of each edge, and 0s indicate no edge. For instance, the 4 shows that the length of the edge strongfromstrong D strongtostrong A is 4, and there is no connection from emAem to emDem length 0.p  pThe maximum length path in this network is EDACB. Its total length is 233311. I believe a greedy algorithm is able to find the best solution in this case, and it happens to be possible to be obvious that it IS the best possible solution.p

Negative 15167 pI have a html page where I have 3 anchors in an ordered list.  the last two anchors need to be at the right of the page.  I understand the better way to do this involves using nthchild selectors.  I attempted to create 3 instances, one to specify each anchor and this failed.  I could get one of the instances to the right of the page but not two.  I tried, as you will see in my code, using 2n1 but that also did not work.p  pI am a bit stuck and any advice would be greatly appreciatedp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netMwT6d relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netMwT6dap

Negative 15167 pI was wondering if it was possible to extract the contents of a .jar file into a different directory, then add some files to that directory, and then compress the directory back into a .jar file, with the additions. A way of extracting the jar file i found was to use codeNSTaskcode to execute the terminal command of codejar xf location of jar filecode. This worked, but it halted the UI of the program permanently without crashing it, and unarchived the contents into the directory that the application was stored in, which was a slight mess to clean up.

Most of what Ive learned, Ive learned through trial and error.p  pI have a combobox list with dates from the SetIndex table, the value being the ID the primary key of SetIndex. I need to be able to query the database with a select statement that says setindex.id  setsong.setid and setsong.songid  song.id and setIndex.id  a variable, the chosen value from the dropdown list. I wrote a select statement in Access using setindex.id   that works just fine in Access, but I havent figured out how to do it in C.

The other confusion may be related to express versions and my confusion with npm. I believe I tested both the latest v2 of express, but Ive also tested v3, which I am running now. For version three, you probably should check out the codeconnectflashcode module on Github as well, as some to the flash stuff which is used in Jareds examples was moved out of express v3 so the module puts it back in....

Negative 15167 pAt another forum Ive came across the argument about some corner case of using constructors and I remembered reading somewhere that it would be considered a good design to forbid code outside the class own sandbox to call that class constructor. The argument was related to invoking a superclass constructor defined to accept variable number of arguments, while the particular language in question doesnt allow funcalling the constructor in general.p  pI dont remember who said that and on what occasion, but I have a feeling it was some respectful source, although, my memory may betray me. Language specifics aside, would this make sense as a metalanguage good practice, or is this just a madeup rule  too personal to be a generic recommendationp  pBelow are some justification I could think ofp  ol lipRegardless of the language, there are typically problems with initialization order, which is usually peculiar to the object being created, outside code might not be aware of these particularities  exposing these particularities may be considered as leaking the detail of implementation of the object.pli lipErrors inside constructor pose a difficulty in languages wo automatic memory management. Letting outside code manage such errors is an almost guaranteed failure  memory leak.pli lipInheritance often times requires that we both be able to reference subclass from superclass anonymously, by, for example, calling an abstract method  think of Java, where this is problematic and back not necessarily anonymously. I.e. if a superclass calls a function on its fields, we may need to preinitialize those fields to certain other values in the subclass, and, certainly, we might need to use the product of superclass initialization in the subclass. This might require to have hooks into constructor, but would not be possible, if we expose the bare constructor to outside code as the outside code may affect the object creation in such case by working outside of convention on what is being initialized and when.pli ol

Negative 15167 pIm building a web crawler in Ruby, Rails as the frontend. Im using Mechanize which is built on top of Nokogiri. I already implemented a solution that will crawl the web pages but I looking to be able to crawl 200k websites in a single run and I know theres a better way than  waiting for hours on it to finish. Im want to be able to achieve the best performance by firing up parallel requests without making it too complex. I dont know anything about threading and whats the limit on it so dont hold the server hostage while the crawler is running if someone would like to point where I can learn how to do this or at least tell me what should I be looking for. Keep in my that I will be writing to the database and to a file probably I can export form the database once the crawl is done and not write to the file directly.

Negative 15167 pI have an application that sends data to a server with a post request. This request can fail, and if it does I want it to retry until its finally sent, something similar to WhatsApp if u send a message when u are offline it stays as pendant and when you go online again the message is sent. p  pSince I dont know how WhatsApp internally works I have some doubts in how to implement that. I thought two waysp  p1 Setting an AbstractThreadedSyncAdapter to be executed every X time like 30 seconds that checks if there is data to send and, if there is, it sends it to the server. p  p2 When the user clicks to send some data, I create a thread that tries to send it and, if it fails, it sleeps some seconds and try again.p  pI really dont like any of these options.

Negative 15167 pI wrote a program for an academic project that performs a simple interest and a compound interest calculation. The problem I am having is that the simple interest calculated is truncated if the number does not have something other than zero as the cents i.e, it does not show the decimal points  if the amount is for example 1750.00 it will show up as 1750 even though I used the DecimalFormat on both my methods for compound and simple interestp  pI have extensively debugged the project and I am really at a loss as to what the hell is going on.p  pThe relevant excerpt from the program is the followingp  precode  double p1.0  just some sample values for p, r, and y.   double r2.0   double y3.0   double calculatedInterest  p  pr100y   String output  new StringComputed Simple Interest is    output  output  new DecimalFormat..formatcalculatedInterest   return output codepre  pI have the full program herep  pa hrefhttppastebin.comsgg0P5ZQ relnofollowhttppastebin.comsgg0P5ZQap  pstrong[EDIT] Moral of the storystrong If you dont read the JavaDoc of a class you are having issues with or dont understand, you are going to have a bad time. The symbolic pattern . is not just the universal catchall for the DecimalFormat, different symbol patterns do different things.

Negative 15167 pIm generating hashes MD5 of numbers from 1 to N in some threads. According to the first letter of the hash, the number that generates it is stored in an array. E.g, the number 1 results in c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b and the number 2 in c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c, so they are stored in a specific array of hashes that starts with c.p  pThe problem is that I need to generate them sorted from the lower to the higher. It is very expensive to sort them after the sequence is finished, N can be as huge as 240. As Im using threads the sorting never happens naturally. E.g. One thread can generate the hash of the number 12 c20ad4d76fe97759aa27a0c99bff6710 and store it on c array and other then generates the hash of the number 8 c9f0f895fb98ab9159f51fd0297e236d and store it after the number 12 in c array.p  pI cant simply verify the last number on the array because as far as the threads are running they can be very far away from each other.p  pIs there any solution for this thread problem Any solution that is faster than order the array after all the threads are finished would be great.p  pIm implementing this in C.p  pThank youp

Xcode and gcc  Right now Ruby requires gcc to compile, but Xcode 4.2 and later no longer ship with gcc. Instead they ship with llvmgcc to which gcc is a symlink and clang, neither of which are supported for building Ruby. Xcode 4.1 was the last version to ship gcc, which was usrbingcc4.2.  Xcode 4.1 and earlier  Ruby will build fine.  Xcode 4.2 and later including Command Line Tools for Xcode  If you have gcc4.2 and friends from an earlier Xcode version, Ruby will build fine.

Negative 15167 pIs there an intent for sending data for the keyboard to typep  pThis is more theoretical than practical, but is it possible to broadcast an intent that is received by the keyboard. The intent would contain a string which is then typed into the active input field. Alternative the intent could include a target field, which the keyboard could use to either select the right field in the view or prevent the data from being output to the wrong field.p  h1Whyh1  pIm imaging this could useful for data collection applications.p  pstrongExample 1strong Bluetooth scalep  pSay you have an application for tracking your weight. Every morning you launch the app, weigh yourself, type in your weight. If the scale were paired with an application agnostic service on your phone you could just select the weight field and step up on the scale. The value would be sent to your phone and passed to the default keyboard using this intent.p  pstrongExample 2strong NFC id tagsp  pA service form application requires a 16digit machine serial number. There is an NFC tag on the machine which contains the serial number. Instead of typing it out manually, the NFC read intent is caught by a service which passes the value to the default keyboard via intent. p  pstrongCriticismsstrong p  ol liThe app couldshould integrate with the scale directly.br emCounter argumentem Does not work with a web app and you are reliant on an app supporting and maintaining support for your particular solution e.g. Bluetooth device.li liReplace the input field with a button that launches an intent for result.br emCounter argumentem Same as above, plus it requires more user interaction Clicks and time are premium commodities.li ol  pIf it doesnt exist, would it be the worst idea for keyboards to implement such an intent receiver Or would it just open the door to bad application design Securitywise p

The four possible types are, by hierarchy, codecategorycode, codeproductlinecode, codeproductcode, codemodelcode. So codecategorycode has a tree of attributes defined, which codeproductlinecode inherits and can at any point override, and so on for codeproductcode and codemodelcode.p  pThis is preexisting structure for a preexisting application, so any suggestions to restructure are unusable p  pSo, the adjacency list codeattributecode, has the following columns codeid, parentid, overridesidcode, with codeoverridesidcode if set being a reference to codeattribute.idcode, same for codeparentidcode. If codeoverridesidcode is set, codeparentidcode will always match the value of the overridden attributes codeparentidcode.p  pFor each hierarchical type, there is a supporting table mapping the type to the attribute, i.e.  codecategoryid, attributeidcode.p  pstrongI need to be able to get back a full attribute tree, with all overrides respected.strongp  pExample data this specific example only goes to product level, but you get the idea.

Negative 15167 pIm looking to draw outlines of 2Dclosed irregular shapes with curved edges, and then compute both a the center of gravity centroid of the shapes area, and b the center of gravity of the shapes emperimeterem i.e. the centroid of, e.g., a wire wrapped tightly around the outside of the shape. I have a latebeginners level proficiency with Python and Matlab. p  pa and b are easy enough given a polygons vertices the centroid of a polygons area is given by the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCentroidCentroidofpolygon relnofollowequation herea, and the centroid of a polygons perimeter is just the average of all the line segments midpoints weighted by the line segments lengths. Ive already written some functions to do this.p  pThe trouble Im having is gettingapproximating those vertices from any of the ways I know how to draw a closed shape with curved edges. The best solution Ive come up with so far is to use something like this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma77058522060238codematplotlibcodebased scripta to draw the curvy shape, and then call codepath.topolygonscode, which converts Path objects to polygons  but does so with surprisingly low resolution, such that the resulting approximation is quite poor and too poor for my purposes  Id like to compute those centroids fairly precisely. p  pSo, Im looking to either i find some way to increase the resolution of code.topolygonscode about 10fold, which would be satisfactory for my purposes, or ii try some new strategy entirely. One option would be to draw the shapes using something like Adobe Illustrator and then get an approximation of their vertices via some plugin or maybe an image processing toolbox but I have no clue how to do either of those things. Another would be to draw the shape using some toolboxlibrary that already has builtin functions for finding the centroids of areas and perimeters Ive seen some having the former, but none with the latter. But Im sure there are many other options out there that I havent considered.p

I also have a server application which provides the data that my client app needs to display I will refer to this as my strongserver appstrong. I am using a lazily load children approach so that I only have to load files into my tree if the user is interested in them. Lazy load approachp  ol liI override codetreeWillExpandTreeExpansionEvent evtcodeli liI set the selection path to be that of the expanding node.li liThen I send a message to the server asking for the children of that node.li liWhen the server responds I get the last selected path component.li liThen I use codeDefaultTreeModel.insertNodeIntocode for each the returned data files.li liFinally I call codeDefaultTreeModel.nodeStructureChangedcode.li ol  pThe above works fine and I am not having any issues with lazily loading the children. My problem comes when new data is uploaded to the server and I want to update the tree to not only include the new data, but also to set the expansion state and selected node to what it was prior to updating the tree so that the user is not jerked around on the tree just because there is new data to view. The flow is as followsp  ol liNew data is uploaded to the serverli liServer app archives this data and populates a database with information about the uploaded files.li liServer app notifies client app that new data was uploaded. li liClient app saves the expansion state of the tree using codeJTree.getExpandedDescendantscodeli liClient app saves the selection path of the tree using codeJTree.getSelectionPathcodeli liClient app removes all nodes from the DefaultTreeModel.li liClient app requests data from the server starting with the root node.li liClient app traverses the tree path enumeration returned from codeJTree.getExpandedDescendantscode calling codeJTree.expandPathcode on each TreePath in the enumeration.li liClient app sets the selected tree path.li ol  pMy problem is that no matter what I try the trees GUI is not updated to reflect the expansion state. I know that my call to expandPath is working because I can see the request for data sent from the client and the response with data from the server for each call to expandPath. I also display information about the currently selected node in another window and it is showing the correctly selected node. But, alas, to my disappointment, the GUI only displays the root node expanded and its children not expanded instead of the previous expanded state.p  pSo my question is strongHow can I restore the expansion state of my JTree so that the GUI remains the same before and after a data model updatestrongp  pThese are a few of the things that I have triedp  ul liI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6252462jtreelazyloadexpanda threada with a similar setup to mine and his problem was solved by overriding codeequalscode and codehashCodecode but that did not work for me.li liVarious methods to invoke expansion such as codesetExpandsSelectedPathstruecode, codenodeStructureChangedcode, codeJTree.invalidatecodeli liMany different variations on saving the expansion state, however, I dont believe the expansion state is incorrect as I can see the correct data being passed back and forth between the client app and the server app.li ul  pHere is my SSCCEp  precodepackage tree.sscce import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JPanel import javax.swing.SwingUtilities import java.awt.BorderLayout import javax.swing.JScrollPane import javax.swing.JTree import javax.swing.JButton import java.util.Enumeration import javax.swing.BoxLayout import javax.swing.event.TreeExpansionEvent import javax.swing.event.TreeWillExpandListener import javax.swing.tree.DefaultMutableTreeNode import javax.swing.tree.DefaultTreeModel import javax.swing.tree.ExpandVetoException import javax.swing.tree.MutableTreeNode import javax.swing.tree.TreePath import java.awt.event.ActionListener import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import javax.swing.JTextPane  public class TreeSSCCE extends JFrame implements TreeWillExpandListener   private static final long serialVersionUID  1930472429779070045L  public static void mainString[] args       SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable          public void run              TreeSSCCE inst  new TreeSSCCE             inst.setLocationRelativeTonull             inst.setVisibletrue             inst.setDefaultCloseOperationEXITONCLOSE                            private DefaultMutableTreeNode rootNode private JTree tree private DefaultTreeModel treeModel private TreePath selectionPathPriorToNewData private EnumerationltTreePathgt expandedPathsPriorToNewData private int treeSize  5  public TreeSSCCE       this.setBounds0, 0, 500, 400     JPanel mainPanel  new JPanel     getContentPane.addmainPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER     mainPanel.setBounds0, 0, 500, 400     mainPanel.setLayoutnew BoxLayoutmainPanel, BoxLayout.YAXIS      JPanel descriptionPanel  new JPanel     descriptionPanel.setBounds0, 0, 500, 200     mainPanel.adddescriptionPanel      JTextPane textPane  new JTextPane     String newLine  System.getPropertyline.separator     descriptionPanel.setLayoutnew BorderLayout0, 0     textPane.setTextStart by expanding some nodes then click Add New Data and you will notice that the tree state is not retained.     descriptionPanel.addtextPane       Initialize The Tree     tree  new JTree     rootNode  new DefaultMutableTreeNodeRoot     treeModel  new DefaultTreeModelrootNode     tree.addTreeWillExpandListenerthis     tree.setModeltreeModel     tree.setShowsRootHandlestrue     populateTreefalse      JScrollPane scrollPane  new JScrollPanetree     mainPanel.addscrollPane      JPanel buttonPanel  new JPanel     mainPanel.addbuttonPanel      JButton btnAddNewData  new JButtonAdd New Data     btnAddNewData.addActionListenernew ActionListener          public void actionPerformedActionEvent arg0              addNewDataToTree                   buttonPanel.addbtnAddNewData     private void removeAllTreeNodes       whiletreeModel.isLeaftreeModel.getRoot              treeModel.removeNodeFromParentMutableTreeNodetreeModel.getChildtreeModel.getRoot,0          treeModel  null     treeModel  new DefaultTreeModelrootNode     tree.setModeltreeModel   public void restoreExpansionStateEnumeration enumeration      if enumeration  null               while enumeration.hasMoreElements                       TreePath treePath  TreePath enumeration.nextElement             tree.expandPathtreePath             tree.setSelectionPathtreePath                  tree.setSelectionPathselectionPathPriorToNewData        protected void addNewDataToTree        save the tree state     selectionPathPriorToNewData  tree.getSelectionPath     expandedPathsPriorToNewData  tree.getExpandedDescendantsnew TreePathtree.getModel.getRoot     removeAllTreeNodes     populateTreetrue     restoreExpansionStateexpandedPathsPriorToNewData   private void populateTreeboolean newData      ifnewData         treeSize     MyParentNode[] parents  new MyParentNode[treeSize]     forint i  0 i lt treeSize i              parents[i]  new MyParentNodeParent [  i  ]         treeModel.insertNodeIntoparents[i], rootNode, i        Override public void treeWillCollapseTreeExpansionEvent evt throws ExpandVetoException       Not used.

Negative 15167 pI would like to store files on a shared web server but would like to hide the content of the file.

Negative 15167 pI am attempting to create a multithreaded Sieve of Eratosthenesp  pThe number of threads are set by default to 4, though they can be specified by the user as a command line argument.p  pIm attempting to mark all intervals of the prime within the array concurrently with several different threads.  So, the array containing 0 or 1 is split into arrayElementsthreadNumber.p  pEach thread has a specified starting position and ending position of the array for it to check for intervals of the prime within.  p  pSo, for instance lets assume that the number you want to go up to is 20, and you have 4 threads.  Thread 0 will start at 0 and go up to 2041.  The next will start at 204threadNumber, and go up to 204nextThreadNumber1 and so on.p  pI then have to check to see if the prime that was found is within the array area of one of the threads.  This is because if it IS, that prime CANNOT be marked as nonprime.  I was having a problem because the primes, after out of the bounds of the first thread, would be marked as nonprime because the prime number divides itself.  p  pAs you can see below, I find if the startingPosition is divisible by the prime.  If it is, I set that as that threads nonPrime seeking starting point, and increment by the prime from there, marking each instance within range as nonprime.  If it isnt, then I calculate what the next nonprime is based off the prime number and put that as the start.p  pAt the end of all this, its your usual Loop through the array in intervals of primeNumber, marking each instance as nonprime.  p  pLong story short, I have to get this working with numbers up to the range of a 32 bit integer Which is 2billion or so.  It works fine with smaller numbers, but after doing some benchmarking tests at 1.4 million numbers it takes 13.4 seconds. For 5.4 million it takes 37.3 seconds.  For 10 million it takes 68 seconds. For the 2billion, it just keeps working Ive let it run for 10 minutes or more with no end in sight.p  pSo, how can I improve my code  What is causing it to take so long  It doesnt seem to be any faster than a single threaded implementation I set the thread argument to 1 for single threaded, and it takes 56 seconds for 10 million numbersp  pSo, here is the code, with p  pdefine maxNum 10483646p  pThreaded functionp  precode   int numThreads number of threads     int innerCounter     int composite[maxNum]   need to find all prime numbers up to unsigned 32 bit integer creating n threads, start to 1n 1 0,  1n to 2n 1 , 2n to 3n 1 until its n1n to nn are starting positions for looking for primes so threads arent accessing same area void markPrimesint i     Prime number should be innerCounter     printfThreaded process dn, i     starting position in array maxNumthreadNum  i     ending position in array maxNumthreadNum  i1  1     int startingPosition     int compositeCounter     int firstNonPrime     int endingPosition     int primeInRange           startingPosition  doublemaxNumnumThreads  i         endingPosition  doublemaxNumnumThreads  i11         ifi  numThreads1             endingPosition  maxNum                   ifstartingPosition lt innerCounter ampamp innerCounter lt endingPosition the prime number is in range, and should be ignored             primeInRange  1                   firstNonPrime  startingPositioninnerCounter         iffirstNonPrime  0             int temp  innerCounter  firstNonPrime             firstNonPrime  temp  startingPosition         else             firstNonPrime  startingPosition                  ifprimeInRange  1             firstNonPrime  innerCounter  innerCounter               iffirstNonPrime lt endingPosition           forcompositeCounter  firstNonPrime compositeCounter lt endingPosition compositeCounter  innerCounter                          composite[compositeCounter]  1                                return void0  codepre  pAnd now the main function which has the rest of the algorithm and creates the threadsp  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]      clockt start start time     clockt stop end time     double totaltime     int rc     int nextNum     int prevNum  0     int i     int numPrimes     unsigned int maxNum  INTMAX maximum unsigned integer value to go up until     bit array for threads to check primes for     fori  0 i lt maxNum1 i         composite[i]  0          ifargc gt 1         numThreads  atoiargv[1] argument given for n number of threads     else         numThreads  4 default if no argument given is 4 threads          pthreadt threads[numThreads] array of threads     start  clock start timing      Sieve algorithm here When prime found, spawn threads     int outerCounter  1     whileouterCounter lt sqrtmaxNum         searching numbers above the current for prime numbers          forinnerCounter  outerCounter1 innerCounter lt maxNum innerCounter             not composite              ifcomposite[innerCounter]  0                 setting all multiples of innerCounter to 1, creating threads to split up the work                  fori  0 i lt numThreads i                      rc  pthreadcreateampthreads[i], NULL, markPrimes, void i                      Detecting Error                     ifrc                         perrorThread creation error                         exit1                                                       fori  1 i lt numThreads i                     pthreadjointhreads[i], NULL                                  outerCounter  innerCounter                 numPrimes                                  stop  clock stop timing     totaltime  doublestop  start  CLOCKSPERSEC       printfTime for threads .5fn, totaltime     printfNumber of primes dn, numPrimes1      return 0  codepre  pI thank you all in advance for your patience and assistancep  pEdit I must use pthreadsp  pEdit 2 I used a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1606400howtosleeporpauseapthreadinconlinuxHow to sleep or pause a PThread in c on Linuxa as an example to try and guide some conditional locking and unlocking.

Negative 15167 pI created a program that finds the median of a list of numbers. The list of numbers is dynamic in that numbers can be removed and inserted duplicate numbers can be entered and during this time, the new median is reevaluated and printed out. p  pI created this program using a multimap because p  p1 the benefit of it being already being sorted,br  2 easy insertion, deletion, searching since multimap implements binary searchbr  3 duplicate entries are allowed. p  pThe constraints for the number of entries  deletions represented as N are 0 lt N lt 100,000. p  pThe program I wrote works and prints out the correct median, but it isnt fast enough. I know that the unsortedmultimap is faster than multimap, but then the problem with unsortedmultimap is that I would have to sort it. I have to sort it because to find the median you need to have a sorted list. So my question is, would it be practical to use an unsortedmultimap and then quick sort the entries, or would that just be ridiculous Would it be faster to just use a vector, quicksort the vector, and use a binary search Or maybe I am forgetting some fabulous solution out there that I havent even thought of. p  pThough Im not new to C, I will admit, that my skills with timecomplexity are somewhat medicore.p  hr  pThe more I look at my own question, the more Im beginning to think that just using  a vector with quicksort and binary search would be better since the data structures basically already implement vectors. p

Negative 15167 pHow do I properly aggregate results in a view using node.js amp mongoose from mongodb. My programmer colleague came up with the following route to aggregate event and blog posts in one listview of content sorted by day if both published and promoted equal 1. The trouble with this is that the list of aggregate results is really just split into two first events display, then blogs display when they should render in a truly mixed fashion sorted by date. I would use a join or groupby in mysql but how would I do this type of aggregation in a node.js app with mongodb Ps, were using express and mongoose in case that helps.p  pUpdate Weve already defined the schema for the two events and blogs, and there are thousands of records already stored. So the question now is, can we do this client side or do we have to create an index another collection Im reading up on mongodbs aggregation framework and map reduce as well but Im not sure if either of those can help me at this point.p  precode    app.getpromotedcontentpage, userSession, functionreq, res, next  var today  todayTimestamp  var limit  10 ifreq.params.page      var skip  req.params.page  limit  else      var skip  0   async.parallel     blogs functioncallback         app.Blog.find             .wherestatus.equals1             .wherepromote.equals1             .sortsticky, 1             .sortcreated, 1             .populateuserId             .execfunctionerr, blogs                  if err                      console.logerr                  else                      callbacknull, blogs                               ,     events functioncallback         app.Event.find             .wherestatus.equals1             .wherepromote.equals1             .sortsticky, 1             .sortcreated, 1             .populateuserId             .execfunctionerr, events                  if err                      console.logerr                  else                      callbacknull, events                                ,  callback function to render page and pass in all data functionerr, results      add type field to results for logic in mixed output     fori  0 i lt results.blogs.length i          results.blogs[i].type  blog          fori  0 i lt results.events.length i          results.events[i].type  event           combine results from blogs and events and sort the results     var promoted  results.events.concatresults.blogs     var outputted  false     promoted.sortfunction a, b              Sort by key of modification date in each array       if  a[changed]  b[changed]  return 0       return a[changed] lt b[changed]  1  1           create a subset     var subset  new Array     forvar i  skip i lt limit  skip i          subset.pushpromoted[i]           check mobile     ifisMobilereq          res.rendermobilefragmentsblockposts,  posts subset, user req.session.user, message req.flash      else          res.renderfragmentsblockposts,  posts subset, user req.session.user, message req.flash       codepre
Negative 15167 pIm trying to program an implementation of the RSA algorithm. For that I need to compute modular exponentiations with very big numbers in PHP. For example cd Mod n, where c,d,n are about 1024 bits long. This works with bcpowmod, but the runtime is very bad. The computation of one such number needs about 23 secs. In Java with BigInteger and in JavaScript with an equal implementation of BigInteger the same step needs ca. 0.04 secs. Is there another way in PHP, or how else could I do this serverside This is the code in PHPp  precodec  alongnumber d  alongnumber n  alongnumber m  bcpowmodc,d,n codepre  pThanks in advancep

Negative 15167 pSometimes eclipse will randomly stop responding, for seemingly no reason. The process cannot be killed through any means, anything that tries to kill it will stop responding, and wont be able to be killed either. It even prevents Windows from logging off. The ONLY way to kill it is to hard shutdown the computer. I have tried task manager, logging off, and taskkill with Image Name and PID. No idea whats causing this, need help.p

Negative 15167 pI have an tabbed application that captures data, stores it using NSUserDefaults and presents a readout in a table that is contained in a UIViewController. I am using a navigation controller between the tab view controller and the data view. The data view is then connected to a history view controller which is a child view controller. The history also has a table.p  pWhen you press a row in the history view, the app is supposed to transition back to the data view and present the readout for the history. This is done by making the data the first NSUserDefault which is then presented in the data view. THe transition I am using isp  precode[self.navigationController popToRootViewControllerAnimatedYES] codepre  pThis transitions back to the data view successfully however it does not change the data in the view. However,when I remove that code and press the row and then press back, the readout is changed. How do I make the readout change on press of the rowp

I want horizontal layout lines in a horizontallyscrolling collection view.p  pI also dont have any inherent sections in my model  this is just a single set of items. I could group them into sections, but the collection view is resizable, so the number of items that can fit on a page would change sometimes, and it seems like the choice of which page each item goes on is better left to the layout than to the model if I dont have any meaningful sections.p  pSo, can I do this with Flow Layout, or do I need to create a custom layoutp

Negative 15167 pI recently installed OPAM as per instructions to give it a try and it looks nice and Id like to use it. However, it fails to detect previously installed OCAML packages that I installed manually before I choose to give OPAM a try. p  pThe first thing OPAM wants to do for any package installation now is to install ocamlfind. Querying for info about packages I installed manually do not reflect that they are already installed. This includes ocamlfind.p  pIm afraid to do anything as I have no idea what effect it might have to install another package. OPAM will overwrite or reinstall ocamlfind at the very least. Would this clobber my existing ocamlfind and its knowledge of all the packages I already manually installed and my ability to use them I dont want to have to reinstall everything all over again. Ive searched and searched but cannot find any documentation or forum posts about this precise topic and I dont know exactly how ocamlfind works under the hood.p  pAt the very least it would be nice if OPAM could either detect, or be told, which packages already exist and where they reside to avoid needless recompilation. Maybe it already does this but Ive not been able to discover if it does.p

Negative 15167 pI use TFS for my project and I have set up gated checkin. I changed one of the interfaces and I made the changes to the class that implements it as well. Then tried to check in, but I received a message that says build failed. Error was [class] doesnt implement the interface member [interface]. Then I tried to build it on my local machine and everything succeeded. I tried to checkin again, but it failed again. p  pSo I found the problem later, that the interface I made was in the list of files that going to be checkin, but the class I made changes was in excluded list. That cause the build to fail. I am sure that when I checkin on solution level not just the interface.p  pMy question is why that class was in excluded list Did anyone else had this issue beforep  pThanks for the help   p
Negative 15167 pFor a Java class I am taking, I need to use sockets to pass data back and forth between client and server.  While I can get examples to work passing string data, I need to be able to pass custom class objects i.e. a product and lists of these objects back and forth.  I cannot get the server piece to successfully read the input.  I tried to create a simple example of my code to see if anyone can pinpoint the issue.  I do understand that I dont have the code complete, but I cannot even get the server to read the object the the class is writing to the stream in this case, I am writing a string just in an attempt to get it to work, but need to readwrite objects.

Negative 15167 pI have 2 audio .wav files recorded by the the same person with the same word. Each audio file has a format of 16bit, 44.1kHz and is a mono channel. I would like to know how to compare these 2 audio files if it is by the same person. What I know is to process the files to produce a floating point result of values between 1 and 1 and apply fft on it  and compare the frequency. What I would like to know is how to compare the pcm of the audio files, prefably with the  code which shows the comparison and if possible the steps before thatprocessing to become values btw 1 and 1.Thanks. Im relatively new in this area so I would appreciate If u guys would help me out. Im currently using a metro application in vs. I would prefer not to use any library like naudio or bass.net but I would still accept any answer.br A step by step solution starting from utilizing the .wav file is much appreciated.

Negative 15167 pWere using Flex 4.6 for the current project, and I decided I wanted to put some buttons on the righthand edge of the screen that essentially just looked like simple tabs, hence having a symmetrical trapezoidal shape.  The problem  I understand why Flex wouldnt have trapezoids built in, but its apparently neither are triangles, and implementing a triangle in Flex is evidently just unnatural.p  pTo implement these buttons, the two main options I see arep  p1 Inherit from Image and embed some pngs with transparent backgrounds or something.p  p2 Inherit from Group, let the rectangular part of the button be a Rect, and let the triangular parts each be a collection of 1width Lines.p  pWhich would be more efficient  Which would be better in general  I know these approaches are unnatural, but despite the issues Im seeing with Flex, is there a Flexstyle way of handling this thats better  Thanksp

Negative 15167 pCurrently we have a development cloud services acmedevservice and a production cloud service acmeprodservice. Our current setup in our solution has a cloud service project called acme.application that uses transformation of the .cscfg and .csdef files for deploying the project to the two environments production and development. I dont like the transformation method because it feels like a bit of a hack to me. So after doing some research it seems that you can have multiple configuration files which solves some of the issue but I am running into problems because you are only allowed one service definition. This doesnt work for us because the production environment requires extra certificates as well as different hostHeader  bindings than our dev environment does.p  pSo it seems we cant really get away from using the transformations. So I guess my question boils down to am I looking at the Azure Service Project files in the wrong light Should we really be mapping one Azure Project to one Azure cloud service Should I have an Azure project for Production and a second Azure Project for Development Is there a better way to do this Or a best practice for working with multiple environments in Azurep

Negative 15167 pI would like to create a variety of simple no selfintersection, independent polygons all with the same area I will do it multiple times with different areas, but with different perimeter lengths. I guess ideally I would have a factorial design with 10 areas each with 1020 polygons of varying edgearea ratios 100200 total polygons. I suppose that the 10 polygons could be generated for 1 area and then a multiplier could be used to increasedecrease the total size of each one for the 10 different area replicates. In reality the shapes dont have to have straight sides, but I figured that would be easier. The polygon doesnt have to be convex, the angles could be highly variable and the shapes irregular, but they dont have to be. The benefit of highly irregular polygons as opposed to rectangles with different length sides, for example is the ability to generate polygons with a larger range of perimeterarea ratios.p  pI am doing this for comparing landscapes with forest harvests of different sizes and shapes I will eventually apply a function to calculate wildlife abundance for each polygon. Any working solution would do, but solutions using R, Python, andor GIS ArcGIS or QGIS would be preferred. Thanks for any thoughts or suggestions.p
Negative 15167 pI am developing a plugin that using mongodb. The plugin has to store some .dcm files DICOM files in the database as binary files. After that, the plugin has to store the metadata of the file and be able to make some query on only these metadata.p  pNaturally, I chose GridFs to answer at my problem. Because I can use the same file to store the binary data in the chunks collection and the metadata in the metadata field in the files collection and bypass the sized limit of MongoDB.p  pBut another problem comes to me. This solution would be great but I am storing at the same time the binary data and the metadata. Let me explain  first I store the binary file and after that I retrieve the file and read metadata from it and store the metadata in the same file. It is an obligation for me for some externals reasons. So I lost a lot of time to retrieve the file and restore it again. For update the metadata from a file that it is already stored, I am using this code p  precode    GridFSDBFile file  saveFs.findOneuri.getFileName     if file  null          return false      else          file.setMetaDatanew BasicDBObject         file.save         return true      codepre  pThe main problem it that I have to find the file before to modify it and then store it AGAIN p  pstrongSo my first question is  Is there a best way to retrieve file from the database instead of findOneString fileName  Is the method findOneObjectID id is faster  I dont think so because I think that fileName is already indexed by default, is not it strongp  pI have tried another way to do it. To bypass this problem, I decided to store 2 different files, ones for binary data and ones for metadata. In this case, I dont loose time to retrieve the file in the database. But I have got 2 times more files... But I almost sure that it exist a better way to do it p  pstrongSo my second question  Do you think that I would have to used 2 different collections  One which used GridFs to store the binary data and the other one that used classic mongo storage or GridFS to only store the metada strongp  pThank you a lot for reading me and for your answer .p

Negative 15167 pI am trying to reduce the stack size for a python script in order to produce more threads. I am setting it like thisp  precodethreading.stacksize32768 codepre  pAnd putting it at the import level, before any threads get started The problem is that, it has no effect. With or without it, i can start the exact number of threads. I am using Python 2.7 x86 on a Windows 7 machine x64, over 2.4GB RAM available.p  pAny thoughts on why it has no effect  I am really looking for a solution, rather than comments on the number of threads I need to spawn.p  pI suspect it has to do with the .pyc files related to threading, I remember i faced this situation where deleting thoose .pyc files and letting python recompile them on the next run would apply the changes, but I do not know what files to temper with regarding threading.p  pWould appreciate any help I can get.p  pP.S. Please do not recommend using Twisted or Asyncore, I know they are better, but I need to make the best of it regarding the current situation, rather than to redesign the entire code.p

Negative 15167 pI am looking for a good way to share my translations between my Symfony2 App and my Angular.JS App, they are essentially the same app, however they act very differently.p  pFirst of all I have made a directive to allow for templating using [[ variable ]] in my angular js app, so I can use the variables from twig alongside my variables in angular.p  pSo what I want to achieve is to translate my sentences into the localisation that the user prefers.p  pSo my conclusion is that I want to use the translations features of Symfony, as there is no good support for that in Angular. I also want to use all the built in features that Symfony includes, which is like update the files automatically, support YAML etc. But I need to work out how to transfer them to my JS application and how I can detect them in Symfony, so both applications can use them.p  pSo my initial ideap  pstrongChange the capturing of translations or at least add an additional one to the scope.strongp  pcode trans Hello [[name]] endtrans codep  pcodelttrans nameMy Name translationHello [[name]] gtcodep  pAnd also support all other functionalities with pluralisation etc.p  pThis would then generate a file that has the translations, and pluralisation etc.p  pstrongRequest language through angular ajax call and save this into a local storage on the client side.strongp  pThis would allow me to replace the directive above of trans with the proper value. This is not a problem to set up. However it needs to be exported from whatever format to JSON that angular can read.p  pThen there needs to be a matcher, and there needs to be support for pluralisation and all other features available.p  pstrongOther Ideasstrongp  pIt might be better in general to not use the Symfony2 translations when you do an Angular.JS App, and thereby only use the angular translations, otherwise the text written in Symfony2 Twigs and is translated would probably not be translatable in Angular. But the generation of these files I find it to be better if Symfony could capture and spit out.p  pI think this needs to be a bit of work to be solid, but I feel that this needs to be solved. Any ideas and helpful comments are appreciated, I am considering to start a project for this on GitHub, to give proper support for this. But if theres such already it might just be better to work with that.p  pMarcusp

If I hover over this data, I need to show a tooltip, this tooltip shows information retrieved by server REST.

Negative 15167 pI dont understand why this works in javap  pIf I have an Integer object in a object, examplep  precodeObject myIntObj  new Integer5 codepre  pNow if i dop  precodeSystem.out.printlnmyIntObj codepre  pthe output is code5codep  pI now that the Integer class has an ovveride of the toString method but in this case is different I think. For the polymorphism, if I have a child object in a father variable the object doesnt change its real type in this case Integer But... it in the Object variable can just use the method of the Object Class, so why if I writep  precodeSystem.out.printlnmyIntObj codepre  pI can see directly the number 5 and not the reference of this object Because toString method in the object class by default return just a string of the reference of the object.p  plikep  precodeObject currentPlayer  new Player System.out.printlncurrentPlayer codepre  pIn this case the output is the reference of the Player objecet because is called the toString method in the object class.p  pSo why in the example of before I dont see the reference but directly the number by logic, the rules of the polymorphism says that if u have a child object in a father variable, this object, inside, remanis the same but he is used like an istance of object, so he can just uses the class object and so just the method of object, so is really strange that I dont see the reference but directly the number.p  pI hope you understand what I mean.p

Negative 15167 pFirst I should preface this by saying that Im quite new to FlashASp  pLong story short, Im working on a very basic quiz game in Flash. The user will be presented with questions and must choose an answer to proceed whether they choose the right or wrong answer.p  pThis will be used as a training tool at my work, and we need to be able to track users answers to determine what people got rightwrong, who needs additional training, etc.p  pMy initial thought is to utilize SharedObjects to gather their answers since SO are userspecific, this seemed to make sense. My question though, is there a way to access the SO data and send an email, export a text file or something to the managers Possibly store the clicks in an array and export thatp  pThe other thing is that we dont want people to be able to retake the quiz theres an incentive for getting 90 questions right. My other thought was that I could write some data to the SO once the user reaches the endscreen and can be checked against at login to see if theyve already finished the game.p  pAnyways, thats the problem Im running into. If emailingexporting SO data isnt an option, what other options are therep

Negative 15167 pAfter reading a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRolebasedaccesscontrol relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRolebasedaccesscontrola and seeing the way people are building authorizationaccess control, this question came to my mind Why we are checking roles of users when checking if they are permitted to do X rather than checking their permissionsp  pThis is what I understood, Users have Roles, Roles have permission and this is how a user can have permissions A user cannot explicitly have permissions assigned to it, it gets its permission by having rolesp  pAnd I think it makes sense to check for a permission like AddUser when processing a request for adding a user but in .Net library and also in a lot of examples in RBAC we see that they check for Roles. Like they check if the user is in the role of Administrators rather than checking if heshe has the permission AddUser.p  pWhy It kind of makes more sense to me to check for permissions.p  pCan someone please illuminate me herep  pThanksp

Negative 15167 pIve created Widget system where a widget can be placed in any ZoneRegion on any page. A Widget is  a model that inherit from ClassMapping.

Negative 15167 pI am just new to reading in an XML file into a table through SQL Server Management Studio. There are probably better ways but I would like to use this approach.p  pCurrently I am reading in a standard XML file of records on people. A codeltrecordgtcode tag is the highest level of each row of data. I want to read all the records into separate rows into my SQL table.p  pI have gotten along fine so far using the following approach as followsp  precodeSELECT          Record         category, editor, entered, subcategory, uid, updated,          Person         firstname, lastname, ssn, ei, title, POSITION, FROM OPENXMLhDoc, recordsrecordpersonnames WITH        Record     category [varchar]100 ....category,     editor [varchar]100 ....editor,     entered Datetime ....entered,     subcategory [varchar]100 ....subcategory,     uid BIGINT ....uid,     updated [varchar]100 ....updated,      Person     firstname [varchar]100 firstname,     lastname [varchar]100 lastname,     ssn [varchar]100 ..ssn,     ei [varchar]100 ..ei,     title [varchar]100 ..title,     Position [varchar]100 ..position,    codepre  pHowever this approach has worked fine as the tag names have all been unique to each recordperson. The issue I have is within the codeltPersongtcode tag I now have an codeltAliasesgtcode tag that contains a list of more than 1 codeltAliasgt test name ltAliasgtcode tags. If I use the above approach amp reference strong..aliasesstrong I get all the Alias elements as one long String row mixed together. If I just try strong..aliasesaliasstrong ONLY the first element is returned per record row. If there was 10 Alias elements within the Aliases tag set I would like 10 rows returned for example. p  pIs there a way to specify that when there are multiple tags of the same name within a higher level tag, return them all amp not just one rowp  pThe following is the example block within the XML I am referring top  precode ltaliasesgt   ltaliasgttest 1ltaliasgt    ltaliasgttest 2ltaliasgt    ltaliasgttest 3ltaliasgt    ltaliasesgt codepre  pI would like the following in the SQL tablep  precodeRecord               Aliases  Record 1             test 1 Record 1             test 2 Record 1             test 3 Record 2             test 4 Record 2             test 5 codepre  pbut all I get isp  precodeRecord 1             test 1  Record 2             test 4 codepre  pApologies if I have not explained this correctly  any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 15167 pi am currently going through some tutorials on android development and libgdxscene2d atm but got stuck on the toucheventsp  pFor starters i am implementing a board game. By now i managed to draw the board and some meeples player tokens as well as adjust their position to the correct coordinates. When i started using libgdx i also successfully implemented a first test to see if the touchinput is working. The test looked something like thisp  precodeifGdx.input.isTouched         touchPos.setGdx.input.getX, Gdx.input.getY, 0         camera.unprojecttouchPos         stone.xtouchPos.x  stone.width2         stone.ytouchPos.y  stone.height2 codepre  pBy now i rearranged my code to use scene2d because of some very convenient features. However it seems like i cant manage to get touchevents to work with scene2d despite i followed some rather simple tutorials. Since some of them reference some recent major changes to scene2d, i wondered if those tutorials might be outdated and hope you guys can help me fix my problem  I will try and only paste the relevant parts of my code in here to present a minimal example of my nonworking code.  Of course i am also glad about any hints on how to improve my code in general since i am still learning and probably break some conventions here p  pLets start with my actorclassp  precodedeleted imports  public class Player extends Actor     private int xval x Position of the Player on the board     private int yval y Position of the Player on the board     private Color color     private TextureRegion playerTexture     deleted some variables that are unimportant for touchevents      public Playerint x, int y, TextureRegion texture         initializing some Variables with default values             this.xval  x             this.yval  y             color  new Color1,1,1,1              playerTexture  texture             this.setTouchableTouchable.enabled this should be set by default, but i added it just to be sure.          setBounds seems to be necessary in addition to the touchable flag to be able to grab or touch Actors.         getX and getY are methods of the actor class which i do not overwrite. I use distinct getters and setters to modify the Variables xval and yval.             setBoundsgetX, getY, playerTexture.getRegionWidth, playerTexture.getRegionHeight           now i implement the InputListener. This doesnt seem to get called, since the touch started message doesnt appear in LogCat.         In Theory the testevent should move the meeple one space to the right.          To do that i call event.getTarget which returns the actor of which the TouchDown is called. I then cast it to my Actor class Player and set xval to xval1.             this.addListenernew InputListener             public boolean touchDownInputEvent event, float x, float y, int pointer, int buttons                 Gdx.app.logExample, touch started at   x  ,   y                   Playerevent.getTarget.setXfPlayerevent.getTarget.getXf1                 return true                                         This is my draw method, which just sets the color of my meeple and then draws it to its current position.     public void drawBatch batch, float alpha         batch.setColorcolor         batch.drawplayerTexture, getX, getY                 deleted several getters and setters  codepre  pSo if i got it right, the gdx inputProcessor is managing all inputs. If i set the Gdx InputProcessor to the stage which contains the actors, it will in case of an event for example a touchDown call the inputProcessors of all actors on the stage. Thus since i just added one to my class which includes a touchDown, this should handle the touchDown event in the case that the actor is actually touched. The hitbox to verify that is set by the statement setBounds in my Player class.p  pI implemented this in my ApplicationListener classp  precodedeleted imports  public class QuoridorApplicationListener implements ApplicationListener      Stage stage     OrthographicCamera camera     deleted several variable declarations.             deleted constructor  this only fills some of my variables with values depending on game settings.      Override     public void create          set stage  since stage  new Stage800,400,false doesnt seem to work anymore, i did set up a viewport manually. If you got suggestions how to this straightforward, please leave a note          Gdx.app.logTag, game started         camera  new OrthographicCamera         camera.setToOrthofalse, 800, 480         Viewport viewport  new Viewport          viewport.setCameracamera         stage  new Stageviewport         Gdx.input.setInputProcessorstage like i described above, this should forward incoming touchevents to the actors on the stage.          deleted setting textures, music, setting up the board the boardtiles are actors which are added to the stage           deleted setting TextureRegion, player colors, player positions and player attributes.             for int i  0 i lt playercount i                 stage.addActorplayers[i]                        deleted dispose, pause, resume, resize methods.

So i hope you can help me  Thanks a lot in advancep

Negative 15167 pIm a rails newbie building my first application.

Negative 15167 pIm having a problem with the screen recording in Android. Im looking for a way to record the screen. The approach Im looking for must fulfill the following requirementsp  pa It can have ROOT. I read a lot of the threads here and I think it should be easier with root. So this is no limiting factor for me. p  pb It should work on Tegra2 or Tegra3 devices such as the Nexus 7. Thus, frame buffering approaches will not give the expected result to me. p  pc It should be able to record the full screen in background using a service. So, it should not be limited to my own application.p  pd It should be run on the device only. So, no connecting to PC should be necessary. p  pWhat I tried so farp  p1 I tried to use the amazing new screen record feature of Android 4.4. So I gained root rights and executed the command from within my application. This works fine, but the approach has two problemsp  pi I did not find a way to stop the current recording.p  pii The recording is limited to 3 minutes. I need at least 10 minutes. p  p2 I implemented an approach which takes screenshots while the service is running and stores them in a folder on the sdcard. This is done by using the codesystembinscreencap pcode command. However, this approach is really slow. It only achieves to make a screenshot every second, such I only would get an FPS rate of 1. However, my goal is not to achieve an FPS rate of 30. 68 FPS would be sufficient. Moreover, I did not find a way to encode the .png files as a video. p  pOn the APP store I found an application SCR Screen Recorder which is able to do exactly the thing Im looking for. So, I think it is possible. However, my app should be able to do it without requiring additional apps. Thus, an Intent is no option for me.p  pBest regards, misterviperp  pstrongUPDATE 1strong So Im now able to start and stop the screenrecording for Android 4.4 programatically. Here it is important to not KILL the screenrecord process using the standard kill command. You have to use the codekill SIGINT ltpidgtcode command  otherwise you get and coruppted video file. The PID of the screen record process can be get by calling codeps screenrecordcode and then doing some processing on the resulting string. Now I only need an approach for merging all the video files programmatically. p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Finally, I also managed the last part. First, I use a Timer and a TimerTask which allow me to start a new screenrecording every 3 minutes until the user hits stop. Using the solution described in Update1, I them stop the recording. After doing the complete recording I start a postprocessing step. In this step I use the mp4parser library to merge the video files into a single one. The answer for that was also available here on stackoverflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13514317howtoconcatormergetwoormorevideofilesinandroidclicka.p  pThank you all for your answers. Under the requirements of root access and Android 4.4 I now have a running screenrecording. For my purposes this is fine. However, I think there are enough developers which have other requirements. So feel free to answer here, if you have further ideas.   p

Negative 15167 pIm working on a simple slider for a website. Obviously its a work in progress and I havent completed the script or the styling, but I have run into an issue. By clicking on the next button Im able to loop through all of the images, but when I reach the end and try to get it to go back to the first one, the dataslide attribute for all of them resets to 0 and all the slides display.

Negative 15167 pstrongMy use casestrong buyer buys service from seller, our app facilitates and guaranties the  transaction. It should work in the way that buyer sends the money to us, we check if buyer received the service, in that case we send the money to seller. Otherwise we refund the buyer. Important is to have 2 payments solutions for the buyer paypal account and card payment without account. The whole use case is international. Im testing this in sandbox environment.p  pPossible solutionsp  ol lipAdaptive payments  Delayed chained payments Works fine. Disadvantage is that the seller must grant us permission so that the refund works. The problem here is that the permission api is under maintenance, so i am waiting for all the changes a hrefhttpsdeveloper.paypal.comdocsclassicpermissionsserviceintegrationguidePermissionsWhatsNew relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.paypal.comdocsclassicpermissionsserviceintegrationguidePermissionsWhatsNewa . Is this big dealpli lipExpress checkout AuthorizeCapture  Mass Pay Works OK. Advantage here is that in case of refund void after authorize we dont have to pay the fee. Disadvantage here is that Im not sure if authorize holds the funds, so that even buyer without account paying with card cannot touch the money and I can capture them in 3 days. Another issue is that when I authorize 40 from PayPal account with 30 balance, I capture the whole 40. How comepli ol  pI have no previous experience with PayPal I now the app should work on international scale. Please if you have any tips, articles or practical experience with this use case share itp  hr  pstrongEDITstrong Delayed Chained Payment is great.

Is canvas a good choice  I chose canvas because the coordinates should be absolute and doesnt change when window or object is resized the newly drawn lines should not delete the previous drawn line or the background Sorry or my bad English and I hope u can guide me with something to start with. p

Negative 15167 pThis might be a bit of a naive question but in my loading ViewController, I am loading all the content that the app needs using a a set of methods like getEachItem below. This is usually like 2 or 3 items and they are all written to a cache. Id like to call the method showNavigation that runs after the final instance of getEachItem has completed but not sure how to do this. getEachItem does a GET request with AFNetworking.  Something like a jQuery complete block but for the totality of the below for loopp  precodeNSArray tmpItems[result objectForKeyipaditems] forNSDictionary m in tmpItems    will also increment into the menus array   [self getEachItem[m objectForKeyid]]   [self getImages[m objectForKeyid]]  [self showNavigation] codepre  pthx for any helpp
Negative 15167 pIs there a PHP code to automatically download a csv file from a link of a different website I go to this 3rd party website daily to download list of closing properties in a certain state. The county website offers a link which when you click will download a csv file. I am in the process of building a PHP page where it reads the contents of that csv file into a table but I was thinking maybe theres a way to automate the download as wellp  pI checked on the links URL by doing a COPY LINK URL and although the list changes daily, I dont think the download links URL is also dynamic.p

Negative 15167 pI have a Perl tied hash which uses the a hrefhttpsmetacpan.orgpodSDBMFile relnofollowcodeSDBMFilecodea module and I need to do some character encoding conversions when storing or fetching values.p  pI followed the a hrefhttpsmetacpan.orgpoddistributionperlpodperldbmfilter.pod relnofollowdocumentation of codeperldbmfiltercodea and in general it seems to work I get the results from the hash properly encoded like expected, and it stores the byte values for my encoding in the file, which I check using a hex editor.p  pWhat is not working is any kind of iteration over all elements of the hash, either using codekeyscode, or codeeachcode, or things like codeDataDumpercode, or even a simple copy operation to another hash.p  pWhat I always get is an infinite recursion. It seems like the iterator never gets to its end, and if I use codeeachcode and print the iterated values they are repeated.p  pI hunted the problem down to the use of codefilterfetchkeycode and the charset conversion Im doing there. If I comment out codefilterfetchkeycode, or if I change the filter method to do just codereturn shiftcode, then the iteration works again. Either of these solves my problem, but I need to use codefilterfetchkeycode to send the caller properlyencoded strings.p  precodedbmgtfilterfetchkey  sub    selfgtnormalizeCharset   sub normalizeCharset    my self  shift  Carpcroak...    return shift   return ...windows2utfshift  codepre  pIf I uncomment codereturn shiftcode, the iteration works but commented like above it doesnt. I guess it has something to do what happens to codecode, but I have no idea, as codewindows2utfcode just copies the given data and does some character encoding. This works the same way for storing keys and values and even for fetching values. Only keys are the problem and only if I do an iteration, not if I directly ask for specific keys.p  pAny hints on what Im doing wrongp  pTheres a thread on a hrefhttpwww.perlmonks.orgnodeid1099905 relnofollowcodePerlmonkscodea as well.p

Negative 15167 pI am responsible for a project that uses Django1.7c and PostgreSQL 8.4.20. The project consists of one django app named db I know this is not really meaningful name, but I can not help it. Due to some changes in project requirements I needed to perform some database migrations and among many other operations I wanted to migrate some model lets call it Branch along with all tuples to the other new created app we may call it common. Some other models in db application has ForeignKey constraints to the model Branch, so after migrating Branch to the common app I needed to alter those ForeignKey fields in considered models. I did it in 3 stepsp  ol liAddField branchtmp, which is ForeignKeycommon.Branch to somemodelli liCopy constraints from somemodel.branch to somemodel.branchtmpli liDelete somemodel.branch and rename somemodel.branchtmp to somemodel.branchli ol  pThis worked fine except one particular case, where I have model named Job and its ForeignKeyBranch field called not branch, but branchId. In this case migrate command returns an errorp  precodedjango.db.utils.ProgrammingError constraint dbjobbranchididfkey of relation dbjob does not exist codepre  pIn PostgreSQL console I investigated the dbjob table and I found that considered relation actually existsp  precodeForeignkey constraints dbjobbranchIdidfkey FOREIGN KEY branchIdid REFERENCES dbbranchname DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED codepre  pbut it is named with both uppercase and lowercase notation, while Django is obviously using lowercase notation, which causes migration to crash.p  pDoes someone have any idea how to walk around this problem, or maybe someone has a better solution for migrating a model referenced by other modelsp  pSOLVEDp  pIn Django 1.7.1 problem no longer exists.p

Negative 15167 pOkay, once again this is for a school project for which I am not allowed to use java bc idk, it is too advanced and would actually make this a lot more fun... So basically I have this rectangle inside this gigantic massive svg file. Now I want this rectangle to change size when I hover over it. I know there is a way with getbox to determine the center and make it bigger when you hover over it. since getbox is java I cant use it.  So I thought Id put two rectangles on top of each other, one slightly bigger than the other, set the biggers opacity to 0 and then put a style over it that says that the bigger ones opacity changes to 1 when I hover over it, so that it looks like the rectangle is changing size when really it just switches from one rectangle to the other. Only problem is it doesnt work. Now I dont know if it doesnt work bc you cannot put two rectangles on top of each other or if it doesnt work bc it is just plain wrong. p  precode    ltg      inkscapegroupmodelayer      idlayer12      inkscapelabelHobitton Cityicon      styledisplayinline      sodipodiinsensitivetrue      transformtranslate0,4.0044824gt     ltstyle typetextcssgt  lt[CDATA[         rect10023hover opacity 1important          ]]gt       ltstylegt      lta xlinkhref onclickwindow.openprint.html, newwindow, width300, height250 return falsegt     ltrect        stylefill8f1212fillopacity0stroke000000strokewidth0strokelinecaproundstrokelinejoinroundstrokemiterlimit4strokeopacity1strokedasharraynonestrokedashoffset0        idrect10023        width15        height15        x266.97247        y201.43393 gt      ltrect        stylefill000000fillopacity1stroke000000strokewidth0strokelinecaproundstrokelinejoinroundstrokemiterlimit4strokeopacity1strokedasharraynonestrokedashoffset0        idrect10023b        width8.2568808        height6.880734        x266.97247        y201.43393 gtltanimate attributeNamefill begin2s dur2s valuesblack660000 fillfreeze gt     ltrectgtltagt  etc codepre

I am not even sure if I can see my library yet I figure if I call one of the functions I would know. So my question is I do not understand the file in my JNI folder. I see it is written in C. Why is the include different from the usual C includes I have seen which is something like include  or I believe you can also say include foo.c also Why are there s in the package names How do I call a function in one of my libraries two levels below the JNI folder I read the JNI specification and still dont understand how JNIenv works.  p  pFor example, just to test this, I tried adding random.c to my file. It is located two levels below my JNI folder ndkbuilder says there is no such file. So I think I need to work on my Andorid.mk and make sure the build environment has visibility to random.c.

Negative 15167 pIm working on a a hrefhttpsgithub.comeyalapigeclipse relnofollowPig plugin for Eclipsea. Pig allows you to call Java methods from .pig files, and what Id like to do is to extend the default Java find references kbdCtrlShiftGkbd so that it detects such calls from Pig to Java.p  pI found a command that seems appropriate  codeorg.eclipse.jdt.ui.edit.text.java.search.references.in.workspacecode  and added a handler for it. This handler gets called whenever a user activates find references using the default key binding and my plugins editor is the active editor i.e., on a .pig file. However, when a Java file is the active editor, the original handler gets called.p  pOne thing that might be useful is a reference to another Eclipse plugin with this functionality implemented, so that calls from Java from nonJava files are detected by the default find references functionality.p

Negative 15167 pI am trying to create a circular linked list in C. But I havent understood quite well the linked lists. Well the program gets an int to a function called listendptr which initialises the circular linked list and creates nodes for the int. Then another function insertatend puts new nodes on at the end of the initialized list and returns the last node. A 3rd function prints the linked list printlist by getting the end node and printing first the first entered name and finishes with the last.p  pThe idea is to have only an end node and work only with this, but I cant make it work.

Negative 15167 pSo I have this method this uses a library to generate an external webpage to allow the user to enter their Facebook credentials for verification. Upon entering it we are creating a profile based on the that users account and saving it to a database. Once we save it to the database we are expecting a boolean to represent whether or not the account was unique. We need some way to wait for the database to complete all of its work before continuing execution.p  pIve tried several different methods including doing all the work on a new Thread which wont work since all the UI needs to be on the main thread as well as using codeAutoResetEventcode to wait for the codeauth.Completedcode event to fire. But when using this it will usually block the thread and not even present our external webpage for the user.p  pWhats making this more complicated is trying to deal with all the different events without getting ahead of ourselves. So first we need to wait for codeauth.Completedcode to fire, then from inside that event we need to wait for asynchronous coderequest.GetResponseAsync.ContinueWithltTaskltboolgtgtasync t gt ...code event to finish, and finally wait for the database to complete its task and somehow push the return value all the way back to the calling procedure.p  pAs of right now, this code will perform all the desired functions, but will return false since we arent waiting for any of the events to fire.p  precodepublic bool LoginFacebookbool isLinkedAccount      if IOS          UIKit.UIWindow window  UIKit.UIApplication.SharedApplication.KeyWindow         UIKit.UIViewController viewController  window.RootViewController endif         var auth  new OAuth2Authenticator                               clientId ,                               scope email,                               authorizeUrl new Urihttpsm.facebook.comdialogoauth,                               redirectUrl new Urihttpwww.facebook.comconnectloginsuccess.html                                 if ANDROID         Forms.Context.StartActivityauth.GetUIAndroid.App.Application.Context elif IOS         if viewController  null                      while viewController.PresentedViewController  null                 viewController  viewController.PresentedViewController             viewController.PresentViewControllerauth.GetUI, true, null          endif          If authorization succeeds or is canceled, .Completed will be fired.         auth.AllowCancel  true         auth.Completed  sender, eventArgs gt          if IOS             viewController.DismissViewControllertrue, null endif             if eventArgs.IsAuthenticated                              var request  new OAuth2RequestGET, new Urihttpsgraph.facebook.comme, null, eventArgs.Account                 request.GetResponseAsync.ContinueWithltTaskltboolgtgtasync t gt                                      if t.IsFaulted                         Console.WriteLineError   t.Exception.InnerException.Message                     else                                              try                                                      string content  t.Result.GetResponseText                             Console.WriteLinecontent                             JObject user  JsonConvert.DeserializeObjectltJObjectgtcontent                             Facebook profile  new Facebook                             profile.uuid  user[id].ToString                             profile.firstname  user[firstname].ToString                             profile.lastname  user[lastname].ToString                             profile.email  user[email].ToString                             profile.url  user[link].ToString                              Get picture                             profile.photo  httpsgraph.facebook.com  profile.uuid  picturetypelarge                              if isLinkedAccount                                                              App.AnimateLoadingLoadingImage, OverlayImage, LoadingMessage                                 return await DatabaseInstance.InsertSocialProfileSocialNetworks.Facebook, profile, true                                                          else                                                              await DatabaseInstance.LinkSocialAccountToProfileApp.UserProfile, profile, SocialNetworks.Facebook                                 return true                                                                               catch Exception e                                                      Console.WriteLinee.ToString                                                                   return false                                                return false      codepre
Negative 15167 pIve decided to try G1GC on my Eclipse Mars RC3 for JavaEE developers  installation, but I observed a very strange behaviorp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comt1L70.png altGCViewer statisticsp  pAs you can see it has run almost 700 FULL GCs for the lifecycle of the application, while only 30 minor GCs. Also I noticed that that the minor GCs are executed when the application is under load  usually when it starts and loads a lot of stuff, while it does full GCs when its idle. It was idle most of these 11 hours I would expect that when the application does nothing there would be no need for GC, or at leas it would be a minor GC. I also monitored the memory consumption of eclipse  during idle time it never incresed to more that 130140 MB, so this is one more reason why these full GCs look strange.p  pHere is my eclipse.ini jvm configp  precodeserver Xverifynone XXAggressiveOpts XXUseG1GC XXMaxGCPauseMillis100 XXUseStringDeduplication XXUseCompressedOops XXUseCompressedClassPointers XXMaxMetaspaceSize256m Xloggchomesvetlinsoftwareeclipsegc.log XXPrintGCDetails XXPrintGCTimeStamps XXPrintGCDateStamps  XXUseGCLogFileRotation XXNumberOfGCLogFiles5 XXGCLogFileSize20m Xms1g Xmx1g codepre  pHere is the GC log a hrefhttppastebin.comsVBe4w1A relnofollowhttppastebin.comsVBe4w1Aap  pJava version OpenJDK 64Bit Server VM 25.45b02 for linuxamd64 JRE 1.8.045internalb14, built on May 17 2015 192101 by buildd with gcc 4.9.2 p  pDo you have any idea why G1GC does these full GC when there is obviously not need for GC at all p

Negative 15167 pMy Access DB helps users process timecards and prepare payroll and invoices. Part of the process involves taking the hours generated by the workers and attaching a rate to the hours for billing purposes. Based on the current headcount, there can be two different bill rates that need to be applied to the hours. p  pI am using a toggle button named tglHCFlag for the user to specify which billing rate they wish to use. This is being done because the billable headcount must be specified by the user at the time of processing and cannot be calculated from the data.p  pThere is a table tblRates which contains the rates for each state of the toggle button. I also want to save the value selected by the user for the toggle button so Access can remember the last rate used by the user in this table DefaultMarkup field.

Negative 15167 pPlease bear with me in this rather long question.p  pI am currently building a voxel engine nothing like Minecraft, dont worry. I want the engine to be modular. For example, I want the voxel engine to be a seperate component to the renderer.p  pThe engine currently builds up a database of voxel objects that are each composed of a 3dimensional array. However, the renderer makes use of meshes extracted from this data using the marching cubes algorithm. I need to store both the voxel data and the mesh data for each voxel object. However, since both components are modular they cannot be stored in the same place.p  pMy current solution has been to build a secondary data structure inside the renderer that attempts to mirror the engine. It does this by duplicating the objects in the engine structure, giving each object a pointer to the object they mirror. However, this quickly becomes complex, since modifications to the original data structure have to be updated by the mirrored version.p  pAs you can see, the problem is more theoretical than technical. Could anyone help me in suggesting an OOP structure that my program may take to solve this issue better Im open to all suggestions, however radical.p  pThanks.p

Negative 15167 pI have an AngularJS project with a bare Git repository on a private server, and I will introduce automated unit testing really soon. I want to install Jenkins on the same server, so Im asking myself whether its a good idea to use a nonbare repository so Jenkins could run the tests directly from there, or if I should make Jenkins to pull the code every time. On a side note, if the nonbare repo is the best solution, is there a way to transform the repo from bare to nonbare Thanksp

Negative 15167 pI was wondering how pandas handles memory usage in python I was wondering more specifically how the memory is handled if I set a pandas dataframe query results to a variable. Behind the hood, would it just be some memory addresses to the original dataframe object or would I be cloning all of the datap  pIm afraid of memory ballooning out of control but I have a dataframe that has nonunique fields I cant index it by.  Its incredibly slow to query and plot data from it using commands like df[df[]  x amp df[]  y]. p  pTheyre both integer values in the rows. Theyre also not unique, hence the fact it returns multiple results.p  pIm very new to pandas anyway, but any insights as to how to handle a situation where Im looking for the arrays of values where two conditions match would be great too. Right now Im using an On algorithm to loop through and index it because even that runs faster than the search queries when I need to access the data quickly. Watching my system take twenty seconds on a dataset of only 6,000 rows is foreboding.p

Negative 15167 pI recently had an interview where the interviewer gave me the following scenario and asked me what data structure Id use to implement itp  pYou have 100 marbles and each marble is either red, blue, or green. The marbles are thrown into a bag and you need to have some mechanism of retrieving a randomcolored marble with replacement.p  pOkay, easy enough. After asking some questions about the constraints, I told him I would use a simple array where each bucket represents one marble. A random number function can be used to index the array, thus producing a random colored marble. p  pThat solution was fine, but then he asked what if you have many different colors, each with lt 1,000,000,000 marbles Initially I suggested to use a hash table where each key represents a color and each value represents the number of marbles in that color. The interviewer told me that was a good fix for the space constraint, but now the probability of producing one of the n colors was 1n, rather than the actual probability given by the marble totals. I needed some way to keep the probabilities the same without storing them all in memory. I ended up not thinking of anything, and the solution he gave me was thisp  pFind the total of each color this would be On, which is fine for a setup and set up an array where each bucket represents the cumulative total of each of the colors. For example, if your marble totals were R 3, B 5, G 1,000,000,000, then the array would look like [3] [8] [1,000,000,008]. Then he said you can now use a binary search with a random index to obtain a marble of a random color while still maintaining the correct probabilities.

Negative 15167 pSo Ive searched for hours trying to find an answer to this specific problem Im having with no luck. Would be great if someone can help me out. p  pSo essentially I have a MainActivity.java, FragmentA.java, activitymain.xml, and fragment.xml. So what fragment.xml has is just a container that have 3 buttons in a box that when pressed Start showing a number starting from 3 as the buttons text. So when you click the button again, it changes the button text to 2 and then 1 and then 0 and then back to 3. All the logic that decrements the numbers and changes the button text to that number is in the FragmentA.java class. All thats logic is working, Ive tested it. Finally I create and add FragmentA dynamically to MainActivitys activitymain.xml LinearLayout when an add button in actionbar is clicked. p  pSo now when you press the add button in the actionbar in MainActivity, the fragment.xml view is correctly appended to activitymain.xmls LinearLayout. The problem is, only the first fragment thats appended in the LinearLayout is working numbers decrement when button is clicked. The other fragment copies are not working or doing anything, but just showing. So the buttons decrement logic is only working for the first added view. Why is that I thought the point of fragments was to elimanate duplication. Im guessing this is some ID issue with the same fragment being created multiple times Any idea on how to fix thisp  pstrongFragmentA.javastrongp  precodeButton b1, b2, b3 int[] mCounter  3, 3, 3   Override public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState      View v  inflater.inflateR.layout.fragment, null     return v   Override public void onActivityCreatedBundle savedInstanceState      super.onActivityCreatedsavedInstanceState     b1  Button getActivity.findViewByIdR.id.button     b1.setOnClickListenerthis     b2  Button getActivity.findViewByIdR.id.button2     b2.setOnClickListenerthis     b3  Button getActivity.findViewByIdR.id.button3     b3.setOnClickListenerthis   Override public void onClickView v      switchv.getId          case R.id.button             b1.setTextInteger.toStringmCounter[0]             decrementCounterByButtonPosition0             break         case R.id.button2             b2.setTextInteger.toStringmCounter[1]             decrementCounterByButtonPosition1             break         case R.id.button3             b3.setTextInteger.toStringmCounter[2]             decrementCounterByButtonPosition2             break        public void decrementCounterByButtonPositionint counterId      if mCounter[counterId]  0          mCounter[counterId]      else          mCounter[counterId]  3       codepre  pstrongMainActivity.javastrongp  precodeOverride protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain   Override public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu              getMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.menumain, menu     return true   Override public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item      int id  item.getItemId      if id  R.id.actionaddexercise          FragmentManager fragmentManager  getFragmentManager         FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction  fragmentManager.beginTransaction         FragmentA ContainerFragment  new FragmentA             fragmentTransaction.addR.id.container, ContainerFragment, HELLO         fragmentTransaction.commit         return true           return super.onOptionsItemSelecteditem  codepre  pstrongactivitymain.xmlstrongp  precodeltScrollView xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidbackground1FDA9Agt  ltLinearLayout     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidpaddingLeftdimenactivityhorizontalmargin     androidpaddingRightdimenactivityhorizontalmargin     androidpaddingTopdimenactivityverticalmargin     androidpaddingBottomdimenactivityverticalmargin toolscontext.MainActivity     androidorientationvertical     androidididcontainergt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pp  pstrongfragment.xmlstrongp  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightwrapcontent androidpaddingTop0dp androidpaddingBottomdimenactivityverticalmargin toolscontext.MainActivity gt  ltLinearLayout     androidididglobalContainer     androidorientationvertical     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidlayoutmarginBottom10dpgt      ltLinearLayout         androidorientationhorizontal         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheight80dp         androidbackgroundfff         androidlayoutalignParentToptrue         androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue         androidlayoutalignParentStarttrue         androidbackgroundTint333         androidgravitycenterverticalcenterhorizontalgt          ltButton             styleandroidattrbuttonStyleSmall             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidididbutton             androidmaxWidth10dp             androidmaxHeight10dp             androidlayoutmarginLeft5dp             androidlayoutmarginRight5dp gt          ltButton             styleandroidattrbuttonStyleSmall             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidididbutton2             androidmaxWidth10dp             androidmaxHeight10dp             androidlayoutmarginLeft5dp             androidlayoutmarginRight5dp gt          ltButton             styleandroidattrbuttonStyleSmall             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidididbutton3             androidmaxWidth10dp             androidmaxHeight10dp             androidlayoutmarginLeft5dp             androidlayoutmarginRight5dp gt     ltLinearLayoutgt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pp  pstrongAny help appreciated.

Negative 15167 pIn AngularFormly, is it possible for nested formlyforms to bind to the same formState and if so how  p  pIve taken from the repeating section example a hrefhttpangularformly.comexampleadvancedrepeatingsection relnofollowhttpangularformly.comexampleadvancedrepeatingsectiona.p  pFrom the documentation, formState is intended to allow fields to share data.  In my application, multiple formlyforms are used to compose a complex form.p  pMy intent in the example below is to bind the Form Complete checkbox to the formState in order to trigger validation updates thanks to enabling options.extras.validateOnModelChange on the extended input type.  The problem is I cant seem to get the nested formlyforms to share the same formState for this to happen in those contexts.p  pIf the Form Complete checkbox is toggled validation should update.  Youll see the field outside of the repeating section updates its validation, while the one in the repeating section does not until typed in, but thats because the validator is searching up the scope to find the formComplete state.p  pa hrefhttpsjsbin.comwitebubacoedithtml,js,output relnofollowhttpsjsbin.comwitebubacoedithtml,js,outputap  pHow might I accomplish this or is there a better approachp

I created the jsfiddle a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.net8ua3thef relnofollowherea to boil down the issue.p  pIf you click the two buttons at the bottom in succession Delete outer A, and then Delete inner 5, everything works normally. emHoweverem, if you perform the same action by clicking the Delete button next to the outer A text box, followed by the Delete button next to the inner 5 text box, the code breaks. Inspecting the second Delete button after the first one is clicked reveals that the onclick event handler that was originally attached to the second Delete button is no longer bound.

Negative 15167 pI have a class that is set to be instantiated only onceemI am not sure if I am explaining this correctlyem. p  pHere is my code for the instantiation method of that classp  precode Manager getManager      static Manager sharedManager     static dispatchoncet onceToken      dispatchonceamponceToken,              sharedManager  [[Manager alloc] init]           return sharedManager  codepre  pSo, this simply means that I only have one instance of the delegate also. Correct me if I am wrong. p  pOne of the methods of my delegate is code void onInfoReceivedInfo infocode. This method is called every time when data is received from the socket.   p  pThis is a sample on how I call the method of the delegatep  precodedispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,          ifdelegate  nil ampamp [delegate respondsToSelectorselectoronInfoReceived]              [delegate onInfoReceivedinfo]       codepre  pNow, the problem is like this.p  pIn my initial controller, if I set the delegate like thisp  precode  voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      Manager manager  [Manager getManager]     [manager setDelegateself]  codepre  pThe method codeonInfoReceivedcode will always be called when data is received from the socket.p  pBut if I do it this wayp  precode voidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated      [super viewDidAppearanimated]      Manager manager  [Manager getManager]     [manager setDelegateself]  codepre  pThe method codeonInfoReceivedcode will never be called.p  pI dont understand why this is happening. Because I am expecting that if data received the time that delegate is not initialized, then the method will not be called, its clear from the if logic I wrote, no doubt about it. But, if I where able to instantiate the delegate after awhileembecause viewDidAppear will be called with a small delay after viewDidLoad is called.em, why isnt it called then Its not like the socket is only receiving data once, it is strongCONTINUOUSstrong. p  pstrongWhy I have to put it under codeviewDidAppearcode.strong p  pSince I only have one instance of that object every time it is called, I guess my delegate has only one instance also. When I set delegate for initial controller, it is fine. But when I go to the second controlleremwith navigation controllerem. I need to reset the delegate for the second controller. So after setting the delegate for the second controller, I guess the delegate of the first controller will be overriden. So, when I go back to the first controller, I need to reset the delegate for the first controller. But in this case, the codeviewDidLoadcode method wont be called anymore, because I just popped to the root controller. Thats why I thought of setting the delegate on codeviewDidAppearcode of the first controller. p  pPlease explain this to me. Thanks in advance   p

This study assessed the readability of trial descriptions at ClinicalTrials.gov using multiple quantitative measures.ltAbstractTextgt                 ltAbstractText LabelMATERIALS AND METHODS NlmCategoryMETHODSgtThe analysis included all 165988 trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as of April 30, 2014. To obtain benchmarks, the authors also analyzed 2 other medical corpora 1 all 955 Health Topics articles from MedlinePlus and 2 a random sample of 100000 clinician notes retrieved from an electronic health records system intended for conveying internal communication among medical professionals. The authors characterized each of the corpora using 4 surface metrics, and then applied 5 different scoring algorithms to assess their readability. The authors hypothesized that clinician notes would be most difficult to read, followed by trial descriptions and MedlinePlus Health Topics articles.ltAbstractTextgt                 ltAbstractText LabelRESULTS NlmCategoryRESULTSgtTrial descriptions have the longest average sentence length 26.1 words across all corpora 65 of their words used are not covered by a basic medical English dictionary. In comparison, average sentence length of MedlinePlus Health Topics articles is 61 shorter, vocabulary size is 95 smaller, and dictionary coverage is 46 higher. All 5 scoring algorithms consistently rated CliniclTrials.gov trial descriptions the most difficult corpus to read, even harder than clinician notes. On average, it requires 18 years of education to properly understand these trial descriptions according to the results generated by the readability assessment algorithms.ltAbstractTextgt                 ltAbstractText LabelDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION NlmCategoryCONCLUSIONSgtTrial descriptions at CliniclTrials.gov are extremely difficult to read.

Im trying it the way outlined a hrefhttpwww.apeth.comiOSBookch20.html relnofollowherea on apeth.com as was referenced on another SO question. My implementation does not set a contentSize or use a contentView as the scrollView should adjust to the size of its subviews. p  pThe problem is that the UIButtons and UILabels seem to not have the constraints applied. I had to bunch up my UIButtons and UILabels to fit on the Storyboard so I could see them like so. However, they appear just like this when I run the app. The constraints should work at runtime, but it just seems like they are using the Storyboard rough layout. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comuLnWs.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuLnWs.png altUIViews bunched up at end of scrollview in Storyboardap  pAnd this is how it looks on the 5Sp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comp1rhV.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comp1rhV.png altUIViews bunched up at end of scrollview on deviceap  pThe UIScrollview constraints to superview are        0 0 UIScrollView 0        0p  pThe subviews of UIScrollview are as followsp  blockquote   pSubviews  Center verticalp      p16firstButton4firstLabel16secondButton4secondLabeletc...16lastButton4lastLabel16p blockquote  pEDIT Followed the suggestion in comment and added the label to the button itself to make it simpler and set contentView to 728.
