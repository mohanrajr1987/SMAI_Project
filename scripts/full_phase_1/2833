Positive 2833 pHi Im trying to implement a reset function to this drag and drop interface. Initially the bars are arranged in a random order hardcoded positions and the user cant move them around by dragdrop. I want a reset function to refresh the div element with the table to its initial positions.p  pI have tried to copy the innerhtml code and set it again on the reset button click but this method doesnt seem to work. Is there any other way in which this is possiblep  precodeltscriptgt var container  document.getElementByIdgame1   var content  container.innerHTML  function allowDropev      ev.preventDefault   function dragev      ev.dataTransfer.setDatatext, ev.target.id   function dropev      ev.preventDefault     var data  ev.dataTransfer.getDatatext     var evtargetev.target       if evtarget[object HTMLImageElement]            evtarget  evtarget.parentNode              else        ev.target.appendChilddocument.getElementByIddata          function reset1     var container  document.getElementByIdgame1     var content  container.innerHTML     alertcontent     container.innerHTML content  codepre  pp  precodeltdiv idgame1 stylepaddingtop 140px paddingleft40pxgt ltdiv classcontainer1gt     ltdivgt     lttablegt     lttrgtlttdgt         ltdiv iddiv1 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltimg iddrag8 srcimg8.png draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent ondropgtltdivgt         lttdgt         lttdgt         ltdiv iddiv2 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltimg iddrag4 srcimg4.png draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent gtltdivgt         lttdgt         lttdgt         ltdiv iddiv3 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltimg iddrag3 srcimg3.png draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent gtltdivgt         lttdgt         lttdgt         ltdiv iddiv4 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltimg iddrag5 srcimg5.png draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent gtltdivgt         lttdgt         lttdgt         ltdiv iddiv5 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltimg iddrag1 srcimg1.png draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent gtltdivgt         lttdgt         lttdgt         ltdiv iddiv6 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltimg iddrag7 srcimg7.png draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent gtltdivgt         lttdgt         lttdgt         ltdiv iddiv7 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltimg iddrag6 srcimg6.png draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent gtltdivgt         lttdgt         lttdgt         ltdiv iddiv8 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltimg iddrag9 srcimg9.png draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent gtltdivgt         lttdgt         lttdgt         ltdiv iddiv9 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltimg iddrag2 srcimg2.png draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent gtltdivgt         lttdgt         lttdgt         ltdiv iddiv10 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltimg iddrag10 srcimg10.png draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent gtltdivgt         lttdgt         lttdgt         ltdiv iddiv11 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltdivgt         lttdgt         lttrgt      lttablegt     lttablegt         lttrgt         lttd stylepaddingleft230px paddingtop15px width100pxgt            ltinput typebutton valueReset idreset onclickreset1 stylewidth150px backgroundcolorblack colorwhitegt          lttdgtlttrgt     lttablegt         ltbrgt             ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pp
Positive 2833 pEither this is not easycant be doneor I cant find the answer... I can drag drop an image INTO a frame and view it, but in this case I want to do the opposite  I want to drag whats in the frame and drop it onto the desktop as a specific type of document in this case, a PDF. p  pExamplep  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comMmHCeuz.jpg altdocument in windowp  pThis is an image of a pdf which I already know how to save manually as a pdf. It would be easier for my users to just drag that document onto the desktop as a pdf. Is this even possible and if so, can someone point me in the right directionp

Positive 2833 pI am currently evaluating building an app that uses the Windows Store architecture formerly known as Metro. This app will target not just Windows Phone devices, but also Windows 10 desktop.p  pOne function of the app would be to draganddrop files onto the app from File Explorer. An example scenario would be to clickandhold on a JPEG image and drag it into the app, which would then process the file. This would provide the user with another option instead of going through file dialogs.p  pI can find plenty of resources about using draganddrop eminsideem Windows Store apps, but it seems theres no information about draganddrop from a normal Windows desktop app, such as File Explorer.p  pWith Windows 10, Store apps are promoted to proper windows, rather than fullscreen apps, so this functionality seems to be a bit more useful in this environment.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19725752draganddropfilesintowindowsstoreappcomment2930945419725752This commenta seems to suggest that it isnt supported, but is dated two years ago and refers to Windows 8.

I need a little direction on how to tackle this. Is it even possible, do I have several options Are there better solutions than a drag and drop scriptprogram Mind you I do not need any workedout code but just the information on how I could do this using free tools.

I can hardcode it to disable a specific class i.e. .dropTargetm11a.droppabledisable  Unfortunately I need iteration e.g. going through each .dropTargetxxxxx class or each dropContainerxxx id.p  pThank you very much in advancep  pThats what I have so farp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt ltheadgt  ltmeta charsetUTF8gt   ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.11.3jquery.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscript srcjsjqueryui.jsgtltscriptgt    ltstylegt  ul    liststyletype none   li.draggable      liststylenone   buttonlist1a li  display inlineblock liststyletype none   width 60px height 10px  margintop 70px       m1l3      position absolute     top 25px     left 80px     height 15px      width 110px      displayflex        alignitemscenter     zindex 10    opacity 0.3    mozopacity 0.3    filter alphaopacity30    backgroundcolorblue        m1l2    position absolute   top 40px   left 80px   height 15px    width 110px    displayflex        alignitemscenter   zindex 10   opacity 0.3  mozopacity 0.3  filter alphaopacity30  backgroundcolorred       m1l1    position absolute   top 55px   left 80px   height 15px    width 110px    displayflex        alignitemscenter   zindex 10   opacity 0.3  mozopacity 0.3  filter alphaopacity30 backgroundcoloryellow         m2l3    position absolute   top 25px   left 210px   height 15px    width 110px    displayflex        alignitemscenter   zindex 10   opacity 0.3   mozopacity 0.3   filter alphaopacity30   backgroundcolorblue         m2l2    position absolute   top 40px   left 210px   height 15px    width 110px    displayflex        alignitemscenter   zindex 10   opacity 0.3   mozopacity 0.3   filter alphaopacity30    backgroundcolorred        m2l1    position absolute   top 55px   left 210px   height 15px    width 110px    displayflex        alignitemscenter   zindex 10  opacity 0.3  mozopacity 0.3  filter alphaopacity30   backgroundcoloryellow       m3l3    position absolute   top 25px   left 350px   height 15px    width 110px    displayflex        alignitemscenter   zindex 10  opacity 0.3  mozopacity 0.3  filter alphaopacity30   backgroundcolorblue       m3l2    position absolute   top 40px   left 350px   height 15px    width 110px    displayflex        alignitemscenter   zindex 10  opacity 0.3  mozopacity 0.3  filter alphaopacity30   backgroundcolorred       m3l1    position absolute   top 55px   left 350px   height 15px    width 110px    displayflex        alignitemscenter   zindex 10   opacity 0.3   mozopacity 0.3   filter alphaopacity30   backgroundcoloryellow   ltstylegt    ltheadgt  ltbodygt     ltdiv iddropContainerm1gt  ltdiv idm1l3 class dropTargetm11a droppable1agtltdivgt     ltdiv idm1l2 class dropTargetm11a droppable1agtltdivgt   ltdiv idm1l1 class dropTargetm11a droppable1agtltdivgt       ltdiv iddropContainerm2gt     ltdiv idm2l3 class dropTargetm21a droppable1agtltdivgt       ltdiv idm2l2 class dropTargetm21a droppable1agtltdivgt  ltdiv idm2l1 class dropTargetm21a droppable1agtltdivgt       ltdiv iddropContainerm3gt   ltdiv idm3l3 class dropTargetm31a droppable1agtltdivgt       ltdiv idm3l2 class dropTargetm31a droppable1agt ltdivgt  ltdiv idm3l1 class dropTargetm31a droppable1agtltdivgt        ltdivgt           ltul id  buttonlist1agt lt answers 1 a    gt    ltli class  buttonsmall draggable1a id  image1 draggabletruegtImage1ltligtlt  gtltli class  buttonsmall draggable1a id  image2 draggabletruegtImage2ltligtlt      gtltli class  buttonsmall draggable1a id  image3 draggabletruegtImage3ltligt   ltulgt  ltscriptgt  document.readyfunction a1dnd   .draggable1a.draggable    cursorAt    top 5,    left 30 ,   cursor  pointer,      revert  invalid,   opacity 0.35,         helper function event      var id  this.attrid     var ret  this.clone     ret.attrdragId, id     console.logdragId , ret.attrdragId     return ret   ,    start  function event, ui          ,  end start   drag  function event, ui             ,  end drag   stop  functionevent, ui      ui.helper.clone.appendTo this.parent       ui.helper.clone.disabled             .droppable1a.droppable   accept .draggable1a,    tolerance pointer,    drop function event,ui       var draggableid  ui.draggable.attrid     var droppableid  this.attrid      var correctAnswer           m1l1  image1,         m1l3  image1,         m2l2  image2,         m3l1  image3       ifcorrectAnswer[droppableid]  draggableid         console.logui       ui.draggable.attrid, ui.helper.attrid             console.logdroppableid    localStorage.totalCorrectAnswers  parseFloatlocalStorage.totalCorrectAnswers  1.0           else        console.logui.helper.attr dragId      console.logWrong     console.logdroppableid                          ltscriptgt  ltbodygt   lthtmlgt codepre

Or is it possible to send primefaces components as a list from bean to xhtml.p  h2xhtmlh2  precode ltplayout fullPagefalsegt                             ltplayoutUnit positioneast size200 headerRight gt                             ltplayoutUnit positionwest size300 headerLeft                                 closabletrue collapsibletruegt                                 lthformgt                                     ltpfieldset legendAvailableCarsgt                                         ltpdataGrid idavailableCars varcar valuesdsd                                             columns3gt                                             ltpcolumngt                                                 ltppanel idpnl headerDrop Down styletextaligncentergt                                                     ltptab titleLayoutgt                                                         ltbr gt                                                         lthoutputLabel forname valueStandard Label gt                                                         ltpinputText idname disabledtrue gt                                                         ltpdraggable forname gt                                                         ltbr gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleRadio Buttongt                                                         ltpoutputLabel forconsole valueTypes gt                                                         ltpselectOneRadio idconsolegt                                                             ltfselectItem itemLabelXbox One itemValueXbox One gt                                                             ltfselectItem itemLabelPS4 itemValuePS4 gt                                                         ltpselectOneRadiogt                                                         ltpdraggable forconsole gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleDrop Downgt                                                         ltpoutputLabel forcountry valueItems  gt                                                         ltpselectOneMenu idcountry stylewidth150px                                                             valuelist gt                                                         ltpdraggable forcountry gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleImagegt                                                         ltpgraphicImage idpic valueimagesprometheus.jpg gt                                                         ltpdraggable forpic gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleSavegt                                                         ltpcommandButton idlayoutSave valueSave gt                                                         ltpdraggable forlayoutSave gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleCancelgt                                                         ltpcommandButton idlayoutCancel valueCancel gt                                                         ltpdraggable forlayoutCancel gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                 ltppanelgt                                                  ltpdraggable forpnl reverttrue                                                     handle.uipaneltitlebar stack.uipanel gt                                              ltpcolumngt                                         ltpdataGridgt                                     ltpfieldsetgt                                 lthformgt                              ltplayoutUnitgt                              ltplayoutUnit positioncenter gt                                 lthformgt                                     ltpfieldset idselectedCars stylewidth 800px height 800pxgt                                         ltpoutputPanel iddropAreagt                                             lthoutputText valueDrop here stylefontsize24px gt                                          ltpoutputPanelgt                                     ltpfieldsetgt                                     ltpdroppable forselectedCars tolerancetouch                                         activeStyleClassuistatehighlightgt                                         ltpajax listenerfundamentCreatorBean.dropped gt                                     ltpdroppablegt                                 lthformgt                             ltplayoutUnitgt                         ltplayoutgt codepre

Negative 2833 pI have been banging my head on this one all day.  The C project I am currently working on has a requirement to display an editable value.  The currently selected digit displays the incremented value above and decremented value below for said digit.  It is useful to be able to reference the editable value as both a number and collection of digits.  What would be awesome is if there was some indexable form of a floating point number, but I have been unable to find such a solution.  I am throwing this question out there to see if there is something obvious I am missing or if I should just roll my own.p  phr p  pThanks for the advice  I was hoping for a solution that wouldnt convert from float  string  int, but I emthinkem that is the best way to get away from floating point quantization issues.  I ended up going with boostformat and just referencing the individual characters of the string.  I cant see that being a huge performance difference compared to using combinations of modf and fmod to attempt to get a digit out of a float It probably does just that behind the scenes, only more robustly than my implementation.  p

Negative 2833 pIm building a lineofbusiness application in Silverlight and need to get the user to edit two .NET TimeSpan values.

Ive observed people using the application and while some have no problem quickly entering times, other people struggle.p  pGiven that Im working in Silverlight2, what would you see as the perfect custom control that easily let you visualize and edit these two TimeSpansp  pTo make things harder, the UI should allow any time of the day to be selected with accuracy down to the minute, but emphasize times within the normal working day eg 800am  500pm. Some users tend to enter 200 am when they really mean 200pm.p  pIn my app, Im tending towards aligning the times and durations to 5 minute intervals. As a bit of background, this app is similar to a room booking app where people specify when and how long they want a room for.p

Negative 2833 pI have a WPF Window, and I want to determine when a user finishes moving a Window around on the desktop. I hooked up to the LocationChanged event and thats fine, but I cant figure out how to determine when the user stops moving the window by releasing the left mouse button.p  pTheres no event to help me determine that, something like a LocationChangedEnded event. I tried hooking up to MouseLeftButtonUp but that event is never fired. p  pAnyone has any ideas p
Negative 2833 pMost of the ASP.NET MVC paging solutions I have found by googling look like they get all rows from a database table in the form of a IEnumerable collection, perform some paging conversion on the IEnumerable collection, and then return the results to the view.

Negative 2833 pbUpdatedb  This is kind of an interesting problem I am experiencing.  I need to have a progress dialog show when a background process is running.

However, I have set up a login class to pass the parameters to and I still receive errors stating that I cannot access the UI thread.  The main problem is that lr and binding are accessed by another window so they must be public static data from the other window I set public static Service binding  MainWindow.binding.

Negative 2833 pIve been working on a practice Android application to familiarize myself with the platform.  Specifically, the app Im trying to implement allows the user to select a sound file MP3 or WAV to play at a specific date and time showing a dialog with a progress bar and an OKCancel button allowing the user to stop the playing of the sound file.  I want it to behave something like the countdown apps Ive seen or even the builtin alarm clock app.  As Im implementing this simple I thought app, Im trying to better understand the platform and make the application conform to the Android way.p  pAs Ive been writing the app, I learn more about how things are supposed to work on the Android platform. And heres where Im getting a bit confused. During my attempts to get the alarm to fire and display, Im learning that properly formed Android applications are not supposed to show dialogs as a result of a background service or broadcast receiver being invoked through Androids alarm service. Instead, I think, the app is supposed to use a notification on the status bar to alert the user. The user then has the option to look at the notification to see what the app is trying to tell them.p  pIve managed to get the dialog I wanted to bring up to appear by launching a new activity from a service that was launched by Androids alarm service.  However, it appears that Ive broken an Android rule by doing so. I knew this first because I saw a message in the DDMS LogCat window that asked if I was sure I wanted to start a new activity from a Service. Second, I read in several places that it was not nice to do so.   One statement that comes to mind was from a Google developer that said hed certainly uninstall an app that did something like that.p  pThe app is instead, if I understand correctly, supposed to use the status bar and notification to get the users attention and allow them to see what the app wants at their leisure. This seems counterintuitive to what my app is trying to do.  Again, Im trying to get it to behave, essentially, like the countdown apps Ive seen or the builtin alarm clock application that comes on the Android phones.  If my app is not behaving correctly, is the alarm clock app behaving  Obviously Id say the alarm clock app is doing exactly what Id expect.  And a user of my app, I think, would expect the sound file to play with a dialog showing allowing the playing of the sound file to be stopped without having to go through the status bar.p  pAm I understanding the Android platform correctly  Any opinions on how an app like this could be implemented without being naughty by bringing up the dialog I mentioned Id like the application to be regarded as a wellformed Android app, but Im having a difficult time seeing how my app is so different from others Ive seen or even the builtin alarm clock application.p  pThanks Jeffp

Negative 2833 pI want to display a modal view, and want it to cover the iPhones status bar.p  pI tried setting the modal view controllers wantsFullScreenLayout property to YES I also set its parents property to YES as well.

Negative 2833 pA product Im helping to develop will basically work like thisp  ul liA Web publisher creates a new page on their site that includes a codeltscriptgtcode from our server.li liWhen a visitor reaches that new page, that codeltscriptgtcode gathers the text content of the page and sends it to our server via a POST request crossdomain, using a codeltformgtcode inside of an codeltiframegtcode.li liOur server processes the text content and returns a response via a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiJSONPJSONPJSONPa that includes an HTML fragment listing links to related content around the Web. This response is cached and served to subsequent visitors until we receive another POST request with text content from the same URL, at which point we regenerate a fresh response. These POSTs only happen when our cached TTL expires, at which point the server signifies that and prompts the codeltscriptgtcode on the page to gather and POST the text content again.li ul  pThe problem is that this system seems inherently insecure. In theory, anyone could spoof the HTTP POST request including the referer header, so we couldnt just check for that that sends a pages content to our server. This could include any text content, which we would then use to generate the related content links for that page.p  pThe primary difficulty in making this secure is that our JavaScript is publicly visible. We cant use any kind of private key or other cryptic identifier or pattern because that wont be secret.p  pIdeally, we need a method that somehow verifies that a POST request corresponding to a particular Web page is authentic. We cant just scrape the Web page and compare the content with whats been POSTed, since the purpose of having JavaScript submit the content is that it may be behind a login system.p  pAny ideas I hope Ive explained the problem well enough. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.p

The buffer never gets written to, so the physical memory is never used. When the address space runs out, the system crashes. In the latter case, the system runs out of physical memory before it runs out of address space, the GC is triggered and the objects are collected.p  pHowever, heres the part I dont get. Assuming my theory is correct, why doesnt the GC trigger when the address space runs low If my theory is incorrect, then whats the real explanationp

Negative 2833 pI am writing a PHP application targeted at nongeeks, nonprogrammers. I need to create an option page with a bunch of options and then store those options...somewhere. Using a database application MySQLPostgreSQLSQLite is out of the question because it will require more configuration than the user needs to do I dont want the user to do any kind of configuration if he doesnt want to. So the only solution left is to write the configuration to a configuration file. On the other hand, I also want that configuration file to be humanreadable in case the user is a geek and he wants to edit the config file directly or if he wants to edit the file remotely via SSH or any kind of reason...p  pHere are the couple of potential solutions I foundp  pstrongUsing a JSON file...strongp  p...Retrieve the data from the file, using jsondecode to convert the data, output it into HTML, retrieve any changes, encode back using jsonencode, etc. You get the picture. There are a couple things that I dont like about this method, the main one being that the encoded JSON data using PHP will no be well formatted and very hard to edit without being reformatted beforehand.p  pstrongUsing an XML filestrongp  pI wont describe that solution because I dont really like it either...and I dont know how to use XSLT and dont really want to learn...and because its a pretty heavyweight solution, at least compared to the JSON solution. Correct me if Im wrong.p  pstrongUsing an INI filestrongp  pI love INI files, really I love them I think theyre really the most readable, and its hard to mess up ie syntax errors. The problem with that solution is that there is no native way to writeedit an ini file. I found a topic showing a custom method to write one...that might be the solution I will adopt if I dont find anything better...p  pstrongUsing two filesstrongp  pThat last solution seems as reasonable as the INI solution. In fact, I could use an INI file as input the file that the user would edit if he wants to and an XMLJSON file as output the file that will be edited by PHP every time the user changes options using the web frontend. At this point, the best solution would be to ask the user to reload the configuration manually if he edited the config file directly, so that the output file is always up to date.p  hr  pI know none of the solutions above are perfect, and thats why I created this topic to ask for advice. What is the best solution Maybe probably I missed yet another solution.p  pOne last thing YAML isnt a valid solution because its a lot easier to mess up the syntax if youre not used to it. PHP is not a solution either because editing PHP with PHP is a pain. PHP is only a good solution if I want to retrieve some configuration but not edit it directly via a web frontend.p

Negative 2833 pWith the dump debugging support in .NET 4.0 we are looking into automatically after asking the user of course  creating minidumps of C program crashes to upload them to our issue tracking system so that the minidumps can assist in resolving the cause of the crash.p  pEverything is working fine when using the WithFullMemory minidump type.

I have 3 scenarios that I can think ofp  ol liUsing select to check FDSETSIZE sockets at a time, then iterating over all of them to receive the data. Wouldnt this require two calls to recv for each socket returned MSGPEEK to allocate a buffer then recv it again which would be the same as 3li liUsing select to check one socket at a time. Wouldnt this also be like 3 It requires the two calls to recv.li liUse recv with MSGPEEK one socket at a time, allocate a buffer then call recv again. Wouldnt this be better because we can skip all the calls to select Or is the overhead of one recv call too muchli ol  pIve already coded the situations to 1 and 2, but Im not sure which one to use.

Negative 2833 pI currently have a simple database program that reads keys in from a text file and stores them in a doubly linked list values are read later if they are required. Currently, I do a sequential search on the list, but that is clearly rather slow. I was hoping that there is another way to do. I was reading about binary trees in particular, red black trees but I dont know to much about them, and was hoping that I could gleam something from the stackoverflow hivemind  I suppose my question is, what is the fastest way to do a search in a doubly linked listp  pEDIT Forgot to say that the list is sorted. Dont know if that changes anything. Also, the reason I only read in keys is that the max value length is 102432 bytes, which I feel is too large. Note that this is for an assignment, so typical usage scenarios dont apply. The professors are likely going to be stress testing the hell out of this thing, and I dont want to be mallocing blocks that big.p

Negative 2833 pI have a form in MS Access 2010 with two sub forms in it. Ive defined onetoone relationship with the tables behind the forms. Both the subforms should be used to create a record in corresponding tables and then update the foreign key in the parent form. But when I fill the subform first, an entry is created in the corresponding table but the foreign key doesnt get updated. Shouldnt this happen automatically Or should I add code for updating parent forms fieldp  pAlso when I start filling the main form first and then jump to any of the subform, I get the following error messagebr You must enter a value in the Activations.dbBoxID field Activations is the main form here and dbBoxID is the foreign key field.p  pAnother issue is that I dont want subforms to update the corresponding tables until an entry in main table is also created i.e. all required fields in main form are also filled.p  pI am new to MS Access. Any help would be really appreciatedp

Negative 2833 pOk, so for a program I need to know two facts, the length of input and which highest number this length is closest to that is divisible by 4. For example. If the length is 1, I want to record 4. If the length is 3, I want to record 4. If the length is 5, I want to record 8.p  pMathematically I can divide the length by 4, this gives a decimal. If I round it up and times by 4 it gives me the answer I need. So, how do I get C to round up the contents of an int I may be overcomplicating this so please say if I have missed something simple to do this.p  pEdit I should add, I already know the length, this is something I would enter myself.p

Negative 2833 pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pemIve accepted my answer since I believe that the OnePerRequest module shouldnt clear out the cache until all other modules have had a chance to run. However, after we port the rest of our pages to MVC I will be reworking our Unit of Work implementation to be more in line with Remos suggestion.emp  pI just upgraded from Ninject 2.0 to Ninject 2.1 and Im now having issues with my NHibernate UnitOfWork implementation.p  pMy implementation is as follows. I have an HttpModule that subscribes to BeginRequest and EndRequest and has the following code.p  precodepublic void BeginRequestobject sender, EventArgs e   var app  WebApplicationsender  var repository  app.Kernel.GetltIRepositorygt   repository.BeginRequest   public void EndRequestobject sender, EventArgs e   var app  WebApplicationsender  var repository  app.Kernel.GetltIRepositorygt   repository.EndRequest  codepre  pThe IRepository implementation takes an NHibernate ISession as a dependency. Here are the two bindings.p  precodeBindltISessiongt.ToMethodcontext gt NHibernateSessionFactory.Instance.OpenSession.InRequestScope BindltIRepositorygt.ToltNHibernateRepositorygt.InTransientScope codepre  pNHibernate repository opens up a transaction in BeginRequest and commits it in EndRequest. With the upgrade to Ninject 2.1. The OnePerRequestModule is now interfering with this code. Since it is attached to the EndRequest event first it fires before my DataModule and clears the ISession from the Kernel cache. This means that the IRepository gets a brand new ISession and thus cant commit the transaction. Complicating matters is the fact that OnePerRequestModule registers with the Kernel not once, but twice. Once in the KernelBase constructor and once again in the ApplicationStart method in the NinjectHttpApplication.p  pSo its pretty convoluted and one of the ways Ive found to turn this functionality off is to call codeOnePerRequestModule.StopManagingKernelcode twice in the OnApplicationStarted method in my Global.asax.cs. Does anyone have any suggestions in regards to how to handle this Im assuming theres a reason OnePerRequestModule was introduced, but it would be nice to keep with my UnitOfWork implementation.p

Negative 2833 pperhaps a stupid question, yet...

Negative 2833 pI have an application whose orientation is hard coded to landscape in the Manifest file. When the user presses optionsmenu on the application, the application launches a gridviewlistview depending on the option clicked. This works very well in the landscape mode. However, I run into problems if I want to change the UI when the user views the application in portrait mode. No matter what the mode the phone is in, the UIs are always displayed in landscape. Because of the setting in the Manifest file. I tried doing a rotate animation 90 degrees, but that causes problems. For the list view, the scrolling does not work properly after the animation, and for the grid view, the clicks on the grid view elements correspond to the older layout landscape and not the newer one after rotate animation. Has anyone encountered this problem before Any suggestions would be most welcome. p

Negative 2833 pI was trying to integrate jQuery to use it for some effects in my site and I started to search for the solution of integrating in the best way. It simply came to my mind to write a helper which would get the selector of proper element and output the javascript code. Then I ran into the new JsHelper in cake 1.3 but Im really having problems understanding the concept of JsHelper. I mean for sure each JavaScript block that Im gonna write is more than one call to jQuery methods and many of them are also not transfered to JsHelper. So for what reason may I use the JsHelper it would be much easier to write the javascript specified for my action inside a helper and use it simply as any other helper. The only thing which comes to my mind as a good capability is to use the caching and buffering options provided in JsHelper nothing more. Did I understood the JsHelper well or I have missed some pointsp

Negative 2833 pIt may just be that I havent hit on the right pattern yet.  I have a ListView displaying a list of records which is initially populated from a database.  Now, I want the user to be able to optionally or remove records and then at some point commit the new set of records.  Until committed, nothing should happen in the database.p  pSo, if there are 5 database records to display and the user chooses to add two records, two records will be appended to the control.  They could then choose to remove a real record, a fake record, and a new fake record, and then commit.p  pAt this point, I will reconcile the control with the database.p  pEverything here is fine, EXCEPT the part where I add a new record to the list view without reconsulting the database and then adding a record to the DataSource and rebinding.p  pThe control already represents the proposed state, minus the requested new record.p  pHow is this traditionally donep

Looking at the ps, it seems the tail f minecraft.fifo is actually starting in a separate process.  That may be the problem.p  pNote  Im using the SCREEN command to invoke the DAEMON because I needed a way to jump in to a running server and issue commands to it.  So I just screen r as the user minecraft and then I can work with the server.  Once this fifo is working, however, I will no longer need the screen stuff.  So if thats getting in the way, it can be removed.p  pAs for killing it if I put a killall tail in the mcstop, it works.  But that kills all tails and I have others running that I dont want to kill.  So far I havent figured out how to start the server in a way that stores the PID so that I can kill using the PID.  Or to start the tail with a unique process name so that I could killall it without endangering other tails.p  pAny thoughts on how to start the server properly using the named pipe and then how to properly stop itp

Negative 2833 pGood morningp  pIm trying to create a visual waveform for an MP3.  The code Ive included is called on successful load of the MP3.  I intend to extract just a few important samples from the sound to create the waveform, rather than extract the entire sound into a bytearray.

For my purposes, this isnt feasible.p  pUnfortunately, the code Ive got below is failing to produce any numbers.  If I extract the entire song it functions, but extraction of just the key points is giving me nothing.

Negative 2833 pwonder if I could get some advice on the best way to solve this authentication problem.p  pI have a store web application, due to the nature of the store, any user must be authenticated in order to view or use it. Access to the store for all users is through a single login form.p  pThere are 4 levels of user, superuser me, store manager, store worker, and customer.p  pMy problem is what type of authentication to use for each type of user, should it be email based or based on some kind of usernamep  pA store manager will come to our site, and create a new store, and I am happy that they should use an email address and password for authentication. The store manager will then create accounts for store workers and customers. For customers, again, I am happy for them to authenticate with an email address and password. But what should I use for store workers I dont think its appropriate for them to use their personal email address for an account that will be purely professional, what do you think In addition, I can foresee that the manager may create a single worker account, leave it logged in, and all workers will use this one account, so again, an email address would be inappropriate.p  pso these are the solutions I can think of, but all have problemsp  pThe store manager creates store worker accounts that have a username and password. Problem with this is that because all access to the site is through a single login, they could spend ages trying to find a username that has not already been taken.p  pWhen a store worker is created they are assigned a unique login id, e.g 0002014, and together with a password, this can be used to authenticate. Problem with this is that the login id would be hard to remember.p  pI also considered having a username that is somehow combined with the store name which is unique but couldnt think of an elegant way to make it work, it couldnt look like an email address for example.p  pAnyone have a preference on the above or hopefully can suggest a better solution. Thanks for reading.p

Negative 2833 pI have an codeEditTextcode View which is edited by codesetTextcode from my code and by the user via softhard keyboard and  if possible by speech input. I want to handle input made by my code in another way than normal user input if a user input happens, a internal event shall be fired. But I dont know how to differentiate between both. Previously  when developing on the emulator  I used the codeonKeyDowncode method to catch user input. However, when testing on a real device, I found out, that codeonKeyDowncode isnt triggered from soft keyboard input. Additionally speech input wouldnt be recognized by this, though I consider this to be a minor flaw. So that solution is no option for me.p  pOn the other hand there is the codeonTextChangedcode method, but this is triggered by both codesetTextcode and keyboard input. So how can I differentiate between both or which method is only called by user input, but not when using codesetTextcode, so can I overwrite itp

Negative 2833 pI am currently working on defusing a bomb and am on the fourth phase of the bomb, but I have run into a problem. I am not sure what this part of the code means.p  precode    0x08048f64 ltphase481gt        mov    0x804a20c,edx,4,eax     0x08048f6b ltphase488gt        jmp    eax codepre  pI think that this line of code means to input some line of code into eax and jump to it, but not so sure though since I do not know what value s at 0x804a20c. I am a little new to assembly. So far I know that the input has to consist of two numbers and that the second number has to be 126. I am not sure what the first number has to be though. Everytime I run the code with numbers x and 126. X being any number I get to the final step, but in that step it compares the value of 0 in 0x8ebp to the length of the string. Since on line 56 it inputs 0 into 0x8ebp. I am wondering if the above code has anything to do with this.p  pFor example, if I input 100 126 then the program will compare the values of 7 to 0 and not let me jump the last explosion on line 191.p  pHeres the full code.p  precode    0x08048f13 ltphase40gt push   ebp     0x08048f14 ltphase41gt mov    esp,ebp     0x08048f16 ltphase43gt push   ebx     0x08048f17 ltphase44gt sub    0x24,esp     0x08048f1a ltphase47gt lea    0x14ebp,eax     0x08048f1d ltphase410gt        mov    eax,0xcesp     0x08048f21 ltphase414gt        lea    0x10ebp,eax     0x08048f24 ltphase417gt        mov    eax,0x8esp     0x08048f28 ltphase421gt        movl   0x804a206,0x4esp     0x08048f30 ltphase429gt        mov    0x8ebp,eax     0x08048f33 ltphase432gt        mov    eax,esp     0x08048f36 ltphase435gt        call   0x8048b10 ltsscanfpltgt     0x08048f3b ltphase440gt        cmp    0x2,eax     0x08048f3e ltphase443gt        je     0x8048f45 ltphase450gt     0x08048f40 ltphase445gt        call   0x8049e74 ltexplosiongt     0x08048f45 ltphase450gt        mov    0x10ebp,eax     0x08048f48 ltphase453gt        mov    eax,0xcebp     0x08048f4b ltphase456gt        movl   0x0,0x8ebp     0x08048f52 ltphase463gt        mov    0x14ebp,eax     0x08048f55 ltphase466gt        sub    0x74,eax     0x08048f58 ltphase469gt        mov    eax,0x18ebp     0x08048f5b ltphase472gt        cmpl   0xa,0x18ebp     0x08048f5f ltphase476gt        ja     0x8048fb5 ltphase4162gt     0x08048f61 ltphase478gt        mov    0x18ebp,edx     0x08048f64 ltphase481gt        mov    0x804a20c,edx,4,eax     0x08048f6b ltphase488gt        jmp    eax     0x08048f6d ltphase490gt        addl   0x1,0x8ebp     0x08048f71 ltphase494gt        movl   0x72,0xcebp     0x08048f78 ltphase4101gt       shll   0x8ebp     0x08048f7b ltphase4104gt       jmp    0x8048fba ltphase4167gt     0x08048f7d ltphase4106gt       addl   0x38,0xcebp     0x08048f81 ltphase4110gt       addl   0x1,0xcebp     0x08048f85 ltphase4114gt       movl   0x7a,0x8ebp     0x08048f8c ltphase4121gt       jmp    0x8048fba ltphase4167gt     0x08048f8e ltphase4123gt       movl   0x44,0xcebp     0x08048f95 ltphase4130gt       subl   0x1,0xcebp     0x08048f99 ltphase4134gt       shll   0x8ebp     0x08048f9c ltphase4137gt       jmp    0x8048fba ltphase4167gt     0x08048f9e ltphase4139gt       subl   0x1,0x8ebp     0x08048fa2 ltphase4143gt       subl   0x7a,0xcebp     0x08048fa6 ltphase4147gt       jmp    0x8048fba ltphase4167gt     0x08048fa8 ltphase4149gt       movl   0x3,0xcebp     0x08048faf ltphase4156gt       addl   0x1,0x8ebp     0x08048fb3 ltphase4160gt       jmp    0x8048fba ltphase4167gt     0x08048fb5 ltphase4162gt       call   0x8049e74 ltexplosiongt     0x08048fba ltphase4167gt       mov    0xcebp,eax     0x08048fbd ltphase4170gt       imul   0x8ebp,eax     0x08048fc1 ltphase4174gt       mov    eax,ebx     0x08048fc3 ltphase4176gt       mov    0x8ebp,eax     0x08048fc6 ltphase4179gt       mov    eax,esp     0x08048fc9 ltphase4182gt       call   0x8048a20 ltstrlenpltgt     0x08048fce ltphase4187gt       cmp    eax,ebx     0x08048fd0 ltphase4189gt       je     0x8048fd7 ltphase4196gt     0x08048fd2 ltphase4191gt       call   0x8049e74 ltexplosiongt     0x08048fd7 ltphase4196gt       add    0x24,esp     0x08048fda ltphase4199gt       pop    ebx     0x08048fdb ltphase4200gt       pop    ebp     0x08048fdc ltphase4201gt       ret     codepre  pany help is appreciated.

Negative 2833 pI have had trouble finding help in the matlab documentation and previous questions about using matlab inheritance and class constructors to make an interface.

Most of my properties and methods are defined in Super such that codeSub1code and codeSub2code really only exist to use their constructors for simple routines or perhaps a few methods overloaded from Super.p  pSo how do I go about writing the classdefs and constructors to support an interface where I can use the following callsp  precodea  MyPkg.Superargs.Sub1args b  MyPkg.Superargs.Sub1args.Sub1Method codepre  pIn this case I want to keep arguments related to Super apart from arguments related to Sub1 for readability and organization. p  pQuestions are welcome.p  pEDITp  pAfter considering the accepted answer below and some browsing I reached the conclusion that the interface shown above is not really in the spirit of OO and, for my data analysis application of it a more proper way to approach it would consist of a handle class with a constructor that populates an object or cell array of object properties. Because the class is a handle class one can then use the methods on it to produce desired methods. i.e. the followingp  precode in MyPkg  classdef Super lt handle     properties         outputArray     end     methods      function self  Superargs         self.outputArrayloadvaluesargs     end      function out  doanalysisself,params          do some analysis     end      end end codepre  pThen to use thisp  precodedata1  MyPkg.Superargs  Populate the outputArray analysis1  data1.doanalysisparams codepre  petc.,p  pHope that helps someone else dealing with these issuesp

Negative 2833 pSo... I have recently been developing a Winforms C application in .NET 2.0 that uses the Shell Style drag and drop described in the great tutorial here  a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combadamrootarchive20080219shellstyledraganddropinnetwpfandwinforms.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combadamrootarchive20080219shellstyledraganddropinnetwpfandwinforms.aspxap  pThis was used to give a semitransparent image of the dragged control during the drag action. However, a secondary functionality is that files can be dropped onto this panel, and some action carried out based on the files.p  pA custom control has to be able to be dragged from one flow layout panel and dropped into another this all already works, no problems here. My problem occurs when I drag the control in the first panel, and drop it into the same panel i.e. cancelling the drop action. If a file is then dragged onto the panel, the image of the file will be replaced by the image of the former control, the one that was dragged but not dropped If that makes any sensep  pI believed this to be caused by the Image not being disposed of properly, and it appears I was right. I am attempting to use the gdi32.dll DeleteObject method to dispose of the HBitmap created, but this method always returns false.p  pThe code below shows how the HBitmap object is being set, and is being used to create the drag effect. If the DisposeImage method is called before the call to InitializeFromBitmap, the image will be disposed as expected.

Now all of us had added the names and the main repo has been updated with all of our names.p  pMy own repo is a fork from the main repo. It only had some of the names because I was the first ones to add the name. When I pull from the main repo, it asked that I use hg update, this updates my local files with all the names.p  pHeres my questionp  pMy local files are the same as the main repo, but my forked repo does not. I tried to push the updated changes to my repo but it says no changes found.p  pWhat is the proper way to pull changes from the main repo and then push it to my own repop

Negative 2833 pIve been playing around with ASP.net MVC 4s new Display Mode functionality where you can append .Mobile to a display page Index.Mobile.cshtml and it will render the mobile version for mobile devices.  Is it possible to have different controllers for the different user agents  Something like HomeController.Mobile.cs  Ive tried this, but its not working.  Compiler wants HomeController.cs and HomeController.Mobile.cs to be partials.p  pI know I can create a Mobile area and redirect all mobile traffic to that area so mobile devices will have their own controllers.  But, I would prefer to have something like HomeController.Mobile.cs so it makes for a cleaner codebase.  Otherwise, using ASP.net 4s Display Modes the mobile version and the web version of a page will have the same controller logic which is not always needed.  Any thoughts on how to do thisp

Negative 2833 pI have a lot of entities in application and I use JPA implementation for persisting them, therefore most of CRUD methods across DAOs are similar see example class diagram below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comp52LA.png altenter image description herep  pFor this purpose there is interface codeDAOTemplatecode which contains methods available for all entities and is implemented by abstract class codeAbstractDAOcode.p  pSome entities require additional methods such as codefindByEmailcode for codeUsercode entity. For that purpose there is DAO interface with such methods e.g. codeUserDAOcode.p  pNow I want to write integration tests for all methods those in codeDAOTemplatecode and codeUserDAOcode.

The interface has only 3 methods one is fine, but for some reason I cant implement the other two of them without the compiler complaining for each one thatp  ul limy class does not implement InterFaceName.MethodNameli liInterFaceName.MethodName in explicit interface declaration is not a member of interface.li ul  pThe only difference between the one method which compiles and the other two is that the problem methods each have a parameter which is an Office Interop Word type. The other parameters are either bool or members of other public interfaces.p  pI can add my class definition here if it helps, but I would need to do some paraphrasing since Im not the owner of the other assembly it is a commercial product and Im not sure how theyd feel about me exposing it... p  pThats kind of vague I know, but Im hoping someones run into this kind of error before.p  pThanks for any pointers.p
Negative 2833 pI have two view controllers. The CardWallet View Controller is my table view. Then the AddCard View Controller is where I input values for a new instance of an object named Card. So far, I am adding those Card instances in an array named myWallet which is in my CardWallet View Controller using a delegate and it works. p  pWhat I want is, after clicking the button in my AddCard View Controller, a new table cell will appear in my Card Wallet View, with the name depending on the recently added instance of Card. Below is my code, kindly check why is it that when Im finished adding a new instance of Card, nothing appears in my table.

Negative 2833 pI have a WSDL  XSD that needs to be turned into Java classes. Thats pretty simple  codewsimportcode will handle that without issue.

For reference, I know that I can use a hrefhttpconfluence.highsource.orgdisplayJ2BAnnotatePlugin relnofollowAnnoxa to add custom annotations to the generated classes, but as far as Im aware, that would require that either all annotations are identical, with all parameters being identical, or specifying annotations for each element individually, with no way to specify the annotation once along with some way e.g. xpath of specifying that the value of one of the parameters should be different for each element.p  pThat is, given a schema extract likep  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltxsdelement namesmapleRequestgt     ltxsdsequencegt          ltxsdelement nameELEMENTONEgt              ltxsdsimpleTypegt                  ltxsdrestriction basexsdstringgt                      ltxsdlength value3 gt                  ltxsdrestrictiongt              ltxsdsimpleTypegt          ltxsdelementgt          ltxsdelement nameELEMENTTWOgt              ltxsdsimpleTypegt                  ltxsdrestriction basexsdstringgt                      ltxsdmaxLength value8 gt                  ltxsdrestrictiongt              ltxsdsimpleTypegt          ltxsdelementgt     ltxsdsequencegt ltxsdelementgt codepre  pI would like to see classes that look thisp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecode. . .

Negative 2833 pfirst of all, I know there are already a couple of posts here about similar issues, but Ive gone through them and their problems were not mine nor their solutions solve my problem. If anyone has a post which solves my question, please reply with the link and Ill go for it.p  pNow, the problem  Ive got a client and a server. The client requests a file, the server sends it and then the client receives it, or at least thats how it should be. But it is not. What happens instead The client receives the first 1024 bytes, then the next 1024 bytes, and then receives 436 bytes Im always using the same file so I always get the same results and ends because it has received less than 1024 bytes and therefore it has deducted than it was the last read it had to perform, but it shouldnt be, because the server, when reading the file from its FileInputStream, reads much more bytes much more pieces of 1024 bytes. Ive tried everything Ive imagined, but Ive got no positive result Always, the third piece, instead of being whole received, is just received up to the byte 436 maybe what happens is that, from the third piece up to the penultimate are skipped for some reason, and then the last one is 436 bytes and is received, althought I dont think this is the case since the whole file isnt read in the server because the client closes the connection as soon as it thinks the transmission has finished, provoking an exception on the server that interrupts it from reading anything.p  pAnd here goes what I think is the key codep  pServerp  precodeOutputStream put         try              ServerSocket serverSocket             try                  serverSocket  new ServerSocketDesktopClient.PORTFORFILES              catch IOException ex                  JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, ex.toString, Error, JOptionPane.ERRORMESSAGE                 return false                          Socket socket             try                  socket  serverSocket.accept                 ActionWindow.printlnConnection for files transference stablished    socket              catch Exception ex                  JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, ex.toString, Error, JOptionPane.ERRORMESSAGE                 return false                          put  socket.getOutputStream             BufferedReader requestedVideoBufferedReader  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReadersocket.getInputStream             String requiredVideo  requestedVideoBufferedReader.readLine             while requiredVideo.matchesfinish ampamp requiredVideo.matcheserrored                  ActionWindow.printlnThe screen in the router   ActionWindow.currentConn   is asking for   requiredVideo                 if new FileActionWindow.pathToVideosFolder  requiredVideo  ActionWindow.videoFilesExtension.exists                      try InputStream in  new FileInputStreamActionWindow.pathToVideosFolder  requiredVideo  ActionWindow.videoFilesExtension                          byte[] buf  new byte[1024]                         int len                         System.out.printlnAbout to write                         while true                              len  in.readbuf                             System.out.printlnlen   len                             if len gt 0                                  put.writebuf, 0, len                              else                                  break                                                                                                ActionWindow.printlnFile   requiredVideo  ActionWindow.videoFilesExtension   sent.                  else                      ActionWindow.printlnFile   requiredVideo  ActionWindow.videoFilesExtension   couldnt be found in the local index.                     put.close                     socket.close                     serverSocket.close                     return false                                  requiredVideo  requestedVideoBufferedReader.readLine                          if requiredVideo.matcheserrored                  JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Se produjo un error en la transmisin de archivos.

Negative 2833 pI have a Web Application ASP.NET application developed with C and .NET Framework 3.5 that uses the SAP.NET Connector to call some BAPIs on a standard SAP R3 installation. So far things work fine. The BAPIs are called to insert information in a couple of SAP tables from the Web App. p  pHowever, today the customer requested to add to those SAP tables further data. After reviewing with the SAP team, they concluded that doing such task would require the Web App to invoke several dozens of different BAPIs. As such, they decided to create a Z Function that would take many parameters and insert the values where needed. p  pSince I need to change the Web App, I was required to approve this line of action. However 1 I dont know what a Z Function is, and 2 dont know whether the SAP.NET connector. To solve 1, I googled for a while, yet found no significant result. From what I can tell, a Z Function is a custom ordinary function created by an ABAP programmer. As for 2, I know that the SAP.NET connector can invoke both BAPIs and Remote Function Calls, or RFCs. However I am unsure as to whether a Z Function can be invoked through RFCs.p  pSo this is where Im stuck. Any help on this matter either letting me know what a Z Function is, and how is it different from an RFC, or whether it can be invoked from SAP.NET connector will be really appreciated and will earn my eternal gratitude. p

The codedynscatcode function declaration was missing altogether again, adding it quells a warning.p  pWith the code fragment shown, its clear that only the address of the variable is used, so it makes sense at one level that it does not matter that the details of the structure are not known.  Were the variable codeextern struct tdynstr pparsevalcode, youd not be seeing this question that would be 100 expected.  If the code needed to access the internals of the structure, then the structure definition would be needed.  But Id always expected that if you declared that the variable was a structure rather than a pointer to the structure, the compiler would want to know the size of the structure  but apparently not.p  pIve tried provoking GCC into complaining, but it doesnt, even GCC 4.7.1p  precodegcc4.7.1 c Wall Wextra stdc89 pedantic surprise.c codepre  pThe code has been compiling on AIX, HPUX, Solaris, Linux for a decade, so it isnt GCCspecific that it is accepted.p  h3Questionh3  pIs this allowed by the C standard primarily C99 or C11, but C89 will do too  Which section  Or have I just hit on an oddball case that works on all the machines its ported to but isnt formally sanctioned by the standardp

Negative 2833 pIve been trying to find out how to be notified i.e. have a handler when user edits or adds a new row in the DataGrid. As for editing, the closest I could find is RowEditEnding handler, but the problem with that handler is that I cant access the new values of the cells in the row being edited. This handler has only the old values, cause the event is triggered right before the data is committed.p  pAnyways, the list that is bound to the DataGrid is being properly updated both on edit and add, but what I want is to do appropriate SQL queries and update the sql table cause the list is made out of data pulled from the Database.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 2833 pWhen I write a function call like this myfunction [a b c] in Clojure. How does Clojure find myfunction Does it perform a lookup from globalpernamespace symbol tablep  pIm assuming the symbol table is implemented as a hashtable which provides O1 time complexity for lookup. It  also needs to compare the function name as a string with the symbol from the table which should take On time n is the length of the symbol. It means the longer of the symbol the slower the name resolution would be. Is it correctp

Negative 2833 pLike the title says Is there a way to change the template which VS uses to create the designer file For example the naming conventions for controls or its events. I did some research on it, but was only able to find some older posts, which were basically saying no its not, maybe something has changed in the last couple months or so...p  pI was able to identify the folder where the default templates for creating the class which is created in the beginning CProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0Common7IDEItemTemplatesCSharpWindows Forms1033. But Im still searching for the template which generates the eventmethods and so on...p  pEdit Sorry if I mixed up my question. As Basti stated, I do look for both, changing the class template you can do that by changig the template files, found in the VS directory CProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0Common7IDEItemTemplates and also changing the naming convention for generating fields, eventnames and so on.p
Negative 2833 pThis bug is really making my head hurt. For some reason my table has a 1px gap on the left and right side of the middle cell. I have no idea what is causing this. You can see an example here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netJdayW1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netJdayW1ap  pWhat I need to have is an image in the middle cell that acts as a mask so you can see the background image behind it. There needs to be a solid color to the left and right of the image that stretches to the edges of the browser window. I figured a table was the best way to achieve this.. but I could be wrong. The gaps go away when I put a background color on the middle cell or the entire table, but obviously that is not going to work for me because I cannot have a background color behind the image.p  pIn the site Im building this mask image with transparency will scroll over the the fixed background behind it. So I cannot just make the png a jpg with the background on it.p  pIs this happening because I have the table set to codewidth100code and the middle cell set to a fixed 300px widthp
Negative 2833 pIm developing a small adhoc replication framework for a reatil company, which replicates only certain records of certain tables about 200 depending on specific domainlevel logic.p  pIn order to know the replication status of each record for each target host, I have a strongrepStatusstrong emcharacteremNUMBEROFHOSTS type column where a host always represents the same position.p  pThe values in each position of this column could be strong0strong emno actionem, strong1strong emreplicate recordem, strong2strong emrecord replicatedem, strong3strong emresend after confirmationem, strongAstrong emfirst time errorem, strongBstrong emsecond time errorem... etc.p  pSo for instance strong012Astrong means p  ul liDont send anything to host 1li liSend this record to host 2li liRecord correctly received in host 3li liError received from host 3li ul  pThis looks pretty easy and simple, and has a emstraightforward readingem in order to know the status of a record, I simply read the strongrepStatusstrong column.p  pHowever, looks like this approach leads to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13183735queryperformanceinpostgresqlusingsimilartoperformance problems when the application has to look for the target records to replicatea.p  pSo Im sure theres a better design to solve this problem performancewise.

Negative 2833 pI wish I could be more specific here, but unfortunately this might be hard. I basically hope this is some wellknown timeout or setup issue.p  pWe have a website running an JShtml  ASP.net project website overview on a screen at a factory. This screen has no keyboard so it should keep refreshing the page forever  years perhaps though 1 week might be okay. It is used by factory workers to see incoming transports etc.p  pThis all works perfectly the site continuously updates itself and gets the new correct data. Then, sometimes, in the morning this overview screen has no data and the workers have to manually refresh the site using the simple refresh button or F5  which fixes everything.p  pI have tried a few things trying to reproduce the error myself includingp  ol liCutting the internet  connection and MANY other ways of making it timeout breakpoints, stopping services etc..li liSetting the refresh time of setInterval to 100ms and letting the site run 35 minutes. normal timer is 1 minuteli lisetInterval SHOULD run forever according to the internet searching I have done.li liChecked that JavaScript frequency has not been turned down in power saving settings.li ol  pNo matter what the site resumes correct function WITHOUT a refresh as soon as I plug in the internet cable or whatever again  I cant reproduce the error.p  pThe website is dependent on a backend WCF service and project integration, but since the workers are fixing this with a simple refresh I am assuming this has not crashed.p  pEDIT The browser I tried to reproduce the error in was IEwin7. I will ask about the factory tomorrow, but I am guessing IEwin also.p  pIs setInterval in fact really infinite or is there something else wrong herep  pAll help much appreciated.p  pUPDATE I came in this morning after leaving the website running in debug mode with a breakpoint in the catch clause of the site updating code. There was a 2 min. timeout error busy server cleanup during the night likely and THEN forever after that a nullreference error at this linep  precodevar showHistory  boolSession.Contents[ShowHistory] codepre  pI fixed it with a refresh like the workers. I am now thinking it may be a session timeout all though we keep pinging the server.. Of course my particular session timeout may have been caused by the breakpoint making it hang forever at the first timeout  still the behavior is the same as at the factory. I will make sure to update you guys with the final solution later.p  pUPDATE 2 Testing is ongoing.p  pUPDATE 3 The factory is IE 9, their test machine is IE 7 and my machine is IE 9. The error was seen on IE7 but NOT my IE9 after a weekends runtime. We tried turning off ajax cache during our critical databinding code, but it did nothing. I tested for memory leaks and was able to create a decent leak IF I refresh 100 times per minute. I dont think it was the problem though and a refresh cleaned the memory used.p  pWe will try the autorefresh thing now.p

The compiler should exit after first error is encountered.

Negative 2833 pIm trying to get back into PHP and MySQL development since ive found out that MySQL now allows stored procedures. I work with these at work on an Oracle database and use PLSQL developer to create them. I was looking for a similar sort of interface for MySQL and was pointed in the direction of MySQL workbench. Im using Xampp as my test server setup and would like to link MySQL Workbench to MySQL on this server however Im stuck at one of the stages in the installation. Im trying to create a new server instance and have been successful as far as testing the database connection however on the next page it asks me to set the windows configuration parameters for this machine and failes to discover a MySQL service. I have ensured that both the Apache server and MySQL services are running in Xampp but do not understand why a MySQL service cannot be found and is not being displayed. Has anyone else encountered this issue when trying to use MySQL Workbench and if so, how did you amanage to get it up and running Im using Windows 8 and dont know if this is the reason a service isnt being found. I apologise if this is a really simple question with a simple answer however I have only ever used PHPMyAdmin before which is relatively simple to setup.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwaqsQ.jpg altNo service foundp

Negative 2833 pI found a a hrefhttpwhattheemacsd.comsetupshell.el01.html relnofollownice posta a few days ago detailing how to kill the shell buffer with the codeCdcode key. Basically, after killing the process with codeCdcode you can now tap codeCdcode again to also kill the buffer.p  pI was trying to implement something similar for termmode, but I ran into a problem. After you kill the term process with the usual codeCdcode it seems that the keymap being used by the buffer changes, but I cant find out what it isp  pFor example, launch the codetermcode command codeMx term RET RETcode and then just immediatelly hit codeCdcode. Once the process is dead, the buffer still reports being in termmode, but they keymap its using is neither codetermmodemapcode nor codetermrawmapcode.p  pstrongSostrongbr I either need to find out what map it is using so I can bind codeCdcode to codekillbuffercode.br Or I need another way to kill the buffer with codeCdcode in termmode.p
Negative 2833 pIn a WPF application, I have a class that receives messages over the network. Whenever an object of said class has received a full message, an event is raised. In the MainWindow of the application I have an event handler subscribed to that event. The event handler is guaranteed to be called on the GUI thread of the application.p  pWhenever the event handler is called, the contents of the message needs to be applied to the model. Doing so can be quite costly 200ms on current hardware. Thats why applying the message is offloaded onto the thread pool with Task.Run.p  pNow, messages can be received in very close succession, so the event handler can be called while a previous change is still being processed. What is the simplest way to ensure that messages are only applied one at time So far, Ive come up with the followingp  precodeusing System using System.Threading.Tasks using System.Windows  public partial class MainWindow  Window      private Model model  new Model     private Task pending  Task.FromResultltboolgtfalse       Assume e carries a message received over the network.     private void OnMessageReceivedobject sender, EventArgs e              this.pending  ApplyToModele           private async Task ApplyToModelEventArgs e              await this.pending         await Task.Run gt this.model.Applye  Assume this is an expensive call.       codepre  pThis seems to work as expected, however it also appears this will inevitably produce a memory leak, because the task to apply a message will always first wait on the task that applied the previous message. If so, then the following change should avoid the leakp  precodeprivate async Task ApplyToModelEventArgs e      if this.pending.IsCompleted              await this.pending           await Task.Run gt this.model.Applye  codepre  pIs this a sensible way to avoid reentrancy with async void event handlersp  pstrongEDITstrong Removed the unnecessary codeawait this.pendingcode statement in codeOnMessageReceivedcode.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong The messages must be applied to the model in the same order in which they have been received.p

Negative 2833 pIm a little bit confused concerning virtual functions.p  pLets suppose you have Base class with virtual function foo, and that function then overridden in Derived classp  precode   class Baseclass          public        virtual void foo                    ...                 class Derived public BaseClass        private        int memberval    public        Derived int init              memberval init                 void foo                    memberval             codepre  pand foo using member value of Derived class, when i write this codep  precodeDerived d 10  Base bPtr  ampd bPtrgtfoo  codepre  pfoo called for Derived class because vptr points on Derived class virtual table, and pointer in Derived class virtual table points on foo from Derived class, but how then it found memberval, cause Base pointer doesnt know about it. What this is passed to foo from Derived class. We call it for Base this is Base type but to find memberval we need Derived  this Derived type. So how it works under the hoodp

Negative 2833 pI have a table called Table A that has an strongalivestrong column. This column can be 1 or 0. If it is 0 then it means that it has been deleted. This is a soft delete.p  pThe problem I have is that I want to verify foreign key constraints on rows in this table. If I was to delete a row from Table A then more often than not it would through foreign key constraints because of its relationship with other rows. This is good and expected. The problem I have is that as my deletions are soft just updating a flag I do not get any constraint checking when I delete. This means that I need to check the relationships manually.p  pIs there anyway I can add a constraint to an oracle table which uses the 1 and 0 as part of the integrity constraint For example if I update strongalivestrong column to 0 it will then hit the constraint and so will not allow the column to be changed to 0.p  pCan I do this somehowp  pHope this makes sense.p  pThanksp

Negative 2833 pMy team is writing an application with GAE Java that has led me to question the scalability of entity relationship modeling specifically manytomany in object oriented databases like BigTable.p  pThe preferred solution for modeling unowned onetomany and manytomany relationships in the App Engine Datastore see a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocsjavadatastorejdorelationshipshlen relnofollowEntity Relationships in JDOa seems to be listofkeys. However, Google warnsp  blockquote   pThere are a few limitations to implementing manytomany   relationships this way. First, you must explicitly retrieve the values   on the side of the collection where the list is stored since all you   have available are Key objects. Another more important one is that you   want to avoid storing overly large lists of keys...p blockquote  pSpeaking of emoverly large lists of keysem, if you attempt to model this way and assume that you are storing one Long for each key then with a perentity limit of 1MB the theoretical maximum number of relationships per entity is 130k. For a platform whos primary advantage is scalabililty, thats really not that many relationships. So now we are looking at possibly sharding entities which require more than 130k relationships.p  pA different approach Relationship Model is outlined in the article a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginearticlesmodeling relnofollowModeling Entity Relationshipsa as part of the Mastering the datastore series in the AppEngine developer resources. However, even here Google warns about the performance of relational modelsp  blockquote   pHowever, you need to be very careful because traversing the   connections of a collection will require more calls to the datastore.   Use this kind of manytomany relationship only when you really need   to, and do so with care to the performance of your application.p blockquote  pSo by now you are asking strongWhy do you need more than 130k relationships perentitystrong Well Im glad you asked. Lets take, for example, a CMS application with say 1 million users Hey I can dream rightp  pUsers can upload content and share it with  1. public  2. individuals  3. groups  4. any combinationp  pNow someone logs in, and navigates to a dashboard that shows new uploads from people they are connected to in any group. This dashboard should include public content, and content shared specifically with this user or a group this user is a member of. Not too bad right Lets dig into it. p  precodepublic class Content    private Long id   private Long authorId   private ListltLonggt sharedWith can be individual ids or group ids  codepre  pNow my query to get everything an id is allowed to see might look like thisp  precodeListltLonggt idsThatGiveMeAccess  new ArrayListltLonggt idsThatGiveMeAccess.addmyId idsThatGiveMeAccess.addpublicId Lets say that sharing with 0L makes it public for Group g  groupsImIn     idsThatGiveMeAccess.addg.getId  ListltLonggt authorIdsThatIWantToSee  new ArrayListltLonggt Add a bunch of authorIds  Query q  new QueryContent             .addFilterauthorId, Query.FilterOperator.IN, authorIdsThatIWantToSee             .addFiltersharedWith, Query.FilterOperator.IN, idsThatGiveMeAccess codepre  pObviously Ive already broken several rules. Namely, using two IN filters will blow up. Even a single IN filter at any size approaching the limits we are talking about would blow up. Aside from all that, lets say I want to limit and page through the results... no no You cant do that if you use an IN filter. I cant think of any way to do this operation in a single query  which means you cant paginate it without extensive readtime processing and managing multiple cursors.p  pSo here are the tools I can think of for doing this denormalization, sharding, or relationship entities. However even with these concepts I dont see how it is possible to model this data in a way that could scale. Obviously its possible. Google and others do it all the time. I just cant see how. strongCan anyone shed any light on how to model this or point me toward any good resources for cmsstyle access control based on NoSQL DBstrongp

Negative 2833 pstrongFirst, let me describe the applicationstrong we are working on a webbased software which is some kind of custom help desk application. It requires the user to login we use strongFOSUserBundlestrong. After login the user is redirected to the dashboard. From the dashboard there is no more page reload, the frontend is build on Angularjs and the user can get anywhere within the application without page reload. You could speak of a single page application.p  pSo the data that is presented to the user, is fetched from a rest api we use strongFOSRestBundlestrong. This works quite well at this point. p  pThere is some kind of dilemma. Only our staff will access this application for now. So a staff member needs to login to access the helpdesk. The data that is pushed to the frontend via angularjs is called via api, so the user that has just logged in needs to authenticate again on every request because of rest.p  pstrongProblemstrong Since the backend runs on symfony2 let us just try to get the user object of the currently logged in user when an api call is madep  precodethisgtgetsecurity.contextgtgetTokengtgetUser codepre  preturns stronganon.strong that stands for anonymous, orp  precodethisgtgetUser codepre  preturns just strongnullstrong.p  pSo the authenticated context seems to be gone when using the rest api. However when I call an action directly without rest, I can get user information.p  pSo what we need is to secure our rest api and get user information on every api call. We dont want third party people to access our application, just staff. I am not familar with OAuth, but the user will be redirected to a third party page to AllowDeny access to his data This would not be an option for us.p  pBased on that information, do you have any suggestions or ideas how to secure the api and transport the user data so that getUser does not return null or anon. but the actuall logged in userp

The eclipse process running is javaw.exe. Is this outofmemory behavior expected even for Helloworld using soot Im new to running profiling for java and im not sure if the library classes are adding a huge overhead.p  pOR maybe the right question is  how do i use the Xmx switch for running Soot with more memory in Eclipse on Windows anyone done this p  pThe command in Eclipse is below. Im using some simplification options in Spark Analysis. p  precodesoot.Main     w d CUsersnbalajiworkspaceHelloWorldsootOutput  processpath CUsersnbalajiworkspaceHelloWorldsrc     cp CUsersnbalajiworkspaceHelloWorldbin, lt bunch of Javajre7 files gt codepre  pstrongEditstrong This is resolved now. From the Soot survival guide When setting up a run conguration you should add the following parameters to the JVM Xmx512m Xss256m to increase the VM memory.p

Negative 2833 pallp  pI noticed that Powershell, or more specifically, pasting and tabcompleting within Powershell, was a lot slower on my machine after upgrading to v3 from v2. I opened up strongprocmonstrong to see  what was going on, only to find out that emeveryem attempt to tabcomplete or paste anything triggers Powershell to find various permutations of the file provided in the subject. I have some network folders in my PATH and walking through those folders every time I paste something seems nonideal. p  pIt seems that this file allows Powershell to behave more like Bash. While this is absolutely FANTASTIC and Im looking forward to abusing this feature in the very near future, is there any way to configure Powershell such that it only attempts to find this file in emoneem directory p  pThanksp

Negative 2833 pIm trying to write a program that compares each item in a list against the text of a document. The program should then return a new list with a value appended to each item of how many times it matched up against a word in the document. I have a function written that actually does the matching and it works fine on its own. The loop that does the counting also works for single entries. However, when I try to run it for all the entries of the list, it comes back with the proper number for the first list entry and then just gives zeroes back for the rest.p  pHeres an idea of what it looks likep  precode    doc  openC...     list  [string1, string2, string3, ...]     answer  []     ...

However, I do want to reset the counter for each list item and I havent included the counter  0 in the actual for statement where the calculation is done. p  pI have a feeling that it may have to do with the placement of the counter  0 assignment, but if I place it outside the for t in list loop, then it just returns the same value for every list entry.p

Negative 2833 pIn JUnit 4, I am looking to write a test suite that is made up of multiple flavors of the same test case, just with different initial conditions on each one. Here is an examplep  precodeimport java.io.File  import org.junit.runner.RunWith import org.junit.runners.Suite import org.junit.runners.Suite.SuiteClasses  RunWithSuite.class SuiteClassesMultiInputClientServerIntegrationTest.NormalInput.class,     MultiInputClientServerIntegrationTest.SimulationHashIssue.class public class MultiInputClientServerIntegrationTest      RunWithSuite.class   SuiteClassesTestClientServerIntegration.class   public class NormalInput        RunWithSuite.class   SuiteClassesTestClientServerIntegration.class   public class SimulationHashIssue        public SimulationHashIssue        TestClientServerIntegration.simulation  new FiletestBEECHA01sim2.zip       TestClientServerIntegration.inputFile  filesconfig.in            codepre  pAs you can see, both inner classes have SuiteClasses of the codeTestClientServerIntegration.classcode but the second one is changing some static variable values. I am finding that this constructor never gets called, so these statics never get changed.p  pMy end goal is to run this codeTestClientServerIntegration.classcode over and over with multiple types of input. If I can run a test suite this way, that would be ideal  so hopefully it is possible. Id like to do as little hacking of JUnit as possible, but what needs to get done will get done.p

Negative 2833 pThere are scenarios where I find myself writing markup code like thisp  precodeltdiv ngrepeatchapter in data.Chaptersgt     lttablegt         lttr ngrepeatrow in data.Rowsgt             lttd ngrepeatcolumn in data.Columnsgt                 chapter.Values[parent.index][index].V             lttdgt         lttrgt     lttablegt ltdivgt codepre  pThe final binding expression can get complex, and if you imagine scenarios where codechapter.Values[parent.index][index]code is a complex object and you have to access all of its properties, then those bindings get long and noisy. I wrote a simple directive that allows me to change my markup to thisp  precodeltdiv ngrepeatchapter in data.Chaptersgt     lttablegt         lttr ngrepeatrow in data.Rowsgt             lttd ngrepeatcolumn in data.Columns                 appendcontext nameitem                 expressionchapter.Values[parent.index][index]gt                 item.V             lttdgt         lttrgt     lttablegt ltdivgt codepre  pNow, after using my codeappendcontextcode directive code omitted, but its trivial, I can refer to my object with an emaliasem codeitemcode which greatly simplifies readability.p  pI have mixed feelings with this because the directive is not really emextending HTMLem in terms of enhancing its layouting capabilities, what it really does is really related to scope management. I have other contexts where I used a similar approach to handle things like, for example, heavy redraws transparently introducing codesetTimeoutcode calls through specific directives, again not strictly related to HTML rendering.p  pDo you think its a legitimate approach, or just a trick to solve a problem that should have been solved in a different way in the first placep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pHere the mentioned directivep  precodeangular.moduledirectives, []     .directiveappendContext, function           return              restrict A,             controller function scope, attrs                  var expression  attrs.expression,                     name  attrs.name                 scope[name]  scope.evalexpression                            codepre  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pDavidChase has a good point in his comment, although I still have mixed feelings about creating a emgeneral purposeem controller but its very likely its just me.

One of these connections will be reserved for a user with  SUPER privileges to allow the administrator to login even if the  connection limit has been reached. maxconnections100   Query cache is used to cache SELECT results and later return them  without actual executing the same query once again. Having the query  cache enabled may result in significant speed improvements, if your  have a lot of identical queries and rarely changing tables. See the  Qcachelowmemprunes status variable to check if the current value  is high enough for your load.  Note In case your tables change very often or if your queries are  textually different every time, the query cache may result in a  slowdown instead of a performance improvement. querycachesize0   The number of open tables for all threads. Increasing this value  increases the number of file descriptors that mysqld requires.  Therefore you have to make sure to set the amount of open files  allowed to at least 4096 in the variable openfileslimit in  section [mysqldsafe] tableopencache2000   Maximum size for internal inmemory temporary tables. If a table  grows larger than this value, it is automatically converted to disk  based table This limitation is for a single table. There can be many  of them. tmptablesize114M tmptablesize1140M   How many threads we should keep in a cache for reuse. When a client  disconnects, the clients threads are put in the cache if there arent  more than threadcachesize threads from before.  This greatly reduces  the amount of thread creations needed if you have a lot of new  connections. Normally this doesnt give a notable performance  improvement if you have a good thread implementation. threadcachesize9   MyISAM Specific options  The maximum size of the temporary file MySQL is allowed to use while  recreating the index during REPAIR, ALTER TABLE or LOAD DATA INFILE.  If the filesize would be bigger than this, the index will be created  through the key cache which is slower. myisammaxsortfilesize100G   If the temporary file used for fast index creation would be bigger  than using the key cache by the amount specified here, then prefer the  key cache method.  This is mainly used to force long character keys in  large tables to use the slower key cache method to create the index. myisamsortbuffersize227M   Size of the Key Buffer, used to cache index blocks for MyISAM tables.  Do not set it larger than 30 of your available memory, as some memory  is also required by the OS to cache rows. Even if youre not using  MyISAM tables, you should still set it to 864M as it will also be  used for internal temporary disk tables. keybuffersize8M   Size of the buffer used for doing full table scans of MyISAM tables.  Allocated per thread, if a full scan is needed. readbuffersize64K readrndbuffersize256K     This buffer is allocated when MySQL needs to rebuild the index in  REPAIR, OPTIMZE, ALTER table statements as well as in LOAD DATA INFILE  into an empty table. It is allocated per thread so be careful with  large settings. sortbuffersize256K    INNODB Specific options   innodbdatahomedir0.0   Use this option if you have a MySQL server with InnoDB support enabled  but you do not plan to use it. This will save memory and disk space  and speed up some things.  skipinnodb   Additional memory pool that is used by InnoDB to store metadata  information.  If InnoDB requires more memory for this purpose it will  start to allocate it from the OS.  As this is fast enough on most  recent operating systems, you normally do not need to change this  value. SHOW INNODB STATUS will display the current amount used. innodbadditionalmempoolsize16M   If set to 1, InnoDB will flush fsync the transaction logs to the  disk at each commit, which offers full ACID behavior. If you are  willing to compromise this safety, and you are running small  transactions, you may set this to 0 or 2 to reduce disk IO to the  logs. Value 0 means that the log is only written to the log file and  the log file flushed to disk approximately once per second. Value 2  means the log is written to the log file at each commit, but the log  file is only flushed to disk approximately once per second. innodbflushlogattrxcommit1    The size of the buffer InnoDB uses for buffering log data. As soon as  it is full, InnoDB will have to flush it to disk. As it is flushed  once per second anyway, it does not make sense to have it very large  even with long transactions. innodblogbuffersize8M    InnoDB, unlike MyISAM, uses a buffer pool to cache both indexes and  row data. The bigger you set this the less disk IO is needed to  access data in tables. On a dedicated database server you may set this  parameter up to 80 of the machine physical memory size. Do not set it  too large, though, because competition of the physical memory may  cause paging in the operating system.  Note that on 32bit systems you  might be limited to 23.5G of user level memory per process, so do not  set it too high. innodbbufferpoolsize735M    Size of each log file in a log group. You should set the combined size  of log files to about 25100 of your buffer pool size to avoid  unneeded buffer pool flush activity on log file overwrite. However,  note that a larger logfile size will increase the time needed for the  recovery process. innodblogfilesize48M   Number of threads allowed inside the InnoDB kernel. The optimal value  depends highly on the application, hardware as well as the OS  scheduler properties. A too high value may lead to thread thrashing. innodbthreadconcurrency17   The increment size in MB for extending the size of an autoextend InnoDB system tablespace file when it becomes full. innodbautoextendincrement64M   The number of regions that the InnoDB buffer pool is divided into.  For systems with buffer pools in the multigigabyte range, dividing the buffer pool into separate instances can improve concurrency,  by reducing contention as different threads read and write to cached pages. innodbbufferpoolinstances8   Determines the number of threads that can enter InnoDB concurrently. innodbconcurrencytickets5000   Specifies how long in milliseconds ms a block inserted into the old sublist must stay there after its first access before  it can be moved to the new sublist. innodboldblockstime1000   It specifies the maximum number of .ibd files that MySQL can keep open at one time. The minimum value is 10. innodbopenfiles300   When this variable is enabled, InnoDB updates statistics during metadata statements. innodbstatsonmetadata0   When innodbfilepertable is enabled the default in 5.6.6 and higher, InnoDB stores the data and indexes for each newly created table  in a separate .ibd file, rather than in the system tablespace. innodbfilepertable1   Use the following list of values 0 for crc32, 1 for strictcrc32, 2 for innodb, 3 for strictinnodb, 4 for none, 5 for strictnone. innodbchecksumalgorithm0   The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can have.  This option is useful when the main MySQL thread gets many connection requests in a very short time.  It then takes some time although very little for the main thread to check the connection and start a new thread.  The backlog value indicates how many requests can be stacked during this short time before MySQL momentarily  stops answering new requests.  You need to increase this only if you expect a large number of connections in a short period of time. backlog70   If this is set to a nonzero value, all tables are closed every flushtime seconds to free up resources and  synchronize unflushed data to disk.  This option is best used only on systems with minimal resources. flushtime0   The minimum size of the buffer that is used for plain index scans, range index scans, and joins that do not use  indexes and thus perform full table scans. joinbuffersize256K   The maximum size of one packet or any generated or intermediate string, or any parameter sent by the  mysqlstmtsendlongdata C API function. maxallowedpacket4M   If more than this many successive connection requests from a host are interrupted without a successful connection,  the server blocks that host from performing further connections. maxconnecterrors100   Changes the number of file descriptors available to mysqld.  You should try increasing the value of this option if mysqld gives you the error Too many open files. openfileslimit4110   Set the query cache type. 0 for OFF, 1 for ON and 2 for DEMAND. querycachetype0   If you see many sortmergepasses per second in SHOW GLOBAL STATUS output, you can consider increasing the  sortbuffersize value to speed up ORDER BY or GROUP BY operations that cannot be improved with query optimization  or improved indexing. sortbuffersize256K   The number of table definitions from .frm files that can be stored in the definition cache.  If you use a large number of tables, you can create a large table definition cache to speed up opening of tables.  The table definition cache takes less space and does not use file descriptors, unlike the normal table cache.  The minimum and default values are both 400. tabledefinitioncache1400   Specify the maximum size of a rowbased binary log event, in bytes.  Rows are grouped into events smaller than this size if possible. The value should be a multiple of 256. binlogroweventmaxsize8K   If the value of this variable is greater than 0, a replication slave synchronizes its master.info file to disk.  using fdatasync after every syncmasterinfo events. syncmasterinfo10000   If the value of this variable is greater than 0, the MySQL server synchronizes its relay log to disk.  using fdatasync after every syncrelaylog writes to the relay log. syncrelaylog10000   If the value of this variable is greater than 0, a replication slave synchronizes its relaylog.info file to disk.  using fdatasync after every syncrelayloginfo transactions. syncrelayloginfo10000 codepre

Negative 2833 pI am working on a client project and I am trying to improve the process of passing variables from a url to php.

This works perfectly.p  pNow to my problem When the passed variable contains special chars like a slash  or an ampersand amp it does not work anymore, because the browser thinks he is searching for a subdirectory. e.g. variable doesnotexist  Browser tries to open a hrefhttpxyz.comdoesnotexist relnofollowhttpxyz.comdoesnotexista. At the moment Im replacing such characters like a slash with others that are no problems in a url before encoding. So I replace  with , or amp with , encode it and everything is fine. In my php script I decode it and replace , with  and  with amp and so one. This works, but is really ugly, so I am searching for a better way to do it.p  pThe initial url structure can not be changed. Does anyone know a better way to do this Im stuck here. One idea would be to baseencode the whole url parameter, but this is not the way I want it, because the url should be readable.p

Note that this works differently between WebAPI and MVC4.  Specifically for controllers returning a Task, but as far as I can tell nontask returning controllers for the WebAPI do not have this capability either.  What is interesting is that that first linked question implements a homegrown manual timeout which while clever, that doesnt seem like something that should be handled at that level.

Negative 2833 pI know this question has been asked ad nauseam but somehow I cant make it work properly. I created a single, sine wave of 440 Hz having  a unit amplitude. Now, after the FFT, the bin at 440 Hz has a distinct peak but the value just isnt right. Id expect to see 0 dB since Im dealing with a unit amplitude sine wave. Instead, the power calculated is well above 0 dB. The formula Im using is simplyp  precodefor int i  0 i lt N2 i         mag  sqrtReal[i]Real[i]  Img[i]Img[i]N0.54 0.54 correction for a Hamming Window      Mag[i]  10  logmag         codepre  pI should probably point out that the total energy in the time domain is equal to the energy in the frequency domain Parsevals theorem, so I know that my FFT routine is fine.p  pAny help is much appreciated.p

Negative 2833 pI am about to do clustering with feature vectors of 1000 dimension. that is, feature vectors are like the below. a  255, 2334, 436, ... , 5284 b  235, 434, 63, ... , 844 ... I have also the metric to measure the distance between 2 feature vectors. but i cant figure out which clustering algorithm does clustering with this feature vectors the best because i cant visualize the distribution of these vectors due to high dimension. Anyone knows the method which can visualize these distribution, or in condition of not knowing the distribution of data, how to select the best clustering algorithm Thanks in advance.p

Negative 2833 pI think Im going to have separate datasources for various functions.

Under Owned Schemas, Ive gotten into the habit of checking dbowner and under Role Members, I check dbowner.p  pI got it to work that way and havent looked back.  So now Im looking back and wonder, does this give my ColdFusion datasource more rights than it needs to have  Is there another option under Owned Schemas andor Role Members that could minimize my exposurep  pHeck, Id be ok with reducing the number of features as long as I knew what features I would be turning off.  For instance, I never alter a table from ColdFusion.p  pSome people advise to only allow stored procedures and never allow updating tables directly from the application, but Im not following that advice.p

Negative 2833 pIm hoping someone can help me out with this problem. I have a very tall view with three different content section. For the sake of simplicity I will say that the UIView in Interface Builder is 1000px tall, each section is 300px tall, and there is a 50px margin between sections. Each section can be visible or hidden depending on the underlying data. So you could have 1,2, and 3 visible. Or 1 and 3. Or 1 and 2. Or just 3. Etc.....p  pIn Interface Builder I set up all the constraints except for the vertical constraints that link the sections together and the constraints that link the sections to the top and bottom of the parent view. Those are all added at run time depending what sections are showing.p  precode    sample code      add constraint from top of view to first section     NSLayoutConstraint topConstraint  [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemself.view attributeNSLayoutAttributeTop relatedByNSLayoutRelationEqual toItemsection1 attributeNSLayoutAttributeTop multiplier1.0 constant0]     [self.view addConstrainttopConstraint]      add constraint between sections     NSLayoutConstraint constraint  [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemsection1 attributeNSLayoutAttributeBottom relatedByNSLayoutRelationEqual toItemsection2 attributeNSLayoutAttributeTop multiplier1.0 constant50.0]     [self.view addConstraintconstraint]      add constraint from bottom section to view     NSLayoutConstraint bottomConstraint  [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemsection2 attributeNSLayoutAttributeBottom relatedByNSLayoutRelationEqual toItemself.view attributeNSLayoutAttributeBottom multiplier1.0 constant0]     [self.view addConstraintbottomConstraint] codepre  pWhen all three are visible, everything is fine. However, when I hide one, one or more of the elements on the screen is vertically stretched so that the content size now matches the size 1000px size of the parent view as it is drawn in Interface Builder. At least thats what I think is going on. I would instead expect the parent view to shrink to the size of the content.p  pExample sections 300px each 1 and 2 are showing with a 50px gap and section 3 is hidden. That means that the size of the content is 650px. I would expect AutoLayout to shrink the parent view to 650px. Instead, the view stays at the size drawn in Interface Builder which is 1000px and then AutoLayout stretches the sizes of the content sections to reach the 1000px. If I resize the view in Interface Builder that new size will be the rendered size. Regardless of the amount of sections showing.p  pI feel like Im missing something simple but Ive spent hours trying to figure this out. Any ideasp  pstrongEditstrongp  pSome clarifications. There are no height constraints on any of the sections because they can vary in height depending on the amount of data. I just used 300px each to simplify things. And Im able to hide the sections instead of setting a zero height because in Interface Builder their are no constraints linking the sections. Those constraints are added through code at runtime because at runtime I know what needs to be linked to what. In the end. There is a solid link of vertical constraints from the top of the parent view to the bottom of the parent view. And none of the hidden sections contain vertical constraints.p  pstrongEdit 2strong If I defined a constraint for the height of the parent view, obviously I can modify the constant and manually set the size of view. Is there anyway to find the minimum size of a view based on dynamic content sizes and constraints p

Negative 2833 pWe have a .NET exe .NET 3.5, VS 2010 SP1, VB.NET project that is COM visible. A VB6 application uses CreateObject to create an object from this assembly.br This works without any problem if we do not sign the assembly. If we sign the assembly with a pfxcertificate, CreateObject fails with the message p  blockquote   pCant create Object Our.ClassNamep blockquote  pUnfortunately, there is no entry in the event log. The .NET exe can be started without any problem so all dependencies should be in place. Weve also enabled .NET binding logging, but it does not write anything when CreateObject is called so we suspect that the creation fails before the assembly is loaded.  br Weve tracked down all changes, the only difference that matters is whether the assembly is signed or not. Also weve tried different certificates, but the behavior doesnt change. brbr Has anyone experienced this behavior before and can provide a solution Are there any ways that can give us more information about the failurep

Negative 2833 pI have 1015 different types of results to calculate say AResult, BResult etc. All result calculation return single type of valueconsider an codeintegercode value. To calculate these I needs input parameters which are mostly common but a few needs different ones as follows p  precodeInput parameters example     AResult needs  int x, int y, int a[], int b[]     BResult needs  int x, int y, int a[], boolean c     CResult needs  int x, int y, int a[], boolean c, boolean d     DResult needs  int x, int y, int p[], boolean e     ..... codepre  pstrongNOTEstrong that in some cases result of one calculation is also used in other result calculations, but that is only in few cases and not all.p  pThe way I am doing it is through emApproach1em as follows p  pstrongApproach 1strongp  pI am defining an interface which has single method to calculate result taking an codeInputParameter objcode. In the implementation classes I would extract out the values from codeInputParameter objcode whichever are applicable to that particular type of result. Here is the snippet of my sample codep  precodepublic interface Result      int calculateInputParameter obj   public class AResult implements Result      public int calculateInputParameter obj        code          public class BResult implements Result      public int calculateInputParameter obj        code           public class InputParameter      int x     int y     int z     int a[]     int b[]     int p[]     boolean c     boolean d     boolean e     ....      Getters and Setters  codepre  pAs an example, say I create an codeInputParametercode object and set values of all the fields in there. I pass this object to aResultObject.calculateInputParameter obj , dResultObject.calculateInputParameter obj and so on.p  pcodeAResultcode needs  codeint x, int y, int a[], int b[]code   which I extract from codeInputParameter objcode do the calulations and return result.p  pcodeDResultcode needs  codeint x, int y, int p[], boolean ecode   which I extract from same codeInputParameter objcode to do the calulations and return result.p  pstrongNotestrong that I might have to do other sets of result calculations, so may create multiple objects of codeInputParametercode, codeAResultcode, codeBResultcode so on. Just want to convey that codeInputParametercode need not be singleton.p  hr  pstrongApproach2strongp  pHaving codecalculatecode method without any parameter and setting these values in individual Result class constructors.p  pAs Duncan pointed out one drawback of emApproach1em is that, here I might miss setting the required fields in codeInputParametercode object for a given result calculation. And when I actually try to extract out the value from codeInputParametercode object in codecalculationInputParameter objcode method, I discover it is not set.p  precodepublic interface Result     int calculate   public class AResult implements Result     public AResultint x, int y, int a[], int b[]        set input params        public int calculate        calculate and return AResult      codepre  hr  pstrongApproach3strongp  pCreate Single class or may be just 23 classes for Result and then just have separate methods to calculate different results. p  pI am also considering this approach because in some cases result of one calculation is also used in other result calculations but that is only in few cases and not all.p  precodepublic class Result      various fields...     int calculateResultA...    int calculateResultB...    int calculateResultC...  codepre  pIs the above mentioned strongApproach1strong good for given situaltion or the other alternatives are betterp

Negative 2833 pCore image has a public API for interrogating it for a list of supported filters, and asking for the parameters used to control those filters.p  pIf you interrogate iOS 7.1, the list of filters returned includes a number of filters that are not shown in the current Core image Filter Reference.p  pSpecifically, Im looking at CIBumpDistortion and CIBumpDistortionLinear. The Core image Filter Reference lists those filters, but it only lists them as available in Mac OS.p  pOrdinarily, I would think that the extra filters would be considered private to the Core Image Framework, and therefore unavailable. However, as mentioned above, public methods like filterNamesInCategory and filterNamesInCategories are listing the filter names, the attributes and inputKeys are listed, and the filters mostly work when called. There are a few bugs, but thats tangential to the question.p  pI posted this question to the Apple developer boards hoping somebody from Apple would give a definitive answer, but nobody has replied yet.

Negative 2833 pTake the following code fragment.p  precodeshort int a, b  30001, c  30002, d  30003 a  b  c  d codepre  pAssume that short int is 16 bits and int is 32 bits. Is this undefined behaviour in Cp  pMy reading of the C standard is that b and c must both be promoted to int, so the entire calculation must be performed using int arithmetic. The final value fits in a short, so UB does not occur.p  pI cannot find corresponding language in the C standard. The section on integer promotion n3797 S4.51 saysp  blockquote   pA prvalue of an integer type other than bool, char16t, char32t, or wchart whose integer conversion   rank 4.13 is less than the rank of int strongcan bestrong converted to a prvalue of type int if int can represent all the values of the source type otherwise, the source prvalue strongcan bestrong converted to a prvalue of type unsigned int.p blockquote  pThe emphasis is mine. strongCan bestrong is not the same as strongmust bestrong.p  pS 510 saysp  blockquote   pMany binary operators that expect operands of arithmetic or enumeration type cause conversions and yield result types in a similar way. The purpose is to yield a common type, which is also the type of the result. This pattern is called the usual arithmetic conversions, which are defined as followsp      p...p      p Otherwise, the integral promotions 4.5 shall be performed on both operands. Then the following   rules shall be applied to the promoted operandsp      p If both operands have the same type, no further conversion is needed.p blockquote  pIf the values are not promoted then the consequence is that the intermediate value of the calculation exceeds the range for short int, which means that the answer should be yes, this is UB.p  pIt also means there is an unlikely difference between C and C. It is not mentioned in the Compatibility section.p  pAll the other questions I could find involved mixtures of types, signedunsigned, etc. Nothing specifically on this question.

The temperature distribution, that satisfies the prescribed boundary and initial conditions, is given on page 50, I believe.p  pWhat I would like to do is find the time at which the onedimensional object equilibrates with the environment, which is held at a constant temperature of T0. As far as I know, the easiest way to do this would be to use the Taylor expansion of the exponential function, using only the first few terms, because I expect the equilibrium time to be relatively short and then use the small angle approximation for the sine function, because the rod has a relatively small length. Doing just this, I made a for loop to generate terms just as the summation function wouldas you can see, I used 1000 terms.p  pDoes what I am doing seem wrong to anyone If there is a better method, could someone please recommend itp

Negative 2833 pI would like to use both Telerik WPF UI Controls and WPF own controls in the same project. I think WPF is quite good and I need only a few controls and themes from Telerik. However, when I mix them, not all WPF controls benefit from the themes of Telerik. I read that, Telerik only support a few of WPF controls like TextBox and etc. However, I could not find a way to achieve a WPF Window with a looking like RadWindow. I have been searching and found some answers about this topic, but I think they are a little bit disorganized. p  pIn brief, I would like to use styles from Telerik for also other WPF Controls nonTelerik ones, but I am not sure whether it is possible or not When I use WPF Window and RADProgressBar together, of course it does not look very good. If mixing is not a good idea I am considering completely switching to WPF. I do not have much experience with Telerik and I do not want to struggle in a mess due to this mixed environment. I want to use both if it is possible to achieve a unified style for both controls Telerik and nonTelerik.p

Negative 2833 pI am trying to load a worldkind of.. into webglfrom an external file which has information of vertex position and face positions but the problem is the file containing the data is very large..about 100mb. In my approach I am using the file as buffer and have a single buffer in the init buffer which is overwritten again and again. What I am doing is, I am reading the values for an object from the file and drawing it on the canvas, then overwriting the buffer with the data of other object in my scene and adding it to the scene. In short I am not saving the vertex and face information. While animating I am reading the entire file again and redrawing. Its working fine with a file size of 20mb. but for file of large size I am not able to use high frame rate while animating. Which is not looking good.p  pstrongMy question is should I put all the vertex information into buffer and then draw the graphics and forget about the fileor my approach can be optimized Also if you can suggest any other method then it would be really helpfulstrongp  precode    try      var fileInput  document.getElementByIdfileInput     var file  fileInput.files[0]      read from filename     var reader  new FileReader     reader.onload  function e            var count0         var lastline0         var i         var j         var text  reader.result         var lines  text.splitrn            whilelastlineltlines.length                      var vertices  []             var VertexIndices  []             var vertexNormals[]             Position of the objects             for i  lastline i lt lines.length i                  if lines[i]  MESHFACEPOSITIONLIST                       break                                            for j  i  1 j lt lines.length j                  if lines[j]                        break                                  else                      var currentvertices  lines[j].split                       for var k  0 k lt currentvertices.length k                           VertexIndices.pushparseIntcurrentvertices[k]Check for ,                                                                 noOfVerticesForTriangles  VertexIndices.length              for i  j i lt lines.length i                  if lines[i]  MODELPOSITIONLIST                       break                                            for j  i  1 j lt lines.length j                  if lines[j]                        break                                  else                      var currentvertices  lines[j].split                       for var k  0 k lt currentvertices.length k                           vertices.pushparseFloatcurrentvertices[k]Check for ,                                                                   noOfVertices  vertices.length  3              lastlinej     this is where i am calling the function to draw the graphics after reading the data for an object         initBuffersvertices,VertexIndices         drawScene                      reader.readAsTextfile   catch e   codepre  pp  pCode for init bufferp  precode    function initBuffersvertices,VertexIndices  vertexPositionBuffer  gl.createBuffer gl.bindBuffergl.ARRAYBUFFER, vertexPositionBuffer gl.bufferDatagl.ARRAYBUFFER, new Float32Arrayvertices, gl.STATICDRAW vertexPositionBuffer.itemSize  3 vertexPositionBuffer.numItems  noOfVertices  vertexIndexBuffer  gl.createBuffer gl.bindBuffergl.ELEMENTARRAYBUFFER, vertexIndexBuffer     gl.bufferDatagl.ELEMENTARRAYBUFFER, new Uint16ArrayVertexIndices, gl.STATICDRAW vertexIndexBuffer.itemSize  1 vertexIndexBuffer.numItems  noOfVerticesForTriangles codepre  pp

Negative 2833 pHow can I prevent unauthorized access to a static singlepage ExtJS app in a Django powered websitep  pMy approach was to look for ways to do it from the Django side but I failed to see a way to get Django to serve a static folder with a ExtJS singlepage app built with Sencha Cmd basically a index.html  allclasses.js  resources folder with assets just for authenticated users.p  pIt would be perfect if there were any configs in Apachemodwsgi that could somehow read the headers of a request and be able to decide if the user is authenticated or not. The code provided in the docs the suggested a hrefhttpscode.google.compmodwsgiwikiAccessControlMechanisms relnofollowauthentication script for Djangoa apparently does the trick but in an inelegant manner, prompting for username and password. The user will be already authenticated against Django so it is nonsense to perform another authentication.p  pAny ideas on how to achieve thisp  pNote Ive seen other questions such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2687957djangoservingmediabehindcustomurlthis onea that addresses serving static files to authenticated users, but they seem impractical for my scenario I would have to create a view to parse the supposedly static url and map every dirfile to their filesystem equivalent. I dont know, it didnt seem promising to me but of course I could be overlooking that solution.p

Negative 2833 pHow can I build a transit network in igraph so it would take into account the lines and the number of transfers between them  Id like to be able to define lines. So, for instance, if I calculate the shortest paths between two vertices stations Id like to know the number of transfers between lines needed in that path.pp  pFor example, lets assume 3 metro lines, and I calculate the shortest path between A and E, I obtain A, E and D, which is correct. However Id like to know somehow that despite being the shortest path, a transfer from line 2 to line 3 is needed in the node E, whereas the path A, B, C, D is direct. How can I define those lines in igraph and know when transfer between lines happenp  pLine 1 A, B, C, Dbr Line 2 A, Ebr Line 3 E, Dbrp  precodem  lt  rbindcA, B,          cB, C,          cC, D,          cA, E,          cE, D g lt graph.data.framem, directedFALSE sp lt get.shortest.pathsg, fromA, toD  Vg[spvpath[[1]]]  Result in the console  Vertex sequence [1] A E D codepre

Negative 2833 pIve written a simple web sevice where an handheld device connects to a Twisted script on a server. The device sends data to the script, the script uses this data to query a MySQL db, the db content is sent back to the device. The script is based on the script written in this tutorialp  pa hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com3932networkingtutorialforioshowtocreateasocketbasediphoneappandserver relnofollowhttpwww.raywenderlich.com3932networkingtutorialforioshowtocreateasocketbasediphoneappandserverap  phow would a script like this handle a large amount of connections in my head, its only limited by the server, the higher the server memory the higher the amount of connections you can handle. But will the script perform well with large amounts of connections For every connectiong a new instance of the connection is made, and a new instance of the db is made for that connection when there is a query, so its all handled asynchronously i believe, so is the only performance limit the servers cpu power and memory coping with high connection volumes is done by expanding your servers for my service, a connection may remain open from anywhere between 1  3 hours, so its possible that the server memory will fill and crash the server.p  palso, does anybody know what the size of a connection instance would bep  pprobably more of a servers question than a Twisted question but Thanks very much for readingp

Negative 2833 pI am running into out of memory issues after a certain amount of time when I run my quickfixj app. After a little investigation I found out that this was being caused by messages that quickfixj caches for re sending when a resend request is received.p  pSo for testing I set this flag to N on a particular session. After that my memory problems completely disappeared. But I do not understand why quickfixj is keeping these message in memory when I have properly set this property  FileStorePath. These messages should be stored into a file but they are not. I do see some files present in the directory I set in FileStorePath but none of them seems to be storing messages, I can only see sequence number in them. Do I need to set other flags besides this in order to make this workp  pI do not plan to use PersisMessages flag outside testing. I would prefer FileStoreMaxCachedMsgs flag with a reasonable figure. I also need to know what will happen if my app receives a resend request when I have set PersisMessages to N Will quickfixj send gapfills instead or will it crash with some exception messagep  pThanksp

Negative 2833 pSo first of all, Im completely knew to Behavior Trees and AI. That being said, I could be thinking about this all wrong.p  pSo Im attempting to create a Behavior Tree. My BT has a Tick function that will create a Tick object, passing in the target actor, the blackboard, and the BT instance to the Tick object  p  precodeTick tick  new Ticktarget, blackboard, this codepre  pIt then goes on to call an Execute function on the root node to begin the behaviors.p  precoderoot.Executetick codepre  pEverything is running fine... with just one BT. My issue now is, when I create a root BT, then attempt to create two other BTs and make them subtrees maybe one that checks for opponents and attacks, and another that runs away, I dont have a way to hook them up.p  pHow does one go about plugging in a subtree into a node Subtrees allow for data that is only associated with that subtree.p  pAm I think about this all wrong Do I just need one BT, and the term subtree is really just for the user interface aspect of thingsp  pI mean, when it comes down to attaching sub trees, I can really just take BT2s root and make it BT1s child, but then all nodes in BT2 will become part of BT1... their Tick functions will be passed a blackboard and this object from BT1, not BT2.p  pI hope all of this made sense Hopefully someone can help.p  pThanks all.

Negative 2833 pIn the image below, whilst I was getting to grips with Git I made the following commits. Essentially I made a dev branch pink, made some commits to it, switched back to my master branch blue and made some more commits before merging my dev branch into master.p  pWhat Id like to do now is rebranch dev so I can work on a new feature. Git isnt allowing me to make a new branch dev as it has previously existed. Im aware I could make a new foo branch but Id like to keep the total number of branches down if I can.

Ive just uploaded this to my site a hrefhttpkach.olympe.inllsifrare.php relnofollowhttpkach.olympe.inllsifrare.phpabr The layout is very simple, the CSS as well, but it doesnt show up. And its only on this page. The homepage and another have exactly the same code skeleton I basically copypasted and changed the content, but the CSS doesnt work.

Even when I change codeltlink hrefcss.css relstylesheet typetextcss gtcode to the full path, the CSS still doesnt work and I seriously cant figure out why. Is there anything Im doing wrongp

Negative 2833 pIs there any reason to use the local security permissions and set up sharing for specific usersgroups when youre also using roles out of AD Our company has multiple security groups in AD and Id like to be able to just use those to control access to the web site. But this legacy site has sharing set up in the local security so that only some groups have access to the physical directory but then it uses other groups and roles to determine access to specific parts of the site.p  pCant this all be done using roles in AD or is it done this way as an added security level  A related question, is AD the default role manager if one isnt specifically set up The site uses isInRole several times to check against security groups in AD and I cant find anywhere in the site or IIS where it tells it to use AD. I know its using AD because I can create a new group in AD and have the code determine if a user is in it or not. p  pThanks, let me know if you need more info.p

Negative 2833 pI have a folder no subfolders full of thousands of files of differing formats pdf,xls,jpeg, etc. The files dont have a common naming structure, with the only pattern relating them being that somewhere within the file name there are the letters PN immediately followed by a 6 digit number.

Negative 2833 pT.C. left an interesting comment to my answer on this questionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma272610181128289Why arent include guards in c the defaultap  pT.C. statesp  blockquote   pTheres header and theres source file. headers dont need to be   actual files.p blockquote  pWhat does this meanp  pPerusing the standard, I see plenty of references to both header files and headers. However, regarding codeincludecode, I noticed that the standard seems to make reference to headers and source strongfilesstrong. C11,  16.2p  precodeA preprocessing directive of the form      include lt hcharsequencegt newline searches a sequence of implementationdefined places for a header identified uniquely by the specified sequence between the lt and gt delimiters, and causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the header. How the places are specified or the header identified is implementationdefined. codepre  pandp  precodeA preprocessing directive of the form      include  qcharsequence newline causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the source file identified by the specified sequence between the  delimiters. The named source file is searched for in an implementationdefined manner. codepre  pI dont know if this is significant. It could be that headers in a C context unambiguously means header files but the word sources would be ambiguous so headers is a shorthand but sources is not. Or it could be that a C compiler is allowed leeway for bracket includes and only needs to act as if textual replacement takes place.p  pSo when are header files not filesp  pemThe footnote mentioned by T.C. in the comments below is quite directemp  blockquote   p174 A header is not necessarily a source file, nor are the sequences   delimited by lt and  in header names necessarily valid source file   names 16.2.p blockquote
Negative 2833 pIm about to create a application with the use of a database, where multiple users are allowed to edit information about an entity.p  ptldr How to lock a row in a database while a user is editing its information in C.p  pI have done some research on Locking a record in a database while a query is executing. What I mostly see is locking with codebegin transactioncode and codecommit transactioncode. However this does not suit my needs because it needs to be locked longer then the time the query is executing.p  pIf user1 is editing a record in c, with a form application, filling out some textboxes, then I need that row to be locked until he is finished with editing. Because at the same time user2 might try to edit the same record. By the time user1 is done, everything is fine, but when user2 finishes, he ether overwrites or gets errors back about the record name he was searching for does not exist anymore.p  pA simple solution would be to add a column with codeIsLockedcode, depending on that a user can edit a row. But when for some reason the application crashes or the user force stops the process in task manager, the row would be locked forever. or is there still a way to execute code while this happendsp  pAnother method would be to execute a query without codecommit transactioncode. For that, I believe, you have to keep the connection open, otherwise it will terminated. Keeping an open connection doesnt seem to be a good idea to me while running an application, or is itp  pside note title says mysql because Im not quite sure which one I will be using.p  pThx for your timep

Negative 2833 pThis oughta be fun for you who enjoy a good puzzle.p  pMy enterprise iOS app transmits .jpg images to the server in Base64 format using GCDAsyncSocket on a TCP connection. With about one out of 10 transmissions the first 962 characters are cut off.p  pWhy 962p  pIm looking for a clue so I can maybe head it off before it sends. As it is I have a routine in the server that will check if the first few characters  which are consistently the same  are there, and if not it will send back a request to the client app to resend the data. When that happens, its usually a complete record.p  pIm thinking it might be a TCP infrastructure thing. Once it gets passed to the socket, its out of my control.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 2833 pI am thinking about a race condition in a production system I am working on. Database is PostgreSQL. Application is written in Java, but this is not relevant.p  pThere is a table called versions, which contains columns entityID and version and some other fields. This table contains versions of a certain entity.p  pThere is an application where user can modify those entities.p  pEvery modification of an entity creates a new version to the tabel versions using a trigger. This trigger finds the last version in the same table versions and inserts a new row with the same entityID, but version  last version  1.p  pThere is a nightly job that is run in PostgreSQL every 400 that also changes those entities and therefore updates data in the table versions. This procedure was designed to finish its work by the morning before users of the application start to use it, but unfortunately runs into the day. As this procedure is run in a function, then it is one big transaction. Therefore the changes done by it are not visible to the application.p  pThe nightly job uses the following strongworkflowstrongp  ul liSet failedcounter  0li liIterate over entities that need to be modifiedli liDo modifications to the entity inside a BEGIN .. EXCEPTION .. END blockli liIf there is an EXCEPTION, increase the failedcounter. Log the exception and the failed entity to a log table.li liIf failedcounter  10, cancel work.li liEnd workli ul  pThis has caused the following strongrace conditionstrong to happen a few times lets assume that X is the last version of entity A p  ol liNightly job startsli liNightly job modifies entity A, creating version X1li liApplication is used to also modify entity A, creating also version X1 because the nightly job transaction has not COMMITed, so the version X1 is not visible to the applicationli liNightly job ends, causing COMMITli liThere are now two versions with version number X1, which causes application to break.li ol  pI thought that I could just solve the problem by using an UNIQUE CONSTRAINT over fields entityID, version. I thought that it would cause the application to receive an error due to violating the UNIQUE CONSTRAINT at race condition step 3. But I am not sure how does the unique constraint work in this situation. In race condition step 3, when the application adds a version, does the database check the UNIQUE CONSTRAINT I suppose not, since the transaction of the nightly process has not been completed. If I am correct and the UNIQUE CONSTRAINT is checked only at race condition step 4, when COMMIT is made, then this causes the whole nightly procedure to fail, which is not desired result.p  pSo, the question is the following. p  ul liWhen is the UNIQUE CONSTRAINT checked At race condition step 3 or race condition step 4 li liIf the answer to the last question is race condition 4, then how could I change the design of the system to avoid the abovementioned problems li ul

The following configuration requirements are necessary to successfully check for existence of the application services database and automatically create the application services databasep  pIf the application is running on either Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008R2, special configuration steps are necessary to enable automatic creation of the provider database. Additional information is available at a hrefhttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId160102 relnofollowhttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId160102a. If the applications AppData directory does not already exist, the web server account must have read and write access to the applications directory. This is necessary because the web server account will automatically create the AppData directory if it does not already exist. If the applications AppData directory already exists, the web server account only requires read and write access to the applications AppData directory. This is necessary because the web server account will attempt to verify that the Sql Server Express database already exists within the applications AppData directory. Revoking read access on the AppData directory from the web server account will prevent the provider from correctly determining if the Sql Server Express database already exists. This will cause an error when the provider attempts to create a duplicate of an already existing database. Write access is required because the web server accounts credentials are used when creating the new database. Sql Server Express must be installed on the machine. The process identity for the web server account must have a local user profile. See the readme document for details on how to create a local user profile for both machine and domain accounts.p  pDoes anyone have any idea as to why thanks for repliesp

During the running period of above code, soapUI logs the details to soapui.log as mentioned in soapuilog4j.xml. Once that statement is done, it is closing that file appender and further logs are throwing the above error. p  pWhat I am suspecting is that, as log4j configuration is global for entire project, our logger is getting initialized with the log4j.properties file given in classpath. But,SoapUI is overriding those properties with its own configuration from soapuilog4j.xml  in that way it is keeping file appender for root logger and closing it once it is done with building WsdlProject and hence the above error was thrown.p  pIf I comment the above code wsdlproject building code, every log is working fine.p  pIs there any hidden problem in this Also is there a way so get rid of this problemp  pPS I have only one log4j.properties in classpath.

One thing for sure is SoapUI is configuring its logger from the overridden soapuilog4j.xml.p

However, I dont know how to do this is a simple way, my approach is the followingp  precodeint r  c.getRed int b  c.getBlue int g  c.getGreen declare all bins as arrays  if 0  lt r lt63      if 0lt g lt 63          if 0lt b lt 63              bin1 push.c         if 64 ltb lt126             bin2 push.c         if 127 ltb lt 190             bin3 push.c                  if 191 ltb lt 255             bin4  push.c              if 64 ltg lt126         if 0lt b lt 63              bin5 push.c         if 64 ltb lt126             bin6 push.c         if 127 ltb lt 190             bin7 push.c                  if 191 ltb lt 255             bin8  push.c              if 127 ltg lt190         if 0lt b lt 63              bin9 push.c         if 64 ltb lt126             bin10 push.c         if 127 ltb lt 190             bin11 push.c                  if 191 ltb lt 255             bin12  push.c              if 190 ltg lt255         if 0lt b lt 63              bin13 push.c         if 64 ltb lt126             bin14 push.c         if 127 ltb lt 190             bin15 push.c                  if 191 ltb lt 255             bin16  push.c                 ...       codepre  pThis process is tedious and not really efficient.

Negative 2833 pI am writing an input routine that requests a number between 1 and 30 from the user, and which is meant to emit an error message and reprompt the user for input until valid input is received. I used a loop to read the input and check it against various cases, exiting the loop once appropriate input is received.p  pThe case checking against whether the number is in range works or did work perfectly fine, but when I check to make sure that the user did not enter anything nonnumeric, the whole thing pretty much blows up in my face, and the loop seems to act weirdly. I was told at first it was an issue with not closing the input buffer so I added that fix, but then despite the condition being met the first time, it would not jump back to the front of the loop to allow the input to be altered  instead it would immediately jump to a branch and continually print that message on the order or thousands of times per second.p  pBelow is the code. The part that gets continually printed is the codeif isalphauNum ...code.

Negative 2833 pSo Ive been trying to statically link the libcurl library to my project for the past DAY and Im literally pulling my hair out. Everywhere on the internet different instructions are given and none seem to work. Ive never statically liked a library before but now I have to for the sake of keeping things organized.p  pSo my project is a .dll file, which requires the libcurl library to function. Ive managed to build a libcurl.lib file from the libcurl source, but I have no idea what I need to do with the properties of my dll project. Ive tried adding it to Additional library directories, Additional include directories, Additional dependencies all without success. Some configurations seem to work, but in the end it still doesnt link statically, only dynamically. Oh, and Im using Visual Studio 2013.p  pDoes anyone have any experience statically linking libcurl Any help would be much appreciated. Thanksp

I need to enable codemodrewritecode, so that I can properly configure the code.HTACCESScode file.p  pI searched online, and found many references to this codehttpd.confcode,  but nothing remotely resembling my situationp  pI contacted the socalled Customer Support service on my Domain Registrar.

Any input greatly appreciatedp  precodeimport pygame import random  pygame.init  winwidth  800 winheight  600 window  pygame.display.setmodewinwidth,winheight  pygame.display.setcaptionRoger Dodger  black  0,0,0 white  255,255,255 red  255,0,0 orange  255,127,0 yellow  255,255,0 blue  0,0,255   clock  pygame.time.Clock  class Collisions     def initself, x1,y1,w1,h1,x2,y2,w2,h2         self.x1  x1         self.y1  y1         self.w1  w1         self.h1  h1         self.x2  x2         self.y2  y2         self.w2  w2         self.h2  h2      def checkColself         if self.x2  self.w2 gt self.x1 gt self.x2 and self.y2  self.h2 gt self.y1 gt self.y2              return True          elif self.x2  self.w2 gt self.x1  self.w1 gt self.x2 and self.y2  self.h2 gt self.y1 gt self.y2              return True          elif self.x2  self.w2 gt self.x1 gt self.x2 and self.y2  self.h2 gt self.y1  self.h1 gt self.y2              return True          elif self.x2  self.w2 gt self.x1  self.w1 gt self.x2 and self.y2  self.h2 gt self.y1  self.h1 gt self.y2              return True          else              return False      def yelcolself         if Collisions.checkColself             return True      def oracolself         if Collisions.checkColself             return True   class Sprite      def initself,x,y,width,height, color          self.x  x          self.y  y          self.width  width          self.height  height          self.color  color      def renderself,               pygame.draw.rectwindow,self.color,self.x,self.y,self.width,self.height    Sprite1Spritewinwidth2 ,winheight60,30,30, blue   moveX  0  sprite2x  random.randrange30, winwidth, 30 sprite3x  random.randrange30, winwidth, 30  fallingpos  0   gameLoopTrue while gameLoop      for event in pygame.event.get          if event.typepygame.QUIT              gameLoopFalse          if event.typepygame.KEYDOWN              if event.keypygame.KLEFT                  moveX  3              if event.keypygame.KRIGHT                  moveX  3         window.fillwhite      ground  pygame.draw.rectwindow, black, 0, winheight30, winwidth, 30      Sprite1.xmoveX      fallingpos  3      Sprite2Spritesprite2x,fallingpos,30,30, orange     Sprite3Spritesprite3x, fallingpos, 30, 30, yellow      collisions1CollisionsSprite1.x,Sprite1.y,Sprite1.width,Sprite1.height,Sprite2.x,Sprite2.y,Sprite2.width,Sprite2.height     collisions2CollisionsSprite1.x,Sprite1.y,Sprite1.width,Sprite1.height,Sprite3.x,Sprite3.y,Sprite3.width,Sprite3.height       Sprite1.render     Sprite2.render     Sprite3.render      if collisions2.checkCol and collisions2.yelcol        if Sprite1.width and Sprite1.height gt 30            Sprite1.width  5            Sprite1.height  5            Sprite1.y  5      if collisions1.checkCol and collisions1.oracol        if Sprite1.width and Sprite1.height lt 300            Sprite1.width  5            Sprite1.height  5            Sprite1.y  5      if Sprite1.x lt 0         Sprite1.x  winwidth      elif Sprite1.x gt winwidth         Sprite1.x  0        if fallingpos gt winheight         fallingpos  0      pygame.display.flip      clock.tick120  pygame.quit codepre

Negative 2833 pI have developed a windows service using C.Net which collects data and send to my server using custom APIs on a regular interval basis with the client users permission.p  pIt was working fine until the user installed the antivirus software Kaspersky.

As so it is working fine for now.p  pBut as for final solution, I want to know can we fix this within program itself programmatically. So that any antivirus software do not detect it as trojan or any other kind of virus as soon as my program and its service get installed.p  pstrongEdit  8th, June 2015strongp  pEarlier forgotten to mention that within service .exe it downloads its own latest .exe file to update itself.

I confess that Im no yet 100 sure on how to deal with q, but Im starting to use and test, but when it comes to dealing with a method inside of a http request, that needs the information from another different http request, things gets really confusing and messy.  Basically what I was trying to do with this method is get a response whether is false or true, and based on that change a ngclass.

I would like to work with local storage and mysql but im stuck with problems because of missing knowledge of mine. I googled a lot but because everything is on english its really hard for me to learn things.p  pWhat i want is, that on the first app start on the phone after download the application generates an random unique username or numeric value and saves it on the local storage as variable. Also it should save a variable called vip to the local storage and set it to 0. And it needs to check if the variables are already set, then the application need nothing to do.p  pThese to Variables should be send to an mysql table, lets call it user.p  pExample User Tablep  precode  username vip             A7w893579       0 codepre  pSo the variables are saved on the local storage and in the mysql database. After the user makes an payment over the payment provider the variable vip needed to set to 1 and fetch it to the right username and saves the 1 into the vip row for the user on the user table.p  pAnd i need any way to do a function like If the vip status is 1 show in a iframe vip.html on a site. If its 0 show novip.html on the site.p  pHave you any ideas how i can do that I read something about Ajax Calls but i dont understand it right. If somebody have a few code snippets i would be very thank full. I dont need full code i just need to read it and try to understand.p  pThank youp

Negative 2833 pI am new to iOS development. I have a UITableView say TableA which is a subview of another UITableView say TableB. I am using auto layout to position TableA in TableB. Now, this works fine on iOS8 but the auto layout breaks completely on iOS7 giving some NSInternalInconsistencyException. To get rid of that exception is to stop using AutoLayout.p  pI went with this problem to an experienced iOS developer and that person told me that I shouldt be adding a subview to a UITableView since it is a private view. That is just plain wrong he said. Now I dont exactly get why is that wrong but I couldnt ask him further. I want to understand why is it wrong.p

Negative 2833 pI know LDPRELOAD is ignored under setuid conditions, but I thought that was handled by the linker before it reads the ELF.

However, I need the setuid to be granted for all processes, so I figured I could setuid on the codemyprogcode replacement wrapper program.  This wrapper sets LDPRELOAD to libefence.so.0.0, before calling execv and executing the equivalent of codereadlink procselfexe.efencecodep  pIs this security measure implemented far more simplistically, in terms of, if the linker detects an effective userid set at all, it will ignore LDPRELOADp  pUnfortunately, I dont have access to the build process for codemyprogcode, so I cant just simply link it against libefence.so.0.0.p
Negative 2833 pI have a flash browser application that loads in a child swf using a Loader object. p  pThe child swf has a mouseclick listener that calls nativateToUrl, and opens a new web page. It also contains mouse hover events that make things in the swf move around. p  pThis application that does the loading is like a container for the child swf and should open a emdifferentem web page when it is clicked. So essentially I want to suppress the child swf mouseEvent and listen for the mouse click on the container swf, opening the new URL. p  pI have heard of other people putting an invisible sprite over the original content so that the child swf doesnt actually catch a mouseclick event. However, this wont work in my case because then it doesnt get the mouse hover events either. I want the mousehover events to go through and make the things in the child swf move but also suppress the click event. p  pSo, for all the flash masterminds out there... is this possible And how can I do it p  p thanks. p

Negative 2833 pI am converting Bash shell installer utility to Python 2.7 and need to implement complex CLI so I am able to parse tens of parameters potentially up to 150. These are names of Puppet class variables in addition to a dozen of generic deployment options, which where available in shell version. p  pHowever after I have started to add more variables I faced are several challenges 1. I need to group parameters into separate dictionaries so deployment options are separated from Puppet variables. If they are thrown into the same bucket, then I will have to write some logic to sort them, potentially renaming parameters and then dictionary merges will not be trivial. 2. There might be variables with the same name but belonging to different Puppet class, so I thought subcommands would allow me to filter what goes where and avoiding name collisions. p  pAt the momment I have implemented parameter parsing via simply adding multiple parsersp  precodeparser  argparse.ArgumentParserdescriptiondeployment parameters. envselect  parser.addargumentgroupNone, Environment selection envselect.addargumentc, clientid,  helpClient name to use. envselect.addargumente, environment, helpEnvironment name to use. setuptype  parser.addargumentgroupNone, What kind of setup should be done setuptype.addargumenti, install, choicesANSWERS, metavar, actionStoreBool, helpYyNn Do normal install and configuration  MORE setup options ... args, unk  parser.parseknownargs config[deploycfg].updateargs.dict  pupclass1parser  argparse.ArgumentParserdescriptionNone pupclass1  pupclass1parser.addargumentgroupNone, Puppet variables pupclass1.addargumentaddomain, helpADLDAP domain name. pupclass1.addargumentadhost, helpADLDAP server name.

I will need to return something like codeIEnumerableltCustomerGroupgtcode where codeCustomerGroupcode is completely different with codeCustomercode, but it is not an actual table because I dont need it in the database.p  pSo my question is, is it okay to make a new Entity model p  precodepublic class CustomerGroup      public int GroupName  get set      public decimal Percentage  get set   codepre  pbut the different is that its not registered in the Database Context codeDbSetcode so my service can return this typep

Negative 2833 pA byte consists of 8 bits on most systems.p  pA byte typically represents the smallest data type a programmer may use.

Yet using less than a byte is not supported by any programming language I know of natively.p  pWhy does this minimum of using 8 bits to store data exist Why do we even need bytes Why dont computers just use increments of bits 1 or more bits rather than increments of bytes multiples of 8 bitsp  pJust in case anyone asks Im not worried about it.

Negative 2833 pI am writing some code for a client and server using c.p  pI am using boost serialize to serialize an object on the client side and then send it to a server. The server then unserializes the stream and recreates the object. The server then calls the run function of the object. The server then serializes the object and sends it back to the client.p  pThe reason I am doing the above is for instance the client needs to know what files are in the homedataIncoming folder on the server.p  pThis is just one simple examplep  pMy question is that it seems that for the objects that are serialized I need the same code on the server AND the client.  Or how would the server know how to unserialize the object sent.p  pThus if I change the server code i need to make sure I also get the code over to the client program.p  ol lipHow do programmers easily solve this problem of duplicate code on the client and the server pli lipOr is there some way I could serialize so this duplicate code did not need to exist on the client and the serverpli lipor do i simply send a protocol stream over to the server and have the server read in that protocol stream to reconstruct commands to be run and info to be sent back.pli ol  pIt seems easiest to just construct an object on the client side, have it run on the server, then sent it back to the client with results.p  pThanks for all your ideasp
