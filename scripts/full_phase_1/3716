Positive 3716 pI am writing a serial port communication application in Java using a library called jSSC javasimpleserialconnector with an external device.p  pAfter sending a message and waiting for its return, I have a timeout that will abort the reading if there is no reading after certain time 2 second. If that happens, the port is closed and reopened for further message exchange.p  pWhat I noticed is that, if for some reason, the timeout happens, and the port is closed and reopened, further message reading from the port will be interfered i.e., the message read cannot be decoded. It looks as if previous message from the device is still on the line and continue to come in for the next reading operation. p  pIm not very familiar with serial port so Im not totally sure if this is the case. I would think but may well be wrong the previous message sending by the other part is discarded after I close the connection from my side as in a TCPIP communication. p  pCan anyone shed some light on this topic as to how exactly the serial port behave after closereopen Is it possible for the other part a device to continue sending the old message even after I close the connection in the applicationp
Positive 3716 pI have two Arduinos now used by my program. SInce Im on Linux and new to Linux, the port isnt static, like com3 and com6, I think its ttyUSB0 for the first Arduino which is connected, and ttyUSB1 for the second and so on. But since both are connected when the OS boots, can I be certain that the port names will remain the same Or is there some other way to access ports by namep

Positive 3716 pFollowup question to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32702885permanentusbportnameslinuxpermanent USB port names Linuxap  pOn Windows the port names dont change between actual physical ports. They are along the lines of COM3, COM6, etc. On Linux, if I plug one USB device first , it will be ttyUSB0 and if I plug the same device second in any other physical port it will be ttyUSB1. That wont work if I want to, say, have 2 Arduinos connected via Pyserial to the PC.p  pIn the above answer I was shown a way to get an IPlike serial name. How can I feed that to the PySerial class insteadp

This has worked perfectly but now I need to talk to eight different serial ports simultaneously and threading has become a must.p  pI cant tell exactly where the error is coming from, but whenever I attempt to connect to a serial port from either a separate Thread or BackgroundWorker, it is unable to open the port  Open returns false. Strangely enough, the port seems to opening and will remain open ... if I attempt to open the port again from a knownworking program, it will report that the port is already open. However, inside of my program, the port is definitely not open. Open returns false and if I attempt to write to the port, I get the port not open exception.p  pIf I use Open from the main thread and dispose of it properly, it opens and closes exactly as expected. Can this wrapper be used in a separate thread, or do I need to approach this differentlyp  pEDIT I dug around a bit and found that in ConfigureSerialPort, the linep  precodeif GetCommStatehandle, ref serialConfig codepre  pis evaluating false, so the method returns false and the serial port cannot be configured.

Note I am using codeaioreadcode and codeaiowritecode to read and write to the device.p  pIf the device is left powered on, then codeclosecode succeeds as expected.p  pExamplep  precode Open the com port  int fd  open gcomName, ORDWR  ONOCTTY  OASYNC    Ensure fd is valid, do some work, then power off the Bluetooth device    Wait until all aysnc io is complete  while aiocancelfd, NULL  AIONOTCANCELED    Application will hang here  closefd codepre  pWhat am I doing wrong My guess is the OS is waiting for confirmation from the device, but never gets anything. Is there anyway to force close the connectionp

Positive 3716 pI need to control mouse pointer and keyboard input for 5 keys on desktop Linux using a device controlled by microcontoller. The microcontoller is connected to my desktop through serial port. The microcontroller can send values of mouse pointer movementx, y, clicks and pressed keys through serial port to the desktop.

Positive 3716 pI have the following problem. I am using WS2811 diodes, Arduino Due and node.js to my project. I want to stream video from a device connected to a node.js server and show it on array of diodes. Right now I am able to capture video from any device with browser and camera, change resolution of the video to this desired by me 15x10 and create String chain containing informations of all colors R,G,B of all diodes. I am sending it from node.js server to arduino though serial port with baud rate 115200. Unfortunately sending process it is too slow. I would like it to refresh the LED array at least 10 times per second. So I was wondering maybe to compress this string which I am sending to arduino, when it gets there decompress it, and set colors to diodes. Maybe you guys have some experience with similar project and advice me what to do.p  pFor handling diodes I am using adafruitneopixel library.p  pThanks in advance p

Rerouting example.com8080 to localhost80 does work and if I access example.com it loads up the frontpage of my local version, but all links on that page of course dont know about the port number and therefore point to the production version...

Negative 3716 pIm curious to know what are the performance impacts of using HTTP Basic Auth on a webserver like Apache or lighttpd or nginx. I imagine the bottleneck is the actual reading of the file by the server to authenticate a user. It also seems to me that the cost of reading the file to authenticate a user is proportional to the number of users in that file.p  pQuestions i have arebr  1. is there a specific number of users at which basic auth via file starts to fall dramatically or is it linearly relative to the number of users in the filebr  2. Given the stateless nature of http, if a user has been authenticated using HTTP Basic Auth by the webserver on one requestbr   does it simply forward the credentials on every request and the webserver must parse the password file everytime in order to determine if this is a request from a valid userbr  orbr   get something like a token that it uses in the http header on subsequent requests, allowing the server to avoid parsing the password file again p  pthanks in advancep

So I am now trying to go from the alert to a blank canvas, then back to the alert. Of course I dont want the user to interact with the previous canvas, so it seems that I am forced to create a new blank canvas. As a sidenote, this has the slight disadvantage of looking worse on phones which still have the previous screen when an alert is shown.p  pThe bigger problem is how to transition from the blank canvas back to an alert once the canvas is loaded. Testing on the Motorola emulator revealed that showNotify is not called after returning from an alert to the previous screen. I guess I could create the next alert in the paint method, but this seems like a ugly hack.p

Negative 3716 pI would like to know the best method of breaking up large Java Swing classes.  Some of mine are quite large and I would like to begin the process of properly modularizing my code.  I saw that I could add my classes to Netbeans palette but the problem is they are not showing me a graphical representation of what it will look like when I drop them into the GUI designer.  Some third party jar files support getting added to the palette and they provide a graphical preview of what theyll look like once run.p  pMy question is, I dont know the proper terminology for what this preview is called so Im finding it very difficult to search for.  I would like some documentation or a tutorial on how to make my current classes able to be added to the palette and see what it is they will look like in the GUI designer.p  pThank youp
Negative 3716 pMy initial approach to this was to use a stored procedure in database of Application A, triggered on an insert to gather additional data and call a webservice, hosted by Application B to do the necessary mapping and persistence there. Application A and Application B may not be on the same machine. The initial requirement is to support a SQL Server database on Application As side. A CLR stored procedure came to mind. However, it was felt that calling out to a webservice would have both severe performance implications in the SQL Server engine and also require elevation of permissions for the procedure that DBAs do not like to give.p  pI am now thinking in terms of the procedure creating some form of reference table on database A and a polling application consuming this data and cleaning up once processed at Application B. However, I cannot but think that there is a better way of doing this beside polling for the data.p  pApplication A is Windows only. Application B could be Windows, UNIX, or LINUX, so Java would be the obvious choice on this side.p

How can this be done Is this an API and whats the best way to do it Im using PHPp  pIf Im not explaining the problem clearly, please ask me if theres something thats not clear.p

Negative 3716 pIm confused regarding which scope should i use. p  pHere i have a module, that consist of 4 level of pages like page browse  page header  page detail of that header  page sub detail of that detail. Im thinking that each page would have its own managedbeans. p  pThe deepest level, level 4 the sub detail page, would be able to access every other managedbeans state in the outer level. The level 3 the detail page could access level 2 managedbeans state header page and level 1 managedbeans state browse. p  pThe outer managedbeans wont be able to access the deeper managedbeans statep  pUsing request scope will not do, since the deep level pages need to access other state in outer levels.p  pUsing session scope will do, but will memory consuming when the user switch to other unrelated program modules, and those unused beans will stay in the memory as long as the session. And moreover, i cant open these chains of pages in different tabs.p  pUsing conversation scope is confusing for me also, since i dont have a clear begin and end like a wizard style pages, or quiz pages. The user could switch back n forth with these pages and do actions in any page.p  pUsing view scope seems possible, but i must use the parameter passing from one page to another. The deeper level beans wont be able to access the outer beans, but they could receive the string parameters from the previous page. This kinda ugly, because i might need to query many information from the database again that could have been done in the previous managed bean.p  pAm i thinking wrong p  pPlease share your thoughts.p  pThank you,br Albert Kamp

Negative 3716 pIm working on an iPhone app using objective C.  Ive got class A, which creates an NSMutableArray pointer called list.  But, in class A, I never create an object for it to point to.  Instead, I call a class method in class B, to get some data from an sqlite database, and populate an NSMutableArray object there.

Negative 3716 pIm fairly new to Guice so hopefully this isnt an obvious question...p  pIm dealing with a framework which dynamically instantiates one of my application classes  lets call it codeCcode using reflection, so I have no control over its instantiation.

Here codeDependencycode is clearly a singleton but this neednt be the case generally.p  pI have come up with two possible solutions, neither of which feels very tidy, so I thought Id ask the expertsp  ol lipStatic injection.  I struggle to see how this improves drastically over the service locator antipattern though  I end up with non final static fields which could be manipulated externally... hmmm.pli lipThe framework supports a hook for codeCcode to initialize itself post instantiation the codeinitializecode method shown above.  This method could selfinject the newly created instance using setter injection.pli ol  pWith 2, I guess this means more external alterability but at least exposes the dependency a little more explicitly for things like unit tests.  Trouble is how do I get my hands on the Guice Injector in that case short of relying on yet another service locator  Ive also read and tend to agree with that explicitly referring to the Injector throughout app code is dubious practice.p  pYour insight would be really appreciated.p  pMany thanks,br Christianp

Negative 3716 pI am currently working on an OpenGL application to display a few 3D spheres to the user, which they can rotate, move around, etc.  That being said, theres not much in the way of complexity here, so the application runs at quite a high framerate 500 FPS.p  pObviously, this is overkill  even 120 would be more then enough, but my issue is that running the application at fullstat eats away my CPU, causing excess heat, power consumption, etc.  What I want to do is be able to let the user set an FPS cap so that the CPU isnt being overly used when it doesnt need to be.p  pIm working with freeglut and C, and have already set up the animationsevent handling to use timers using the codeglutTimerFunccode.  The codeglutTimerFunccode, however, only allows an integer amount of milliseconds to be set  so if I want 120 FPS, the closest I can get is codeint1000120  8 mscode resolution, which equates to 125 FPS I know its a neglegible amount, but I still just want to put in an FPS limit and get exactly that FPS if I know the system can render faster.p  pFurthermore, using codeglutTimerFunccode to limit the FPS never works consistently.  Lets say I cap my application to 100 FPS, it usually never goes higher then 9095 FPS.  Again, Ive tried to work out the time difference between renderingcalculations, but then it always overshoots the limit by 510 FPS timer resolution possibly.p  pI suppose the best comparison here would be a game e.g. Half Life 2  you set your FPS cap, and it always hits that exact amount.  I know I could measure the time deltas before and after I render each frame and then loop until I need to draw the next one, but this doesnt solve my 100 CPU usage issue, nor does it solve the timing resolution issue.p  pIs there any way I can implement an effective, crossplatform, variable frame rate limitercap in my application  Or, in another way, is there any crossplatform and open source library that implements high resolution timers and sleep functionsp  pEdit I would prefer to find a solution that doesnt rely on the end user enabling VSync, as I am going to let them specify the FPS cap.p  pstrongEdit 2 To all who recommend SDLstrong which strongI did end up porting my application to SDLstrong, is there any difference between using the codeglutTimerFunccode function to trigger a draw, or using codeSDLDelaycode to wait between draws  The documentation for each does mention the same caveats, but I wasnt sure if one was more or less efficient then the other.p  pEdit 3  Basically, Im trying to figure out if there is a simple way to implement an accurate FPS limiter in my application again, like Half Life 2.  If this is not possible, I will most likely switch to SDL makes more sense to me to use a delay function rather then use codeglutTimerFunccode to call back the rendering function every codexcode milliseconds.p

Negative 3716 pThis is an interview questionagain. p  blockquote   pGiven a singly connected linked list, find the largest palindrome   in the list. You may assume the length of the palindrome is evenp blockquote  pThe first approach I made was using a stack  we traverse over the list from the start and keep pushing in the letters. Whenever we find the letter on the top of the stack is same as the next letter on the linked list, start poppingand incrementing the linked list pointer and set a count on the number of letters that matches. After we find a mismatch, push back all the letters that you popped from the stack, and continue your pushing and popping operations. The worst case complexity of this method would be On2 e.g. when the linked list is just a string of the same letters.  p  pTo improve on the space and time complexityby some constant factors, I proposed copying the linked list to an array and finding the largest sized palindrome in  the array which again takes On2 time complexity and On space complexity. p  pAny better approach to help me with  p

Negative 3716 pOkay so Ive noticed that even though I use the correct path for the cache folder Android doesnt register the content in the folder so the user cant delete the cache content by going into settings  programs  administrate  select program  clear cache. The folder is deleted properly on uninstal but not if the user actively try to clear the cache. This is not a major issue but its still a minor problem because the user dont get a proper idea of how much space the application uses at the SD card. Is there anything I as developer can do to update these values or am I doing something wrong somewhere elsep

Negative 3716 pThis is a strange which Im hoping someone can shed some light on.  We are in the process of moving from Weblogic 8.1 to 10.3.4 and as part of this we are updating various things including our deployment descriptors.  In our webapp our web.xml was Servlet verion 2.3 with the following codeltDOCTYPE webapp PUBLIC Sun Microsystems, Inc.DTD Web Application 2.3EN httpjava.sun.comdtdwebapp23.dtdgtcode  p  pWe have now changed it to 2.5 as follows codeltwebapp xmlnshttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaee  xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaeewebapp25.xsd version2.5gtcodep  pSince the change we have come across some jsps that fail to compile at runtime. They fail because we havent imported some necessary classes for that jsp. For example in one we are using a Calendar java.util but for whatever reason failed to write the import declaration for it. For some reason in 2.3 this didnt seem to matter. Does anyone know if this was a feature of 2.3 that certain classes were imported on the fly when the import was not declared. I fully appreciate they should be imported properly but I fear we may have a few other jsps which will fail.p

The client B could request to A to start sending him info from each service like a stream service until the client B says to A to stop the services.p  pThese services could only send one character with 100ms interval or 1000characters with 100ms interval or even send some data when its needed.p  pWhen the info sended to B, arrives it has to know what service corresponds, what action and the values example, so im using json over jabber.p  pMy problem is that im wasting a lot of bandwith with jabber xmpp protocol just to send a message with a body likep  psx, x5 each 100ms 5 represents any numberp  pI really dont want to have parallel communication like direct sockets, because jabber has all of that implemented and its easy scalable, firewall problems, sometimes i use http communications im using BOSH in this case.p  pI know that there is some compression that i can do, but im wondering if you recommends something else that could not have such ammount of xml behind my message and still, using jabber.p  pThanks a lot for your help.p  pBest Regards,p  pEduardop

Negative 3716 pI was reading a book on Java Servlets where I came across codeHTTPSessionActivationListenercode. It was specified that in a clustered environment , there can be only one HTTPSession object containing a specific session id. Assume there are 2 nodes A and B in a cluster p  pfirst request goes to node A. Here a HTTPSession S1 is created along with session attributes and response goes back to the client. Same client sends the subsequent request. This request goes to node B. Now the session object S1 is moved from node A to node B activated in Node B and passivated in node A.p  pIn this case should the session object along with the attributes be serializable What happens if it is not serializablep  pIn order to count the number of active sessions , should the sessions in both nodes be added up to get the actual value How is this usually donep  pAlso I guess ServletContext is unique for each JVM. Are the attributes set as part of servletcontext copied to servlet context in all nodes of the clusterp

Negative 3716 pI am using WMD like stackoverflow uses. I have read the upvoted posts on the topic which all advise to store both the markdown and the htmlpurified versions on the server. The reason for this is the markdown is needed for the user to edit his post, and the to purify on the fly is too expensive for the server so better to convert it and store it on the server.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5193221240324httpstackoverflow.coma5193221240324ap  pHowever, when I show on the index page a bit of every question, then I dont want the markdown or the html version. I would like to call striptags on every question excerpt. But would this be heavy for the server to do it on the fly Should I store a third field for a stripped tagged versionp

Negative 3716 pI have been spending some time reading different best practices for databases and for SQLite specifically. While reading I found I was doing many things I shouldnt be doing and when attempting to fix these issues I became confused when thinking about some of the finer details of using SQLite with its ADO implementation.p  pMy confusion stems specifically from prepared statements and connection pooling. p  pWhile reading a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms971481.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms971481.aspxa I found that connections should only be opened for a transaction. Once the transaction is complete then the connection should be closed. I do not have a firm grasp as to why this is the case, but I have been working off the assumption that the authors know better then I. I understand that when a connection is closed it doesnt mean it has actually been closed. It simply means that it has been put back into the pool.p  pNow to improve my queries and inserts I read about using prepared statements. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1703203insqlitedopreparedstatementsreallyimproveperformanceIn SQLite, do prepared statements really improve performancea and a hrefhttppetesbloggerama.blogspot.com200702sqliteadonetpreparedstatements.htmlhttppetesbloggerama.blogspot.com200702sqliteadonetpreparedstatements.htmla both seemed to indicate that when executing a query that will be done multiple times prepared statements are the way to go. I have also read that a prepared statement is specific to a connection and that once the connection is closed the prepared statement is lost.p  pMy confusion is this. If I am opening and closing my connection which may or may not mean the connection is being closed due to the thread pool then how much use am I really getting from a prepared statement I can understand that if I have 1000 objects I need to save in a single transaction that the prepared statement can help a lot. However I dont believe I would see a benefit from saving a single object in a transaction because once I close the connection the prepared statement that was generated from the first object is now lost. Is this a true statementp  pMy confusion is furthered by the fact that I believe a prepared statement is linked to the scope of my SQLiteCommand object.p  pIf I create a SQLiteCommand that represents a query that I will be executing often do I need to keep that SQLiteCommand in memory for the prepared statement to stay activep  pIf I create a new SQLiteCommand with the same SQLite statement is it recognized that the new SQLiteCommand is the same as the previous and thus has a prepared statement that can be usedp  pIf I keep a SQLiteCommand in memory and change its parameters and connection as I open and close the connection for different transactions am I essentially keeping a prepared statement alive between different connectionsp  pI am most likely over thinking things at this point but I hope you can help me better understand how these things interact so I can get the most benefit out of them.p

I can see the file getting created and then it disappears  darndest thing.p  pIm so irritated with the thing Im tempted write a perl script or maybe some compiled vba with regexp to check the very few fields that are not character fields.  Its a small thing, but its extra  and Im worried about the next guy maintaining it.  I dont think any of the other guys program in perl or are familiar with the regexp in .net  Besides, the msdn documentation makes it SEEM like the bulk insert should report the problem row in that error file.p  pAny ideas  Is this a known problem  Is there some parameter Im missing  Is there another way around this Or is an external data format checker the right way to gop
Negative 3716 pI am working on an Android app and a method I am writing might get called a bunch of times. In this method I am making updates to the user interface. Memory use and performance are important to me. The way I see it, I have 2 options for making the UI changes. p  pThe first is to makes new objects every time. That is to say something likep  precodepublic void myMethod new View.makeVisible  codepre  pThe second is to declare the object as a variable globally and reference it in the method. This might look likep  precodeView myView  new View  public void myMethod myView.makeVisible  codepre  pObviously the if this method only called a few times any difference is going to be small. However if I am potentially calling this many times, and there are many variables being callor created this way, does the second way increase performancep

Negative 3716 pThis is probably a very basic question about AD FS 2.0 claim rule design that I havent found an answer to newbie. Im probably missing something very basic, but here goes. p  pIm deploying a federation within a company. The company users will be able to browse to a web application A, B, C etc. Each app will have their own subdomain URL, e.g. appa.company.org, appb.company.org, etc. When the application redirects to its trusted STS landing page I want the return URL to be passed to the STS. In the STS claim rules I want to extract that return URL and perform a database lookup, e.g. for the current user and the application with URL appa.company.org I want all roles that the user has in that application e.g. admin, superuser, purchaser, whatever.p  pMy questions are p  ol liHow do I pass along the return URL to the STSli liHow do I write the claim rule I know how to make the database lookup and issue the results, but I dont know how to retrieve the return URL or any other custom parameter for that matter in a claim rule.li ol  pCheers,p  pLinusp
Negative 3716 pI have what is hopefully a very easy question, I just cant find the answer online. I made a merge sort function  which im sure has inefficiencies, but im here to ask about the threads. Im using Windows CreateThread function to spawn threads to sort intervals of a given array. Once all the threads are finished, I will merge the segments together for the final result. I havent implemented the final merge yet because im getting strange errors which im sure is from a dumb mistake in the threads. Ill post my code, if you could kindly look at paraMSort. Ill post the whole MergeSort.h file so you can see the helper functions as well. Sometimes the code will compile and run perfectly. Sometimes the console will abruptly close with no errorsexceptions. There shouldnt be mutex issues because im doing operations on different segments of the array Different memory locations altogether. Does anyone see something wrong Thanks so much.p  pPS. Are Windows CreateThreads kernel level In other words, if I make 2 threads on a dual core computer, may they run simultaneously on separate cores Im thinking yes, since on this computer I can do the same work in 12 the time with 2 threads with another test example.p  pPPS.

Negative 3716 pI have a project where I need to connect an Android App to an ERP that uses WCF, IIS Internet Information Services, Active Directory and Role Based Scurity.p  pThere are thus a lot of security options allready included by default like basicHttpBinding which allows the use of certificates and HTTPS and so on.p  pThe one thing I havent decided yet is what data encryption Ill use to secure the data when it travels from the app to the ERP. I have read that there is a Java AES library that can be used, then again I also read that somebody could also decrypt the packages if he or she intercepts them.p  pI was wondering two things p  ul lipIs there a Best Practice concerning data encryption on mobile apps, since the computing power is not as strong as a computers and the message cant be too heavy or long to decrypt since this would slow down the app which we do not want of course.pli lipI was actually thinking about using some kind of PGP public key where the public key is in the Android Devices and the private Key is in the ERP but maybe this is not a smart or even a very secure way to do itpli ul  pThen again.. since Ill be using TLS, maybe I dont need to encrypt my Data and its secure enough p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 3716 pin a browser such as google chrome , when I want to get information of the page , I just select view page source but in some sites that use javascript you cant do that , so I discovered that on any element such as a button and select inspect element it will show me the information that I need , and its really great but I want to do this automatically  for example for simple pages that use html , I just use wget to save the page to text to analyze it later , but for pages that use javascript and css its impossibile , so my question is there a tool or any way to get the information I need and save it to text lets say I specify the site and the element button  and it will download the code and will save it to textp

Negative 3716 pI have a project in which I need to split very large PDF files containing between 150 and 200 thousand pages each. I am currently using the iTextSharp DLL to split some of the PDFs which have the standard bookmarks that can be created by Adobe Reader. I am also using PDFsharp to extract text from the PDFs that dont have these standard bookmarks, whereupon I parse them for keywords from a database and split them into smaller PDFs. As opposed to the first method, however, this is strongextremelystrong slow. p  hr  pThe PDFs that dont have the standard bookmarks do, however, have indexesbookmarks.  The problem is that these are created by SOLindexera hrefhttpwww.solimarsystems.comSOLindexerOverview.php relnofollowLink to product pagea. I was able to find these indexesbookmarks in the internal COS tree. The path within the internal structure of the PDF to the place I want to get to is trailerInfoSSEDictionaryDocumentMemberStatements.  Within this directory if it could be called that I am able to click on DATA and open a notepad file which contains all of the account numbers, names, things I need of course the format is weird, but readable, and I believe that these are the values that I could put in a dictionary. p  hr  pIn iTextSharp and PDFsharp youre able to access the Info section by doing, for example, codevar stuff  reader.Info.Valuescode or perhaps codevar stuff  reader.Info.Keyscode, but those seemed to be dead ends as I could not do anything to get the SSEDictionary contents from there. iTextSharp also allows you to look at the trailer, and I was able to get the keys from there, but past that I could not drill down to the lowest level. I am aware that there is a way to get things from the internals using PDFsharp like so p  precodePdfSharp.Pdf.PdfDocument inputDocument  PdfSharp.Pdf.IO.PdfReader.OpenMapPathPDFsMember Statements062012.pdf, PdfDocumentOpenMode.ReadOnly PdfSharp.Pdf.PdfDictionary dictionary  PdfSharp.Pdf.PdfDictionaryinputDocument.Internals.Catalog.Elements.GetObjectOutlines  codepre  hr  pHowever, I have not been able to figure out how to adapt this to my current situation and the path to the stuff I need.Moreover, I am not quite sure how exactly to do this in iTextSharp my favorite of the two libraries. Thus, my question would be how exactly would you get a dictionary which I believe all of the stuff in the text file I opened up is in code Also, what would that code look like I have a decent understanding of the internal structure of the PDF, but I just dont quite know how to get there. Thanksp

When this happens, the succession between the changes that happened in my labels and textarea were not shown. The code works fine if i called it directly in my tester class but calling it inside the actionperformed method shows only the final state of my GUI.

Negative 3716 pI have a site where u can print a sheet via TCPDF containing various information. Most of this information are tables for which i found it quite easy to write a pagebreak myself. I could not use the AutoPageBreak method with these aswell because the HTMLCell seems to start in my header in case of an automatic pagebreak I generate the Yvalue dynamically through getY. So i wrote a simple pagebreak and it works just fine with an iteration of HTMLCells. The problem is now i need to have a pagebreak for just one HTMLCell that is displaying messages such as EMails that are saved on the site. so i need to kind of split the HTMLCell into 2 in case of a pagebreak or have it not to ignore my header.p  pI have searched for this quite a lot and didnt seem to find an answer. Ive seen a post by Nicola Asuni where he wrote that it would work with transactions but i dont quite see how that should work or Im just to stupid.p  pthanks in advancep

Negative 3716 pI launched Eclipse earlier to jot down a snippet, and was faced with this as an error when I tried to run this fresh project An internal error occurred during Compute launch button tooltip.  That popup window shows as soon as I mouseover the run icon in the top bar, or if I right click on the class in the explorer window and select any of the rundebug options.p  pAfter doing some research on the error I see several people who posted messages similar but they all have been fresh installs of eclipse. So note that this is not a fresh install, and that Eclipse was working fine earlier today. Also note that not only does my new project not run with the normal main method, but projects I was running earlier have all stopped working with the same error.p  pFinally also be aware that after seeing other peoples suggestions on fixing this, one specifically said to select run configurations from the top of the page run menu, when I selected run configurations from this dropdown I got the following messagep  pException occurred creating launch configuration tabsbr Reason Plugin org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui was unable to load class org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.launcher.LocalJavaApplicationTabGroupp  pAfter that message, the run window opens but all of the tabs are missing.

However, when I do my calculations in between and then try to codefreecode the arrays, I get an access violation exception c00000005. When I was debugging it, I noticed that the program would execute perfectly every time if I had a breakpoint within the freearray loop and did every line individually. However, the compiled code wouldnt ever run past row6 of my second array on its own. I turned off all optimisations in the compiler, and I still got the error upon execution.p  h1Additional infoh1  precodetypedef struct      int    height     int    width     int    bottomposition of the bottom tubeslice boundary     unsigned int  datptra pointer to a 2d array      arrayinfo codepre  pWhere the codedatptrcode is now a proper 2D pointer.

I thought that it would evaluate both conditions in that order or stop if either was FALSE, independent of their order. However, it turned out it didnt work that way and it was simply refusing to evaluate the codeiltarraygtwidthcode part correctly. Also, I assumed that it would trigger an exception upon trying to access memory outside of the array range, but it didnt. Anyway,p  pI changed the code top  precodevoid fillnumberarrayinfo array,  int value,  int x1,  int y1,                                                     int x2,  int y2      int i, j     ify1gtarraygtheight y1arraygtheight1     ify2gtarraygtheight y1arraygtheight1     ifx1gtarraygtwidth  x2arraygtwidth1     ifx2gtarraygtwidth  x2arraygtwidth1     foriy1  ilty2  istart seeding the values by row              forjx1  jltx2  jseed the values by column                  arraygtdatptr[i][j]value                codepre  pAnd now it works. The block of codeifcodes is there because I wont be calling the function very often compared to the rest of the code and I need a visual way to remind me that the check is there.p  pAgain, thank you so much Jonathan Leffler, Chris Dodd, and rharrison33 p

Negative 3716 pIn a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comlibrarybb878133 relnofollowthisa rather old article, the author statesp  pPort Blockingp  pPort blocking allows an application to prevent other applications from performing specific binds to the ports within a specified range. When blocking a port range, the application must choose a contiguous range of port numbers that are between the value of the MaxUserPort setting 5000 by default  1 and either 49151 for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 with no service packs installed or 65535 for Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1. There should be no existing bindings to the ports within the range of blocked ports. Windows Sockets returns the last port number in the blocked range as the handle. When unblocking removing the block, Windows Sockets unblocks the range that has the same left edge as the unblock request.p  pThe implication I get from reading this is that there is some api an application can use to setunset this, but I have drawn complete blanks trying to search documentation for any such thing, nor do I recall ever seeing such functionality in my socket programming days.p  pIs there such a capability in Windows, and if so, pointers to documentation of it will be heartily appreciatedp

These can be code.slncode for .NET or code.projectcode for Eclipse.p  pI want to ask why is this practice widely applied or considered a good practice, considering that I agree that achieving IDEneutrality dont bind developers to a specific IDE is a good principle, in general.p  pOn the contrary, these control files often dictate project dependencies, configuration or compilation variables in multiple configurations this is the case of the code.csprojcode files for example.p  pI have seen a large number of open source projects ignoring Eclipse files, however it has been impossible to me so far to set up a development environment without the project files even if I create a project from existing code, or create a new project and import the code, I always get plenties of compilation errors.p  pIf the project files were present in repositories it would be vry simple to set up a development environment with download the code, import the project and voil compile the source but it would obviously bind developer to a specific IDE and thats not funny.p  pStandardizing or migrating project files is out of the scope of the question.p  pSo, from an external contributors point of view, how does one build up a working and compiling project environment for a project of which he downloaded the source code from Github after cloning all submodules, if neededp  pJust to pick strongonestrong example project I would like to import into Eclipse, analyse and slightly modify, a hrefhttpsgithub.commitreidconnectOpenIDConnectJavaSpringServer relnofollowherea it is.p

Negative 3716 pIm attempting for the first time to build up a token using dependency injection. I have a diamond hierarchy problem, where I need to prepend a signed hash of my data to the actual data itself. p  pAs a result, I find myself calling get on the original data provider multiple times. This would be fine, but further down the graph, there are timebased components and as a result, the data returned on subsequent calls is different.p  pA solution was suggested to use the Singleton Provider model. For this Provider, subsequent calls to get return the same object reference. This Provider caches the result of the first call to get and continually returns that. When injecting dependencies, I inject the same instance of this provider twice, and as a result it returns the same data twice.p  pThis got me thinking, is there any situation where you wouldnt want to use a Singleton Provider If you expect a different result, shouldnt a new Provider instance be created every timep  precodepublic MyUnderscoreStringSingletonProvider implements ProviderltStringgt      private final ProviderltStringgt mySomeOtherStringProvider     private String myCachedString      public MyUnderscoreStringSingletonProvider          ProviderltStringgt someOtherStringProvider               mySomeOtherStringProvider  someOtherStringProvider         myCachedString  null           Override     public String get              if myCachedString  null                       myCachedString  create                  return myCachedString           private String create              return   mySomeOtherStringProvider.get         ...  public class SomeCoolService       ...      public ProviderltStringgt injectStringDoubler              final ProviderltStringgt stringProvider               injectUnderScoreStringProvider         return new TwoConcatendatedStringsProvider             stringProvider,             stringProvider           This would not work if Singleton Provider was not used.

Negative 3716 pcan you give me a hint to this problem I have a vector of int sorted ascending and the distance between two elements is v[i1]  v[i]. For example v[]0 , 5, 7 ,8, 10, distance between 5 and 0 is 5, 7 and 5 is 2 etc.I want to remove NB values NB is number of values that i want to remove of this vector i cant remove 0 or 10 so NB could be maximum 3 so that the distance between two elements would be maximum. For this example the minimum distance is between 7 and 8...if i want to remove only one element NB1 I would remove 8, than the minimum distance would be 2 distance between 5 and 7. p  pI made a structure smth like this 0,5, diff 5 5,7 diff 2 7,8 diff 1 8,10 diff 2 then i sorted this ascending by diff and as long as NB is not 0 i would remove the second element from the pair if its not 10 or 0, find the next pair which has that element, replace it with the first element from the pair when i first found that element,and then update diff...In this example i will remove 8 and the result would be 5,7 diff 2 7,10 diff 3 0,5, diff 5. I think this is very inefficient because i have to search again the element. Can u give me an idea of how to make this efficientp

Negative 3716 pIve got some 15yearold code that does MAPP MasterCard Automated Point of sale Program credit card transactions over a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPlainoldtelephoneservice relnofollowPOTSa and a modem, with Host Data Capture as opposed to Terminal Data Capture.  It implements  get approval opcode 08, post approval 60, sell 10, refund 30, and void 50 transactions.  As I recall, MAPP also allowed fetching the data for a given retrieval number or perhaps whole batches.  For validation purposes I need to implement one or the other fetch a transaction or batch.  Fetching the card and amount for a given retrieval number would be sufficient.  However, I can no longer find our copy of 60M08V3.01096 Pointofsale Specifications and Certification Procedures, and that document doesnt appear to be anywhere on the web.

Negative 3716 pI have various scenarios in loops where I would peek or skip ahead while iterating through items for processing.   p  pOne scenario is Im enumerating through lines of a file, and there is a continuation character at the end of a line indicating to combine the next line with the current line.

I effectively want to consume the next lines without exiting my closure.  But Im not even sure if that is possible.

So I created a new map in Tiled and imported a new Tile set and picked the CLIFFVEG which can be found in the downloaded tiles.p  pFinally my questionsp  ol lipThe tiles does not seem to be transparent. This means when drawing some grass and then putting some mountainscliffs the grass wont shine true as a background. The blue background on the cliff images takes precedence and shows upon the grass. Can I turn the GIF tiles transparent in some waypli lipWhen finished my map in Tiled. How do I implement it in my Mono game Ive seen some frameworks mentioned in the a hrefhttpsgithub.combjorntiledwikiSupportforTMXmaps relnofollowdocumentationa.

I am looking for design patterns or advice in terms of what to make an object, and what to make an attribute of another object.p  pFor example, suppose Im interested in the characters in the novel, and which chapters and pages they appear on.p  pThe concept Im struggling with is how to organize an object system with two types of containers that both participate in relationships with the same instances.

I see a few approachesp  ul lipMake everything Novel, Chapter, Page, Character an object, and each of these objects has lists of references to other objects they contain  relate topli lipGive primacy to one or the other of Chapter or Page, and make the other an attribute of the first.  For example we could go with just a Novel, Chapter, and Character object list, and make pages an attribute of the Chapter object.pli lipWe could take the above idea even further and just stick with Novel and Character, and give each Character a few attributes such as Occurs in Chapter and Occurs on Pagesp  pWell, I hope thats clear enough for some OO design gurus to suggest where to draw the line between Object or Attribute, and how to design an object system where there are different kinds of containers Chapter, Page that the objects of interest Character belong to.pli ul

Negative 3716 pThe tool Im working on can only send GET requests, and I need to process heavy operations using the information contained within the request. These operations then return a String containing a URL I will use for redirection.p  pAfter doing some researches, Ive found that doGet method is rather used for preprocessing a request, while doPost can be used for postprocessing. p  pIs there any way I can do these heavy operations using the doGet method  If I have to use the doPost method, how can I turn my request into a POST request  p  pThanks.p  pEdit  Ive already tried to process these heavy operations within the doGet method. But it seems the servlet doesnt wait until the url String I use for redirection is generated. Ive read its a bad thing to try to synchronize your doGet method performancewise.p  pEdit 2  About what Im trying to do  The tool Im working on is an Oracle solution. You can launch custom actions within the client, including web applications. Launching a custom action will send a GET request to the application, containing all the information about the page from which you launched the application user, item selected, etc and the application then uses this information to process the heavy operations I talked about. Operations consist of creating a new session on the Oracle client using the same IDs, making queries based on the item selected, creating XML Data and even using an external program located on the Oracle server. Finally, it returns a download URL from where you can download a PDF report, and I use this URL to redirect the application.p  pHeres the servlet code p  precodepackage com.servlets  import java.io.IOException import javax.naming.InitialContext import javax.servlet.ServletConfig import javax.servlet.ServletException import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse import com.actions.agileSessionHandler import com.actions.BOMComparisonReport  public class DefaultServlet extends HttpServlet       public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response  throws ServletException, IOException          agileSessionHandler handler  new agileSessionHandler...

While I can append  delete characters directly changing value, I see no option but input simulation for the keys like Up, Down, Home, and some others. p  pAccording to the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPIevent.initKeyEventredirectlocaleenUSampredirectslugDOM2Fevent.initKeyEvent relnofollowdocumentationa, it should be simple. For examplep  precodevar e  document.createEventKeyboardEvent if e.initKeyboardEvent    Chrome, IE     e.initKeyboardEventkeydown, true, true, document.defaultView, Enter, 0, , false,   else   FF     e.initKeyEventkeydown, true, true, document.defaultView, false, false, false, false, 13, 0  document.getElementByIdtext.dispatchEvente codepre  pindeed fires the Enter keydown event, and my handler can catch it. However, it does not affect the textarea in any way  a new line does not appear. Same for other keycodes characters do not appear, arrows do not change the carets location, etc.p  pI have extended the code by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers912236orwellophileOrwellophilea and posted it to a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netnpF3d4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netnpF3d4a , so anyone can play with the code.

Negative 3716 pIn the codeonCreateViewcode of my codeFragmentcode class I am creating and returning a codeViewcode whose contents need to be dynamically created based on the actual screen width and height of the codeFragmentcode.p  pIt would be most ideal if I were able to determine the width and height within codeonCreateViewcode. This is because when the codeViewcode is constructed within codeonCreateViewcode, many child codeViewcodes are added to it, and how the parent layout codeViewcode organises those children into columns depending on available width and height to create a kind of fluid column container. p  pI tried seeing what codeLayoutParamscode are contained in the codeViewGroupcode passed to codeonCreateViewcode but the width and height seem to be constants as opposed to specific widths and heights.p  pWould I be correct in believing that, at this stage in the layout phase within the codeFragmentcodes codeonCreateViewcode, there is no width and height available If that is the case, then what I suspect I need to do is build my container codeViewcode in two phases 1 add the children to it initially, and then 2 actually organise those child codeViewcodes into columns within an override of a method thats called at a point when the width and height are known.p

Ive found that sometimes an image from the stream will have a large spike in brightness every pixel jumps or drops in value, and then return to its normal brightness level in the next image.p  pThis is a huge problem for my algorithms. Is there anyway I can prevent this spike in brightness I was thinking of something like a low pass filter on each pixel, but I was wondering if anyone has more experience with this issue.p  pI will be designing in MATLAB and implementing in OpenCV.

Negative 3716 pIm trying to detect whether a string is XMLHTML formatted, or some other format like CSV or JSON, which may contain HTML as data, or just generic text which may contain random lt or  characters.  I am NOT trying to validate complete XML or HTML documentsthe strings I am testing may just be snippets of XMLHTML, or they may be snippets of something else.  So, my criteria are that the string must contain at least one properlyformatted XML tag, and that tag must start at the beginning of the string, barring any whitespace.  At this point, you may have guessed that I am trying to autodetect the mimetype of textual content before sending it back to the browser.  BTW, Im in PHP.p  pI have a regex that will detect the XMLHTML tagp  precodelt[az].gt.lt[az]gtgti codepre  pAnd I have a regex that will tell me if the tag starts the string, ignoring whitespacep  precodeslt codepre  pProblem is, I cannot figure out how to combine both of these into a single regex.

Negative 3716 pIm intending to write a HTML5Javascript game to run in modern browsers.  It will need dialog boxes i.e. modal popups whose borders would be made of images e.g. one for the vertical, one for the horizontal, one for each corner.  The popups, and therefore border, should contain and size to a div containing text or whatever.  There will be lots of different size popups.  So I can provide repeatable images from which the borders should be made, but I dont want to create an image for every size of popup that I need in my game.p  pI hope that my requirements are clear enough.  Can I do this with just CSS  Are there some sample CSS libraries to do this  Or do I need to use Javascript or a combination of CSS and Javascript and, again, if so there any example or libraries I can usep

Negative 3716 pIm having trouble making PUT and DELETE requests to my Laravelpowered API work on IIS7.p  pAnswers to other questions have said to allow the PUT and DELETE verbs to be mapped to the ExtensionlessUrlHandler handler. This doesnt work for me, possibly because the API is PHP, and that handler doesnt send the request to PHPp  pIve made it work by adding a new handler, mapping codecode to codeFastCgiHandlercode the same as code.phpcode is mapped to. This makes PUT and DELETE requests to the API work, but means that the server is using codephpcgi.execode to serve static content, meaning my stylesheets arent coming through correctly.p  pI cant add the handler mapping emjustem to the api folder, because routing is handled via Laravel so there emisntem an api folder to put the web.config file into.p  pRequest filtering is set to allow all verbs even unlisted ones, and I dont have WebDAV installed two other common solutions.p  pIt may be that I have the handler situation set up incorrectly to begin with Im not sure Im no expert on IIS.p  pAny insights will be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 3716 pWe have a social responsibility project aiming encourage young people to learn mobile application development. The main problem we face mostly is language. Most of the young people in our country dont have sufficient english knowledge to be able to search or learn something in english. Thats why our one of the biggest difference from the world wide tutoriallearning sites is being in native language. p  pAs a supporter of the project in the technical side, we answer questions, write blog posts and try to help people learn mobile application development in their native language. One of the problems i face with while helping people is the inability of providing official referencesin native language about the responses we gave. This problem pushed me thinking about translating whole android sdk documentation to our native language  I know its a huge job, we may try to crowdsourcing it i dont know but the thing i want to ask here is just suggestions about implementation of such a project.p  pWhat kind of technology would you use, how would it be possible to stay synch with the recent versions of the sdk. Do you think the current android sdk documentation pages autogenerated completely Is it just javadoc How to support multilanguages with javadoc Or with any other way p  pI hope questions will not be closed being unrelated, it is a completely technical question. p  pThanks everyonep

I also will have to provide them start and end date and upon selecting these dates the content placed in these nodes should be exportable in CSV format.p  pCan anybody guide me in how to achieve this functionality. I have gone through report generation but need better clarity on how this can be achieved like how will i be able to use QueryBuilder api how can i export and how do i provide the dates on the UI.p
Negative 3716 pI have a slight problem. The directions for the overarching problem are as followsp  ul lipThe game board has 31 cells.  The first one is labeled START, the last cell END, and the remaining cells are numbered 1 through 29.pli lipThere are three players, A, B, and C.  The game starts with all players on the START cell.  Player A always goes first, then B, then C, then A, and so on.  The game ends when a player reaches the END cell or beyond.pli lipEach move consists of rolling an 8sided die and moving that many cells forward.  However, if the die shows a 4, move backwards that many cells but dont go before START if the die shows a 6, the player doesnt move at all and forfeits the next turn.  If a player lands on a cell occupied by the other player, the player that was on the cell jumps immediately to START.pli ul  pInput  The rolls of the 8sided die for five games.  Each game consists of positive integers representing the rolls, terminated by a 0.  The first number is for player A, then B, then C, then A, and so on.  Each game ends as described above or when the 0 is read.p  pOutput  For each game, print the final position of the players A, B, and C.  The position of all three players must be correct to receive credit for each output there is no partial credit.p  pSo, before I start explaining the problem, I have 80 of the code complete. In no way am I looking for someone to do my work, Im just looking for someone that could possibly explain to me a strategy to use for the following part of the problem.p  pI have completed the code fully for the movement part of the lab, such as all the dice cases from 1 to 8 excluding 6. Now, my problem is that I do not quite know how to make the program skip a players turn AND next turn if the dice is rolled to be a 6. In other words, how do I fulfill the skip turn and forfeit next turn requirement The code I have so far only works for inputs without the number 6 is belowp  precodeimport java.util.Scanner  public class seniorLab     static String input     static double parsedInput     static int i  0     static int count  1     static int positionA     static int positionB     static int positionC     static int valueOfRoll     static boolean aAtEnd     static boolean bAtEnd     static boolean cAtEnd      public seniorLab           static void labLoop         for int i  0 i lt input.length i             if input.charAti  0                 if i  3  0                     valueOfRoll  charToNuminput.charAti                     positionA  valueOfRoll                     if positionA  positionB                         positionB  0                                           if positionA  positionC                         positionC  0                                           if positionA gt 31                         aAtEnd  true                         break                                       else if i  3  1                     valueOfRoll  charToNuminput.charAti                     positionB  valueOfRoll                     if positionB  positionA                         positionA  0                                           if positionB  positionC                         positionC  0                                          if positionB gt 31                         bAtEnd  true                         break                                        else if i  3  2                    valueOfRoll  charToNuminput.charAti                     positionC  valueOfRoll                     if positionC  positionA                          positionA  0                                          if positionC  positionB                         positionB  0                                          if positionC gt 31                         cAtEnd  true                         break                                                    else if input.charAti  0                 break                               System.out.printOutput   count             System.out.printA  positionA  , B  positionB  , C  positionC           static int charToNumchar ch         switch ch              case 1 return 1             case 2 return 2             case 3 return 3             case 4 return 4             case 5 return 5             case 7 return 7             case 8 return 8                  return 0           public static void mainString[] args         Scanner in  new ScannerSystem.in         System.out.printLine   count             input  in.nextLine         input  input.replaceAll[,],          seniorLab sL  new seniorLab         sL.labLoop       codepre  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 3716 pIm trying to use Highstock to draw 10 seconds of an ECG signal sampled at 250Hz, that is, 2500 points. The problem I have is due to data grouping approximation, and the fact that each value of the signal can vary widely from its neighbors in some cases, so any of the approximation functions provided by Highstock result in a very distorted signal after drawing, because the maximums and the minimums are lost in most cases. I created a jsFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netYaubF relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netYaubFa showing the effect. Just drag the signal to make groups being recalculated and look at the peaks of the beats.p  pOne solution to this problem is to use a range approximation function that represents each group with two points minimum and maximum, but i think there is currently no available option in Highstock to do this on spline series. Even if you provide your own approximation function, you have to return one single point as a result.p  pI think it should be possible to implement this by strongproviding my own approximation function which returns min and maxstrong, and strongmodifying codeseriesProto.groupDatacode function where the grouping and approximation are applied to properly manage this resultstrong. p  pLooking at the code I really dont know how to do that, so any help would be appreciatedp  pstrongEDITstrong p  pAs Pawel points out in the first answer, an arearange series could be an option to preserve minimuns and maximuns.

Negative 3716 pI am trying to write bindings for a C library, specifically the a hrefhttplibnfc.org relnofollowlibnfca. My current code is available on a hrefhttpgithub.comFUZxxlopenkey relnofollowGithuba.p  pOne of the central structures in the libnfc is the device. It is represented by the Go type codeDevicecode.p  precodetype Device struct      d C.nfcdevice   codepre  pAll functions inside the libnfc that operate on a codeDevicecode are methods of it. Now, there are other C libraries e.g. the libfreefare whose APIs operates on codenfcdevicecodees. For the sake of modularity, I want to place the code for each library I wrap into its own module. This leads to the problem, that I cant access private structure members from within other modules. I thought about the following solutionsp  ul lipMake codedcode a public member of codeDevicecodep  pThis would make it easy to access the underlying codenfcdevicecode from within other modules, but it makes it also easy to sidestep type safety. Additionally, I dont know whether cgo recognizes pointers to foreign types if they come from different modules. Finally, I lose flexibility if I change the structure of the Device type.pli lipAdd an accessor codefunc Device GetCPtr unsafe.Pointercodep  pThis solves the issues above but introduces the new issue that you suddently have access to an codeunsafe.Pointercode in a module that might not even import codeunsafecode.pli lipAdd an accessor codefunc Device GetCPtr uintptrcodep  pThis solves the aforementioned issue, as you have to manually cast the result to get a proper pointer.pli ul  pAre there any ways I missed Is there a better, more idiomatic way to provide access to the underlying codenfcdevicecodep

What that particular program does is to bring the mouse pointer to the center of the screen and when the button is realised it leaves it in the initial position. x1, y1 are always the center of my screen, in pixels.p  pI believe that internally this program gathers the displacement of the mouse while dragging and use it for user interaction.p  pMy question is is there a way to obtain the real mouse input rather than looking at the screen and searching for the mouse pointer  MouseGetPos  Is that achievable with AutoHotKeyp

Negative 3716 pWith my WCF service, I am solving an issue that has both performance and design effects.p  pThe service is a stateless RESTful PerCall service, that does a lot of simple and common thins, which all work like a dandy. But, there is one operation, that has started to scare me a lot recently, so there is the problemp  pClients make parametrized calls to the operation and the computation of the result requires lots of time to finish. But result to a call with identical parameters will always be the same, until data on the server change. And clients make an strongawful LOTstrong of calls with exact the same parameters. The server, however, cannot predict the parameters, that the users will like, so sadly enough, the results cannot be precomputed.p  pSo I came up with caching layer and store the result object as a keyvalue pair, where key respresents the parameters which lead to this result. And if the relevant data change, I just flush the cache. Still simple and no problems with this.p  pClient calls the service, server receives the call, looks, whether the result is already cached and returns it, if so. But, if the result is not cached yet, the client starts the computation. The computation may take up to 2 minutes average time 1015 seconds to finish and by that time, other clients may come and because the result is still not known to cache, each of them would start their own computation. Which is strongNOTstrong what we really want, so there is a flag, if someone has already started the computation with this parameters this is the place in code, where other callers code stops and waits for the computation to be finished and inserted into cache, from where each of the invoked instances will grab the result, return it to the client and dispose. And this is the part, which I am really struggling with.p  pBy now, my solution looks something like this before you read further, I want to warn you, because my experience is not near decent level and I still am a big noob in all c, wcf and related stuff... no need telling me Im a noob, because I am fully aware of thatp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeStopwatch sw  new Stopwatch sw.Start  while true      if Cache.Containsparameters  sw.Elapsed gt treshold         break     Thread.Sleep100   ...do relevant stuff here codepre  pAs you see, there are more problems with this solutionp  ol liHaving the loop, check and all this stuff does not only feel ugly, with many clients waiting this way, the resources tend to jump up.li liIf the operation fails the initial callers computation fails to deliver within the limits of treshold, I do not really know, which client has got to be next up trying the computation, or how, or even whether should I run the operation again, or return a fault to the client... strongEditstrong this is not related to synchronization, I am aware of the need for locking in some parts of my application, so my concerns are not synchronizationreated.li liWhat should I do when the relevant serverside data change while invoked code is still performing computation resulting in such result being a wrong one. ... More over, this has some other horrible effects on the application, but yeah, I am getting to the question hereli ol  pSo, like most of the time, I did my homework and performed qoogling around before asking, but did not succeed in finding some guidance that I would either understand or that would suit my issues and domain.p  pI got a strong feel, that I have to introduce some kind of static eventsbasedandorasynchronous class call it layer if you will, that does some tricks and organizes and manages all this things in some kind of a registertomeandiwillgiveyouapoke  pokeallregisteredthreads manner. But despite being able to certain extent to use the newly introduced tasks, TPL, and asyncawait, I not only have very limited experience on this field, more sadly, I really really need help explaining how it could come together with events or do I even need them... When i try  run little things in a testconsole application, I might succeed, but bringing it into this bigger environment of my wcf application, I struggle to get a clue.p  pSo guys I will gladly welcome every kind of relevant thoughts, advice, guidance, links, code and criticism touching my topic.p  pI am aware of the fact, it might be confusing and will do my best to clear all misunderstandings and tricky parts, just ask me for doing that.p  pThanks for helpp

Negative 3716 pI have a large list of items to be placed in a dropdownlist 1000 and am trying to figure out a way to create some sort of incremental selectlist or dropdownlist that makes json callbacks to the data source so that the page loads quicker.p  pI assume that I would use a combo box but i am not sure how to not load the full data set when the page builds. p  pIm thinking that using the autocomplete Jquery plugin might be part of the solution. There is also the fact that I will be loading an existing record into the form that may already ahve a selected item that is in the DDL.p  pAny tutorialsexamples that anyone is aware ofp
Negative 3716 pI am trying to determine if a logger exists for a Marker in Log4j 2.  The filter works when actually logging. The problem is when checking isEnabledlevel, marker.  If the MakerFilters are at the Configuration level, then it works as expected.  If at the logger or appender level, then it bypasses the marker and considers only the threshold level.  p  pLooking at the documentation, it looks like if accepteddenied is at the configuration level, then it will not check any other filters and that status will be honored, so that makes sense that it works here.  p  pWhat I am trying to figure out is how to configure it at the Logger level so that Logger.isEnabledLevel,Marker responds the same as when calling Logger.logLevel,Marker,msg.br Is there a way to configure this or is it the expected behavior that the two methods respond differentlyp  pTests run using Log4j 2.0rc1p  pThanksp  h2TestLog2.javah2  pHere the logging statements that check each Marker for being enabled.

ProjectStatus has a property called name and name can be either Closed or Open etc...p  pIm trying to display on a page all categories and the number of opened projects for that category next to the category name.p  pHow would I go about doing that. The problem Im seeing is that using grails gorm is that by default you cannot do something like p  precodecategory.findAll it.status.name  Opened .size  codepre  pbecause the objects are not loaded that deep. Now If I forced them to load, now for all categories Im potentially loading a bunch of projects just to get the status. Wouldnt the system take a huge hit in performance the higher amount of projects you have p  pThe thought of creating a counter in the category and updating it every time a project status changes makes me cringe. p  pI must just be sleep deprived because I cant see what the proper way of doing this would be.  If the way I mentioned first with the .findAll is the way to go, do I really have to worry about performance How would I go about implementing thatp  pThanks in advance for all your help.p

So they turn off the iPad iCloud synching within the app. p  pAt this point, strongmy understanding is that a user would expect the data to still be there, but from behind the scenes, its now LOCAL instead of iCloud based data which means, entries from the other device wont synchronise over to this device and vice versastrongp  pSo I am trying to achieve that. p  pstrongIssuestrongp  pI can get the data to migrate from the iCloud to the local store, but the issue is that because iCloud is still enabled on the device, the next time the app is run, I can see that iCloud is disabled within the app but the console still shows Using Local Storage 1 and then 0 and any data from the iPhone synchronises across to the iPad, even though the Use iCloud codeUISwitchcode is very clearly off. p  pHeres the main code doing the migrationp  precode voidmigrateiCloudStoreToLocalStore       NSLogMigrate iCloudToLocalStore     NSPersistentStore store  self.persistentStoreCoordinator.persistentStores.lastObject      NSURL storeURL  [[self applicationDocumentsDirectory] URLByAppendingPathComponentEnvylope.sqlite]     NSURL storeURL  [self.persistentStoreCoordinator.persistentStores.lastObject URL]     NSLogCurrent Store URL before iCloud to Local migration , [storeURL description]      NSDictionary localStoreOptions  nil     localStoreOptions   NSPersistentStoreRemoveUbiquitousMetadataOption  YES,                            NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption  YES,                            NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption  YES      NSPersistentStore newStore  [self.persistentStoreCoordinator migratePersistentStorestore                                                                                      toURLstoreURL                                                                                    optionslocalStoreOptions                                                                                   withTypeNSSQLiteStoreType errornil]      [self reloadStorenewStore]    voidreloadStoreNSPersistentStore store      NSLogReload Store             NSURL storeURL  [[self applicationDocumentsDirectory] URLByAppendingPathComponentEnvylope.sqlite]     NSDictionary localStoreOptions  nil     localStoreOptions   NSPersistentStoreRemoveUbiquitousMetadataOption  YES,                            NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption  YES,                            NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption  YES      if store          [self.persistentStoreCoordinator removePersistentStorestore errornil]           [self.persistentStoreCoordinator addPersistentStoreWithTypeNSSQLiteStoreType                                                   configurationnil                                                             URLstoreURL                                                         optionslocalStoreOptions                                                           errornil]     storeURL  [self.persistentStoreCoordinator.persistentStores.lastObject URL]     NSLogCurrent Store URL after iCloud to Local migration , [storeURL description]      NSLogDone reloading      [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]setBoolYES forKeyMigratedFromiCloudToLocal]     [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]synchronize]   codepre  pSure, theres some redundant code in there, but the codeNSLogcode for before iCloud to Local Migration showsp  precode Current Store URL before iCloud to Local migration filevarmobileApplications62CAFCEE450E410D9D564918DD70EC07DocumentsCoreDataUbiquitySupportmobile98457667A4674095BB7FEF36EB2B0FE1EnvyCloudCD08912EC135405695576B47C84ECEF9storeEnvylope.sqlite codepre  pThe NSLog for after the data has been migrated showsp  precodeCurrent Store URL after iCloud to Local migration filevarmobileApplications62CAFCEE450E410D9D564918DD70EC07DocumentsEnvylope.sqlite codepre  pThis clearly shows the data has been migrated over to the local store. However, at this point in the console, Im not sure what to expect, but ideally, this procedure should have the same effect as there not being iCloud enabled on the device at all if I delete my app, delete my iCloud account on the device and run the app, I get the expected  run the app WITHOUT any iCloud options. This is not happening because it continues to push forward iCloud updates. Without running the app again, data added in the other device syncs across here. With running the app again, the using local storage 1 and 0 appear in the console. p  pTherefore, the data may have been migrated to a local store, but disabling iCloud within the app seems to have no effect. p  pI would really appreciate some thoughts on this. p  pstrongUpdate The solution has been found as a combination of both answers below.

Negative 3716 pIve got a 3 level table inheritance, and when I attempt to insert into the database, Doctrine is sensible enough to insert at the lowest level, and the highest level  embut not at the middle levelem.p  pIm unsure whether what were attempting to do is properly supported by Doctrine  the lack of examples on the docs and Google suggest that it might not be. If it is supported, what could I be doing wrongp  pEDITp  pA slightly better explanationp  pI have 3 tables A, B and C. Ive got a discriminator map such that C extends B, and B extends A. When I try an insert into Table A then Doctrine is clever enough to insert into C and A, but emnotem B.p

Negative 3716 pIve created my own codeMyDatecode class. It basically wraps a codeLongcode value with some pretty codetoStringcode functions. Ive implemented codeequalscode and codecompareTocode. my program reads some data and instantiates object of classes that hold this codeMyDatecode class. Problem is that sometimes that data is bad so I created a codepublic static final long NODATE  Long.MINVALUEcode so that I could initiate a new instance that is empty replace the null in the containing class so to avoid NullPointerExceptions. Ive also implemented a constructor with no arguments that inits the codeLongcode value to codeNODATEcode.p  pMy Problem I want to check if a codeMyDatecode is valued as codeNODATEcode. I cant compare to codeNODATEcode since its codeLongcode and not codeMyDatecode. One way to do this isp  pcodeif someObject.myDate.equalsnew MyDatecode.p  pBut it seems like a waste to create an object just to make the comparison Another way is to implement codeMyDate.amINoDatecode method.p  pIs there another way I was thinking of creating an static instance of codeMyDatecode that is inited to NODATE and to compare to it. But how can I compare my non static objects to this static object p

Negative 3716 pI am working on porting an Access application to vb.net. One of the constraints is that the user forms should look the same. For the most part I managed to get it right, except for the button captions, the text property in vb.net. p  pIt looks like the button control in vb.net has some sort of default margin on the control surface. No matter what I use for the text alignment it will truncate the text and move it to the next line. The text itself fits the size of the control. p  pI have been playing with the onpaint event of the button but have been unable to get t to do what I want.p  pSo I guess I am looking for a way to either redraw the button text on the control the way I want it or change the default margin on the button surface so the control text is not truncated.p  pAny help to point me in right direction will be appreciated, thanks in advancep

Negative 3716 pRight, so I have a 2 part sorting algorithm. Its all based on an array of 14 random integers. For examplep  precodeint[] a  9,2,4,8,9,4,3,2,8,1,2,7,2,5 codepre  pNow, the first thing Im trying to figure out how to do is to count how many a certain number exists in the original array. So, we know that 1 exists once, and 2 exists four times in the original array. But as easy as it is to visually see this, what if we dont have access to the original array. So I need to craft a method that will count how many of each number 19 exists and put this in a new array called strongcountstrong. So that index 0 in count would represent the integer 1 and would have a value of 1. Index 1 will represent the integer 2 and have a value of 4. And so on and so forth. Here is what Ive got so far but Im stuck. Sorting is pretty challenging for me.p  precodepublic static void mainString[] args     int[] countFinal  1,4,1,2,1,0,1,2,2  The number of times a number 19 appears in a[].    int[] sortedFinal  1,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,5,7,8,8,9,9  What we need as a final product.   int[] a  9,2,4,8,9,4,3,2,8,1,2,7,2,5   int[] count     int[] sorted     countHowManya, 1   countHowManya, 2   countHowManya, 3   countHowManya, 4   countHowManya, 5   countHowManya, 6   countHowManya, 7   countHowManya, 8   countHowManya, 9     public static int countHowManyint[] array, int value     Gathering a count for how many times a number 19 exists and adding it to count[]   int howManyCount  0   for int i  0 i lt array.length i         if array[i]  value               howManyCount            System.out.printlnhowManyCount   count  new int[9]   count[howManyCount]   System.out.printlnArrays.toStringcount  Testing the input   return howManyCount       codepre  pIt appears to count the number of times an item in the array exists properly. Now I just gotta figure out how I can add that value into a new array count[] and do it for each countHowMany. This is the part Im stuck on.p  pOnce I have figured out count[] I can use it to create sorted[]. Now what sorted is supposed to do is take the data from the original array and count[] and create a new array that sorts it in ascending order and allows duplicates. So, since 1 occurs once and 2 occurs four times, the new array would be sorted[]  1, 2, 2, 2, 2, ...p  pIts a relatively small program and a small amount of integers, so its ok that I create arrays as necessary. The key being that Im limited to using arrays and cannot use say ArrayLists for this.p

Negative 3716 pIm trying to set up the basics of an application using Ember on Rails, and Im getting this errorp  pError while processing route posts p  pIt would be helpful if Ember said something about the error, but it hasnt. Here is the code in question I believe I am including all parts needed. p  precode PostsRoute  App.PostsRoute  Ember.Route.extend     model function         return this.store.findpost          return [title fixture, title 2]          Router.  App.Router.mapfunction     location auto,    rootURL ,   this.resourceposts,  path       Routes.rb   resources posts do      resources comments   end   Post model  Ember App.Post  DS.Model.extend     title DS.attrstring,     description DS.attrstring,      imageFileName DS.attrstring,     imageContentType DS.attrstring,     imageFileSize DS.attrnumber,     imageUpdatedAt DS.attrdate,      createdAt DS.attrdate,     updatedAt DS.attrdate,      userId DS.attrnumber,     Posts controller.rb  class PostsController lt ApplicationController   beforeaction setpost, only [show, edit, update, destroy]    respondto html    def index     posts  Post.all     puts in PostsController index.      puts posts     respondwithposts   end    ...   Post Serializer class PostSerializer lt ActiveModelSerializer   attributes id, title, description, createdat, updatedat, userid, imagefilename, imagecontenttype, imagefilesize, imageupdatedat end codepre  pIm trying to understand what needs to be set up for Ember to receive data from the Rails API. Railswise, its returning data fine. p  pFrom what I understand, here is how the app goes. Ember checks the route here, PostsRoute first. The route is expected to have a model, so it looks at the Model property. Here, the model property makes a call to the Store to get all posts. i.e. this.store.findpost. [replacing this call with a static array seems to work fine.]p  pThis makes a call to the Rails PostsControllers index function. I can confirm that this function is reached because of the print statements I put there. The index function returns a variable with the activerecord post models. p  pFrom here, the posts need to be JSONified for Ember to be able to use it. So they are put through a serializer, which, here, is postserializer.rb. This decides what properties to send as JSON form. p  pI suspect that there is some issue with the way I am handling this serialization part, since I have confirmed that the posts have actually been fetched in the index function of PostsController.rb, but have failed I believe to make the journey back to Ember. p  pWhat I dont understand is why. What is it that Im missing p  pIf it is any issue, there are some hasmany relationships I have not included yet because I first wanted to get this going. And for completeness, here is the full error as per chromes consolep  precodeError while processing route posts ember.jsbody115376 logToConsole ember.jsbody115376 logError ember.jsbody126315 defaultActionHandlers.error ember.jsbody126272 triggerEvent ember.jsbody126363 trigger ember.jsbody146876 Transition.trigger ember.jsbody146721 anonymous function ember.jsbody146526 tryCatch ember.jsbody147310 invokeCallback ember.jsbody147322 publish ember.jsbody147293 publishRejection ember.jsbody147235 anonymous function ember.jsbody129438 DeferredActionQueues.invoke ember.jsbody1682 DeferredActionQueues.flush ember.jsbody1752 Backburner.end ember.jsbody1138 Backburner.run ember.jsbody1193 run ember.jsbody118226 hash.error emberdata.jsbody11886 fire jquery.jsbody13120 self.fireWith jquery.jsbody13232 done jquery.jsbody19278 callback jquery.jsbody19686 codepre

Negative 3716 pI currently have a navigation controller that contains one view controller and two table view controllers. When the user navigates to the second table view controller, they can press an  bar button item which modally presents another table view with a static cell that contains a text field. The user can enter text and press Done to save it. When my delegate method is called, the view controller is dismissed and that userentered string is appended to the array in the second view controller. The table view then displays that userentered text in a table cell. The array has been passed up the stack via the codeprepareForSeguecode method. This is currently working because I can see the strings in the table view that the array was instantiated with in the first view controller.p  pMy problem occurs when the user navigates back down the stack to any view controller prior to the second table view, which contains the userentered strings displayed in cells. I have successfully been able to pass the data to the previous view controller, obviously, but after much research and testing, I am unable to successfully get the userentered string to persist. When I navigate to previous view controllers and then back go the second table view, the userentered data is gone, and the array contains only the initial data. p  pI understand that arrays in Swift are structures and the values are copied when passed up the stack. This makes sense as to why the userentered data disappears when I navigate to a previous view controller. The previous view controller does not actually contain that userentered data. Does this mean that I need to append the string to the array in the initial view controller instead of the array in the second table view controller If that is the case, I am unsure of how to access the initial view controller from the third view controller. p  pAll of the documents and tutorials that I have accessed are based on passing the data from the current view controller back to the previous view controller, which is the delegate that then dismisses the view controller that accepted the input. p  pHow can I pass the userentered string from the last view controller back to the initial view controllerp

Ultimately I would like to do this process many times with different values for velocity etc., so I need a fluid way to change the fixed parameters being used.p  pThanks in advance for any help, Christopherp

Negative 3716 pI have a table where I have to create percentages by looping on the same table. Here is the sample tablep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzE4gk.jpg altenter image description herep  pMy first hurdle is to create the Weightage, which for a given day, is the percentage of revenue divided by all the revenues for that franchise on that day. so in the example above, it is 150150200300  23.07, then it is 200650  30.7 and 300650  46.15 Note I did not take reporting period 112015 because to loop, we loop the table on that franchise records for that day.p  pThen I need a Franchise measure for the day, which would be Sum of Forecast  Weightage. In the example here it would be Sum 9123.07  9730.7  9246.15100  93.21. p  pCan someone help with a DAX that can generate this Franchise of 93.21 when i use slicer for North Thanksp  pQuestion Update on 2262015p  pThank you Abhijeet.p  pIf the Revenue column was a seperate table and joined just with the Account and Date Period 1st of the month to the main table, then I am unable to use these formulas. Revenue table had to be seperate table because they are at a month grain whereas the Franchise table is at a day grain. So Franchise Table to Revenue table is Many to One. I joined the Period and Account to create a key so I join the two tables. In the revenue table, Account and Month Period is a unique row. Here are the broken out tables, a hrefhttpoi62.tinypic.com9fsg8p.jpg relnofollowhttpoi62.tinypic.com9fsg8p.jpgap  pNow the Orange row on the Revenue table is valid row, where it is in the Revenue table but not being reported in the Franchise table. So when the weightage is calculated this row needs to be included too, in the Franchise South Total. Can someone guide how the DAX can be rewritten to accomodate this. Thanks I am a total beginner, and eventhough this is interesting, I find it difficult. p  pSo i still need to calculate  Weightage and then the Franchise Index. Thanksp

Negative 3716 pIm writing a program for synchronization between two child processes. The request isp  pImplement a concurrent program in C language that creates two children a sender and a receiver.  The sender loops reading a string from the standard input and preparing a message  of a single line in a file, then it signals to the receiver that the message is ready, it waits a signal from receiver that the string has been processed simply transformed to upper case and prints the processed string. The receiver loops waiting the signal of the sender, transforming it in upper case, and signalling to the sender that the string can be printed. The parent process waits the end on the two processes, which terminate when the message sent is the string end. The main process then has to print the number of sent messages.p  pSince for synch I have to use only signal, kill system calls, in my solution the kill system call doesnt wake up the Receiver process. For passing the PID of two childs I used two different files, each one for each PID. When the Sender works, and concurrently the Receiver goes to pause, at the end of Sender, when I do killcpid2,SIGUSR1, the Receiver remains on pause... Can you help me The code is here a hrefhttppastebin.comPrxq9E2G relnofollowhttppastebin.comPrxq9E2Gap

Negative 3716 pMy question is I have a asp.net web services and its azure project for creating a azure package that I deployed over azure. So that my webservice is online over auzure a hrefhttpsomeservices.cloudapp.netexposed relnofollowhttpsomeservices.cloudapp.netexposeda . I have another asp.net project that is not directly related to services no reference of service and use and with its own azure project to create cspkg etc. for deployment a hrefhttpmyproject.cloudapp.net relnofollowhttpmyproject.cloudapp.neta. Now I have two URLs hosted seperately one for web service and another for my project application.  Can I somehow add service project in my normal project so that  they have a single cspkg and settings to deploy only as a single URL, though web service can have more qualified URL to access. For example my application can say still use a hrefhttpmyproject.cloudapp.net relnofollowhttpmyproject.cloudapp.neta and services can be access something like a hrefhttpmyproject.cloudapp.netexposed relnofollowhttpmyproject.cloudapp.netexposeda  This will reduce the cloud cost of having different hosting and URL.p

Negative 3716 pI am currently working on a small application that is basically purely built with jQuery which taps into an API and loads up many about 25 images, gifs and codevideocodes per user request.p  pSo whenever a user input starts, all of these elements are being written into the DOM as codedivcodes with the image as an codebackgroundimagecode property, or a codevideocode tag respectively. A new input would then clear the DOM and redo the process, all via js.p  pNow, first of all, im emnotem talking about the AJAX requests, just to be clear. Whenever the elements are being written into the DOM, the Browser of course starts all of the classic GET requests to the resources imgur, gfycat, but they keep running until completion, even if their DOM element already got removed. p  pSo, say, a user makes three rapid inputs, and now his Browser is loading 75 imagesmp4s. Even worse, if any of the requests get stuck, the Browser might actually limit the requests and freeze everything until the first batch, which is now irrelevant to the user, is done.p  pIs there any way to resolve thisp

But the server does not receive them if on the router, whether the client is run on the router using local loopback or on the pc.p  pOn the router, no other programs were using port 6115.p  pIve checked the firewall configuration in codeetcconfigfirewallcode and it seems to allow packets from port 6115p  precodeconfig rule    option input ACCEPT    option output ACCEPT    option forward ACCEPT    option target ACCEPT    option proto tcp udp    option srcport 6115    option destport 6115    option name Allowmyudp    option src     option family ipv4 codepre  pIve tried to disable the firewall but nothing changes.p  pQuestion Can the firewall even interfere if I send the packets through local loopback 127.0.0.1 or should I be trying something other than messing with the firewallp  pIve heard the problem can be caused because my router device is bigendian, if that can cause the problem what can I do about itp  pIf relevant, here are the client and server codes for local loopbackp  pServerp  precodeint udpSocket, ndat struct sockaddrin serverAddr struct sockaddrstorage serverStorage socklent addrsize char buf[1024]  udpSocketsocketPFINET,SOCKDGRAM,0  serverAddr.sinfamilyAFINET serverAddr.sinporthtons6115 memsetserverAddr.sinzero,0,sizeof serverAddr.sinzero  bindudpSocket,struct sockaddrampserverAddr,sizeofserverAddr  addrsizesizeof serverStorage  while 1       ndatrecvfromudpSocket,buf,1024,0,struct sockaddrampserverStorage,ampaddrsize     printfDATA RECEIVED WITH u BYTESn,ndat   codepre  pClientp  precodeint udpSocket char buffer[1024]Hello [home] struct sockaddrin serverAddr socklent addrsizesizeof serverAddr  udpSocketsocketPFINET,SOCKDGRAM,0  serverAddr.sinfamilyAFINET serverAddr.sinporthtons6115 serverAddr.sinaddr.saddrinetaddr127.0.0.1 memsetserverAddr.sinzero,0,sizeof serverAddr.sinzero  bindudpSocket,struct sockaddrampserverAddr,sizeofserverAddr  sendtoudpSocket,buffer,1024,0,struct sockaddrampserverAddr,addrsize  printfSent...n codepre  pPlease give me suggestions on how to solve the problem if you have any.

Negative 3716 pIf you are an experienced Android programmer, you probably know Screen orientation causes the app to be saved and restored via the onSaveInstanceState and onRestoreInstanceState.p  pyou will probably also know that objects are not easy to restore via those features, for example, if i create a database connection as followsp  precodeSQLiteDatabase mydb  openOrCreateDatabasedbn.trim.toLowerCase, 0, null codepre  pAnd then i execute a query for loading a record as followsp  precodeCursor rs  mydb.rawQuerySELECT  FROM MYTABLE where idgt0, null codepre  pAfterwards i can read next matching record just by usingp  precoders.moveToNext codepre  pNow here comes the semibad news... if during a secuential call to SQLite as i just explained, the user tilts the device, everything is deleted and then restored, except objects like the Cursor containing the result set. So, even the SQLite connection gets resetp  pNow, i know one can lock screen orientation during such tasks, whether we make it programmatically or via the Android Manifest. So, no problem.p  pNow, for the bad news... When you invoke an Intent using startActivityForResult, you cannot control the screen orientation of the invoked feature So, the host application is rotated even if you specifically configured the app to lock orientation. And there doesnt seem to be an intuitive fix for this.p  pThis causes a series of issues from null pointers to all sorts of crashes. p  pI dont have the control over when the user will finish the secuential SQLite call, or when the user will invoke startActivityForResult, Is there a way to avoid all this I was thinking if there would just be a way to lock the screen rotation of the whole device programmatically....p

Negative 3716 pstrongProblemstrong Readin data piles up, waiting to be written.p  pI have a basic ETL process that reads in a file, transforms the data, and then writes the data out to another file. Since Im on a multicore system, Im trying to perform this using multiple threads. My problem is that the readers are outpacing the writers many files end up read and their data transformed, but they pile up waiting to be written.p  pWhat I want is a balance between the files read and the files written, while still using multiple threads.p  pIve tried various things in the .NET library C 4.0. I think though that there is something I dont understand, and that this must be more complicated than simply using codeThreadcode or codeThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemcode or codeTaskcode the way they appear in the basic examples Ive found.p  pFor example, suppose I try something like thisp  precodeTask task  new Task gt PerformEtlsourceFile task.start codepre  pIf I log the files being read and the files being written, its something like a 10to1 ratio. On a longrunning process, this is unsustainable. p  pThere must be some basic multithreadingmultiprocessing pattern that Im ignorant of or cant call to mind.

Negative 3716 pI recently asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31323111this questiona about the changes to RegExp pattern validation that were introduced in AngularJS v1.3.

Negative 3716 pI have the following problem I want to show dialog fragment which background will be custom layout. But in constructor of this custom layout I inflate xml layout and after that I programatically add views according to the data in the constructor. So there is allocations in the constructor and it is super slow. Even if I try to animate the button which open the dialog, the animation of the button is laggy it shows in 45 frames . So obviously it is not a good practice to allocate and add so many objects in the constructor of this custom layout, but how can I avoid this I want to add views according to the data, because of that I cannot add them all in the layout that I inflate. I cannot copy code, because it is work related. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 3716 pI write in a custom scripting language a lot. I have a vim syntax file which is great for syntax highlighting when editing in vim.p  pI write in several languages throughout the day on an almost daily basis.

Unfortunately, for my custom scripting language, Komodo just sets it as file type Text.p  pIs there a way I can tell Komodo that files with extension .xyz are of file type XYZ If I have a xyz.vim file, is there an easy way to have Komodo use that for syntax highlighting or an easy way to importconvert to a Komodo format so I dont have to reinvent the wheelp  pThanksp

Negative 3716 pI have two issues with an editable data table with a custom validator that performs business logic validation. p  pFirst issue is that when custom validator throws validation exception, those are not shown in pgrowl or pmessages. But the field is highlighted red, so I know validation failed as expected.

I was expecting Primefaces to call validation again, and not perform the action. However, the action of the commandButton is called only the model is not updated with the invalid value provided by the user.

Negative 3716 pI am trying to replace database pessimistic lock with Curator interprocess lock. With a database lock, I take a codeselect for updatecode lock on an entity at the beginning of a transaction and it is released when the transaction is committed. The transaction could span over multiple methods and if any method in the chain tries to acquire this lock again, it gets it as it is running in the same transactionthread.p  pNow with zookeeper lock, the examples that Ive seen look like thisp  precodeInterProcessMutex lock  new InterProcessMutexclient, lockPath if  lock.acquiremaxWait, waitUnit        try                do some work inside of the critical section here          finally              lock.release       codepre  pThis would create a problem if I service call spans over multiple methods and any of those methods individually tries to acquire this lock. I dont want the lock to be passed around as these are independent business methods. Could there be some servicefactory implementation which could return this same lock object if I am running in same threadp
