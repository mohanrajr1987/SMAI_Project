This plugin asks me for an API key and sends me to the page a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comapps relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comappsa in order to create an app and get an API key. But when I try to create an app it tells me p  blockquote   pNot Authorized To Manage Apps This account is not authorized to manage   apps. Please use your verified personal Facebook account to create and   manage your apps.p blockquote  pI have been investigating and seems that my problem is because I have a business account on  facebook. So my questions are  How works facebook comments in WordPress are comments made in WordPress published in facebook, facebook comments are going to be published in my WordPress or both of them  Is there a way to integrate facebook comments on my website with a business account  If I create the page with my personal profile and then create an app to integrate the comments in facebook, will this facebook comments on WordPress go to be related to my profile or to my pagep  pLike you can see, I am very confused on how to go about connecting WordPress and facebook. Any extra explanation apart from this questions about facebook pages and how to connect with WordPress will be great.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 382 pIm looking for feedback on peoples experiences with developing sites that work across browsers.  It seems to me there are at least two obvious ways to approach the task of making your sitewebapp work across browserp  ol liConstantly test across all supported browsers every step of the way orli liPick a browser, get everything working in it as a reference implementation and then make all the other browsers match the reference implementation.li ol  pEach approach has an obvious drawback  the problem with 1 is that you end up doing a lot of unnecessary work  especially if you are developing a webapp that is going through a lot of iterationsprototypingspikes etc.  You will make a bunch of stuff work across browsers that will subsequently be discardedremoved.p  pThe disadvantage to approach 2 is that while it makes the initial development much quicker and more painful it makes it much harder to figure out where some of the specific errors arose, especially for more complex issues  whereas if you had been developing for all browsers at once you should catch it right away and know what changes introduced the problems.p  pA somewhat obvious third option would be a hybrid approach, but it seems to me that you would end up losing more by experiencing both of the problems with 1 and 2 than you would gain from the benefits of doing both.p  pWhat have you found to be the most effective ways to approach this challenge p

Negative 382 pUsually a mobile dev would not have to do this because the smartminimise feature handles it.p  pBut I need to do it myself because my mobile app is kicked off by a bootstrapper app.p  pThe start menu icon kicks off the bottstrapper which downloads a target version from a web service, kicks it off and then closes.

However, this kicks off the bootstrapper and results in a second copy of the client.p  pThis question comes up everywhere on the net for desktop apps and is in fact on this site.  The usually cited solution is to use a combination of Process.GetProcessesByName combined with API calls to reactivate the process once found.

Negative 382 pIm looking at generating pseudorandom onetimepasswords that are time sensitive.p  pTo send a message, the user enters their password which gets hashed together with the message.

Negative 382 pTLDR strongAdding any nonbuiltin functions to Array.prototype AND Function.prototype will cause the IE8 native JSON parser to get a stack overflow when parsing any JSON that contains an array, but only when you also pass a reviver function into JSON.parse.strongp  pThis started out as a question, but I answered my own original question, so now Ill ask can anyone think of a workaround for this IE8 bug that doesnt involve eliminating all JS libraries that modify Array.prototype and Function.prototypep  pemOriginal questionemp  pI have about 13k of JSON data to parse. The structure of the data is an object with a single value that is a nested array.p  precode value[[ stuff ], [ more stuff], [ etc ]]  codepre  pIm using json2.js, which defers to the browser native JSON.parse when available. Im passing a reviver function into JSON.parse to handle dates properly. When IE8 is in IE7 emulation mode which causes it to use the scriptbased json2.js parser everything works fine. When IE8 is in IE8 mode which causes it to use the browsernative JSON parser it blows up with an out of stack space error. Firefox and Chrome, of course, work just fine with their browsernative JSON parsers.p  pIve narrowed it down to this if I pass even a donothing reviver function into JSON.parse, the IE8 native parser gets the stack overflow. If I pass in no reviver function, the IE8 native parser works fine, except it doesnt parse dates correctly.p  precode no error JSON.parsestuff   out of stack space error JSON.parsestuff, functionkey, val  return val  codepre  pIm going to play with my JSON data, to see if less data or less nesting of the data can avoid the error, but I was wondering if anyone had seen this before, or had any other suggested workarounds. IE8 is slow enough already, it would be a shame to disable native JSON for that browser because of this bug.p  pUPDATE In other cases, with different JSON data, Im getting a javascript error lineinfo is undefined when I use the IE8 native parser with a reviver function, and no error if I use no reviver function. The string lineinfo does not appear anywhere in any of my source code.p  pUPDATE 2 Actually, this problem seems to be caused by Prototype 1.6.0.3. I was unable to reproduce it in an isolated test page until I added in the Prototype library.p  pUPDATE 3p  pThe reason prototype.js breaks the IE8 native JSON parser is this Adding any nonbuiltin functions to Array.prototype AND Function.prototype will cause the IE8 native JSON parser to get a stack overflow when parsing any JSON that contains an array, but only when you also pass a reviver function into JSON.parse.p  pThe Prototype library adds functions to both Array.prototype and Function.prototype, but this applies equally to any other library that does the same thing. This bug in the IE JSON parser is exposed by Prototype and Ext, but not jQuery. I havent tested any other frameworks.p  pHere is a completely standalone reproduction of the problem. If you remove the Function.prototype line, or the Array.prototype line, or remove the array from the JSON string, you wont get the out of stack space error.p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN      httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt  lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtlttitlegt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt  Function.prototype.test1  function   Array.prototype.test2  function    window.onload  function      alertJSON.parse foo [1,2,3] , functionk,v  return v    ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 382 pI want to have a database table that keeps data with revision history like pages on Wikipedia. I thought that a good idea would be to have two columns that identify the row codename, versioncode. So a sample table would look like thisp  precodeTABLE PERSONS     id      int,     name    varchar30,     version int,     ...  some data assigned to that person. codepre  pSo if users want to update persons data, they dont make an UPDATE  instead, they create a new PERSONS row with the same codenamecode but different codeversioncode value. Data shown to the user for given codenamecode is the one with highest codeversioncode.p  pI have a second table, say, DOGS, that references persons in PERSONS tablep  precodeTABLE DOGS     id         int,     name       varchar30,     ownername varchar30,     ... codepre  pObviously, codeownernamecode is a reference to codePERSONS.namecode, but I cannot declare it as a Foreign Key in MS SQL Server, because codePERSONS.namecode is not uniquep  pstrongQuestionstrong How, then, in MS SQL Server 2008, should I ensure database integrity i.e., that for each DOG, there exists at least one row in PERSONS such that its PERSON.name  DOG.ownernamep  pIm looking for the most elegant solution  I know I could use triggers on PERSONS table, but this is not as declarative and elegant as I want it to be. Any ideasp  phr p  pstrongAdditional Informationstrongp  pThe design above has the following advantage that if I need to, I can remember a persons current codeidcode or codename, versioncode pair and Im sure that data in that row will never be changed. This is important e.g. if I put this persons data as part of a document that is then printed and in 5 years someone might want to print a copy of it exactly unchanged e.g. with the same data as today, then this will be very easy for them to do.p  pMaybe you can think of a completely different design that achieves the same purpose and its integrity can be enforced easier preferably with foreign keys or other constraintsp  phr p  pstrongEditstrong Thanks to Michael Gattusos answer, I discovered another way this relationship can be described. There are two solutions, which I posted as answers. Please vote which one you like better.p

To be more specific, the difficulty is in two areasp  ol lipstrongReceiving parametersstrong.  A lot of times I will have a search screen with multiple input fields and a button that calls the javascript search function.  I have to either put a bunch of code in the onclick of the button to retrieve and then martial the values from the input fields into the function call, or I have to hardcode the HTML input field namesIDs so that I can subsequently retrieve them with Javascript.  The solution Ive settled on for this is to pass the field namesIDs into the function, which it then uses to retrieve the values from the input fields.  This is simple but really seems improper.pli lipstrongReturning valuesstrong.  The effect of most Javascript calls tends to be one in which some visual on the screen changes directly, or as a result of another action performed in the call.  Reusability is toast when I put these screenaltering effects at the end of a function.  For example, after a search is completed I need to display the results on the screen.pli ol  pHow do others handle these issues  Putting my thinking cap on leads me to believe that I need to have an pagespecific layer of Javascript between each use in my application and the generic methods I create which are to be used applicationwide.  Using the previous example, I would have a search button whose onclick calls a myPageSpecificSearchFunction, in which the search field IDsnames are hardcoded, which marshals the parameters and calls the generic search function.  The generic function would return dataobjectsvariables only, and would not directly read from or make any changes to the DOM.  The pagespecific search function would then receive this data back and alter the DOM appropriately.p  pAm I on the right path or is there a better pattern to handle the reuse of Javascript objectsmethodsp

Negative 382 pIve been trying to figure out how to do this for several days now with only limited success. Ive managed to manually handle NSNotifications that tell me when the view orientation changes, then I use CGAffineTransformations to move my toolbar to the correct orientation.

So my question is, how can I add a toolbar to the OpenGLES view and have it autorotate I figure it will involve creating a new viewController, then adding the OpenGL view and toolbar to this view, but I dont have enough experience working with views and subviews to know the correct way to do this or even if this is the correct approach.

Negative 382 pHere is the scenariop  pI have successfully bound two objects from a native ObjC library with the codebtouchcode tool. The bound objects are a class and a protocol that acts as its Delegate object. The Delegate object contains both required and optional methods.

But in that case, the method will not be available to override when I will need it and I will have to create a new assembly with codebtouchcode to include it.p  pSo when I inherit the Delegate object like thisp  precodeprivate class MyDelegate  TheDelegate      public override void RequiredMethodstring par              inside RequiredMethod override       codepre  pI get the p  blockquote   p...baseInThisMethodp blockquote  pexception inside the OptMethod method.

All these devices are behind a network bastion, and I use JSch to create TCP tunnels to the remote devices on demand.  This works well for protocols like TL1 that are TCP based.  However I do find myself needing to collect SNMP data as well.p  pThe bastion server I have access to is rather old and limited, and I dont have a lot of options to build a SNMP Proxy over there.  My question is if the community knows a clean, reliable way of programmaticly establishing tunnels as needed.  Ive looked at solutions such as a hrefhttpwww.qcnetwork.comvincedocdiversudpoversshtunnel.html relnofollowthis onea, but as I have thousands to potentially tens of thousands of possible ip addresses, a manual oneoff method is nonviable.   If need be, Ill push for a server capable of doing a robust snmp proxy, but I need to know there is no other way before I fight that battle.p

Negative 382 pThe basic setup is this  I have a vertical JSplitPane that I want to have a fixedsize bottom component and a resizing top component, which I accomplished by calling codesetResizeWeight1.0code.  In this application there is a button to restore the default window configuration.  The default height of the window is the desktop height, and the default divider location is 100 pixels from the bottom of the split pane.p  pTo set the divider location to 100px, I take the JSplitPane height  100.  The problem is, just before this I resize the JFrame, and since the code is in a button callback, the JSplitPane has been invalidated but not yet resized.  So the divider location is set incorrectly.p  pHere is a SSCCE.  Click the button twice to see the problem.  The first click will resize the window, but the divider location remains the same relative to the bottom of the window.  The second click properly moves the divider, since the window size didnt change.p  precodeimport java.awt.BorderLayout import java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.GraphicsConfiguration import java.awt.Insets import java.awt.Rectangle import java.awt.Toolkit import java.awt.event.ActionEvent  import javax.swing.AbstractAction import javax.swing.JButton import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JLabel import javax.swing.JSplitPane  public class SSCCE              param args unused           public static void mainString[] args          new SSCCE           private final JFrame f  new JFrameJSplitPane SSCE     private final JSplitPane sp  new JSplitPaneJSplitPane.VERTICALSPLIT,true      public SSCCE          f.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE          sp.addnew JLabeltop         sp.addnew JLabelbottom         sp.setResizeWeight1.0          f.getContentPane.addsp         f.getContentPane.addnew JButtonnew AbstractActionResize to Default              Override             public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                  restoreDefaults                      ,BorderLayout.PAGEEND          f.setSize400,300         f.setVisibletrue           void restoreDefaults          f.setSizef.getWidth, getDesktopRectf.getGraphicsConfiguration.height         sp.setDividerLocationsp.getSize.height  100   Does not work on first button press           Rectangle getDesktopRectGraphicsConfiguration gc          Toolkit toolkit  Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit         Dimension size  toolkit.getScreenSize         Insets insets  toolkit.getScreenInsetsgc         return new Rectangleinsets.left, insets.top, size.width  insets.left  insets.right, size.height  insets.top  insets.bottom        codepre  pI have thought of a few ways I might get around this, but they all seem sort of hackish.  So far the best idea Ive had has been to call codef.validatecode in between setting the frame size and setting the divider location, but Im concerned there might be side effects to forcing validation early.p  pThe other option I thought of is to use codeEventQueue.invokeLatercode to put the call to set the divider location at the end of the event queue.  But that seems risky to me  Im assuming the JSplitPane will have been validated at that point, and Im concerned that may be a faulty assumption to make.p  pIs there a better wayp

Negative 382 pI have used XDebug semisucessfully with PhpStorm and Mamp, but now I want to try using NetBeans for a project. But I cant get NetBeans to connect to XDebug. It just waits until I stop the debugger and then I get a message that NetBeans never got a connection to XDebug, and it asks me to check the settings in php.ini.p  pNow, as I said it has worked ok with PhpStorm, so I dont think there should be anything wrong with the settings in php.ini, but anyway, here they arep  precode[xdebug] zendextensionApplicationsMAMPbinphpphp5.3.6libphpextensionsnodebugnonzts20090626xdebug.so xdebug.remoteenableon xdebug.remotehandlerdbgp  xdebug.remotemodereq xdebug.remotehostlocalhost xdebug.remoteport9000   codepre  pOne thing that I found strange was that everyone talks about php.ini being located in ApplicationsMampconf, but in that folder there is no php.ini in my setup at least. In ApplicationsMampbinphpphp5.3.6conf on the other hand, there is. So thats the one I have modified. And since it works in PhpStorm I figure it must be right...p  pBut then, why isnt NetBeans able to connect Im also using the XDebug plugin for Safari to hook it up in the browser. And the port in NetBeans is set to 9000 as in the php.ini file.p  pIm using NetBeans 7.0.1 and php5.3.6.p  pAnything else Im missingp  pEDITp  pWell, I found the problem for why XDebug wasnt connecting anyway I am using the addin for Safari for XDebug, and apparently it had its own setting for IDE Key, set to 1, while NetBeans had netbeansxdebug set. Once I changed it to the latter in the addin I got a connection. The problem is I still get some sort of error. It says 404 Page not found when I hit the debugger, and the address in the address field is a hrefhttplocalhostappnetbeansindex.phpXDEBUGSESSIONSTARTnetbeansxdebug relnofollowhttplocalhostappnetbeansindex.phpXDEBUGSESSIONSTARTnetbeansxdebugap  pAny idea what is going on herep  pBTW, just hitting run inside NetBeans works fine and opens a hrefhttplocalhostappnetbeans relnofollowhttplocalhostappnetbeansa I have used modrewrite to remove the index.php part of urls in CodeIgniterp  pEDIT 2  I found that the index.php part of the address was because in the run configuration in NetBeans there was an index file setting that was set by default to index.php. If I removed that to have CodeIgniter controller urls without the index.php I got the correct url, but with the xdebu stuff appended after it. But still I get the 404 Page not found when I use the debugger command, but not when I use the run command.p  pWeirdly enough what I can do is I can hit debug, ignore the fact that it goes to 404 Page not found, and go back to the IDE, hit run and if I have a breakpoint set it will then stop at that breakpoint.p  pBut again, this is not exactly what I would consider normal debugging behaviour... So if anyone knows what is going on I would love to hear it...p

Negative 382 pIm developing and Android app. As a completely secondary feature, it will allow users to encrypt some strings.p  pI know AES 256 bits is much more recommended to use than DES 56 bits.

Negative 382 pI am having troubles with a polymorphic association in Rails.

Negative 382 pSo, kind of vague question, and Im afraid I really cant be very specific. I have a solution previously in VS2008, .net 3.5. We wanted to upgrade to 2010 .net 4.0 to make use of MEF. The project is a mixture of C and cCLI. After lots of finagling with project settings, I can finally get the project to build. However, when I try to launch it with debugging, absolutely nothing happens. It build the project, but then says Build Succeeded Debug AND Releasep  pAnyone have any ideasp

Negative 382 pI am building a treelike data structure out of associative arrays. Each key is 12 characters. Keys are unique to their respective level.

My setting is thisp  ul liI have three C projects, one of them a static library proj1, proj2, lib1li liBoth proj1 and proj2 use lib1li liproj1 and proj2 compile to executables running on different Arduino boardsli liAll three projects need values for configuration variables e.h. UDP port to use, debug level, etc.li liproj1 and proj2 are actually very similiar and share many configuration variablesli liproj1 and proj2 need differing configuration values, also for lib1li ul  pI need a simple solution to configure all three. I need it to be low on resource usage, as I am memoryconstrained deployed on Arduino.p  hr  pMy first solution was a configuration.h file in each project, containing defines for the respective project.p  pProblem with this approach I cannot define differing values for lib1 from proj1proj2. Say, lib1 defines UDPPORT, then I cannot specify a different UDPPORT in proj1proj2 which lib1 will actually use.p  hr  pOf course I could pass all these configuration values as parameters at runtime. To save memory and runtime, I would prefer a compile time solution however.p
Negative 382 pI have been reading about the Page LifeCycle. I understand the LifeCycle, however, its not clear on what to do, and when to do it. The problem is I use PageLoad to get database values, and set form fields. I use a buttons onClick method to update the database. However, the form fields text properties were set during PageLoad, so its really only updating the database with the OLD values.p  pPageLoad I gather data, and set control text properties to reflect data. ButtononClick I update the database from the form Problem Its updating values gathered from PageLoad and not the actual form.p  pCertainly, I am not supposed to perform everything in the PageLoad. So where am I going wrong during this processp
Negative 382 pI am an experienced PHP Programmer but newbie with Asterisk. I have completed my business application which creates a list of numbers which are to be called.

I may be wrong with this, but too much of reading on internet has not helped me at all.p  pI have had a discussion with few consultants and they mentioned that they have a PRI Dialer and its licenced. I cannot use that software as I need something of mine so that I can sell it further. p  pI need some guidance to make such PRI Dialer. p  pRegards, p  pNitinp

Negative 382 pWell, its clear for me that the title of my question is too complicated. I just tried to make it as specific as possible. So, Ill try to explain the problem better.p  h2Problem contexth2  pLets assume we have three .NET projects in a solution. The main project is a simple console application strongApplicationAssemblystrong. This project has a reference to another managed assembly library strongDirectlyReferencedLibrarystrong. At the same time DirectlyReferencedLibrary refers to strongIndirectlyUsedLibrarystrong.p  pSo, the project usages looks like that strongApplicationAssembly  DirectlyReferencedLibrary  IndirectlyUsedLibrarystrong.p  pNotice that ApplicationAssembly doesnt use directly any type declared IndirectlyUsedLibrary. Lets also assume that all types declared in these assemblies reside in the same namespace.p  pThis solution compiles and works fine.p  h2Weird problemh2  pThe problem occurs when I have together the following conditionsp  ol lithe strongApplicationAssemblystrong project has usages of LINQ expressions. For example, if there is the invocation of Select on any object of enumerable type.li liThe strongDirectlyReferencedLibrarystrong declares a class which has a generic extension method with a type restriction. The type restriction says that the generic type must be a descendant of a class from the strongIndirectlyUsedLibrarystrong.li ol  pHere is the example of a such class.p  precodeusing System  namespace Test      public static class UnUsedType               Its a generic extension method with a type restriction.         public static void MagicltTgtthis T this              Its a type restriction that uses a type from the IndirectlyUsedLibrary.             where T  ProblemType                      Console.WriteLineI do nothing actually.                codepre  pWhen I try to compile this project, I get the following errorp  blockquote   pError strongThe type Test.ProblemType is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Negative 382 pIm writing a program in .NET c. Im sending a broadcast ping on my local network. All of my target devices are able to respond to a ping broadcast, and indeed i track all of their responses in Wireshark. My goal is to retrieve IP addresses of all responding stations.p  pProblem is, Microsofts API does not include support for recording all replies in a given time interval.Functions like IcmpSendEcho simply return on first reply although the API states that it can record more than one icmp reply, this is a known issue and after googling and searching here, everyone reports the same problem with these functions.p  pWhat can I do to achieve my goal without going too lowlevel for reply fetching Does windows hold some sort of a record of icmp history Ill be grateful for any suggestionsp
Negative 382 pI am having a MediaPlayer instance that is preparing a network stream. While it is still preparing I am allocating another MediaPlayer instance and trying to set the datasource to a local file. setDataSource method blocks until the first MediaPlayer instance finishes preparing.

Negative 382 pLet me start off by saying I know this is probably not the correct way to do this, but I am sure someone will point me in the right direction p  pstrongProject Backgroundstrongp  pWhat I am trying to achieve is this I have an index page on my root and four php pages  about, contact, location, and faqs  that reside in a folder called external. When the index page loads it will display four check boxes  about, contact, location, and faqs. When one of the check boxes get checked a div will slide down and show the contents of the corresponding php page via load. The user will now have the option to add or remove elements of the php page to customize and taylor to their needs. Once the user completes the editing they simply click the done button and php spits out another php file with the changes so the user can download the file.p  pStay with me here , so basically the idea here is to have a barebones file that the user can change to fit their needs and will be able to download for their use once editting is complete.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pWhen the external php page is loaded the css works fine, but the JQuery does not work on the external page. I suspect it is due to the fact I am using one JQuery file that is called in my index file and there is some type of scope issue when I try to use it with elements in the external file. An example would be, when I try to access a link within the contact.php the query function will not work. Keep in mind the contact.php page is called in via load.p  pstrongFilesstrong p  pNote I understand I need to be more descriptive with my naming convention in regards to my divs, the css files is what I was told to use and I was not to make a different one p  pstrongindex.htmlstrongp  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 StrictEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1strict.dtdgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gt lttitlegtCR8amp1071lttitlegt ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.7.0jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srclibraryjquery.jsgtltscriptgt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hreflibrarystyle.css gt ltheadgt  ltbodygt ltdiv idwgt ltdiv idmhgtltpgtCR8amp1071ltpgtltdivgt ltdiv idmcgt     ltdiv idpcgt         ltdiv idhgtltpgtSTEP 1  Select pages to buildltpgtlta hrefgtUNCHECK ALLltagtltdivgt         ltdiv idcbcgt             ltdiv idcbcr1gt                 ltform namefgt                 ltulgt                     ltligtltinput typecheckbox idcb nameindex valueindexgtltlabelgtIndex Page ltlabelgtltligt                     ltligtltinput typecheckbox idcb nameindex valuecontactgtltlabelgtContact Page ltlabelgtltligt                     ltligtltinput typecheckbox idcb nameindex valueaboutgtltlabelgtAbout Page ltlabelgtltligt                     ltligtltinput typecheckbox idcb nameindex valuecalendergtltlabelgtCalender Page ltlabelgtltligt                     ltligtltinput typecheckbox idcb nameindex valuenewsgtltlabelgtNews Page ltlabelgtltligt                 ltulgt                 ltformgt              ltdivgt             ltdiv idcbcr2gt                 ltformgt                 ltulgt                      ltligtltinput typecheckbox idcb nameindex valueimagegtltlabelgtImage Gallery ltlabelgtltligt                     ltligtltinput typecheckbox idcb nameindex valuetestimonialsgtltlabelgtTestimonials Page ltlabelgtltligt                     ltligtltinput typecheckbox idcb nameindex valuefaqsgtltlabelgtFaqs Page ltlabelgtltligt                     ltligtltinput typecheckbox idcb nameindex valuelinksgtltlabelgtLinks Page ltlabelgtltligt                     ltligtltinput typecheckbox idcb nameindex valueproductsgtltlabelgtProducts Page ltlabelgtltligt                 ltulgt                  ltformgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt            ltdivgt         ltdiv idpcgt                ltdiv idhgtltpgtStep 2  Page optionsltpgtltdivgt             ltdiv idoutputcontainergtltdivgt codepre  pstrongjquery.jsstrongp  precodefunction      h a.clickfunction              inputcheckbox.removeAttrchecked         outputcontainer img.remove         outputcontainer.children.slideUpfunction                      this.remove                   inputcheckbox.clickfunction              var cb  this.attrvalue         var active  false          testlink.liveclick,function                      alertIt Worked                    ifthis.ischecked                      outputcontainer.appendltdiv idcbcontainer classcontainergtltdiv idcontainerheadercb classcontainerheadergtltpgtcbltpgtltdivgtltdivgt             outputcontainer divfirstchild.cssbordertop,none             cbcontainer.hide.slideToggleslow,function                              containerheadercb.appendltimggt,srcgraphicsadditem.png,idexpandcb                               else                      expandcb.remove             cbcontainer.slideTogglefunction                              this.remove                                                 containerheadercb.clickfunction                                ifactive                                cbcontainer.appendltdiv idoptionpanecb classoptionpanegtltdivgt                  optionpanecb.loadexternalcb.php, function                                         optionpanecb.hide.slideToggleslow,function                                                containerheadercb img.attrsrc,graphicsremoveitem.png                                                            active  true                              else                                  optionpanecb.slideToggleslow,function                                          this.isvisiblecontainerheadercb img.attrsrc,graphicsremoveitem.pngcontainerheadercb img.attrsrc,graphicsadditem.png                                                     codepre  pstrongcontact.phpstrong I am grabbed one file to demonstratep  precodeltdiv classemcgt ltphp printtesting gt ltlabelgtSelect Amount of Text Sectionsltlabelgtltbr gt     ltselectgt     ltoptiongtSelect ...ltoptiongt     ltoption value1gt1 Sectionltoptiongt     ltoption value2gt2 Sectionsltoptiongt     ltoption value3gt3 Sectionsltoptiongt     ltoption value4gt4 Sectionsltoptiongt     ltselectgtltbr gtltbr gt ltpgtOnce the user selects the amount of text sections and desired contact fields, jquery will populate the amount of required header and text area sections for the user to fillin desired text.

Negative 382 pIm debating the pros and cons of passing texture coordinates to a GLSL shader in various ways.p  pIm rendering a lot of instance data. I have one basic model, and then I pass a Transformation Matrix and a TextureSprite Index to my shader. Each model is then rotated and translated as per the transformation matrix, and the texture is decided as per this snippetp  precodeTexCoord0  vec2TexCoord.xTexIndex16,TexCoord.yTexIndex1616 codepre  pThe thing I dont like about this is that Ive hardcoded the sprite and texture size. I could use uniforms to pass this information along, but then I still have the limitation that my sprite cant vary from instance to instance not that I have a planned use case for this. Moreover, its a bit more computation on the GPU to determine the coordinates of the sprite.p  pAnother method I could use would be to specify an entire Rect which would delimit the position, width and height of the sprite within the texture map. However, this would require specifying 4 floats 16 bytes of information, rather than a single texture index byte. Multiply that by, say, 200K instances and were looking at about 3 MB of data in addition to the other data. I dont know if that is considered a lot in todays day and age or not.p  pShould I be focusing on easing the computation in my GLSL shaders or minimizing the size of my buffers I hear that transferring data to the GPU is often the bottleneck, but recopyng the data to the buffer will be very seldom compared to the number of vertices it has to render every frame.p  hr  pLikewise, Im considering taking out my model transform matrix and replacing it with a codevec3code and codevec2code for translation and rotation respectively I only need 2 degrees of rotation which would knock me down from 16 floats to 5, and then I can just rebuild the matrix in the vertex shader. Again, this takes away some flexibility, and Im not sure of the cost savings.p

Negative 382 pWe need to consume a SOAP 1.1 Web Service, developed using Java, from within a C.Net 4.0 application.  We have no access to the service programming or the server it resides on.

That said, having a title only seems to exacerbate the clipping issues.p  pTechnically the number of items presented is extreme  the average user would not see all of these items at once. However, in the case that all the items are applicable, I would prefer not to have clipped buttons.p  pAs a side note, Ive seen this occur every once in a while other apps wish I could remember which one atm, but cant, so Im thinking this isnt just my code, but something wrong with the way the action sheet and its popover interact when displaying on an iPad where the border may come into play.p  pAny thoughts on how to fix, mitigate, get around, etc.p

Negative 382 pFirst of all, I am trying to do all this disaster in c .net 4 so if you come up with some code to help me that would be appreciated but really anything would help at this point.p  pI have a situation where I have a device that can only get GSM Cell information incidentally via the codeATKCELLcode command so I have a collection of values about cell towers each has LAC, MCC, MNC, Cell ID, Signal Strength and the first Timing Advance.  I think, therefore, I am in a good place to be able to come up with some sort of longitude and latitude coordinate albeit inaccurate, but, well meh.  This is where I am reaching out for help because now my little brain is confused...p  pI can see various services that provide cell code resolution Google, Open Cell ID, etc and they take LAC,MCC etc as arguments and return a coordinate.  I figure that what they return would, therefore, be the coordinate of the given tower I pass in.

Negative 382 pPretty basic usage scenario here. I want to save the user who created an object and the user who last modified it. However, its an inlined model so I, of course need to use codesaveformsetcode. The Django docs have the following example codep  precodeclass ArticleAdminadmin.ModelAdmin     def saveformsetself, request, form, formset, change         instances  formset.savecommitFalse         for instance in instances             instance.user  request.user             instance.save         formset.savem2m codepre  pThe thing is, if you notice, since codesupercode is never called, this is a deadend. If the codeModelAdmincode is subclassed and this method is overridden in the same way, you lose the functionality inherent in the parent. This matters because this is such a common usage scenario that I want to factor out the functionality, so I created the followingp  precodeclass TrackableInlineAdminMixinadmin.ModelAdmin     def saveformsetself, request, form, formset, change         instances  formset.savecommitFalse         for instance in instances             if hasattrinstance, createdby and hasattrinstance, modifiedby                 if not instance.pk                     instance.createdby  request.user                 instance.modifiedby  request.user             instance.save         formset.savem2m         superTrackableInlineAdminMixin, self.saveformsetrequest, form, formset, change codepre  pI tacked on the call to codesupercode out of habit more than anything else, not thinking that it actually will cause the formset to save twice. Nevertheless, it still works in every scenario except one deleting. As soon as you try to delete an inline in the admin, you get an error. The errors pretty vague and not really relavent to my question here, but I believe its related to trying to save the formset again after youve just deleted one of the instances in it. The code works just fine when the call to codesupercode is removed.p  pLong and short, is there any way that Im missing to both customize the formset saving behavior emandem allow subclasses to do their own overridingp

Negative 382 pI saw this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2797191howtosplitagitrepositorywhilepreservingsubdirectoriesquestiona, but the answer does not discuss preserving the history of files that have been moved prior to the splitting of the first repository.p  pWhat Im interested is the following scenario there is initially one repo, and some files have been moved around in this repo at various times due to refactoring. Now, we are splitting this initial repo by choosing a subset of the files from this repo to create another. If we perform codefilterbranchcode with the codesubdirectoryfiltercode argument, we can restrict the new repo to only the history relevant to the remaining files.br However, after some experimentation, this seems to destroy history in the files that were created prior to the last time the file was moved i.e., codegit log followcode no longer has any record of file renames to follow.p  pIs there any way around this so that codegit blamecode and codegit logcode can still follow the full history of the file when performing the codefilterbranchcode command, or is there any other way to preserve the history of files that have been moved or renamedp

This is the output when result is goodp  precodeNumber of recursions 10 Length of cluster 10 [[1 1 1 0 1]  [1 1 0 1 1]  [0 1 0 0 1]  [1 1 1 0 0]  [0 1 0 1 1]]  [[1 1 1 0 0]  [1 1 0 0 0]  [0 1 0 0 0]  [1 1 1 0 0]  [0 1 0 0 0]] codepre  pI was trying to get some idea how fast my algorithm is when cluster size is getting larger.

So, if someone has good will and energy you can browse through a code and maybe youll see something. I started using classes not while ago, so be prepared for lot of bad stuff.p  precodeimport numpy as np import matplotlib as mpl import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import time  class ProbabilityGridobject          This class gives 2D quadratic array a grid which is filled with     float values from 01, which in many cases represent probabilities           def initself, size2, dataTypefloat16         initialization of a grid with 0. values         assert sizegt1         assert dataTypefloat64 or dataTypefloat32 or dataTypefloat16         self.nsize         self.dataTypedataType         self.gridnp.zerossize, size, dtypedataType      def getGridself         returns a 2D probability array         return self.grid      def getSizeself             returns a size of a 2D array         return self.size      def fillRandomself         fills the grid with uniformly random values from 0 to 1         nself.n         self.gridnp.random.randn, n      def fixedProbabilitiesself, p         fills the grid with fixed value from 0 to 1         assert plt1.0         self.gridpnp.onesself.n, self.n   class PercolationGridobject          percolation quadratic grid filled with 1 and 0, int8     which represent a state.     Percolation grid is closly connected to probabilies grid.     ProbabilityGrid gives the starting probabilities will the [i,j] spot     be filled or not. All functions change the PercolationGrid.grid when     ProbabilityGrid.grid changes, so in a way their values are connected          def initself, size2, dataTypeint8                  initialization of PercolationGrid, sets uniformly 0 and 1 to grid                  assert sizegt1         assert dataTypeint64 or dataTypeint32 or dataTypeint8         self.nsize         self.dataTypedataType         self.gridnp.zerossize, size, dtypedataType         self.pGridProbabilityGridself.n         self.pGrid.fillRandom         self.useProbabilityGrid      def fillRandomself, min0, max1, distributionuniform         nself.n         self.gridnp.random.randomintegersmin, max, nn.reshapen, n      def getGridself         returns a 2D percolation array         return self.grid      def useProbabilityGridself use probability grid to get Percolation grid of 0s and 1es                  this method fills the PercolationGrid.grid according to probabilities         from Probability.grid                  comparisonGridnp.random.randself.n, self.n         self.gridnp.arraynp.floorself.pGrid.gridcomparisonGrid1, dtypeself.dataType        Here I used a trick. To simulate whether 1 will apear with probability p,        we can use uniform random generator which returns values from 0 to 1. If         the valueltp then we get 1, if valuegtp its 0.        But instead looping over each element, its much faster to make same sized        grid of random, uniform values from 0 to 1, calculate the difference, add 1        and use floor function which round everything larger than 1 to 1, and lower        to 0. Then valuep1 will give 0 if valueltp, 1 if valuegtp. The result is        converted to data type of percolation array.      def useFixedProbabilityself, p                  this method fills the PercolationGrid according to fixed probabilities         of being filled, for example, a large grid with parameter p set to 0.33         should, aproximatly have one third of places filed with ones and 23 with 0                  self.pGrid.fixedProbabilitiesp         self.useProbabilityGrid      def probabilityCheckself          this method checks the number of ones vs number of elements,         good for checking if the filling of a grid was close to probability         we had in mind. Of course, the accuracy is larger as grid size grows.         For smaller grid sizes you can still check the probability by          running the test multiple times.                  sumself.grid.sum         print floatsumfloatself.nself.n         this works because values can only be 0 or 1, so the sumsize gives         the ratio of ones vs size      def setGridself, grid         shapegrid.shape         i,jshape[0], shape[1]         assert igt1 and jgt1         if ij             print The grid needs to be NxN shape, Ngt1         self.gridgrid      def setProbabilitiesself, grid         shapegrid.shape         i,jshape[0], shape[1]         assert igt1 and jgt1         if ij             print The grid needs to be NxN shape, Ngt1         self.pGrid.gridgrid         self.useProbabilityGrid      def showPercolationsself         fig1plt.figure         fig2plt.figure         ax1fig1.addsubplot111         ax2fig2.addsubplot111         myColors[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]         mycmapmpl.colors.ListedColormapmyColors          subplt1ax1.matshowself.pGrid.grid, cmapjet         cbar1fig1.colorbarsubplt1          subplt2ax2.matshowself.grid, cmapmycmap         cbar2fig2.colorbarsubplt2, ticks[0.25,0.75]         cbar2.ax.setyticklabels[None, Percolated], rotationvertical  class Clusterobject     This is a class of percolation clusters     def initself, array         self.gridarray.getGrid         self.Nlenself.grid[0,]         self.cluster         self.numOfSteps0      next 4 functions return True if field next to given field is 1 or False if its 0     def moveLeftself, i, j         moveLeftFalse         assert iltself.N         assert jltself.N         if jgt0 and self.grid[i, j1]1             moveLeftTrue         return moveLeft      def moveRightself, i, j         moveRightFalse         assert iltself.N         assert jltself.N         if jltN1 and self.grid[i, j1]1             moveRightTrue         return moveRight      def moveDownself, i, j         moveDownFalse         assert iltself.N         assert jltself.N         if iltN1 and self.grid[i1, j]1             moveDownTrue         return moveDown      def moveUpself, i, j         moveUpFalse         assert iltself.N         assert jltself.N         if igt0 and self.grid[i1, j]1             moveUpTrue         return moveUp      def listOfOnesself         nested list of connected ones in each row          outlist[]          for i in xrangeself.N             outlist.append[]             helplist[]             for j in xrangeself.N                 if self.grid[i, j]0                     if jgt0 and self.grid[i, j1]0 or j0 and self.grid[i, j]0                         continue  condition needed because of edges                     outlist[i].appendhelplist                     helplist[]                     continue                 helplist.appendi, j                 if self.grid[i, j]1 and jself.N1                     outlist[i].appendhelplist         return outlist      def getClusterself, i0, j0, moveD[1, 1, 1, 1]         left, right, up, down         moveD short for moveDirections, 1 means that it tries to move it to that side, 0 so it doesnt try         self.numOfStepsself.numOfSteps1         if self.grid[i, j]1             self.cluster[i, j]True         else             print the starting coordinate is not in any cluster             return         if moveD[0]1             try if it comes to same point from different directions wed get an infinite recursion, checking if it already been on that point prevents that                 self.cluster[i, j1]                 moveD[0]0             except                 if self.moveLefti, jFalse check if 0 or 1 is left to i, j                     moveD[0]0                 else                    self.getClusteri, j1, [1, 0, 1, 1] right is 0, because we came from left         if moveD[1]1             try                 self.cluster[i, j1]                 moveD[1]0             except                 if self.moveRighti, jFalse                     moveD[1]0                 else                     self.getClusteri, j1, [0, 1, 1, 1]         if moveD[2]1             try                 self.cluster[i1, j]                 moveD[2]0             except                 if self.moveUpi, jFalse                     moveD[2]0                 else                     self.getClusteri1, j, [1, 1, 1, 0]         if moveD[3]1             try                 self.cluster[i1, j]                 moveD[3]0             except                 if self.moveDowni, jFalse                     moveD[3]0                 else                     self.getClusteri1, j, [1, 1, 0, 1]         if moveD0, 0, 0, 0             return      def getClusterCoordinatesself         return self.cluster      def getStatsself         print Number of recursions, self.numOfSteps         print Length of cluster, lenself.cluster         return self.numOfSteps, lenself.cluster codepre

Negative 382 pI am sure there are a number of strategies in doing this, but I am fairly weak in my understanding of how webservers process things and how to handle this is general. p  pWe have an asp.net webforms site with a sql server backend. What we would like to accomplish is as we update the site to, lets say version 1.5, we would like to keep all of our current clients looking at the 1.0 code until we roll out a database update for them. Once the database is updated, then they would point to the new version.p  pIs there a fairly simple way to accomplish this The model we have is we have the website hosted, but all their databases are local. I have thought about maybe having a couple of different web servers and cycle through each one like thisp  pServerA  version 1p  pServerB  version 2p  pServerC  version 3p  pAnd then once we get to version for, maybe overwrite version 1 and continue to loop through them that way This is why I mentioned I am serverhardware challenged because this idea might be laughable to those with knowledge. p

Negative 382 pI am writing an app with a database that has a slightly unusual schema. At least I think its unusual, I rarely do DB stuff.p  pAll my books tell me I should be using Entity Framework or some other ORM for DB access, but the examples they give are always bog standard CRUD. One table per entity, one row per object, active record etc.p  pMy schema uses disjoint subtypes, so multiple tables per entity, and has revision history so edits actually create a new row, but only in one table depending on the fields editedp  pDoes EF cater for this kind of custom behaviour or is it geared toward conventional patterns My understanding is that I create a schema or domain objects, and the database manipulation code is automatically generated. Can I override the default behaviour How else could I tell EF about my custom behaviourp  pI am more than willing to learn EF if it is going to make my life easier, but I dont want to put a lot of effort into learning a framework that I am going to end up fighting to make it do what I want. If this is the case I would rather just roll my own repositories and handle the SQL myself.p

Negative 382 pWe have recently taken over a project from an outsourcing company. This project uses Moles and Pex for unit testing, but since we have not had the project for long, I am not very familiar with the frameworks.p  pThat being said, we are busy upgrading this project to run in .Net 4. I have resolved most of the issues that have jumped out, but there is one that I cannot get a handle on.

I am not sure if this problem has to do with the pexmoles frameworks, but I thought I would mention it.p  pI have tried the usual things of removing and adding all the references and regenerating the moles assemblies.p  pHas anyone else run into this problem Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pstrongEDIT1strong Ok, after some more investigation into the build output, it appears as if it is not moles, but the .accessor files that are not generated correctly. I get the exact same problem as asked in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq79934691228513Unit test project cannot find assembly under test or dependenciesa, but unlike his problem, mine does not go away after deleting the accessor.p  pstrongEDIT2strong Turns out is is a program called Publicize.exe which falls over with that error. Still no idea why though. Looking at Fusion logs is looks like it does not search under the working directory for the dll that it is trying to generate the accessors for.

These bytes correspond to distinct objects in such a way that every emsem bytes think isi up to 32 will constitute a single object. One important fact is that this size emsem is the same for all objects, not stored within the objects themselves, and not known at compile time.p  pAt the moment, these objects are logical entities only, not objects in the programming language. I have a comparison on these objects which consists of a lexicographical comparison of most of the object data, with a bit of different functionality to break ties using the remaining data. Now I want to sort these objects emefficientlyem this is really going to be a bottleneck of the application.p  h1Ideas so farh1  pIve thought of several possible ways to achieve this, but each of them appears to have some rather unfortunate consequences. You dont necessarily have to read all of these. strongI tried to print the central question of each approach in bold.strong emIfem you are going to suggest one of these approaches, emthenem your answer should respond to the related questions as well.p  h21. C quicksorth2  pOf course the C quicksort algorithm is available in C applications as well. Its signature matches my requirements almost perfectly. But the fact that using that function will prohibit inlining of the comparison function will mean that every comparison carries a function invocation overhead. I had hoped for a way to avoid that. strongAny experience about how C codeqsortrcode compares to STL in terms of performance would be very welcome.strongp  h22. Indirection using Objects pointing at datah2  pIt would be easy to write a bunch of objects holding pointers to their respective data. Then one could sort those. There are two aspects to consider here. On the one hand, just moving around pointers instead of all the data would mean less memory operations. On the other hand, not moving the objects would probably break memory locality and thus cache performance. Chances that the deeper levels of quicksort recursion could actually access all their data from a few cache pages would vanish almost completely. Instead, each cached memory page would yield only very few usable data items before being replaced. strongIf anyone could provide some experience about the tradeoff between copying and memory locality Id be very glad.strongp  h23. Custom iterator, reference and value objectsh2  pI wrote a class which serves as an iterator over the memory range. Dereferencing this iterator yields not a reference but a newly constructed object to hold the pointer to the data and the size emsem which is given at construction of the iterator. So these objects can be compared, and I even have an implementation of codestdswapcode for these. Unfortunately, it appears that codestdswapcode isnt enough for codestdsortcode. In some parts of the process, my gcc implementation uses insertion sort as implemented in codeinsertionsortcode in file codestlalog.hcode which moves a value out of the sequence, moves a number items by one step, and then moves the first value back into the sequence at the appropriate positionp  precode          typename iteratortraitsltRandomAccessIteratorgtvaluetype             val  GLIBCXXMOVEi           GLIBCXXMOVEBACKWARD3first, i, i  1           first  GLIBCXXMOVEval codepre  pstrongDo you know of a standard sorting implementation which doesnt require a value type but can operate with swaps alonestrongp  pSo Id not only need my class which serves as a reference, but I would also need a class to hold a temporary value. And as the size of my objects is dynamic, Id have to allocate that on the heap, which means memory allocations at the very leafs of the recusrion tree. Perhaps one alternative would be a vaue type with a static size that should be large enough to hold objects of the sizes I currently intend to support. But that would mean that there would be even more hackery in the relation between the codereferencetypecode and the codevaluetypecode of the iterator class. And it would mean I would have to update that size for my application to one day support larger objects. Ugly.p  pstrongIf you can think of a clean way to get the above code to manipulate my data without having to allocate memory dynamically, that would be a great solution.strong Im using C11 features already, so using move semantics or similar wont be a problem.p  h24. Custom sortingh2  pI even considered reimplementing all of quicksort. Perhaps I could make use of the fact that my comparison is mostly a lexicographical compare, i.e. I could sort sequences by first byte and only switch to the next byte when the firt byte is the same for all elements. I havent worked out the details on this yet, but strongif anyone can suggest a reference, an implementation or even a canonical name to be used as a keyword for such a bytewise lexicographical sorting, Id be very happy.strong Im still not convinced that with reasonable effort on my part I could beat the performance of the STL template implementation.p  h25. Completely different algorithmh2  pI know there are emmany manyem kinds of sorting algorithms out there. Some of them might be better suited to my problem. emRadix sortem comes to my mind first, but I havent really thought this through yet. strongIf you can suggest a sorting algorithm more suited to my problem, please do so. Preferrably with implementation, but even without.strongp  h1Questionh1  pSo basically my question is thisbr strongHow would you efficiently sort objects of dynamic size in heap memorystrongp  pAny answer to this question which is applicable to my situation is good, no matter whether it is related to my own ideas or not. Answers to the individual questions marked in bold, or any other insight which might help me decide between my alternatives, would be useful as well, particularly if no definite answer to a single approach turns up.p

Negative 382 pIm trying to put up a simple but portable way to use shared memory. codeBoostinterprocesscode seemed like a good place to start, but I ran into some problemsconcerns.p  ol liCan I somehow query existence of shm segment, preferably using boost API I could always try to create it using codecreateonlycode and catch an exception, but thats bad design, I dont want stack unwinding in the good path.li liCan I truncate the segment even while other processes are attached provided Ill handle the synchronization, ofcourse I suppose all the other processes would have to remap, would they also have to reattachli liBoost doc says that on windows the portable codesharedmemoryobjectcode isnt actually shared memory per se, but rather a memorymapped file.

Negative 382 pIm kind of a beginner with both C and the intricacies of serial communication.  Ill try to provide all the information about this issue that i can let me know if theres anything additional I should provide that would help.p  pIm in the process of porting the communication protocol for a serial device a micromanipulator from C to Python, for use in a Python application my lab is developing.  The company has provided us with the source code for a small command line utility used to interface with the device.  Using this logic, our Python module is able to to generate correctidentical data blocks, including the CRC.  However, when a data block identical to a data block generated by the C code is sent by the Python code, it receives no response from the device.  Using a serial port monitoring program Free Serial Port Monitor, Ive noticed that the communications between Python and the device differ in some cases from the utility provided by the company.  p  pHeres a screenshot of the log for the provided utility, which works properly.  It shows the sending of one data block and its response, as well the sending of a second data block and the start of the response.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgQ7lV.png altLog Example from utilityp  pAnd heres a screenshot of what happens with our Python code as you can see it sends the data block with no response.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcfrcZ.png altLog example from pythonp  pAs for other info that might be useful, Im using the standard Python serial libraries.  The structure of the data block is 14 ASCII characters, starting with STX and ending with ETX.  The first eight data characters correspond to functions, addresses, values, etc., while the final four characters are the CRC.p  pAs I said, Im a bit of a noob at this and I really have no idea where to start.  Any advice or assistance, or resources that might help me figure this out would be greatly appreciated, and let me know if theres any more specific info I should providep  pa hrefhttpreentry.mit.eduextserialport.c relnofollowhttpreentry.mit.eduextserialport.cap  pa hrefhttpreentry.mit.eduextserialport.h relnofollowhttpreentry.mit.eduextserialport.hap

Negative 382 pI am writing a bash script that runs a C program multiple times. I use codegetenvcode and codeputenvcode to create, get, and update environment variables in the C program.  After the C program ends, the bash script needs to grab these variables and perform some basic logic.  The problem is that when the C program exits, the environment variables disappear.  Is there any way to permanently store these variables after the programs termination so that the bash script can use them  If not, what is the best way to share variables between a bash script and a C program  The only solution I can think of is writing output to files.  I do not want to print this data in the console.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

I can add a new codefieldidcode at any time to add a new fieldfeature to my app instead of doing a schema update to add yet another column to a wide logbook table.p  pSo what Im wondering, is there a way I can have a single ActiveRecord model in which I can reference all 5 of these tablesp

Negative 382 pI have a stickynote which is added directly into the body of the html page. There is also a CSS portion that lets the stickynotes get a little bigger when one hovers over them. p  pAlso, the stickynote is supposed to be rotated via CSS. Additionally I have some javascript code that is supposed to save the position of the stickynote before the window unloads and then retrieve the stickynote and put it in the same position in which it was before the window was unloaded. However, a problem occurs with the rotated stickynotes, so that when the stickynotes are retrieved and put back into the body their position is slightly off from the position they had before refreshing the page.this does not happen when the stickynotes are not rotatedp  pIn order to fix that I contained each stickynote into its own stickyContainer div, which is not rotated, so that the correct positon of the stickycontainer could be retrieved after the unload event. p  phtmlp  precodeltdiv classstickyContainer styleleft20pxtop70pxgt     ltdiv classstickyNotegt         lth1gtDrag Melth1gt         ltpgtLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.

Negative 382 pJohnny cache is good for table of readonly data or seldom updated data, like game meta table. It got table level versioning which will auto expire query cache on the target table if an update happens on it.p  pFor an SNS like application, UGC can usually be sharded by userid and cache are usually done on peruser level, so Im thinking of change the autoversioning mechanism from table level to a user level, for example, for table level, a key conceptually would look like p  blockquote   pjc  table name  table version  query hashp blockquote  pfor a user level key it would likep  blockquote   pjc  table name  table  userid  version  query hashp blockquote  pwhich is imagining that the cache is done on a view of the table for a specific user considering the view of select  from table where userid111 as the table for johnnycache to work on.

Negative 382 pI am having a field  codeexpiryLimitcode in my codeItemcode entity for which I thought of using emjodatimeem codePeriodcode which would be an appropriate type to use here. p  pJust to explain  codeexpiryLimitcode is the number of emyearem, emmonthem, emdaysem, or any duration after which a particular emitemem will expire and using which I can calculate the exact codeexpiryDatecode of an codeItemcode given a codedeliveryDatecode. p  pNow the problem Im facing is finding an appropriate way to map this type into codeJPAcode.p  pIs there any available emAPIem or em3rd party libraryem which provides some annotation to do that Also Ive used the emEclipse Linkem codeConvertercode annotation to map codeDateTimecode with emMySQLem codeTimeStampcode. So, would I need to do the same thing with codePeriodcode also. And if yes, then to what type should I convert it. To codevarcharcode or to codeLongcode or some other type appropriate to represent a codePeriodcode.p

Negative 382 pI want an infinite nonstrict series xsub1sub, xsub2sub, xsub3sub... that I can work with one element at a time, not memoizing the results in order to keep my memory usage constant. For the sake of specificity lets say its a series of integers e.g. the natural numbers, the odd numbers, the primes, though this question might apply to more general data types.p  pThe easiest way to work with infinite lists is to use Scalas codeStreamcode object. A common idiom is to write a function that returns a codeStreamcode, uses the codecode operator to add a term to the series, and then calls itself recursively. For example, the following generates an infinite stream of integers given a starting value and a successor function.p  precode  def infiniteListn Int, f Int gt Int Stream[Int]         n  infiniteListfn, f      infiniteList2, 23.take10 print    returns 2, 7, 17, 37, 77, 157, 317, 637, 1277, 2557, empty codepre  pI realize that the above is equivalent to the library call codeStream.iterate223code. I wrote it here as example of this infinite codeStreamcode idiom.p  pHowever, streams memoize their results, making their memory requirements nonconstant, and potentially very large. The a hrefhttpwww.scalalang.orgapicurrentindex.htmlscala.collection.immutable.Streamdocumentation statesa that memoization is avoided if you dont hold on to the head of a codeStreamcode, but in practice this can be tricky. I may implement infinite list code in which I dont emthinkem Im holding on to any stream heads, but if it still has unbounded memory requirements I have to figure out if the problem is that Im handling my streams in some way that does cause memoization, or if it is something else. This can be a difficult debugging task and has code smell because Im trying to trick an explicitly memoized data structure into returning a nonmemoized result.p  pWhat I want is something with the semantics of codeStreamcode expect without memoization. It doesnt appear that such an object exists in Scala. Ive been experimenting with using iterators to implement infinite numeric series, but the mutability of iterators makes this tricky when you start wanting to do comprehension operations on them. Ive also tried to write my own code from scratch, but its not clear where I should start do I subclass codeTraversablecode or how to avoid reimplementing the functionality in codemapcode, codefoldcode, etc.p  pDoes someone have good example Scala code of an implementation of a nonstrict, immutable, nonmemoized infinite listp  pMore generally, I understand the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8569489semanticsofscalatraversableiterablesequencestreamandviewsemantics of traversable, iterable, sequence, stream, and viewa, but the fact that I find this question so vexing makes me feel like Im misunderstanding something. It seems to me that nonstrictness and nonmemoization are completely orthogonal properties, but Scala seems to have made a design decision to unify them in codeStreamcode and given no easy way to peel them apart. Is this an oversight on Scalas part, or is there some deep connection between nonstrictness and nonmemoization that I am overlookingp  hr  pI realize the question is fairly abstract. Here is some additional context that ties it to a specific problem.p  pI am encountering this issue in the course of implementing a prime number generator as described in Meissa ONiells paper a hrefhttpwww.cs.hmc.eduoneillpapersSieveJFP.pdfThe Genuine Sieve of Eratosthenesa, and its difficult to give a simple example of where an codeIteratorcode object is inadequate without pulling in a lot of the details from that paper. Here is a complete implementation using  a hrefhttpsgithub.comwpmPrimeNumberGeneratorstreamsa that is very elegant but has suspiciously large memory consumption.p  pHere is a simplified implementation with iterators that does not compile but gives you an idea of what I want.p  precodeimport scala.collection.mutable  object ONeillSieve     class NumericSeries extends BufferedIterator[Int] with Ordered[NumericSeries]      def hasNext  true      def comparethat NumericSeries  that.head.comparehead      override def toString  head  ...      var head  3      def next         val r  head       head  2       r        def mainargs Array[String]      val q  mutable.PriorityQueue[NumericSeries]      val odds  new NumericSeries      q  odds.mapodds.head       odds.next     q  odds.mapodds.head        printlnSieve  snInput  s.formatq, odds     codepre  pI need to build a codePriorityQueuecode of infinite numeric series keyed by their smallest element. Hence I use a codeBufferedIteratorcode instead of just a plain codeIteratorcode. Also note that here the basis for infinite series is the odd integers but the most general solution involves more complicated series. At the end of the main function I want the queue to contain two infinite seriesp  ol li3xodds starting from 3 i.e. 9,12,15...li li5xodds starting from 5 i.e. 25,30,35...li ol  pThe above does not compile because codeodds.map...code returns an codeIteratorcode, not a codeNumericSeriescode and hence cannot be added to the priority queue.p  pAt this point it looks like Im wading into collections classes extensions, and thats tricky so I want to make sure Im not having to do it unless absolutely necessary.p

Negative 382 pI have a simple table view with 1 section and 2 rows. Im using a codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode to keep the table syncd with CoreData. I make a change to one of the rows in CD which triggers a table view cell to be updated and moved. The problem is that when codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode gets called during the codeNSFetchedResultsChangeUpdatecode, the wrong cell is returned this makes sense bc the cells havent been moved yet. So the wrong cell is updated with with the newly updated data. After that the codeNSFetchedResultsChangeMovecode message is handled so the cells trade places neither cells content is updated since its just a move call. The result is both cells reflect the data from the newly updated CD entity. Reloading the table fixes the issue. Im running iOS 6. In other words if the cell at index 0 represents entity A and index 1 represents entity B and I update entity A to A in such a way that the 2 cells reverse order, the result is that I see 0A 1A when I would expect 0B, 1A.p  precode voidcontrollerNSFetchedResultsController controller didChangeObjectidanObject atIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath forChangeTypeNSFetchedResultsChangeTypetype newIndexPathNSIndexPath newIndexPath       UITableView tableView  self.tableView      switchtype           case NSFetchedResultsChangeInsert             [tableView insertRowsAtIndexPaths[NSArray arrayWithObjectnewIndexPath] withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationFade]             break          case NSFetchedResultsChangeDelete             [tableView deleteRowsAtIndexPaths[NSArray arrayWithObjectindexPath] withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationFade]             break          case NSFetchedResultsChangeUpdate the wrong cell is updated here             [self configureCellSyncCell[tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath] atIndexPathindexPath]             break          case NSFetchedResultsChangeMove             [tableView moveRowAtIndexPathindexPath toIndexPathnewIndexPath] this code produces errors too             [tableView deleteRowsAtIndexPaths[NSArray arrayWithObjectindexPath] withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationFade]             [tableView insertRowsAtIndexPaths[NSArray arrayWithObjectnewIndexPath] withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationFade]             break       codepre

Negative 382 pI am building a Windows 8 Pro application and I would like the application to enter Suspend state immediately after losing focus or being minimizedp  pThis is for a kiosk application wont actually be on the Store where I want to relaunchrefocus the application when a user tries to hide it. So far, I can only refocus it using a native C app once the app has been killed i.e. when the process does not exist in Process.GetProcessByName. This is why I would like to kill the application the user should not be minimizing it so killing it is a cost the application can bear.p  pHow can I get the application to terminate when it is minimized I am wondering if it is possible to set the timeout period, or to intercept a general event in App.xaml.cs when the application itself has lost focus then perhaps call App.Exit terminate the process. I have tried the Application.Suspending event but takes too long to fire off. It takes about 10 seconds to fire off AFTER the application has been killed with ALTF4.p

Negative 382 pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions749911howcanileakmemoryinclojurethis SO threada, I learned that keeping a reference to a codeseqcode on a large collection will prevent the entire collection from being garbagecollected.p  pFirst, that thread is from 2009.  Is this still true in modern Clojure v1.4.0 or v1.5.0p  pSecond, does this issue also apply to lazy sequences  For example, would codedef s drop 999 seq range 1000code allow the garbage collector to retire the first code999code elements of the sequencep  pLastly, is there a good way around this issue for large collections  In other words, if I had a vector of, say, 10 million elements, could I consume the vector in such a way that the consumed parts could be garbage collected  What about if I had a hashmap with 10 million elementsp  pThe reason I ask is that Im operating on fairly large data sets, and I am having to be more careful not to retain references to objects, so that the objects I dont need can be garbage collected.  As it is, Im encountering a codejava.lang.OutOfMemoryError GC overhead limit exceededcode error in some cases.p

Negative 382 pIm experiencing unusual behavior on an iPad in iOS 6.1.2 when using a UITabBarController with a UISplitViewController which has a UITableViewController for the master view controller.  If I have multiple tabs, of which at least one tab contains a split view controller, and I am in landscape mode while viewing the tab that contains the split view controller, then I switch to another tab, then move to portrait mode, then press the tab that contains the split view controller, what happens next is that the master view controller a table view controller will display the table view over top of the detail view, when it is clearly not supposed to be there.  This behavior happens only the first time the app is loaded, but is consistent behavior.p  pThis scenario is easy to recreate by simply creating a project that is a split view application that uses an iPad device and Core Data didnt try it without using Core Data.  After the project is created, use the storyboard and add a tab bar controller and make it the initial view controller, then add a view controller seque from the tab bar controller to the split view controller.  After that, only one change is necessary in code which is to change the one line in applicationdidfinishLaunchingWithOptions in the AppDelegate.mp  pChange the following template codep  precodeUISplitViewController splitViewController  UISplitViewController self.window.rootViewController codepre  pTop  precodeUITabBarController tbc  UITabBarController self.window.rootViewController UISplitViewController splitViewController  [tbc.viewControllers lastObject] codepre  pPerhaps Im breaking some iOS rules, and trying to do something Im not supposed to  All I want to do is to be able to tab between a few different split view controllers.

Negative 382 pIf I have an SVG element that extends beyond the size of the SVG, I get scroll bars in my browser.  I want to stretch the SVG control to be the size of the visible region and I dont want elements that are partially visible to cause scroll bars to appear on the page.p  pIve distilled this down to a simple example.

However, when you open this in your browser you will see a scroll bar because the rectangle extends out past the end of the SVG element and off the page.p  pHow do I get rid of the scroll bars  Essentially Id like to crop the SVG to the clip path.p  pUpdate This seems to only be a problem in IE.  Firefox and Chrome render it the way I like it.p

Negative 382 pI am using a QWebView and call to setHtml to display some HTMLJavaScript pages.  I am passing data updates using QWebFrameevaluateJavaScript by passing it a QString containing a call to a JavaScript function with arguments.  After reading about the Qt WebKit Bridge I  feel like there should be a better way to do his.  I see discussion of exposing Qt objects  functions in C to the JavaScript, but not the other direction. I do not want the JavaScript to poll the C side for updates.  Is there a way to connect a JavaScript function as a slot to a QtC signal Or a similar pattern I feel like I have looked through a lot of docs, posted questions even the Similar Questions as I type this, but have not seen examples of this.  Appreciate any info, links or nudges in the right direction.p

It basically checks if       the fragments exist and if they do, well hide them. If the fragments       dont exist, we create them, add them to the FragmentManager and hide       them.           private void setupFragments          final FragmentTransaction ft  getSupportFragmentManager.beginTransaction                     If the activity is killed while in BG, its possible that the           fragment still remains in the FragmentManager, so, we dont need to           add it again.                   mMapFragment  MapFragment getSupportFragmentManager.findFragmentByTagMapFragment.TAG         if mMapFragment  null              mMapFragment  new MapFragment             ft.addR.id.fragmentcontainer, mMapFragment, MapFragment.TAG                  ft.hidemMapFragment          mMyListFragment  MyListFragment getSupportFragmentManager.findFragmentByTagMyListFragment.TAG         if mMyListFragment  null              mMyListFragment  new MyListFragment             ft.addR.id.fragmentcontainer, mMyListFragment, MyListFragment.TAG                  ft.hidemMyListFragment          ft.commit                  This method shows the given Fragment and if there was another visible       fragment, it gets hidden. We can just do this because we know that both       the mMyListFragment and the mMapFragment were added in the Activitys       onCreate, so we just create the fragments once at first and not every       time.

Negative 382 pIm using a vanilla WCF DataService class exposing a simple Entity Framework Model. The service is contained in a simple Web Application published to IIS. Nothing fancy, rightp  pIm trying to build what MSDN describes this wayp  blockquote   pstrongRequest and Application Scopestrongbr   Instances of parts created in an MVC app   exist in one of two scopes the request scope or the application   scope. By default, part instances that are created during a web   request are in a request scope. Instances of parts that are in the   same request are shared, so if more than one part imports a given   part, all importers receive a reference to the same instance. Each web   request has its own scope, so parts created in one request are never   used to fill imports in another request. When a request ends, its   associated scope is destroyed and any parts created for it are   destroyed. Parts that implement an IDisposable object are disposed.   This ensures that sensitive resources, such as database connections,   are properly closed. Sometimes, you might not want to create a part   instance for each request for example, when you implement an appwide   cache. In these cases, you can force a part to be created in the   application scope by applying the ApplicationScoped attribute. Parts   in the application scope are always shared by all requests in the app.   A part in the application scope may depend on other part in the   application scope only for its imports. Parts in the application scope   must be careful to be threadsafe.p blockquote  pOne of the main problems is that I dont know where to create the RequestScope Container. I think the RequestScope Container should be build outside of the DataService class, rightp  pAny help appredicatedp

Negative 382 pWe have moved our .NET web app deployment to Microsoft WebDeploy 3.0, and the transition has gone really well.p  pWe are able to quickly and simply deploy to dev, test, and soon, production. But wed like to add an extra level of restriction for deployment to production. Partially for security, but mostly to avoid oops, no I didnt. moments.p  pThe user accounts that deploy to dev and test are domain admins. Is there a way to restrict who has access to connect to the WebDeploy service or who can publish Id like to remove Domain Admins from production WebDeploy, and add a deployment account used exclusively for this. But Domain Admins will still need pretty liberal access to the server, Id just like to restrict them in WebDeploy.p  p[This seems to be a different question than most are asking, which is how to allow addtional, nonadmin users access. Id like to know how to strongdisallowstrong admins access.]p
Negative 382 pIm currently learning about different ways to emulate class inheritance C style using Javascript. Specifically I have been trying to create two object classes constructors contained within immediatelyinvoked functions, as in the Module design pattern, the second of which uses the first class as its prototype object.p  pIn the example, I have a Vehicle classp  precode Prototype object var Vehicle  function      var Constructor  function         var type  Vehicle          this.GetType  function             return type                    return Constructor  codepre  pNext I have a Car classp  precode Constructor based on prototype var Car  function      var Constructor  function name, make            Inerit the prototype class         this.proto  new Vehicle           Private         var name  name         var make  make           Privileged         this.GetName  function             return name                  this.GetMake  function             return make                    return Constructor  codepre  pIn the Car constructor, I set the prototype to a new instance of Vehicle. To test whether all this is working, I am using the following jQueryp  precode document.ready function      var myCar  new Car betsy, Lexus       alert GetType   myCar.GetType   GetName   myCar.GetName   GetMake   myCar.GetMake   codepre  pThis all works fine. When I open the page, the dialog appears, and confirms that myCar.GetType returns Vehicle as it should. p  pI have also been reading up on the revealing module pattern, which so far I have found very useful due to its clarity. However, if I try to replace the Vehicle and Car classes shown above with the followingp  precode Prototype object var Vehicle  function      var Constructor  function         var type  Vehicle          var getType  function             return type                   return             GetType getType                    return Constructor    Constructor based on prototype var Car  function      var Constructor  function name, make            Inerit the prototype class         this.proto  new Vehicle           Private         var name  name         var make  make          var getName  function             return name                  var getMake  function             return make                   return              GetName getName,             GetMake getMake                    return Constructor  codepre  pSuddenly, it refuses to work. Now as far as I can tell with my existing JS knowledge, the new classes do exactly the same as the old ones, the difference being that the member functions are created locally and exposed to public scope in the returned object literal this method of creating classes has worked fine in my previous experiments. I dont understand where the difference lies. Im still trying to get used to many of the stranger concepts in JS strange compared to C at least.... Can anyone please explain or clarify this problem for me Other commentssuggestions about my methodology are also welcome bound to be some bad practices in there somewhere.p  pThanks all p
Negative 382 pIm fairly new to Access, but I have never had anything like this happen to me. p  pI have an Access DB that I am creating, and I have been using recordsets to grab values for variables.

Ive tried saving it to a new location, but it still errors out as soon as I enter in a new recordset. Waiting it out doesnt seem to work either.p  pNow I have no idea what to do. Any help that can be provided would be immensely appreciated. This is driving me insane. p  pEDIT IN Creating a new recordset in this method codeDim rs2 AS ADODB.Recordsetcode causes a crash as well.p  pEDIT 2 It appears to specific to just this class. Is it impossible to use both ADODB and a DAO in the same class I just added a DAO recordset to my project. Perhaps thats causing the problem. Commenting out the DAO recordset creation doesnt stop Access from crashing.p

Negative 382 pI have a WCF service that implements custom error handling by implementing the IErrorHandler interface.p  pNow, if a client sends a request with an invalid XML structure the serializer will throw an InvalidOperationException and we end up in the custom error handler. However, an InvalidOperationException seems like a pretty general exception to me and Im worried that the server might throw such an exception while processing the request should only happen in truly exceptional cases, but some weird state might produce such an exception.p  pThese are two different errors and should result in two different StatusCodes set to the response. How can I reliably identify the source of an exception so that I can set the proper StatusCode in my custom error handlerp

Negative 382 pI am a beginner in programming though I am quite comfortable with cc. As a part of a project that I have decided to do for fun, I am supposed to build a program for storing and handling huge integers. I know that there are many answers out there but I need ideas that I can implement easily, bearing in mind that I can use any of the basic concepts of CC.p  pHow should I go about itp  pThis is the first time I am asking a question here so please correct me if I am wrong about anything. Thanks.p  pEdit Actually what I wanted to know was how should I go about storing a huge integer... Obviously an array is what comes to mind at first glance but are there any other methods out there at the basic levelp  hr  h2EDIT2 I came across a very nice solution to this problem a while ago, but was just a bit lazy to put it on here. We can use the concept of number systems to deal with huge numbers. We can declare an array that holds the coefficient of powers of 256, thus obtaining a base 256 system. We can then use fundamental concepts like those of the  various number systems to obtain our required results. Thanks a lot anyways.h2

I tried changing the uri to codeContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phonecode but it didnt work.p  pThen i modified the getitem method as followsp  precodeOverride public Object getItemint position      Cursor cursor  Cursor super.getItemposition     Contact contact  new Contact      String imageUri  cursor             .getStringContactsQuery.PHOTOTHUMBNAILDATACOLUMN     Bitmap bitmap  loadContactPhotoThumbnailimageUri,             mDropdownItemHeight     if bitmap  null          bitmap  mLoadingImage           contact.id  cursor.getLongContactsQuery.IDCOLUMN      Cursor phones  mContext.getContentResolver.query             ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.CONTENTURI,             null,             ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.CONTACTID                          contact.id, null, null     while phones.moveToNext          String phoneNumber  phones                 .getStringphones                         .getColumnIndexContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.NUMBER         Log.dTAG, Number   phoneNumber           contact.lookupKey  cursor             .getStringContactsQuery.LOOKUPKEYCOLUMN     contact.displayName  cursor             .getStringContactsQuery.DISPLAYNAMECOLUMN     contact.image  bitmap      return contact   codepre  pThis gives me the contact number, but the query still happens in the UI thread i guess. I want it to happen in background thread. How do i achieve this.p  pPlease also tell if there is an alternate approach.p
Negative 382 pWe are experiencing this strange issue with one of our ClickOncedeployed applicationsp  pOn some client machines, ClickOnce when updating the application does not copy the old database in the .pre folder.p  pClickOnce updates the application, but it behaves like it is a new installation.p  pAnother strange thing is that despite it is specified a minimum required version to force any client to update the client PCs which have this issue display the ClickOnce upgrade prompt it also displays the Restore the application to its previous state in the control panel Program and features item.p  pIndeed, other client PCs upgrade automatically without prompting and ClickOnce update behaves like it should.p  pThis is a mature application and this is our 30th publication.p  pAnother element is Usually we published this application alternatively with two PCs a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13073915clickonceprerequisiteerrorpublishedinstallermaybecorruptbut after installing VisualnbspStudionbsp2012 we cannot use them to publish ClickOncea and then we create a virtual machine only for publishing this application.p  pUPDATEp  pI accepted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers160671robindotnetRobinDotNetas solution because it is DAMN RIGHT to not rely on ClickOnce moving your data reliably.p  pI also found that you cannot rely on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.deployment.application.applicationdeployment.isfirstrun.aspx relnofollowApplicationDeployment.IsFirstRuna.p  pI changed my code to use my internal check for IsFirstRun and now every updates run smoothly.p

Negative 382 pI am using the package bigmemory to interact with large matrices in R.

Negative 382 pIm writing a function that UNINTENTIONALLY seems to work differently depending on how it is invoked. The function should do the following ACCEPT 2 parameters, a string and an integer Return 1 string of variable length that might be any length from 1 to several thousand characters.p  pIf the string is null, the function returns a string of spaces equal to the integer param. If the string is shorter than the length, it will pad the string to the desired length. If the string is longer than the length, it will return a cropped string. If the string is the correct length, it will return the string.p  pThe input string and the output string should work for any string variable, regardless of length.  p  precodeUSE [mydb] GO SET ANSINULLS ON GO SET QUOTEDIDENTIFIER ON GO ALTER FUNCTION [dbo].[fixlen]      v varcharmax,     lenv int  RETURNS varcharmax AS BEGIN      Declare the return variable here     DECLARE curlen as int     DECLARE retval as varcharmax      set retval  ISNULLv, spacelenv     set curlen  dataLENgthretval      set retval  case when curlen lt lenv then retval  SPACElenvcurlen                         when curlen gt lenv then SUBSTRINGretval,1, lenv                         else retval                    end      RETURN retval  END codepre  pNow heres the problem.  IF I invoke this function like thisp  pSELECT dbo.fixlena, 10  dbo.fixlenb, 10  dbo.fixlenc, 10  dbo.fixlend, 10 from sometable p  pTHEN it the fixlen function works JUST FINEp  pHowever, if I invoke it like this SELECT dbo.fixlena, 10, dbo.fixlenb, 10, dbo.fixlenc, 10, dbo.fixlend, 10 from sometable p  pTHEN it the fixlen function or maybe sql server wants to pad each field out to max chars.p  pThe current purpose of this for me at the current time is to create a text file that concatenates the fields together.  I invoke a stored procedure through the bcp command in the cmd shell.  It works fine, IF I MANUALLY CONCATENATE THE STRINGS MYSELF as in the first select.p  pHowever, if I let BCP figure it out, it pads each field out.  But I dont think BCP is the problem.  If I just execute each of the two selects from a query window, the first select is right  the second adds the padding.p  pAny ideas what Im doing wrong  and just as importantly, what I can do to fix itp

Negative 382 pI am creating a game using cocos2dx 2.1.4. Its FPS drops continuously , and never recover. Please find the details as followsp  pBackground about the way I am doing things Its game about scrolling down some shapes, each shape is made up of some square blocks.I have 7 kind of blocks. All loaded in a Sprite Sheet and using these blocks from this sprite sheet I create a shape. A level file is consist of these shapes. I load two levels at the same time one onscreen and another off screen to make it seamless scrolling.

Also if I play game very fast the peak of time increases  in track, that should be fine as I am giving more work to do, but once a peak is attained it remains approximately at that height only, even if I leave the game Idle. Is it normal  According to me it should have returned to its normal peak once the current work is done.p  p2 Some where I thought its happening because I used two batch nodes and removing its children on a user touch immediately might causing it slow but then after removing the children it should run normal. to give an idea is it ok to remove 10 children from batch node immediately  some guys say its very slow process. Just to check if this causing problem , I did p  pInstead of removing them I just set visibility of the children to false.But still FPS drops and never recovers.p  pPlease share your thoughts on this.p

Negative 382 pIm attempting to write an AI for a Pokemon like game except all moves are known by both players before hand everything is visible to both players. Ive recorded all the information Im going to need such as damage, accuracy, critical chance, etc.p  pI thought I would be aiming towards an Expectiminimax known algorithm solution which seemed reasonable but Ive hit a snag How to handle ordering of who goes first. Sure, its based on the speed of the current player and whoever is faster starts but some moves gain a priority and end up going first despite their speed.p  pAn example would be that my opponent who is faster uses a really strong ability but I use a block which takes priority and negates his ability outright. I cant pretend he goes first anymore as my move will cancel his out.p  pPerhaps Im simply overthinking this but its becoming a real problem when I try to write out my Expectiminimax on paper.p

Negative 382 pSo I have my code below. Im trying to the order the mutable array in terms of score. I have assigned the score in a dictionary for the title of each pub. But when Im calling the keyssortedbyvalue its sorting them fine. As seen by the Logs Below but for some reason this change isnt being reflected in the variable sortedPubArray outside the block. Any ideas whyp  pNOTE I have created a separate variable for sortedPubArray so its easier to see its not being reflected in the variable outside of the block.p  precodeMethod to get us the pubs for a specific user NSMutableArray PubsForUserPFUser passedUser  First things first lets create our array to represent the array of pubs which should be returned when our query finally executes down there somewhere block NSMutableArray pubArray  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init] And the sorted version, which we will ultimately return block NSMutableArray sortedPubArray  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]  Get the user passed in so we can get there preferences PFUser currentUser  passedUser Get all the keys into a local array so we can traverse through and find out what user likes NSMutableArray allTypes  [NSMutableArray arrayWithArray[currentUser allKeys]] first we have to remove the username and email keys from the array [allTypes removeObjectusername] [allTypes removeObjectemail]  NSMutableArray userTypes  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]  Now traverse through array and if the type is set to true add it to our local userTypes array For each category in the user for NSString typeKey in allTypes      If the user has selected this category as one of their choices     if [currentUser[typeKey]  isEqual YES]          Then add the category name ie the key to our local property representing the users choosen style of pubs         [userTypes addObjecttypeKey]        Create our array of queries NSMutableArray queryArray  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]  Traverse through our array of user categories and create a query for each one. for NSString style in userTypes       Set up Parse query     PFQuery pubQuery  [PFQuery queryWithClassNamePub]     [pubQuery whereKeystyle equalToYES]      Add query to array of queries     [queryArray addObjectpubQuery]      Now create final query which will contain each of our subqueries PFQuery totalQuery  [PFQuery orQueryWithSubqueriesqueryArray] [totalQuery findObjectsInBackgroundWithBlockNSArray objects, NSError error      Do error checking     if error          Log out error message to user         UIAlertView queryErrorAlert  [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitleWhoops messageHouston theres a problem Try again in 5 minutes or drop us an email if this keeps happening at gordonouterapp.com delegateself cancelButtonTitleOK otherButtonTitlesnil]         [queryErrorAlert show]      It worked     else          So now we have an array of PFObjects ie Pubs         [pubArray addObjectsFromArrayobjects]          Now sort the array by number of hits, ie number of categories the same. So that the pubclub most tailored to the users tastes is top of the array          First create array to contain all pub categories so were not comparing users restaurant categories with the pub this could crash the app as you can see below, wed be trying toaccessing properties of the pub which dont exist         NSMutableArray pubTypes  [NSMutableArray arrayWithArray[[objects objectAtIndex0] allKeys]]         And set up a dictionary to keep the score of each pub score is how many of the same types it has as user         NSMutableDictionary pubScores  [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init]           This requires us to iterate through the array assinging a value to the variable representing the likeness of the pub to the user. So the higher the score, the more hits         for PFObject pub in pubArray               int pubScore  0              So now we should calculate the total score, by iterating through and adding 1 each time its true             for NSString category in pubTypes                   Test if the pub and the users category choice is the same. ie this will iterate through student, theme, gastropub etc and everytime they are the same we add 1, and different 1                 if pub[category]  currentUser[category]                      Theyre the same so add to the score                     pubScore                   If theyre not the same                 else                       Subtract one                     pubScore                                             Now store the score of the pub in our dictionary             [pubScores setValue[NSNumber numberWithIntpubScore] forKey[pub objectForKeyPubName]]                     And now finally simply sort the array by score the first with the highest score, so that the pub with the best rating is at the top of the feed         To do this, we can use an inbuilt NSMutableDictionary method to output our keys in descending order of magnitude         sortedPubArray  [NSMutableArray arrayWithArray[pubScores keysSortedByValueUsingComparatorNSComparisonResultid obj1, id obj2               If its greater, put it above             if [obj1 integerValue] gt [obj2 integerValue]                 return NSComparisonResultNSOrderedAscending             If lower, then below             if [obj1 integerValue] lt [obj2 integerValue]                 return NSComparisonResultNSOrderedDescending              return NSComparisonResultNSOrderedSame          ]]          NSLogFinishedBlockLog , sortedPubArray      ]  NSLogFinishedMethodLog , sortedPubArray return pubArray  codepre  pLogsp  p20131109 163527.722 Outer[503770b] FinishedMethodLog  p  p20131109 163527.723 Outer[503770b] Variable assigned to the return of the method  p  p20131109 163527.925 Outer[503770b] FinishedBlockLog      TestPub,     Waxy OConnors,     The Ark,     The Counting House,     Radio p  p20131109 163532.590 Outer[503770b] Button Ive created to log out variable which has the return of the method assigned to it  p  pSo we can see that when the block is finished, and Im logging out sortedPubArray when that happens, it still isnt reflected in sortedPubArray outside of the block.

Negative 382 pIve been encountering a strange problem for the last weeks.p  pIm maintaining a TYPO3 4.5 LTS based website which can be accessed with or without SSL connection except some special pages with forms etc, which are only available via https.

Sorting on a single column is easy I can just create a csindex for the column I want to sort on and then use the Table.itersorted to get the rows in sorted order, which I insert into a new table, row by row.p  pThe problem is that I want to sort a table on emtwoem columns. p  pThe table is in the following formp  precodechr   start   end      chr1  1000    2000 chr1  1500    3000 chr2  1000    5000 chr2  1200    2000 codepre  pIn this example the order is correct, i.e. first its sorted on chr, then on start. Is it possible to achieve this twocolumn sorting in an elegant way p  pP.S. I know that I can sort by extracting the columns, and then sort the numpy arrays inmemory by using numpy.lexsort, but the data I am working may sometimes be too large possibly billions of rows...p
Negative 382 pIs there a way to configure in which way different Aspects or their corresponding Advisors to be more precise in Spring are initialized Note that I am not talking about the advice order, but the initialization of the aspects.p  pThe background of this question is a use case with codeAspect Acode dependent on codeService Xcode which should be advised by codeAspect Bcode. However, as codeAspect Acode gets initialized first and enforces the creation of codeService Xcode, codeAspect Bcode is not applied to the service.p  pHow can I change the initialization order without making codeService Xcode dependent on codeAspect Bcode this would be a workaround as it enforces the desired order, but a service should never have to deal with its aspects...p  pIf you want the big picture of my issue, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21512791springservicewithcacheablemethodsgetsinitializedwithoutcachewhenautowihere is another question which led me to asking this one.ap

Negative 382 pI am trying to create a webpage including an iframe where the iframe has customizable content. Its an API project. My main issue is not how to manage appending content to an iframe using jQuery, but in this case I have an empty iframe where I want to insert a full webpage into it. The code for the webpage going into the iframe is received using a .post function where I in return get the full webpage in the data variable.  I cant manage to insert the full code, which include local javascript with important javascript libraries. It is as if it doesnt execute the code inside the iframe. The code is inserted but all the main htmlbody etc tags are deleted from the code passed in data variable, which prevents various javascript code from working. I have of course checked that the page received in data variable is ALL of the code. It is correct. The missing tags are missing when displayed in the iframe.p  pparent page, domain unknown to me as a API providerp  precodeltbodygt ltiframe idEMSNLframe srcdoc seamlessgtltiframegt  ltscriptgt EMSNLframe.loadfunction   .posthttpsapi.educationalmedia.seAPIdisplayNTNewsLetterMenu,      ResUID[secret code],   MenuLanguageEnglish,   PDFLanguage  Blank for all languages, or state a language    ,   functiondata,status     EMSNLframe.contents.findhtml.htmldata lt this is the line I need a solution for If there is any.

Negative 382 pI was reading a hrefhttpsweblogs.java.netblogemcmanusarchive20101025usingbuilderpatternsubclassesthisa article, , about subclassing a builder class. I understood the article but there was one small bit that bothered me. There was this method,p  precodepublic static Builderltgt builder          return new Builder2  codepre  pWhen I changed codeBuilderltgtcode to codeBuildercode, a raw type, the compiler would not compile the code. The error was,p  precodeRectangle.java33 error cannot find symbol System.out.printlnRectangle.builder.opacity0.5.height250 codepre  pWhat was the additional information passed to the compiler using the additional codeltgtcode I suspected it was the compiler which could not figure the right instance during compilation.

Negative 382 pSwiftMailer is the default way of sending email from a Symfony 2 project, and Id like to use it in an application.  Ive pointed it towards the SMTP server provided by my internet provider Virgin Media, in the UK, but my emails are not successfully sent.

Tracing execution through the Swiftmailer source, I find that this value comes from domain on AbstractSmtpTransport altering the value during the debug session allows the email to be sent.  Although it can be set using the public setLocalDomain method, it isnt anywhere in the Symfony 2 framework, so it seems that there is no way obvious to me, at least of easily configuring this value simply by, for example, changing a Symfony config file.p  pSo my question is this is there some other way of changing this value, ideally using config, without my diving into the Symfony code and changing bits that arent meant to be changed  And if so, whatp

Negative 382 pbr Im using libcurl c library to make a request to an IIS 7.5 server. The transaction is a common SOAP webservicebrbr Everything is working fine, my requests send an Expect 100continue flag, and the server responds with a 100continue and inmediately after that a 200 ok code along with the web service response.brbr But from time to time, the client receives a 100continue message and after that, another 100 code. This makes the client report an error, as it expects a final status code right after the  server 100 code. I read in W3C HTTP1.1 protocolp  blockquote   pAn origin server that sends a 100 Continue response MUST           ultimately send a final status code, once the request body is           received and processed, unless it terminates the transport           connection prematurely.p blockquote  pThe word ultimately makes me loose the track.

Negative 382 pLets say we have a groovy class with some methods static or not static.

Problem is, i dont know the parameters of each original method so i cant replace the old methods with new methods closures because i cannot create wrapping closures with varying numbers and types of parameters dynamically and even if yi could, i didnt know how to access them inside the wrapping closure.

The structure that I am working with is infinite tree structure that has unknown amount of nodes on each layer, mechanism I am looking for is ability to get siblings on the same level that I am starting search from is and only children of his parent his brothers  himself. All levels of tree have identical HTML syntax, so looking at them relatively from element one starts from, each layer is identical, hence the CSS selector should be identical too. I cannot use any other Jquery method but find, and only can use CSS selectors, as mechanism is part of selenium test so only By.CssSelector... can be used. I can traverse up the elements by using element.FindElementsBy.XPath.. that gets me parent as I know how many levels up parent is, but from parent position I need to get all siblings without children that have identical html syntax in one go, so i would assume selector with only certain layer should do like one in jsfiddle below, however it selects all the children nodes too  does not respect  for some reason. This would do nicely if I could use all JQuery functions.p  precode.sss.parent.parent.children.children codepre  pwhat I need is same result but with CSS selector.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net2a46U relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net2a46Uap

Negative 382 pI am working on a wordpress site and would like to add a label that shows an animating number to the target number.p  pHere is an example top right of this page a hrefhttpsservicestack.net relnofollowhttpsservicestack.netap  pI have found a few jQuery based animators. If you can point out some more such animators, it will be helpful to pick the best one. For my animation, the target number is static it is not coming from any database or data source. I should be able to say target of 100 and start from 94 so the number can animate from 94 to 100.p  pHere is one that I found a hrefhttpfredhq.comprojectsroundaboutdemoscounter relnofollowhttpfredhq.comprojectsroundaboutdemoscounterap

Negative 382 pAlright, so I am making a game where a character moves around the screen and shoots enemies. He hes a cannon on top of him  a line   but this is where I am having the problem. In the class cannon below I rotate the line around the player and this works fine. The problem I am having is that the line somehow grows in length  Not positive why, any help is appreciated. It rotates if you let it go round and round to many times Sounds a bit childish but yeahp  pP.S Sorry for the long code, thought I would include it anyway. All that you should really need is under the cannon class.

Negative 382 pI noticed that when connecting multiple edges to a single rectangleshaped vertex, the positions where they connect are evenly distributed across the side of the vertex. Is there a way to change this behavior Im using mxHierarchicalLayout.p  pIn my graph, I want the edges to be as straight as possible but only horizontal and vertical. This is what I currently have a hrefhttpwww.imagebam.comimage311dfd324091282 relnofollowhttpwww.imagebam.comimage311dfd324091282a For example, why is edge G slightly bend Id like it to go in a straight horizontal line from PIC to W4. Ideally, Id like to change a setting pervertex that sets the edge connecting behavior to connect where you like, and let the layouting figure out the best spot where the edge makes the least corners.p  pI know I can set exitXY and entryXY, but this would require me to calculate these values and the whole layouting process manually. Im looking for a better way to achieve this.p  pThank you for your helpp

I know that int is faster but what if i cast floats into int Is this faster then using a float numbers or should just go with floats p  pI dont need very high precision, becouse i mostly use that numbers for coordinates. But with much multiplications i dont use division becouse it is slower though the code i wonder what i should use.p

Negative 382 pWe have a very specialized application in our environment that is responsible for managing IP based surveillance devices, such as IP cameras, analytics devices. If a new device is added to the management database, a RTSP stateful TCP based protocol client should automatically connect to the device and setup streams. The communication is being handled asynchronously, bidirectional and needs to be constantly monitored in order to detect connection drops immediately.p  pWhere does such a concern fit into the DDD world AFAIK, the RTSP protocol is a infrastructure concern and the communication handling can be done in a application service, however certain domain rules must be applied for various aspects. Also, the whole RTSP stuff is implemented in a library, so I guess I have to create wrappers for it. Do infrastructure services throw domain events, in order to inform domain event handlers about e.g. connection lossesp

Negative 382 pI noticed that the Foldable class contains fold, foldl, foldr, foldl, and foldr, but theres no fold for strict monoidal foldsp  pHow can I emulate the behavior of fold with an IntMap which is implemented as a tree, but doesnt give direct access to the internal nodes.p  hr  ps Motivationp  pIn particular, if I have an IntMap containing M IntMaps of size K with total size N  MK, Id like to union them in ON  logM bigO running time.  Something likep  precodeunionMaps  IntMap IntMap a gt IntMap a unionMaps  fold codepre  pThis would work because IntMap is an instance of Monoid with mappend defined as union.  Note that in general, using foldl or foldr is theoretically slower since it requires OmegaN  log N worstcase running time.  Admittedly, this is probably an insignificant difference in practice, but Im pedantic enough to care about theoretically optimal bounds sp  hr  pOops, the above is wrong.  I went over it more carefully and now I realize it doesnt matter whether you use fold or foldl or foldr, the running time will be in ON  logM.  So I no longer have any motivation for this question.p

Heres the code of the function Im usingp  precodescope.save  function       http         method POST,         url data.json,         this is the json file with all the information I use         data scope.jsondata    this contains the modified data     .successfunctionresponse          addLogSuccess message.     .errorfunctionresponse         addLogError message.       codepre  pI dont want to write a lot of code to handle a request server side I dont even know if PhoneGap will handle that..., since I honestly dont even know where to start to do that. I dont know if a transformRequest or another simple thing can allow me to save the json file... Any insights on what to do Should I save the modified .json file with some magic code, or maybe Im looking at this problem in the wrong way and should go down a different pathp  pThanksp

Negative 382 pThis question is as much theoretical to learn as it is of practical relevance to my code, but Im curious what goes on under the hood.p  pI have a very simple object I create which will generate one or two futures, but probably never more then two per initialization. If youre curious the futures are for DB calls and the object is little more then a helper function to avoid redundant code. I will likely use it in a part of my code that will be run in a loop thousands of times at least, and speed is important. Im wondering what the best way of building the futures is, from an efficiency standpoint. Would any of these options be noticeably faster or preferablep  ol lipbuilding the futures by hand, without an executor service pli lipinitiating an executor service for so few futures what is the expense of initializing an executor vs. gain when creating futurespli lippassing in a preinitialized executor servicepli ol  pI dont know what the executor is doing behind the scenes. I assume there is thread pooling and other overhead being eliminated by an executor service such that passing in a preinitialized codeExecutorServicecode would get me a small speed gain However, if anyone can quantify what expenses may be entailed in each option, and what gain I may see by preferring one over the other that would satisfy my curiosity. Im not looking for full benchmarking, just a general understanding of tradeoffs being made which may help to inform me enough that I can have an idea which approach should be my emfirstem attempt at efficiency, prior to benchmarking and optimization, or alternatively if there is minimal expense for any option above thats a fine answer as well. p  pAny interesting details which will make me more knowledgeable about futures and executors and efficient utilization of them is welcome actually this question is as much about learning as about my current code. I suspect that i will see minimal speed increase in my current code its just what inspired the curiosity.p

Negative 382 pIm trying to achieve maximum performance in a library that needs to convert C strings to byte[] before sending them off somewhere.p  pSince a char in UTF8 takes maximum 4 bytes, my current approach is to preallocate a large byte[]. When a string arrives for encoding, I can use a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.text.encodervvs.110.aspx relnofollowSystem.Text.Encodera to populate the byte array with it. If the strings char length  4 is bigger than my buffer, I allocate a new one optimizing via a buffer pool, but this is supposed to become relatively rare quite quickly.p  pMy only issue with this solution, is that System.Text.Encoder doesnt appear to accept a string  only a char[]. Retrieving a char[] from the string involves another seemingly needless copy. Theres an unsafe version with char pointers, but Im prohibited from using that in my library at the moment.p  pAs a side note, StringWriter, which also does UTF8 conversion, maintains an internal buffer. This is again unsuitable  I need my own buffer since I encode other data types as well e.g. ints.p  pSo does anyone have any idea where Encoder doesnt provide a method that works directly on Stringp

Both of those files have some schema and semantics. I also see that I have a local repository at code.m2repositorycode.

Im not entirely sure I can do this though, because I would need to detect when they are done filling it out.p  pBut I was thinking it would be nice if I could do it this way  Show the pdf embedded on the webpage, let them fill it out and print it, then capture everything when they are done.

In the process, I end up loading 3 bitmaps, since I need to load the original bitmap sized appropriately for the display and reorient the bitmap based on EXIF data.  Im very quickly calling code.recyclecode on each bitmap, but Im noticing that my memory doesnt seem to change.p  pHeres what the Memory Monitor showsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQjUBb.png altmemory monitorp  pAs you can see, after loading the image Im using about 60MB of memory.  When I rotate the device that drops off a bit then comes back up.  That leads me to think there is no leak, since the memory never goes above that.p  pWhen I click the GC button in the memory analyzer, my memory footprint drops dramatically to around 8 MB.  This makes sense as the three bitmaps created during the process were recycled, so can be garbage collected.  Then you can see that when I rotate again and the activity is rebuilt, the memory jumps right back up.p  pHeres my code to show you why so many bitmaps are created and when theyre recycled.p  precodevoid layoutImage      ...         Bitmap bitmap  loadOrientedConstrainedBitmapWithBackouts...     imageTexture  new GLTexturebitmap     bitmap.recycle  recycle bitmap 2   Bitmap loadOrientedConstrainedBitmapWithBackoutsContext context, Uri uri, int maxSize      ...     Bitmap bitmap  loadBitmapWithBackoutscontext, uri, sampleSize  create bitmap 1     ...     Bitmap out  orientBitmapbitmap, orientation  create bitmap 2     bitmap.recycle  recycle bitmap 1     return out   Bitmap orientBitmapBitmap source, int orientation      ...     return Bitmap.createBitmapbitmap, 0, 0, bitmap.getWidth, bitmap.getHeight, matrix, true   create bitmap 3  codepre  pIm not really sure that this is a problem, so to speak, since the memory isnt climbing so no leak, but Im curious when it stays so high.  Since forcing a garbage collection clears it just fine, should I assume that if the system needs that memory it will be collected on the next GC pass  Its been running the whole time Ive been writing this and is still sitting comfortably at 60 MB.p  pstrongQuestion 1strong Can I just trust that the garbage collector will take that memory back if neededp  pAlso, if were supposed to be so judiciously recycling our bitmaps, why do so many of the Bitmap methods say things like The new bitmap may be the same object as source, or a copy may have been made.  Do I really have to check the equality every time I use those methods to recycle the bitmap if its a different objectp  pstrongQuestion 2strong When using Bitmap creation methods, that may or may not return the same bitmap or a copy, do I need to check source and output equality to recycle the source if its a copyp  h1Edith1  pI have tried analyzing this with MAT, using a heap dump at peak usage should be 60 MB, but it only reports 18.2 MB of usage and nothing unusual looking.  Could they be reading things differentlyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtbsMn.png altenter image description herep

Negative 382 pIm debugging a process that runs really slow when is executed from gdb on Windows mingw32, so I decided to run it until it crash without gdb, and then to attach the debugger.

Negative 382 pI have an ASP.NET MVC application that consumes various operations of a Web API. It uses ACS for security and so users have to log on first with their Microsoft account before they can do anything.p  pOne of these web API operations is getting the list of permissions for the currently logged on user. This call is done for every page request, as we need this information to correctly display, disable or hide UI elements. This works fine.p  pAs permissions dont change often, I would like to cache them so that the call to the web API is only done the first time.p  pNormally session is the way to keep userspecific data in memory, but I want to remain statelesssessionless.p  pWould it be technically OK to use the strongapplication cachestrong, in which I store the permissions with a key that includes the users unique identification Are there any risksdisadvantages of doing it like thisp  p[I also would like to keep the option open to later replace it with Azure distributed caching later, if needed, but for now the solution should be a simple built in one which is free ]p  pstrongEDITstrong the cache is meant to live as long as the user is working, so its mostly shortterm cache.p

Not sure is tracking is the cause, and I should somehow alter this, but for the moment I am resorting a more direct approach by using p  precodedb.ExecuteStoreCommandINSERT INTO Order [SupplierId] Values 0, SupplierId codepre  pHowever, how do I get the newly generated PK value after the commit to the Database. In the DB, it is an integer Identity column. Can any of these direct DB methods return a new PK value, like AddObject does after SaveChanges. Also I am very mindful of the issue of getting the wrong record if another user inserts into the same table at the same time.p  pThe only other workaround which would work is to store a Guid with the Insert and then dop  precodevar myOrder  db.Order.Firstrgtr.GuidmyGuid int myId  myOrder.Id codepre  pThanks in advance.p  pEDITp  pWhen I use this ExecuteStoreCommandSelect by Guid approach on SQL Azure, I reduce the Insert Transaction time from 300ms to 60ms, so it is significant.p  pIncidentally on my local dev server which has SQL Server on the same machine the unimproved code took 90 ms instead of 300ms. So it seems the network latency in Azure is penalising the AddObject approach more harshly.p

Negative 382 pI noticed codejQuerycode has one locale for codeSpanishcode which is codeescode.  When you change your browser to a codespanish localecode which can be codees, esUS, esMX, etccode, since there is only one jQuery spanish file, it only loads the file if the locale is codeescode.  Is there a way to convert between the locales that .NET returns to you using the codeCultureInfocode object to the ones that jQuery expectsp  pHere is scenario to better explain my situation.  If I change my browsers language to codeescode, codeCultureInfo.CurrentCulturecode returns codeesEScode, however, jQuery does not contain the locale codeesEScode, it just has codeescode, but in certain cases it does have something like codeenUScode and codeenGBcode, so what is the best way to go about this. Should I just rename locale files or do some sort of conversionp

Negative 382 pHere is my situation I have written a number of Chrome userscripts for my personal use. Previously, I only had one machine with one instance of Chrome on it, so I was perfectly happy to dump any persistent data into localStorage. p  pHowever, I now have multiple machines, and want to use my userscripts on Chrome on all the machines, with my persistent data coming along for the ride. Synchronizing the userscript code itself is straightforward if a bit tedious stick it in a Bitbucket repo, then pull and manually install, but I have no idea how to synchronize my localStorage data across machines.p  pI have considered converting my userscripts to proper Chrome extensions and using the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.chrome.comextensionsstorage relnofollowchrome.storagea API data stored using a hrefhttpsdeveloper.chrome.comextensionsstoragepropertysync relnofollowchrome.storage.synca apparently can be syncd if you have a Google account connected to your Chrome instances, which I do. However, here is the issue with that for my use casep  ul liIn order to synchronize your data, it appears that you have to publish your extension to the Chrome store.li liI dont want my extensions publically viewable on the Chrome store, since 1. that costs money and 2. some of the extensions are sensitive in nature.li liEven if I were to spend money and thereby solve 1., the only way Ive found to put private extensions on the Chrome store is to be using Google Apps for Work or Education cf. a hrefhttpssupport.google.comchromeaanswer2663860hlen relnofollowPublish a private Chrome appa, and I obviously dont have a personal instance of Google Apps. li ul  pSo is there some way for me to either 1. sync localStorage across machines directly, or 2. use the chrome.storage.sync API without a publically published Chrome extension p

Negative 382 pI need to debug a nonWeb Spring Boot application, which uses codeCommandLineRunnercode to carry out its tasks, using Eclipse. My project is managedbuilt using Gradle, and the source code is written in Groovy. I can rundebug it by runningdebugging the Main class which is also the codeConfigurationcode but its not behaving correctly. When I run the app using codebootRuncode Gradle task provided by Spring Boot plugin, it runs fine. However when I run in inside the IDE, my Spring Repository returns codenullcode. It probably has something to do with run configuration, but Im not very familiar what settings need to be specified.p  pSince my main concern is to be able to suspend the process at set break points, Im thinking using the Eclipse Gradle integration could also do it for me as well, if only I can run tasks in debug mode, which I dont know how, or if even possible.p

Negative 382 pIm involved in a project where the application we are developing can be customized and additional features added to it through pluginjars. When the application launches, it checks the plugins folder for any jars and attempts to load all the classes defined in that jar.p  pData generated by the application is stored on disk after serializing through Kryo. Ideally, data generated by one user with one installation of the application should be accessible to another user with another installing of the application. Also ideally, the two users should be able to maintain independent configurations of their installation with independent sets of plugins.p  pThe complication is if any of the data generated by User 1 depends on a particular class defined in one of the plugins that are present on User 1s installation of the application. If User 2 then tries to access that data and the class is not available in their installation, we need to fail gracefully without completely rendering the data inaccessible to User 2.p  pOur team has been able to design data structures that should, in principle, be able to fail gracefully and not render the data completely inaccessible. However, wed like to implement some JUnit tests to verify their behavior. To this end, we were hoping there could be some way save generated data to disk, then unload the class definition, and finally attempt to reload the data from disk and verify certain assertions, all in a single JUnit test run. p  pIs there an elegant way to do thisp  pAs an example, say the application we are developing is a codeCircusManagementcode application which generates and saves data about the properties and maintenance of various codeTroupecodes. The capabilities of a particular codeVenuecode depend on which pluginjars are included in the installation of the application at that venue. At codevenue1code the venue manager updates troupe data and saves the data to disk. The troupe is now at codevenue2code and the venue manager is attempting to load the data from the last venue. However, codevenue2code doesnt have any codeOnSiteVetCliniccode and so cant load any of the data associated with that, but should be able to load all the other data. We need a JUnit test that will simulate the generation of data on disk from codevenue1code that includes the codeOnSiteVetCliniccode data type, and then the loading of that from codevenue2code that doesnt have that data type.p

Negative 382 pI have a probably really stupid question, but were very confused. Our designer is making the screens for a WinRT Win 8.1 application on Adobe Illustrator, using, as usual, Segoe UI. Problem is that the font sizes hes using look drastically different on both a Surface Pro 3, and my own laptop where Im developing. Its not that it just looks bigger, thats normal, the resolutions are really different. The proportions are completely off. He has a text with Segoe UI size 52, and it takes a lot more  screen size while running as a Windows Store app than it does on Illustrator.p  pI figured that font sizes were different on WinRT and the desktop environment. To test this, I ran a WinRT app, took a screenshot of a screen with a text with a certain size. Compared it against, for example MS Word, zoom 100 so it should be real size, same text, same font size. It STILL looks way bigger while running on the app.p  pWhat am I missing Shouldnt both texts look exactly the same, if the text on Word and the text on the WinRT are being displayed on the same computer, same resolutionp  pExample img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNiJLq.png altThe image above comes from MS WordPad, the second comes from a Windows Store app, both on the same computer, same resolution, both Segoe UI Light size 36 You can see both texts having very different sizes.p  pThanksp

Negative 382 pI want to build a filter search for my application. However, there are a few restrictions. I have to be able to dynamically add conditions as well as dynamically modify the columns and joins I want to fetch.p  pI have tried using a JPA Repository from Spring Data with Specifications, and it builds the WHERE clause as desired, however I have no control over what columns and what joins Hibernate issues to the DB.p  pI have also tried using the Hibernate Criteria API with Projections. The issued Query was as desired and I had full control over the selected columns and joins, as well as the WHERE clause, however, the result transformation proved to be too troublesome for parsing nested objects I tried using a custom result transformer, but to no avail, for a single level object, the default behaviour was fine.p  pThe solution I have for now is building the HQL string depending on the case. However, I have written code for building WHERE clause and I was wondering if there is a way to reuse it e.g. get the HQL string from the Predicates of Spring Specifications, or from the Hibernate Restrictions.p  pOf course, if there is a better way to do all that, I would be thankful if you shared.p

Negative 382 pI am looking to migrate from TFS 2012 onpremises to Visual Studio Online using the OpsHub Visual Studio Online Migration Utility. I have run into an issue that I cant seem to find a resolution for. To eliminate any customization, I have created a brand new team project in TFS 2012 using the process template SCRUM 2.0. I did nothing else after creating that new project. The goal was to run the migration utility on this new project to see if I can get it to work. During the migration, it fails with the error Template Customization or Template Mismatch Error. Since I know for sure we never modified the SCRUM 2.0 process template that I used to create this new project, I assume the error is more with the fact that TFS 2012 SCRUM 2.0 template is different that Visual Studio Online. Using TFS Team Project manager utility I can see they are quite different.p  pSo the question is, does OpsHub not support migration from TFS 2012 to Visual Studio Online when no customization to process template was made It does not look like it does unless I am missing something. Can anyone help me determine what I need to do to make this migration a success.p  pThanks,p

Negative 382 pHow to load millions of data at once more efficiently and provide local search options based on the recordid the current implementation takes 2 minutes to load all the data at once, once loaded its in the local memory hence searching any recordid is simpler, but we need to minimize 2 minutes initial loading time.p  pI have an option of lazy loading approach by loading 1k or 2k records at a time, where in, if I have to search a recordid which is not loaded yet, then I have to make a web service call to get the details which consumes time and is not best suitable for me. I also need to provide a local search option on the fetched records i.e when I type starting letter of some recordid all the relevant recordids starting with the same letter must appear just like google search, in case of lazy loading we do not get all the recordids instead we only get few ids which are loaded so far.p  pWhat is the best way to implement this, most important factor is to keep local search option in place so that searching based on recordid is fasterp

When I get the Venue Id just created, I see the location object with its id among the embedded ones, but what if I need to edit that address and link the Venue 1 with the location 2 instead of location 1 that was originally createdp  pSecondly, I couldnt reproduce this process with the products creating and linking the product with the venue in the same POST call where this last one is being created. Nether figured how to add an existing product to the Products collection of a particular Venue. So, which way is the more appropriate 1 call creates and link them all vs multiple creation calls  Patch calls to link them together and what do I need to make them happen in Apigility  Doctrinep  h1Update Jul 20thh1  pWoo This was interesting finding. In order to update the location of a specific venue I had to add a new location field in the Venues service. With this, I could post a location object as an extra attribute together with the ones that Venues requires. Or specify the id by adding codelocation id  123code this also works with PATCH, which is what Ive been looking for. Great. But I realize that there is no actual validation that checks that the location with the specified Id actually exists. If none is found, then the new venue will be linked to a null location. frowning p  pSo, after that, I saw the Apigility Doctrine validators that are included. smile  codeZFApigilityDoctrineServerValidatorObjectExistscode validates that the object Im sending actually exist in the DB. Yeeyyy All I had to do is add it as a validator for location field and specify two options based on a hrefhttpsgithub.comdoctrineDoctrineModuleblobmasterdocsvalidator.md relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdoctrineDoctrineModuleblobmasterdocsvalidator.mda codeentityclass  DbEntityLocationcode so the validator knows what Entity Im trying to validate, and codefields  idcode, which is like a validation criteria.p  pNow when I try to post a venue, I need to specify the location with codelocation id123code. This is also working with PATCH. I get a great error message when the location is not found with the specified Id, which is great. And a 500 one if no Id is provided One problem at time, I guess....p  pNow, I keep trying to find how to add an object to an entity collection. like, adding products to a specific venue.

I was very surprised that no one came up with any answers, so I am pretty sure my issue is fairly rare. Yesterday, as I was selfdiagnosing the issue, I began connecting the dots.

Keep in mind, UDP servers and clients that I run both on a local network and locally work, so I dont think its a problem with the Socket module as a whole, but just the TCP side of things.p  pSome info on my computer Windows 64bit, running Python 2.7.9 for some reason, 32bit, Laptop connected to a network via built in Wireless card.

Negative 382 pThis might be the worst StackOverflow title Ive ever written. What Im actually trying to do is execute an asynchronous method that uses the asyncawait convention and itself contains additional await calls from within a synchronous method multiple times in parallel while maintaining the same thread throughout the execution of each branch of the parallel execution, including for all await continuations. To put it another way, I want to execute some async code synchronously, but I want to do it multiple times in parallel. Now you can see why the title was so bad. Perhaps this is best illustrated with some code...p  pAssume I have the followingp  precodepublic class MyAsyncCode      async Task MethodA               Do some stuff...         await MethodB          Some other stuff           async Task MethodB               Do some stuff...         await MethodC          Some other stuff           async Task MethodC               Do some stuff...       codepre  pThe caller is synchronous from a console application. Let me try illustrating what Im trying to do with an attempt to use codeTask.WaitAll...code and wrapper tasksp  precodepublic void MyCallingMethod      ListltTaskgt tasks  new ListltTaskgt     forint c  0  c lt 4  c              MyAsyncCode asyncCode  new MyAsyncCode         tasks.AddTask.Run gt asyncCode.MethodA          Task.WaitAlltasks.ToArray  codepre  pThe desired behavior is for codeMethodAcode, codeMethodBcode, and codeMethodCcode to all be run on the same thread, both before and after the continuation, and for this to happen 4 times in parallel on 4 different threads. To put it yet another way, I want to remove the asynchronous behavior of my codeawaitcode calls since Im making the calls parallel from the caller.p  pNow, before I go any further, I do understand that theres a difference between asynchronous code and parallelmultithreaded code and that the former doesnt imply or suggest the latter. Im also aware the easiest way to achieve this behavior is to remove the asyncawait declarations. Unfortunately, I dont have the option to do this its in a library and there are emreasonsem why I need the continuations to all be on the same thread having to do with poor design of said library. But even more than that, this has piqued my interest and now I want to know from an academic perspective.p  pIve attempted to run this using PLINQ and immediate task execution with code.AsParallel.Selectx gt x.MethodA.Resultcode. Ive also attempted to use the codeAsyncHelpercode class found here and there, which really just uses code.Unwrap.GetAwaiter.GetResultcode. Ive also tried some other stuff and I cant seem to get the desired behavior. I either end up with all the calls on the same thread which obviously isnt parallel or end up with the continuations executing on different threads.p  pIs what Im trying to do even possible, or are asyncawait and the TPL just too different despite both being based on codeTaskcodes p

Negative 382 pTwo months ago my provisioning profile with name ASD expired uuid 7f3.... I renew this ASD provisioning profile, change this provisioning profile on XCode target settings new uuid 242... and push app version 2 to app store. Two days ago I was preparing build with app version 3 and also I sent app to review without any problems. Today I saw that by mistake during branch switching I restore target settings and I used during sending app version 3 to AppStore this old provisioning profile which expired uuid 7f3.... Strange for me is that there wasnt any problems to send app to AppStore. Now I am afraid if Apple can reject app due to this fact. Of course I can create build one more time with provisioning profile with uuid 242... but I will lost two days of waiting to review.p  pThis old provisioning profile with uuid 7f3... hasnt got name in XCode. Only identifier is visible in XCode settings.p
