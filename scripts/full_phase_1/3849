Positive 3849 pI have an existing application  where I have AMD modules defined using strongRequireJSstrong. I use text and i18n plugins for requirejs extensively in my project.  I have been experimenting with ES6 modules lately and would like to use them while creating new modules in my application. However, I want to reuse the existing AMD modules and import them while defining my ES6 modules.p  pIs this even possible I know Traceur and Babel can create AMD modules from ES6 modules, but that only works for new modules with no dependency on existing AMD modules, but I could not find an example of reusing the existing AMD modules.p  pAny help will be appreciated. This is a blocker for me right now to start using all ES6 goodies.p  pThanksp

Positive 3849 pI am working with the Joomla Rocket Theme template Camber. It has a horizontal split menu system. Virtually a horizontal dropline menu that only goes 2 levels. It then splits off to a side menu. This side menu is a module that you allocate to any position via the Gantry admin panel.p  pI have 2 problems I would appreciate any assistance withp  ol lipThe Menu Title It has 4 suffixes that control the look of the Menu Title. I would like to add a 5th suffix to remove the Menu entirely. I would simply like to know if anyone knows where or which css file I can amend to either remove the titleheader, so I just have menu items and not a headertitle, or how I can add the necessary code to include an additional suffix that removes the header. The same as the Joomla module parameter to allow you ShowHide the Title.pli lipIn addition, I would ideally like to change the css to allow me run another or 3rd horizontal level if possible. Any help would be appreciated. pli ol  pThe problem is in the RT template code, not Joomla.  If I created a Joomla module I could easily remove the header in the ShowHide module parameters. Because the Split off from the main menu to a sub navigation or sub menu is automated in the gantry code, there is no actual side menu module as such. It appears on the website as a module, but there is no module in the admin module listing. Therefore I have no access to any parameters to change.p  pI have added a link to show the menu headertitle I would like to remove nachalministries.orghomefinance . It is the Finance Menu submenu title I would like to remove the TitleHeader, so the submenu appears more like an horizontal dropline menu item. Thanks again for any help and assistance if possible.p  pKind Regards Mikep

Positive 3849 pI use the application component segmentation logic when creating my angular application, which is to say I have the following folder structurep  precodeapp.module.js app.config.js components  core  core.module.js  etc...  component1  component1.module.js  etc...  component2  component2.module.js  etc...  etc... shared  sharedComponent1  etc...  etc... assets codepre  pNow, I group all my components into my codeapp.module.jscode file and thats pretty much all that file is there for. My codecomponent1.module.jscode will list dependencies that module requires and so on. Now, I realize that it sort of doesnt matter where I define module dependencies and that I can put all my dependant module, regardless of component in the codeapp.module.jscode file, but thats simply not clean nor does it offer good modularity.p  pThat being said, Im not sure what to do with modules that are used in every, or almost every other module, like modules for localization for example. The real problem here isnt that the whole app uses that module, its that that universal module needs to be configured, so I was thinking about putting that dependency, and the required configuration, in the codecore.module.jscode and codecore.config.jscode file, respectively.p  pIve read a lot about angular best practices, but I wasnt able to find something concerning module dependency organization which, I suppose, is because angular puts all the modules in a big box anyway.p  pAnother approach would be to create a shared component that focuses on incorporating that particular dependency, or group of dependencies into angular, and then have my other components depend on that component, but Im not sure if this is too much.p

Positive 3849 pIn a JS module which needs bootstrap, I currently writep  precodedefine[dep1, dep2, bootstrap], functiondep1, dep2   codepre  pThat is NO variable for the bootstrap dependency, as that module only extends the global JQuery object without exporting anything.p  pHow can I achieve the same behavior in Typescript I triedp  precodeimport dep1  requiredep1 import dep2  requiredep2 import bs  requirebootstrap codepre  pbut the generated JS is likep  precodedefine[require, exports, dep1, dep2], function, exports, dep1, dep2   codepre  pand the bootstrap module is NOT loaded.p  pThanks in advancep

Positive 3849 pI am trying to build a Zigbee 802.15.4 network simulation in OMNeT using INET 3.0 framework MiXiM was deprecated and replaced by this version . The problem is that unlike 802.11, the Zigbee is not fully standardize by its Alliance, so the modules in the framework are not complete nor ready for use.p  pI searched for an example that uses Zigbee all over the web but found none that uses INET 3.0, I found some that uses the old MiXiM. The INET 3.0 was released a few months ago.p  pI also tried to build my own Zigbee node but was not very lucky.p  pCan anyone please guide me to an example of Zigbee simulation in OMNeT under the INET 3.0 framework, or at least a node structurep  pI forgot to mention that I am a novice to OMNeT and to INET.p
Positive 3849 pAfter spending hours and hours searching for a solution to my problem and browsing the various forums including this one i finally decided to ask my question, hoping that it has not been fully answered elsewhere.p  pIm trying to build a pretty complex architecture p  ul liI have C sources that i compile in separates static libraries .a li liI use them via JNI in a module Libraryli liI want to use this library in an app project.li ul  pI first successfully did the following tests  I already managed to make a module library without NDK and compile it with the app.  I also managed to use the static libraries and JNI directly in the app butp  pI am failing with the following step   The combination of JNI inside the module and app calling the classes of the module doesnt work.p  pI think the problem is with the include of the aar, because I cant find the explodedaar in the build directory of my app while the aar is in the library buildoutputs directory.

Ive also looked into codeTypeDefinitioncode since it seems like the only way to define a new type from scratch. p  pThe problem with codeContext.getModule...code though is that it returns an array codeArrayltTypegtcode, not codeArrayltTypeDefinitiongtcode, so I cant append new codeTypeDefinitioncode to it plus I have to figure out how to write those, emughhem.

Plus anytime new files are dropped in the defined folder, same problem you need to compile first before the IDE detects it. Yes, I really like autocompletion p

So I got my calculator out and arrived at a scaling factor of something around 3.779.p  pIt turns out that simply slapping everything thats supposed to go on the page in a codeScaleTransformcode has one nasty side effect strongFont sizes are scaled toostrong naturally. This, however, is not what I intended. I would like 12pt Arial to render like 12pt Arial would render normally.p  pIs there any other way to strongchange the coordinate system without having to call into extensionsstrong or whatever to convert each and every coordinate, length, thickness and so on  or  Is there any way to strongmap font sizes ontheflystrong, being DependencyProperties Via a custom control that wraps all the paper content, maybep

Negative 3849 pIm building a Zendbased Web app that will permit thirdparty extensions.p  pEssentially, this applications database will have a generic content store. Extensions are added to render different pieces of content in different ways.p  pThink of a rich mail store When the user asks for a Calendar item, I instantiate a Calendar class or something and ask it to render the items content. The same database might contain Mail items, which are rendered by a different class or whatever. So Im basically defining a base class with the needed methods to handle content items, and then addins are written which inherit from that to deal with specific item types.p  pEach of these addins may need to access its own View files, since each of them will obviously have a different visual layout. p  pI cant foresee all the content renderers that might be used new ones will be installed in some fashion so that my application knows when I see content with a database type column of XYZ, Ill call the XYZ thing to render that.p  pLikely, what will happen is this User will visit a URL for the application, thus triggering an action within a Controller. That Controller will use a Model method, telling it which specific content item was requested.p  pFrom there, either the Model or the Controller which needs to call something what that gets the item from the database okay, the Model clearly does that and renders it using some predetermined View. This would be PART of a larger page that might well include several rendered items as in, a list of content items. p  pSo two questionsp  ul lipWhats the best way to architect this in Zend Framework I emdoem want these addins to inherit from a base renderer class that I provide, because very simple renderers may simply need to call functionality from that base class, rather than having any of their own code e.g., a Note and a Memo might well use the simplified rendering functionality from the base renderer class.pli lipWhats the best way to register these addins with my application An .ini file, perhaps a database table The goal is simplified installation steps for whoever is operating the application  e.g., editing an .ini file is often easier than manually querying a database, although I could also provide an admin backend UI for new content renderers to be registered in.pli ul

Negative 3849 pIm working on an MFC application, that got pretty messy over years and over different teams of developers. The resource.h file, which contains all commandmessage mappings grew pretty big over time, and has lots of problems like duplicate IDs.

I saw that most of the command IDs in resource.h generated by Visual Studio begin around 100. Shouldnt this cause some interfering with MFCWindows commands and messages, that overlap with the application defined IDs For example, I have a command ID p  precodedefine IDMYID 101 codepre  pand there is a windows command that has the same ID.

Negative 3849 pIm trying to come up with or find a reusable system for database schema versioning in php projects.p  pThere are a number of Railsstyle migration projects available for php. a hrefhttpcode.google.compmysqlphpmigrations relnofollowhttpcode.google.compmysqlphpmigrationsa is a good example. It uses timestamps for migration files, which helps with conflicts between branches.p  pstrongGeneral problem with this kind of systemstrong When development branch A is checked out, and you want to check out branch B instead, B may have new migration files. This is fine, migrating to newer content is straight forward.p  pIf branch A has newer migration files, you would need to migrate downwards to the nearest shared patch. If branch A and B have significantly different code bases, you may have to migrate down even further.  This may mean Check out B, determine shared patch number, check out A, migrate downwards to this patch. This must be done from A since the actual applied patches are not available in B. Then, checkout branch B, and migrate to newest B patch. Reverse process again when going from B to A.p  pstrongProposed systemstrong When migrating upwards, instead of just storing the patch version, serialize the whole patch in database for later use, though Id probably only need the down method.  When changing branches, compare patches that have been run to patches that are available in the destination branch. Determine nearest shared patch or oldest difference, maybe between db table of run patches and patches in destination branch by ID or hash. Could also look for new or missing patches that are buried under a number of shared patches between the two branches.p  pAutomatically merge down to the nearest shared patch, using the db table stored down methods, and then merge up to the branches latest patch.p  pstrongMy question isstrong Is this system too crazy andor fraught with consequences to bother developing My experience with database schema versioning is limited to PHP autopatch, which is an uponly system requiring filenames with sequential IDs.p  h2Update, 2 years laterh2  pThis is an old post, but I wanted to mention that Ive abandoned migrations in general during development as theyre unnecessarily complicated and error prone.p  pInstead, I use build scripts to p  ol liclear the database,li licreate the schema,li liadd known application data real content, andli liadd fixture data development content.li ol  pWhen changing branches, or receiving updates from other developers, you reload the database completely with one command to get to a known state. p  pProduction servers still need database patches, but those would have to be manually created anyway.p

I needed to change the contentOffset as well.p  pIve tried to fix this two ways  both by using the scrollRectToVisibleanimated method of UIScrollView, as well as trying to set the contentOffset property directly. And Ive experimented by putting this code in implementations of both the onestep and twostep responses to changes in Orientation. For examplep  precodevoiddidAnimateFirstHalfOfRotationToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation  [self.scrollView setContentOffsetCGPointMakecurrentlyViewedPhotoIndex  largeImageHeight,0 animatedYES] codepre  pIn all cases though, it just looks janky as hell. Either I clearly see the scroll happen, or it just jumps. Uuuuuuuuuuugly Is there a way to do this so that it behaves exactly like the Photos app doesp

Everything is working fine on my development machine, and when I manually compile via VS2010 and manually deploy to a test machine that doesnt have development tools installed.p  pIn order to get the test machine to work without installing VS2010 or ReportViewer.exe, I had to add references in my project to Microsoft.ReportViewer.Winforms, Microsoft.ReportViewer.Common and Microsoft.ReportViewer.ProcessingModel and have them all Copy Local.p  pI have the rdlc files configured for Build Action  embedded resources.

THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO REPLIED.strongp  pHello,p  pI am trying to solve a problem that I may have approached from the wrong direction, so maybe someone could suggest a better solution.p  pI am writing a little web app for work, that has a search function. When user submits a search string, form gets posted to a CodeIgniter controller. If search returns a result, CodeIgniter loads a page with results. If there is no results, users current page just gets reloaded, without any indication that search returned no results. So, this is not user friendly at all and i decided to redo that with some help from code.ajaxcode.p  pThat was rather easy, but now I am stuck trying to figure out what to do with the data i receive back, if search is successful. I know code.loadcode can replace a part of the page, but i need to redirect the user to a completely different page, while POSTing the data my ajax search just returned.  The data that comes back from PHP is in codejsonencodecode format. p  pstrongNOTEstrong code.jGrowlcode is a jQuery plugin that displays a Growllike message.p  precodealiass.submitfunction       event.preventDefault     var term  inputaliassearch.val      .postltbaseurlgtaliasessearchAliases,            searchTerm term ,           functiondata                ifdata                 .jGrowlSearch for   term   returned no results,  life 5000                else                                   How do i post this data to another page and redirect a user there                                codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrong I managed to find a workaround to this issue.p  pI take the data that was returned from code.postcode and use code.loadcode to POST it back to the same controller, that in turn takes the data and loads correct view files.

Negative 3849 pLong time reader, first time poster.p  pIn Android, capturing date from datepicker and storing as string in sqlite.  Sorting by date doesnt work because theyre strings unless Im doing it wrong.p  pIve googled this issue for 5 days, and it looks like there should be a way to capture the date from the date picker, convert it to a Long, store it in sqlite as a Long, select and sort on the Long date value, then convert the Long back to a mmddyyyy string for display.  Ive tried various combinations of parse statements, Date, FormatDate, etc. with no luck at all.p  pMy actual application flow would be On activity start, get todays date and display it in button which calls the datepicker. Capture new date from datepicker if one is entered, save it as a long to sqlite. On opening an activity showing a listview of records, select from sqlite with orderby on date Long, convert Long to mmddyyyy string for display in ListView.p  pIf someone could point me at a code sample, it would be greatly appreciated  thanksp  pEvanp

Negative 3849 pThis is one of those days when youd wish you were a lawyer. p  pIve written lots of code privately, for my own projects. There is now a possibility that I am going to participate in a commercial project. Were only talking maybe two developers, but the rest of the company is large.p  pIt would be nice if I could reuse the code that I have already written privately, as hobby projects. This would definitely save time. The problem is licensing. What will happen when I leave the company In that case I would want the company to give me credit for using my code. p  pIt seems to me that the best option would be to release the code under a permissive license that allows the company to use it, while retaining ownership of the code  then hand over the code, in compiled form whenever possible. If you think otherwise, let me know. p  pSo my question is Which license should I use I am basically looking for two licensesp  ol lipA license that allows anyone to use the code without restrictions, modify the code without restrictions , but forces them to give me credit if any of my code is used. pli lipA license that allows anyone to use the code without restrictions, but modifications and redistributions are not allowed. Credit must also here be given to me.pli ol  phr  I do not know of any licenses that fit perfectly, so Im seeking the help of the more lawknowing programmers out there. I believe the LGPL comes fairly close to both, but its complex and also forces the user of the code to ensure that end users of the product can upgrade to a later version of my code. That is not good, I do not want that restriction. Writing my own license is also out of the question as I do not have the required knowledge to ensure a professional outcome.p  pI also have a few related questions regarding this How do you go about ensuring that the company does not violate the license How do you prove what license and terms the code was released under How do you prove that the code was not written during worktime and should be owned by the company These are turbulent times, and I need my back covered to make any conflicts completely out of question. p  phr  strongUpdatestrongp  pThis is a simplified BSD license, do you think it will work for case 1p  blockquote   pCopyright codeltyeargtcode codeltcopyright holdergtcode.

For example...p  precodeclass CustomerInvoice      public satic string TemplatePath                get  return CTemplatesInvoiceTemplate.doc            public static DocumentType DocumentType                get  return DocumentType.WordDocument            public static void CreateCustomer customer, int orderNumber               ...       codepre  pAll of these classes share the same method emnamesem, but not necessarily method emsignaturesem.p  pFor example, I might havep  precodeCustomerInvoice.CreateCustomer customer, int orderNumber DespatchNote.CreateCustomer customer, int orderNumber, Warehouse warehouse PackingLabel.Createint orderNumber codepre  p... or whatever struggling to come up with sensible examples.p  pIs there a mechanism in OO which specifies what method names a group of classes has in this way Im really thinking of just having a way to enforce consistent implementation and naming accross a group of similar objects, so they are more intuitive for consumers. Would a case like this be considered a validworthwhile use of any such techniquep

Negative 3849 pIm working on building an X11 server for Windows from scratch based on a copy of the X Protocol Reference Manual Volume Zero.

Negative 3849 pso, I have this webpage here [ a hrefhttpsaikonet.org relnofollowhttpsaikonet.orga ] and its not loading the tipsy script. If you go into the source, its on line 11.

Im not sure how to proceed..p  pand btw, the way I checked whether its loading or not was via the script tab in chromiums inspect elementp

Negative 3849 pI am developing a Linux device driver running on an embedded CPU. This device driver control some external hardware. The external hardware has its own DDR controler and external DDR. The hardwares DDR is visible on the embedded CPU via a movable memory window so I have paged access to the external DDR from the Linux driver. Im using Linux kernel version 2.6.33.p  pMy driver uses sysfs to allow control of the external hardware from userspace. As an example, the external hardware generates a heartbeat counter which increments a specific address in external DDR. The driver reads this to detect if the external hardware is still running.p  pIf the external DDR is not working correctly then an access to the external DDR produces a bus error on the embedded CPU. To protect against simultaneous multithread access, the driver uses a semaphore. p  pNow to the problem. If a thread grabs the semaphore, then terminates with a bus error, the semaphore is still locked. All subsequent calls to grab the semaphore block indefinatly.

Negative 3849 pWe have a small .NET 4.0 DataGrid WPF demo with the code posted below. It consists of a nonvirtualized DataGrid with 30 columns and 3000 rows. It is nonvirtualized, due to us requiring grouping capabilities, which do not support virtualization.p  pWhen you run this app, and switch between it and other windows, there is a noticeable lag of about 1 second. This only occurs when the window is reactivated  once activated, clicking around inside has no associated delay.p  pWe have profiled this lag that occurs on window reactivation using the performance analyzer and have found that there are a lot of dependency property notifications being triggered when the window is brought back into focus. We do not know why this happens, and it seems unnecessary.p  pWe find this delay is proportional to the number of rows in the DataGrid. Does anyone know how we can eliminate or reduce this lagp  pUPDATE It seems like the focus lag occurs even when staying inside the application but focusing on another control such as a textbox outside the grid.

Negative 3849 pI have a COM server CSTA MFC based app and a COM client CMTA. The COM server must live in an STA, since its an MFC app I have no choice in this matter. The client issues a call to the server, and the server issues a callback to the client. Thats where the error happens codeRPCECANTCALLOUTININPUTSYNCCALLcode. Im guessing if the server had been an MTA, this problem would never have arised, but sadly, the documentation for MFC explicitly denies initializing the apartment as an MTA.p  pAny ideas on how to work around this problemp  pI have been toying with the idea of letting the server object the object I expose through the running object table live in an apartment of its own MTA. Would this be a good idea, or is there something simpler to try firstp  pstrongUPDATEstrong p  pThe server object is just a thin interface point to certain functions within the application. Most of the time it just reads and writes to memory locations, but there are instances where it generates window messages to various windows within the application. The server object itself is not the entire application.p

Negative 3849 pDoes anyone have a way to add multiple folders and existing files within those folders to a Visual Studio project in a single step or via macro  Lets assume all of the folders and files were copiedpasted into the project folder where they need to reside relative to the project folder, but are not actually stored in the .csproj or .vbproj file, which I believe is a requirement to compile those files into the solutionproject.  p  pThis works great if you have a web application project in your solution, but not so well if you have a .csproj or .vbproj.  In that case, you must manually add folders and nested folders, and add existing files and browse to each one individually, which can take a long time.p

Negative 3849 pfirst time poster, long time reader.p  pSo I needed to create a quick and simple treasure hunt. The ideas was to store some values in a cookie and, when the user click on an element with a matching id, update the following value. Its not in there yet but when the person has found all 8 in this case it will trigger something.p  pNow, Ive gotten it to mostly work but Im running in to a big problem. The cookie is not being stored from page to page. If Im working off a single test page its just fine  the cookie is created, values are pulled from it and put in to a check array, and the counter increments correctly. Also, when the cookie is updated the new values are being stored just fine.p  pHowever, when I go to another page and check for the cookie  its gone. Now I checked to see if the cookie was actually getting dropped in and yes, its there. But there are multiple cookies all with the same name they are updating values  but again its only page to page so no cumulative effect.p  pSo, I guess I dont understand why when I call the cookie and reset it, its not affecting a single cookie but creating a new onep  pOh, Im using jQuery 1.4.2 and the jQuery cookie plugin.p  precode if not present create default array and store in cookie cookie if.cookietreasurehunt  null   var treasure  new Array     arteContactEn,0,     arteCorpEn,0,     arteServicesEn,0,     arteRoomsEn,0,     arteDiningEn,0,     artePackEn,0,     arteHotelEn,0,     arteHomeEn, 0     .cookietreasurehunt, treasure,  expires 7     capture cookie info var treasureFound  .cookietreasurehunt   create check array and parse values into it var treasureCheck  new Array var treasureCheck  treasureFound.split,   function checks array and tallies total found items function checkFound   var foundItems  0  forvar i0 ilttreasureCheck.length i      var value  treasureCheck[i]     ifvalue  1          foundItems        writes found items to span on page .thProgress.textfoundItems     check number artefacts and write to page var treasureTotal  treasureCheck.length  2 .thTotal.texttreasureTotal   on click checks element id against array and, if found, marks the following value as 1 .artefactright, .artefactleft.clickfunction var artefactID  this.attrid  forvar e0 elttreasureCheck.length e      var matchID  treasureCheck[e]     var k  e  1      ifmatchID  artefactID          treasureCheck[k]  1           checks for total found items         checkFound           updates cookie with new array         .cookietreasurehunt, treasureCheck,  expires 7           codepre

Negative 3849 pOk, so this may not be the best design decision, and I dont really want to use something like LuaBind...

Negative 3849 pNot being a web guy I dont know all the quirks of HTML.  I am attempting to center some dynamically sized content inside of a div.  This content should always be centered, so I hooked into codewindow.resizecode to do it.  I then manually call codewindow.resizecode after applying the CSS to force it to run once.p  pThe problem is that the div does not center horizontally emat firstem, only vertically.  Subsequent window resizes force the div to center properly.p  pInitially I thought that I must be trying to center the div before it was ready as I am calling it first embeforeem codedocument.readycode fires, but the vertical centering works and I added some trace statements and, sure enough, the codeleftcode position is being calculated correctly, just not applied seemingly.p  pAnyway, this is my first real foray into HTMLCSS, so Im sure you guys will nail it quickly.

Negative 3849 pI rewrote the original radix sort algorithm for Python from emWikipediaem using arrays from emSciPyem to gain performance and to reduce code length, which I managed to accomplish.

Negative 3849 pTypically measures in an OLAP cube are a numbers, and these numbers get aggregated via addition or via some notveryexotic function like times or MAX or MIN. Im wondering if any of the major OLAP servers let you make measures that are emsetsem of numbers, or emsetsem of strings. Set here is in the mathematical sense, not the OLAP jargon sense of a list of tuples. Whereas OLAP typically aggregates measures via numeric functions, my hypothetical set measures would be aggregated via set operations, e.g. set union or set intersection.p  pIm interested both theoretically and practically. Theoreticallyabstractlymathematically, theres a nice parallel between additionoverintegers and unionoversets, and it seems like someone could have considered this parallel in writing an OLAP server. One potential implementation, if all the possible set members were known in advance, is to represent each set as a potentially large integer, and then to aggregateunion by performing bitwise OR.p  pAs for practice, Ill attempt to provide a concrete case where this might seem at least marginally useful Suppose you had a dataset where each fact was the metadata associated with an academic paper. Each paper might have a date, a topic, and a set of one or more authors, like sop  ul lifact1 Year 1997, Topic  AI, AuthorSet [Bill Jones, Martha X]li lifact2 Year 1997, Topic  Linguistics, AuthorSet [John Q, Sam S]li lifact3 Year 1997, Topic  Linguistics, AuthorSet [John Q, Jack X]li lietc.li ul  pIm using quasiJSON here only because it helps make it obvious whats multivalued.p  pIf you created an OLAP cube around this data, it would seem very natural to be able to make a report showing how the set of authors writing on a given topic changed from year to year. In MDX, it might look like thisp  precodeselect [Measures].[AuthorSet] on columns, [Year].[Year].All on rows where [Topic].[Topic].[AI] codepre  pFor each year, this query would roll up the list of authors via set union.p  pTo get the very most out of this feature youd probably need custom OLAP client tools that knew about set measures in particular. But for existing clients you could probably just fall back to some string representation of a set. e.g. the above query could return cells containing, e.g., the string Bill Jones Martha X John Q Sam S Jack Xp  pIm most familiar with SSAS, and SSAS doesnt seem to support anything like this out of the box. It seems like there might be a way to hack it together using measures of string type, maybe plus custom CLR functions, but I havent figured it out yet.p  pThis particular case you might also be able to solve in MDX only, maybe using custom members, Generate and SetToStr Solutions welcome But my intuition is that as things get more complicated itd be more natural to have the set aggregation happen more naturally behind the scenes, with this set member functionality.p

Negative 3849 pIf mapping inheritance using table per concrete class, while mapping concrete classes simply just as any other class without unionsubclass, NHibernate allows same PKs across subclasses. For example if you have BillingDetails and subclasses CreditCard and BankAccount, requesting all BillingDetails will get you all records from both tables, which can in turn have duplicate primary keys, which can be problematic due to not valid business identity of those objects. This of course is not the case with guids and such, but what about cases of plain identity or sequence id generatorsp  pSimply, the question is, is there any real use of this scenarion of duplicate id keys when requesting polymorphic query like that Could these duplicate ids make problems for NHibernate when handling entities internallyp

But couldnt the design just have some parameter of the event like .touches That could go along with the .pressure, .finger width, etc... maybe a .type  touch or .typemousep  pIm sure a lot of thought went into having touch events, so Id bet there are some valid reasons.p

That is, when the user zooms, I dont want the content to flow.  Is there some CSS or media query solution I can use that would allow content to be set to the devicewidth in both portrait and orientation modesp  pThank you.p

Once I stop the model running, the remaining thread status lines get reported and the script exits.p  pstrongEDIT 3262012 1624 ESTstrongp  pSEAWAT does allow concurrent execution as Ive done this in the past, spawning instances manually using iPython and launching from each model file folder. This time around, Im launching all model runs from a single location, namely the directory where my script resides. It looks like the culprit may be in the way SEAWAT is saving some of the output. When SEAWAT is run, it immediately creates files pertaining to the model run. One of these files is not being saved to the directory in which the model realization is located, but in the top directory where the script is located. This is preventing any subsequent threads from saving the same file name in the same location which they all want to do since these filenames are generic and nonspecific to each realization. The SEAWAT windows were not staying open long enough for me to read or even see that there was an error message, I only realized this when I went back and tried to run the code using iPython which directly displays the printout from SEAWAT instead of opening a new window to run the program.p  pI am accepting J.F.

Negative 3849 pI need to build a DLL capable to load other DLLs at runtime these other DLLs have a rather intimate relationship with the main DLL this is Python and extensions, so they must have a common runtime. The main DLL emmustem be a single file that can be simply copied on the target machine. The auxiliary DLLs will be placed in a different directory. p  pSo common runtime means no static linking single file  simple copy rules out the shared MS redistributables, especially when coupled with different directories. p  pI only see the following options link all DLLs against codemsvcrt.dllcode embed current codemsvcrtXXcode into the main DLL and reexport all its symbols use the codemsvcrtXXcode of the host application. To me the first looks the simplest, because its a common need and there are many web pages explaining how to go about it. How would you approach thisp
Negative 3849 pI have a requirement where I need to have a type safe way of accessing property names, without actually instantiating an object to get to the property.  To give an example, consider a method that takes as arguments a list of IMyObject and a string that represents a property name a property that exists in IMyObject.p  pThe methods implementation will take the list and access all the objects in the list using the property name passed... for some reason or another, we wont dwell on thatp  pNow, I know that you can do this using an instantiated object, something like ...p  precodeDim x as MyObject  nothing Dim prop As PropertyInfo  PropHelper.GetPropertyOf MyObjectFunction x.MyProperty codepre  pWhere my helper method uses reflection to get the name of the property as a string  there are numerous examples of this flying around on the webp  pBut I dont want to have to create this pointless object, I just want to do something like MyObject.MyProperty  Reflection allows you to iterate through a types properties and methods without declaring an object of that type... but I want to access a specific property and retrieve the string version of its name without iteration and without declaring an object of that typep  pThe main point here is that although I am trying to get the property name as a string... this is done at run time... at compile time, I want this to be type safe so if someone changes the property name, the compilation will break.p  pCan anyone help in this questp

Negative 3849 pI currently have a C Application that is a distribute, and that multiple people have. I was wondering which approach could I take to hide the app.config file .exe.config file that is produced after a build, So that the users cannot see my connectionstrings to my remote server. I read somewhere that If I encrypt the file, It can only be decrypted on the machine It was encrypted on, which means that It would not work for the other computers that the application is on, It would only work on my PC. Which approach could I take so that The config file can be hidden  obfuscated  encrypted, or anything to protect the config file, But without it being specific only to my computer, that can actually work for any one else who has the distributed version Any help would be appreciated, Thanksp

Negative 3849 pHeres the problemp  pA user has a shopping basket containing items, where each item has a set of available delivery types which is a subset selected from some defined overall set e.g. [UK 2nd class, UK 1st class, UK Recorded Delivery], but dont get too hung up on the exact names.p  pWhen going through the checkout process, the user should be presented with the option of either separate or combined delivery.p  pSeparate is easy  a table is displayed where each item is on its own row, and the set of columns matches the union of available delivery types among the items. Each row contains a radio button set, one button for each column that is of a delivery type available to that item.p  pIts combined Im unsure how to approach. Items can be combined into a group only when all items in that group share a subset of available delivery types. Items with mutually exclusive delivery types can never be in the same group. The basket can contain items from multiple vendors when this is the case, products from different vendors may not be grouped together, even if they share a delivery type.p  pThe client requires that the emminimumem number of groups is calculated, irrelevant of the emcostem of each type of postage. Yes, that means that if separate deliveries for four items would cost 1234 four different delivery types, but the items all share a fifth delivery type that costs 15, then the user would be presented with that single moreexpensive group for the combined option.p  pa hrefhttpdarine.orgcodedeliveryoptions.htm relnofollowHere is an HTML example of separatecombined optionsa.p  pThe available delivery types for an item are retrieved from the database using a stored procedure, and have a unique identifier created from the type ID and vendor ID, so that its easy to compare equality between types. However, I cant seem to conjure up an efficient algorithm for doing the comparisons and generating groups.p  pThe end result Im hoping for in terms of data structures is pseudocodep  precodeBasket  ListltItemgt Items  gt GroupsTable      ListltSelectableDeliveryTypegt Columns,     ListltGroup  ListltItemgt gt Rows  codepre  pWhere each codeItemcode contains its own codeListltAvailableDeliveryTypegtcode which can easily then be used to work out which codeSelectableDeliveryTypecode column to put its radio buttons in.p  pAny thoughts, pointers to general algorithmic concepts which cover this I dont think its a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSetcoverproblem relnofollowset cover problema for example etc. greatly appreciated.p

For this purpose, I usep  precodeCGContextSaveGStatectx              Saves the current graphic context state CGContextRotateCTMctx, MPI2       Rotates the context by 90 clockwise strPos  CGContextConvertPointToUserSpacectx, strPos SHOULD convert to Usercoordinates [str drawAtPointstrPos withFontfnt] Draws the text to the rotated CTM CGContextRestoreGStatectx           Restores the CTM to the previous state. codepre  pctx CGContextRef, strPos CGPoint and str NSString are variables, that have been initialized properly and correctly for horizontal text, with a width of the text height.p  pWhile this code works flawlessly on the iPhone 3, it gives me a complete mess on the iPhone 4 Retina, because the CGContextConvertPointToUserSpace function produces completely different results, even though the coordinate system of the iPhone is supposed to remain the same.p  pI also tried using CGAffineTransform, but only with the same results.p  pTo summarize my question How do I draw a text to a calculated position in the parent coordinate system 0, 0 being top leftp  hr  pAfter studying the Apple docs regarding Quartz 2D once more, I came to realize, that the rotation by Pi2 moves all my writing off screen to the left.p  pI can make the writing appear in a vertical line by translating the CTM by height. Ill keep trying, but would still be happy to get an answer.p  pEdit Thanks to lawickos headsup I was able to fix the problem. See Answer for details.p
Negative 3849 pI try to implement the karger Minimum Cut algorithm a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiKarger27salgorithm relnofollowKarger wiki pageap  pSo far, I have tried my algorithm on small examples input of size 10 and it seems to work.

Negative 3849 pIm using Titanium for an Android device and SOAP for the webservice data transmission.

Maybe I am targeting a different JRE when launching Tomcat which doesnt have the trusted certificatep  pThe certificate is signed by my companys trusted enterprise authority, so I guess its a sort of enterprisewide selfsigned certificate. The certificate authority is registered in Windows trusted certificate authorities when I check in the Management Console Certificate SnapIn. I suspect that doesnt matter though.p  pAm I going to have to use codekeytoolcode to generate a certificate to add to the trust store on every server that will be hosting this Tomcat applicationp

EDIT the reverse method only affects the array in questionp  pBut is it possible to rewrite the above function to ensure array.protoype affects only the stored buffer I want reversed If not, is there another way to go about storing both a forward and reversed version p

Negative 3849 pI have a simple C app it is WPF, and I am polling a network location for any new .pdf.

This technique works great.p  pHowever, the other day I ran into an exception Could not find part of the path P DirectoryNotFoundException.p  pI noticed the drive was mapped to the PC, but when the IT guy clicked on the drive in windows explorer, it required a login and password. We were then able to view the P in explorer, but my app still could not access the p.p  pI had the IT guy remove the loginpassword and then it worked but it could have been due to a restart too, I am not sure.p  pWhat is confusing me is that I am not aware of any moment where they enabled password protection for the mapped location, so I am not sure when, why, or how it stopped working. I didnt even know it was password protected.p  pThat leads to my very simple yesno question If a mapped drive is password protected in windows explorer, and a user types in the loginpassword so that they can get to it in explorer, is that enough such that my app does not need to login with userpass information p  pIf the answer is no, then I will google the proper technique for accessing p using a userpass. But any explanation about my problem is surely appreciated.p  pThanksp

The UIWebView is the only VC I need to rotate.p  pI blocked all but one VC from turning, but that VC is in the More tab. I initially had a quirk where this More VC would change orientation to landscape when rotated and then any subsequent VC would be in landscape, but I found this httpstackoverflow.coma125261521050388 and creating a category for UINavigationController helped to solve that issue. p  pHowever, when I navigate to that tab in the More list, and turn the VC, it doesnt rotate.

Negative 3849 pI have a VS.NET 2010 solution with several projects.  I just added a new library project the.library.assembly.  The startup project is a website.  When I run the website, I get this errorp  blockquote   pCould not load file or assembly the.library.assembly or one of its dependencies. Strong name signature could not be verified.

This was related to trouble shooting the signed issue. I have unchecked that in project properties and gone through all projects in the solution.  None are signed.  I get the build error nowp  precodeAssembly generation failed  Referenced assembly the.library.assembly does not have a strong name. codepre  pI thought maybe this was related to a WCF service the.library.assembly was referencing.  I removed the service and related code.  Everything built fine.  I added the service back.  Another good build.  I added service related code back to the.library.assembly.  Still builds.  Then I added the.library.assembly calls into the web app.  Thats when I get the above build failure.p
Negative 3849 pJust as noted in the title, we run a page for our business, and i saw this on another companys page.

Again, and i will reiterate, i saw this on a perfectly valid FB page. Below is a link to one of their albums. Note that this is entirely within the facebook domain. Click on any photo in this album and in the description you will see the text Like www.facebook.comOxfordBeach to tag your photos in this album which from what i can tell is, in fact, a facebook setting. i have tested by liking the page, verifying that i can then tag a photo, then unliking the page and that ability disappears. at no point am i required to authorize anything  its just a normal page like. this is not an app, or api being used here. there is no clickjacking, code injection, fql or open graph or any other nonfb clientside code being executed, nor am i interested in using any of the above or breaking any ToS. im just wondering if its a FB setting im missing. Ive been through FB documentation and cant find any mention of it, and i have a FB forum question outstanding.p  pHere is the public album a hrefhttpswww.facebook.commediasetseta.361407077282795.87068.197745466982291amptype1 relnofollowhttpswww.facebook.commediasetseta.361407077282795.87068.197745466982291amptype1ap  pSECOND EDIT I should note that the ability to comment on the photo exists whether or not you like the page. so i wrote that in the initial question in error. its really just the tagging of photos that is switched on or off based on whether or not you like the page.p

Negative 3849 pI am using Rails 3.2.8. I want to access a record from the application do some processing and return the results in the form of a modified record. I am doing this through json requests to the controller. It is working properly, but I get CSRF warnings when I post the update of course. I thought to remove these by storing the session cookie from the original request and using when doing the post. This also seems like a good security practice. p  pThe problem is that a session cookie is not being sent. I have tried using HTTParty and RestClient gems. When I make the request in the browser using RESTClient plugin for firefox the cookies are sent. I presume that this is the expected behavior as cookies ought to be sent to browsers.p  pIs there a way to get the cookie to be sent to a scriptp  pIs it correct to do so and if not how should I be approaching thisp

Negative 3849 pI am creating an implementation of a hash table in C for educational purposes.  p  pThe hash function should return a sizet hash. Since the size of sizet is different in different platforms and I want to use a hash function that hashes all the bits in a sizet, I thought of creating different hash functions for different sizes. As the hash function will be used as a function pointer, I suspect the compiler cant inline code like thisp  precodesizet hash4void key, sizet size sizet hash8void key, sizet size  sizet hashvoid key, sizet size      if sizeofsizet  4              return hash4key, size          else if sizeofsizet  8              return hash8ket, size        sizet hashFuncvoid key, sizet size  hash codepre  pAnd two levels of indirection will be used each time the hash function will be called.  p  pThats why I thought of doing something like this codesizet hashFuncvoid key, sizet size  hashsizeofsizetcode instead. Only one level of indirection will be used. The problem is that the sizeof operator isnt available during the prepossessing phase.  p  pSo what would be a good way to define a preprocessor value which will expand to the correct size of sizet in each platform I guess I could check against predefined macros, but I wonder if theres a better way.p

Negative 3849 h3Disclaimer I am asking these questions in relation to an assignment. The assignment itself calls for implementing a bitmap and doing some operations with that, but that is not what I am asking about. I just want to understand the concepts so I can try the implementation for myself.h3  pI need help understanding bitmapsbit arrays and bitwise operations. I understand the basics of binary and how leftright shift work, but I dont know exactly how that use is beneficial.p  pBasically, I need to implement a bitmap to store the results of a prime sieve of Eratosthenes. This is a small part of a larger assignment focused on different IPC methods, but to get to that part I need to get the sieve completed first. Ive never had to use bitwise operations nor have I ever learned about bitmaps, so Im kind of on my own to learn this.p  pFrom what I can tell, bitmaps are arrays of a bit of a certain size, right By that I mean you could have an 8bit array or a 32bit array in my case, I need to find the primes for a 32bit unsigned int, so Id need the 32bit array. So if this is an array of bits, 32 of them to be specific, then were basically talking about a string of 32 1s and 0s. How does this translate into a list of primes I figure that one method would evaluate the binary number and save it to a new array as decimal, so all the decimal primes exist in one array, but that seems like youre using too much data.p  pDo I have the gist of bitmaps Or is there something Im missing Ive tried reading about this around the internet but I cant find a source that makes it clear enough for me...p

This is a normal phenomenon.h1  pIt seems that, on mobile phones, the running Activities, that are in Landscape mode, are switched into Portrait mode upon screen lock is a normal behaviour. At least it is true on the tested phones so far. So we have to make sure our lifecycle functions can take care this change elegantly always.p  h12. Guess this is because of the default orientation in the locked screen.h1  pWe do not have documentation or many resource talking about this issue. But the assumption that the running Activities switching back to the devices default orientation upon screen lock, as in most devices the locked screen is in Portrait, is quite logical.p  h3Further studyh3  pI just wonder how the Activities behave if we are having a landscape locked screenp

Negative 3849 pIn MVC, you can decorate a property with values that can be read out by the Html helpers. For example Html.LabelFor reads out the display attribute of a property. What I am wondering, is it possible to do this for a complete value Im exploring the possibility of controlling branded information through the use of attributes. Heres what I envisionp  precode[Branded] public string Greeting  get set  codepre  pAnd then when this property is readout, the attribute will run and pull out the branded information through some other mechanism. I think the reason I headed down this path is that we need to be able to brand as well as provide for localization. So it might end up doing something like thisp  precode[Localized] [Branded] public string Greeting  get set  codepre  pWhere [Localized] loads info from resource files, rather than pulling it in the view. The reason for this is that we dont wanna be passing around a ResourceManager throughout the session, and this would probably be much cleaner to manager once implemented.p  pIm sure this is already going to make people cringe, but Id like to explore it anyway. So Im wondering if someone could point me in the right direction or offer any relevant experience with branding in MVC4.p  pUPDATEp  pOk, now that I followed some of what was answered below regarding the creation of an attribute, I have a better idea of what my question really is, so let me clarifyp  pIve created an attribute where I can decorate a property in the view model with the name of a property either stored as a resource or through some other means which will accomodate information branding.

Negative 3849 pA Web Server can receive millions of user login request. A user can login multiple times. Design an optimal algorithmdatastructure in terms of time complexity to return total number of unique users between given time intervals.p  pFor e.g  Count total number of unique users between interval t1 amp t2 and t2 amp t3. Also think about returning total count for overlapping intervals t1  10am, t2  1015am, t3  1030am, return total number of users between 1010am to 1020amp  pBelow is what I am proposing, Would appreciate peoples commentsp  pIMO combination of Hashmap amp min heap would be good as an optimal solution.p  pHashmap will have key as userid and value as node pointer to corresponding node in          min heap. Min heap  lastloggedin time as key and value as the userid. Root will be the user             whose login time is the oldest. Also at the root store the count of total             number of nodes in the minheap so we can quickly return the count.p  ol lipWhen a user logsin. Lookup in the hashmap with userid as key. a If no match then insert the new user into hashmap amp a new node for user into    the min heap and increment the count stored with the root node of min heap. b else its an old user update its lastloggedin value and do not increment the    count in root node of min heap.pli lipWhenever we want to find out the unique users logged between t2t1 then  a. Extract minroot from the heap and check if         current time  lastloggedin time  t2t1 mins. If it is greater than        delete the value from the hashmap amp minheap.  b. Repeat the above step a until the min element of the heap satisfies         current time  lastloggedin time lt t2t1 mins  c. Return the value of the count from root node of the min heap.pli ol  pBut I am not able to nail down the algorithm for overlapping intervals.p

Negative 3849 pI need to get jqueryui tabs functionality working on a div.  The div lives inside of a few other elements.

The html for both the top div and the div in the popup are strongidentical.strongp  pAlso, my script is called like thisp  precodewindow.loadfunction       .detailpopupinfo .tabs  codepre  pI did that because I wasnt sure if the actual DOM was finished before that got called, but it looks like it didnt really help.  I think the issue might have something to do with inheriting lots of other properties When I inspect the css properties, they look totally different.p  pThe top div im guessing doesnt inherit anything since I hard defined it in the html page.  The other div, in the popup, is sent in as a string to a function and probably gets shuffled around.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com91T20.png altpopup errorp  pHere are the css properties of the broken onep  precodebackgroundcolor rgb255, 255, 255 cursor auto fontfamily Helvetica Neue,Arial,Helvetica,sansserif fontsize 12px fontsizeadjust none fontstretch normal fontstyle normal fontvariant normal fontweight 400 height 100px lineheight 16.8px textalign left width 200px mozfontfeaturesettings normal mozfontlanguageoverride normal codepre  pHere are the css properties of the working onep  precodebackgroundattachment scroll backgroundclip borderbox backgroundcolor rgb255, 255, 255 backgroundimage urlhttplocalhost3001stylesheetsimagesuibgflat75ffffff40x100.png backgroundorigin paddingbox backgroundposition 50 50 backgroundrepeat repeatx backgroundsize auto auto borderbottomcolor rgb170, 170, 170 borderbottomleftradius 4px borderbottomrightradius 4px borderbottomstyle solid borderbottomwidth 1px borderimageoutset 0 0 0 0 borderimagerepeat stretch stretch borderimageslice 100 100 100 100 borderimagesource none borderimagewidth 1 1 1 1 borderleftcolor rgb170, 170, 170 borderleftstyle solid borderleftwidth 1px borderrightcolor rgb170, 170, 170 borderrightstyle solid borderrightwidth 1px bordertopcolor rgb170, 170, 170 bordertopleftradius 4px bordertoprightradius 4px bordertopstyle solid bordertopwidth 1px color rgb34, 34, 34 fontfamily Verdana,Arial,sansserif fontsize 9.6px height 100px paddingbottom 1.91667px paddingleft 1.91667px paddingright 1.91667px paddingtop 1.91667px position relative width 200px mozborderbottomcolors none mozborderleftcolors none mozborderrightcolors none mozbordertopcolors none codepre  pI guess thats kind of the weird part.  The working one has many more css properties than the broken one.  Maybe emjqueryuiem applies some extra properties to it to make it work, but for some reason it isnt applying them to the popup divp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pSo I guess it turns out jquery actually isnt finding the divs inside the popups because they are dynamically added and removed from the DOM every time one is opened or closed.  Heres a picture of the html without the popup opened.  Normally, they reside under codeleafletpopuppanecode, which is empty.p  pMaybe Ill have to resort to hardcopying the css properties of the working one and applying them manually to the popup divs.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeG8ue.png altenter image description herep  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pJust confirmed its because the popup html doesnt exist in the DOM.  I did a codesetTimeoutcode on the jqueryui tabs function and quickly opened one and it styled it correctly.br But once I close it and reopen it, its gone again.p

Negative 3849 pI am modifying a lightbox Magnific Popup layout to include a reponsive caption div. The aim is to have the caption float next to the photo, and then collapse beneath the photo when the window is resized.p  pI want the caption to have a minimum width of about 300px the exact width is not important, this can be a percentage. If the window width cannot accommodate the combined width of the photo which varies from photo to photo  the width of the caption, the caption should flow beneath the photo and span the full width of the photo, as you can see in this diagram  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9KWcR.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe problem is thisp  pI have tried to use codedisplayinlineblockcode on both divs but cannot get the caption div to resize after it collapses underneath the photo.

Negative 3849 pIm having problems getting my app to retain its state when it becomes paused due to switching away from it. Ive overloaded the onSaveInstanceState and onRestoreInstanceState methods to save and restore the only object which contains the variables important to my applications state consisting of a bunch of arrays, arraylists, hashsets, enumerations, and primitives. Unfortunately, switching away from my app causes it to crash with a serialization error. Here is the code I have for saving and restoring the statep  precodeOverride public void onSaveInstanceStateBundle savedInstanceState       Next line causes error when switching apps, but not when rotating screen     savedInstanceState.putSerializableboard, board  Override public void onRestoreInstanceStateBundle savedInstanceState      board  BoardsavedInstanceState.getSerializableboard  codepre  pAs far as I can tell, my only problem is that the Board object Ive created is not serializable. However, it implements Serializable and defines its serialVersionUID, so I dont know what more I need to do to make it serializable. Normally that is all thats necessary.br I have two questions  p  ol liIs there a better way to save and retrieve instances of objects than the getSerializable methodli liWhat can I do to make my object serialize without throwing a runtime exceptionli ol  pI find this exception particularly odd because my object seems to serialize without problems when the screen is rotated, but causes an error when the app is switched out. Ive included the stack trace below, in case its relevant. I can also post code from the object in question Board if requested.

Negative 3849 pIve got an app with a UIView hierarchy that looks something like thisp  precodemainView is always rotated appropriately for the user     topView1         thumbnail1.1         thumbnail1.2         thumbnail1.3     topView2         thumbnail2.1         thumbnail2.2         thumbnail2.3     topView3         thumbnail3.1         thumbnail3.2         thumbnail3.3 codepre  pThere are any number of topViews UIView subclasses and each of those has any number of thumbnails, each of which is a UIImageView subclass. Using functionality of the app, one or more topViews can be moved off screen. When this happens, the image property of the thumbnail is nilled out. If its topView is moved back on screen, the image property is restored.p  pThe problem is that the images are not appearing as expected. So how am I doing thisp  pIn a loop, I am setting the image property in a background thread using GCD. After the image property is set, I call code[thumbnail setNeedsDisplay]code. This is what I expected to make the restored image visible, and, in fact, some of them do appear, but some do not. Am I running into a GCD issuep  pTheres another function of the app that will rearrange all thumbnails on a topView it just rearranges their positions. If I call that function, all the images become visible.p  pPerhaps important, but I wouldnt think so, is that when the topView is brought into view, it is done with animation. I wouldnt think this is important, because the values set for such an animation done with UIView animation methods go into effect immediately, even if the animation takes a while.p  pDo I maybe have to call setNeedsDisplay in a completion blockp

Negative 3849 pIve got a datepicker in my Android app, but now I want to change the color of the blue dividers into green see the image below this text. There are a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14849147changedividercolorandroiddatepickerdialogsomea a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12711212howtochangeandroiddatepickerdialogsdividerscolorsothera a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11077530howtochangethedefaultcolorofdatepickerandtimepickerdialoginandroidrq1discussionsa on Stackoverflow that talk about the same, but none of them gives an answer which leads to a solution.p  pSo I went looking myself and found there is actually an androiddatePickerStyle and there is also an androiddivider. I dont know however, whether the divider is actually referring to the divider in the datepicker at all. I tried a multitude of combinations of the two, but I dont seem to get it to work. So my first question strongDoes the androiddivider refer to the divider in the datepicker, and how could I use it to change colorstrongp  pSo another option is supposedly to create a fully new custom datepicker. If that enables me to just change the color of the divider Im down for it. So I had a look at a hrefhttpjavapapers.comandroidandroiddatepickersomea a hrefhttptechnet.weblineindia.commobilehowtoimplementacustomdatepickercontrolwithmaximumandminimumdaterangeinandroidapplicationofa a hrefhttpwww.opensourced.deshowarticle.phparticleid56thea a hrefhttpwww.entrycoder.com201305howtoshowonlymonthandyearfields.htmltutorialsa on creating a custom datepicker, but none of them seem to define the color of the dividers. The dividers are simply not listed in the xml files or in the java files.p  pIt would be great if there would be some kind of boilerplate code to recreate the datepicker as it currently displays, including the code that sets the color of the dividers. Hopefully that would enable me to copy it and simply change the color setting of the divider somewhere. So my second question strongWould anybody know any boilerplate code which simply implements the datepicker as it is now including a definition of the dividersstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSzmcI.png altenter image description herep

Negative 3849 pIm wondering if I do it in right way. I have my class UIMyView which I add to my main UIView. In that UIMyView i do some stuff using NSTimer and after all i call removeFromSuperView method to back to main UIView. I would like to notice when my UIMyView was closed. I use NSNotificationCenter to do it but maybe there is some other better way to do that p  pEDIT OK but I think you you didnt understand me.

Strangely, this was easier to accomplish on Windows  so many things are so much harder on Windows than Linux.  p  pThe problem that exists on both platforms is that I cannot figure out how to create virtual environments based on the python 2.7 and the python 3.x versions separately.  I can setup my path variable on Windows so that python3.3.3 is the first version of python it finds and so that is essentially the default.  I would have to go into my path environment variable and put python27 in the path before python33, then when I installed virtualenv I would have a python 2.7 environment.  That doesnt seem like the best way to do things, nor would it persist.  Similarly on Ubuntu, Id have to modify the path variable and then source the file to switch between different python installs  2.7 or 3.x.  p  pCan someone tell me a better way to do this  Perhaps a reference to instructions for how to create two different virtual environments for the different python versionsbr Also, confusing about the first reference link above, is how does eclipseaptana know to activate that virtual env Thanks, Brucep

Application developers should  consult the guide at lthttpelasticsearch.orgguidegt.   The installation procedure is covered at  lthttpelasticsearch.orgguideenelasticsearchreferencecurrentsetup.htmlgt.   ElasticSearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings,  so you can try it out without bothering with configuration.   Most of the time, these defaults are just fine for running a production  cluster. If youre finetuning your cluster, or wondering about the  effect of certain configuration option, please do ask on the  mailing list or IRC channel [httpelasticsearch.orgcommunity].   Any element in the configuration can be replaced with environment variables  by placing them in ... notation. For example   node.rack RACKENVVAR   For information on supported formats and syntax for the config file, see  lthttpelasticsearch.orgguideenelasticsearchreferencecurrentsetupconfiguration.htmlgt    Cluster    Cluster name identifies your cluster for autodiscovery. If youre running  multiple clusters on the same network, make sure youre using unique names.  cluster.name elasticsearchharith    Node    Node names are generated dynamically on startup, so youre relieved  from configuring them manually. You can tie this node to a specific name   node.name Franz Kafka   Every node can be configured to allow or deny being eligible as the master,  and to allow or deny to store the data.   Allow this node to be eligible as a master node enabled by default   node.master true   Allow this node to store data enabled by default   node.data true   You can exploit these settings to design advanced cluster topologies.   1. You want this node to never become a master node, only to hold data.     This will be the workhorse of your cluster.   node.master false  node.data true   2. You want this node to only serve as a master to not store any data and     to have free resources. This will be the coordinator of your cluster.   node.master true  node.data false   3. You want this node to be neither master nor data node, but     to act as a search load balancer fetching data from nodes,     aggregating results, etc.   node.master false  node.data false   Use the Cluster Health API [httplocalhost9200clusterhealth], the  Node Info API [httplocalhost9200clusternodes] or GUI tools  such as lthttpgithub.comlukasvlcekbigdeskgt and  lthttpmobz.github.comelasticsearchheadgt to inspect the cluster state.   A node can have generic attributes associated with it, which can later be used  for customized shard allocation filtering, or allocation awareness. An attribute  is a simple key value pair, similar to node.key value, here is an example   node.rack rack314   By default, multiple nodes are allowed to start from the same installation location  to disable it, set the following  node.maxlocalstoragenodes 1    Index    You can set a number of options such as shardreplica options, mapping  or analyzer definitions, translog settings, ... for indices globally,  in this file.   Note, that it makes more sense to configure index settings specifically for  a certain index, either when creating it or by using the index templates API.   See lthttpelasticsearch.orgguideenelasticsearchreferencecurrentindexmodules.htmlgt and  lthttpelasticsearch.orgguideenelasticsearchreferencecurrentindicescreateindex.htmlgt  for more information.   Set the number of shards splits of an index 5 by default   index.numberofshards 5   Set the number of replicas additional copies of an index 1 by default   index.numberofreplicas 1   Note, that for development on a local machine, with small indices, it usually  makes sense to disable the distributed features   index.numberofshards 1  index.numberofreplicas 0   These settings directly affect the performance of index and search operations  in your cluster. Assuming you have enough machines to hold shards and  replicas, the rule of thumb is   1. Having more shards enhances the indexing performance and allows to     distribute a big index across machines.  2. Having more replicas enhances the search performance and improves the     cluster availability.   The numberofshards is a onetime setting for an index.   The numberofreplicas can be increased or decreased anytime,  by using the Index Update Settings API.   ElasticSearch takes care about load balancing, relocating, gathering the  results from nodes, etc. Experiment with different settings to finetune  your setup.   Use the Index Status API lthttplocalhost9200Astatusgt to inspect  the index status.    Paths    Path to directory containing configuration this file and logging.yml   path.conf pathtoconf   Path to directory where to store index data allocated for this node.  path.data usrlocalvarelasticsearch   Can optionally include more than one location, causing data to be striped across  the locations a la RAID 0 on a file level, favouring locations with most free  space on creation. For example   path.data pathtodata1,pathtodata2   Path to temporary files   path.work pathtowork   Path to log files  path.logs usrlocalvarlogelasticsearch   Path to where plugins are installed  path.plugins usrlocalvarlibelasticsearchplugins    Plugin    If a plugin listed here is not installed for current node, the node will not start.   plugin.mandatory mapperattachments,langgroovy    Memory    ElasticSearch performs poorly when JVM starts swapping you should ensure that  it never swaps.   Set this property to true to lock the memory   bootstrap.mlockall true   Make sure that the ESMINMEM and ESMAXMEM environment variables are set  to the same value, and that the machine has enough memory to allocate  for ElasticSearch, leaving enough memory for the operating system itself.   You should also make sure that the ElasticSearch process is allowed to lock  the memory, eg. by using ulimit l unlimited.    Network And HTTP    ElasticSearch, by default, binds itself to the 0.0.0.0 address, and listens  on port [92009300] for HTTP traffic and on port [93009400] for nodetonode  communication. the range means that if the port is busy, it will automatically  try the next port.   Set the bind address specifically IPv4 or IPv6   network.bindhost 192.168.0.1   Set the address other nodes will use to communicate with this node. If not  set, it is automatically derived. It must point to an actual IP address.   network.publishhost 192.168.0.1   Set both bindhost and publishhost  network.host 127.0.0.1   Set a custom port for the node to node communication 9300 by default   transport.tcp.port 9300   Enable compression for all communication between nodes disabled by default   transport.tcp.compress true   Set a custom port to listen for HTTP traffic   http.port 9200   Set a custom allowed content length   http.maxcontentlength 100mb   Disable HTTP completely   http.enabled false    Gateway    The gateway allows for persisting the cluster state between full cluster  restarts. Every change to the state such as adding an index will be stored  in the gateway, and when the cluster starts up for the first time,  it will read its state from the gateway.   There are several types of gateway implementations. For more information, see  lthttpelasticsearch.orgguideenelasticsearchreferencecurrentmodulesgateway.htmlgt.   The default gateway type is the local gateway recommended   gateway.type local   Settings below control how and when to start the initial recovery process on  a full cluster restart to reuse as much local data as possible when using shared  gateway.   Allow recovery process after N nodes in a cluster are up   gateway.recoverafternodes 1   Set the timeout to initiate the recovery process, once the N nodes  from previous setting are up accepts time value   gateway.recoveraftertime 5m   Set how many nodes are expected in this cluster. Once these N nodes  are up and recoverafternodes is met, begin recovery process immediately  without waiting for recoveraftertime to expire    gateway.expectednodes 2    Recovery Throttling    These settings allow to control the process of shards allocation between  nodes during initial recovery, replica allocation, rebalancing,  or when adding and removing nodes.   Set the number of concurrent recoveries happening on a node   1. During the initial recovery   cluster.routing.allocation.nodeinitialprimariesrecoveries 4   2. During addingremoving nodes, rebalancing, etc   cluster.routing.allocation.nodeconcurrentrecoveries 2   Set to throttle throughput when recovering eg. 100mb, by default 20mb   indices.recovery.maxbytespersec 20mb   Set to limit the number of open concurrent streams when  recovering a shard from a peer   indices.recovery.concurrentstreams 5    Discovery    Discovery infrastructure ensures nodes can be found within a cluster  and master node is elected. Multicast discovery is the default.   Set to ensure a node sees N other master eligible nodes to be considered  operational within the cluster. Its recommended to set it to a higher value  than 1 when running more than 2 nodes in the cluster.   discovery.zen.minimummasternodes 1   Set the time to wait for ping responses from other nodes when discovering.  Set this option to a higher value on a slow or congested network  to minimize discovery failures   discovery.zen.ping.timeout 3s   For more information, see  lthttpelasticsearch.orgguideenelasticsearchreferencecurrentmodulesdiscoveryzen.htmlgt   Unicast discovery allows to explicitly control which nodes will be used  to discover the cluster. It can be used when multicast is not present,  or to restrict the cluster communicationwise.   1. Disable multicast discovery enabled by default   discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled false   2. Configure an initial list of master nodes in the cluster     to perform discovery when new nodes master or data are started   discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts [host1, host2port]   EC2 discovery allows to use AWS EC2 API in order to perform discovery.   You have to install the cloudaws plugin for enabling the EC2 discovery.

Negative 3849 pI come up with this question that was asked to write a code in C. So, I need to use the C synchronization primitives. p  pQ Create a method e.g. foo which accept a integer as a argument and print on console. This method is accessed by multiple threads. If two or more threads call the method with same value then only one thread should allow to print the value other threads should wait. If values are different then all threads should allow to print the value.p  pMy suggestion is using a global hashtable lets say, unorderedmapi, semaphore map. So, when fooi is called, foo checks the hashtable. If i is not in the hashtable, we add map[i]semaphore0. When i printed, map[i].release is called to allow other waiting threads with input i continue their print operation. On the other hand, if i is already in the hash, it means that other thread with the same input is running, so it should wait via map[i].aquire. p  pHope you could help me to find a better solution or a corrected version of this proposal.  p

Negative 3849 pI am developing my first libgdx 3D game. Until now i can move arround in a mazelike hardcoded world, collision detection works. Also i have some enemies with working A Pathfinding. I also loded my first pretty ugly Blender model, using codeFBXConvcode to get a code.g3dbcode file. For some reason the model lise on the floor instead of standing. Maybe i had some wrong settings when i exported it as code.fbxcode. For that i tryed to coderotatecode him arround the codezAxiscode by code90code degrees by calling codemodelInstance.transform.rotateVector3.Z, 90code in the codeshowcode method of my codeScreencode, after loading the codeModelcode and instantiating my codeModelInstancecode at a given position. For some reason it did not rotate. Then i put the coderotatecode method in the coderenderdeltacode, thinking, that it would now rotate 90 degrees every render loop. But instead it was standing still, like it should. Okay, but now i want the codemodelInstancecode to coderotatecode to where it actually looks, meaning it should rotate, depending on my codeenemiecodes codeVector3 directioncode. I am allready setting his position with codemodelInstance.transform.setTotranslationenemie.getPositioncode which works perfect. So i thought i can also use codemodelInstance.transform.setToRotationVector3 v1, Vector3 vscode, with codev1  enemie.getPositioncode and codev2  enemie.getPosition.addenemie.getDirectioncode. Note, that the codepositioncode Vector is not used directly, as it would change its values inside the codeaddcode method. Doing this, i dont see the object anymore, meaning also its position is wrong.p  pWhy is this happening And how can i rotate my codemodelInstancecode by using the codedirectioncode vectorp  pThanks a lot.p

NETWORK SERVICE, LOCAL SERVICE, DefaultAppPool, Everyone, the impersonated user etc... and its still not working. p  pIf anyone knows anything about this error, especially in the QW context, or can give me some details related to DCOM, impersonated users etc...

Negative 3849 pAssuming i have a queue  p  precodemyqueue  multiporcessing.JoinableQueue codepre  pIn my code, the parent process puts all the object e.g. a string into codemyqueuecode, myqueue will be shared by child processes, and the child process will need to check if an object e.g. xxx is in codemyqueuecode, I tried to use  p  precodeif xxx in [y for y in myqueue] codepre  pbut it gives me the error likep  precodeJoinableQueue object is not iterable codepre  pMy question is, is there any other way I can use to get what I want as above Or any way I can use to check if an object is still in the queuep  pThe reason for checking the shared queue is that the objects in the queue is interdependence, and every object has some status such as running, waiting, completed. For example, object a has a dependency A, A and a will be put into the queue by parent processbefore child process kickoff, when a child process gets a from the queue, it needs to check the status of A, if the status of A is still waiting, then a will be put back into the queue unless A is completed. In other words, A is not in myqueue anymore.p

As you can see, if you click on the link in the home section, it doesnt change the nav about to active. It just sets the link to active. If you click on a nav item it sets that to active which works great, now just a matter of adding a function so if you click on a link outside the nav with an anchor hash of the nav item, the nav item should be set to active not the link class.p

Negative 3849 pIn a hrefhttpnodatime.orgNoda Timea v2, were moving to nanosecond resolution. That means we can no longer use an 8byte integer to represent the whole range of time were interested in. That has prompted me to investigate the memory usage of the many structs of Noda Time, which has in turn led me to uncover a slight oddity in the CLRs alignment decision.p  pFirstly, I realize that this emisem an implementation decision, and that the default behaviour could change at any time. I realize that I emcanem modify it using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.interopservices.structlayoutattributecode[StructLayout]codea and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.interopservices.fieldoffsetattributecode[FieldOffset]codea, but Id rather come up with a solution which didnt require that if possible.p  pMy core scenario is that I have a codestructcode which contains a referencetype field and two other valuetype fields, where those fields are simple wrappers for codeintcode. I had emhopedem that that would be represented as 16 bytes on the 64bit CLR 8 for the reference and 4 for each of the others, but for some reason its using 24 bytes. Im measuring the space using arrays, by the way  I understand that the layout may be different in different situations, but this felt like a reasonable starting point.p  pHeres a sample program demonstrating the issuep  precodeusing System using System.Runtime.InteropServices  pragma warning disable 0169  struct Int32Wrapper      int x   struct TwoInt32s      int x, y   struct TwoInt32Wrappers      Int32Wrapper x, y   struct RefAndTwoInt32s      string text     int x, y   struct RefAndTwoInt32Wrappers      string text     Int32Wrapper x, y       class Test      static void Main              Console.WriteLineEnvironment CLR 0 on 1 2,             Environment.Version,             Environment.OSVersion,             Environment.Is64BitProcess  64 bit  32 bit         ShowSizeltInt32Wrappergt         ShowSizeltTwoInt32sgt         ShowSizeltTwoInt32Wrappersgt         ShowSizeltRefAndTwoInt32sgt         ShowSizeltRefAndTwoInt32Wrappersgt           static void ShowSizeltTgt              long before  GC.GetTotalMemorytrue         T[] array  new T[100000]         long after   GC.GetTotalMemorytrue                 Console.WriteLine0 1, typeofT,                           after  before  array.Length       codepre  pAnd the compilation and output on my laptopp  precodecUsersJonTestgtcsc debug o ShowMemory.cs Microsoft R Visual C Compiler version 12.0.30501.0 for C 5 Copyright C Microsoft Corporation.

Negative 3849 pOne of the main reasons why Im so reluctant to let go of XML is the fact that I stronglovestrong XSDsSchemas. I love specifying what element types are allowed in my XML files, what attributes they need to have, which attributes are optional, default values for the attributes, legal child elements, etc.p  pMy emunderstandingem and I could be dead wrong is that JSON simply doesnt have this concept. So lets say I want my new RESTful web service to accept data like sop  precodesandwich      type PB and J,     bread Marble Rye,     sliced DIAGONAL  codepre  pIt would be nice, from a validation standpoint, if I could specify a Schema for this JSON such that someone cant send mep  precodecar      make VW,     model Jetta,     color Silver  codepre  pThis would fail validation, since theyre sending me a car and not a sandwich. It would also be emwonderfulem to have finegrain control over the validation of all values, attributes and nested objects that the JSON document might contain just like I get with XSD.p  pSo I ask does JSON have anything like this If not, strongwhystrong If so, strongwhatstrongp  pIf I could find a viable JSONbased schema validation mechanism, I would happily convert from XML to JSON.p

I can use the code Ive got to make requests to functions of the server that dont requires the square brackets and that also works.  p  pIs there a way to make a request using these charactersp  pThank youp  pUpdated I tried the suggested code, both manually including escape codes and using Uri.EscapeDataString and it still failed.  Each  time its failing with a code 500 returned from the server, which is the same code returned if you mistype the request in the url bar of a web brower.  p  pI think the problem is that the server expects those characters to come NOT escaped and that even before I started trying to do it manually with your help, webclient might have been converting them automatically Is there a way to get webclient to send the string exactly as it comes in without encoding it  Or is there a setting for the .encoding property that might transmit the [ and ] as plane text instead of special character codes Thats what I was trying to do with the  in my initial efforts. p  pUpdate 2  I loaded Fiddler to analyze the requests...  and I was right in my diagnosis...  When I type the url into chrome fiddler shows it as including [stuff]. When I load the same address via c it comes out as 5Bstuff5D.  So Ive got to convince c to just send the url request the way I typed it without trying to be helpful and make it comply with the webstandards.  I dont know how to do that.  But...

PHP somehow needs to know what files are connected to what file names.  Therefore i will connect them using PHPs codeFILES[file][name]code with javascripts codeobject.files[].namecode.  I will do this by passing a two dimensional array with the codeobject.files.namecode as field 1 and codenewNamescode as field 2.p  pstrongThe Questionstrong How can i pass a twodimensional string array in a form input field using JavaScript or other necessary tools  Something like codeltinput typetext namenames[][] multiplegtcode would work perfectly however this is obviously not possible.  If a 2dimensional array is 100 impossible, then a onedimensional array might work too. p  pThanks guys.  If anything needs clarifying then go ahead and ask.p  pEDIT Javascript is going to grab text fields from a separate form and add them into a new input field inside the primary upload form.  The issue is actually getting them into the primary upload form in an organized and relatively clean manner.  Therefore I was looking at doing a 2dimensional array.p

Negative 3849 pI have a command line application. The issue I am facing is that sometimes the users of that application close directly the terminal in which our application is running that also using the below commandp  precodekill 9 pidofparentconsole codepre  pI the above case our application should close gracefully by doing all the necessary cleanup. For that I wrote a signal handler for handling SIGHUP signal as when controlling terminal of process exits it sends SIGHUP to processes running under it, which we have handled to exit our process gracefully.But the thing is if user open a terminal suppose that is by default bash and then he again types bash command in it then run our application and if suppose kills that applications parent process that is bash executed manually after opening terminal then our application doesnt gets SIGHUP and does not exit gracefully.For simplicity I have written the below code which reproduces the issuep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltsignal.hgt  FILE fp  NULL int flag  1  void handlerint signum      flag  0   int main      signalSIGHUP, handler      just for testing     fp  fopenfile, w       loop terminates only when HUP is generated     while flag       if SIGHUP is generated then code should reach here      and write the below in file.     fprintffp, SIGHUP Generated      fclosefp return 0      codepre  pFor simplicity I am not using sigaction for handling signals.p  pWhat I have observed is that when I open a terminal and press tty command  and note the name of stdin file associated with it, and then when in the same terminal if I enter bash command and again if I note down the stdin file associated with it using tty command, what I found out is that both the bash shells, one that opens by default when I launch terminal and one I manually opened by typing bash command in bash console share the same stdin file name.p  pSo, due to which when I kill that second bash which is parent of my process the stdin file associated with it doesnt gets closed and I think thats why I am not receiving SIGHUP signal.p  pIs there any other way I can use to kill my process too gracefully when its controlling console gets killed.p  pTerminal emulator used GNOME Terminal 2.31.3 Default shell bashp

Is there a way to create a specific form from CSJS Or how to bind the input fields from the repeat to some form fields in order to save the correct data from the repeatp  pI binded it with EL like this p  precodeltxprepeat idrepeat1 vartest indexVarindex             valuejavascriptparseIntsessionScope.dynaField rows8             styleborder1ptgt               ltxptable stylewidth100.0gt                 ltxptrgt                     ltxptd styleborder1ptwidth32.0textaligncentergt                         ltxpinputText idinputText1 valuedocrepeat[field1]gt                               ltxpeventHandler eventonchange submitfalsegt                                 ltxpthis.scriptgtlt[CDATA[try  var idxviewid1inputText3 var indexdocument.getElementByIdidx.value  var numberviewid1number var valdocument.getElementByIdnumber.value  var sum  val  forvar i0iltindexi  var input1viewid1repeat1iinputText1 var nr1document.getElementByIdinput1.value  sumnr1 document.getElementByIdviewid1repeat1iinputText2.value  sum   document.getElementByIdviewid1test.value  sum100val    catche  alertno ]]gtltxpthis.scriptgt                             ltxpeventHandlergt                         ltxpinputTextgt                         ltxpinputText idinputText2gt                          ltxpinputTextgt                     ltxptdgt                 ltxptrgt             ltxptablegt         ltxprepeatgt codepre  pBut I get a null pointer exception.

Negative 3849 pIm currently using Worklight 6.2 to develop an hybrid application for iOS, Android and Windows 8 thanks to Ionic Framework based on AngularJS. I developed most of my app without any problem for now, but today I started thinking about using JSONStore to persist and secure my local data my application can be used offline.p  pSo before now, I used scopes and the root scope of Angular to update my DOM thanks to data binding, as we always do with Angular. For example, I create a new item with the HMI, and thanks to data binding, my objects are immediately displayed in my app without having to reload anything, and my Javascript objects are updated with the latests values.p  pNow that I want to plug JSONStore, Im facing the following issue  what is the most consistent and reliable way for my app to have my JSONStore synchronized with my root scope so that every time I get new updates in my scope, JSONStore is also updated and thus, data is saved and secured on the device and ready to be synchronized with my backend.p  pMy absolute reference must be JSONStore as it is my official reliable solution for persistent data storage and encryption. The best thing would be for my app to use my JSONStore collection as the root scope, but as far as I know, its not possible to do this with Angular actually, I did not check, as it sounds very wrong. I ended up thinking that I need to maintain the 2 collections  my JSONStore and my root scope. Meaning that every time something is modified in the root scope, I have to apply it to the JSONStore. In order to facilitate maintainability, I think about observing my root scopes main object using the watch listener, so that every time my root scope is modified, I crush my JSONStore with the latest value of my root scope. Something like this p  precodescope.watchfunction      Object to be watched     return rootScope.myObject , functionnewValue, oldValue      Here, destroy the collection and init it again with the newValue object  codepre  pIm a little concerned about performances of watching this object during the whole lifecycle of my application. Even if the object will not be modified very often, the object can be quite big 50kb. Also, Im not sure JSONStore really enjoys having its collections crushed every time. But not using this would mean identifying the modification spots to update JSONStore every time a modification is done to my root scope. This could work, but is really not optimal as we need to get used to duplicate source code 1 for the scope, 1 for the JSONStore.p  pWell, this is bothering me because I cant find a really viable solution, so if you guys have ideas  best practices about this, dont hesitate to share p  pThank youp

Negative 3849 pI have a SlidingDrawer which contains an ImageSwitcher with images in it.

Negative 3849 pI am having a problem being able to run the Emulator 8.1 WVGA 4 inch 512MB from Visual Studio. When I go to deploy any of my projects, my emulator appears, Loading is displayed on the screen for about 30 seconds, then it says Windows Phone OS Is Starting.... and it sits there for about 5 minutes. Then it says Windows Phone OS Is Shutting Down and it shuts down and disappears from my screen. p  pMy HyperV is enabled and working. I checked to see if I can start the emulator from HyperV Manager instead of Visual Studio and it starts up fine without any problems. It is also 100 usable as well. Unfortunately I cant deploy my apps from VS this way, or at least I havent figured out how to if there is a way to do so.p  pComparing the 2 ways of starting the emulator, from the HyperV Manager I see my computer is constantly using the CPU to a max of 10.

Negative 3849 pIm making a 2d tile level editor you click a tile on the loaded spritesheet and then can draw it to the main area. Although it performs fine on desktop the mobile performance is emstaggeringlyem slow, so Ive been testing out various perf tweaks. Monitoring the results with framerate monitor from chrome dev tools desktop, I noticed something I dont understand. When I click on the menu icon and the overlay menu pops out visible on the left in the screenshot, uses css transformtranslate for the animation the frame rate skyrockets up to about the monitor refresh sync rate, even when drawing the canvas.p  pIf I havent touched the menu icon, the framrate is about 40fps on idle and 15fps when drawing the canvas, but simply triggering the menu animation eliminates the framerate drop. It also seems to have a lasting effect, the idle framerate of 40fps no longer drops on repaints when the menu is closed, and when the menu is open the framerate stays up near 60fps.p  pSo the question is twofold emwhyem does triggering this css animation have such a HUGE effect on canvas drawing perf 15fps vs 60, and is there any way to force a consistent 60fps without having the menu open all the timep  pPS The visibility of the menu is irrelevant, leaving it on the page makes no difference but animating it in seems to affect the framerate greatly. The menu has the null transform hack applied because it was triggering a repaint of the canvas it overlays, but removing only drops the fps a little at each stage of the process, the relative performance of the different states of the program are similar.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDCt1h.jpg altscreenshot p

Negative 3849 pWhen using the default style found in blend, a developer will get a warning from visual studio about HorizontalContentAlignment and VerticalContentAlignment upon removing items from a list or scrolling in a large list.p  pAlternatively when you call default template in Visual studio you receive a much simpler control template, which does not contain the suspect bindings.p  pBut if you look into CProgram Files x86Windows Kits8.0IncludeWinRTXamlDesigngeneric.xaml. You will find a Much larger more complex style and Template, which aslo does not contain the suspect bindings.p  pAlso MSDN has a Style with a template similar to that in the Windows kit.p  pSo basically my assumption would be to use the style found in the Windows Kit.

I needed to update the relative URL.p  pChanging the URL submitted to the .ajax from coderevocableuserspage1updatecode to codetestrevocableuserspage1updatecode fixed the issue. prabhakaran8737 was partially correct on the URL path not being correct. But as I mentioned in a comment of his answer, all this time, I thought the URL was relative to where the request was made i.e. codetestrevocableuserspage1updatecode but .ajax sees the URL call as based from its root domain. So I needed to modify the URL to be based off the root and change it accordingly i.e. codetestrevocableuserspage1updatecode.p  pI tried using absolute URLs too but that didnt seem to work either. So a relative URL from the root was the answer. And the relative URL had to have the beginning codecode forward slash. I tried code.code and I tried without the forward slash too but those didnt work.p

Negative 3849 pstrongtldrstrong short AJAX PATCH requests dont work on some Chrome and FF installations on Windows but work on others.p  hr  pI have a simple Rails app hosted on Heroku which only has some CRUD operations for admin to operate with the list of people. I tried to be RESTful so edit operations are performed with PATCH method. Also AJAX is everywhere. I have a big edit form and also bool fields that are edited separately using requests like codefoo5togglebarcode. Everything worked fine on Ubuntu laptop using FF and Chromium and on Windows 7 with Chrome. When it came to a real life use and people I did this for started using their personal laptops strange things began to happen. Edit form worked fine for everyone but toggle requests did not for some systems. I didnt find any logic, some Chrome installations returned codeERREMPTYRESPONSEcode, some did not. When they did request was not actually performed, meaning that data on the server remained unchanged. At least one was fresh and new so its not about versions. I even had one FF also last version with this problem it allowed to run 2 requests after page load and next ones didnt work without explanation. I didnt have time for experiments so just switched method to POST. And now I wonder if I can PATCH requests or maybe theres something I dont know about them. p  pThe fact the form works fine makes me think it has something to do with request size but thats probable my only idea. Unfortunately I dont have a browser that reproduces it now but can try to find if there will be any useful ideas.p

Negative 3849 pI am creating a Yeoman Generator, which up until this point has been working correctly. My index.js runs correctly in my app folder, generating the initial structure.

Jackson automatically converts to codenumber 10code without quotes. How can I fix this errorp  pstrongEditstrong p  pThe codeNonNegativeIntegercode class doesnt have any class field except a constant codezerocode field. The codenumbercode key is from my codeTestEntitycode class. So I even if I add codeJsonPropertycode annotation in my codeNonNegativeIntegerMixincode mixin class, Jackson JSON will not instantiate a codeNonNegativeIntegercode with an int type arg. Therefore, I still got the same error.p

Negative 3849 pWe have various tables to represent various types of data. Each table has a corresponding revisions table to track history of this data. Each revision entry in a revisions table has a unique number. This number is stored in a change metadata table. Each of these tables references a parentid. Before we make any changes to the tables we lock the parent row with SELECT  FOR UPDATE.p  pAfter making an updateinsert we also increment the change number and write that number to the change metadata table. To do so we do a SELECT MAX on the change metadata number and then increment it.p  pThe issue were seeing is that somehow a transaction is getting an old change number from the select max statement. To illustratep  pTransaction 1p  pSTART TRANSACTIONp  plock with FOR UPDATEp  pdo stuff...p  pGet Latest Change Number 9p  pInsert Revision with Number 10p  pCOMMITp  pTransaction 2p  pSTART TRANSACTIONp  plock with FOR UPDATEp  pdo stuff...p  pGet Latest Change Number 7p  pInsert Revision with Number 8p  pCOMMITp  pThis causes the revision insert for transaction 2 to fail as the change number is a unique key. Im leaning towards it being an issue of repeatable reads but Im not sure how the old data can persist across transactions in such a way. For each transactions theres a START TRANSACTION statement and then immediately the parent id is locked with FOR UPDATE. We have a high traffic site with multiple concurrent transactions. Its possible there are many waiting on the lock at any one time. Id be happy to clarify any point and would appreciate any insight anyone could offer.p

Negative 3849 pI am trying to understand how to use websockets correctly and seem to be missing some fundamental part of the puzzle.p  pSay I have a website with 3 different pagesp  ul linewsfeed1.html li linewsfeed2.html li linewsfeed3.htmlli ul  pWhen a user goes to one of those pages they get a feed specific to the page, ie newsfeed1.html  sport, newsfeed2.html  world news etc.p  pThere is a CoreApplication.py that does all the handling of getting data and parsing etc.p  pThen there is a WebSocketServer.py, using say Autobahn.p  pAll the examples I have looked at, and that is alot, only seem to react to a message from the client browser within the WebSocketServer.py, think chat echo examples. So a client browser sends a chat message and it is echoed back or broadcast to all connected client browsers.p  pWhat I am trying to figure out is given the following two componentsp  ul lipCoreApplication.pypli lipWebSocketServer.pypli ul  pHow to best make CoreApplication.py communicate with WebSocketServer.py for the purpose of sending messages to connected users.p  pNormally should CoreApplication.py simply send command messages to the WebSocketServer.py as a client. For example like thisp  pCoreApplication.py  Connects to WebServerSocket.py as a normal client  sends a Json command message like broadcast message X to all users  send message Y to specific remote client  WebSocketServer.py determines how to process the incoming message dependant on which client is connected to which feed and sends to according remote client browsers.p  pOR, should CoreApplication.py connect programatically with WebSocketServer.py As I cannot seem to find any examples of being able to do this for example with Autobahn or other simple web sockets as once the WebSocketServer is instantiated it seems to run in a loop and does not accept external sendMessage requestsp  pSo to sum up the question What is the best practice To simply make CoreApplication.py interact with WebSocketServer.py as a client with special command data or for CoreApplication.py to use an already running instance of  WebSocketServer.py both of which are on the same machine through some more direct method to directly sendMessages without having to make a full websocket connection first to the WebSocketServer.py serverp

Negative 3849 pWere working to build a native strongiOS titanium modulestrong to wrap the strongADTECHMobileSDKstrong library, a library we use for ads. We successfully manage to port the banner views but were having troubles with interstitialsp  pThe app crashes when the method load is called on the interstitial with the following messagep  blockquote   pentityForName nil is not a legal NSManagedObjectContext parameter searching for entity name Assetp blockquote  pIt seems to be a CoreData problem, but I have not access to the native code.p  pThere are 3 things you have to configure on an interstitial  a configuration a delegate and a view controllerp  pThe library handles the wrong values for these 3 parameters with 3 particular exceptions, so I think we are setting all the 3 in the right way. We also checked we imported correctly the library resource bundle that youre asked to import in the project  and that contains the CoreData models, the library throws a particular exception when its missing too so it should have been done correctly.  p  pIm not a CoreData expert so I would like to know what could cause that exception and what should I check, or if there are any known issues building a module with a third party library that uses CoreData.p  pAny help appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 3849 pI am automating a scenarioselenium where i need to enter credentials in Authentication Pop up, which is generated by the APP. I am using java Robot class to perform this function, it runs fine when i run it from my local machine which is a Windows Platform, but it doesnt seem to work when i trigger the build from jenkins. It hangs at a point where you need to enter the Credentials in Authentication Pop up. I think This is because the jenkins slave is an Unix Platform and this has something to do with the cross platform issue. As i am not sure if Unix Supports the Robot class.br     Can somebody suggest me a workaround for this problem  Thanks in advancep

Negative 3849 pIm new to Leaflet and am wondering how it deals with missing values. Suppose I have a data frame with many columns, holding coordinates and other attributes. Ideally, if the codeaddCircleMarkerscode function comes upon a missing latitude or longitude value, it would skip it and not plot that rows coordinates. However, what Ive been encountering it that if theres a single missing latitudelongitude value, no points at all will be drawn. p  pI can imagine going row by row in my data and checking for any NAs, and only plotting if there are none.

Negative 3849 pHow can you distinguish between MSYS and MSYS2 and CYGWIN, e.g via a command or a predefined environment variablep  pThis distinction would be needed by tools like Scons to adapt generated command lines, e.g. by issuing double backslashed codecpathtofilecode or backticked codecygpath w cpathtofilecode. p  pBackground MSYS allows codeCpathtofilecode, while MSYS2 only allows codecpathtofilecode or double backslashed codecpathtofilecode. Scons generates the codecpathtofilecode on MSYS2, but codecsccode Microsofts C compiler and other tools only allow Windows style paths.p

Negative 3849 pSo, I had a PostgreSQL database and I decided to migrate it into MongoDB to increase performance. I ended up building the following modelp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comoaCA0.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoaCA0.png altenter image description hereap  pTwo main documents, Departamento and Distribuidora. Inside Departamento, I have an array called Funcionarios, which represents the employees that work inside of this department. p  pInside Distribuidora, however, the situation is a little more complicated. I have an array of pairs of documents, which represent a product and the city in which they are distributed. This used to be a ternary relationship in my RDBMS, so its important to know which strongpairsstrong of products and cities are related to a Distribuidora document. If that wasnt enough, every product has an ID that references a Departamento document departamentoid.p  pMy problem here is that this model lacks in performance optimisation. To do complex queries in elements inside the arrays I have to do repeated unwind operations, and I also have to be pivoting data in order to get information from both collections, so the queries end up being terribly slow.p  pTherefore, I want to strongdenormalisestrong this model as much as I can, preferably in a single document without arrays, but I just cant think of a proper way to do it. Can some please help me in this troublesome task Thanks a lot in advance.p

Negative 3849 pIm writing a function codeeliminatechar str, int charactercode that takes a cstring and a character to eliminate as input, scans codestrcode for instances of codecharactercode and replaces the value at the current index with... what I thought codeNULLcode, but this seems risky and could mess with other functions that rely on the nullterminator in a cstring. For examplep  precodechar eliminatechar str, int character      if str return str      int index  0     while str[index]        if str[index]  character           str[index]  0 THIS LINE IS IN QUESTION     return str  codepre  pMy question is, how do I properly implement this function such that Im effectively eliminating all instances of a specified character in a string And if a proper elimination assigns code0code to the character to be replaced, how does this not affect the entire string i.e., it effectively ends at the first code0code encountered. For example, if I were to run the above function twice on the same string, the second call would only examine the string up to where the last character was replaced. p
Negative 3849 pI have three GUI buttons for certain actions in a game. The player can show Empathy, Pity or Tough Love to a Hostage Taker to manipulate them. What I plan to do is to press the GUI button for Empathy, for example, and have it raise an OnEmpathy event. This OnEmpathy event will then notify each HostageTaker class that the player has shown Empathy and they react accordingly. Now, for some code examples.p  precodepublic class HostageTaker     public void OnEnable      ButtonHandler.OnEmpathy  this.EmpathyControl This statement here is where EmpathyControl SHOULD subscribe to the OnEmpathy event.     MonoBehaviour.printDebug  public void EmpathyControl      Game related actions here  codepre  pThe OnEnable event triggers instantly, as soon as the HostageTaker is put into a level, so what I believe would happen is that as soon as any HostageTaker is added to a level, theyll automatically subscribe to the OnEmpathy event with this line codeButtonHandler.OnEmpathy  this.EmpathyControlcodep  pNow, the ButtonHandler script p  precodepublic class ButtonHandler  NegotiationControls  public delegate void EmpathyCall public static event EmpathyCall OnEmpathy  public void OnMouseDown       if this.name  Empathy ampamp OnEmpathy  null Button identification amp null event check.              printEmpathy Called.         OnEmpathy          else ifthis.name  Pity              printPity Called.          else ifthis.name  Tough Love              printTough Love Called.          else              printCall error. Cannot identify button or OnEmpathy is Null.       codepre  pNow, at this point, EmpathyControl should be subscribed to OnEmpathy in the Button Handler script. I plan to implement some actual event parameters so that I wont have to manually identify each button using strings, but for now, it works. Pity and Tough Love seem to trigger their Debug print statements as I would expect, but Empathy doesnt trigger, instead resorting to the else condition. p  pThat means, naturally, that OnEmpathy is null. The only question is, why Ive subscribed the EmpathyControl method to the event in the ButtonHandler script, and Ive definitely instantiated a HostageTaker in the TestLevel script that runs as soon as the first level starts. The only problem is that TestLevels only HostageTaker doesnt seem to subscribe to OnEmpathy properly.p  pstrongLevelTest scriptstrongp  precodepublic class LevelTest1  MonoBehaviour   public HostageTaker HT1  new HostageTaker  void Start        HT1.customName  Debug  codepre
