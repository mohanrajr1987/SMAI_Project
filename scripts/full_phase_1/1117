Positive 1117 pIn my XAML Ive got a ListBox which is bound to a list of viewmodel objects.   p  pA usercontrol is defined to use this TestViewModel as its data context. In the usercontrol Ive got 2 command buttons which are bound to methods using ICommand pattern. With the help these buttons Im able to add and remove viewmodels to the above mentioned list, which makes the ListBox to grow in height which makes the scrollbars to appear.p  pEverything seems to be working fine. However, things dont work as the expected way, when the usercontrols are partially shown because of the screenapplication height is not enough.p  pEven though commands buttons are visible, the commands are not getting fired. Instead, The ListBox is getting scrolled to the last item and the partially shown item becomes fully visible. After that the commands for that item is getting fired as expected.p  pSetting a fixed height for the ListBox is not an option, as the application has to support different screen resolutions.p  pAnybody has any idea how to fix this Or is this an expected behaviorp  pstrongUpdatestrong Adding the sample source codes.

Negative 1117 pI would like to implement something similar to a c delegate method in PHP.  A quick word to explain what Im trying to do overall  I am trying to implement some asynchronous functionality.  Basically some resourceintensive calls that get queued, cached, and dispatched when the underlying system gets around to it.  When the asynchronous call finally receives a response I would like a callback event to be raised.p  pI am having some problems coming up with a mechanism to do callbacks in PHP.  I have come up with a method that works for now but I am unhappy with it.  Basically it involves passing a reference to the object and the name of the method on it that will serve as the callback taking the response as an argument and then use eval to call the method when need be.  This is suboptimal for a variety of reasons, is there a better way of doing this that anyone knows of p

Negative 1117 pI am building a dedicated project for all the unit tests of our main project, since including them in the main project would put a strain on an already huge codebase.

Negative 1117 pAssume I own some open source project with no license information. Furthermore, assume nobody has contributed publicly yet and so I own the projects source code and copyright.p  ol lipSay the source code is already hosted online. If I decide to give it an open source license by uploading the associated COPYING document to the repository and adjusting the source files accordingly, will the previous versions of the project become licensed as well Or will the current and future versions be protected while previous versions fall under public domainpli lipAlternatively, say I start a new project using a DVCS e.g. Mercurial on my local machine. I commit all my changes locally and then add license information in a later changeset. If I were to host the projectrepository, will the entire history be licensed or only the versions following that changesetpli ol  pIn 2, the project is initially not hosted so this does not seem like a problem. But once its uploaded, some of the projects history will not include the license information, making the result look almost exactly like 1.p  pI ask because Google Code allows you to select a license on a new project, even if you intend to import the repository afterward, making licensing seem somewhat external to the actual source code, whereas bitbucket.org does not.p

Negative 1117 pI will have multiple tables used by different projects on the same mySql server.  Much of the data is sensitive, and needs to be behind permissions wall.  However many of the tables of sensitive data rely on tables of insensitive data for user and department information.  So I see three options ahead of me and I am unsure which one to pick.p  pstrongAll in one database with table level permissionsstrongp  pThe simplest of all solutions except I dont control permissions on the database server, traditionally the server team only does database level permissions and getting them to allow it is a political battle I may not have the influence to win, and keeping track of all the permissions would be a pain.p  pstrongIn multiple databases, with database level permissionsstrongp  pI can split the tables into database zones, so department wide info, like the staff data, can be in its own database and tools that edit the staff data can have UPDATEampINSERT access to the department database.  Other tools would want to access parts of the staff list, the public staff directory have SELECT access to the to the staff tables, but pars of the staff tables would need to remain private, like personal contact info, copy codes, or billing indexes.  I would need to split the staff tables into public or private tables, but I would be stuck with table level permissions again.  So I would need to split the department database into the department shared and the department private databases.p  pstrongCross database viewsstrong I would create views in a database that pulls data from other databases that the account does not have access to.  So I can put all the staff information in the department database, then create a view in the web database that only pulls the columns that should be publicly available name, department, extension.  This would allow me to, in effect, have column level SELECT rights without having to muck about with permissions.  My concern would be speed.  The original table the data is being pulled from would be fully indexed but the documentation seems contradictory whether or not the columns would be indexed when querying the view.p  pHas anyone else used any of these three options  Do you have better ones that I havent thought of  What are the pitfalls you can see beyond what I have pointed out for any of the optionsp

Negative 1117 pI just spent a whole week tracking down and whacking memory leaks over the head, and I arrived on the other end of that week a little dazed. emThere has to be a better way to do this,em is all I can think, and so I figured it was time to ask about this rather heavy subject.p  pThis post turned out to be rather huge. Apologies for that, though I think in this case, explaining the details as thoroughly as possible is warranted. Explicitly so, because it gives you the whole picture of all the things I did to find this bugger, which was a lot. This bug alone took me roughly three 10 hour days to track down...p  pstrongWhen I hunt leaksstrongp  pWhen I hunt leaks I tend to do it in phases, where I escalate deeper into the problem if its not solvable in an earlier phase. These phases begin with Leaks telling me theres an issue.p  pIn this particular case which is an example the bug is solved Im not asking for answers to solving this bug, Im asking for ways to improve the process in which I emfindem the bug, I am finding a leak two, even in a multithreaded application which is fairly large, especially including the 3 or so external libraries Im using in it unzip feature and http server. So lets see the process where I fix this leak.p  pstrongPhase 1 Leaks tells me theres a leakstrongp  pimg srchttpenrogue.comsoleaks.png altLeaks with 2 GeneralBlock160 leaks at 160 bytes in Foundations NSPushAutoreleasePoolp  pWell, thats interesting. Since my app is multithreaded, my first thought is that I forgot to put an codeNSAutoreleasePoolcode in somewhere, but after checking in all the right places, this is strongnotstrong the case. I take a look at the stack trace.p  pstrongPhase 2 The stack tracestrongp  pimg srchttpenrogue.comsoleaksextendeddetail.png altThe stack trace for the leakp  pBoth of the codeGeneralBlock160code leaks have identical stack traces which is odd since I have it grouped by identical backtraces, but anyway, which start at codethreadassigndefaultcode and end at codemalloccode under codeNSAPDataCreatecode. In between, there is absolutely nothing that correlates to my app. Not a single of those calls are mine. So I do some Googling around to figure out what these might be used for.p  pFirst we have a number of methods which obviously have to do with a thread callback, such as POSIX thread calls going into NSThread calls. p  pAt 86 in this inverted stack trace, we have code[NSThread exit]code followed by codepthreadexitcode and codepthreadexitcode which is interesting, but in my experience I cant really tell if its indicative of some specific case or if its simply how things go.p  pAfter that we have a thread cleanup method called codepthreadtsdcleanupcode  whatever tsd stands for Im not sure, but regardless, I move on.p  pAt 43 we havep  precodeCATransactionreleasethreadvoid CAPushAutoreleasePool codepre  pInteresting. We have codeCore Animationcode here. That, Ive learned the very hard way, means that Im probably doing codeUIKitcode calls from a background thread, which I must not. The big question is where, and how. While it may be easy to say thou shalt not call codeUIKitcode from ye olde background thread, its not as easy to know what exactly constitutes as a codeUIKitcode call. As youll see in this case, its far from obvious. p  pThen 21 turn out to be way too low level to be of any real use. I think.p  pI still have no clue where to even begin looking for this memory leak. So I do the only thing I can think of.p  pstrongPhase 3 codereturncode galorestrongp  pPropose we have a call tree that looks something like thisp  precodeApp start      Some init          A init   B init  Other case  Fourth case                         Some case            Third case         Fifth case    ... codepre  pRough outline of an apps lifecycle, that. In short, we have a number of paths the app can take depending on whatever happens, and each of these paths comprise of a bunch of code being called in various places. So I pull out the scissors and start chopping. I start close towards App start initially, and slowly move down the line towards crossroads, where I only allow one path.p  pSo I havep  precode ... [fooClass doSomethingAwesomewithThisCoolThing]  ... codepre  pAnd I dop  precode ... return [fooClass doSomethingAwesomewithThisCoolThing]  ... codepre  pAnd then install the app on the device, close it down, alttab to Instruments, hit cmdR, hammer on the app like a monkey, look for leaks, and after maybe 10 cycles if theres nothing, I conclude that the leak is further down the code. Possibly in codefooClasscodes codedoSomethingAwesomecode or below the call to codefooClasscode.p  pSo I move that return one step below the call to codefooClasscode and test again. If the leak doesnt appear now, great, codefooClasscode is innocent.p  pThere are a few issues with this method.p  ol liMemory leaks tend to be a bit snobbish about when to reveal themselves. You need romantic music and candles, so to say, and cutting one end of in one place sometimes results in the memory leak deciding not to appear at all. I often had to go embackem because the leak had appeared after I added, say, this line codeUIImage acode which obviously isnt leaking by itselfli liIts excruciatingly slow and tiring to do for a big program. Especially if you end up having to back up again.li liIts hard to keep track of. I kept putting in code 17 14.48.25 3 leaks  RSx10code which in English meant July 17th, 1448.25 3 leaks occured when I repeatedly selected the item 10 times sprinkled throughout the entire app. Messy, but at least it let me see clearly where Id tested things and what the results were.li ol  pThis method eventually took me down to the very bottom of a class which handled thumbnails. The class had two methods, one which initialized things and then did a code[NSThread detachThreadWithSeparator]code call to a separate method which processed the actual images and put them into the individual views after scaling them down to the right size.p  pIt was sort of like thisp  precode no leaks if I return here [NSThread detachNewThreadSelectorselectorloadThumbnails toTargetself withObjectnil]  leaks appear if I return here codepre  pBut if I went into codeloadThumbnailscode and stepped down through it, the leaks would disappear and appear in a very random fashion. At one extensive run, I would have leaks and if I moved the return statement down below e.g. codeUIImage small, bloatedcode I would have leaks appearing. In short, it was very erratic.p  pAfter some more testing, I realized that leaks would tend to appear more often if I reloaded things quicker while in the app. After many hours of pain, I realized that if this external thread did not finish executing before I loaded another session thus creating a second thumbnail class and discarding this one, the leak would appear.p  pThats a nice clue. So I added a codeBOOLcode called codeworldExistscode which was set to codeNOcode as soon as a new session was initiated, and then started sprinkling codeloadThumbnailscodes codeforcode loop withp  precodeif worldExists [action] if worldExists [action 2]  ... codepre  pand also made sure to exit the loop as soon as I found out that codeworldExistscode. But the leak remained.p  pAnd the codereturncode method was showing leaks in very erratic places. Randomly, it appeared. p  pSo I tried adding this at the very top of codeloadThumbnailscodep  precodefor int i  0 i lt 50 ampamp worldExists i      [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval0.1f]  return codepre  pAnd believe it or not, but the leaks actually appeared if I loaded a new session within 5 seconds.p  pFinally, I put a breakpoint in codedealloccode for the thumbnail class. The stack trace for this looked like thisp  precode0  [Thumbs dealloc] self0x162ec0, cmd0x32299664 at UsersmeDocumentsmyappClassesThumbs.m28 1  0x32c0571a in [NSObject release]  2  0x32b824d0 in NSFinalizeThreadData  3  0x30c3e598 in pthreadtsdcleanup  4  0x30c3e2b2 in pthreadexit  5  0x30c3e216 in pthreadexit  6  0x32b15ffe in [NSThread exit]  7  0x32b81d16 in NSThreadmain  8  0x30c8f78c in pthreadstart  9  0x30c85078 in threadstart  codepre  pWell... that doesnt look too bad.

At this point, I was emstillem clueless, believe it or not, but I finally figured out what was going on.p  pThe problem is the following when I do code[NSThread detachNewThreadSelector]code in the thumbnail loader, codeNSThreadcode retains the object until the thread runs out. In the case where the thumbnail loading doesnt finish before I load another session, all of my retains on the thumbnail loader are released, but since the thread is still running, codeNSThreadcode keeps it alive. p  pAs soon as the thread returns from codeloadThumbnailscode, codeNSThreadcode releases it, it hits 0 retain and goes straight into codedealloccode... emwhile still in the background threadem. p  pAnd when I then call code[super dealloc]code, codeUIViewcode obediently tries to remove itself from its superview, which is a codeUIKitcode call on a background thread. Consequently a leak occurs.p  pThe solution I came up with to solve this was to wrap the loader in two other methods. I renamed it to codeloadThumbnailscode and then did the followingp  precode[self retain]  lt added this before the detaching [NSThread detachNewThreadSelectorselectorloadThumbnails toTargetself withObjectnil]   added these two new methods  voiddoneLoadingThumbnails      [self release]  voidloadThumbnails      [self loadThumbnails]     [self performSelectorOnMainThreadselectordoneLoadingThumbnails withObjectnil waitUntilDoneNO]  codepre  pAll that said and I said a lot  sorry about that, the big question is stronghow do you figure these oddball things out without going through all of the abovestrong p  pWhat reasoning did I miss in the above process At what point did emyouem realize where the problem was What were the redundant steps in my method Can I skip phase 3 codereturncode galore somehow, or cut it down, or make it more efficientp  pI know this question is, well, vague and huge, but this whole concept is vague and huge. Im not asking you to teach me how to find leaks I can do that... its just very, very painful, Im asking what people tend to do to cut down on the process time. Asking people how do you find leaks is impossible, because there are so many different kinds. But the one type I tend to have issues with is the one that looks like the above, with no calls inside your actual app. p  pWhat process do you use to more efficiently track it downp

Negative 1117 pI have an ASP.NET website and from one of the web pages I need to generate a PDF document that contains the output of a set of web pages that the user selects. I call it embatch PDFem. Basically, the user is asked to choose which web pages she needs to put into the PDF and then clicks a button which creates a PDF with all the selected web pages in it.p  pTo do that, I send the list of selected pages their IDs via query string and, on the server, for each web page ID in the query string, it generates an http request to the localhost and gets the pages PDF from this request i have codeRequest.Filtercode that does conversion from HTML to PDF. Then it combines all PDF streams into a single PDF and dumps it into the response stream. Everything works.p  pBut i would like to do it using AJAX. Currently, a new browser window opens and the user has to wait for the server to finish before she can see the page. Instead, I would like to send an AJAX request and, when PDF generation has completed, to show the PDF.p  pOne way to do this is to write the PDF into a file on the server when AJAX sends a request and then redirect to this file, but is there a way to avoid messing with files For example, can i put the entire PDF into the session Any other ideasp  pThanks.p

Negative 1117 pI have a classic ASP.NET app .NET 3.5 with a pretty standard coderunatservercode style form with serverside controls and an Execute codeaspbuttoncode. In the codebehind, the codeexecuteButtonclickcode handler processes some of the other controls, runs a report, and drops the result into an codeasplabelcode. So the effect of pressing the Execute button is that the entire page reloads with the report inserted into the label.p  pI need to change this so that when the Execute button is pressed, the report pops up in a new window with a different layout ie without the controls and form. If I was doing this in an MVC framework I would just change the view template in the execute action, so the analogue for ASP.NET would be change the code in front, ie the .aspx file that gets used, from the codebehind class.p  pIs this possible I know the link between the .aspx and the .aspx.cs isnt extremely tight as it is possible to reuse a codebehind class in multiple .aspx files. So can I set the .aspx file to render from the codebehindp

Negative 1117 pId like to know if there is a way to know if the content provider of callings has changed. I mean, if I make a call, or I answer a call, it returns a flag that a new log has been added to the call log, or the place where Android store informations about callings.p  pBecause, when I make a call, Android stores the number, the contact name if exists, the hour of the calling, the duration, ..., all in the content provider. So is there a way to capture this flag that says the content provider of callings is bigger, I mean, that a new data has been inserted on the content provider CallLog.Calls.p  pSo, I still have a lot of doubts related to this issue. I dont know where to register the content observer. My intention is, when something changes in the CallLog content provider, the insert method of the code will be used. p  pI mean, the code wont do anything unless new data has been added to the CallLog content provider. If some data has been added to the CallLog content provider, then the code will query the new data, and then will insert.

Negative 1117 pI am using Visual Studio 2010 Express on Windows 7. I recently installed GitExtension and it seems to work fine cloning and branching and what not.

Negative 1117 pI am using WebClients DownloadFileAsync in C method to download files asynchronously. I have event handlers attached to DownloadProgressChanged and DownloadFileCompleted events. I hoped to get notified of any errors through AsyncCompletedEventArgss Error property in the DownloadFileCompleted event handler.

But if the connection drops while the download is in progress nothing happens. The event handler is not called, it keeps waiting forever. What should I do to handle such a scenario  Thanks.p

Negative 1117 pi am new with cake but ive somehow managed to get through so far. After ive figured out that html2pdf is a convienient way to produce pdf documents out of Cakephp, ive installed html2pspdf and after some minor problems it worked. So now i am coming now to the point that if i dont modify my controllers beforeRender function likep  precodefunction beforeFilter      parentbeforeFilter     thisgtAuthgtallowdownload,view  codepre  pi just see my loginpage in the pdf ive created. Setting within my beforeRender function the  thisAuthallow value opens obviously erveryone the way to get a perfect pdf without being authorized. The whole controller looks like thisp  precodeltphp  class DashboardController extends AppController      var name  Dashboard     var uses  arrayAircrafts,Trainingplans,                        Fstds,Flights,Properties,Person                 function beforeFilter       parentbeforeFilter      thisgtAuthgtallowdownload,view          function view         set layout for print                thisgtlayout  pdf                change layout for browser        ifgt issetthisgtparams[named][print]       thisgtlayout  dashboard        aircrafts        thisgtAircraftsgtrecursive  0       aircrafts thisgtAircraftsgtfindall       thisgtsetaircrafts,aircrafts  .... and so on....        thisgtsetpersonproperties,personproperties          function downloadid  null        downloadlink  dashboardviewprint1        Include Component       AppimportComponent, Pdf        Make instance       Pdf  new PdfComponent        Invoice name output name       Pdfgtfilename  dashboard . dateM         You can use download or browser here       Pdfgtoutput  download       Pdfgtinit        Render the view       PdfgtprocessRouterurl, true . downloadlink       thisgtrenderfalse       gt codepre  pSo in my opinion the Pdfprocess call gets the data by calling more or less the view, but this process is not logged in, or in other words not authorized to get the data i want to render into the pdf. So the question is now how to get it done by not opening my application to everyone.p  pBest regards, cdjwp

Negative 1117 pWhen Entity Framework generates an ObjectContext for a two database tables lets say Table1 and Table2 connected with a manytomany relationship table, it doesnt create an object for the xref table, opting instead for collection properties on either end of the relationship.

Negative 1117 pI have a little problem with my RIAenabled SL application. p  pstrongTHE BACKGROUNDstrongp  pThe relevant part looks like thisp  ul lipWhen any data operation i.e. load, submit, login etc. is in place, then a BusyOverlay control which I wrote disables RootVisual and provides a visual effect. When the operation is finished, then it sets RootVisual.IsEnabled to whatever it was before. It works just like ChildWindow when it comes to interaction with RootVisual at least as far as I can tell.pli lipOne of the elements in RootVisual which itself is a UserControl is a hiding menu. It is a border which contains the actual menu. It has two storyboards in Resources which increase and decrease its width  nothing fancy, they are as simple as you can imagine, and the border itself has MouseEnter and MouseLeave handled. The handlers start one of the storyboards, just one line of code. I dont provide any samples because there is nothing interesting going on, it would just bloat the post. If you think it is necessary, just tell me and Ill post the relevant XAML and C code.pli ul  pstrongTHE PROBLEMstrongp  pWhen the RootVisual is disabled, then the Border.MouseLeave event does not fire. When user clicks something in the menu that loads initial data, and then moves the mouse outside the menu, it does not hide. Is there any way to elegantly solve this problem CaptureMouse is out of question it requires mouse left button to be down. All I can think of is to publish an OperationFinished event in my data operation handling static class and handle it in the UserControl which is RootVisual, but I think its ugly and doesnt fit in my architecture. Is there something Im missingp  pIll be grateful for any solutions and suggestions.p

Negative 1117 pI have a WinForms app that contains a combobox comboBoxMain and several other controls.  comboBoxMain is bound to an array of 5 objects instances of a data class that contain several properties and is used to select emwhichem of the 5 objects will have their properties displayed in the other UI controls.  Once the user has selected the desired values in all of the controls on my form, I have a button that will copy those values to each of the other 4 instances of the data class.  A few of the controls on my form can impact the visibility, enableddisabled state or selected value of other controls.  For example, if a user were to select a value of Disabled from one of the comboboxes lets call it comboBoxStatus, that would result in three other controls being disabled, a checkbox being checked and the title of a groupbox being changed.  The problem Im having with this functionality can be described by the following scenariop  ol lipThe user selects a value of Disabled in comboBoxStatus which then triggers code in its SelectionChangeCommitted event handler that modifies the other controls as I described above.pli lipNext, the user clicks the button to copy the currently selected values in all of the controls to the other 4 data objects.pli lipFinally, the user selects one of the other 4 data objects from comboBoxMain.pli ol  pWhen this happens, I have a SelectionChangeCommitted event handler for comboBoxMain that fires and looks at the SelectedValue in comboBoxStatus.  Unfortunately, it sees the default value for the backing property instead of a value of Disabled which was copied to the property earlier.  I have code at the end of comboBoxMainSelectionChangeCommitted which is supposed to check the values of those controls that could impact other things in the UI and make sure that everything gets updated appropriately.  This obviously doesnt happen though, since its not seeing the correct value.  If I move that code out of the event handler and manually call it via a button press after the UI has bound the data for the currently selected data object, then it works.  I can only guess that this happens because the bindings arent updated until after comboBoxMainSelectionChangeCommitted has exitedp  pI hope that all makes sense.  Ive been playing with this for hours and have yet to completely understand whats happening or what the best solution to this problem is.  If youve got any thoughts, Id appreciate hearing them.  Thanks for readingp

Negative 1117 pI recently translated a website into a Rails I18n YAML file and the file itself is quite big 30 kbs. Im not sure how the simplebackend is handled, but from my understanding, each instance of the rails application will hash that YAML file into its backend which is stored in memory. It seems like a typical hash array in Ruby can go upwards from 100 bytes in size, so having over 500 translation hash keys with values may amplify the total memory usage quite a bit. Maybe Im being paranoid, but I think it would be better to use another I18n backend such as Redis to store the translations.p  pIs my logic here correct Should I make the changep

This work correctly when the Content property in the Expander is bound to the Title property. You can expand and close items and move them all to the new group.p  pHowever, if I change this to bind to the Content property the line commented out above, which binds to the TextBlock that is created in codebehind the binding works fine to start with expanders can be opened and closed, TextBlock is shown but if you try to move an item that has been expanded, the application dies with an strongArgumentExceptionstrong and a message Value does not fall within the expected range.p  pAm I trying to do something that is not supported binding the content to a usercontrol created in codebehind, am I setting binding up incorrectly or is something else wrong.p  pNOTE I am really hoping to get the binding to work with a usercontrol created in codebehind, since creating a full databinding model for our specific usercontrol would be a quite large undertaking.p

Negative 1117 pAn asp.net mostly webforms team I work on has recently decided to make the move from vb.net to c.  The people who used to be on the team who couldnt readwrite C code well had since moved on, and each time we hired a new person it became more of a problem for us to be a vb.net shop.p  pIll save the standard vbc language war stuff and just stick with the one thing that I ran into today.  p  pWith vb.net, when we want to handle some event from some object, we just pick the object out of the list in the upper left, pick the event out of the list on the upper right, and it creates the fully wired up event handler.  Its also very clear that the method is an event handler due to the Handles ...  at the end.p  pIn the C world, it emseemsem we are left with a few poor options.  p  p1 Manually wireup the event by typing the name of the event and event handler in the aspx markup.  Like actually writing OnLoadSomeFunction in the aspx.  EDIT I didnt realize that his only applied to the form and not to any contained controls, so I guess this isnt really an optionp  p2 Using auto wireup events, and naming methods and signatures correctly so that they match up.p  pIm hoping Im missing some other much better option.p  pWith these 2 options that Ive seen so farp  p1 we have to know the event names and event arguments.  We cant just look down the list and be like Oh good this has OnItemClick, I have to go research that in some control documentation.  Likewise Id have to go research the event args to find out that ItemClick needs a RadPanelBarEventArgs as the 2nd parameter.  Wasted time.p  p2 I get no compile check on anything Im doing with regard to connecting events.  If I name the method signature wrong, or if I type it in wrong in the aspx page, everything will compile just fine until runtime when the mismatch will blow things up.  EDIT what I mean is if I type onClickABC and the event handler is really named ABCD this will not be caught at compile time.  With VB, issues with renamingmistyping event handler names are caught at compile time, because of the Handles.  Same goes for if I have onClickABC and this controls onClick really needs a SpecialEventArgs but I accidentally use SomeRegularEventArgsp  pIm hoping we missed something and there is a better way to do this. p

Negative 1117 pIm writing a library in C that I will later use for an application, and I want the library to be as efficient as sanely possible ie. dont overcomplicate things too much to make it more efficient. However, I have this question about how to most efficiently use reflection on a classmethods and to illustrate the question Ive simplified my class a lot down to thisp  precodeclass MyClass      private static Dictionaryltstring, objectgt methods      public void Method1               Do something.           public void Method2               Do something else.       codepre  pNow, what I want is from within the class a private method yet to be created, take a string containing the methodname, then fire the method, simple as that. The easiest way of doing this would be to just look at the name, get a method with that name, and execute it, but that forces me to use reflection a lot of times. This private method can potentially be called thousands or tens of thousands of times, and it need to be quick. So I came up with two possible solutions. As you can probably see Ive added a static dictionary containing stringobject replacing object with actual type, just wrote object cause that works with both my examples. Then Id add a static constructor that goes trough the class and adds all the methodinfos to the methodsdictionary. And then comes the question, on creation of a new instance of the class, should I create bound delegates to the methods and put those in a nonstatic private dict, or should I simply fire the methods using the MethodInfo in the methodsdictionaryp  pThe average usecase will create 10 instances of this class, and have 1000 calls to the method that should fire either Method1 or Method2 depending on its stringargument and no, switchcase is not an option because of the extensibility of the class, as said, this was a simplified version. What would be the most efficient way of achieving thisp

Negative 1117 pSo, I figure I could probably come up with some wacky solution, but i figure i might as well ask up front. p  peach user can have many orders. br each desk can have many orders. br each order has maximum 3 items in it.br p  ptrying to set things up so a user can create an order and the order auto generates a reference number and each item has a reference letter. reference number is 099 and loops back around to 0 once it hits 99, so orders throughout the day are easy to reference for the desks. p  pSo, user places an order for desk 2 of 3 itemsbr 78A red staplerbr 78B pencilsbr 78C a kangaroo footbrp  pnot sure if this would be done in the program logic or done at the SQL level somehow. p  pwas thinking something like neworder  order.last  1 and somehow tying that into a range on order create. pretty fuzzy on specifics. p

Negative 1117 pI am using snortinline and I forwarded all the packets using  iptables to the QUEUE so that snortinline can pick them up for  inspection and dropalert depending on the rules.  But does Snort when run in inline mode take in packets from iptables  too What is the difference between Snort and Snortinline when it  comes to blocking packets   I observe that when I run Snort without using iptables, somehow my  packets are getting dropped.

Negative 1117 pI have a single thread server process that watches few around 100 sockets via epoll in a loop, my question is that how to decide the optimum value of epollwait timeout value, since this is a single threaded process, everything is triggered off epollwait , if there is no activity on sockets, program remains idle, my guess is that if i give too small timeout, which causes too many epollwait calls there is no harm because even though my process is doing too many epollwait calls, it would be sitting idle otherwise, but there is another point, I run many other processes on this 8 core box, something like 100 other process which are clients to this process, I am wondering how timeout value impacts cpu context switiching, i.e if i give too small timeout which results in many epollwait call will my server process be put in waiting many more times vs when I give a larger timeout value which results in fewer epollwait calls.p  pany thoughtsideas.p  pThanksp

When client wants to communicate with server, it checks which pipe is available from shared memory then opens that pipe amp sends its message on that pipe, respective worker thread of server servers this client request. That worker thread sends request status Successfailure on that pipe so that client will become aware of last operation status.p  pAs far as I know, pipes on Mac os x are unidirectional amp they lack capability of creating unlimited instances like Windows.p  pWhat mechanism could be best suited for such kind of communicationp  pThanks, Vaibhav.p

Negative 1117 pI have a resume that Im trying to translate from MS Word into HTML and CSS for easier maintenance and sharing. I like the style of the resume, and would prefer to keep it. It has a left column, with titles like Education, Experience, etc. in bold, and rightaligned against a vertical separator.p  pIn Word this is achieved by a table, with the style of the central border set to solid, and the other borders set to blank. This allows the section titles to be vertically aligned with the associated content.p  pI tried to simply duplicate this technique, but in Firefox and Chrome, if I set a column of tds borderright attributes to solid, there are gaps at the vertical divisions of the table. This sort of ruins the effect.p  pI thought of using two divs, one with the headings and one with the content, but other than hardcoding pixel heights which has its own obvious sets of problems, I cant figure out how to keep them vertically insync.p  pIs there a way to do this without losing the ability to keep the titles and their associated content  vertically alignedp  pThe table code looks something likep  precodelttablegt lttrgtlttd styleborderright1px solid blackgtEducationlttdgtlttdgt [Name of School, etc.]lttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttd styleborderright1px solid blackgtExperiencelttdgtlttdgt[Work experience]lttdgtlttrgt . . . lttablegt codepre  pp

As soon as it tries rendering codectreecode treeview it starts throwing all kind of script errors, specifically it ignores loadCategories says not found. So far I think what is happening is the ajax loaded partial page that contains the treeview is reloading the jquery lib destroying all old bindings and functions in the script. Is there a way to make this work, two treeviews on one page, one previously loaded, one in a ajax loaded partial view, both binding to separate datap

Negative 1117 pIm building an MVC3 application using the Entity Framework. In the application my controllers talk to a service layer. One of the controllers is a codeTournamentControllercode which uses the codeTournamentServicecode. This service has some standard methods such as codeCreateTournamentcode, codeUpdateTournamentcode etc.p  pWhen I want to insert a new tournament I want the view to have a dropdownlist of possible sports for which the tournament can be organised. So in the codeTournamentControllerscode codeCreatecode method I fill the codeViewBag.Sportscode with a list of possible sports. Now to obtain this list of sports I use codetournamentService.GetAllSportscode. In this codeGetAllSportscode method of the codeTournamentServicecode I want to create an instance of the codeSportServicecode so I can forward the question to the right service.p  pAll services use dependency injection in the constructor to inject their own repository, like sop  precodeprivate ITournamentRepository repo  public TournamentServiceITournamentRepository repo      repo  repo  codepre  pMy codeGetAllSportscode method in the codeTournamentServicecode looks like thisp  precodepublic IEnumerableltSportgt GetAllSports      ISportService sportService  new SportService     return sportService.GetSports  codepre  pThe problem is that by calling the codenew SportServicecode it expects me to hand it an codeISportRepositorycode like in the codeTournamentServicecode, where ninject creates the codeTournamentRepositorycode. Now I could do the followingp  precodepublic IEnumerableltSportgt GetAllSports      ISportService sportService  new SportServicenew SportRepository     return sportService.GetSports  codepre  pBut the problem with that is that each repository expects an IContext, which is normally handled by ninject as well. Furthermore, I dont want two separate contexts to be instantiated.p  pA possible solution I found myself is to do thisp  precodeprivate ITournamentRepository repo private ISportService sportService  public TournamentServiceITournamentRepository repo, ISportService sportService      repo  repo     sportService  sportService  codepre  pBut theres only one method in my codeTournamentServicecode class that would actually use the codesportServicecode so I figure this is a bit overkill to make it a class attribute.p
Negative 1117 pIve got 3 modules A, B, C and a parent P with several interrelated dependencies. p  pNote that none of these projects package as JARs by default.p  pA needs to package B and C and thus has a dependency declared on them of type compile and thats fine. p  pB requires at compile time some of the source that lives within C. My question is really regarding how this is best accomplished.p  pI see two optionsp  pOption 1 Create a 4th project, D, that holds the shared source and packages as a JAR, and declare a dependency in B on D of type provided, so that the source is available at compile time but is not packaged. p  pCreate a dependency in C on D, with a type of compile, such that the source is included in D. This replicates in the resultant artifacts the same structureincludes that the original project set up would have had. p  pHowever it means splitting up the source and having an extra somewhat superfluous for my particular purposes module. p  pOption 2 Using the maven install plugin and the install lifecycle phase, have C install into the local repository as a JAR and declare a dependency in B on Cs JAR  so that the source is pulled out of the local repository and not from a sibling module.p  pI dont mind in this case that B would get access to extra source from C that it might not need. p  pOption 3 p  pIm pretty new to Maven so im not sure on the feasability of option 2 or even if itd be good practice can you install something thats packaged as a WAR locally as a JAR. Would this method break from convention, or is there a better wayp  pMy other concern is that this would mean that youd have to call maven install from P, as maven package would not install the dependency and so the build would fail. p  pAny guidance on this would be greatp  pThanksp

Negative 1117 pI have an application which uses some external library for analytics. Problem is that I suspect it does some things synchronously, which blocks my thread and makes watchdog kill my app after 10 secs 0x8badf00d code. It is really hard to reproduce I cannot, but there are quite few cases in the wild. p  pIve read some documentation, which suggested that instead creating another thread I should use runloops. Unfortunately the more I read about them, the more confused I get. And the last thing i want to do is release a fix which will break even more things p  pWhat I am trying to achieve isp  pFrom main thread add a task to the runloop, which calls just one function initMyAnalytics. My thread continues running, even if initMyAnalytics gets locked waiting for network data. After initMyAnalytics finishes, it quietly quits and never gets called again so it doesnt loop or anything.p  pAny ideas how to achieve it Code examples are welcome  Regardsp

Negative 1117 pFirst, what I need is  n WebBrowsers, each in its own window doing its own job. The user should be able to see them all, or just one of them or none, and to execute commands on each one. There is a main form, without a browser, this one contains control panel for my application.p  pThe key feautre is, each browser logs on to secured web page and it needs to stay logged in as long as possible. Well, Ive done it, but Im afraid something is wrong with my approach.p  pThe question isp  pIs code below valid, or rather a nasty hack which can cause problemsp  precodeinternal class SessionList  ListltSessiongt       public SessionListServer main          MyRecords.ForEachrecord gt              var st  new System.Threading.Threaddata gt                  var s  new Sessionmain, data as MyRecord                 this.Adds                 Application.Runs                 Application.ExitThread                          st.SetApartmentStateSystem.Threading.ApartmentState.STA             st.Startrecord                     some other uninteresting methods here...   codepre  pWhats going on here Session inherits from Form, so it creates a form, puts WebBrowser into it, and has methods to operate on websites. WebBrowser requires to be run in STA thread, so we provide one for each browser. The most interesting part of it is codeApplication.Runscode. It makes the newly created forms alive and interactive. The next codeApplication.ExitThreadcode is called after browser window is closed and its controls disposed. Main application stays alive to perform the rest of the cleanup job.p  pWhen user select Exit or Shutdown option  first the browser threads are ended, so codeApplication.ExitThreadcode is called. It all works, but everywhere I can read about main GUI thread  and here  Ive created many GUI threads. I handle communication between main form and my new forms sessions with threadsafe methods using codeInvokecode. It all works, so is it right or is it wrongp  pIs everything right with using codeApplication.Runcode more than once in one application  An ugly hack or a normal practice This code dies if I start a WebBrowser from the session form thread. It beats me why. It works however if I start WebBrowser by changing its codeUrlcode property from any other thread. Id like to know more what is really happening in such application. But most of all  Id like to know if my idea of applications in application is OK.p  pIm not sure what exactly does codeApplication.Runcode do. Without it forms created in new threads were dead unresponsive. How is it possible I can call codeApplication.Runcode many times It seems to do exactly what it should, but it seems a little undocumented feature to me. Im almost sure, that the crashes are caused by WebBrowser component itself since its not completely managed and native. But maybe its something else.p

The upstream system is supposed to use UTF16. My guess is that the servlet is assuming UTF8 and therefore is reading twice the number of characters it should be. For the message TEST3 please ignore the first byte of each character is code00code.

Negative 1117 pI am currently using OmniAuth for its CAS strategy which is the default method of authentication in my app. I want to provide an additional method of authentication with username and password through the OmniAuth Identity strategy. I have read in its documentation that it is meant to be used with a separate model and not the existing model but I was wondering if it would break if I tried pointing it to the existing current model. p  pThe reason why I want to do it like this is that my app depends on the user filling out a registration form that populates the User model. Currently the CAS strategy just authenticates the user and signs them in if they already exist in the database and points them to usersnew where they fill out their information. p  pIf I were to implement OmniAuth Identity I would require new users to fill out a form with their username and password first to authenticate them and then redirect them to the User model form. If I were a user this would annoy me. I know it would be a onetime thing only but I would like to avoid it if possible. Is there a good way of combining these two steps somehowp  pI know that Devise stores password info in the current User model but it is more feature heavy than I need it to be so I would prefer to stick with OmniAuth.p  pSorry if the answer is obvious I am pretty new to rails.p

Negative 1117 pIs there a way I can write C code to write the structure of an SQL table and the contents of its data to text files  So far I figured out how to use BCP to copy the data, but Im not sure how to copy the table creation script using C. p  pAm I going down the right path or is there a better way to do this  I basically want to automate the table backup scripts that can be created in SQL server. The ideal output would be two sql files.  One that creates the table and one that populates the data.  BCP data isnt in SQL format so you cant just execute it in SQL server which is what I want, this just will make it more user friendly for the people I work for.p

Negative 1117 pIve worked a lot with v3 recently, and if you noticed, beside usual compression that is done on scripts local variable renaming, white space removal, etc., the API script is pushed forward on this, and also has classes and their methods renamed with 2 character names. Also Ive noticed other strange things, like the names that are exposed to the API users are stored as variables and used inside the script. In my opinion, I think there is also some sort of obfuscation intended.p  pDont know if I made myself clear, or if this is some sort of compression that I didnt get right, but I think you get the point.p  pIm interested if someone knows if this is something like a public utility that compresses scripts in such a way, or if someone could point out some references that might help.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1117 pIm playing video via MediPlayer in my android application and have SeekBar displayed. Now I want this seeks bar to automatically update as the video progresses so it should automatically move from left to right. At the moment, code below the bar updates and this is done via running thread, that every second updates the progress of seekBar. The problem is it is not smooth and as seekBar is updated via its seekProgress the video stops for split second and all is very jumpy. Now I would like it to have updated more often then every second as well as keep functionality that I already implemented to allow user to tap on the bar and change progress of the video.p  pIm after something like Android MediaPLayer application have, seekBar is on transparent background and all is smooth and I have no idea how it is done.p  pNo, currently as you see from the code below thread updates every second as it sleeps inside f run method. Ive also tried to use handlers to update UI thread, effect was the same. I also extended SeekBar to its own class, had thread there and this was no good either, exactly same effect.p  pIf anyone can explain to me how to solve this problem and how its done with other player appls that would be great.p  precodepublic class FightPlayerActivity extends Activity implements Runnable, OnSeekBarChangeListener, SurfaceHolder.Callback, OnPreparedListener       private MediaPlayer mpnull     private SeekBar seekBar     private Thread progressBarUpdater     private String filePath     private Handler handlernew Handler      Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState              super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         Toast.makeTextthis,Create , 2000.show             public void surfaceChangedSurfaceHolder holder, int format, int width,             int height           TODO Autogenerated method stub            public void onStop              super.onStop          mp.stop         mp.reset         mp.release           public void run              whiletrue                      try                  progressBarUpdater.sleep1000              catch InterruptedException e                   TODO Autogenerated catch block                 e.printStackTrace                          seekBar.setProgressmp.getCurrentPosition               handler does have same effect, so video stops for split second             handler.postDelayedthis, 1000                     public void onStart              super.onStart          setContentViewR.layout.fightplayer          filePathgetIntent.getStringExtrafilename         filePathEnvironment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectoryEnvironment.DIRECTORYDCIMFightAllBJJScoringfilePath          Toast.makeTextthis,filePath, 2000.show          seek bar          seekBarSeekBar findViewByIdR.id.seekbar         seekBar.setOnSeekBarChangeListenerthis          try              SurfaceView svSurfaceView findViewByIdid.videopreview              SurfaceHolder shsv.getHolder             sh.addCallbackthis              sh.setTypeSurfaceHolder.SURFACETYPEPUSHBUFFERS           catch IllegalArgumentException e               TODO Autogenerated catch block             e.printStackTrace          catch SecurityException e               TODO Autogenerated catch block             e.printStackTrace          catch IllegalStateException e               TODO Autogenerated catch block             e.printStackTrace                          public void stopView view              mp.seekTo0         mp.pause           public void pauseView view              mp.pause           public void playView view              mp.start           public void surfaceCreatedSurfaceHolder holder           try              mpnew MediaPlayer             mp.setDataSourcefilePath             mp.setDisplayholder               mp.setOnPreparedListenerthis             mp.setAudioStreamTypeAudioManager.STREAMMUSIC             mp.prepare              handler.removeCallbacksthis              handler.postDelayedthis, 1000           catch IllegalStateException e               TODO Autogenerated catch block             e.printStackTrace          catch IOException e               TODO Autogenerated catch block             e.printStackTrace                      public void surfaceDestroyedSurfaceHolder holder           TODO Autogenerated method stub            public void onPreparedMediaPlayer mediaplayer           mp.start           seekBar.setMaxmp.getDuration           progressBarUpdaternew Threadthis          progressBarUpdater.start           handler.postDelayedthis, 1000           public void onProgressChangedSeekBar sb,int progress,boolean fromUser              Toast.makeTextthis, progress, 2000.show         mp.seekToprogress           public void onStartTrackingTouchSeekBar seekBar           TODO Autogenerated method stub         onProgressChangedseekBar,seekBar.getProgress,true           public void onStopTrackingTouchSeekBar seekBar           TODO Autogenerated method stub            codepre

I found that if I kept a single form for the entire page, caching worked properly, so as I dived in and out editing entities caching seemed to work and improved overall usability.p  pSo the code I have is roughly the following Ive edited it a lot to simplify it for this questionp  precodeusing Html.BeginFormIndex, Home, FormMethod.Post     ltdivgt     Html.TextBoxForm gt m.SearchTerm      ltinput typesubmit nameSearchSubmit valueSearch gt   ltdivgt   lth2gtParentslth2gt   ltdivgt            var parents  Tool.Models.ToolsModelService.SearchParentsModel.SearchTerm        ltdivgt   ltdivgt     lttablegt         lttheadgt            lttrgt              ltthgtParent IDltthgt              ltthgtAttribute 1ltthgt              ltthgtAttribute 2ltthgt              ltthgtActionsltthgt            lttrgt         lttheadgt         lttbodygt           foreach var p in parents                        lttrgt                lttdgtp.IDlttdgt                lttdgtp.Namelttdgt                lttdgtp.Attrib1lttdgt                lttdgtp.Attrib2lttdgt                lttdgt                  ltinput typehidden nameSelectedParent valuep.ID.ToString gt                  ltinput typesubmit nameParentSubmit valueEdit gt                  ltinput typesubmit nameChildrenSubmit valueShow Children gt                lttdgt             lttrgt                     lttbodygt      lttablegt   ltdivgt   ltdivgt     ltbutton typesubmit nameParentSubmit valueAddgtAdd New Parentltbuttongt   ltdivgt   if Model.SelectedParent  null        var children  Tool.Models.ToolModelService.GetChildrenModel.SelectedParent     if children  null ampamp children.Count gt 0            lth2gtChildrenlth2gt       ltdivgt         lttablegt           lttheadgt             lttrgt               ltthgtChild IDltthgt               ltthgtNameltthgt               ltthgtActionltthgt              lttrgt            lttheadgt            lttbodygt            foreach var c in children                          lttrgt                lttdgtc.IDlttdgt                lttdgtc.Namelttdgt                lttdgt                using Html.BeginFormIndex, Home, FormMethod.Post                                   ltinput typehidden nameSelectedChild valuec.ID.ToString gt                   ltinput typesubmit nameChildrenSubmit valueEdit gt                                lttdgt                  lttrgt                        lttbodygt          lttablegt        ltdivgt        ltdivgt          ltinput typesubmit nameMenuItemSubmit valueAddgtAdd new childltbuttongt        ltdivgt           else        lth2gtChildrenlth2gt     ltdivgt       ltpgtSelect a parent to show children forltpgt     ltdivgt    codepre  pIn the codeHomeController.cscode, there is a bunch of code.

Right now I have it working where you can select the font style, font color, and font size and hit preview and it shows you in a box in the dialog what your text will look like. However, I have a button called okay which is supposed to change the highlighted text or the text you are about to type, but I cant figure out how to display those changes on the main window. The .ui files are private and a lot of the already made functions and pointers are the same in every ui file so if I change the ui file to pubic I have to change a whole bunch of things. Can anyway give me a simple answer Im trying to do this with as little confusion as possible.

Negative 1117 pCan anyone tell me under what conditions codeboostasiocodes codeioserviceruncode method will return The documentation a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibsreleasedochtmlboostasioreferenceioservicerunoverload1.html relnofollowdocumentation for codeioserviceruncodea seems to suggest that as long as there is work to be done or handlers to be dispatched, coderuncode wont return. p  pThe reason Im asking this is that we have a legacy https client that contacts a server and executes http POSTs. The separation of concerns in the client is a bit different than what wed like so were changing a few things about it, but were running into problems. p  pRight now, the client basically has a misnamed codeconnectcode call that effectively drives the entire protocol conversation with the server. The codeconnectcode call starts off by creating a codeboostasioiptcpresolvercode object and calling codeasyncresolvecode on it. This starts a chain where new codeasiocode calls are made from within asio callbacks. p  precodevoid connect      mresolver.asyncresolve query, bind ampclientclassresolvecallback, this       thread  new boostthread bind ampboostasioioservicerun, mioservice    void resolvecallback errorcode amp e, resolveriterator i       if e               tcpendpoint  i         msocket.lowestlayer.asyncconnectendpoint, bindampclientclassconnectcallback,this,1,i       void connectcallback errorcode amp e, resolveiterator i       if e               msocket.lowestlayer.asynchandshakeboostasiosslstreambaseclient,             bindampclientclasshandshakecallback,this,1,i       void handshakecallback errorcode ampe       if e              mesg  formathellomessage         httpsend mesg, bindampclientlasshelloresphandler,this,1,2        void httpsend stringstream amp mesg, replyhandler handler       asyncwritemsocket, mrequestbuffer, bindampclientclasswritecompletecallback,this,1,handler  void writecomletecallback errorcode ampe, replyhandler handler       if e              asyncreaduntilmsocket,mreplybuffer,rnrn, bindampclientclasshandlereply,this,handler       ... codepre  pAnyways, this continues through the protocol until the protocol conversation is done. From the code here you can see that while codeconnectcode is running on the main thread, all of the subsequent callbacks and requests are coming back on the worker thread that is created in codeconnectcode. This is working code.p  pWhen I try to break this chain up and expose it via an external interface, it stops working. In particular, Im having the call codehandlehandshakecode call outside of the codeclientclasscode object. Then codehttpsendcode is part of the interface or is called by the external interface and it creates a new worker thread to call ioservicerun. What happens is even though codeasyncwritecode has been called and even though codewritecompletecallbackcode hasnt returned, ioservicerun exits. It exits without error and claims that no handlers were dispatched, but theres still work to be donep  pSo what Im wondering is what is codeioserviceruncodes definition of work Is it a pending request Why is it that codeioserviceruncode never returns during this chain of requests and responses in the existing code, but when I try to start the thread up again and start a new chain, it returns almost immediately before its finished its workp

Negative 1117 pUsing the GoogleEclipse plugin, I have successfully created, built and deployed locally a very basic GWT Web Application.p  pThe thing is Im not a huge fan of the project structure GWT or the GoogleEclipse plugin set up by default. So Im trying to set things up in a way that makes logical sense for me, but that still is able to run in codeDevModecode and deploy locally.p  pSo I created a 2nd project but strongdid notstrong set it up as a Web Application instead I used a normal Java Application. I created my source directories, my codeEntryPointcode implementation codeTestModule implements EntryPointcode, my codeTestModule.gwt.xmlcode, my host page HTML, etc. All the artifacts that I did in the first successful project.p  pBut now I am in codeRun Configurationscode trying to manually set up a run config similar to how the Web Application Wizard created one for me with the first app I built.p  pIn the codeRun Configurations gtgt GWTcode tab it gives me a window where I can add emAvailable Modulesem. When I click the Add button, no matter what I type, it doesnt provide me with an available list of options to choose from.p  pSo I exited out of the codeRun Configurationscode dialog, assuming that I need to set up my project properties differently. So I rightclicked my project, went to codeProperties gtgt Goodle gtgt Web Toolkitcode, and sure enough, see a similar panel that allows me to add Available Modules. It is my embeliefem that if I configure this section correctly, then a list of Available Modules will become available to me when inside the codeRun Configurationscode dialog, and I should be able to continue.p  pHeres what Im seeingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2yKsI.png altenter image description herep  pAny ideas as to how I can configure my project correctly so that this codeAvailable Modulescode dialog actually presents me with options Thanks in advancep  pstrongPlease notestrong I anticipate many answers to be along the lines of emjust use the Web Application wizard, its so much easierem, etc. I understand this and am temporarily accepting the caveats of trying to configure my own GWT app without the help of the plugins Web Application wizard.

Negative 1117 pI have an ASP.NET Controller, that has a function, that simply returns a ContentResult of a WebClient.p  pIn this case, CNN is my testbed, my WebClient, downloads CNN as a string, into its content, and returns the result as an ActionResultContentResult on a controller.p  pIm calling a RenderPartial on this action, to get CNN to display below and to the right of my current content, in its own box.p  pThe problem Im running into, is when you click a link on CNN, it redirects to a relative url sometimes, and that relative url, doesnt exist in my localhost, and wont exist on my web server, thus the link fails.p  pWhen it does redirect to an absolute url, thats also a problem, as the resulting page replaces my .NET shell.p  pWhat I need it to do, is take any URLs that are inside that ContentResult I returned, and if any of those URLs are clicked, pass them back to my .NET application, to be downloaded by the WebClient, and rendered back in that shell.p  pIm aware I could use an IFRAME to do this instead of WebClient, but an IFRAME is impossible in my case, as its restricted by the public API were consuming, its restrictedhas flaws in the framework that API is servicing, and its blocked on some of our client machines, which we have no control over.p  pAlso, the client machines will be off our network, so I cant use an AJAX load, as thatd be XSS.p  pOne idea that I can think of, is basically to create custom routes, with filtersrules, that look for CNN like links, and pass them to my controller, as a parameter then have my controller render my page, and pass those links to the web client.p  pThis would obviously be a lot of work, and not even really sure where to start with it in the routing engine.p  pThe only other thing I can think of that might work, is checking the validity of the URL, by attempting to see if it points to a valid link. If it doesnt point to a valid link, adding CNNs url prefix to it, and seeing if that is then a valid link. But that seems like a lot of work, for a solution that would be a heavy hit on performance, as checking each link on a page like CNN, could be very costly. Also, since Id be running each link twice, thatd be a problem where POST operations were required, as itd essentially run each operation twice, and being that this is a public API Im consuming off a public framework, I wouldnt have control of the source code to safeguard against that.p  pAny other suggestions Is there any way to accomplish what Im trying to do easilyp

Negative 1117 pIve come across a rather interesting occurrence in a WinForms app Im developing. It seems that when I add a DropDownItem to a ToolStripMenuItem, the shortcut key on the parent menu item disappears. And its not just that the shortcut key isnt shown, it no longer registers the keypress at all. If I remove the submenu items, the shortcut key comes back. Surprisingly, everything looks just fine in the designer, this doesnt appear to happen until runtime.p  pMenu In The Designerp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCWkNp.png altDesigner Viewp  pSame menu at runtimep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjgpim.png altRuntime Viewp  pDoes anyone know why this is happening and how I can prevent it And to clarify, clicking on the parent menu carries out different functionality than clicking on the submenu, so moving the shortcut is not sufficient. If I click on the menus manually, all functionality is carried out as expected. It is only the shortcut key that no longer works.p

Another thing  the new root view controller implements the codeltUISplitViewControllerDelegategtcodep  pUPDATE  p  pI found that the method  code voidsplitViewControllerUISplitViewController svc willHideViewControllerUIViewController aViewController withBarButtonItemUIBarButtonItem barButtonItem forPopoverControllerUIPopoverController pccode gets called only after I go from landscape to portrait so that is why I need to rotate the device in order to get the button to show.p  pThe difference between the two delegates is that the first one is added in my codeAppDelegate.mcode and the second one in the codeprepareForSeguecode method, in the old root view controller. The above method gets called for the old root view controller as soon as the app launches.p
Negative 1117 pI am at the very begining stage of designing an inmemory cache in C which will run as a windows service. Once in production, this is expected to hold close to a million objects various types on average. Some cache items can be up to 10MB or more in size. I considered a variety of data sotrage solutions and i have now decided to go for either a DataTable or an SQLite inmemory instance as the cache store. At this point my questions arep  ol liHow do you think the performance of a DataTable will be with this many number of recordsli liDo you think going with an SQLite solution is an overkillSince SQLite is designed as a  database, i may not really want all those database related plumbing activitiesli ol  pPerformance is the highest priority for me.p  pEDITp  pAdding some more specifics.p  ol liThese cache items are not just keyvalue pairs, they have two more as of now properties pinned and locked items, which can affect their availability. Every look up is going to include all the three properties.li liMemcached has been considered, but at this point that is not an option mainly due to our SLA constraints Thats all I can say about it.li liNot all items are of 10MB in size.li liI am pretty sure that many of these items are going to be mere numerical and small string values.li liI believe, availability of RAM is not an issue.li ol  pThanks in advance, James p

Negative 1117 pI have noticed some interesting behavior in Linux with regard to the Memory Usage RES reported by codetopcode.

The pointers to those objects are tracked by either a codestdlistcode, or a codestdvectorcode.

I got back a reasonable list but while trying to rebuild some of them on a specific database I kept receiving errors p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhkclD.png altLock request time out period exceededp  pThe first idea I got is to set the database in single user mode, rebuild the indexes and then bring it back to life. Well that did not help because the database is being populated by a Windows service that ironically uses the same user I am connected with and the only available to me with enough permissions to do so.

I also cannot stop the service while executing my tasks because it is used for many other things.p  pMy question is simple How can I force singleuser mode to force single connection source In other words how to hide the database or eventually the SQL server from the service It will correctly handle the absence as a network issue so I dont have to worry about that part.p

Negative 1117 pI currently in the process of concepting a large single page web application. There will be a lot of components, so a separation of concerns is important to me. The Server is basically a RESTServer with some sugar, like sending Template Code to the client.p  pSo I need to decide which MVC Framework I want to use client side.p  pI really like backbone.js so I want to have a big Framework relying on it.p  pWhat I came over is Marionette.js and Chaplin.js.p  pHas anybody used one or both frameworks and can say a little bit about them Strengths, weaknesses, community behind it or are they basically the samep  pThis should not be a discussion about which is better, just a short feature list, so I can decide better which one to use, because I dont have the time to really get started with both.p

Negative 1117 pJust had a small question. Im trying to make a UIButton appear programatically, which I have to animate. But once the animation gets done, I cant click the button for some reason.p  pI have a CALayer animationLayer as a sublayer of the UIView, and within that animationLayer, I have three CAShapeLayers pathLayers which I use to animate three different path ways as you can see in the diagram below. And within those pathLayers, Im adding three buttons as their respective sublayers so that I can have an animation where the buttons move along the path as the path draws itself. Everything was working good until I tried adding a button as a sublayer of the pathLayer. Now when I click on the button, its supposed to go to a method that logs on the console window Button has been pressed. Ive tried setting the self.view.userInteractionenabled to YES but that still gives me nothing.p  pIve looked around almost every where but cant figure out why I cant click it.

Negative 1117 pI have recently enabled https on custom domain for my appengine app. Everything worked just fine for a couple of days. After a while, on some machines requests started getting aborted.p  pI observed that on the machines prone to this strange behavior, the issue was reproducible only when the following conditions were met  access the application using https from the custom domain  many requests were fired one after another like adding to the DOM 30 images, so not necessarily AJAX requestsp  pAlso I observed that on a machine that was having the problem, if the traffic would go through fiddler, the issue would disappear. p  pNow even though firing 30 requests one after another like adding to the DOM 30 images might not be the best of practices, is it normal for firefox and chrome to abort 80 of the requests only when using https on custom domain If so why the requests dont get aborted when using https and the appspot.com url of the appp  pThanks, Cristianp

Negative 1117 pIm writing a program in C that requires a call to a subroutine written in an open source C program. The C file is called shd.c. There is no header file for shd in the program. The C program by itself compiles fine with the gcc compiler, and the C program works fine when compiling it with g without the reference to the C file. p  pHowever, g very much does not like the C program, giving hundreds of errors and warnings when I compile shd by itself with g, and I get the same problems when compiling the the C program when I includes the C files. p  pAs of now, the way Im including the C file looks like thisp  precodeextern C include shd  codepre  pAnyway, I think that my only option here correct me if Im wrong is to compile the C and C files separately, with different compilers.

Negative 1117 pI have a Node application which persists data to a MongoDB database. Most of this data is in hand, such as data for the codeUsercode collection. However, the application also has the concept of codeWebsitecode collection, and for this collection, data must first be downloaded from somewhere before it is saved.p  pI am wondering how I should separate the above concerns in my application. At the service layer, I have things like codeUsercode and codeWebsitecode. They provide basic CRUD operations. At completely the opposite end of the spectrum, there is a user interface whereby uses can input a website URL. Somewhere between this UI and the application persisting the data to MongoDB the service layer, the application must make a request to this URL to gather some data. Once the data has been fetched, the codeWebsitecode service will persist it.p  pPotentially, there could be thousands of these URLs entered at once, and I do not want to bring down the Node process that handles the web server due to load issues. Therefore I think it would be a good idea to abstract the work out to a different process and use some sort of messaging bus to tie the application together.p

Negative 1117 pI need to run some business logic once and only once in a GeronimoTomcat cluster when a WAR or EAR deploys and before the applications starts serving to users.  p  pThe way Ive been doing this has been todate has been adhoc and is not fault tolerant.  I use a configuration file on node 1 and designate it the startup node.  When the application starts up in the cluster, every node writes its ip address to a database and then sleepwaits in a Servlet.init that was set to loadonstartup in web.xml.  When the startup node sees that all expected nodes have written their IP to the database, it runs the business logic.  When the startup business logic completes, it sends the allclear to the other nodes by writing a confirmation row to the database.  p  pAll of the nonstartup nodes periodically twice a second poll the database for this allclear signal, and when they see it, they finish their startup and return from Servlet.init.  At this point all of the nodes serve the application normally to users.p  pI havent had my startup logic fail yet, but I was wondering if there was some Java EE standard or robust 3rd party library approach to running my startup logic only once across my cluster.  Thanksp  pstrongEdit 20130721strong  I recalled that WebLogic Server had sophisticated startup facilities that might be useful in achieving the init only once in the cluster logic that I want to do in my GeronimoTomcat cluster.  I did some digging and yes, WebLogic can do exactly what I want  Here is a great article on the subject  a hrefhttpdevelopsimpler.blogspot.com201203weblogicclustersandsingletonservice.html relnofollowhttpdevelopsimpler.blogspot.com201203weblogicclustersandsingletonservice.htmla   p  pI cannot afford WebLogic, unfortunately.  So, is there anything similar in Geronimo or Tomcat or other open source Java EE servers  Or, are there 3rd party libraries I might use to achieve the same thingp

Negative 1117 pSo I have a tricky problem that I am not able find a better solution for.p  pI am using codedjangocompressorcode which does a great job in compressingminifying the files. The problem I am facing is during deployment.

So that way, new users dont have to feel the brunt of the compression process.p  pI know it has a management command that it can precompress the files, which then can be pushed to CDN and perhaps preload them behind the scenes on the landinglogin pages.p  pHere is the problem, in some of the javascript code, i am using context vars and django tags [both custom and native]. p  precodevar first   sometag somecontextvar  var name  somecontextvar codepre  pThis causes an error since during compression it tries to execute that tag which obviously doesnt have the values.

Negative 1117 pThere is a fairly old program I must modify to make some relatively minor changes  there are a few control variables like enum structs, magic strings and numbers from the ether that have worked fine for the last 45 years or so, but are now not good anymore. Naturally, however, in the ensuing years, the code has been lost so all we have is a decompilation option.p  pI have used both dotPeek and JustDecompile to get .csproj files out of the .dll files and the .exe file there are 4 dlls and 1 exe altogether, but both solutions ended up with a nearendless stream of syntax errors and, in dotPeeks case, notations of issues like references to compiler variables.p  pI can obviously try to painstakingly work through each file and fix every syntax error as best I can, but its looking like that could be as much as a week of effort.  I have never undertaken a decompile approach before, so when I realized the path I was looking at, I immediately wondered if I didnt know what I was doing.p  pDoes this situation sound normal for a decompile project in .net  Is there any way to more efficiently make a buildable project  Am I using my tools wrong  Is this a symptom of obfuscation which I have no experience at all withp  pThanks in advance, and please leave comments if more information is needed  since this is sort of out of my league I am not fully certain what is useful information and what is not.p

When LogicalDevice is extracted to its own class, and the references are updated, only the first attribute in the Parameter class is maintained and the rest are null. p  pThis leads me to believe that there is something special with the static inner classes. p  pFor reference here is my xml and codep  precodeltJetstream xmlnshttpJetstream.TersoSolutions.comv1.1GetPoliciesResponsegt     ltHeadergt     ltGetPoliciesResponsegt         ltPolicyListgt             ltPolicy Id53bb663f7ed041f8975790ad4e015995 NameMyPolicy                  DeviceDefinitionIdf3536a6d46104d5682d954fd6602a883 gt                 ltParameterListgt                     ltParameter Nameaggregateeventscancount Value2gt                     ltParameter Nameaggregateeventscantime Value10gt                     ltParameter Nameantenna1rxsensitivity Value50gt                     ltParameter Nameantenna1txpower Value30gt                     ltParameter Nameantenna2rxsensitivity Value50gt                     ltParameter Nameantenna2txpower Value30gt                     ltParameter Nameantenna3rxsensitivity Value50gt                     ltParameter Nameantenna3txpower Value30gt                     ltParameter Nameantenna4rxsensitivity Value50gt                     ltParameter Nameantenna4txpower Value30gt                     ltParameter Namecommandpollinterval Value60gt                     ltParameter Namedns Value0.0.0.0gt                     ltParameter Namedooropentimelimit Value300gt                     ltParameter Namegateway Value0.0.0.0gt                     ltParameter Nameip Value0.0.0.0gt                     ltParameter Namejetstreamdeviceurl Valuehttpsusdevice.tersosolutions.comv1.0devicegt                     ltParameter Namelockdownhightemp Value127gt                     ltParameter Namelockdownonacpowerfailure Value0gt                     ltParameter Namelockdownonreaderfailure Value0gt                     ltParameter Namelockdownonhightemp Value0gt                     ltParameter Namelogentryeventhightemp Value127gt                     ltParameter Namelogentryeventlowtemp Value128gt                     ltParameter Namenumberofantennas Value4gt                     ltParameter Namelogentrylevel ValueWarninggt                     ltParameter Nameobjecteventscancount Value2gt                     ltParameter Nameobjecteventscantime Value10gt                     ltParameter NameSubnet Value0.0.0.0gt                 ltParameterListgt                 ltLogicalDeviceListgt                     ltLogicalDevice LogicalDeviceIdMyDevicegt                         ltParameterListgt                             ltParameter Nameip value192.168.91.100 gt                             ltParameter Namesubnet value255.255.255.0 gt                             ltParameter Namegateway value192.168.91.1 gt                             ltParameter Namedns value192.168.91.2 gt                         ltParameterListgt                     ltLogicalDevicegt                 ltLogicalDeviceListgt             ltPolicygt         ltPolicyListgt     ltGetPoliciesResponsegt ltJetstreamgt codepre  pThe following is the modified generated code with the references updated. p  precode  This file was generated by the JavaTM Architecture for XML BindingJAXB Reference     Implementation, v2.2.7   See lta hrefhttpjava.sun.comxmljaxbgthttpjava.sun.comxmljaxbltagt   Any modifications to this file will be lost upon recompilation of the source schema.

Negative 1117 pI really like the codedivcode accordion effect, I use it a lot for site organization and navigation, but I want to try and use it for a horizontal navigation pane rather than for a vertical list.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1lay0.png altexamplep  pThe clickables pane has more than one link, and when any of the links are clicked, it expands below to show more links. So if I click link A, it will expand to show links A.A, A.B, A.C, etc if I click link B, it will do the same for links B.A, B.B, etc. I want the lower pane to be dynamic and display links relevant to the link I clicked in the clickables pane as seen in the image. I use the word link loosely in the links pane they are indeed hyperlinks, but in the clickables pane theyre just clickable words that do things onclick.p  pHow can I go about doing this I had initially tried AJAX accordion but the spacing is all wrong. Im not too well versed enough in AJAX or jQuery to make it work the way I want, so I hope hoping there was some tips on how to do it.p  pHeres some makeshift HTML illustrating what I would like to accomplish.p  precodeltdiv idnavigationgt     ltspan idAgtExpand Altspangt ampnbsp      ltspan idBgtExpand Bltspangt ltdivgt if Expand A is clicked, display the below ltdiv idexpandedAgt     lta href.link1.phpgtLink 1ltagt ampnbsp     lta href.link2.phpgtLink 2ltagt ltdivgt if Expand B is clicked, display the below ltdiv idexpandedBgt     lta href.link3.phpgtLink 3ltagt ampnbsp     lta href.link4.phpgtLink 4ltagt ltdivgt codepre  pcodeexpandedAcode and codeexpandedBcode would have the same width as codenavigationcode, and they would expand below codenavigationcode.

Negative 1117 pWe recently updated our .NET application C containing infragistics controls, Visual Studio 2010, Click Once deployment from .NET 2.0 runtime to .NET 4.0 runtime. To do so, we updated all our project properties from 2.0 to 4.0 full, so not client profile. We also changed the corresponding prerequisites from 2.0 to 4.0. Now we are facing some problems while rolling out our application to the clients.p  pWe have 2 ways to install the application 1 By using the URL of the deploy server No problem here. 2 By using the current application shortcut  which most of the users do.

Weird thing is that there are 2.0 references in the platform version info, although, the .NET 4.0 runtime is already preinstalled at the point of installation.

System.Data.SqlClient.SqlExceptionp  pIs there some way to have it not raise this exception so I can use my codeOUTPUTcode paramsp  precodetry      using DataClasses1DataContext dbContext  new DataClasses1DataContext              bool error  false         string errorText            int result  dbContext.TestSPtest, ref error, ref errorText       catch Exception ex      string err  ex.Message     throw  codepre

Negative 1117 pIm trying to implement a simple POC for a NServiceBus solution. So I implemented 3 endpoints, lets call them A,B and C. A is self hosted in a console app, B and C are NSB hosts. In A Im sending a command DoFoo, in B Im handling DoFoo and inside the handler I publish several events of type BarOccurred like sop  precodefor int i0 ilt5 i    Bus.Publishnew BarOccurred   Thread.Sleep1000  codepre  pIn C Im subscribing and handling it by writing to the console that Bar occurred.p  pI expected to see the message handled in C every time that B publishes it i.e every second. However the behavior I see is that only after the command handler exit after 5 iterations only then all 5 messages are received by C.p  pIs that the expected behavior for the default configuration Is there anything I need to declare in order to have messages sent and processed as soon as they are publishedp

Negative 1117 pI have run into a problem with the listpicker. I have a settings page with a option called Decimals where you can toggle a Toggleswitch and if you turn the toggle on, the listpicker gets enabled. Now when you click on the listpicker, you can choose from 1 to 5 as the amount of decimals. If you choose for example the number 3 in the listpicker, it will get saved to a key on isolated storage with the value 3, if you go to the MainPage it will check the isolatedstorage and if it contains the value 3, it will set a textblock to use 3 decimals. If I then go to my Settings page again, the app crashed with the message SelectedIndex must always be set to a valid value.

Negative 1117 pMy understanding of system calls is that in Linux the system call mechanism codeint 0x80code or whatever is documented and guaranteed to be stable across different kernel versions. Using this information, the system calls are implemented directly in the CRT library, so that when I call e.g. codeprintfacode this involves a single function call to the CRT, where the system call is set up and activated. In theory this can be improved further by statically compiling the CRT not common on Linux, but a possibility so that even the single function call may be inlined.p  pOn the other hand, Windows does not document or even guarantee consistency of the system call mechanism. The emonlyem way to make a system call on Windows is to call into codentdll.dllcode or maybe some other code.dllcode which is done from the CRT, so there are strongtwostrong function calls involved. If the CRT is used statically and the function gets inlined slightly more common on Windows than Linux we still have the single function call into codentdll.dllcode that we cant get rid of.p  pSo it seems to me that theoretically system calls on Windows will be inherently slower since they always have to do one function call more than their Linux equivalents. Is this understanding and my explanation above truep  pstrongNotestrong I am asking this purely theoretically. I understand that when doing a system call which I think always involves 2 context switches  one in each direction the cost of an extra function call is probably completely negligible.p

Negative 1117 pIm very puzzled by this. Here is what I encountered.p  pI wrote a perl code to calculate the difference of two numbers and based on whether the difference is above 0.5, it decides whether to print that line or not. p  pTo give a toy examplep  precodea   0.9 0.4 b   0.8 0.2 c   0.7 0.3 d   0.81 0.3 e   0.79 0.3 codepre  pSo the code is supposed to print out line a,b,d but not c,e. I have tried two ways of doing thisp  p1.Directly test if the difference is greater than or equal to 0.5 and if so, printp  precodechomp my array  splitt my diff  array[1]  array[2] if diff gt0.5      print    codepre  p2.Output the difference first into a file and then use awk to selectp  precode print ,t,diff,n  Then with awk awk  if NF gt 0.5 print file  codepre  pI was surprised to find that the two ways generated two different results for my actual filemillion of lines. The awk way gave slightly more results. I looked at where the two outputs differ and it seems using all perl way 1 have missed some lines. p  pDoes anyone know why this is the case Is there something wrong with doing this calculation and conditional testing in perlp
Negative 1117 pI use a codeDefaultListCellRenderercode to render an array of Strings its not really an array of Strings, its just to explain my question.

If a user enters anything from HZ, that isnt a valid musical note, and thus should not generate a frequency  In fact, a red error message should appear next to the note name field.p  pMy codeFrequencyLineViewModelcode looks like this...p  precodepublic enum NoteSign       Natural,     Sharp,     Flat   public class FrequencyLineViewModel  IValidatableObject      [Required]     public string NoteName  get set       [Required]     public NoteSign NoteSign  get set       [Required]     public int Octave  get set       public Dictionaryltstring, floatgt FrequencyLookup  new Dictionaryltstring, floatgt          Each note from A0 to G0 has an associated frequency.  This lists em.          A full listing of the frequency table is not salient to this question.           public IEnumerableltValidationResultgt ValidateValidationContext context              ListltValidationResultgt results  new ListltValidationResultgt          byte asciiCode  byte NoteName.ToUpper[0]         ifasciiCode gt 72     Between H and Z            ampamp asciiCode lt 90                      results.Addnew ValidationResultInvalid, new []NoteName                    Could add other validations here          return results       codepre  pSo far in my tests, I have modified my strongactionstrongp  precodepublic void AddFrequencyLineFrequencyLineViewModel model      model.IsValid  ModelState.IsValid     if ModelState.IsValid              model.CalculateFrequency         return PartialViewNoteRecord, model            Need to change this...but to what     model.ErrorMessage  Something is wrong     return model  codepre  p...But Im lost on how best to implement the fruits of a validation.  I set a breakpoint in my modified action on the codemodel.IsValidcode check, and found that, in invalid cases such as an empty form, or a note from HZ, that it is properly flagging as invalid conversely, when entering a valid form, it works as intended.  But, Im not interested in the works right part the invalid state has me stymied.p  pI could simply return the error message as Im doing and use JavaScript in the success handler to figure out where to put it, if the IsValid property of the result is false only happens on the invalid code path.  The problem is, this defeats the purpose of the strongsuccessstrong handler whats really happening is an error state.p  pSo, at long last, to my strongQuestionstrong Im trying to show some Validation Messages, but this setup dosent lend itself to doing that.  What can I do to make this AJAXbased model validation present validation messages, without using my JavaScript success handlerp  pEDIT The reason this is a question, is because our team wants to keep as much of our business logic on the server as possible were striving for a thinclient setup. This means that the JavaScript will be only responsible 1 for GUI state, 2 for funneling data back to the server for processing, and 3 for receiving data from the server for presentation. p

Negative 1117 pI have successfully integrated a facebook Login.  The problem is, when a user logs in through facebook, if they are not registered, it will create a user in the db for me.  This would be good but if they try to login later through regular methods ie, my pages sign in they wouldnt be able to  because they never actually created a password.  p  pThey also wont be able to create an account with their facebook email because Ive saved that too.p  pAfter a couple days, and thanks to magnum2002 s help, I would like to use a beforefilter to check to see if they have a password.  The problem is, they have one EVEN if they logged in through facebook.  So an idea I had was to create a different column in my user db called createdpw.  I use a hidden field on the form where the user actually created a password, and set it to true.  This way, if the user signed up through conventional methods, my DB will know that they created a password.  Then set the beforefilter to see if THIS column is filled out. Testing this though, I saw that you can edit hidden fields in chromes developer tools.  Is there anyway to pass this information to my server without it actually being editablep  pThen I will continue with Magnums suggestionp  precodeuser.rb     def self.findforfacebookoauthauth, signedinresourcenil     user  User.whereprovider gt auth.provider, uid gt auth.uid.first     if user       return user     else       registereduser  User.whereemail gt auth.info.email.first       if registereduser         return registereduser       else         user  User.create                              nameauth.extra.rawinfo.name,                             providerauth.provider,                             uidauth.uid,                             emailauth.info.email,                             passwordDevise.friendlytoken[0,20],                                  end         end end  end codepre  pMaybe I could do that in the callback...p  precodeclass OmniauthCallbacksController lt DeviseOmniauthCallbacksController      def facebook          user  User.findforfacebookoauthrequest.env[omniauth.auth], currentuser           if user.persisted             signinandredirect user, event gt authentication this will throw if user is not activated       setflashmessagenotice, success, kind gt Facebook if isnavigationalformat     else       session[devise.facebookdata]  request.env[omniauth.auth]       redirectto newuserregistrationurl     end    end  end codepre  pHeres my application controllerp  precodeclass ApplicationController lt ActionControllerBase  protectfromforgery with exception  def aftersigninpathforresource     if currentuser haspasswordfrompreviousregistration    request.env[omniauth.origin]  storedlocationforresource  rootpath     else        request.env[omniauth.origin]  storedlocationforresource   currentusereditpath   end  end end codepre  pWould the commented code above in the application controller be the right ideap

Negative 1117 pI was hoping someone could help me answer a couple of questions regarding Tableau. I am not as familiar with the platform, but I have a client who is looking for a reportinganalyticsdata visualization platform that they could use for many of the internal apps for their employees and external customer facing internet with login applications. p  pThe driver is that each of their internal teams has used many disparate technologies such as SSRS, Crystal, custom ASP.NET controls KendoTelerik, etc, but now they have the opportunity to choose a common platform that could serve mostall of the future reporting and data visualization needs for enterprise and customer facing solutions.p  pThey are looking for a platform that provides everything from simple grids with basic filtersortgroup, all the way to rich charting and adhoc reporting with slicing and dicing of data.p  pThey will not always be creating dashboards in these apps since they are customerfacing, but they may want to have dashboards for internal intranet apps. They will definitely want the ability to build true internal BI dashboards to report on data from all these online apps across all customers, to whom they provide their SaaScustomerfacing web apps.p  pOne of our main concerns revolves around security of data, as some of these customerfacing web apps are multitenant, so wed need to ensure that data is always filtered by the client tenant id.  Also we have a very customized security model, with data driven roles, permissions that may prevent showing certain types of data e.g. SSN, Salary, etc etc.p  pstrongDoes Tableau fits this model, can it meet mostall of these requirements, or is it meant more for internal datastrong p
Negative 1117 pStack,p  pIm developing an application to work with Revit 2014.  Whether it will run inside of Revit or outside as an external application is yet to be determined.  At this point, Im attempting to prove the concept using commands through the add in tab.  The goal is to allow the user to create conduit in Revit through an external interface, but I cant seem to find a method similar to AutoCADs Pick Point.  Id like for the user to select a point, or series of, and have the XYZs communicated back to me via the API.  Ill use those points to perform some calculations, addingfilling shared parameters based on the work being done, then draw the conduit for them, just as Revit would.  I know that Revit is lacking in their Electrical API, so if it has to be done with a pipe or placeholder and then converted to a conduit, thats fine too.  p  pIve successfully created conduithpipepipe placeholders with known XYZs Hardcoded but the idea is have the user choose the XYZ.  Am I way off base with this  Any help is greatly appreciated.   p  pThe development is being done with the Revit 2014 API, Visual Studio 2010 Express for now, with intentions to jump to Ultimate when funding comes through and believe it or not VB6.p  pThanks in advance, Runninp

Negative 1117 pI am trying to build a simple API to allow a client to send me data over HTTPS.  I created a class that will take a usernamepassword then it does a database look up. If the user is found then it issues a token. Then the token will be send back to the requester via HTTP header.p  pOnce a username, password and a token sent back then the script reads the data sent from the client via codePOSTcode request and processes it.p  pThe challenge that I am having is sending the token to the requester via cURL and receiving the codeUSERNAMEcode, codePASSWORDcode amp codeTOKENcode from the HTTP header correctly.p  pMy question is how can I correctly send the token via HTTP header in the codegenerateTokencode method Also how can I read the HTTP headers once the request is madep  pBelow is my class api.php filep

Negative 1117 pA have a set of lights  l1, l2, l3, l4,.....lx etc.p  pAt any given point in time, only a contiguous sequence of lights is on. For examplep  pl2,l3,l4 can be on. Or l9,l10,l11 can be on. But it is not possible to have a gap in between. For example, you cant have l3,l7,l8.p  pAt every tick of the clock, Im told which are the starting and finishing lights in the sequence, and I need to make sure only the lights within the range are on. This means I may have to switch on or off lights, depending on which lights were on and off in the previous tick. If lights are already on or off, then I dont need to update those lights..p  pWhat is the quickest way to compute which lights to turn on and off  Ive come up with a number of solutions, but cannot decide which is bestp  ol lipLinear approach In this solution, I iterate through all the lights from l0...lx. I check if each light is in the range. If it is, I make sure its on, if not, I make sure its off. This is simple to implement, but is wasteful if there are no changes, and worse, if the range is towards the end e.g. l9,l10,l11 etcpli lipSeries of ifs In this approach, I keep track of the start  end of the range in the previous tick of the clock, and compare it with the range from the current tick.p  ul liIf the ranges are same, do nothing. ls,usli liIf lower limit increases, turn of lights till new lower limit. lili liif upper limit increases, turn on lights till new upper limit. uili liIf lower limit decreases, turn on lights from new lower limit to old ldli liif upper limit decreases, turn off lights from old upper limit to new upper limit. ud. As you can see, in approach 2, there are nine possible combinations of changes. So the second approach has a lot of ifs, and so it is unclear to me what the best way to code this have 9 if else blocks  seems messyli ul  pli,ui li,us li,ud ls,ui ls,us ls,ud ld,ui ld,us ld,udpli lipPointer approach  In this approach, I create arrays of both the ranges..pli ol  pEg array 1 3,4,5     array 2 4,5,6,7p  pI use p,q to point to the current cell in each array that I am observing.p  pI start reading from the lowest index of both arrays If array1[p] lt array2[q] , then I turn of the light at index array1[p], and increment p If array1[p]  array2[q] , then I increment p and q, since the light is already on. if array1[p]  array2[q] , then I turn on the light at array2[q], and increment q. I can optimise this approach, by checking if the start  finish index is the same.p  pI think approach 3 is the best  since the code is easiest to read and seems quick. I can implement all 3, but cant decide which approach is best. Would appreciate suggestions on better methods, or how to choose from these three and optimise them. Either C or C can be used in my app.p  pEDIT The ranges in two consecutive ticks could be far apart and differ in size.. Eg Tick 1 could be 3,4,5 and tick 2 could be 7,8,9,10. So in this example, I would have to switch off lights at 3,4,5 and then turn on at 7,8,9,10.p  pEDIT Lights are an analogy Im using to explain the problem. Lights just refer to an object in software.p  pEDIT I have access to only one thread, so cannot parallelise any part of this.p

Negative 1117 pIm trying to track down an error that appears to be definitely a timing issue.  I have an application that uses a Universal Framework.  When the process is complete in the framework an NSNotification is sent back to the application.  We have recently added a third party framework to our framework.  Now, while the methods for the third party framework are being executed, as execution returns to our framework I receive the following error in the Console Outputp  precodeAssertion failed exclusive, function assertlocked, file ..depincludeboostboost1550boostthreadpthreadsharedmutex.hpp, line 51. codepre  pBut Im not sure that is the ultimate issue, because our framework continues to execute and the NSNotification is sent back to the application.  Right after the Notification is sent and execution returns to the calling method or the method call in our framework I see a warning on the executing thread.  Then, execution continues back to the original calling method and the warning goes away.  p  pHeres the weird part.  If I step through the code very slowly, it might just work.  If Im not slow enough I get the SIGSTOP and the code never returns to the UI.  If Im too fast, I get a SIGABRT.p  pIve been trying to find the exact issue using Instuments.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma135294201735836This answer to a similar questiona backed up my suspicion that this is a timing issue.

Negative 1117 pIs there any way to set the point of view in a CSS 3D transform So far, I can create a virtual 3D space in html and in that space I have labels, each with an x,y,z coordinate. However, I can only seem to view this space from an outside perspective  i.e. if I create a hollow cube, I can only see the outside . Is there a way to set the location of the viewer in this space  i.e. be inside the hollow cube  I only have a bit of experience with these technologies, but I am not afraid of any math that may be involved. Additionally, I would like to avoid nonvanilla code such as Three.js. Thank you all for your considerations, and I would be more than happy to answer any clarifying questions.p

Negative 1117 pI am searching for a Python implementation of computing dissimilarity measures of a sparse matrix. I used using scipy.spatial.distance.pdist. But I get an error p  precode ValueError setting an array element with a sequence.  codepre  pI think this is because pdist does not work on scipy.sparse.csc.cscmatrix. It works fine on dense matrix. So far I have been using p  precodeDismat  A.TT codepre  pto compute the euclidean distance, where A is the sparse matrix and Dismat is the dissimilarity matrix. But I would like to compute other distance such as Manhattan, jaccard, shortest path and so on.p  pI am wondering if anyone know whether there is a python package that calculates dissimilarity measures of a scipy.sparse.csc.cscmatrix.

Negative 1117 pstrongIs it possible to validate a signature only having an ancestor or root certificate in the hierarchystrongp  pemDisclaimer Im a newbie to the certificates handling so please forgive the naive terminology.emp  pConsider the following situation.p  ul liWe have two parties lets call them strongIdPstrong for Identity Provider and strongSPstrong for service provider and some central certificate authority strongCAstrong which is definitely trusted by both IdP and SP.li liCA has its own certificate strongCertCAstrong known to both IdP and SP imported into IdPs and SPs keystore under some aliasli liOut CA issues one certificate for IdP strongCertIdPstrong and one for SP strongCertSPstrong.li liIdP has CertIdP in its keystore and knows password for it so IdP can sign messages with CertIdPli liSame for SPCertSPli liNow lets assume that SP does not know CertIdP and IdP does not know CertSP. They only know CertCA which was used to sign CertIdP and CertSP. As I understand, we have a certificate hierarchy CertIdP  CertCA lt CertSP hereli liIdP wants to send a signed message to SP. It creates a message and then uses CertIdP to sign it.li liSP receives the message signed by the IdP using CertIdP. As noted above, SP does not have the CertIdP, only the parent certificat CertCA.li ul  pMy question is strongCan SP validate the signature of the message signed by CertIdP only having its parent certificate CertCAstrongp  pstrongBackstory, why want it.strongp  pWere implementing SAMLBased SSO with PicketLink. Were using PicketLinks a hrefhttpsdocs.jboss.orgauthordisplayPLINKSAML2SignatureValidationHandlerSAML2SignatureValidationHandlera to validate signatures. To achieve this, Service Provider SP needs to have IdPs certificate in its keystore. When a signed SAML assertion is passed to SP, this handler uses the IdPs certificate to validate the signature.p  pThe process above works well, but we have some organisational concerns. This process assumes that SP has the IdPs certificate for validation. In case something changes, IdPs certificate must be replaced on the SP side. We may have a large number of SPs hunreds when not thousands so this is quite an effort.p  pSince both CertIdP and CertSP are issued by the same authority CA which is definitely trusted by both IdP and SP, we had the idea that we may use the CAs certificate for signature validation. If this works, this might eliminate the need to exchange certificates between IdP and SP. The CAs certificate is also very longliving so if only have to be exchanged once in eternity eternity, in our case is around 1020 years.p  pHowever I am not sure if it is technically possible to validate the signature signed with CertIdP only having the parent CertCA. Is it possible Or are we on completely wrong track herep  pIf its relevant, were on JavaJBoss platform on SP side, IdP is a thirdparty software.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThis is the signature I get at the moment from IdPp  precode    ltdsSignature xmlnsdshttpwww.w3.org200009xmldsiggt         ltdsSignedInfogt             ltdsCanonicalizationMethod Algorithmhttpwww.w3.org200110xmlexcc14n gt             ltdsSignatureMethod Algorithmhttpwww.w3.org200009xmldsigrsasha1 gt             ltdsReference URI...gt                 ltdsTransformsgt                     ltdsTransform                         Algorithmhttpwww.w3.org200009xmldsigenvelopedsignature gt                     ltdsTransform Algorithmhttpwww.w3.org200110xmlexcc14ngt                         ltecInclusiveNamespaces xmlnsechttpwww.w3.org200110xmlexcc14n                             PrefixListds saml samlp gt                     ltdsTransformgt                 ltdsTransformsgt                 ltdsDigestMethod Algorithmhttpwww.w3.org200009xmldsigsha1 gt                 ltdsDigestValuegtr...ltdsDigestValuegt             ltdsReferencegt         ltdsSignedInfogt         ltdsSignatureValuegtX...ltdsSignatureValuegt     ltdsSignaturegt codepre

Negative 1117 pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.comyoutubeyoutubeiosplayerhelper relnofollowYouTube iOS Player Helper Viewa and the player itself works wonderfully. However, I want the user to be able to tap on the video and have it start playing. I tried adding a UITagGestureRecognizer to the YTPlayerView, but it didnt register any of my taps. p  pI added a UIButton to my view and connected it to my IBAction that tells the YTPlayerView to play and that worked fine. However, I want it to appear to the user as if theyve tapped the video itself. So, I resized my UIButton to be the same size as the YTPlayerView and put the UIButton on top of the YTPlayerView. p  pTaps on the UIButton no longer work.... almost. Any taps to the left, right, or bottom of the YTPlayerView dont work. Taps above the YTPlayerView still go through. So, if I shift my UIButton 10 pixels up, I can tap just on the 10 pixel strip and my IBAction will get called. If I move the UIButton 10 or 30 pixels to the left, right, or bottom, none of the taps make it through to my IBAction. p  pWhat the hell This is WEIRD.  p  pIn the image below, my UIButton has a green background with transparency so that you can see whats behind it. I have tested this with it fully opaque and it behaves the same way, the transparency is not the issue. If I tap in the green area inside the red box i.e. above the YTPlayerView, then my IBAction is called as expected. If I tap inside the green area outside of the red box i.e. left, right, or below the YTPlayerView, then I never received my IBAction.p  pThis whole view is enclosed in a UIScrollView. I tried adding a UITapGestureRecognizer to self.view and when I try tapping the YTPlayerView, that tap is delivered to me as if it hits the UIScrollView instead of the YTPlayerView.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6WwD3.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1117 pSo my question revolves around the use of Spring AOP with XML based schema versus using it with AspectJ. From looking around online Ive been trying to figure out which approach to take for AOP. One particular scenario has me slightly confusedp  pSuppose I have a number of classes with n number of methods, and I want to apply advice from my aspect class to certain methodsjoin points but not all, I can see when using AspectJ that this would be fairly straightforward  I just apply my aspect annotation to the methods that should use the advice. However, from what Ive seen of the xml based approach, I would have to create a pointcut for each of these methods assuming they cant be covered by one expression i.e. each method has a distinct name and if I was using the proxy based approach a proxy class for each targetclass. The AspectJ approach seems much tidier in this sense.p  pSo is my understanding of the two methods correct or have I missed out on some part of Spring AOP that can achieve a neater solution for the xml approach p  pSorry for the longwinded explanation, but I wanted to make the scenario as clear as possible...p

Negative 1117 pI have a legacy system and a new system that I have to support were currently in the process of migrating out of the legacy system, but it will be some time before that is finished.  Thus, in the meantime, users need access to both systems.p  pDuring our migration process so far, I have users in both systems that are linked via matching codeuuidcode attributes.  Given a users codeuuidcode, I can find their activity in both systems and it works well.p  pHowever, when we create a new user, we need that user to also be replicated in the legacy system so they have access until the legacy system is completely migrated.p  pA simple solution is creating a cron job with a rake task that runs periodically and grabs all users from the new system and ensures they are replicated in the legacy system.p  pA more complex solution would be creating a syncing application that talks to both DBs and periodically runs the sync task.  That isolates the app with a single purpose and also keeps the newer codebase cleaner.  When the legacy system is migrated, we will eventually kill it, and I dont really want a lot of legacy code in the new system.p  pHas anyone else run into a similar situation where they have to keep 2 systems in sync for an extended period of time  Is this a situation where employ a serviceorientated architecture would be beneficialp  pIs there a cleaner solution to keeping systems in sync besides periodically syncing themp

Negative 1117 pThe app I am working on uses Onionkit to do TSLSSL certificate verification. I added Volley support in the app, but realized that Volley only supports the Apache HttpClient, while Onionkit uses the boye.androidlib HttpClient. So these 2 do not work together. Right now I am using the fork of Volley at here a hrefhttpsgithub.comkulikvolley.git relnofollowhttpsgithub.comkulikvolley.gita, it works with the boye library so my app is working. p  pHowever I would rather just use Volley. Is there a way to make it work I looked at HurlStack class, it has the SSLSocketFactory field. I suppose this one will work for the Cert verification. But I have not figured out a way to get it work. Sorry for the kind of vague question but I am not a security expert. When using the Onikit, I passed in the cert pins to the TrustManager. However I have not found a way to link the SSLFactory with the TrustManager. Any help will be appreciated.p  pThanks Rayp

Negative 1117 pIn modern OpenGL 3.x, you create buffer objects which contain vertex attributes, such as positions, colors, normals, texture coordinatess, amp indices.p  pThese buffers are then assigned to a corresponding strongvertex array object VAOstrong which essentially contains pointers to all of the data as well as the datas format.p  pThere are many tutorials out there for how to create a VAO and how to use it unfortunately, it isnt clear how VAOs should be used for larger applications or games.p  pFor example, a game might contain many 3D models, and it seems appropriate to separate each model by a different VAO.p  pOn the other hand, a particle system contains many disconnected primitives traveling independent of one another.  In this scenario, using a single VAO per system might improve performance in CPUGPU transfers.  However, in this case, the primitives need to be translated differently than one another, so it might seem viable to separate each particle into a very tiny VAO.p  h2Questionh2  ul liFor a large quantity of small data sets such as a particle system of quads, should all of the data be packed into 1 VAO or divided into many VAOs  What are the performance benefitsdrawbacks in each methodli ul  pAssumming 1 VAO is used, the only apparent way to translate each independent subunit of data is to modify the actual position information and reload it into the GPU.  Doing this many times is costly in terms of time performance.p  pAssuming many VAOs are used, then the GPU must store duplicate formatting information for each VAO.  This seems to be costly in terms of space but Im not sure if this is necessarily slow.p  pstrongSideNotestrongbr Yes, Im personally interested in managing a particle system.  To keep this question more generic, and more useful for others, I am asking about VAO management as a whole.   I am curious what management methods are more suitable vs others when considering the type of data being stored and when considering what type of performance is desired timespace.p  phr VAO creation is described well herep  ul lia hrefhttpswww.opengl.orgwikiVertexSpecification relnofollowhttpswww.opengl.orgwikiVertexSpecificationali ul

Negative 1117 pIm currently reading some old mapping code from one domain model to another, and ive stumbled accross something.  EDIT  The difference between these domain models are their vesions. So alot of fields are named with the suffi V2 or V3 for instance. the MigrateToLatest methods, are simply mapping functions that maps between the types. So for instance if MigrateToLatest is called on a list of element, each element calls its MigrateToLatest method. If these elements again contains complex elements, these again calls MigrateToLatest.p  pOkay so theres strongalotstrong of code that looks like this going on.  p  precode return this.SomeFieldV3 null  this.SomeFieldV2.MigrateToLatest  null codepre  pBut theres also some coe that looks like thisp  precodereturn this.SomeField  this.SomeField  null, codepre  pSo I understand that in the first line, in order to avoid a null pointer exception, its first checked that the field is not null, and else null is returned. But i dont really understand the second line  or at least I dont think i do...p  pI looked the codecode operator up, at MSDN, but it seems superfluous in this context. If the value is not null, then the field is returned, and if the field is not, null is returned anyway Sp  pTo me it looks like these two lines are doing the same thing, but since I know for a fact that the same programmer wrote the entire mapping class, I cant shake the feeling that they are different  why else would someone choose to do the same thing in two different waysp  pSo are these two lines of code doing the same thing or not And if they are which are the preferred use, and if they are not can someone please elaborate on the differencep

Negative 1117 pIm struggling with this question p  blockquote   pPrompt the user to enter a number, print the number in 16bit twos complementp      pTo print the number you will print each bit as either the string 1   or the string 0, using a loop that will print one bit in each   iteration. Start printing with bit 15. Recall that we number the bits   starting from 0 at the low order bit. In your loop test bit 15, and   then print either 1 or 0. Use a shift instruction to get the next   bit into position 15 before repeating.p blockquote  pI unfortunately missed a lecture that was about shifts and using masks, so I dont really have much understanding of how I would go about doing this lab. How can I print a specific bit of a number I understand that I just keep printing bit 15, and then doing a shift left, but I have no idea this would be done in MIPS. Any help would be very much appreciated.p  pEDIT p  pI understand the shifting perfectly, its just printing the bit thats confusing me. p  pFor example, if the number I wanted to convert to twos complement was 25 and is in register t0.p  pFirst I print the 15th bit. Then I do a shift left. And then I repeat 15 times.p  pIt should look something like this p  precode Print bit sll     t0, t0, 1 codepre  pI just dont get how to print the first bit at spot 15. p

Negative 1117 pI have a block with codengrepeatcode that is defined like this p  precodeltdiv ngshowisPageSelecteditem.page classblock ngrepeatitem in datagt   ... ltdivgt codepre  pCurrently I can switch between those blocks, by clicking certain elements. It works via codengshowisPageSelecteditem.pagecode as you might have guessed. It all works fine, but they are switching instantly and I want to add an animation, a simple fade infade out will do. p  pSo, the block that is no longer selected should fade out and when its gone a new block should fade in. When Im using codengAnimatecode they fade in and fade out simultaneously. I need the first block to disappear completely and be hidden with codedisplay nonecode and when its done the next block should appear and fade in. Its a rather straightforward task when using jQuery, but how do I do that elegantly with Angular.jsp  pI have a strong suspicion that Angular.js isnt exactly a good choice for a site with complex animations.p  pEDIT To simplify my question, all I need to do is p  ol liOn a button click start an animationli liWhen an animation has been finished, change modelli liRun another animation.li ol  pSince I need to change the model after an animation, its probably not possible to do it via pure CSS. The only way I know of triggering animations on specific elements in angular is to create a directive, pass a scope variable into the directive, create watcher for that variable in the directive and then change the variable from the controllerp  precodeltdiv animationpagegtltdivgt codepre  hr  precodeapp.directiveanimation, function     return          scope  page animation ,         link functionscope, element             scope.watchpage, functionnewVal                 ...                             codepre  pI guess it would work, but it seems really bloated to create a directive just for that. Also, how would I change codescope.pagecode with this approach only when the animation has been finished Add another scope variable just to trigger an animation and somehow change codescope.pagecode when an animation has been finished Its possible to do it with codengFxcode module, but the amount of code it takes is just ridiculous. At this point I think adding jQuery animations to the controller would be a prettier way to solve it.p  pEDIT Thats how it looks like with jQuery animationsp  precodescope.changePage  functionpage    .block.animateopacity 0, 500, function     scope.page.id  page     scope.apply     this.animateopacity 1, 500     codepre  pIt works fine and its not quite as verbose as the way with directives, but I have to use CSS selectors and thats just feels very unangular. Do you guys use something similar when dealing with animationsp  pEDIT Somewhat similar approach using codengFxcodep  precode    ltdiv nghideswitchPageAnimation               classblock fxfadenormal fxspeed300 fxtriggergt codepre  hr  pIn the controllerp  precode  scope.switchPageAnimation  false    scope.changePage  functionpage      ifscope.page.id  page  scope.switchPageAnimation return     scope.switchPageAnimation  true     scope.onfadenormalenter, function       scope.page.id  page       scope.switchPageAnimation  false         codepre  pIm not using CSS selectors, but still it looks awful. I have to define a scope variable for the animation and then check if the animation is already running. I feel like I am missing something really obvious.p

Negative 1117 pIve got a UITableView, each cell has an image and two labels, as you can see on the first picturep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAOeRt.png altenter image description herep  pSo I am trying ti use selfsizing cells and everything is great, except 2 thingsp  p1 First and Second cell dont show content properly, but after I scroll down and then return to them everything is ok. I tried to use [tableview reloadData] in viewDidApper, but it doesnt help. Watch the labels at first they dont fit.

Im scrolling the table and everything is great, but the problem happens, when I select the row. Its pushing me to detail view, but when I press back and return to master view, the tableview jumps,so Im coming back not to the selected row, also if I scroll the table it doesnt scroll smooth, but jumps. Here are the links for two videos, first one shows that scroll is smooth a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchv9wAICcZwfO4 relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchv9wAICcZwfO4a if i dont go to detail view, and the second shows the jumping problem a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvfRcQ3Za1wDM relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvfRcQ3Za1wDMa .p  pIts absolutely sure connected with self sizing cells,because if I dont use it,none of this problem happens.

Negative 1117 pIve got a WebGL scene, and a set of parameters I can use to balance render quality versus speed. Id like to display the scene to the user in as high as I can make the quality, as long as the frame rate doesnt drop below some threshold due to this. To achieve this, I have to somehow measure current frame rate in response to changes in quality.p  pBut the scene is static as long as the user doesnt interact with it like rotating camera using the mouse. I dont want to have a loop rerendering the same scene all the time even if nothing changes. I want to stop rendering if the scene stops moving. Which means I cant simply average the time between successive frames, since I cant distinguish between the renderer being slow and the user just moving his mouse more slowly.p  pI thought about rendering the scene a number of times at start up, and judge the frame rate from this. But the complexity of the scene might change over time, due to the portion of the scene visible from the current camera position, or due to user interaction outside the canvas. So I have to adapt the quality as the scene changes complexity. Running a calibration loop after every mouse release would perhaps be an option.p  pI also thought about using the codefinishcode call instead of the codeflushcode call to accurately measure render time. But while I wait for GL to finish rendering, my application will essentially be unresponsive, in particular wont be able to queue mouse events. Since I envision the rendering to ideally take up all the time between two frames at the target threshold frame rate, that would probably be rather bad. I might get away with using codefinishcode instead of codeflushcode only on some occasions, like after a mouse release.p  pWhats the best way to achieve a desired frame rate in a WebGL application, or to measure render time on a regular basisp

Negative 1117 pI dont have a lot of experience with Java or Certificates and I am finding myself in a very bad situation concerning the signing of a java jar file its an applet. I was given the task because no one else here is any better at it than me. I apologize if this is a duplicate question but none of the fixes I found seem to work for me. Ditto with my Google searches, which all seem to require an in depth knowledge of certificates and the tools for handling them.p  pI was hoping someone could walk me through the steps of 1. Creating a keystore that could later import a PKCS 712 certificate. 2. Having it generate a public key to send to the certificate website GoDaddy. 3. Import the PKCS certificate into the keystore. 4. Sign the jar file.p  pThe site my CA gave me is either out of date or just wrong.p  pa hrefhttpssupport.godaddy.comhelparticle4780javacodesigninggeneratingacsr relnofollowhttpssupport.godaddy.comhelparticle4780javacodesigninggeneratingacsrap  pI am hoping its all possible using the java keytool utility.

Negative 1117 pIm working inside a templated system where i can implement code, but i cant modified the core of the file. My layer are stacked like thisp  precodeltdiv classlayer1gt     ltdiv classlayer2gt         ltdiv class layer3gt             ltdiv classlayer4gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classlayer1gt     ltdiv classlayer2gt         ltdiv class layer3gt             ltdiv classlayer4gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classlayer1gt     ltdiv classlayer2gt         ltdiv class layer3gt             ltdiv classlayer4gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAs you can see, my class all have the same name layer1, layer2, etc.... I want to know if theres a way by using Javascript, Jquery or any other online client side library to modify the CSS class name so, for example, the first layer1 become level1 and the following layer1 become level 2p  pThank for your answerp
Negative 1117 pLet me be clear, the method I describe below is operational. Im hoping to improve the throughput of the method. It works, and it works quite well. Were looking to scale throughput even more which is why Im looking into this.p  pThe task at hand is to improve the performance of a scoring algorithm which returns the best score for a collection of tasks. I have collection of tasks that I perform the scoring on using an codeExecutorServicecode. Each task checks to see if it now has the best score, and updates the best score in a synchronized fashion if it is the new best. To give some insight into the scale Im working at, Each task takes a fraction of a millisecond to complete, but there are thousands of them, resulting in several hundred milliseconds to find the best one. I execute this scoring algorithm several hundred times a minute. The result is that 30 second out of 60 is spent running this scoring algorithm.p  pWhen my thread pool is 8 threads with 24 virtual cores, the tasks take 0.3 ms each. When I have 20 threads same machine, 24 virtual cores the tasks take 0.6 ms each. I suspect that as I add more threads to my codeExecutorServicecode thread pool that my performance is getting worse because of this synchronization on the best score more threads contending for the lock.p  pI have done quite a bit of searching, but cant seem to find satisfactory actually, I cant seem to find any alternatives. Im thinking about collecting all scores and either storing in sorted order, or sorting after all tasks are completedbut Im unsure if this will be any improvement.p  pDoes anyone have any thoughts of another, more efficient way of collecting the best scorep  pHeres the current methodologyp  precodefinal double[] bestScore   Double.MAXVALUE   for each item in the collection      tasks.addExecutors.callablenew Runnable          public void run              double score  ... do the scoring for the task             if score lt bestScore[0]                  synchronizedbestScore                      if score lt bestScore[0]   check again after we have the lock                         bestScore[0]  score                         ...                          also save off other task identifiers in a similar fashion                                                                    end of loop creating scoring tasks  ListltFutureltObjectgtgt futures  executorService.invokeAlltasks ...timeout params here ...  handle cancelled tasks    now use the best scoring task that was saved off when it was found. codepre

Note that this is an iOS project, but the feed method apparently consumes memory in the range of 10 GBrunning on the simulator. p  pWhat could possibly be going wrong here I have debugged with breakpoints, and with profilers, and it is definitely a problem with the feed method. p  pUpdate I was using the GAINBLOCKS compensator when I encountered the above issue. Using just the GAIN compensator seems to produce much faster results with negligible memory consumption. So I assume that there is an issue with GAINBLOCKS compensation.p

Negative 1117 pIm working in a piece of code, and I think my brain is in an infinite loop.p  pIm working with adwords scripts pure JS.p  pI receive an XML Feed of products more or less, there are 50000 products in the feed. Those products come with a lot of attributes product type, brand, name, id, etc. p  pIn Adwords, every account group its products in different levels one account group them by Product Type  brand, other by brand  name, other by productType1  brand  productType2  Id, etc. p  pThe logic is simple. When a group of products fulfill a condition for example, it have more than 1000 clicks, I need to create one more level. For example, ProductType Glasses has a lot of products. When Glasses has more than 1000 clicks, I have to subdivide Glasses with its brands Glasses  RayBan, Glasses  Gucci, etc. If any of those brands, have more than 1000 clicks, I subdivide again with its name.p  pAs every account as its levels, Ive created a levels array. For examplep  precodevar order  [ProductTypeL1, Brand, OfferId] codepre  pThis order array will be different for every account.p  pAt first, I saved all the products in a simple arrayp  precodefor var i  0 i lt products.resources.length i    allProducts.pushproducts.resources[i]  codepre  pBut later, when I get a report with product types, brands, names, etc, with more than 1000 clicks, I have to make a loop to check what products have the same, for example, productType than my new report.p  pI walk through the order array, asking if any group of this level fulfill the conditionp  precodefori0 iltorder.length1i        logic      codepre  pIn conclusion, I have multiple loops, that are not efficients.p  pTo solve it, I thought that there must be another method to save allProducts in an associative array, where de indexName could be the productType Name, or the brandName, or whatelse, and later I only would have to ask if exists p  precodeallproducts[valueForThisReportProductType] codepre  porp  precodeallproducts[valueForThisReportProductType][valueForThisReportBrand] codepre  pAnd here is where I am. I dont know how to create that type of array, or object, JSON, or mix.p  pThe idea is that I need to be able to access the first level, and ask for the name of all its childs, and every child have its own childs.p  pAny ideasp  pSorry for my very bad english, I need to practice it much more.p

Negative 1117 pIm working with file upload and crop in php and jquery. Now I got a problem that if file type is changed from any other to image file type then my code throws valid file type and in php while cropping it cant get that file as image and it cant crop and throws error. So how can I check for modified extensions that is the uploaded file is actually an image file.p  pjqueryp  precode             var oFReader  new FileReader             var file  document.getElementByIduploadImage.files[0]            var fileType  file.type           alertfileType           var ValidImageTypes  [imagegif, imagejpeg, imagejpg, imagepng]           if .inArrayfileType, ValidImageTypes lt 0            alertinvalid file type                      else                 stuff to crop the image            codepre  pThis only checks for image files its nice, but if .doc extension is changed to .png extension and tried to upload it treats it as image file. So how can I detect that if the file is actually an image file.p

Negative 1117 pIm trying to write a method in GWT to override the series.show function for all Highcharts series, on show I want to essentially copy the series, remove the series from the chart, and readd it so that showing the series will redraw the line instead of the default behavior where the line appears and the chart redraws. I have this modeled in a Jsfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netax3o8uf316 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netax3o8uf316a p  pI used Moxies highcharts wrapper for GWT and used the setSeriesPlotOptions method to set the series show event handler and call this native method from inside the onShow.p  precodepublic static native void showSeriesJavaScriptObject series, JavaScriptObject chart          var options  series.options         options.color  series.color         options.index  series.index         options.marker.symbol  series.symbol          series.remove          options.visible  true         chart.addSeriesoptions      codepre  pand everything worked fine. Then we updated the projects highcharts and highstock.js files and it broke everything. Now hiding and showing a series in the legend will cause it to redraw fine for the first series you do it for, but as soon as you try and show another series it breaks and goes back to the default functionality for all series. Any ideas on what Im doing wrong or what might be causing it to not work after showing a second series on the graphp

Negative 1117 pI have a graph structure with a root node, several container nodes Ill call them lvl1 each containing hundreds of thousands of content nodes lvl2. The content nodes may be linked with arbitrary numbers of other content nodes. Lvl1 nodes will never link to each other and link to their lvl2 nodes exactly once. When the graph gets constructed, links between lvl2 nodes may appear multiple times, in that case I need to keep count of the links increment a codedepthcode property on the appropriate edge. Also the order of construction will be quite random.p  pIm looking for an efficient way to manage that graph structure with orientDB. Building it up is eays, the problem is updating lvl2 nodes adding more links and links between them.p  pOne way to select could be a standard SQLquery, something like codeSELECT FROM lvl2nodes WHERE id  114code  but this would query the whole dataset and be very slow, as far as I can see I didnt test that yet.p  pSo my idea was to use index lookups. I created automatic indexing codeCREATE INDEX lvl2node.id UNIQUEcode and tried to query that codeSELECT FROM INDEXlvl2node.id WHERE key  114code, which gives me a tuple codekey 114, rid ltODocument lvl2node81id114,in[2],out[1] v1gtcode.p  pNow, how can I p  pa use that information to select a node and update its properties and p  pb find the edge between 2 such vertices to perform an update similarlyp  pOr is there a better method to update a graphs vertices, exploiting the graph structure A lvl1 nodes will still contain very many links that would need to be traversed without the hashmaps approach.p  pIm using Clojures cljorient API to access orientDB.p

Negative 1117 pIm working on a project which is a UI framework written in JavaScript.

The JSON configuration also defines actions on the widgets and relationships between them.p  pWe currently have halfdecent JSDoc on the underlying JS widgets, however its only partly useful for people trying to build these models, especially if they dont have the time available to fully understand the underlying widgets and why should they. The underlying framework  and the resultant JS App  uses pubsub and so the definition of messages also needs to be documented. emAn example of this pubsub messaging would be where a button on the page should publish a specific message, which means that a service on the page should pick that up and then do something specific.emp  pI cannot seem to find any suitable means of documenting the possible ways of constructing the models, especially when it comes to what can be nested, what can be configured, etc.p  pAny suggestionsp
