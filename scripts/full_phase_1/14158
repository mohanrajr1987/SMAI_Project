Positive 14158 pIm new to Azure App Services and Im not getting the point about Azure API Apps access control. As I understood, the API Apps services has built in features to enable authentication on the API using Azure ActiveDirectory or thirdparty services.p  pIn my case, Im studying to use this with ASP.NET 5 REStful services capabilities. In that way, Ill usually need to authorize or not the access to some endpoint based on the claims a user might have, because in order to authorize or not something is a matter of business rules instead of a simple allowdeny based on login.p  pAs I understood, Azure will just take care of authentication, it will redirect the client to the identity provider, will get the token and generate another token which will allow access to the API. But, how this connects with my app Is it possible, working that way, to deal with claims for users If so, how is this donep  pIm a little in doubt, because Im failing to see how this really connects with my app, in the sense of allowing me to do what Im already used to do.p

I feel like it is not optimal since the notification comes from Github, and not from Azure which is where the deployment actually takes place.p  pI also want to notify New Relic when the preprod deploymentslot is swapped with prod.p  pIs it possible And what could be the best way to do this p  pMaybe webjobs could be the soulution This should be a webjob that only runs once after webapp is deployed and deploymentslot is swapped for prod. I cannot find any information about setting up such job.p

Positive 14158 pI have a node server deployed to azure and am using Edge.js to make some WCF calls. When I host the server locally, everything works great because I can put the .NET config for the web service calls in node.exe.config located next to my local node.exe as recommended a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17170174loadwcfappconfigbindingsinedgejsapp2348048123480481herea.p  pHowever, this does not seem feasible for a node server hosted on azure. Azure doesnt seem to let user arbitrarily put files on their file systems on whatever machine the users server happens to be currently running on which is completely reasonable.

Positive 14158 pGday, I am relatively fresh to Azure so bare with me on this  as a disclaimer I warn that there may be malformed understandings going on here, hopefully not, but maybe.p  pstrongThe Situationstrongp  pThere is an existing Windows VB Timesheet Application that deploys on customers Windows devices not RT. This application creates a local SQL express store and synchronises with an Azure SQL DB via SQL data sync.p  pThe Azure SQL DB further sychronises with a master DB also via SQL data sync that is stored locally where I am contracted, the master data is typically only changed in this master DB and the transactional data is what is synced up to azure.p  pThe tables the application is working with are all under the dbo schema.p  pI am working on creating a Xamarin Forms mobile iOS, WP8, Droid, and maybe winRT, using a PCL version of the application wordy, but you get the idea that uses an Azure Mobile Service that points to the Azure SQL DB. It only uses a subset of the features as of now.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pNow the problem as it may be obvious already is that I need access to most of the tables, of which are under the dbo schema, and I was hoping  wondering what the best practice would be to solve this.p  pIf I could point my Azure Mobile Service to use the dbo schema and give the generated login the appropriate privileges manually  scripted. This is needed for my migration of the tables to include the required system properties an so fourth.p  pAnother proposition would be to add the system columns required for azure mobile services sync operations to the master db, push them up to the azure db and then create views of all the required data in the mobile services schema. I do not yet know if this would result in any limitations to the service.p  pThere is always of course the option of moving all the data to a schema other than dbo  however this requires extension work on the other systems, which may consume considerable time particularly due to my unfamiliarity with them.p  pAny relevant information, discussion or advice would be thoroughly appreciated.p  pCheers.p

Negative 14158 pBased on all my reading there should be one GC thread to invoke all finalizers.

When the   program shuts, the garbage collector   will endeavour to call the finalizers   of all finalizable objects, but with   certain limitationsp      ul   lipFinalizable objects are not promoted   to higher heap generations during   shutdown.pli   lipAny individual finalizer will have a   maximum of 2 seconds to execute if it   takes longer it will be killed off.pli   lipThere is a maximum of 40 seconds for   all finalizers to be executed if any   finalizers are still executing, or   pending at this point the whole   process is abruptly killed off.pli   ul blockquote  pToo many posts and even official documentation misuse of the terms application, process and application domain  most of them even assuming that they are equal, because usually applications are run in a single application domain in a single process. This misuse makes all of these docs hard to read, and not even useful.p  pSo, my question assumes more than one applications, each run in a separate application domain in a single process.p  pDoes all these application share the same GC and finalizer threads Does the problem described in the article above hang finalizer thread will affect all applications in that process If yes  is there a workaround besides to not use bad applications, like somehow to discover the finalizer thread and send it Thread.Abortp  pAll above is because I hit similar problem. My application runs in a separate application domain as addin to third party software Outlook. Because of various reasons I need to call GC.Collect and GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers to fully release COM references the usual interop routines are not enough for OfficeOutlook, when a particular other third party addin is running, my GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers hangs forever, so I suspect that there is a bad finalizer in that third party adding. I have no control over replacingremoving that adding clients requirement, so I have to figure out on my own how to make them coexist.p

They are basically a simpler aspx, for when you dont need the entire page life cycle. A common use is for retrieving dynamic images from a database.p blockquote  pSo if I write a Http handler, I should put it in a file with .ashx extension and Asp.Net will build an HttpHandler object  similarly to how it builds a page instance from .aspx file p  pbr p  blockquote   p If a hacker did try to make a request for one of these files, what would you want to happen You certainly wouldnt want IIS to treat it like a text file and send the source for your app down to the browser.p blockquote  pAsp.Net could do the same it does with .cs, .csproj, .config, .resx, .licx, .webinfo file types. Namely, it registers these file types  with IIS so that it can explicitly prevent users from accessing these filesp  pbr p  blockquote   pJust because you dont expect requests from the browser for a resource, it doesnt mean you dont want that resource handled by the asp.net engine. These extensions are also how ASP.Net picks up files to compile for the web site model sites.p blockquote  pBut then why doesnt Asp.Net also allow .cs, .csproj, .config, .resx, .licx, .webinfo files to be directly requested p  pbr br p  blockquote   pa    and c  as far as I am aware, these are not exposed to process any external requestsp blockquote  pmy book claims the two are mapped in IISp  pbr br p  pI appreciate your helpp  pEDIT br p  blockquote   pb The .ashx extention is defined in a config file its just not the web.config, its in the machine.config p      pcodeltadd path.ashx verb typeSystem.Web.UI.SimpleHandlerFactory validateTrue gtcode    br    a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybya7fh0a.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybya7fh0a.aspxap      pWhy use .ashx The difference is that the .NET class that handles a .ashx reads the Page directive in the .ashx file to map the request to a class specified in that directive. This saves you from having to put an explicit path in the web.config for every handler that you have, which could result in a very long web.config.p blockquote  pI thought Http handler class was defined inside .ashx file, but instead file with .ashx extension only contains Page directivep  pSince Im not 100 sure if I understand this correctly Say  we have ten Http handlers we want to invoke by making a request to IIS7. I assume for each Http handler there will be specific .ashx file  thus if request is made for FirstHandler.asxh, then handler specified inside that file will be invokedp  pstrongYET ANOTHER EDITstrong br br  I must confess that Im still a bit unsure about ashx extension. br p  pI realize that by using it we can for example create hey.ashx page, where Page directive will tell which class  Http handler to invoke when request is made for hey.ashx  thus no need to register Http handler in web.config.  br p  pBut if you use Http handlers that way, then they will only get invoked when requests are made for files with .ashx extension. Thus, if I want Http handler to be invoked for files with other extensions, such as .sourceC, then I will still need to register Http handler in web.configp

Negative 14158 pI am using a JWindow object in my Java application to simulate a mouseover dropdown menu.  When the user mouses over a JLabel, the window appears and remains until the mouse exits either the label or the newly visible window.

When setVisibletrue is called on the JDialog, the focus is taken away from my frame.  The color of the title bar changes to indicate this, which looks unprofessional.p  pUsing an undecorated JFrame, both of the above problems occurredp  pI do not wish to use a JInternalFrame as that would require a complete redesign of my interface switching to the JDesktopPane structure, and I do not require any of the other functionality of the JInternalFrame.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 14158 pIm trying to figure out how to convert a files or directorys byte size into kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, etc... respectively according the files or directorys size so that is matches what the Finder displays in the panel when you hit Get Info.p  pThe byte size I get perfectly matches the byte size as reported in Finder, but I cant figure out how to get the files size as displayed by the Finder in KB, MB, GB, etc to match.p  pI know in 10.6 we use base 10, so a kilobyte is 1000 bytes and not 1024, but dividing the byte count by 1000 or 10002, 10003, etc doesnt match what the Finder reports.p  pFor instance, in the Finder a 330byte text file is displayed as a 4KB file so my initial guess would be to roundup all file sizes to 4KB figures, but 389,022byte directory is displayed as a 418KB way more than roundingup to 4KB, so my guess is wrong. Also a 1,315,291,136byte file is displayed as 1.33GB.p  pSo can anyone please be so kind as to shed some light here How are these figures calculated Ive looked all around and havent been able to find an answer.p  pThanks in advance for your helpp  pP.S. Ive always been 100 Cocoaoriented since I started programming and Ive never used the Carbon framework before I know its very powerful, I just dont know how to use it. I mention this just in case anyone wants to give me a Carbon solution assuming I know how to use it. I dont.p

Negative 14158 pI have developed a Java aplication that is currently being run by doubleclicking on a .bat file that does something like java jar proy.jar. This application just listens on a port and writes to a database, so it does not have any user interface such as a window. I need this application to run as in background mode, or as it were a service, but I dont really anything more than that. Its enough if the application is run in a way that is not noticeable by the user, so that the user is not bothered and so the application can not be mistakenly closed. By the way, this will be run on an specific computer so its okay if I have to do any manual configuration ir order to make this work.

Negative 14158 pIm trying to write a free mobile app that would make payments merchantagnostic for the customer. p  pContext Most webapps are merchant centric and allow for multiple payment types from the customer. But the problem Im trying to additionally solve is to have, say, a mobile app that is capable of paying as many merchants as possible using your debit, credit or PayPal account. It shouldnt rely on permerchant technical partnerships to work. It should just be able to talk to any merchant after writing the upfront code.p  pThere are a few solutions that come to mind Integrate with VISA, Mastercard, or PayPal. However, my goal is to integrate with stores that sometimes only take debit, sometimes only VISA, sometimes only PayPal, etc, while reinventing the wheel as little as possible. Im wondering if anybody has already solved a problem like this before p  ol liWhich APIs are the easiest to integrate against Could you name a fewli liAre there well known merchantaggregating APIs that are already very popular Do they cover much larger merchants like Costco and Walmartli liAre there partnership costs with say VISA I need to be aware ofli liIs there one API to rule them all that would aggregate even across Debit, VISA, PayPal, etc to reduce things to one integration pointli ol  pI need this for a free consumer Android app and would really appreciate any help I can get  especially if its costeffective.p  pBest Aminp

Negative 14158 pI am trying to draw point sprites with OpenGL ES on iPhone. Its possible there could be very many of them 1000 and up to 64 pixels wide maybe thats my problem right there  is there a limit or could I be using too much memoryp  pI am using CADisplayLink to time the frames. What happens is that the first gl drawing function tends to delay or stall when either the point count is too high or when the point size is too big. In my example below, glClear is the first drawing function, and it can take anywhere from 0.02 seconds to 0.2 seconds to run. If I simply comment out glClear, glDrawArrays becomes the slow function it runs very fast otherwise.p  pThis example is what Ive stripped my code down to in order to isolate the problem. It simply draws a bunch of point sprites, with no texture, all in the same spot. I am using VBOs to store all the sprite data position, color, size. It may seem like overkill for the example but of course I have intentions to modify this data later.p  pThis is the views init function minus the boilerplate gl setupp  precodeglDisableGLDEPTHTEST glDepthMaskGLFALSE  glDisableGLLIGHTING glDisableGLFOG  glEnableGLTEXTURE2D glEnableGLBLEND   glBlendEquationOESGLFUNCADDOES  glClearColor0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0  glTexEnvfGLTEXTUREENV, GLTEXTUREENVMODE, GLMODULATE glTexEnviGLPOINTSPRITEOES, GLCOORDREPLACEOES, GLTRUE glEnableGLPOINTSPRITEOES  glEnableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY glEnableClientStateGLPOINTSIZEARRAYOES glEnableClientStateGLCOLORARRAY  glBlendFuncGLSRCALPHA, GLONE  glEnableGLPOINTSMOOTH  glGenBuffers1, ampvbo                    vbo is an instance variable glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, vbo  glMatrixModeGLPROJECTION glOrthof0.0, [self frame].size.width, 0.0, [self frame].size.height, 1.0f, 1.0f glViewport0, 0, [self frame].size.width, [self frame].size.height   glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW  glTranslatef0.0f, [self frame].size.height, 0.0f glScalef1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f   codepre  pAnd this is the rendering functionp  precode voidrender      glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT     This function runs slowly      int pointCount  1000       fyi...      typedef struct       CGPoint point      CFTimeInterval time      GLubyte r, g, b, a      GLfloat size       MyPoint      glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, sizeofMyPointpointCount, NULL, GLDYNAMICDRAW     MyPoint  vboBuffer  MyPoint glMapBufferOESGLARRAYBUFFER, GLWRITEONLYOES      for int i  0 i lt pointCount i          vboBuffer[i].a  GLubyte0xFF         vboBuffer[i].r  GLubyte0xFF         vboBuffer[i].g  GLubyte0xFF         vboBuffer[i].b  GLubyte0xFF         vboBuffer[i].size  64.0         vboBuffer[i].point  CGPointMake200.0, 200.0           glUnmapBufferOESGLARRAYBUFFER      glPointSizePointerOESGLFLOAT, sizeofMyPoint, void offsetofMyPoint, size     glColorPointer4, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, sizeofMyPoint, void offsetofMyPoint, r     glVertexPointer2, GLFLOAT, sizeofMyPoint, void offsetofMyPoint, point      glDrawArraysGLPOINTS, 0, pointCount      [context presentRenderbufferGLRENDERBUFFEROES]  codepre  pWhy is the glClear function stalling It doesnt just delay in random amounts  depending on the point count or size, it tends to randomly delay in the same intevals eg. 0.015 sec, 0.030 sec, 0.045 sec, etc. Also something strange I noticed is that if I switch to glBlendModeGLZERO, GLONE, it runs just fine although this is will not be the visual effect Im after. Other glBlendMode values change the speed as well  usually for the better. That makes me think it is not a memory issue because that has nothing to do with the VBO right.p  pI admit I am a bit new at OpenGL and may be misunderstanding basic concepts about VBOs or other things.

Negative 14158 pIm trying to write a method to take a multiline tabdelimited file and return the contents of that file as an arraylist of String arrays each line is a String[], and each such String[] is an element of an arraylist. My problem is, I cant tell if the output is correct or not. Ive printed each arraylist element and String[] element as they are saved to the arraylist, and those printings look correct.

Still, codeusernamecode wasnt the best one to use RedFilter makes valid points about user identity, particularly when the records are presented in a public context.p  pRegarding emWhy isnt username the primary keyem this is just an example, but if I apply this to a real problem Ill be needing to work within the constraints of an existing system that assumes the existence of a surrogate primary key.p

Negative 14158 pI have an ATL exe server written with C Visual Studio 2010, with merging the proxystud dll. The executable is compiled for Windows 7 x86 amp x64. The following happens on both architecturesp  pThe ATL exe server should function as a server process, that is  one process MyATLServer.exe, ONLY one should exists per machine and many clients lets keep it simple on the same machine are consuming COM objects from it. The server saves application state in memory and all clients should share this sate, by using the servers exposed COM objects.p  pThe exe server usually starts when the system starts because it is invoked by a COM call to create one of its hosted objects. The call originates from within the spoolsv.exe process Print spooler service. This causes the server process to run under the SYSTEM user I guess due to the fact that spoolsv.exe runs with SYSTEM.p  pWhen one of the clients creates a COM object from the ATL server, another process MyATLServer.exe again is instantiated running under the user whos logged in to Windows, thus, it cannot share application state with the original one which is running under SYSTEM. A second client will connect to the one instantiated by the logged in user the second one.p  pAfter searching countless forums on the WEB Ive managed to get to the following conclusionsp  p1 My ATL server uses the default autogenerated by VS2010 ATLModule which inherits from ATLCAtlExeModuleTlt. Digging into the ATL headers Im positive that this module calls AtlComModuleRegisterClassObjects with the correct flags for this kind of use dwClsContext  CLSCTXLOCALSERVER, flags  REGCLSMULTIPLEUSE  REGCLSSUSPENDED. So it rules this one out.p  p2 Using start  run  dcomcnfg  DCOM Config  MyATLServer  Properties Ive set the This user option under the Identity tab with the local administrator user. In the Location tab, the option Run application on this computer is not selected and grayedout. This caused me to search again and I got here a hrefhttpsocial.technet.microsoft.comForumsenUSw7itprosecuritythread4f63ee11e47240f985dba6b235d7579c relnofollowhttpsocial.technet.microsoft.comForumsenUSw7itprosecuritythread4f63ee11e47240f985dba6b235d7579ca. The link explains that the x64 version of the dcomcnfg utility is buggy and one should use the 32bit version of it on x64 Windows startrunmmc comexp.msc 32. After checking it on two system one of each I found out that the Run application on this computer option is grayed out and not selected on both.p  pFrom this point Im totally lost and trying to suppress the frustration... . Am I on the correct path Did anyone do this beforep  pOr the original intent  How do I make my ATL exe server singledprocessedp  pThanksp  pOmrip

Negative 14158 pI couldnt find a satisfying answer to this, so here we go whats the deal with codeActivityService.getApplicationcode and codeContext.getApplicationContextcodep  pIn our application, both return the same object. In an codeActivityTestCasecode however, mocking the application will make codegetApplicationcode come back with the mock, but codegetApplicationContextcode will still return a different context instance one injected by Android. Is that a bug Is it on purposep  pI dont even understand the difference in the first place. Are there cases outside a test suite where both calls may come back with different objects When and why Moreover, why is codegetApplicationcode defined on codeActivitycode and codeServicecode, but not on codeContextcode Shouldnt there always be a valid application instance available from emanywhereemp

Negative 14158 pMy application has two database tables codeProductscode and codeShoppingCardcode. So I created a codeProductContentProvidercode and codeShoppingCardContentProvidercode. Each codeContentProvidercode invokes in its codeonCreatecode method a private class that is child of codeSQLiteOpenHelpercode.p  ol lipFrom my point of view I would make a global static variable codeDATABASEVERSIONcode in a strongseparatedstrong emConfigBeanem that is responsible for strongbothstrong content providers. So if I update that all tables are updated.br  That does not work. Simply the onUpdate event is never fired.pli lipIf you specify a codeDATABASEVERSIONcode in each content provider, but with strongdifferentstrong version numbers in each content providerbr  That does not work. Also it makes no sense, from my point of view, because the paramater in codeSQLiteOpenHelpercode is called codeDATABASEVERSIONcode strongnotstrong codeTABLEVERSIONcode. So in other words, you cannot update any table without updatingthrowing an event on all emonUpgradeem listeners.pli lipIf you specify a codeDATABASEVERSIONcode in each content provider, but with strongequalstrong version numbers in each content provider.br  That works.pli ol  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pWhy cant you make the codeDATABASEVERSIONcode a public static variable outside to handle upgrades globaly, or am I completely on the wrong path with my architecturep

I tried on different computers and all have the same result.p  pI also checked the uploaded file and it is the new one.p  pIf I delete the file I get the error what is normal.

Negative 14158 pI have a stored procedure that looks up a users preferences based on the fact that they can select multiple locations that they want to search in. So, for each location, the query needs to lookup results within the area. Currently, the procedure only returns 1 result. Also, I would like to be able to implement some kind of ranking system in order to sort the results as one combined feed.

Some browsers detect repeated dialog boxes and longrunning scripts and give the user   the option to stop them. But malicious code can use methods such as setInterval to   load the CPU and can also attack your system by allocating lots of memory. There is   no general way that web browsers can prevent this kind of hamhanded attack. In   practice, this is not a common problem on the Web since no one returns to a site that   engages in this kind of scripting abusep blockquote

Negative 14158 pI have a huge dataset around 5 000 000 rows in a database which I want to represent as a graph. For algorithmic reasons it is required to store the dataset in a adjacency matrix. The Matrix will be strongvery sparse and symmmetricstrong.p  pFirst I thought of storing the graph in a database table. This would require 5 000 000 rows, which should be no problem. But 5 000 000 columns I dont know much of databases but I have the feeling, that this would be no recommended way of doing this.p  pAfter some searching within google, I found SciPy which has several Sparse Matrix Objects. lilmatrix and coomatrix seem to be what I need.p  pSince I will operate on this matrix using python, SciPy seems a good why to go. The question for me now is how to store the graph aka sparse matrixp  pShould I use a csv file Should I use coomatrix to save the matrix into a daatabasetable Both would result into around 2 500 000 000 000 rowslinesp  pOr is there a far better way for creating and storing such a symmetric and sparse Matrix of dimension around 5 000 000 in pythonp  pI am using numpy and some self written algorithms in python, which I want to run on the matrix. So it would be cool, if the suggestions make it easy to use python on the graph.p  pI dont know if I provided enough information for an answer.

Negative 14158 pWe have a 160 project VS2010 C solution.  I start with a completely empty output directory, and Build Solution.  I have the IDE build verbosity set to Normal.

I dont know any project settings that affect build output I think its controlled by only IDElevel settings.

After a while, we manage to bring the original namenode to life with exact previous configuration. We stop the namenode process on the remote machine. Now, will the local fs.name.dir be synchronized with the mounted one I mean the diff which was accumulated on the mounted dir, while the original namenode was down or there will be a problem with namenode data consistency  p

Negative 14158 pIm trying to build an app, which should have Flash Player control, which plays SWF from server certain URL. For Flash Player ActiveX you have to save SWF file to a temporary location to load it and play, isnt it Youll have to create a corresponding link that you can pass to the Flash Player ActiveX and then delete SWF file after it is played. Of course, high security level cant be guaranteed, but I think its good, if at least no temporary files are created can be intercepted LOCALLY. So the question is how to make Flash Player ActiveX be able to load SWF file directly from any source without usage of temp files Thank youp

I dont know if I was at this for too long and my brain is fried but Im getting confused about the boolean statement used as an argument in the function constructor. See line 8.p  pThis is the explanation given by the tutorial p  blockquote   pThe constructor function is used to initialize the object when we   want to load an ACL. It is called automatically when we call new   ACL. It is then passed a single, optional argument of the user to   load the ACL for. Inside the constructor, we check to see if a user ID   was passed in. If no ID was passed, we assume that we will load the   ACL for the currently logged in user so we read in the session   variable for that. Alternatively, if we pass in a user ID, it allows   us to read and edit the ACL for a user other than the one logged in   useful for your admin page.p blockquote  psQuestion 1... so this method is starting up as soon as you make a new class, and it is taking the boolean as an argument. Im not understanding why you need to state the fact that userID   . Couldnt you just make it simpler and write function constructoruserID  if userID   ........etc. etc.  Or do they mean the same thing  The idea of stating a boolean never made sense to me, especially when youre not using it in an IF statement to test its validity. sp  pEDIT I made a very weird slip. Sorry disregard the whole boolean thing, its not even a boolean statement. My error... 12 hours of learning programming is taking its toll.p  pQuestion 2 Is the variable userID in line 5 the same as userID in line8 Im thinking no but Im not sure. Im sure that userID on line 5 is the same as thisuserID on line 12 and line 15 but what about on line 8 and 10 I am confused. If the variable userID on line 8 is NOT blank, then you are assigning userID found on line 5 to the floatval of userID on line 8 I have a feeling that these are 2 different userIDs. Why couldnt this guy just use a different word if thats the case LOLp  pNOTE Ive been learning PHP for less than a week so these will seem like basic conceptual questions more than anything.

Negative 14158 pI have a thread pool executor which I would like to monitor for excessive resource usage time since cpu and memory seem to be quite harder. I would like to kill threads that are running too long, like killing an OS process. The workers spend most time calculating, but significant time is also spent waiting for IO, mostly database...p  pI have been reading up on stopping threads in java and how it is deprecated for resource cleanup reasons not properly releasing locks, closing sockets and files and so on. The recommended way is to periodically check in a worker thread whether it should stop and then exit. This obviously expect that client threads be written in certain ways and that they are not blocked waiting on some external IO. There is also ThreadDeth and InterruptedException which might be able to do the job, but they may actually be circumvented in improperlymalicously written worker threads, and also I got an impression though no testing yet they InterruptedException might not work properly in some or even all cases when the worker thread is waiting for IO.p  pAnother way to mitigate it would be to use multiple OS processes to isolate parts of the system, but it brings some unwanted increases in resource consumption.p  pThat led me to that old story about isolates andor MVM from more than five years ago, but nothing seems to have happened on that front, maybe in java 8 or 9...p  pSo, actually, this all has made me to wander whether some poor mans simulation of processes could be achieved through using threads that would each have their own classloader Could that be used to simulate processes if each thread or group would be loaded in its own classloader I am not sure how much an increase in resource consumption would that bring as there would not be much code sharing and code is not tiny. At least process copyonwrite semantics enable code sharing..p  pAny recommendationsideasp  pEDITp  pI am asking because of general interest and kind of disappointment that no solutions for this exist in the JVM to date I mean shared application servers are not really possible  application domains, or something like that, in .NET seem to address exactly this kind of problem. I understand that killing a process does not guarantee reverting all system state to some initial condition, but at least all resorces like handles, memory and cpu are released. I was thinking of using classloaders since they emmightem help with releasing locks held by the thread, which is one of the reasons that Thread.stop is deprecated. In my current situation the only other thing should be released I can think of currently is database connection, that could be handled separatelyexternally by watchdog thread if needed.. Though, really, in my case Thread.stop might actually be workable, I just dislike using deprecated methods..p  pAlso I am considering this as a safety net for misbehaving processes, Ideally they should behave nicely, and are in a quite high degree under my control.p  pSo, to clarify, I am asking how do for example java people on the server side handle runaway threads I suspect by using many machines in the cluster to offset the problem and restarting misbehaving ones  when the application is stateless at least..p

Negative 14158 pIm doing some personal research into text analysis, and have come up with close to 70 metrics pronoun usage frequency, reading levels, vowel frequency, use of bullet points, etc to score a piece of text. p  pIdeally, separate pieces of text from the same author would have similar scores. The ultimate goal is to index a great deal of authors, and use scores to guess at who wrote a separate, anonymous piece of text. p  pId like the scores to normalize from 0 to 100 and represent a percentage of how similar two pieces of text are in writing style. Questions like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7041867howtodecideonweightsHow to decide on weightsa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions994819howtocalculatescoresHow to calculate scoresa describe the math behind scoring metrics and how to normalize, but assume every metric is weighted the same.p  pstrongMy question is this how do I determine the proper weight to use when scoring each metric, to ensure that the cumulative score peruser most accurately describes the writing from that specific userstrongp  pAlso, weights can be assigned peruser. If syllables per word most aptly describes who wrote a piece for Alice, while the frequency of twoletter words is the best for Bob, Id like Alices heaviest weight to be on syllables per word, and Bobs to be on frequency of twoletter words.p

Negative 14158 pJust looking for a bit of direction, I realise that the example given is possible to solve using brute force iteration, but I am looking for a more elegant ie. mathematical solution which could potentially solve significantly larger examples say 20x20 or 30x30. It is entirely possible that this cannot be done, and I have had very little success in coming up with an approach which does not rely on brute force...p  pI have a matrix call it A which is nxn. I wish to select a subset call it B of points from matrix A. The subset will consist of n elements, where one and only one element is taken from each row and from each column of A. The output should provide a solution B such that the sum of the elements that make up B is the maximum possible value, given these constraints eg. 25 in the example below. If multiple instances of B are found ie. different solutions which give the same maximum sum the solution for B which has the largest minimum element should be selected. p  pB could also be a selection matrix which is nxn, but where only the n desired elements are nonzero.p  pFor example if A p  precode5 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 5 3 2 1 5 4 2 1 5 4 3 1 5 4 3 2 codepre  p B would bep  precode5 5 5 5 5 codepre  pHowever, if A  p  precode5 4 3 4 3 2 3 2 1 codepre  pB p  precode3 3 3 codepre  pAs the minimum element of B is 3 which is larger than for p  precode5 3 1 codepre  porp  precode4 4 1 codepre  pwhich also both sum to 9p

But now, when I have migrated to tapestry v5.2.6, there are conflicts in the javascripts. If I comment out jquery js import in a page, zone works i.e. gets updated but dialog doesnt work and if  I include jquery js in the page, the dialog works perfectly, but it shows error for zone updation event  saying Element selectZone does not have an associated Tapestry.ZoneManager object.  p  pSo basically, I need to use both jQuery and prototype js together in the page for tapestry v5.2.6.

Negative 14158 pId like to write a little program just to display the CPU usage as a percent, like the task manager does. I know intermediate C and Java.

Negative 14158 pI want to have several classes of draggables, each one corresponding to a class of droppables. But in addition, I want to have a separate waste bin, where all the draggables can be dropped until a suitable droppable can be found for them.p  pNow, this can be easily achieved with an accept function. However, I may have up to 20 classes, each one with 3040 draggablesdroppables. So if I use an accept function for this, the moment I pick up a draggable, my chrome freezes as it runs tests for every droppable on the screen p  pThis can be solved if I use the scope property, since it seems to be using some different way. However, when I use a scope, I cant seem to implement the waste bin concept, since it can only have one scopep  pIs there some way to bypass this problem Give the draggables more than one scope, or giving the waste bin many scopes Or maybe some other solution I cant think ofp

Negative 14158 pI have created a Windows 8 Metro App based on the Split Page sample app.  However, in the sample app the data is loaded synchronously in the constructor.  Im accessing a text file and therefore need to load the data asynchronously.  The constructor looks like thisp  precode    public MyDataSource              DataLoaded  false          LoadData      codepre  pcodeLoadDatacode is an asynchronous method that populates the data model.  This works fine, and displays the data as is loads it which is the behavior that I want.  The problem occurs when I try testing the suspend and terminate.  The problem being that the recovery has the potential to attempt to access the data model before it is populatedp  precode    public static MyDataGroup GetGroupstring uniqueId               If the data hasnt been loaded yet then what         if myDataSource  null                   Where app has been suspended and terminated there is no data available yet                    Simple linear search is acceptable for small data sets         var matches  myDataSource.AllGroups.Wheregroup gt group.UniqueId.EqualsuniqueId         if matches.Count  1 return matches.First         return null      codepre  pI can fix this by changing the constructor to call codeLoadData.Waitcode, but this means that the app locks the UI thread.  What I believe I need is a method of getting the recovery code in codeGetGroupcode to wait until the data has loaded without locking the UI thread.  Is this possible or advisable, and if so, howp  pEDITp  pOne or two people have suggested caching the task for codeLoadDatacode.  This is an excellent idea, but the code inside codeGetGroupcode is called by the Page State Management section and therefore cannot be async.  To get around this, I tried the followingp  precodeif DataLoaded      dataLoading  await MyDataSource.LoadData     dataLoading.RunSynchronously  codepre  pBut this gives me an errorp  precodeRunSynchronously may not be called on a task not bound to a delegate, such as the task returned from an asynchronous method. codepre  pand p  precodedataLoading.Wait codepre  pjust locks the UI.p
Negative 14158 pI stumbled upon the following problem.br I want a hashset with all numbers from 1 to 100.000.000. I tried the following codep  precodevar mySet  new HashSetltintgt for var k  1 k lt 100000000 k      mySet.Addk codepre  pThat code didnt make it since I got memory overflow somewhere around the 49mil.

Negative 14158 pI would like to build the hierarchy dynamically with each node created as a layerlevel in the hierarchy having its own array of nodes. THIS SHOULD FORM A TREE STRUCTURE.There should be a root node, and an undefined number of nodes and levels to make up the hierarchy size. Nothing should be fixed besides the root node.  I do not need to read or search the hierarchy, I need to construct it. The array should start name  A,  children  [] and every new node as levels would be created name  A,  children  [HEREname  A,  children  []]. In the child array, going deeper and deeper. Basically the array should have no values before the call, except maybe the root node. After the function call, the array should comprise of the required nodes of a number that may vary with every call depending on the results of a database query. Every child array will contain one or more node values. There should be a minimum of 2 node levels, including the root. It should initially be a Blank canvas, that is no predefined array values.p

Negative 14158 pIm developing in Symfony2 with FOSUserBundle and I am not very sure about DDBB Design. I will try to explain my situation as simple as possible. Lets we say that my project is like facebook. So you know that the Entity User would be the most important and relevant in the whole application, and everything is related with it.p  pThe point is that I am not sure of how handle DB layer tables, doctrine entities and relations working with FOSUserBundle. By default, entity User must have all FOSUserBundle fields username, email, token, emailcanonical, so on....  So my doubt is whether I should create another entity to handle relations with other entities, something like UserReal. It would have relation OneToOne with the first entity User, witch will be used only for login or access purposes. Or just create one object User and handle everything with it.p  pMy optionsp  p1.  There is Entity UserSecurity witch extends FosUserBundle User entity, and only is limited to be used in access login, logout, registration cases.  There is Entity UserReal, or just User witch has every fields propers from an User name, surname, location. It has relations with other entities like pages, groups, photos. It is the main entity, witch has strategy for generated values.  UserSecurity has a relation OneToOne to User through UserSecurityiduser.  Registration must insert both entities.p  ol lipthe other way aroundp  ul liLike point 1, but the main entity is UserSecurity, so id will be in there and the strategy for generated values too.li liUser entity, will have field iduser with relation OneToOne to UserSecurity.li ulli lipUse one objectp  ul liExtends FOSUserBundle in one entity and set all relations to it.li liI dont like this becouse I need a clean object User who dont have security options.li ulli ol  pI am thinking that facebook has a lot of User entity instances one for each friend for instance, but only one instance for user logged, so will be wrong if we use this for everything.p  pI would like to know other opinionssuggestions.p  pI hope that it was not be confused or I did not make confused.p  pMany thanks in advance.p

I have taken this approach in my Azure MVC application and configured the codeSessionSecurityTokenHandlercode like thisp  precodeFederatedAuthentication.ServiceConfigurationCreated  sender, args gt              var sessionTransforms  new ListltCookieTransformgtnew CookieTransform[]                              new DeflateCookieTransform,                 new RsaEncryptionCookieTransformargs.ServiceConfiguration.ServiceCertificate,                 new RsaSignatureCookieTransformargs.ServiceConfiguration.ServiceCertificate                      var sessionHandler  new SessionSecurityTokenHandlersessionTransforms.AsReadOnly         args.ServiceConfiguration.SecurityTokenHandlers.AddOrReplacesessionHandler                          codepre  pUsing this configuration, we are able to receive tokens from an identity provider and issue secure cookies encrypted using these transforms.  Running in the Azure emulator, everything works as expected.  However, in the Azure environment, we intermittently see the following error in the browserp  precodeKey not valid for use in specified state.

Negative 14158 pI am implementing a GUI swing Application comprising three bundles, let say bundleA, bundleB, and bundleC. I install all these three bundles inusing a separate installer bundle using BundleContext.installBundleString location method. p  pThe problem starts when I use another bundle named UpgradeBundle to update one of the three already installed bundles. To be more precise I call BundleC.updatenull method followed by the call to FrameworkWiring.refreshBundlesBundlesForRefresh, null method, as I read that bundle update requires call to FrameworkWiring.refreshBundles. However the call to FrameworkWiring.refreshBundles results in launching a new GUI application with updated bundle instead of updating it in already running application instance, while already running application keeps on running with old bundle. Any idea why this is happeningp  pIf you need more elaboration on the problem, please let me know, and I will try to explain the problem further.p  pP.S. I am using Equinox OSGi framework.p
Negative 14158 pI want to query for a collection based on the value of a count being greater than 0.  For example, I want to optimize a query where I get all dealerships with a carcount greater than 0.  My first instinct was to index based on car count in descending order.  Since well never show more than 100 dealerships or some reasonable number, this will perform well.  However, I think the index could be optimized because there is no reason for dealerships with a carcount  0 to be in that index in the first place.  Were wasting RAM.  Just FYI  not actually doing this for dealerships so its entirely possible that there will be a nontrivial amount of dealerships with a carcount  0.  How can I change the following index to ignore dealerships with a carcount  0p  precodedb.dealerships.ensureIndexcarcount1 codepre  pWill the solution make writes much more inefficient than my existing indexp

Negative 14158 pIve coded a form with various valuebindings and a knockout viewmodel behind it. The form is submitted by an AJAX post triggered by a clickbinding on a form button. Ive noticed that the model isnt correctly updated BEFORE the post when I make changes in a textfield, leave the cursor in it and directly click the submit button.p  pIm aware of the afterkeydown option of the value binding, but I prefer not to use it, since it would also trigger my validation on every key strike.

Negative 14158 pI am trying to create a page where appropriate images to load are determined by javascript, based on browser size. For examplep  precodeltimg srcimage1.jpg gt codepre  pjavascript would change it top  precodeltimg srcimage1800px.jpg gt codepre  pand load the 800px wide image version.p  pDoing this is not a problem. Problem arises when i try to do the same for browsers without javascript. The basic idea would be to hide images initially and display them with a style in NOSCRIPT tag. So browsers that support javascript will change image urls and make those images visible and browsers that dont support javascript will simply unhide those images by css. The problem is that images with displaynone are loaded by browsers. And adding image url into anything but the src attribute is not an option as such image would rely on javascript to set its src.p  pSo are there any ideas if its possible to make this workp  pFor instance i could rewrite image src attributes on domready and hope that browsers dont manage to start loading images from old src, but would that be the case If so  would it always be the case or would some browsers work differentlyp

Negative 14158 pI have two buffers open in Emacs, each in their own window, and one of those buffers is the codeMessagescode buffer for the sake of example, lets say the other buffer is codescratchcode. Most things printed to the echo area are immediately visible in the codeMessagescode buffer. In other words, if Im in codescratchcode and press codeCgcode then Quit is printed to the codeMessagescode buffer right away. If I enter codemessage hicode into the codescratchcode buffer and codeevalcode it, the codeMessagescode buffer is also updated right away.p  pHowever, when I try to call the codemessagecode function from an a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwareemacsmanualhtmlnodeelispSMIE.htmlSMIE relnofollowSMIEa coderulesfunctioncode, the codeMessagescode buffer is not updated right away, and I have to switch to it codeCx ocode in order to see it updated, or scroll it from the other buffer codeCMvcode.p  pThis is obviously trivial to work around, but printing stuff with codemessagescode is damn useful when debugging an SMIE indentation rules function, which is what Im doing. When I hit codetabcode in a particular place in my source code, sometimes this function is called more than once, with different parameters codebeforecode and codeaftercode for the same token, for instance, resulting in more than one line printed to codeMessagescode.p  pMaybe Im barking up the wrong tree, and in actual fact the SMIE rules function should never be called more than once In that case I guess this would be a bug in the lexical spec for this SMIE mode Im fiddling with codesmlmode.elcode and its called twice when the point is on a line after a definitional equals for instancep  precodeval x   codepre  pwhere the point is codecode p

Negative 14158 pI am currently looking for a design pattern or rather a best practice in implementing codeRepositoryltEntitygt.Updatecode method for a codeASP.NET MVC 4code application which uses Entity Framework 5 with Code First approach.p  pstrongProblemstrong The problem I encountered is that when an entity is queried from the database and shown on a view it may not have all the attributes populated.

However they may have some values in the database. As an example codeCustomer.Misccode in below code.p  pSo the problem comes here.

So Ive created a codeSoundEffectInstancecode starting from my codeSoundEffectcode object who contains the audio clip. Now the problem is that I have a button which should change the state of this clip from looped to non looping and viceversa.p  pHeres the problem it throws an exception sayning that the loop must be set before the first play. So I thought that, while switching from non looping to looped, I could just wait for the sound to stop and then recreate the codeSoundEngineInstancecode, setting codeIsLooped  truecode and make it start again. This one works, but theres some delay and this makes you lose your timing, so its quite useless.p  pWhat Im looking for is a way to set or unset the loop while playing the sound and without any kind of delay.p  pEDITp  pI tried using two codeSoundEngineInstancecode, one looped and one not, and simply switch between them using the volume. The problem is that the non looped one just stops after the first play, so if I loop it for two times and then I put it to non loop status, no sound is played because the non looped clip already endedp  pSuggestionsp

Negative 14158 pI have a scheduler that will fire a task emTem, and some of the parameters to emTem are very dependent on the date. For example, if emTem is run on a Tuesday, some of the parameters would bep  precodeparam1  datetimeMonday at 1pm param2  datetimeTuesday at 1am codepre  pThe parameters can vary depending on when emTem is run. So, for example, if its run on Sunday, the parameters could bep  precodeparam1  datetimeSaturday at 12pm param2  datetimeSunday at 12pm codepre  pAnd so on. The idea is that the dates are relative to when emTem is run, but I cant use codetimedeltacode because I dont know exactly when the task will be run, so I want to retain a degree of absolute control over the dates.p  pNow, the code that will start emTem has a little json package that specifies the parameters. I am in the process of writing a tiny scripting language that would allow me to specify relative date. It would look something along the lines ofp  precodedate1       type datetime,      source composite,      value YnMnDnHnNn  codepre  pThe codevaluecode string would be parsed and based on whats in the brackets, the parameters will be compiled. So, for example, if codevaluecode is something like codeYnMnD1H18N00code, it would construct the date with current year, current month, the strongpreviousstrong day, 1800. p  pAm I trying to reinvent the wheel with some of this stuff.

Negative 14158 pIs it possible to tell from an MsBuild custom task which solution the project is being built from, or which other projects are also participating in the buildp  pemEditemp  pTrying to clarify the context a bit.p  pLets say I have the following setupp  precodeCompany   LibA       LibA.csproj   LibB       LibB.csproj   App1       App1.sln  App1.csproj, LibA.csproj, LibB.csproj       App1.csproj   App2       App2.sln  App2.csproj, LibA.csproj       App2.csproj codepre  pSo as you can see both App1 and App2 use LibA and include it in the solution. However LibB is only present in one solution.p  pNow lets assume that there is a certain relationship between LibA and LibB and that this relationship is handled with a custom MsBuild task inside LibALibA.csproj. However, to do this the custom task needs to know if LibB participated in the current build or not, or alternatively if it is present in the current solution or not. Bear in mind its the same csproj file used in both solutions.p  pI dont mind doing it automatically or by adding metadata to the .sln file.p  pIs there a way to achieve thisp

The codealbumcode is an array of as many elements as pictures are given.p  pLastly each row has a codeconfig.statuscode block, which, again, has the same codeidcode as the one given in codeconfig.profilecode, and one entry of codestatuscode with the corresponding status.p  pIm entirely clueless how to create the nested and conditional JSON file.p  pI just got to the point where I convert the codeCSVcode to valid codeJSONcode, without any nesting and additional info, which are not directly given in the codeCSVcode, like the codetypecode, codepictureIdcode, codestatusIdcode, and so on.p  pAny help is appreciated. If it is easier to program this in another script language like coderubycode, I would gladly switch to those.p  pBefore someone thinks this is a homework or whatnot. It is not. I just want to automate an otherwise very tiresome copyamppaste task.p

Negative 14158 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVJlnN.png altenter image description herep  pstrongWhat the aim isstrongp  pIm relatively new to threading. Ive been trying to make QuadTree rendered terrain which    will render fast and efficiently. The amount of terrain which is currently rendered would lag the user majorly if it was all at the maximum detail. This is why Ive used a QuadTree to render it. The engine also supports Input and Physics therefore I decided to use a rendering thread. This has caused lots of problems.p  pstrongThe problemsstrong When i wasnt threading there was a bit of lag due to the other systems in the Engine. The main one that caused the lag is the loading and deletion of terrain in the QuadTree Im not even sure if this is the optimal way to do it. Now, Rendering happens very fast and it doesnt seem to lag. When the camera is standing still the game runs fine. I left the game running for an hour and no crashes were found.p  pWhen terrain is loaded it uses several of the variables the rendering code uses. Namely, binding the buffers p  precode    glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, vertexbuffer     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, vertices.size  sizeofglmvec3, ampvertices[0], GLSTATICDRAW      glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, normalbuffer     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, normals.size  sizeofglmvec3, ampnormals[0], GLSTATICDRAW      glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, uvbuffer     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, uvs.size  sizeofglmvec2, ampuvs[0], GLSTATICDRAW codepre  pThis variable I believe is being accessed at the same time as the other thread. Which causes a crash. How does one fix this I have tried using Mutexes but this doesnt seem to work. Where would I lock and unlock the mutex to fix thisp  pAnother variable that seem to cause the same error are IsLeaf.p  pAnother crash stdbadAlloc is caused after loading a lot of terrain. Even though its beeing cleaned up. I assume this is due to my deletion code but I dont know whats wrong.p  pThe way I currently add and delete the tiles is I check the range from the camera and deletecreate the tile. I want to render the tile im on and the ones around it. However, this doesnt work when transitioning from one of the 4 main tiles. Creating by using the range doesnt work as its the range to the center of the big tile rather than the smaller ones. Ive also tried deleting the whole map every few seconds and this seems to work too but with more lag. Is there a better way to do the creation and destructionp  pBetween different resolutions there are gaps. Is there anyway to reduce these Currently i render the tiles a little larger than they need to be but this doesnt help on major resolution changes. p  pIf you have any idea how to fix one of these errors itd be much appreciated.p  pstrongThe code Too much to upload herestrongp  pa hrefhttppastebin.comMwXaymG0 relnofollowhttppastebin.comMwXaymG0ap  pa hrefhttppastebin.com2tRbqtEB relnofollowhttppastebin.com2tRbqtEBa    p

Negative 14158 pThis question may be too broad, but I think its a decent question to ask, and Im not sure how to handle it.p  pIm currently hosting a website at example.com. Im doing this using 100 node.js, at the moment.

I still plan on serving the full client HTML and JavaScript using node.js, but I would like the client to connect to the C server rather than the node.js server.p  pThe way that Im currently connecting to the server is simply using a socket gained from socket.ios codeio.connectcode.

Negative 14158 pI am designing a web application, using which an end user would submit a document for processing. It takes about 510 seconds to process this document, during which a java batch processdaemon reads this document, process it through different stages. I want the user to be presented with a progress bar and textual feedback from the backend engine to the webpage. I have two methods in mind, but I am not sure what would be the best way to do this in javap  ol liPoll the app server  have an ajax client on the web page constantly hit the server ever second asking for an update. The server side code will lookup status of the document processing in a db and send a number and text back to the client  something like 10, Finished reading.. li liAsync  Have an ajax client open a connection to the app server and wait for data push from server. I am not sure how I would implement this on server side. Would using something like redis pubsub make sense here Or just a simple servlet that keeps connections open and pushes data when it has an update from the backend processli ol  pAre there any popular architecturalprogramming recipes for doing this I am open to using any third party free OSS.p
Negative 14158 pIm trying to write a webapp where the server side provides only jsonREST services, and the gui is written in html5, backbone, marionette, etc. using async XHR.

While this serves the content with no problem I cant work with this structure for development because I cant live with the time overhead of copying my changes across to a different directory.

Im really looking specifically for how to configure jboss to serve static content.p  pTIA.    p

Negative 14158 pI am a beginner programmer and I need help with some parts of my code. I am currently creating a craps game simulator, but it appears that my code wont really run. My code is attached and for a few notes, every time there is a roll of the dice, the user must hit enter which will cause the program to roll the dice.p  pFor a brief overview, here is some of the rules behind crapsp  blockquote   pEach round has two phases comeout and point. To start a round,   the shooter makes one or more comeout rolls. A comeout roll of 2,   3 or 12 loses and is called crapout. A comeout roll of 7 or 11 a   natural wins. The other possible numbers are the point numbers 4,   5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. If the shooter rolls one of these numbers on the   comeout roll, this establishes the point and continues to the point   phase. At the pointphase, if the user rolls the same number as the   comeout phase, they Hit or win the game. If they roll a 7 however,   they sevenout or lose the game. If the player doesnt get a 7 or   the same comeout number, they keep rolling until they either hit or   sevenout.p blockquote  pMy issue is that when the program runs, i am able to get Please hit enter, but when I hit enter, it wont continue to the next part of the code which will roll the dice. I cant quite figure out why that happens. Also, I may need some help looking at the logic behind my code, I am not entirely sure if when implemented, the desired results would occur.

Negative 14158 pOK, this is a bit weird.p  pSo I have many people who doing work online completing online forms. These forms are then POSTed back to the same page, which records the entry and then gives them a new entry to do.p  pThe problem is that around 1100 of the entries appears to go missing. According to my logs the PHP script thinks that these have been submitted with no POST data like a page refresh. But many users of the site are having this problem.p  pI dont see how this could be an error in my code or in the HTML form as the code amp HTML is basically the same for each pageentry.p  pIm at my wits end trying to figure out where the problem is. I put very detailed logs on the PHP script, recording everything. According to those logs the missing entries are missing because there is no POST data not even a codeREQUEST[submit]code variable set, but the users are all adamant that they pressed the submit button and did not refresh the page.p  pIs this normal Any way to fix itp  pForm looks like thisp  precodeltform actiondisplay.php methodPOSTgt lttextarea namedesc cols80 rows20gt.description.lttextareagt ltinput typehidden namesavepk value1gt ltINPUT typehidden NAMEpibn VALUE3434gt ltINPUT TYPEhidden NAMEuser VALUE12gt ltINPUT TYPEhidden NAMEwhat VALUE2gt ltinput typehidden namepk value1gt ltinput typehidden namego value0gt ltinput typehidden namedebug value0gt ltINPUT TYPEsubmit NAMEsubmit VALUEDone 10 ONCLICKparent.Switch stylewidth300height40pxfontweightboldbackgroundcolorF2FF9Egt ltformgt codepre  pThe parent page including javascript isp  precodeltHTMLgtltHEADgtltMETA NAMEROBOTS CONTENTNOINDEXgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt var on0 function Switch          if on0                  on1         document.getElementByIdframe0.style.top1000         document.getElementByIdframe1.style.top0              else                  on0         document.getElementByIdframe1.style.top1000         document.getElementByIdframe0.style.top0               ltscriptgt ltHEADgtltBODYgt ltiframe srcdisplay.php frameborder0 width100 height100 stylepositionabsolute left0 top0 classframe0 idframe0gtltiframegt ltiframe srcdisplay.php frameborder0 width100 height100 stylepositionabsolute left0 top1000 classframe1 idframe1gtltiframegt ltBODYgtltHTMLgt codepre  pThat javascript is used to load 2 of the pages at a time and alternate them.

Negative 14158 pI am still a beginner in SQL and im facing an issue. hope you can help me. I have a table called Department where it has an attribute DEPARTMENTNO as its primary key.p  precodeCREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT  DEPARTMENTNO INT NOT NULL,  NAME VARCHAR25 NOT NULL,  LOCATION CHAR15,  PRIMARY KEYDEPARTMENTNO codepre  pI have another table called Doctor where it has an attribute DNUM as a foreign key referring to DEPARTMENTNO p  precodeCREATE TABLE DOCTOR  DOCTORID CHAR9 NOT NULL,  DNUM INT NOT NULL,  NAME VARCHAR20 NOT NULL,  DOB DATE,  SPECIALTY VARCHAR20 NOT NULL,  SALARY INT,  CITY VARCHAR15,  STREET VARCHAR15,  STARTDATE DATE,  PRIMARY KEYDOCTORID  FOREIGN KEYDNUM REFERENCES DEPARTMENTDEPARTMENTNO codepre  pA doctor can be working in one or two departments. So, if I have a doctor working in department 1 and 4 the values for DNUM will include 1 and 4.p  pI initially chose the data type of DNUM to be INTsame as DEPARTMENTNO data type. But INT is not ideal for multiple values.p  pWhat should the data type be or what other solution i have if,for example, I run a query for returning the name of the doctors working in department 4. The query should return all the names of doctors working in department 4only and the ones who work in multiple departmentsincluding 4.p  pThanks very much in advance and sorry for the long message.p
Negative 14158 pOk, so I am working on a test site while learning Laravel 4.  This is my first MVC framework of any kind so Im taking it slow.p  pIve already implemented several features including  Users via Sentry, Profile Users updating their own information, and all of that works fine.p  pNow, I am working on a system that allows users to request a quote for services.  I felt like I understood the basic concepts behind forms and handling input, but apparently not.  I was able to get the validation and everything out of the way, and all of that works.  But now, when I go to actually execute the action once the form data is validated, I am constantly given a blank page.  Ive tried pretty much everything.p  pHere is my QuoteControllerp  precodepublic function create              user  SentrygetUser         ifissetstatusMessage statusMessage           ifissetallErrors allErrors           return Viewmakequote.creategtwitharrayuser gt SentrygetUser, statusMessage gt statusMessage, allErrors gt allErrors      public function createDo              user  SentrygetUser         input  Inputall         rules  arrayquotetype gt requiredinweb,design,other, budget gt requiredin1000,2000,5000,10000,20000,99999, siteslike gt max5000, sitesdislike gt max5000, content gt requiredmax50000         filesrules  arrayfile gt mimesjpeg,png,pdf,doc,txt,bmp,gifmax500         validator  Validatormakeinput, rules  ifvalidatorgtfails                      allErrors  validatorgterrors                   ifInputhasFilefiles                      files  Inputfilefiles              if isarrayfiles                              files  arrayfiles                           foreachfiles as file                              if isafile, SymfonyComponentHttpFoundationFileUploadedFile                      continue                                   fileValidator  Validatormakearrayfile gt file, filesrules                  iffileValidatorgtfails                                      messages  fileValidatorgtmessagesgttoArray                     foreachmessages[file] as message                                              allErrorsgtaddfile, message                                                                      ifallErrorsgtany                      Inputflash             return RedirectroutequotecreategtwithErrorsallErrorsgtwithInput                  else                          Quotecreatearray                     status gt 1,                     publicid gt strtouppersubstrmd5rand100000000,3888888888.time, 0, 10..substrmd5rand100000000,3888888888.timea week ago, 0, 10,                     customer gt intvalusergtid,                     quotetype gt input[quotetype],                     siteslike gt input[siteslike],                     sitesdislike gt input[sitesdislike],                     budget gt intvalinput[budget],                     content gt input[content]              return Redirectroutequote               codepre  pAnd heres the routesp  precode Quote Routegetquote, arraybefore gt authquote, uses gt QuoteControllerindex, as gt quote Routepostquotecreate, arrayuses gt QuoteControllercreateDo, as gt quotecreateDo Routegetquotecreate, arraybefore gt auth, uses gt QuoteControllercreate, as gt quotecreate    Staff Routegetstaff, arraybefore gt auth.staff, uses gt StaffControllerindex, as gt staffindex    Sandbox Routegetsandbox, arraybefore gt permissionuser.create, function      return You have access  codepre  pAnd finally, the quote.create view.p  precode errors   statusMessage  ltbrgtltbrgt  Formopenarrayroute gt quotecreateDo, files gt true  ltbrgtltbrgt ltlabel forquotetypegtltspangtType of Quoteltspangtltlabelgt  Formselectquotetype, arrayweb gt Web, design gt Design, other gt Other  ltbrgtltbrgt ltlabel forbudgetgtltspangtProject Budgetltspangtltlabelgt  Formselectbudget, array1000 gt Up to 1,000, 2000 gt 1,000  2,000, 5000 gt 2,000  5,000, 10000 gt 5,000  10,000, 20000 gt 10,000  20,000, 99999 gt Over 20,000  ltbrgtltbrgt ltlabel forsiteslikegtltspangtThree designs you likeltspangtList three websites or designs that you like, and why  in regards to design, formatting, graphics, anything.

Negative 14158 pI noticed some inconsistencies between the data retrieved via the Youtube API v3 and what Youtube shows accessing directly the website. Sometimes, the data returned via the playlistitem list contains a lower number of items videos than the playlist shown in the website. This happens when the playlist contains deleted videos. In fact, at times, a video marked as deleted on youtubes playlist, it is still reported in the returned data of a playlistitems call, other times it is not, leading to a playlist having 2 different sizes i.e. 20 videos on the website and only 18 returned via the api.p  pThis is puzzling for my users when they compare the playlists on youtube and in my application, as they see 2 different results...p  pAnyone knows how to handle playlists with deleted videos Or how to retrieve the same data as it is shown in the websitep  pIm using php and youtube v3 apis and youtubes php libraries if it is relevant.p

I am inexperienced with all topics concerened, but I am almost certain it is not a DBI or perl issue because of the fact the same script with the same connection parameters works in cron.

I am not sure how I would confirm this though nor do I know where to start to figure out what else could be causing this. p  pI am happy to provide any more details needed. Thank You for your help. p

Negative 14158 pI have database cleaning job that uses Entity Framework 5. There are quite some business rules to determine if an Entity should be deleted from the database or not, also if one parent Entity should be deleted various related Entities should also be deleted. The job first creates a DbContext on which all other queries and .RemovesomeObj operations are performed against. Every time a parent and all its related entities are have been marked for deletion using .Remove I call .SaveChanges. I have set db.Configuration.AutoDetectChangesEnabled  falsep  pI notice performance slows considerably over time.p  pFor example, in a database with 5000 entities where 500 should be deleted, the execution time is approx 130. Whereas should I modify the rules so that 1000 are to be deleted the execution time goes up to 7 minutes p  pI tried to pay attention not to load more data than necessary into the context and minimize the number of queries that gets executed to the database. Still, the first 100 is much, much faster to remove than the last 100 in the same job. p  pWhy Total memory usage and the number of performed queries to the database seems reasonable. p  pSpliting the work into smaller chunks of for example 100, and create a new DbContext for each chunk, seem not to help. p  pIs there any other thing I might consider Could it be database or index relatedp  pThe

Negative 14158 pIve looked around and havent seen this question answered before, so please forgive me if Im mistaken.p  pWhat I have is a text string given by a user that can basically be anything. I split the string by newline characters, codencode, so I differentiate between ideas in the text. I want to put each idea into a codeltspangtcode, and have each span be spaced from the left side of the screen using codeleft numberof pxcode. The problem I am running into is that I want the spacing to be dependent on the number of underscores starting out each idea. So if one idea is codeBlah blahcode, the css should be codeleft 5pxcode, and if the idea is codeBlah blahcode, the css should be codeleft 10pxcode.p  pRight now my code picks out the number of underscores at the beginning of each idea and creates a className in the span that the idea will be put into.p  pI know this is doable by having lots of css properties like thisp  precode.lvl11      left 0px  .lvl12      left 5px  .lvl13      left 10px  ... and so on codepre  pBut because the text is unknown, and there may be infinite levels and sublevels, I would appreciate it if I could have some css field or something that will autoincrement the left property depending on the className. Is this possible Thanks for any helpp  pHeres a demo that may be useful a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netq24G7 relnofollowFiddleap

FB.login      else         In this case, the person is not logged into Facebook, so we call the login         function to prompt them to do so. Note that at this stage there is no indication        of whether they are logged into the app. If they arent then theyll see the Login        dialog right after they log in to Facebook.

Negative 14158 pwe have developped application based on Karaf and Apache Camel. While our application is entirely based on bundles  OSGI  we are also loading the Camel context  and its Route Contexts  on startup, whcih would mean that we have defined some static routes. p  pMy question is. Is there a way to dynamically LOAD routes while the application is running without the need to reread the Camel Context as this will resetrestart the already existing routes. The same would apply to already created routes, for example if we want to edit a route whcih already exist. p  pThe whole idea is that we are planning to put the routes in a database and as such, the database will be edited by a GUI. p  pSo whats the best approach to do this I do not beleive that it is really the best approach to reload OSGI bundlebundles in case of a route being added, editted etc... p  pMore or less during operation of the application, Different endpoints  their related routes will be added, edited, removed. p  pPlease advise. p  pThanks,  Tihop

Negative 14158 pWhile working on a legacy projectr I came across the following pattern  a POD struct is used to transfer data over the network. p  precodestruct PODType       some data     int data  codepre  pOn the receiver side, the data is received into an object of the POD type. Later on, a class is derived from the PODType and the received object is casted with a Cstyle cast into the derived class to use some methods accessing the data.p  precodeclass DerivedFromPOD public PODType  public      some methods     int fint x return datax protected      some methods   PODType pod receiveamppod  DerivedFromPOD d  DerivedFromPODamppod int i  dgtf10 codepre  pThe derived class has public and protected methods, so it is not a POD anymore. I know that this is an abuse of inheritance, but it has been in the code base for a long time.p  pI am wondering if that is guaranteed to work from a standard point of view C03 or C98. The derived class does not have any own data members or virtual functions, but I am not sure if it guaranteed that the memory layout is identical given that one is POD and the other is not. Is the compiler forced to arrange DerivedFromPOD such that coded.datacodes address is identical to the address of an object d of DerivedFromPOD type, as it is for the POD baseclass p
Negative 14158 pIts about an Cordova application. On start I request a codejson php filecode, which contains several codeDatetimecode strings, which were pulled from my DB.

For example I have this datetime in my DBp  precode20140522 194500 codepre  pIn my application this date represents the start of an event. The user can now enable notifications. Which works fine when I test it.p  pBut what about someone in an other timezone e.g. Brazil, GMT3, so it should be 20140522 strong14strong4500.

Would that do the trickp  pThank you for taking the time to read this. I appreciate every answer.p

Negative 14158 pIm playing around with lighting a cube. Im not really sure what I want yet so Im just throwing this out there. This is what Ive got...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoQwIO.png altp  p...but I dont like the sharp edges. Removing the lighting obviously means you cant see the edges any more....p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.coma72og.png altp  p...which is no good as you still need to be able to identify the faces of the cube.p  pI guess Im looking for some kind of lighting that smoothly transitions between the faces, doesnt look too harsh yet still enables you to identify the object as a cube. Tessellating the edges is not really an option at the moment. Anyone done anything similarp  pUPDATE Alas my comment reply to Jherico was too long so adding an update here instead.p  pI dont really have a shader at the moment as Ive just started on this. I was playing around in photoshop to see what blurring the edge would look like or adding a thin highlight to somehow extenuate it. I guess what Im really looking for is just to get away from the harsh edge look.p  pI was researching if there were any tricks from the film industry or even what techniques high quality renders use to soften edges. Or maybe look at using something like rim lighting to take your focus away from the sharp angles. I would image tessellation could help a lot but ideally Id like a cheaper technique that could be used on lower spec hardware. p

Negative 14158 pI am trying to read in a file that goes a little something like this...p  precode52 12 123 1 4 2 11  9 88 1 23 42 codepre  pAnd the file goes on with each line changing I know how to read in each number individually using a loop with fscanf, but I want to read the first number to be the parent in a tree and the rest of the line be its children.  So this would make 3 trees with 52, 4, and 9 being parents.  How should I go about reading the rest of the line and add each int to the proper tree I am coding this in c.p
Negative 14158 pI would like to make a codeTextViewcode that can change the size of its text based on pinch zooming. The codeTextViewcode is inside a codeScrollViewcode. Ive got the codeTextViewcode to zoom when pinching BUT only when you move your fingers almost perfectly horizontally. If there is a vertical component to the pinchzoom it defaults to scrolling instead of zoomingp  pIs there a way to disable the scrolling of the codeScrollViewcode when there is more than 1 pointer on it then reenable scrolling when the pointer count returns to 1 or 0 Is the best way to create a codeCustomScrollViewcode widget or is there an easier wayp
Negative 14158 pIn MySQL, I cannot reuse a table in a predicate, if I am executing a codeDELETEcode or codeUPDATEcode on the same table. For instance, this is not possiblep  precodeDELETE FROM storycategory WHERE categoryid NOT IN             deleting from this table...  SELECT DISTINCT category.id FROM category         INNER JOIN storycategory ON categoryidcategory.id                  ... prevents using the same table in predicates codepre  pThe above example was taken from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq45494521799this Stack Overflow questiona, where the accepted answer and many other answers point out that there is a trick you can use by nesting the subquery into another subquery to trick MySQL into not recognising the table reusep  precodeDELETE FROM storycategory            WHERE categoryid NOT IN      SELECT cid FROM          SELECT DISTINCT category.id AS cid FROM category          INNER JOIN storycategory ON categoryidcategory.id                   apparently no longer considered the same table      AS c  codepre  pNow, this workaround and the fact that it is even possible raise two big questionsp  ul liThe error checking is obviously not well implemented. A simple query transformation, and MySQL no longer recognises a situation that it tries to forbid for hopefully a good reason.li liBecause there emprobably isem a good reason, it emprobably isntem a good idea to work around this limitation.li ul  pI suspect that the reason for preventing such access in predicates is related to some guarantees that MySQL tries to establish with respect to ACIDness. Im afraid that if working around this limitation, I might corrupt my data or generate funny race conditions in edgecases.p  pUnfortunately, a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.7enupdate.html relnofollowthe MySQL manuala is not very explicit with respect to the rationale of this errorp  blockquote   pCurrently, you cannot update a table and select from the same table in a subquery.p blockquote  h3So, my question ish3  pWhat are the reasons why MySQL disallows this very common idiom where the table from an codeUPDATEcode or codeDELETEcode statement must not be referenced in any predicatesp

However, I am doing this at school and the modules I would like to use Pygame or Pyglet cannot be downloaded just for me to make a game that has no real purpose. If I could use something other than tkinter I probably would. Thank you for your help. p

Negative 14158 pIve been working on an web wrapper app. I use webview to load some webpage, which needs user login. In order to control login process to get automatic login, I created a login page locally and login process works fine. The login page will store user login info locally so that next time when user opens the app, login page will be skipped and logged in webpage will be displayed. p  pHowever, Ive met problems for logout. How could user return to the local login page What Im thinking is to create a logout bar above webview, with a logout button there.Are there any better ways p  pWhats even worse, there is also a logout button on the webpage and that button will lead user to the online login page, which is not able to store login info locally since it seems there is no way to retrieve HTML text field info on webview and pass the info to Java Or Ill have no need to have local login page any more. Is there a way to avoid thisp  pThanksp

Negative 14158 pIm using AngularSelect2 and what I need is actually on change collect some more values than just what currently chosen options have as their names. For example, if options codeRedcode, codeBluecode, codeYellowcode are selected, the current value is array of those values. What I want to do is to have displayed below the select box all those in this example colors that are chosen. It works so far  colors are showing and as I remove one from the select box as tags, by clicking X sign the bottom updates accordingly.p  pWhat I need to further accomplish is to send along other values, or at least one id so I can query my database. I know, I could include it before the actual name and then remove in my list to be able to manipulate it separately but then the id is also shown in the dropdown list and within selected options.p  pHow to proceed Is there anything that may be attached to options and sent and readable within the below area in which textual selected options text is shown.p  pIm wathching for changes like thisp  precodescope.watchselectDiseaseState, functionnewVal     scope.listDiagnosis  newVal  codepre  pEDIT If confused  this is multiselect dropdown.

Negative 14158 pI am just learning about pipes, fifo and I have a question.p  pWhat happen if one program opens a pipe for reading and another program opens a pipe for writing. The two programs run in paralel. Lets say that the first program tries to read form pipe, but there is no information so its block until the second program writes something.p  pIn the second step, the first program is faster, and tries to read again form pipe. This time there is some information from the last time. What does the program do Does it read the information from the last time p  pThanksp

Negative 14158 pI finally found a hrefhttpprativas.wordpress.comcategoryandroiduploadingimagefromandroidapptoserverprogrammatically relnofollowan examplea  to upload both file and text data from Android to the server. It works only with additional libraries. My first question is how to parse received data on the server side I could not find the format of the data. I use Ansi C cgibin program.p  pI see that uploaddownload to the server from Android is a problem. Ive already  spent two days. I tried many examples.  I tried a hrefhttpwww.elvenware.comcharliedevelopmentandroidSimpleHttpGetThread.html relnofollowthis examplea. But it does  not uploaddownload files more than about 4k. There are couple a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4126625howtosendafileinandroidfrommobiletoserverusinghttpexamples herea They can upload file, but I cant find a way to send  file name with the file body. Sending only file data without what it is information looks awful.p  pAnd my second question is as follows what is the best way to send files to the server with some text data Preferably without extra libraries. Thanksp
Negative 14158 pemI am being more thorough with hope the question will actually be easier to understand.emp  pstrongActivity purposestrong allow users to select images from gallery display thumbnail of image in ListFragment along with title user gave the image when user is finished save each images uri and title, and the name user gave this collection of images.p  pstrongProblemstrong When device is rotated the FragmentList is losing all the images and titles the user already chose, ie, all the rows of the list are missing.p  pstrongAttempted problem solvingstrongp  ul lipImplemented the RetainedFragment to save the List collection on device rotation. Previously I had not done this and figured Ah, the adapter is fed a blank List collection on creation. Ill save the state of the List and then when Activitys onCreate is called I can feed the retained List to the Adapter constructor and itll work. But it didnt.pli lipThen I thought, Of course it is not working, you havent notified the adapter of the change So I put the codeadapter.notifyDataSetChangedcode in the onCreate. This didnt work.pli lipThen I moved the codeadapter.notifyDataSetChangedcode to codeonStartcode thinking I might need to notify the adapter later in the activitys lifecycle. Didnt work.pli ul  pNote I have another activity in this same app that use this same custom ListViewFragment and the state of the ListFragment is being preserved with device orientation changes. That activity has two principle differences the fragment is hard coded into the .xml I dont think that would make a difference, other than perhaps maybe Androids native saving of .xml fragments is different than programmatically added ones and that activity uses a Loader and LoaderManager and gets its data from a Provider that I built which gathers data from my SQLite database. Looking at the differences between these two activities is what caused me to think youre not handling the data feeding the adapter appropriately somehow and inspired me to use the RetainedFragment to save the List collection when the device is rotated.p  p...which is prompting me to think about figuring out how to, as Android says on their Loader page about LoaderManagerp  blockquote   pAn abstract class associated with an Activity or Fragment for managing one or more Loader instances. This helps an application manage longerrunning operations in conjunction with the Activity or Fragment lifecycle the most common use of this is with a CursorLoader, however applications are free to write their own loaders for loading other types of data. p blockquote  pIt is the loading other types of data part that has me thinking Could I use a LoaderManager to load the List data Two reasons I shy from this 1 what I have already, at least conceptually, ought to work 2 what Im doing currently isnt really a longerrunning operation at all, I dont think.p  pstrongResearchstrongp  ul lipa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13305861foolproofwaytohandlefragmentonorientationchange1330663313306633StackOverflow Fool proof way to handle Fragment on orientation changeap  ul lisave state of a fragment. li liI think the RetainedFragment I am using saves what needs to be saved.li ulli lipa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15313598onceforallhowtocorrectlysaveinstancestateoffragmentsinbackstack1713534617135346Once for all, how to correctly save instance state of Fragments in back stackap  ul lipSave backstack fragments. pli lipNot shown in my code pasted below, but my activity dynamically creates three other fragments and I use the following if codesavedInstanceState nullcode and those fragments states are saved without doing any work in codeonSaveInstanceStatecode this is partly why it feels like my problem isnt with doing something in codeonSaveInstanceStatecode because Android handles the saving my other fragments state so shouldnt it do it, too, with the ListFragment Seems like it should.p  precodeifsavedInstanceState.containsKeyAddActivityFrag1.F1TAG     frag1  AddActivityFrag1getFragmentManager.getFragmentsavedInstanceState, AddActivityFrag1.F1TAG  codepreli ulli lipa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11182180understandingfragmentssetretaininstancebooleanUnderstanding Fragment39s setRetainInstancebooleanapli lipMany of the StackOverflow questions surrounding my query seem to be mostly about how to save the scroll position of the ListFragment with orientation change but I dont need to do that though I did read them looking for tips that might help. pli lipa hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidecomponentsfragments.html relnofollowAndroid Fragmentsapli lia hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidecomponentsloaders.html relnofollowAndroid Loadersali lia hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingdisplayingbitmapscachebitmap.html relnofollowAndroid Caching Bitmaps RetainFragment stuffali ul  pActivity  with many, hopefully unrelated things, removedp  precodepublic class AddActivity extends Activity       data collection     ListltImageBeangt beanList       adapter     AddCollectionAdapter adapter       ListViewFragment tag     private static final String LVFTAG  list fragment tag       fragment handles     ListViewFragment listFrag       Handles images LruCache for bitmapes     ImageHandler imageHandler      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activityadd2           Create ImageHandler that holds LruCache         imageHandler  new ImageHandlerthis, getFragmentManager                   Obtain retained ListltImageBeangt or create new ListltImageBeangt.

Negative 14158 pI would want to have different environments in AWS. At first I thought of differentiating environments by Tags, tags on of AWS Resources. But then I cannot restrict users to change Tags of the machine. What that means is, if I allow them codeec2CreateTagscode, they can not only create tag, but also change tag of any of the resource, since cannot apply a condition on it  say for example if it belongs to a particular VPC or subnet. If I dont allow them the previlege to create tag, then they can launch an instance but they tags are not applied and hence any further operation on instance is not permitted.p  pIf I want to distinguish between environments by VPCID, then for operations such as codeec2StartInstancecode cannot apply a condition to allow the operation only in specific VPCID, but can conditionally allow based on Resource Tag which for reasons in previous paragraph is not convincing.p  pOn AWS a hrefhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comAWSToolkitEclipselatestGettingStartedGuidedifferentiateresourceswithnaming.html relnofollowdocumentation a it mentionsp  blockquote   pOne approach to maintaining this separation was discussed in the a hrefhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comAWSToolkitEclipselatestGettingStartedGuidetkesetupcreds.html relnofollowWorking with AWS Access Credentialsa, that is, to use different accounts for development and production resources.p blockquote  pSo it is possible to have one Paying Account for several other accounts which themselves are Paying Accounts  I still dont think multiple accounts for just different environments is a good idea.p  pHow do you generally differentiate among environments for enforcing policiesp  pThanks.p

Depending on the codesProcessColorModelcode value DEVICERGB a correct value is printed out.p  pThe conversion works for all files. But when I validate the created PDF file against PDFA1b, I get different results depending whether the input file has RGB color space or not e.g. CMYK. So, when I have an input PDF file which uses CMYK color space, the file gets converted by the script, but the validator says something like thisp  precodeinput.pdf, 1, 38, 0x03418614, A devicespecific color space DeviceCMYK without an appropriate output intent is used., 1 output.pdf, 20, 0, 0x83410612, The document does not conform to the requested standard., 1 codepre  pMy question Is there a way to get the conversion done for arbitrary files i.e. independent of the used color space in the input file p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pKenS Thanks for your answer. Ive updated my initial post to clarify what I want to achieve.p  pTo make it more explicit, I will use an example. There are two files codeinput1.pdfcode seems to use RGB and codeinput2.pdfcode seems to use CMYK. I want to convert both of them to PDFA1. Thanks to your hint, Ive let go of the above mentioned batch script and instead tested the command directly in the command line. After reading a hrefhttpgit.ghostscript.compghostpdl.gitablobplainfgsdocPs2pdf.htmhbHEADPDFA relnofollowPs2pdf.htmPDFAa, I have adjusted the official emPDFAdef.psem so that emAdobeRGB1998.iccem is used. Then I invoked the following command on both input files replaced emoutput1.pdfem by emoutput2.pdfem and eminput1.pdfem by eminput2.pdfem for the second filep  precodegswin64c.exe dPDFA1 dBATCH dNOPAUSE dNOOUTERSAVE               sColorConversionStrategyRGB               sOutputICCProfileAdobeRGB1998.icc sDEVICEpdfwrite               sOutputFileoutput1.pdf dPDFACompatibilityPolicy1                PATHTOOFFICIALPDFAdef.ps input1.pdf codepre  pThe conversion was done without any errors. The output1.pdf seems to be valid, but the output2.pdf is still invalid tested with 3heights Validatorp  precodeoutput2.pdf, 1, 40, 0x03418614, A devicespecific color space DeviceCMYK without an appropriate output intent is used., 1 output2.pdf, 20, 0, 0x83410612, The document does not conform to the requested standard., 1 codepre  pSo when I understand your answer correctly, the above command should produce a pdf file which uses the RGB color space  independent of the color space of the input file. If the input file uses CMYK, than the colors have to be translated into RGB with the above command.p  pWhen I interpret the first error message correctly, the used color space in the output2.pdf is still CMYK although the command parameters like ColorConversionStrategyRGB. Since I used AdobeRGB1998.icc, the validation error appears.p  pWhat am I missing in the above commandp  pGoing back to my original question which is one step further Instead of always converting to RGB or CMYK, I wanted to somehow detect which color space is used in the input file and then dynamically switch to a RGB or CMYK icc file. Is it possible to achieve thatp

Negative 14158 pIm working on a random walk simulation of particles moving in a lattice. For that reason I must create a massive amount of random numbers, about 1012 and above. Currently Im using the possibilities C11 provides with codeltrandomgtcode. When profiling my program, I see that a major amount of time is spent in codeltrandomgtcode. The vast majority of those numbers are between 0 and 1, evenly distributed. Here a then I need a number from a binomial distribution. But the focus lies on the 0..1 numbers.p  pThe question is What can I do to reduce the CPU time needed to generate these numbers and what would the impact be on their qualityp  pAs you can see, I tried different engines, but that had no big effect on CPU time. Further, what is the difference between my codeuniform01gencode and codegeneratecanonicalltdouble,numericlimitsltdoublegtdigitsgtgencode anyhowp  pstrongEditstrong Reading through the answers I conclude that there is not THE ideal solution for my problem. Thus I decided to first make my program multi threading capable and run multiple RNG in different threads seeded with one randomdevice number  an thread individual increment. For the time being this seams to be the most unavoidable step multi threading would be required anyhow. As a further step, pending on exact requirements I consider switching to the suggested Intel RNG or to Thrust. Meaning that my RNG implementation should not be to complex, which, currently is is not. But for now I like to focus on the physical correctness of my model and not on programming stuff, this comes as soon as the output of my program is physically correct. a hrefhttpthrust.github.io relnofollowThrusta a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10484164whatisthelatencyandthroughputoftherdrandinstructiononivybridgeConcerning Intel RNGap  pHere is what I do currentlyp  precodeclass Generator  public     Generator     virtual Generator     double rand01 random number [0,1     int binomialint n, double p binomial distribution with n samples with probability p private     stdrandomdevice randev seed     Engines     stdmt1993764 gen     stdmt19937 gen     stddefaultrandomengine gen     Distributions     stduniformrealdistributionltdoublegt uniform01     stdbinomialdistributionltgt binomialdist   GeneratorGenerator  randev, genrandev, uniform010.,1., binomial1,1.

Negative 14158 pIm currently working on a small project which requires loading messages from a file. The messages are stored sequentially in the file and files can become huge, so loading the entire file content into memory is unrewarding.p  pTherefore we decided to implement a codeFileReadercode class that is capable of moving to specific elements in  the file quickly and load them on request. Commonly used something along the following linesp  precodeSpecificMessage m FileReader fr fr.openfile.bin fr.moveTo120  Move to Message 120 fr.readampm     Try deserializing as SpecificMessage  codepre  pThe FileReader per se works great. Therefore we thought about adding STL compliant iterator support as well A random access iterator that provides readonly references to specific messages. Used in the following wayp  precodefor auto iter  fr.beginltSpecificMessagegt iter  fr.endltSpecificMessagegt iter     ...  codepre  pRemark the above assumes that the file only contains messages of type SpecificMessage. Weve been using codeboostiteratorfacadecode to simplify the implementation.p  pNow my strongquestionstrong boils down to how to implement the iterator correctly Since codeFileReadercode does not actually hold a sequence of messages internally, but loads them on request. p  pWhat weve tried so farp  pstrongStoring the message as an iterator memberstrongp  pThis approach stores the message in the iterator instance. Which works great for simple usecases but fails for more complex uses. E.g. codestdreverseiteratorcode has a dereference operation that looks like thisp  precode reference operator const     return designated value    RanIt Tmp  current    return Tmp   codepre  pThis breaks our approach as a reference to a message from a temporary iterator is returned.p  pstrongMaking the reference type equal the value typestrongp  pDDrmmr in the comments suggested making the reference type equal the value type, so that a copy of the internally stored object is returned. However, I think this is not valid for the reverse iterator which implements the  operator asp  precodepointer operatorgt const    return ampthis  codepre  pwhich derefs itself, calls the operator which then returns a copy of a temporary and finally returns the address of this temporary.p  pstrongStoring the message externallystrongp  pAlternatively I though about storing the message externallyp  precodeSpecificMessage m auto iter  fr.beginltSpecificMessagegtampm  ... codepre  pwhich also seems to be flawed for p  precodeauto iter2  iter  2 codepre  pwhich will have both codeiter2code and codeitercode point to the same content.p

Negative 14158 pI am struggling trying to relate two string lists they are called List A and Pairs. My aim is to calculate a determinant formed by the points in list A referenced in the list Pairs.p  pThe lists look like thisp  pstrongListA stringstrongp  precode[0] 30 10 0, These represent the coordinates x,y,z of a point [1] 50 10 0, [2] 40 10 0, [3] 10 10 0, [4] 20 10 0, [5] 60 10 0, [6] 70 20 0, [7] 75 15 0, [8] 100 10 0, [9] 80 10 0, codepre  pstrongList Pairs stringstrongp  precode[0] 5 4  This indicates that the segment is formed by the points 5 and 4 in the List A [1] 0 1 [2] 6 7 [3] 6 5 [4] 9 6 [5] 2 3 [6] 8 9 codepre  pHowever, I need to follow a particular logic doing this because I need to populate two lists depending on the value of the determinant. They are called strongSegmentCollstrong and strongPointsCollstrong. See the explanation of this and an illustrative example belowp  pEXPLANATIONp  precodeGiven two generic segments ab and cd stored in INT list pairs and ax,ay,az,bx,by,bz,cx,cy,cz,dx,dy,dz coordinates of such points  stored in INT list A the following conditions must be checked  DETa,b,c 0 DETa,b,d 0  I have to compare each of the segments with the other ones and if both determinants are  0 then I add the segments indices to a list called segmentColl and the points in List A that are referred by such indices in a list called pointsColl.     Example  i Compare segment0 which is 5,4 in the pairs list against segment1 which is 0 1      DET[5,4,0]DET[60 10 0], [20 10 0], [30, 10, 0]  0   See the formula of the determinant in the struct Point     DET5,4,1 DET[60 10 0], [20 10 0] , [50, 10, 0] 0      Both determinants are  0 so      1 I add the segment 0 1 to the FIRST row in INT LIST called segmentColl          SegmentColl [0,1],[ , ],[ , ],[ , ]       2 I add the points represented by these indices [20 20 0] [40 20 0] to the FIRST row in INT LIST called pointsColl.          PointsColl [20 20 0] [40 20 0] , [...] [...] , [...] [...] , [...] [...]   ii Compare segment 0 against segment 2 doing DET5,4,6 and DET5,4,7. In this case     the determinants 0 so they are not added to the FIRST row of segmentColl and pointsColl.       We keep on doing this for segment0 against segment3, then segment0 against segment4 and so on.  iii Once segment0 have been compared against all the other segments we move onto the next segment 1 and we do the same as with       segment 0. This will populate the SECOND row of the lists segmentColl and pointsColl.       Note at this point we will also compare segment1 with segment0 again because I want it to be in the SECOND row of the lists if       the determinant is zero which is the case.   We will repeat this process so each segment has been compared with ALL the others.    The expected result is  SegmentColl  [0,1],[2,3],[5,4],[8,9]  These four segments are collinear det0 [6,7],[9,6]  These two segments are collinear det0   PointsColl [20 20 0] [40 20 0] , [...] [...] , [...] [...] , [...] [...]   The points represented by the 4 segments in segmentColl row 0 [70 20 0] [75 15 0] , [...] [...]                   The points represented by the two segments in segmentColl row 1 codepre  pMy code is not very good but I think that the structs in there can be helpful, specially when it comes to calculate the determinant. p  precodeusing System     using System.Collections.Generic   This struct have been previously used to define the List pairs  struct Pair      public int X  get set  public int Y  get set  public Pairint x, int y       this      X  x     Y  y   public override string ToString      return String.Format0 1, this.X, this.Y     This struct has been previously used to define the points in List A and to provide a way to   calculate the determinants struct Point  public readonly int X public readonly int Y public readonly int Z  public Pointint x, int y, int z      X  x     Y  y     Z  z   public override string ToString      return String.Format0 1 2,, X, Y, Z   private static double DeterminantPoint a, Point b, Point c      return b.Y  a.Y  c.Z  a.Z  b.Z  a.Z  c.X  a.X  b.X  a.X  c.Y  a.Y  b.Z  a.Z  c.Y  a.Y  b.X  a.X  c.Z  a.Z  b.Y  a.Y  c.X  a.X   public static bool CollinearPoint a, Point b, Point c      return Determinanta, b, c  0.0   public static Point FromStringstring p      string[] items  p.Replace,, .Split      int[] coords  new int[3]     for int i  0 i lt 3 i coords[i]  int.Parseitems[i]     return new Pointcoords[0], coords[1], coords[2]      class Program  static void Main       region String Lists Input       This list represent the x,y,z coordinates of points.      var ListA  new Listltstringgt     ListA.Add30 10 0,     ListA.Add50 10 0,     ListA.Add40 10 0,     ListA.Add10 10 0,     ListA.Add20 10 0,     ListA.Add60 10 0,     ListA.Add70 20 0,     ListA.Add75 15 0,     ListA.Add100 10 0,     ListA.Add80 10 0,       This list have information about the connectivity of the points indexes in List A forming the edges.

I just want to keep information about edges for specific vertex.p  pFirst idea was that assume some vertex has assigned value 41. In binary representation it is 101001. That means this vertex is connected with vertices numer 1, 4 and 6. Then getting info about neighbors was simply tab[i] amp 1 ltlt j, where tab is 1d array of vertices and for vertex i it stores for example 41. j is a number of checking vertex.

Negative 14158 pI want to develop a kind of data logger using Laravel 4.2. There are different kind of sensors in the system with different data formats, for example a temperature sensor TemperatureSensor1 with only temperature data and an energy monitor EnergyMonitor1 with energy AND power data two data columns that belong together.p  pAn external app running on the server collects these data and shall post them to the Laravel application using HTTP POST and a route like this sensorsTemperatureSensor1data. The body of this HTTP POST consists of a JSON request, for a temperature sensor this would be temperature 12.3 or in case of the energy monitor this would be energy 10000.3, power 123.3. The Laravel application should store every dataset of every sensor in a MySQL database. I thought about having one table per sensor for storing the data points. In this examplep  precodeTable TemperatureSensor1  id  timestamp  temperature 1   123        12.3 ...  Table EnergyMonitor1  id  timestamp  energy   power 1   128        10000.3  123.3 ... codepre  pThere is also a table called sensors which looks like thisp  precodeid  sensorname         alias        datatype 1   TemperatureSensor1  Living room  0 2   EnergyMonitor1      House        1 codepre  pSo the logical path should bep  ol liSensor data collected by external app.li liHTTP POST to Laravel app sensorsSensornamedata with sensor specific JSON data.li liLaravel app looks in table sensors if it exists. Depending on the field datatype the JSON data is forwarded to a concrete model, for e.g. datatype0  TemperatureSensorModel or datatype1  EnergyMonitorModel. Note There can be a lot of temperature sensors in the system. All of them have different names and different tables with stored data, but have the TemperatureSensorModel in common.li liThe concrete model decodes the data and stores them in the sensorspecific table.li ol  pStep 3 is somewhat unclear to me at the moment. How would I do this in Laravel This kind of smells like a polymorphic relation different behaviour depending on the datatype but I dont think that the examples fit.p  pIs there maybe anotherbetter strategy to implement this kind of applicationp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pTo be more clear what I want to do with the datap  pBy calling sensorsSensornamedataview or something like this, a View should be rendered which should contain a plot of the collected data. Note that for every sensor type, a different view exists because a temperature plot looks different from an energy plot.p  pThe view contains the reference to a JS plotting component which should get the plot data from the database. This could be done by AJAX request of sensorsSensornamedata which would yield the logged data of table Sensorname e.g. TemperatureSensor1 in a JSON format.p  pI experimented a bit and this is what I came withp  pI have a resource controller and a nested resource controller, like thisp  precodeRouteresourcesensors, SensorController Routeresourcesensors.data, SensorDataController ...  class SensorDataController extends BaseController       public function storeid          sensor  Sensorwheresensorid, idgtfirst         sensormodel  SensorModelFactoryfromSensorsensor           do something with sensormodel        class SensorModelFactory      public static function fromSensorsensor                  sensormodel  null              if sensor                                  switch sensorgtdatatype                                                  case TemperatureSensorDATATYPE                                     sensormodel  new TemperatureSensor                                           if sensormodel                             sensormodelgtsetTablesensorgtsensorid                           return sensormodel       codepre  pThis seems to do the job for now.

Negative 14158 pI have defined my own grammar using yacc.My language gives user a flexibility to supply a extra header explicitly while invoking compiler which will be applicable to each of file to be compiled using my compiler.p  pI can think of two solutions to work with this scenario.p  p1.Append header to each of the file and compile each of the file separately.This is not a good idea as it involves editing the given source files which is necessary to append at beginning of the file.p  p2.Use yywrap to iterate over the list of files to be compiled and process header every time we find a new file. This is not good as it involves repeated parsing of the same file.p  pWithout processing the header,files doesnt satisfy the grammar.p  pPlease share the thoughts ,how it can be done in a best way   p

I was expecting it to be an instance of codeErrorcode and hoping to be able to retrieve the exceptions codeerrorCodecode using codeerr.errorCodecode.p  pHow exactly are exceptions thrown from applets converted to JavaScript objects, and is it possible to get more detail than just the name of the exception classp

Negative 14158 pI have a python application communicating with Titan graph database backed by Cassandra.p  pPython App  Rexster Server  Titan Graph DB  Cassandra.p  pThe Rexster Server  Titan Graph DB  Cassandra is inside a single JVM.p  pMy python application runs on multiple Virtual machines.i.e Each virtual machine has an identical copy of my application. The idea is to make the application scalable. Now clearly for the initial implementation I am using a single instance of Rexster Server  Titan Graph DB  Cassandra. This means that the backend database is a single node. My applications running on different virtual machines talk to the same backend.p  pMy questions are as follows.p  p1 I want to make the backend database scalable as well. How can I do this p  p2 Do I need to use the same Rexster  Titan Graph DB and configure multiple cassandra nodesp  p3 Is Titan Graph DB the best option for this use case Or can I substitute Titan Graph DB with Neo4j and Rexster with Neo4jserver. whywhynotp
Negative 14158 pSay that I had a method that required me to loop through a data structure, then return a number stored in a particular index if it was equal to a given number. If two numbers in the data structure were equal, then it would return the number that came first.p  precodepublic static int methodint value, ListltIntegergt list     for Integer i list         if i  value             return i                codepre  pThis is a problematic solution, because the method may not necessarily return. I suppose you could create a variable to store a reference to the equivalent value and return that, so the compiler does not issue a error about the lack of a return statement, but that would be pointless code.p  pIs there a better way to do this Would you just return 0, or return null, in the case that you are returning an objectp

Negative 14158 pI am trying to solve this interview question.  p  blockquote   pAfter given clearly definition of UTF8 format. ex 1byte      0b0xxxxxxx 2 bytes.... Asked to write a function to validate whether   the input is valid UTF8. Input will be stringbyte array, output   should be yesno.p blockquote  pI have two possible approaches. p  pFirst, if the input is a string, since UTF8 is at most 4 byte, after we remove the first two characters 0b, we can use Integer.parseInts to check if the rest of the string is at the range 0 to 10FFFF. Moreover, it is better to check if the length of the string is a multiple of 8 and if the input string contains all 0s and 1s first. So I will have to go through the string twice and the complexity will be On. p  pSecond, if the input is a byte array we can also use this method if the input is a string, we check if each 1byte element is in the correct range. If the input is a string, first check the length of the string is a multiple of 8 then check each 8character substring is in the range. p  pI know there are couple solutions on how to check a string using Java libraries, but my question is how I should implement the function based on the question. p  pThanks a lot. p

Negative 14158 pI have a WPF application Ive been working on for about a month at work, but because of licensing issues I have to convert it back to vs2010 from a vs2013 project. Im none too thrilled, but what can you do. I can only find material on upgrading from 2010 to 2013, not downgrading which makes perfect sense.p  pUnfortunately but understandably, you cant open vs2013 projects in 2010, so Im starting a new WPF project in 2010, and adding files in.p  pOne of the things Ive noticed is that 2010 doesnt seem to have codeApp.configcode, or codeApp.xamlcode and codeApp.xaml.cscode. I am using codeApp.configcode to store connection strings, and codeApp.Current.Propertiescode to store data from window to window in the application although that functionality doesnt seem to exist.p  pI do not know what to do to make this work. Is there a major difference in how one is supposed to program WPF from VS2010 to VS2013 I dont know to get around these issues. Im perfectly happy to rewrite code if I have to, but I dont know what the old way to do these things may have been.p

Negative 14158 pI had a look, and could not find any answers specific to my question, so I am making a new one.p  pSo I am currently searching for a solution to an issue which is formally out of my control, but would be great if there was something I could attempt to do to fix it anyway.p  pThe reason being is some of the classes being loaded are user provided and were not compiled correctly with the lowest compatible version of java, so it causes unpredictable java requirements. p  pOf course, this would only be done if necessary, but if it would have not loaded for that java version, attempt to patch the stamped java version so it would attempt it anyway.p  pBasically I am trying to correctif possible the stated compiled version stamped on java byte code, so that incompatible java version errors ideally are not thrown, even when they normally would, if the code could successfully be originally compiled on the lower java version in question.p  pBasically, other than the provided built in libraries which could be missing, I am not sure if the compilers have vastly different bytecode between different between versions. If this is the case, something like this could never work anyway.p  pAppreciate it, jdphenix, this is what I needed to know. p  pSorry for whatever i did wrong here to get negative votes.p
Negative 14158 pLets say we have a User, Wallet REST microservices and an API gateway that glues things together. When Bob registers on our website, our API gateway needs to create a user through the User microservice and a wallet through the Wallet microservice. p  pNow here are a few scenarios where things could go wrongp  ul lipUser Bob creation fails thats OK, we just return an error message to the Bob. Were using SQL transactions so no one ever saw Bob in the system. Everythings good pli lipUser Bob is created but before our Wallet can be created, our API gateway hard crashes. We now have a User with no wallet inconsistent data.pli lipUser Bob is created and as we are creating the Wallet, the HTTP connection drops. The wallet creation might have succeeded or it might have not.pli ul  pWhat solutions are available to prevent this kind of data inconsistency from happening Are there patterns that allow transactions to span multiple REST requests Ive read the Wikipedia page on a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTwophasecommitprotocol relnofollowTwophase commita which seems to touch on this issue but Im not sure how to apply it in practice. This a hrefhttpwsrest.org2014sitesdefaultfileswsrest2014submission7.pdf relnofollowAtomic Distributed Transactions a RESTful designa paper also seems interesting although I havent read it yet.p  pAlternatively, I know REST might just not be suited for this use case. Would perhaps the correct way to handle this situation to drop REST entirely and use a different communication protocol like a message queue system Or should I enforce consistency in my application code for example, by having a background job that detects inconsistencies and fixes them or by having a state attribute on my User model with creating, created values, etc.p

Negative 14158 pI have the following situation.  In my asp.net webforms projects, I have some shared repositories that I optionally use emunderem my main repositories.  The folders are named emSharedem and then emShared.em for others.  For example, I have a folder structure like this.p  precodemain   .. .git   .. mainsubfolder    .. Shared this should be ignored since own repo   .... .git   .... Sharedsubfolder   .... shared files    .. mainfiles codepre  pI think this pattern Im using might be similar to git submodules, but that is hopefully reserved for another discussion.p  pMy .gitignore file originally simply had codeSharedcode and everything worked great.p  pThen I discovered that in my asp mvc projects, my emViewsSharedem folders were getting ignored as expected given the above pattern.  So I tried to add an exclusion with codeViewsSharedcode but that didnt work in that git still didnt detect that for the mvc projects it should be adding emViewsSharedem content.p  pSo I ended up withp  precodeShared ViewsShared codepre  pAnd all seemed to work, however, I detected a problem in my original webforms projects that should be ignoring folders of emSharedem.  So the following image.  codegit statuscode appears to correctly be ignoring the Shared folder, but when I do a codegit add .code then codegit statuscode, you can see that it has been added.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxEfl3.png altgit add . workflowp  pNote codegit com am Commit Messagecode appears to work too.  If that would have been my original step instead of codegit add .code, the emSharedem folder is ignored on the commit.p  pIs my setup nested repository not supported or is my .gitignore pattern incorrect  Thanks in advance.p
Negative 14158 pIm looking to build a hash table where multiple String keys that share the same Byte array value are merged into one value with multiple keys.

Negative 14158 pI have a watch folder task that monitors a folder. when a file is dropped it runs an execute package task. I have a for loop to make this run all the time. Im having problems when 2 files are dropped before the execute package task is completed. There could even be 2 files coming in at once. I need to process both files.p  pIs there a way of doing this, maybe create a buffer to keep track of all files coming in the folderp  pThis is different from the other question suggested because the files are not already in the folder. They will get moved to the folder at random times, and multiple files can come in at once. What I understood from the other question suggested was that the files are already in the folder when the package is executed. that is not my case.p

When enabled,  the output class will test whether your server supports Gzip.  Even if it does, however, not all browsers support compression  so enable only if you are reasonably sure your visitors can handle it.   Only used if zlib.outputcompression is turned off in your php.ini.  Please do not use it together with httpdlevel output compression.   VERY IMPORTANT  If you are getting a blank page when compression is enabled it  means you are prematurely outputting something to your browser. It could  even be a line of whitespace at the end of one of your scripts.  For  compression to work, nothing can be sent before the output buffer is called  by the output class.  Do not echo any values with compression enabled.   config[compressoutput]  FALSE     Master Time Reference    Options are local or any PHP supported timezone. This preference tells  the system whether to use your servers local time as the master now  reference, or convert it to the configured one timezone.

Negative 14158 pI am trying to build a simple program to help me with a fantasy football draft. Ive set up a mock to predict picks based on a few things, but Im having an issue storing the right players to the right teams.p  pEDIT The problem seems to be that it is storing the pick to every team instead of just the one that I am iterating.

Negative 14158 pIm working on a security project and Im wondering how hard is it to read into the RAM memory of a computer. p  pFor example, I have a Java program that reads an image into ByteArrayInputStream, how hard would it be for someone to see this file if I immediately deleted the original file stored in disk The point of this is to make the file as secure as possible for the time of program being open. It doesnt matter if the file is lost forever after the program is interrupted.p  pPerhaps theres tools to look at these things Would it be different if I made my program in .NET perhaps easier or harder to do p  pIt was just a curious idea I got in my head. Thanks for the input.p

Negative 14158 pI am pricing my services and packages in an Excel workbook and have come to a place beyond my Excel knowledge. In a worksheet called Packages, I have columns for each different package I offer.  In the column I have dropdowns where one of any of my products can be selected I have 13 different products.p  pWhat I want to do is have a formula that in cell A25 looks at cells A9A21 and determines if there is any text, and then will take the cost corresponding the the product listed in said cell from the worksheet Product Pricing and will add all the values together. So, if A9 has product 1 and cost is 50, and A10 has Product 2 and cost is 75, and A11 is blank, I want the formula to make the value of A25 125 5075.p  pI feel like it should be a bunch of nested IF and ISBLANK formulas, but Ive only gotten part of the way through it and am being told Formula is too long.  Formulas may not exceed 8,192 characters.
