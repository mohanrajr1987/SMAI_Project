Positive 92541 pIm getting started with Polymer web components.  We have a product that can be injected into multiple client applications, or could even be a standalone application.

Usually you would want to use coresplitter along with flex layout so that the other sibling element can be flexible.Unfortunately this works for only Polymer 0.5 but this got deprecated in 1.0. Here is the demo in Polymer 0.5 version. a hrefhttpswww.polymerproject.org0.5componentscoresplitterdemo.html relnofollowDemo for coresplitter in Polymer 0.5ap  pI am able to do that in normal javascript but unable to make it work in Polymer 1.0.p  pHere is a a hrefhttpcodepen.ioharshakakumanupenMaJKNp relnofollowfiddleap  precodeltlink relimport       hrefhttpscdn.rawgit.comPolymerpolymermasterpolymer.htmlgt     ltdommodule idsplitterelementgt       lttemplategt         ltdiv iddiv1 classsplitgtBacon ipsum dolor amet beef ribs         meatloaf picanha pork loin pork chop rump pig sausage bacon shank boudin beef fatback.

Positive 92541 pI am trying to get better at coding and am trying to figure out exactly what front end stack I need. I have red a lot and about a lot of tools but it is too much and I dont know which ones work good together or not.p  pCurrently my idea is to do a web app with the design principles of Material Design from google and use angular for the logic of the front end.p  pI have red about and used these tools Angular.js, Material Design Lite, Angularmaterial, polymer, ionic, bootstrap, Materialize and other various material design frameworks.p  pI am playing with this demo that I wanted to try out Material Design Lite but went too further and ended up needing Polymer for some input dropdown components. Playing further more with MDL I found out that it is not sufficient as bootstrap as I am used to work and would like to have this in it, but dont get me wrong I like MDL.p  pionic has some good features for the local server and easy set up of template app as well other nice things like export to ios,android app, push notifications, but I ended up deleting ionic.css cause it was interfering with MDL and Polymerp  pI am asking some more experienced web app developers to help me out with this stack dilemma. I would like to get this out of my mind so I can be free and develop more.p  pAlso tools like GRUNT, BOWER and so on which one is the best in my case p  pnote if u got interested the back end would be cakePhP and Mysql and the data type is going to be JSON angular will send json to php into DB.p

Positive 92541 pIn my Polymer project, I have a codeltgooglemapgtcode with longitude and latitude value as properties. Underneath the map are two codeltpaperinputgtcode where the user can alternatively write the long and lat value for the map. When moving the cursor at the map, those two values update perfectly, however, when I write something in them, the map does not update.

Negative 92541 pOnce Ive called codeDragManager.acceptDragcode is there any way to unaccept the drag Say that I have a view which can accept drag and drop, but only in certain areas. Once the user drags over one of these areas I call codeDragManager.acceptDragthiscode from a codeDragEvent.DRAGOVERcode handler, but if the user then moves out of this area Id like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the codeDragManager.NONEcode feedback. However, neither calling codeDragManager.acceptDragnullcode nor codeDragManager.showFeedbackDragManager.NONEcode seems to have any effect. Once Ive accepted the drag an set the feedback type I cant seem to change it.p  pJust to make it clear the areas where the user should be able to drop are not components or even display objects, in fact they are just ranges in the text of a text field like the selection. Had they been components of their own I could have solved it by making each of them accept drag events individually. I guess I could create proxy components that float over the text to emulate it, but Id rather not if it isnt necessary.p  hr  pIve managed to get it working in both AIR and the browser now, but only by putting proxy components on top of the ranges of text where you should be able to drop things. That way I get the right feedback and drops are automatically unaccepted on drag exit.p  pThis is the oddest thing about DampD in AIRp  precodeDragManager.doDraginitiator, source, event, dragImage, offsetX, offsetY codepre  pIn browserbased Flex, codeoffsetXcode and codeoffsetYcode should be negative so says the documentation, and it works fine. However, when running emexactly the same codeem in AIR you have to make the offsets positive. The same numbers, but positive. That is very, very weird.p  hr  pIve tested some more and what a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10870howcaniunacceptadraginflex11209maclemaa works, but not if you run in AIR. It seems like drag and drop in AIR is different. Its really, really weird because not only is the feedback not showing correctly, and its not possible to unaccept, but the coordinates are also completely off. I just tried my application in a browser instead of AIR and dragging and dropping is completely broken.p  pAlso, skipping the codedragEntercode handler works fine in AIR, but breaks everything when running in a browser.p

Sometimes fixing it means just consuming a new method signature. But if an entire class is obsolete, and you have usage of it scattered through hundreds of thousands of lines of code, it could take weeks or more to fix.

For my case Im talking about Favouriting of an artist, counting the times an artists track has been played, displaying a count of how many playlists an artists track has been added to a playlist...

Secondly, since DML on CLUSTERED INDEX columns can be costly when they are not sequential on insertion I need to make this a scheduled job.p  pSo, for the artist favourite stats, heres the DDL that I have come up with.

Negative 92541 pIve been working on a Stored Procedure that checks the time, then retrieves records going back over the last full 24 hour period between 8am and the previous 8am.  So, for instance, assume that its currently 10am.  The stored procedure looks at the current time, notes that it is past 8am, and sets the query to run backwards 24 hours, from 8am today to 8a yesterday.  If it were, say, 7am, the query would be set to check from 8am yesterday to 8am the day before.  This was actually relatively simple to do.  The SP is meant to be used to retrieve records for a report tracking jobs completed in the given time span.p  pHowever, theyve come back at me and asked me to change the stored procedure such that the hour the report ends at, and the span of time checked, is configurable from the frontend of the site.

I tried to memory map some files , and I found that I am not able to map any more files when the Mapped usage comes close to the MemTotal  viewed via cat procmeminfo.p  blockquote   pFrom procmeminfo on the 64 bit linux box p      pMemTotal     32909628 kBp      pMemFree        221744 kBp      pBuffers          1800 kBp      pMapped       31642928 kBp      pCommitLimit  38012616 kBp      pCommittedAS 42641120 kBp      pVmallocTotal 536870911 kBp      pVmallocUsed    299920 kBp      pVmallocChunk 536568999 kBp blockquote  pSo, am I right in assuming that the Mapped usage would never exceed the MemTotal.

Its trivial to implement a simple linked list, but I wonder if there is a mature library which includes some operations like sort, merge, splice, search, lowerupper bound, etc...p  pI know this is a dupe, but searching for python list on any search engine gives predictably poor results, with most people just saying that linked lists are unneeded in python pfft.p  pPS I need to insert and remove from anywhere in the list, not just the ends.p  pOK, you asked for it I need to maintain an ordered list of several hundred thousand entries. I will iterate over the list forwards one by one, using a visitor on each entry, starting from the beginning or a position found by a binary search. When an entry matching a predicate is found it is removed from the list, and then, another binary search is performed on a subset of the list beginning from the removed entrys previous position, until a position determined statistically beforehand. Ignoring the error condition, the modified entry may be used to create another linked list which is spliced into the new position found through the second binary search. Iteration is continued from the position where the entry was removed. On occasion, several thousand contiguous ordered entries may be added toremoved from any place in the list. Sometimes several thousand noncontiguous entries must be searched for and removed incrementally.p  ppythons list is unnacceptable as the cost of insertionremoval is prohibitive, and the minor gains in speed for the binary search are totally irrelevant to the total cost. Our in house emtests confirm thisem.p  pif I have neglected any detail perhaps I can email you a copy of my companys nondisclosure agreement and I can privately correspond with you on the matter. emsarcasm.endem.p

Negative 92541 pI am writing an automatic grader program under linux.  There are several graders written in MATLAB, so I want to tie them all together and let students run a program to do an assignment, and have them choose the assignment.  I am using a C main program, which then has mcccompiled MATLAB libraries linked to it.p  pSpecifically, my program reads a config file for the names of the various matlab programs, and other information.  It then uses that information to present choices to the student.  So, If an assignment changes, is added or removed, then all you have to do is change the config file.p  pThe idea is that next, the program invokes the correct matlab library that has been compiled with mcc.  But, that means that the libraries have to be recompiled if a grader gets changed.  Worse, the whole program must be recompiled if a grader is added or removed.  So, I would like one, simple, unchanging matlab library function to call the grader mfiles directly.  I currently have such a library, that uses eval on a string passed to it from the main program.p  pThe problem is that when I do this, apparently, mcc absorbs the grader mcode into itself changing the grader m code after compilation has no effect.  I would like for this not to happen.  It was brought to my attention that Mathworks may not want me to be able to do this, since it could bypass matlab entirely.  That is not my intention, and I would be happy with a solution that requires a full matlab install.p  pMy possible solutions are to use a mex file for the main program, or have the main program call a mcc library, which then calls a mex file, which then calls the proper grader.  The reason I am hesitant about the first solution is that Im not sure how many changes I would have to make to my code to make it work my code is C, not C, which I think makes things more complicated.  The 2nd solution, though, may just be more complicated and ultimately have the same problem.p  pSo, any thoughts on this situation  How should I do thisp

Negative 92541 pIve been analyzing a recurring bug report perf issue in one of our systems related to a particularly slow delete operation.  Long story short It seems that the codeCASCADE DELETEcode keys were largely responsible, and Id like to know a if this makes sense, and b why its the case.p  pWe have a schema of, lets say, widgets, those being at the root of a large graph of related tables and relatedtorelated tables and so on.  To be perfectly clear, deleting from this table is actively discouraged it is the nuclear option and users are under no illusions to the contrary.  Nevertheless, it sometimes just has to be done.p  pThe schema looks something like thisp  precodeWidgets         Anvils [11]                 AnvilTestData [1N]         WidgetHistory 1N                   WidgetHistoryDetails 1N codepre  pColumn definitions look like the followingp  precodeWidgets WidgetID int PK, WidgetName varchar50 Anvils AnvilID int PK, WidgetID int FKIXUNIQUE, ... AnvilTestData AnvilID int FKIX, TestID int, ...Test Data... WidgetHistory HistoryID int PK, WidgetID int FKIX, HistoryDate datetime, ... WidgetHistoryDetails HistoryID int FKIX, DetailType smallint, ... codepre  pNothing too scary, really.  A codeWidgetcode can be different types, an codeAnvilcode is a special type, so that relationship is 11 or more accurately 10..1.  Then theres a large amount of data  perhaps thousands of rows of codeAnvilTestDatacode per codeAnvilcode collected over time, dealing with hardness, corrosion, exact weight, hammer compatibility, usability issues, and impact tests with cartoon heads.p  pThen every codeWidgetcode has a long, boring history of various types of transactions  production, inventory moves, sales, defect investigations, RMAs, repairs, customer complaints, etc.  There might be 1020k details for a single widget, or none at all, depending on its age.p  pSo, unsurprisingly, theres a codeCASCADE DELETEcode relationship at every level here.  If a codeWidgetcode needs to be deleted, it means somethings gone terribly wrong and we need to erase any records of that widget ever existing, including its history, test data, etc.  Again, nuclear option.p  pRelations are all indexed, statistics are up to date.  Normal queries are fast.  The system tends to hum along pretty smoothly for everything except deletes.p  pGetting to the point here, finally, for various reasons we only allow deleting one widget at a time, so a delete statement would look like thisp  precodeDELETE FROM Widgets WHERE WidgetID  WidgetID codepre  pPretty simple, innocuous looking delete... strongthat takes over 2 minutes to runstrong, for a widget with strongno datastrongp  pAfter slogging through execution plans I was finally able to pick out the codeAnvilTestDatacode and codeWidgetHistoryDetailscode deletes as the suboperations with the highest cost.  So I experimented with turning off the codeCASCADEcode but keeping the actual FK, just setting it to codeNO ACTIONcode and rewriting the script as something very much like the followingp  precodeDECLARE AnvilID int SELECT AnvilID  AnvilID FROM Anvils WHERE WidgetID  WidgetID  DELETE FROM AnvilTestData WHERE AnvilID  AnvilID  DELETE FROM WidgetHistory WHERE HistoryID IN      SELECT HistoryID     FROM WidgetHistory     WHERE WidgetID  WidgetID  DELETE FROM Widgets WHERE WidgetID  WidgetID codepre  pBoth of these optimizations resulted in significant speedups, each one shaving nearly a full minute off the execution time, so that the original 2minute deletion now takes about 510 seconds  at least for emnewem widgets, without much history or test data.p  pJust to be absolutely clear, there is still a codeCASCADEcode from codeWidgetHistorycode to codeWidgetHistoryDetailscode, where the fanout is highest, I only removed the one originating from codeWidgetscode.p  pFurther flattening of the cascade relationships resulted in progressively less dramatic but still noticeable speedups, to the point where deleting a emnewem widget was almost instantaneous once all of the cascade deletes to larger tables were removed and replaced with explicit deletes.p  pIm using codeDBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERScode and codeDBCC FREEPROCCACHEcode before each test.  Ive disabled all triggers that might be causing further slowdowns although those would show up in the execution plan anyway.  And Im testing against older widgets, too, and noticing a significant speedup there as well deletes that used to take 5 minutes now take 2040 seconds.p  pNow Im an ardent supporter of the SELECT aint broken philosophy, but there just doesnt seem to be any logical explanation for this behaviour other than crushing, mindboggling inefficiency of the codeCASCADE DELETEcode relationships.p  pSo, my questions arep  ul lipstrongIs this a known issue with DRI in SQL Serverstrong I couldnt seem to find any references to this sort of thing on Google or here in SO I suspect the answer is no.pli lipstrongIf not, is there another explanation for the behaviour Im seeingstrongpli lipstrongIf it is a known issue, why is it an issue, and are there better workarounds I could be usingstrongpli ul

Negative 92541 pI have a MS SQL database with a table that stores geocoded PICKUP locations which I eventually may or may not want to display depending on search filters the user selects. These are not static like a brick and mortar store locations. They are added by the applications users 24 hrs a day. The life of a LOAD is less than 24 Hrs. Once it has been picked up, the load is removed from the table. A LOAD is defined in the table with some basic demographic details along with specific LAT and LONG.p  pI am planning on using OpenStreetMaps to provide my base maps and also my interstateroadway information. I am planning to use OpenLayers to display the map in my web App.p  pTruck Drivers refer to major interstates often as Shipping Lanes.

Negative 92541 pIm writing an app for shape manipulation, such that after creating simple shapes the user can create more complex ones by clipping the shapes against each other i.e. combining two circles together into a figure 8 stored using a single path rather than a group, or performing intersection of two circles to create a bite mark, and am trying to decide on a graphics library to use.p  pSVG seems to handle 80 of the functionality I need out of the box shape storage, movement, rotation, scaling. The problem is that the other 20 using clipping to create a new set of complex polygons seems impossible to achieve without recreating SVG functionality in my own modules Id have to store the shape once for drawing inside SVG, and once for processing clipping myself. I could be wrong about SVG, but by reading about Raphael library based on SVG, it seems like it only handles clipping using a rectangle, and even that clipping is temporary it only renders part of the shape, but still stores entire shape to be rerendered once the clipping rectangle is moved. Perhaps Im just confused about SVG standard, but even retrievingparsing the paths to compute a new path using subsets of previous paths seems nonobvious in SVG there is a Subpath function, but I dont see anything to find the points of intersection of two polygon perimeters, or combine several subpaths into a single path.p  pAs a result, Canvas seems like a better alternative since it doesnt introduce the extra overhead by keeping track of shapes Id already have to keep track of to make my own clipping implementation work. Not only that, Ive already implemented the polygon class that can be moved, rotated, and scaled. Canvas has some other issues, however Id have to implement my own redraw method, which Im sure will not be as efficient as SVG one that takes advantage of browserspecific frameworks in Chrome and Firefox and Id have to accept IE incompatibility which is handled for free with libraries like Raphael.p  pThanksp
Negative 92541 pIve noticed a pattern that can make refactoring MVC2 apps difficult. When you change the name of an argument for an action you must update the values everywhere that action is used.

Negative 92541 pThis has probably been asked over and over but I couldnt find anything useful so here it goes again...p  pIn my application I need to render a fairly large mesh a couple of million triangles or more and Im having some problems getting decent frame rates out of it. The CPU is pretty much idling so Im definitely GPUbound. Changing the resolution doesnt affect performance, so its not fragment or rasterbound.p  pThe mesh is dynamic but locally static so I cannot store the whole thing in the video card and render it with one call. For application specific reasons the data is stored as an octree with voxels in the leafs, with means I get frustum culling basically for free. The vertex data consist of coordinates, normals and colors  no textures or shaders are used.p  pMy first approach was to just render everything from memory using one big codeSTREAMDRAWcode VBO, which turned out to be too slow. My initial thought was that I was perhaps overtaxing the bus pushing 150 MiB per frame, so I implemented a caching scheme that stores geometry recently used to render the object in static VBOs on the graphics card, with each VBO storing a couple of 100 KiB to a couple of MiB worth of data storing more per VBO gives more cache thrashing, so theres a tradeoff here. The picture below is an example of what the data looks like, where everything colored red is drawn from cached VBOs.p  pimg srchttpgimaker.users.sourceforge.net0010.png altExample of the rendered datap  pAs the numbers below show, I dont see a spectacular increase in performance when using the cache. For a fully static mesh of about 1 million triangles I get the following frame ratesp  ul liWithout caching 1.95 Hzli liCaching using vertex arrays 2.0 Hz 75 of the mesh is cachedli liCaching using codeSTATICDRAWcode VBOs 2.4 Hzli ul  pSo my questions is how do I speed this up I.e.p  ul liWhats the recommended vertex format to get decent performance I use interleaved storage with positions and normals as codeGLFLOATcode and codeGLUNSIGNEDBYTEcode for colors, with one padding byte to get 4byte alignment 28 bytesvertex total.li liWhether using the same buffer for normals for all my boxes might help all boxes are axisaligned so I can allocate a normal buffer the size of the largest cache entry and use it for them all.li liHow do I know which part of the pipeline is the bottleneck I dont have a spectacular video card Intel GM965 with open source Linux drivers so its possible that I hit its limit.

Negative 92541 pI have two Python scripts which I am running on Windows with IronPython 2.6 on .NET 2.0. One outputs binary data and the other processes the data. I was hoping to be able to stream data from the first to the second using pipes. The problem I encountered here is that, when run from the Windows commandline, codesys.stdoutcode uses CP437 character encoding and text mode instead of binary mode codewcode instead of codewbcode. This causes some bytes greater than 127 to be written as the wrong character i.e., different byte values produce the same character in the output and are thus indistinguishable by the script reading them.p  pFor example, this script prints the same character an underscore twicep  precodeimport sys sys.stdout.writechr95 sys.stdout.writechr222 codepre  pSo when I try to read the data I get something different than what I originally wrote.p  pI wrote this script to check if the problem was writing in codewcode mode or the encodingp  precodeimport sys str  chr222   try writing chr222 in ASCII in both write modes  ASCII is the default encoding openasciiw, w.writestr openasciiwb, wb.writestr   set encoding to CP437 and try writing chr222 in both modes reloadsys sys.setdefaultencodingcp437 opencp437w, w.writestr opencp437wb, wb.writestr codepre  pAfter running that, the file codecp437wcode contains character 95 and the other three each contain character 222. Therefore, I believe that the problem is caused by the combination of CP437 encoding and writing in codewcode mode. In this case it would be solved if I could force codestdoutcode to use binary mode Im assuming that getting it to use ASCII encoding is impossible given that cmd.exe uses CP437. This is where Im stuck I cant find any way to do this.p  pSome potential solutions I found that didnt workp  ul lirunning codeipy ucode doesnt seem to have any effect I also tested to see if it would cause Unixstyle newlines to be printed it doesnt, so I suspect that codeucode doesnt work with IronPython at allli liI cant use a hrefhttpcode.activestate.comrecipes65443sendingbinarydatatostdoutunderwindows relnofollow titleSending binary data to stdout under Windows Pythonthis solutiona because codemsvcrtcode is not supported in IronPythonli liwith Python 3.x you can access unbuffered codestdoutcode through codesys.stdout.buffercode this isnt available in 2.6li licodeos.fdopensys.stdout.fileno, wb, 0code just returns codestdoutcode in codewcode modeli ul  pSo yeah, any ideas Also, if theres a better way of streaming binary data that doesnt use codestdoutcode, Im certainly open to suggestions.p

Negative 92541 pMy organization currently delivers a web application primarily based on a SQL Server 20052008 back end, a framework of Java modelscontrollers, and ColdFusionbased views.  We have decided to transition to a newer framework and after internal explorations and mini projects have narrowed the choice down to between Python and C.NET.p  pLet me start off by saying that strongI realize either technology will work great, and am looking for the key differentiators and associated pros and consstrong  These languages have a lot in common, and a lot notIm looking for your take on their key differences.p  pemExample tradeoffdifferentiator I am looking foremp  pWhile it seems you can accomplish more with less code and be more creative with Python, since .NET is more structured it may be easier to take over understanding and modifying code somebody else wrote.p  pemSome extra information that may be usefulemp  pOur engineering team is about 20 large and we work in small teams of 57 of which we rotate people in and out frequently.

Negative 92541 pI created an codeh1code element that gets a class added to it and removed from it with a duration of 300ms when the mouse hovers over and off of its containing DIV codelogocode using strongjQuerystrongs code.hovercode method in concert with strongjQuery UIstrongs code.addClasscode and code.removeClasscode methods. p  pIt works splendidly but only when the user hovers over codelogocode and stops to wait for .addClass method to complete adding the new class to the codeh1code which takes 300 milliseconds total. If however the user moves off of the codelogocode DIV before the code.addClasscode methods 300 milliseconds are up, the jQuery code.addClasscode or code.removeClasscode methods gets paralyzed. Trying to move the cursor back into the codelogocode does not affect the codeh1code anymore. It is locked into place for good until a browser refresh. Unacceptable.p  pYou can view and try out a hrefhttpjsbin.comoxano36edit relnofollowmy example at JS Bin over here a. p  pTry hovering over the codelogocode DIV box in the center of the screen slowly, you know, wait for the animation to complete.

Negative 92541 pIs it safe to start a thread pool in an objects constructor I know that you shouldnt start a thread from a constructor, something about the this pointer escaping I dont exactly understand this, but will do some more searches to try and figure it out.p  pThe code would look something like thisp  precodeprivate ExecutorService pool  public handler    pool  Executors.newCachedThreadPool   public void queueInstructionSetInstructionSet set    pool.submitnew Runnable that handles this instruction set  codepre  pIf that doesnt work, i could just create this class as a Runnable and start it in a new thread. However, that seems like it would be adding an unnecessary thread to the program where it doesnt really need one.p  pThanks.p  pEDITp  pThanks for the replies everyone, they definitely helped make sense of this. p  pAs per the code, in my mind it makes sense that this constructor creates the thread pool, but let me explain what specifically this code is doing, because i may be thinking about this in a weird way.p  pThe entire point of this object is to take Instruction Sets objects, and act on them accordingly. The instruction sets come from clients connected to a server. Once a full instruction set is received from a client, that instruction set is sent to this object handler for processing.p  pThis handler object contains a reference to every object that an instruction set can act upon. It will submit the instruction set to a thread pool, which will find which object this instruction set wants to interact with, and then handle the instruction set on that object.p  pI could handle the instruction set object in the IO server, but my thoughts are having a separate class for it makes the entire code more readable, as each class is focusing on doing only one specific thing.p  pThoughts Advicep  pThanksp

Negative 92541 pI have a framework in C which is dependent on a few third party libraries. When I compile a static version of the strikelibrarystrike framework, no additional dependencies are needed, that is, the codelibcode files of the third part libraries are not needed. When I compile the same framework as a codeDLLcode, additional dependencies are now needed otherwise I get linking errors. I can guess as to why this is happening but would like a concrete answerexplanation to understand what is happening.p  pstrongEDITstrong Just to clarify, I am developing a framework which can be compiled as a codelibcode and as a codedllcode and emthenem used in an executable project. When compiling the framework as a codelibcode and using functions from a third party library, I dont need additional dependencies. However, a project that now uses the codelibcode file which is the framework must include the 3rd party codelibcode files. When I compile the framework as a codedllcode it gives me linking errors unless I specify the 3rd part libraries the framework is technically dependent on. For example I have a few classes that call functionality from within Ogre3D. These classes are compiled as a codelibcode file. I dont need to link against codeOgreMain.libcode when compiling a codelibcode of the classes. On the other hand, when I am compiling a codedllcode version of the same classes, I now need to link against codeOgreMain.libcodep

Negative 92541 pok, I tried searching and have not found an answer to this  I am curious how the ROLLBACK handles race conditions. For examplep  pIf I have a table CompanyAccount which keeps track of how many credits an company has available for purchase there is only one row in a database table per company and there are potentially multiple users from the same company who can decrement the credits from the single company account, what happens in case of an error when a ROLLBACK occursp  pExamplep  pAssumptions I have written the update properly to calculate the Credit new balance instead of guessing what the new credit balance is i.e. we dont try to tell the UPDATE statement what the new Credit balancevalue is, we say take whatever is in the credit column and subtract my decrement value in the UPDATE statement...p  phere is an example of how the update statement is writtenp  pUPDATE dbo.CompanyAccount            SET Credit  Credit  DecrementAmount          WHERE CompanyAccountId  CompanyAccountId p  pIf the Credit column has 10,000 credits. User A causes a decrement of 4,000 credits and User B causes a decrement of 1000 credits. For some reason a rollback is triggered during User As decrement there are about a 12 dozen more tables with rows getting INSERTED during the TRANSACTION. If User A wins the race condition and the new balance is 6,000 but not yet COMMITed what happens if User Bs decrement occurs before the rollback is applied does the balance column go from 6,000 to 5,000 and then gets ROLLBACK to 10,000 p  pI am not too clear on how the ROLLBACK will handle this. Perhaps I am oversimplifying. Can someone please tell me if I misunderstand how ROLLBACK will work or if there are other risks I need to worry about for this style.p  pThanks for your input.p

Negative 92541 pI have a couple of questions that are all interrelated. Basically, in the algorithm I am implementing a word codewcode is defined as four bytes, so it can be contained whole in a codeuint32tcode. p  pHowever, during the operation of the algorithm I often need to access the various parts of the word. Now, I can do this in two waysp  precodeuint32t w  0x11223344 uint8t a  w amp 0xff000000 gtgt 24 uint8t b  w amp 0x00ff0000 gtgt 16 uint8t b  w amp 0x0000ff00 gtgt  8 uint8t d  w amp 0x000000ff codepre  pHowever, part of me thinks that isnt particularly efficient. I thought a better way would be to use union representation like sop  precodetypedef union      struct              uint8t d         uint8t c         uint8t b         uint8t a          uint32t n  word32 codepre  pUsing this method I can assign codeword32 w  0x11223344code then I can access the various  parts as I require codew.a11code in little endian.p  pHowever, at this stage I come up against endianness issues, namely, in big endian systems my struct is defined incorrectly so I need to reorder the word prior to it being passed in.p  pThis I can do without too much difficulty. My question is, then, is the first part various bitwise ands and shifts efficient compared to the implementation using a union Is there any difference between the two generally Which way should I go on a modern, x8664 processor Is endianness just a red herring herep  pI could inspect the assembly output of course, but my knowledge of compilers is not brilliant. I would have thought a union would be more efficient as it would essentially convert to memory offsets, like sop  precodemov eax, [r98] codepre  pWould a compiler realise that is what happening in the bitshift case abovep  pIf it matters, Im using C99, specifically my compiler is clang llvm.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 92541 pI read about DynamicVertexBuffer, and how its supposed to be better for data that changes often. I have a world built up by cubes, and I need to store the cubes vertices in this buffer to draw them to the screen.p  pHowever, not all cubes have vertices some are air, which is transparent and not all faces of the cubes need to be drawn either they are facing each other, so how do I keep track of what vertices are stored where in the buffer Also, certain faces need to be drawn last, namely the ones with transparency in them like glass or leaves, and these faces also need to be drawn in a backtofront order to not mess up the alpha blending.p  pIf all of these vertices are stored arbitrarily in this buffer, how do I know what vertices are wherep  pAlso, the number of vertices can change, but the DynamicVertexBuffer doesnt seem very dynamic to me, since I cant change its size at all. Do I have to recreate the buffer every time I need to add or remove facesp

Negative 92541 pI have a project that was building fine in VS 2008, and then we installed and started using TFS Build, and then we upgraded to TFS 2010.  Everything was still fine and building correctly after I implemented our new build process that made everything very nice with a singleclick build initiation from any remote Visual Studio 2010 client.  Visual Studio did not need to be installed on the Build Agent.  Im trying very hard emveryem hard not to install Visual Studio on the Build Agent because my understanding is that its not necessary, and were not licensed to install it on a nondevelopment machine.p  pNow I tried upgrading the solution to VS 2010, still targeting .NET 3.5 because its an assembly targeted for SQL Server CLR procedures, and SQL Server doesnt support .NET 4.0 yet.  But I simply cannot make it build any more under TFS Build.  I cant seem to get a consistent error message from TFS Build and from an MS Build command line, but I think it has something to do with Microsoft.Cpp.Targets not being in CProgram FilesMSBuild because I havent installed Visual Studio.  I did install the Microsoft Windows SDK 7.1 so that I could run the .NET 4.0 SDK tools like svcutil for some other .NET 4.0 projects, but nothing seems to install what this build wants.  The error TFS build gives me isp  blockquote   pCTFSBld[...]GenerateLanguageGenerateLanguage.vcxproj46,3   error MSB4019 The imported project   CMicrosoft.Cpp.Default.props was   not found. Confirm that the path in   the  declaration is correct,   and that the file exists on disk.p blockquote  pAnd when I click on that error it takes me to this line in the vcxproj filep  precode  ltImport ProjectVCTargetsPathMicrosoft.Cpp.Default.props gt codepre  pAll I really need to do in this project is run resgen to generate resources files from resx files, and compile them into sattelite assemblies.  I was using a makefile build to do this, manually running resgen I think it was because I cant find a way to compile sattelite assemblies as a standalone solution any other way, and then compile those into a DLL I cant remember how that worked now, but I think it was manually running AL.exe to compile DLL files from resources files.  So basically I just need to run command lines to build this project, and I cant seem to find a reasonable way to do it without throwing out the entire project and editing the TFS build script to run a bunch of hardcoded command lines instead.  Theres got to be a better way.p  pIve been at this all day, and tried writing my own .targets file and .xml property sheets to take the place of the standard file, but its way over my head.  I tried simply deleting the  lines, but then MSBuild complains that theres no Build target.  I tried adding a dummy  to the vcxproj file, but then it didnt seem to run the pre and postbuild steps where all the work is done.p

If I check the generated schema, I see to table, one for Drawing and one for for DrawingVersion. I can read, update and delete without any problems.p  pThe problem appeared when I wanted to add a timestamp to my entities. At first I did the naive thing. I added the following in DbEntityBasep  precode    public byte[] Timestamp  get set  codepre  pAnd those line in my contextp  precode        Versionning mapping         modelBuilder.EntityltDbEntityBasegt             .Propertye gt e.Timestamp             .IsConcurrencyToken             .HasColumnTypetimestamp             .HasDatabaseGeneratedOptionDatabaseGeneratedOption.Computed codepre  pHowever, during the schema generation, it fail with the following exceptionp  blockquote   pSystem.NotSupportedException  The   store generated pattern Computed is   not supported for properties that are   not of type timestamp  or   rowversion.p blockquote  pAt that point I was a little sacarstic. Well gee, that just so me, putting emtimestampem in the column type while I should have put emtimestampem instead. I tried putting rowversion instead, put it still didnt work. I also tried the TimestampAttribute directly on the property, but same error.p  pI tried to put the timestamp data on the child classes, but then I hit the following exceptionp  blockquote   pSystem.Data.Entity.ModelConfiguration.ModelValidationException    One or more validation errors were   detected during model generationp      pSystem.Data.Edm.EdmEntityType  Type   Portfolio.Repositories.Drawing is   derived from the type   Portfolio.Repositories.DbEntityBase   that is the type for EntitySet   PortfolioContext.DbEntityBases. Type   Portfolio.Repositories.Drawing   defines new concurrency requirements   that are not allowed for sub types of   base EntitySet types.p blockquote  pSo I guess I cant do that either. p  pI must say, I am very confused. Why is the exception telling me that I should use a timestamp, as it is exactly what I am doing Could that be a bug in the framework If no, is their any other way to add concurrency checking with a Table PerType mappingp  pI am using SQL Serve Ce 4.0 as my database.p

What I want to be able to do is to check that the starttime to endtime range of my particular Reservation model does not overlap with any other reservations. p  pSo if theres a reservation from 46pm on Wednesday the 2nd, there cant be another reservation anytime from 46pm.

Negative 92541 pIm trying to do something I thought would be rather simple. Ive an object that I move around stepwise, i.e. I receive messages every say 100 milliseconds that tell me your object has moved x pixels to the right and y pixels down. The code below simulates that by moving that object on a circle, but note that it is not known in advance where the object will be heading in the next step.p  pAnyway, that is pretty simple. But now I want to also tell the object, which is actually a set of subobjects, that it is being rotated.p  pUnfortunately, I am having trouble getting Raphal to do what I want. I believe the reason is that while I can animate both translation and rotation independently, I have to set the center of the rotation when it starts. Obviously the center of the rotation changes as the object is moving.p  pHeres the code Im using and you can view a live demo a hrefhttppub.n3rd.orgtmpraphael.html relnofollowherea.

Negative 92541 pI really hope someone can help me with this. I have two dynamic text boxes on stage  strap1 and strap2 respectively.p  pBoth text boxes use the same font just different styles. e.g strap1 is Arial regular, strap2 is arial black.p  pIn order to get a good antialias, I have embeded both fonts. The problem is that the top font overwrites the second. So instead of strap1 being arial normal and strap2 arial black, both textboxes are arial normal.p  pIs there anyway to avoid or fix this conflict i am using as3, CS5.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 92541 pIs it a basic principle on reading multicast data that if your application doesnt process the next datagram thats come in before another one comes in that the first one is essentially overwritten Ive done some experimenting and increasing receivebuffer sizes has no effect on what Im describing.

Negative 92541 pI recently received ap  blockquote   p...relocation RX866432 against a local symbol can not be used when making a shared object recompile with fPICp blockquote  perror while trying to compile a program as a shared library.p  pNow the solution to this is not too difficult recompile all dependencies with fPIC, but after some research it turns out that this problem is only present on x8664 platforms. On 32bit any position dependent code can still be relocated by the dynamic loader.p  pThe best a hrefhttpwww.x8664.orgpipermaildiscuss2004October005227.htmlanswera I could find isp  blockquote   px86 has support for .text relocations which is what happens when you have    positiondependend code.  This support comes at a cost, namely that every    page containing such relocation becomes basically unshared, even if it    sits in a shared library, thereby spoiling the very concept of shared    libs.  Hence we decided to disallow this on amd64 plus it creates    problems if the value needs more than 32bit, because all .text relocs only    have size word32p blockquote  pBut I dont find this quite adequate. If it is the case that relocations spoil the concept of shared libraries, why can it be done on 32bit platforms Also, if there were changes that needed to be made to the ELF format to support 64bit, then why were not all fields increased in size to accommodatep  pThis may be a minor point, but it is motivated by the fact that a the code in question is a scientific code and it would be nice not to have to take a performance hit and b this information was nye impossible to find in the first placep  p[Edit The Answerp  pawoodlands a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7216244whyisfpicabsolutelynecessaryon64andnoton32bitplatforms72170827217082answera is probably the best literal answer, servn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7216244whyisfpicabsolutelynecessaryon64andnoton32bitplatforms72186587218658addeda some good information.p  pIn a search to find more about different types of relocations I found a hrefhttpwww.benxos.comarchives133thisa and ultimately an a hrefhttpwww.x8664.orgdocumentationabi0.99.pdfx8664 ABI referencea see page 68 ]p

Negative 92541 pIm trying to model a very simple share trading simulator in rails to play with 3.1 and try and learn more about web backend stuff as opposed to UX where I normally sit.p  pso lets say youve got p  precodeUsers has many transactions Transactions belongs to users, companies Companies has many transactions codepre  pSo a User buys a number of shares in a company, and that creates a transaction record with the quantity column reflecting the number of shares bought for that particular transaction, the share price at the time, and a status column indicating whether things were bought or sold. For simplicities sake, and as this is a learning exercise, lets assume that 1 transaction contains only one buy OR sell eventp  pSo lets say the user, for some reason, buys and sells all kinds of strange quantities of the same company.p  pHell end up with multiple transaction rows, which must be queried and summed in order to figure out p  pfor each companyp  ul liif he owns any shares in it at allli lihow much he owns all buys  sellsli lietc.li ul  pSo my question is, is this model correct for this type of use It seems cumbersome if I want to, for example, write a page indicating what the user owns. It means running all kinds of sums of to determine if owned, and amount owned. But maybe thats just how these things should be done Or is there a better wayp  pWould it be better to maintain only one transaction representing ownership, and update the columns in it for each company owned and then record individual transactions in a second, transactionhistory table that is separated out and joined to transactionp

BUt lets say I wanted to call the scalar UDF from another database on the same server, then Id end up with an unknown type error. p  pIve tried creating the type on the calling DB, but obv. then I get a type mismatch because although each of the UDTs have the same name, they have different scopes and therefore are different types. p  pI know you can create CLR types, register the assembly to SQL Server, and then access the custom type universally. p  pMy idea is to create a CLR UDT of type TABLE, however I cant see how this can be implemented, as I know it must be of CLR type SqlDbType.Structured p  pMy questions are p  ol liIs there a way without using the CLR to create global scope in SQL 2008 R2 for a table variable, and if not... li liHow can I define a UDT in C CLR, in which the UDT is essentially a UDT AS TABLEli ol

Negative 92541 pIs there a way to catch all queries and modify them before being sent to the db outside of modifying DBactiverecord.php This would be ideal, though Im not averse to modifying this file if its the only option. p  pI could just call this stuff from the models, but would feel better if this was something that was done in the background so as not to leave room for forgetting when and where its happening itd be best to have id done in the background. p  pIm using a library to encrypt query data. In the lib, Im checking for certain keys to not encrypt, so its not just a matter of encrypting all data, but some data in each query. p  pFor example, modifying insert like sop  precodefunction inserttable  , set  NULL      if   isnullset              thisgtCI amp getinstance         thisgtCIgtloadgtlibrarymyencrypt         set  thisgtCIgtmyencryptgtencryptqueryset         thisgtsetset      codepre  pworks correctly to encrypt the data before sending to the db. However, this does nothing for updatessets nor decryption. p  pIs there a way to set up an intermediary something or other that acts as a gobetween between models and active record where I could encrypt and decrypt the relevant data before sending it on to AR or back to the modelp  pthanks.p  hr  h2UPDATEh2  pSo following the guide below, I was able to get this working. Im using pyroCMS ver. 1.3.2 community CI version 2.0.2 which had already done some of the legwork. p  pHeres what I did. p  pcodesystemcmscoreMYLoader.phpcode extends codeMXloadercode which extends codeCILoadercode so codeMXLoadercode is what we need to modify.p  hr  pcodesystemcmslibrariesMXLoader.phpcodep  pchange public function database top  precodepublic function databaseparams  , return  FALSE, activerecord  NULL      logmessagedebug, db loader from MXLoader       Grab the super object     CI amp getinstance       Do we even need to load the database class     if classexistsCIDB AND return  FALSE AND activerecord  NULL AND issetCIgtdb AND isobjectCIgtdb          return FALSE           requireonceBASEPATH.databaseDB.EXT       Load the DB class     db amp DBparams, activerecord      get the driver name, set its path and load er up     mydriver  configitemsubclassprefix.DB.dbgtdbdriver.driver     mydriverfile  APPPATH.core.mydriver.EXT      if fileexistsmydriverfile          requireoncemydriverfile         db  new mydrivergetobjectvarsdb           if return  TRUE          return db           CIAPPgtdb  DBparams, activerecord     return CIAPPgtdb  codepre  pThe important difference here from the article linked in the accepted answer is the setting of the db vars as pyro does it differently from regular CI. p  pThen in codesystemcmscorecode add the customized driver file codeMYDBmysqldriver.phpcode. This will then be loaded and these methods will be available in all models. Also, methods in here using the same name as in codeDBactiverec.phpcode will take precedence. e.g. adding an codeinsertcode method in MYDBmysqldriver.php will override the insert method in codeDBactiverec.phpcode.p

Negative 92541 pIve read plenty of questions and articles stating that converting from ASP.NET Webforms to MVC is near enough impossible. However I strongthinkstrong my scenario is different.p  pI foolishly started working a project about a year ago in Webforms, but the approach I took as far as I understand is very MVC like. I have disabled forms validation, dont use any postbacks, use URL rewriting and all page changes are AJAX requests that load the page contents of ContentPlaceHolders using a small hack, overriding the codeRenderControlcode method. Ive also used my own ORM and RESTful Service API in seperate projects, referenced in the website.p  pNow the system works really well, the pages are partially refreshed fine and the urls are changed when the ajax calls are made, so when the page is refreshed, it looks exactly the same.p  pNow Ive just been told I need to learn MVC for a new big project but I have to finish another project first, but Ive done a bit of reading on the subject and started a few Hello World apps, and it seems that the idea of ASP.NET MVC is pretty much exactly what I have already created.p  pWould StackOverflow still recommend against converting the Webforms application to MVC Are there any other benefits of converting to MVC, besides best practicesp

Negative 92541 pI have been challenged. I am unsure how to use multiprocessing without jython or cython or some other IronPython whatsahoosie, and have opted to use Threads for my multicore CentOS program. It reads a set of text files and outputs to a dictionary defined by hfreq on the outside of the defined functions.  If I have it sleep, it runs terribly slowly, seemingly on one core and works fine.p  pAdditionally, I do not know how to have it wait until both threads are done to actually output to file other than the sleep.time part, which completely defeats the purpose of speedp  pEXAMPLEp  precodehfreq [INSERT TEXT FILE ARRAYS HERE, RESPECTIVELY filenames0[] and filenames1[]] def count     some code here that writes frequency to hfreq def count1     some code here that writes frequency to hfreq as well, but using filenames1 t1Threadtargetcount,args t2Threadtargetcount1,args t1.start t2.start time.sleep15 No other known way to prevent the following from running immediately listhfreq.items list.sort OutputOpenFreq.txt, w [for statement that writes to file] Output.close codepre  pAnd that is where it ends.  If I run the program with no threading classes on its own, it gives about 1014 seconds of runtime.  If I try the threading approach halving the nonthreading array between the two threads, I get BOTH THREADS running for 14 seconds instead of the expected multicore usage.

Negative 92541 pCurrently I am working on getting system information via a Silverlight Embedded Application tied with a Silverlight Desktop App running in trusted mode, as this is the only method available to gather system information from a user without them tweaking their registry beforehand.p  pWhat I am wondering is if there is a more seemless way to gather system hardware information from Windows, silverlight would be fairly seemless but it requires that registry tweak in order to collect the data via a embedded app. Can Flash do this without a desktop componentp  pMainly just looking for a way to inbrowser fetch user system hardware information, RAM, CPU and etc. Obviously the user needs to grant permission, but something fully embedded would be awesome. Any suggestionsp

When the user enters this field, I want to hide the keyboard and show the date picker.  p  pThe issue I run into with my code so far is that the keyboard shows up when I enter any of the fields, but then does not disappear no matter what Ive tried.  p  pI could not find any sample app that has this feature and would like some direction on how to resolve this issue. p  pUPDATE I fixed the first part of this and now can hide my keyboard when I get to the date field.    p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7EJvb.png altHere is what it looks like when I click on the date fieldp  pThis was using the below code p  precode BOOLtextFieldShouldBeginEditingUITextField textField codepre  pp  precodeif  textField.tag  1        [self.view endEditingTRUE]      [lblDesc2 resignFirstResponder]     [lblTitle resignFirstResponder]     [lblExcerpt resignFirstResponder]      NSLogThe method was called for textField       [self showDatePicker]     return NO  else      return YES    codepre  pNow what I need to do is pull up the date picker and here is my code for that which is not working yet p  precode void showDatePicker  CGRect pickerFrame  CGRectMake0,250,325,0  datePicker  [[UIDatePicker alloc] initWithFramepickerFrame] [datePicker addTargetself actionselectorpickerChanged               forControlEventsUIControlEventValueChanged]  [scrollView addSubviewdatePicker]  NSDateFormatter df  [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init] df.dateStyle  NSDateFormatterMediumStyle  datePicker.datePickerMode  UIDatePickerModeDate  [datePicker release]     codepre  p.hp  precode    import ltUIKitUIKit.hgt     import QuoteViewController.h     import SubjectViewController.h     import CategoryViewController.h      class Quote, SubjectViewController, QuoteViewController      interface AddQuoteViewController  UIViewController ltUITextFieldDelegategt      private         UIDatePicker datePicker         UIBarButtonItem doneButton     this button appears only when the date picker is open         NSArray dataArray         NSDateFormatter dateFormatter          IBOutlet UITextField lblTitle         IBOutlet UITextField lblDesc2         IBOutlet UITextField lblDate         IBOutlet UITextView lblExcerpt         IBOutlet UITextField lblNote         QuoteViewController qvc         SubjectViewController svc         UITextField editingField         IBOutlet UIScrollView scrollView             property nonatomic, retain UIScrollView scrollView     property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UIDatePicker datePicker      property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UIBarButtonItem doneButton      property nonatomic, retain NSArray dataArray      property nonatomic, retain NSDateFormatter dateFormatter        IBActiondoneActionidsender     when the done button is clicked      IBActiondateActionidsender     when the user has changed the date picke values mdy      property nonatomic,assign QuoteViewController qvc     property nonatomic,assign SubjectViewController svc      end codepre  p.mp  precode    import AddQuoteViewController.h     import Category.h     import QuotesAppDelegate.h     import Quote.h     import QuoteMap.h       implementation AddQuoteViewController      synthesize svc, qvc     synthesize datePicker, doneButton, dataArray, dateFormatter, scrollView        Implement viewDidLoad to do additional setup after loading the view.      voidviewDidLoad          [super viewDidLoad]          self.title  Add Quote          self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem  [[[UIBarButtonItem alloc]                                                    initWithBarButtonSystemItemUIBarButtonSystemItemCancel                                                     targetself actionselectorcancelClicked] autorelease]          self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem  [[[UIBarButtonItem alloc]                                                     initWithBarButtonSystemItemUIBarButtonSystemItemSave                                                     targetself actionselectorsaveClicked] autorelease]          self.view.backgroundColor  [UIColor groupTableViewBackgroundColor]          self.dateFormatter  [[[NSDateFormatter alloc] init] autorelease]         [self.dateFormatter setDateStyleNSDateFormatterShortStyle]         [self.dateFormatter setTimeStyleNSDateFormatterNoStyle]          CGRect pickerFrame  CGRectMake0,250,325,0          datePicker  [[UIDatePicker alloc] initWithFramepickerFrame]         [datePicker addTargetself actionselectorpickerChanged               forControlEventsUIControlEventValueChanged]          [scrollView addSubviewdatePicker]          NSDateFormatter df  [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init]         df.dateStyle  NSDateFormatterMediumStyle          datePicker.datePickerMode  UIDatePickerModeDate          lblDate.tag  1          [datePicker release]                void viewWillAppearBOOLanimated          [super viewWillAppearanimated]          Set the textboxes to empty string.

Negative 92541 pI have a path including directory and file name.br I need to test if the filename is a valid, e.g. if the filesystem will allow me to create a file with such a name.br The filename emhas some unicode charactersem in it.p  pIts safe to assume the directory segment of the path is valid and accessible supI was trying to make the question more gnerally applicable, and apparently I wen too farsup.p  pI very much do not want to have to escape anything unless I emhaveem to. p  pId post some of the example characters I am dealing with, but apparently they get automatically removed by the stackexchange system. Anyways, I want to keep standard unicode entities like codecode, and only escape things which are invalid in a filename.p  hr  pHere is the catch. strongThere may or may not already be a file at the target of the path.strong I need to keep that file if it does exist, and not create a file if it does not.p  pBasically I want to check if I emcouldem write to a path strongwithout actually opening the path for writingstrong and the automatic file creationfile clobbering that typically entails.p  pAs suchp  precodetry     openfilename, w except OSError      handle error here codepre  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4102896checkwhetherapathisvalidinpythonfrom hereap  pIs not acceptable, because it will overwrite the existent file, which I do not want to touch if its there, or create said file if its not.p  pI know I can dop  precodeif not os.accessfilePath, os.WOK     try         openfilePath, w.close         os.unlinkfilePath     except OSError          handle error here codepre  pBut that will emcreateem the file at the codefilePathcode, which I would then have to codeos.unlinkcode.p  pIn the end, it seems like its spending 6 or 7 lines to do something that should be as simple as codeos.isvalidpathfilePathcode or similar.p  hr  pAs an aside, I need this to run on at least Windows and MacOS, so Id like to avoid platformspecific stuff.p  pp

Negative 92541 pIm a newbie to Wed Design, using Dreamweaver CS5.5 and infinite amounts of Googling to try and create a small Intranet site for the small business Im working for. Im trying to create a News page where the news page will look for a NewsItem.htm. My thinking is that the Marketing guy can create an article in word then save as htm and my page will look up the file and insert it into the page. So I have a folder callled content and the htm file resides in there. In my code I insert   precodeltinclude filecontentGroupNewsItem.htm gt codepre  pThis has two effects 1. Marks several tags as Invalid Markup Markup invalid because its an overlapping or undisclosed tag I know the Include File has done this because if I remove that line of code the errors disapear. 2. The jpeg within the GroupNewsItem.htm does not display in the browser although there is a space where it should go and the accompanying text does display. If I move the GroupNewsitem.htm to the root and amend the include file it solves the missing Jpeg but still has the Invalid Markup errors. br I am very open to suggestions, perhaps I should scrap this approach if there is a much better way of going about this task Due to my inexperience Id like to keep it as simple as possible.    p

Negative 92541 pI created a small Android project during my free time, and I decided to give a group of people I specifically know of to try the app out. The group of people created a forum community where everyone gathers around to share some of their own projects. They usually upload their programs written in C, Java, C, and sometimes give out tips to newcomers.p  pI wrote an app that does bitmap manipulation stuffs, and was hoping that others can easily test the app out without having to go through Google Play market. I just dont want my app to go entirely public to anyone in the market.p  pI told them that I am going to upload an Android app so they can check my project out. I understood that they are all not Android developers, so they havent seen anyone in the community upload an Android app onto the forums yet.p  pSo, I started to do a little research on this.p  pI thought about exporting the project as an unsigned Android app, but a Google search made me realize that unsigned Android app cant be installed onto an Android phone, even with Unknown sources  Allow installation of nonMarket apps ticked in the Settings  Security menu.p  pAnother way I tried to do is to selfsign the application. I give the app 1 year before the certification is invalid, signed the app by using the Eclipse  Export Android application wizard. I uploaded the app, and got notified by one of the group of people that the app cant be installed onto their phone.p  pThis is where I am stuck and now Im clearly in need of assistence. Is there a way you can upload an Android app onto a forum, let another user download the APK file, and install it onto their phone with no hassle Just want to keep this testing session in private, if it matters.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 92541 pIm working on a layout that needs to display a dynamic list of items. Each item has a defined UUID, a Namebanner text, an Image URL and a boolean to indicate if its selected  Ive also created a POJO to hold these. I created a custom layout to put the items in a grid view, two icons with banner text on it. It looks like thisp  precodeltFrameLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightmatchparent gt   ltRelativeLayout     androidididItemLayout     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightfillparent gt     ltImageView         androidididItemImage         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightfillparent         androidlayoutalignParentToptrue         androidbackgroundandroidcolortransparent gt     ltImageView         androidididItemOverlayImage         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightfillparent         androidlayoutalignParentToptrue         androidbackgroundandroidcolortransparent gt     ltTextView         androidididItemTextBanner         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutmargin2dp         androidbackgroundBF000000         androidgravitycenter         androidtextStylebold gt   ltRelativeLayoutgt ltFrameLayoutgt codepre  pIve created the Custom Adapter and the activity as well and Im having no issue getting all items read in, the images downloaded and encoded to bitmaps and the text banner being set. The problem is I want the selected state and image to change if the item is clicked.p  pI know I can add the codeGridView.setOnItemOnClickListenercode and inside I know which item as been selected as well as the parent view it comes from, but Im not sure how to get its selected state.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11326089androidgridviewkeepitemselectedThisa link uses state from a static list in the Adapter and is what Ive modeled after. I added the following method and called it from the codeGridView.setOnItemOnClickListenercode.p  precodepublic void itemSelectedView parent, int position      ifitems.getposition.isSelected              ImageView interestSelected  ImageViewparent.findViewByIdR.id.ItemOverlayImage         interestSelected.setImageResource0          else              ImageView interestSelected  ImageViewparent.findViewByIdR.id.ItemOverlayImage         interestSelected.setImageResourceR.drawable.overlay                 codepre  pThe first problem is obvious, Im not saving the state to my items array, but that is an easy fix. The real problem is only the first item is getting the overlay. So how do I alter the codeR.id.ItemOverlayImagecode for the item in the GridView selected and not just the first one Or am I going about this totally wrongp
Negative 92541 pWhile experimenting with the WebAPI with regards to creating RESTful web services one thing has been consistently bugging me What to do with nonnullable typesp  pExample objectp  precodepublic class Product      public Guid Id get set     public string Name get set     public decimal Price get set     public bool InStock get set  codepre  pExample Controller methodp  precodepublic void Put Product product     productRepository.Updateproduct  codepre  pExample json call PUTp  precode     Id 8E28961CC99E4EED9F3344D33C107A33,     Name Generic Bottled Water  codepre  pSo we are left with a now with a dilemma, the json call does not include the codePricecode or the codeInStockcode property in the request so deserialised codePrice0code and codeInstockfalsecode. At this stage it is now impossible to validate the request because we cannot know the they have intentionally set these values or if they are defaulted because they dont exist.p  pMAKE THEM NULLABLE I hear someone from the gallary cry. Yes indeed I could make all my value types nullable by adding that little codecode to the end of each declaration. This to me though is a terrible idea and an abuse of the nullable type. Model View Control are separate for a reason and if your model has to care about how the Controller is going to use it then you have already invalidated your sepration of concerns.p  pFORCE THEM TO PASS THROUGH ALL PROPERTIES I hear someone else cry. However this then leads to a waste of bandwidth as superfluous data flies back and fourth.p  pSo what is the answer then. My 2 cents on the matter are that if you dont want to compromise your core model for the sake of the controllers and you also dont want to force your api consumers to send the full object each and every time then you are left with one solution.p  pEverything that gets passed through is serialised to a collection and you then validate the collection to decide if all the needed properties exist. So you could end up with the followingp  precodepublic void Put Guid productId, Dictionaryltstring, objectgt productDictionary     ...retrieve and validate existing product.      if productDictionary.ContainsKeyPrice         existingProduct.Price  productDictionary[Price]      if productDictionary.ContainsKeyInStock         existingProduct.Price  productDictionary[InStock]      productRepository.UpdateexistingProduct  codepre  pI dont particulary like this way either if Im honest however I dont see a real alternative. I really dont want to make all my object properties nullable nor do I want to force the client to pass through all data. p  pDoes anyone have a better suggestion as to how to get around this issue Perhaps some validation clause or library that Im missing Some architectural pattern that can deal with thisp  pI truly feel that serialization to object model is a bit of a false economy.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pIve reopened this question because researching DTOs I really dont think they are the way forward. They increase complexity and reduce maintainability while at the same time not giving you anything over say a dictionary or collection.p

Negative 92541 pFirst, let me point out that Im new to programming Java Desktop GUIs. I have created a desktop pane that can hold multiple JInternalFrames. For now, each JinternalFrame contains the same GUI components and a new jInternalFrame Herein referred to as Internal Frame can be created via a menu item click. p  pThe elements on each internal Frame are as follows 3 Jlabels, 3 JTextFields, a Jbutton and a Jtable. After rendering the first Internal Frame I populate the 3 text fields with information and then click the button and a new row is added to the table. The row contains the information used to populate the text fields.p  pOpening a second Internal Frame gives me, visually, the exact interface of the first. I populate this frame in the same manner,click the button and voila, the table in the second frame is populated. p  pThe issue arises when I return to the previous internal frame. I can type into the text fields without issue but clicking the button to populate the table causes the table in the second Internal Frame to be populated. bI suspect that Im sharing a datamodel but am uncertain as to how to create distinct datamodels for jInternalFrame jTables when the GUI for each frame is the sameb.p  pBelow is the code as I am new to Java Desktop GUI development I followed one of the Oracle HowTos to render the internal Frame itself  very simple examplep  precodepublic class InternalFrames extends JFrame                          implements ActionListener   private static final long serialVersionUID  1L JDesktopPane desktop  JLabel label1 JLabel label2 JLabel label3 JLabel label4  JTextField text1 JTextField text2 JTextField text3  JTable table1  public InternalFrames     superPractice Internal Frames      int inset  50     Dimension screenSize  Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit.getScreenSize     setBoundsinset,inset,screenSize.width  inset2,screenSize.height  inset2     desktop  new JDesktopPane      createFrame     setContentPanedesktop      setJMenuBarsetMenuBar     protected JMenuBar setMenuBar      JMenuBar menuBar  new JMenuBar     JMenu menu  new JMenuDocument     menu.setMnemonicKeyEvent.VKD     menuBar.addmenu      JMenuItem menuItem  new JMenuItemNew     menuItem.setMnemonicKeyEvent.VKN     menuItem.setAcceleratorKeyStroke.getKeyStrokeKeyEvent.VKD, ActionEvent.ALTMASK     menuItem.setActionCommandNew     menuItem.addActionListenerthis     menu.addmenuItem      menuItem  new JMenuItemQuit     menuItem.setMnemonicKeyEvent.VKQ     menuItem.setAcceleratorKeyStroke.getKeyStrokeKeyEvent.VKQ, ActionEvent.ALTMASK     menuItem.setActionCommandQuit     menuItem.addActionListenerthis     menu.addmenuItem        return menuBar   public void actionPerformedActionEvent e     if New.equalse.getActionCommand         createFrame      else if Quit.equalse.getActionCommand          protected void createFrame     InternalFrame internalFrame  new InternalFrame      label1  new JLabelName     label2  new JLabelEmail Address     label3  new JLabelMobile Number     label4  new JLabelTest Frames      label1.setSize100,10     label2.setSize100,10     label3.setSize100,10     label4.setSize200,10      text1  new JTextField40     text2  new JTextField40     text3  new JTextField40      internalFrame.setLayoutnew MigLayout     internalFrame.getContentPane.addlabel1     internalFrame.getContentPane.addtext1, wrap     internalFrame.getContentPane.addlabel2     internalFrame.getContentPane.addtext2, wrap     internalFrame.getContentPane.addlabel3     internalFrame.getContentPane.addtext3,wrap     internalFrame.getContentPane.addlabel4, span 2, wrap     internalFrame.getContentPane.addnew JScrollPanecreateTable, span 2 2, wrap     internalFrame.getContentPane.addcreateButton       internalFrame.setVisibletrue     desktop.addinternalFrame      try           internalFrame.setSelectedtrue       catch java.beans.PropertyVetoException pve      protected JTable createTable     DefaultTableModel dModel  new DefaultTableModel     table1  new JTabledModel     dModel.addColumnName     dModel.addColumnEmail Address     dModel.addColumnMobile Number      return table1   protected JButton createButton     JButton button1  new JButtonAdd New List Member     button1.addActionListenernew ActionListener           public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                      Execute when button is pressed             System.out.printlnYou clicked the button             populateTabletable1                   return button1   protected void populateTableJTable theTable      if validateEntry  0              ListMembers listMember  new ListMembers         listMember.setNametext1.getText         listMember.setEmailAddresstext2.getText         listMember.setMobilePhonetext3.getText         Object[] data  listMember.getName,listMember.getEmailAddress,listMember.getMobilePhone         DefaultTableModel dm  DefaultTableModel table1.getModel         dm.addRowdata           private static void createAndShowGUI     JFrame.setDefaultLookAndFeelDecoratedtrue     InternalFrames internalFrame  new InternalFrames     internalFrame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE     internalFrame.setVisibletrue     public static void mainString[] args      javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable          public void run              createAndShowGUI                  codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 92541 pId like to figure out a way to alert a python script that a file is done copying. Here is the scenario p  ol lipA folder, codetoprintcode is being watched by the script by constantly polling with codeos.listdircode. pli lipEvery time codeos.listdircode returns a list of files in which a file exists that hasnt been seen before, the script performs some operations on that file, which include opening it and manipulating its contents. pli ol  pThis is fine when the file is small, and copying the file from its original source to the directory being watched takes less time than the amount of time remaining until the next poll by codeos.listdircode. However, if a file is polled and found, but it is still in the process of being copied, then the file contents are corrupt when the script tries to act on it. p  pInstead, Id like to be able to using codeos.statcode or otherwise know that a file is currently being copied, and wait for it to be done until I act on it if so. p  pMy current idea is to use codeos.statcode every time I find a new file, then wait until the next poll and compare the date modifiedcreated time since the last time I polled, and if they remain the same then that file is stable, otherwise keep polling until it is. Im not sure this will work though as I am not too familiar with how LinuxUnix updates these values. p

Here is my codep  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt  lt  function entere      ife.keyCode  13                Login          return false          gt  ltscriptgt        ltscript typetextJavaScriptgt       lt       function Login       var keyworddocument.getElementByIdaddress.value       var done0       keywordkeyword.toLowerCase       keywordkeyword.split .join       if keywordexample,example  window.locationhttpwww.example.com done1       if keywordexample1  window.locationhttpwww.example1.com done1       if keywordexample2  window.locationhttpwww.example2 done1       if done0  doSomethingElse               gt       ltscriptgt        ltform nameenterkeyword actionnonegt          ltinput namekeyword idaddress typetext onkeypressreturn entereventgt          ltdiv classbuttonsgt          ltbutton typebutton onclickLogingtSubmitltbuttongt          ltdivgt          ltformgt  codepre  pHere is where the problem is. I need to find a way to save every submitted query to excel or .CSV. I found a way that saves input data to .CSV file using PHP. I tested it and it works. BUT when i try to implement that with existing functions on my input form it messes up everything.

Currently, only items that have more content will expand and the shorter ones stop at the screen edge so they are 100 of screen vs. entire page.p  pAnyway here is my fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net2vP676 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net2vP676ap  pAnd here is the code within the postp  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv idwrappergt     ltdiv idnavWidegt ltdivgt     ltdiv idcontainerWidegt ltdivgt     ltdiv idcontainerTallgt         ltdiv idcontainergt             ltdiv idnavgt                 ltdiv idnavNavigategt Open Menu ltdivgt                 ltdiv idnavNavigateHidegt Close Menu ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idsideContainerTallgt         ltdiv idsideContainergt             ltdiv idsideNavgtSide Navigation ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precodewrapper      width100     minwidth1000px     height100     minheight100     positionrelative     top0     left0     zindex0  navWide      color ffffff     background222222     width100     minwidth1000px     height45px     positionfixed     top0     left0     zindex100  containerWide      width100     minwidth1000px     minheight100     positionabsolute     top45px     zindex100  containerTall      color 000000     backgrounddadada     width960px     minheight100     marginleft480px     positionabsolute     top0     left50     zindex1000   main container   container      width960px     minheight585px  nav      color ffffff     background222222     width960px     height45px     positionfixed     top0     zindex10000  navNavigate      backgroundyellow     fontsize10px     color888888     width32px     height32px     padding7px 6px 6px 6px     floatleft     cursorpointer  navNavigateHide      backgroundyellow     fontsize10px     color888888     width32px     height32px     padding7px 6px 6px 6px     floatleft     cursorpointer     displaynone  sideContainerTall      background888888     width264px     minheight100     marginleft480px     positionabsolute     top0     left50     zindex500  sideContainer      width264px     minheight585px     displaynone  sideContainerTall      background888888     width264px     minheight100     marginleft480px     positionabsolute     top0     left50     zindex500  sideContainer      width264px     minheight585px     displaynone  sideNav      width264px     height648px     floatleft  codepre  pstrongJavascriptstrongp  precodedocument.readyfunction       divnavNavigate.clickfunction           divnavNavigate.hide          divnavNavigateHide.show          divsideContainer.show          divcontainerTall.animate             left 264px                    divnavNavigateHide.clickfunction           divnavNavigate.show          divnavNavigateHide.hide         divcontainerTall.animate             left 264px         , function              divsideContainer.hide                 codepre

The raw contact number of the contact has been incremented by 1. Any ideas on how to make the change persistent in the SIM Yes, I know some doc says access to SIM is not supported.

Negative 92541 pI am writing a Javascript library in Coffeescript that is a thin layer over a Comet implementation CometD that communicates with a server. There are basically two types of things that happenp  ul liSome clientside Javascript code calls codelibrary.someActioncode and the action is sent to the serverli liSome event happens asynchronously and codelibrarycode needs to notify the clientside code of this event.li ul  pHeres the code for my current implementationp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comHarvardEconCSTurkServerblobmasterturkserverjsclientsrctsclient.coffee relnofollowhttpsgithub.comHarvardEconCSTurkServerblobmasterturkserverjsclientsrctsclient.coffeeap  pSame code translated to Javascript a hrefhttppastebin.comw4ABf1vd relnofollowhttppastebin.comw4ABf1vdap  pstrongFor the clientinitiated actionsstrong, there is a function in the library for each type of action. For example, sometimes the client needs to send the results of a quiz to the server, so there is this corresponding functionp  precode  sendQuizResults correct, total gt     channelSend serviceuser,       status Codec.quizResults       correct correct       total total codepre  pstrongFor the serverinitiated eventsstrong, the clientside code needs to register a callback for each type of event, so there are a whole pile of callbacks lying around and functions to set each of them. Namely, there are a huge bunch of the followingp  precode  requestUsernamecb  undefined    RequestUsername callback gt     requestUsernamecb  callback codepre  pIn the above example, if a codeRequestUsernamecode event is triggered, the client calls the coderequestUsernamecbcode if it exists.p  pThis seems like its starting to become a mess, so I was wondering if there are any good practices for creating a library like this, and organizing all the events and actions in a reasonable way. CS basically wraps all the functions above into a closure so they can be used as a JS object.p  pI have to admit Im one of those Javascript users that kind of just started using the language, and then jumped into Coffeescript for various reasons. If theres something I dont understand well about Javascript, then I would be happy to be enlightened however, I dont want this to go off topicturn into a flame war about CS vs JS or something else. Please limit your answers to best practices for this type of API in general.p

Negative 92541 pI have unfortunately decided to make my app using the IB, which I discovered was a terrible choice, but Im afraid I must deal with it. p  pSo originally, I had all my fields, buttons, etc, placed on a single view, with enough space left on the bottom that on the 3.5 screens everything displays neatly.p  pWell was that a terrible idea. Now I need to add just a few more things to the screen, and although it works in the 4 mode, 3.5 is out of luck. Ah ha, I thought, All I need to do is add a codescrollviewcode containing everything on my screen, and for the 3.5, it will scroll instead of reposition.p  pLong story short, I added my codesubviewcode, placed it as the very back object on my screen, draged all items into it... And I got a mess.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6RRRw.png altWhat a messp  pAint that just dandy.p  pAnyways, I would like to know if there is someway to get Xcode to not reposition all these elements when I do this, or, is there another way to get all these elements to become codesubviewscode under this codescrollviewcode.p

The table view contents were of a previous page, as well is the image and its size. Essentially, it is not calling my method which sets up the cell.

Negative 92541 pIm trying to build a simple interface that allows users to drop files into a codelistBoxcode to add them to a process, and to drag them out to remove them. Everything is working fine, but Id like to add one feature to make it just a tad more sophisticated. p  pRight now, I have the removal of the item tied to the codeDragLeavecode event, which means that as soon as the mouse leaves the box, the item is removed. But Id like for users to be able to change their minds. In other words, if they realize theyre dragging the wrong file out, Id like them to be able to move the mouse back into the codelistBoxcode and release the mouse to cancel the action. Im thinking that means I need to be able to capture the codeMouseUpcode event instead of the codeDragLeavecode event.

Negative 92541 pIm trying to debug some code. One odd part is that a codebeforesavecode callback is getting called twice, though Im only intending to save the object once.p  pTo trace how this is happening, Ive defined these methods in the classp  precodew[save save].each do methodname   definemethodmethodname do args     puts who called methodname caller.first     superargs   end end codepre  pFrom this output, I only see one persistence call.p  pI believe that codesavecode and codesavecode are the only methods that cause ActiveRecord to persist the objects. As far as I know, other persistence methods rely on one of these two for example, codeupdateattributescode calls codesavecode, codeupdateattributescode calls codesavecode, etc.p  pstrongDo any methods persist an ActiveRecord object without calling codesavecode or codesavecodestrongp  pIm using ActiveRecord 3.2.13p  h2Updateh2  pLooking in the Rails source for 3.2.13, both a hrefhttpsgithub.comrailsrailsblob3213activerecordlibactiverecordpersistence.rbL82savea and a hrefhttpsgithub.comrailsrailsblob3213activerecordlibactiverecordpersistence.rbL103savea call the private method codecreateorupdatecode to do their work. I used codegit grepcode to look for other occurrences of codecreateorupdatecode and only found tests and something in codecallbacks.rbcode that wraps it.p  pcodecreateorupdatecode in turn, relies on codeklass.connection.updatecode and codeself.class.unscoped.insertcode.p  pSo perhaps the question is whether anything other than codecreateorupdatecode persists an ActiveRecord object.p

Every Subject may be associated with multiple Processes. Depending on which Process is chosen there is a varying number of the entity ProcessProperty. In other words when the User associates a process with a subject he should only be able to edit the properties specifically linked to it.p  pUltimately I want the User to be able to do 3 thingsp  ol liCreating new Processes and specifying the Properties asscociated with itli liList all Processes of a certain Subject even if there are no Properties linked to itli liAssociate a Process with a Subject and only allow the predefined Properties to be evaluatedli ol  pSo the table design should be something likep  ul litblSubjectSubjectID,... li litblProcessProcessID,...li litblProcessPropertyPropertyID,...li litblRelationProcessPropertyRelationProcessPropertyID, ProcessID, PropertyIDli litblRelationSubjectProcessPropertyRelationID, RelationProcessPropertyID, SubjectID, PropertyValueli ul  pThis does obviously work as long as there is a Property associated with every Process.

I already understand the concepts presented in these questionsanswers, but I have more questions.p  pbAb What happens if you have multiple controls with codeAutoPostBackfalsecode and you change a number of them before a postback Take the following brief example assume that everything else needed for the page is written correctly and trivially e.g., codePageLoadcodep  pDefault.aspxp  precodeltaspDropDownList IDddlFoo runatserver      OnSelectedIndexChangedddlFooChanged AutoPostBackfalse gt     ltaspListItem Texta gt     ltaspListItem Textb gt     ltaspListItem Textc gt ltaspDropDownListgt ltaspDropDownList IDddlBar runatserver      OnSelectedIndexChangedddlBarChanged AutoPostBackfalse gt     ltaspListItem Text1 gt     ltaspListItem Text2 gt     ltaspListItem Text3 gt ltaspDropDownListgt ltaspButton IDbtnQux runatsever TextClick for PostBack OnClickbtnQuxClick codepre  pDefault.aspx.csp  precodeprotected void ddlFooChangedobject sender, EventArgs e      Response.WriteddlFoo changed to   ddlFoo.Text  .   protected void ddlBarChangedobject sender, EventArgs e      Response.WriteddlBar changed to   ddlBar.Text  .   protected void btnQuxChangedobject sender, EventArgs e   codepre  pNow, say you change codeddlFoocode to code3code and then codeddlBarcode to codebcode. Then, you click codebtnQuxcode. You get the following output from codeResponse.Writecode after clickingp  precodeddlBar changed to b. ddlFoo changed to 3.  codepre  pWhy does this happen Do the codeOnSelectedIndexChangedcode methods get put into a stack to be called once a postback happensp  pbBb Why does my webpage load much more quickly when I use this approach and set codeAutoPostBackfalsecode for most of my controls To be specific, I did this for a code CheckBoxcode, a codeDropDownListcode, and a codeTextBoxcode in a codeGridViewcode, which retrieved 1200 rows and 27 columns of data and took 10s in VS2008 debug mode versus 310s before. Why would the loadrefresh time be so much fasterp  pbEDITb I released the code earlier this afternoon, and there was no significant difference between the load time of the old codeAutoPostBacktruecode and new codeAutoPostBackfalsecode versions. I think that perhaps the debugger was doing something extra, which caused the large jump in load time. A better way to rephrase question bBb might be this then What could the debugger have been doing to cause this large jump in load timep

Negative 92541 pI am attempting to create an easy solution to file sharing across computers in my local network. I used to execute codepython m SimpleHTTPServercode in bash whenever I wanted to share a directory, but I wanted a way to share only one specific file. Can anyone point me in the right direction for how I might create a web server, and then have it download a file for each GET request. For example, someone on my network could go to my IP and have the file download. p  pP.S. What would be even cooler is if there was a way to password protect a file Also, I have Python 2.7.2, if that matters. Anyway, As you have probably noticed, I know almost nothing about Python, but I learn by example so I am hoping this will help me some as well.p  pThanks a bunch in advancep

Negative 92541 pIm trying to build a zoom in zoom out slider and buttons with jquery ui and backbone, but Ive run into an interesting problem. Ive made it the job of the model to set the zoom value, so that all you have to do is call that method in the view, and it handles the value update, but the problem is, when I do that it will lag one behind... what i mean is the start value is 8 you will press the zoom in button and youd think the zoom value would go to 9 but it lingers at 8 then the next time you click the button it goes to 9, and the next time you click it it goes to 10... and so on, but this lag causes a strange problem. Because Ive set a max and a min value for the slider Im checking to make sure that the zoom value stays within those bounds. but because there is this delay if you would... it will get to one below the max value and not allow you to increase it, but if you decrease the value by clicking the zoom out button it will, on the first click, change the value up to the max then on the second click it will go down to to 15 one below the max so Im very confused why this is happening. any help on this would be greatly appreciated... Ive included the code relevant to this problem below. if you dont understand something that Ive said or have a question...

Negative 92541 pI have a set of complex business objects that Id like to serialize to Json for use in a web service.  Im currently using the DataContractJsonSerializer to product the Json, but it balks on deserialization because the default XmlReader cant handle Base64 strings.  p  pAfter reading strongmanystrong positive reviews of Json.Net, I decided to give it a try.  Surprisingly, the simplest case produces erroneous output if the business object overrides the ToString method.  Instead of generating JSON, it simply emits the string value.p  pFor example, the following statement produces only a string, as the serializer appears to view the object as a simple string.p  precodepublic class MyClass      public string Titlegetset     public override ToString return Title      public string ToJson          return JsonConvert.SerializeObjectthis        codepre  pInstead of json formatted output, all I get is the title string.  Do I have to mark the object in some special way to avoid this  Since the business object hierarchy includes many objects that override ToString, I would rather avoid having to introduce special attributes, etc.p

Is there a way to do this with draganddrop at allp  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p  pBelow is the code from jsFiddle...p  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv idbraceletgt     ltdiv iddiv1 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltdivgt     ltdiv iddiv1 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltdivgt     ltdiv iddiv1 ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgtltdivgt ltdivgt ltbrgt ltbrgt ltbrgt ltbrgt ltbrgt ltdiv iddiv2 classdrop ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgt     ltimg iddrag1 srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommons44fButtonRed.svg ondragenddragEndevent draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent width50 height50gt ltdivgt ltdiv iddiv3 classdrop ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgt     ltimg iddrag2 srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsaa8ButtonBlue.svg  ondragenddragEndevent draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent width50 height50gt ltdivgt ltdiv iddiv4 classdrop ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgt     ltimg iddrag3 srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsccaButtonLightblue.svg  ondragenddragEndevent draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent width50 height50gt ltdivgt ltdiv iddiv5 classdrop ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgt     ltimg iddrag4 srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsbbaButtonPurple.svg  ondragenddragEndevent draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent width50 height50gt ltdivgt ltdiv iddiv6 classdrop ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgt     ltimg iddrag5 srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommons668ButtonOrange.svg  ondragenddragEndevent draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent width50 height50gt ltdivgt ltdiv iddiv7 classdrop ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgt     ltimg iddrag6 srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsddcButtonGreen.svg  ondragenddragEndevent draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent width50 height50gt ltdivgt ltdiv iddiv8 classdrop ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgt     ltimg iddrag7 srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommons44fButtonRed.svg  ondragenddragEndevent draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent width50 height50gt ltdivgt ltdiv iddiv9 classdrop ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgt     ltimg iddrag8 srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsaa8ButtonBlue.svg  ondragenddragEndevent draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent width50 height50gt ltdivgt ltdiv iddiv10 classdrop ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgt     ltimg iddrag9 srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsccaButtonLightblue.svg  ondragenddragEndevent draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent width50 height50gt ltdivgt ltdiv iddiv11 classdrop ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgt     ltimg iddrag10 srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsbbaButtonPurple.svg  ondragenddragEndevent draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent width50 height50gt ltdivgt ltdiv iddiv12 classdrop ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgt     ltimg iddrag11 srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommons668ButtonOrange.svg  ondragenddragEndevent draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent width50 height50gt ltdivgt ltdiv iddiv13 classdrop ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropeventgt     ltimg iddrag12 srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsddcButtonGreen.svg  ondragenddragEndevent draggabletrue ondragstartdragevent width50 height50gt ltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precodediv1      width50px     height50px     padding10px     border1px solid aaaaaa     display inline     float left     marginbottom 25px     marginleft 50px  .drop      width50px     height50px     padding10px     border1px solid aaaaaa     display inline     float left  bracelet      width420px     height75px     padding 10px     marginleft 30px     border1px solid aaaaaa     backgroundcolor gray  codepre  pJSp  precodefunction allowDropev      ev.preventDefault   function dragev      var el  ev.target     var parent  el.getAttributedataparent      ifparent         el.setAttributedataparent, el.parentNode.id           ev.dataTransfer.setDataText, el.id   function dropev      ev.preventDefault     var data  ev.dataTransfer.getDataText     ev.target.appendChilddocument.getElementByIddata   function dragEndev     ifev.dataTransfer.dropEffect  none          var parent  document.getElementByIdev.target.getAttributedataparent          parent.appendChildev.target       codepre

Negative 92541 pIm working on a kind of javascript textbased game engine. I have a javascript object with an onuse method. This works fantastically when I use it like thisp  precodevar button  new CanvasObject button.text  test  Necessary for the next code sample button.onuse  function button.x  1   Some simple reaction codepre  pI have code in a Canvas object that when drawing a CanvasObject will wrap it in a span tag like sop  precodeltspan onclick  function button.x  1 gttestltspangt  Or to make the HTML cleaner ltspan onclick  canvas.callFunction5gttestltspangt  where canvas.callFunction will call the function needed.  Canvas keeps an array of functions that can be called. codepre  pThe Canvas will call the function, and since it uses absolute terms, the line button.x  1, will work fine. The problem is that I have another class that I extended from CanvasObject, for example, ButtonObject. I want the class definition to have an onuse function that is already defined. For example using the inheritance technique lined out a hrefhttpwww.crockford.comjavascriptinheritance.html relnofollowhereap  precodeButtonObject.methodonuse, function    this.x  Some function requiring this.  codepre  pWhen I called a function from the HTML using the first technique, my engine would just call it as an anonymous function. Then, this then would be defined as the window. I want every instance of ButtonObject to have the same onuse function, so defining it each time like I did with CanvasObject seems like a lot of extra code. One possible solution I thought of was to modify the way my engine works such that each object is given a name property, that is equivalent to its javascript name. This way the engine could simple write the string like thisp  precodeinnerHTML   ltspan onclick  buttonObjectInstance.name  .onusegt  codepre  pBut this technique would require me to state the name of the object twice, every time I instantiate it, like thisp  precodevar startButton  ButtonObjectstartButton codepre  pIs this truly my only option Or is there way to call a function in the context of the object without having the name of that object p

Negative 92541 pstrongShortstrongp  pGitHub has grayed out folders in my repo that I cannot access.  This worries me, as my code changes are in those foldersp  pstrongLongstrongp  pI am developing a ZF2 web application and using git for source control.  ZF2 is modular, so somewhere somehow most likely with composer.phar or possibly with git clone I have downloaded some ZF2 modules into project subfolders.  One such ZF2 module is codevendorcoolcsncsnusercode.  I have made changes in that ZF2 module.p  pProblem 1  when I run git status, I get thisp  precode git status  On branch master  Changes not staged for commit        modified   vendorcoolcsncsnuser modified content, untracked content codepre  pWhen I run git commit, it says No changes added to commit.  And Ive definitely made some changes.p  pSo then I found that I can change my directory to codevendorcoolcsncsnusercode, and do git status and git commit there.  Then I can change back to the root directory of the project, and do a git commit there.  Then, all is fine....  untilp  pProblem 2  Until I do a git push to GitHub.  On GitHub my entire project seems to be in place, but the codevendorcoolcsncsnusercode is not accessible on GitHub  It is Grayed Out.  I cannot click on it.  It makes me cry.  I dont know why and I dont know whats up.  Ive read something about git submodules.  I dont know if I have git submodules or if they are something else.  I have not consciously set up any submodules myself.  Either way, I am concerned that my GitHub submodule changes are not being tracked, or if they are being tracked, they are hidden, not accessible for viewing.p  pPossible Solution 1  I thought that I could REMOVE .git folder in the submodules if they are submodules and just do straight commits to GitHub, with my codecsnusercode folder possibly not being grayed out.  But before I do so, Ive heard that it is not advisable, and I wanted to check on what all that is going on, and how if anyhow, I can properly use git and GitHub and submodules, and track my changes at the same time.p  pIn particular, looking for a set of steps, instructions, or ideas on how keep my repo accessible and committable both using git and GitHub.p

Negative 92541 pall Im a bit confused.p  pIs there inconsistency between document and code in library Control.Exceptionp  pThe document say that the function catch use the function mask on a handler function but a function try doesnt use a function mask.p  pBut the code say that the function try use the function catch.p  pI think that if the function catch use the function mask and the function try use the function catch, then the function try use the function mask.p  hr  pIn Control.Exception of ghc basepackage, the document sayp  pTheres an implied mask around every exception handler in a call to one of the catch family of functions. This is because that is what you want most of the time  it eliminates a common race condition in starting an exception handler, because there may be no exception handler on the stack to handle another exception if one arrives immediately. If asynchronous exceptions are masked on entering the handler, though, we have time to install a new exception handler before being interrupted. If this werent the default, one would have to write something likep  precode  mask  restore gt        catch restore ...              e gt handler codepre  pIf you need to unblock asynchronous exceptions again in the exception handler, restore can be used there too.p  pNote that try and friends do not have a similar default, because there is no exception handler in this case. Dont use try for recovering from an asynchronous exception. .p  pBut, the code sayp  ptry a  catch a   v  return Right v e  return Left ep

Negative 92541 pand thank you for your patience. I am an experienced coder using old school methods, and have used the old style of Javascript for many years. Ive known about JQuery, and such as that for a while, but have been too busy to learn the new things. Well, I am now working on learning those things, and have chosen AngularJS.p  pI am watching the tutorial videos, and reading the documents and API reference for AngularJS, but the different nomenclature does impede my progress. But Im trying. For me, using an example of a real sort of problem helps me to understand how to leverage the functionality. p  pIn this example, I have an array of Power Ball numbers, and want to be able to paste in the space delimited winning numbers you might copy off of the Power Ball site. This would then parse the input and hilite all of the individual numbers. Eventually, perhaps hiliting any winning combinations in different ways. No, this isnt a product Im building, but I thought this would cause me to use many different tools in this tool box. p  pSo my questions arep  ul liI initialized the array in my service factory and have shown that I can push to it from my controller. Is this correctli liIs my current way of doing things e.g. ngclass usage, etc. at least feasible, if not correctli liHow could I use space delimited input in the inputtext box to do the comparison for the style changesli ul  pHere is an example of my JavaScript code. note Im only pasting in one set of numbers for the array.p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecode    var lotteryCheckApp  angular.modulelotteryCheckApp, []     lotteryCheckApp.factoryPowerBall, function          var PowerBall       PowerBall.numArray  [42]     PowerBall.myNumbers  [                      FirstNumber 03,             SecondNumber 07,             ThirdNumber 17,             FourthNumber 21,             FifthNumber 42,             PowerBall 21              ]     return PowerBall   lotteryCheckApp.controllerPowerBallNumbersCtrl,functionscope,PowerBall      scope.powerball  PowerBall     scope.winningStyle  true     scope.powerball.numArray.push21      scope.myCheck  functionsearchNum,numVal           the following code works for a simple input to value check         ifsearchNum  numVal return true         else return false      codepre  pI have a JSFiddle link a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netDivermarvVpyxZ1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netDivermarvVpyxZ1ap  pAgain, thank you all for your patience and responses.p

Negative 92541 pI have created an ActiveX dll object. I am calling the object from JavaScript in the IE browser. The object has a method named run which launches a VB6 application and passes a parameter to it. To create the ActiveX object I have referred to a hrefhttpdotnetslackers.comarticlescsharpwritinganactivexcontrolincsharp.aspx relnofollowthis linka. p  pI am calling this script on click of URL in browser. The problem is that onclick the URL a new application launches every time. Instead, I would like to use IPC inter process communication so that I can check via JavaScript if the application is already launched and pass the parameter to it using IPC else launch and pass parameter to it. The VB6 app will then need to be programmed in such a way that it is capable of accepting parameters. Instead of IPC is there any other method for messagingp  pPlease can you guide me on this topic.. or provide with some reference articleslinkscode samplesp
Negative 92541 pIm trying to build my very first ListView in Android, and for this Im building a custom ListAdapter. So I created a class called NotificationsAdapter which extends the BaseAdapter. Since I want to be able to translate the strings into other languages, I created a stringarray in strings.xmlp  precodeltstringarray namenotificationsstringarraygt     ltitemgtThe first itemltitemgt     ltitemgtThe second itemltitemgt     ltitemgtNumber threeltitemgt     ltitemgtNumero fourltitemgt ltstringarraygt codepre  pNext to dislaying the items in this list, I also want to be able to click every item. This should create an intent to get the user to the next screen always the same with which I have to give a putextra so that I know in the next activity which item the user clicked. Furthermore, I want to put a custom icon next to the list item.p  pIn my Adapter Ive got a constructor in which I load the notificationsstringarray as followsp  precodeint theStringArray  R.array.notificationsstringarray codepre  pThis is however, just the id of the string array. strongSo first question how do I load the whole arraystrongp  pI then need to load the array in the view, which I try to do like sop  precodeOverride public View getViewfinal int position, View convertView, ViewGroup viewGroup      LayoutInflater inflater  LayoutInflater context.getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE     View rowView  inflater.inflateR.layout.listitemnotifications, viewGroup, false     TextView textView  TextView rowView.findViewByIdR.id.textnotification     textView.setTexttheStringArray[position]  codepre  pThis goes horribly wrong, because theStringArray is not a string array at all, but just an int referring to a string array. I guess this is solved with an answer to my first question.p  pFrom this point on however, I wouldnt know how to add an intent which I can give a .putextra dependent on the item on which the user clicks. And lastly, how to give every item his own icon Where should I store this list of icons and how do I map it to the correct itemp  pIf anybody could enlighten me I would be very gratefulp

Negative 92541 pI have a Win32 OpenGL control that I need to embed in our WPF application. It must respond to, and propogate, mouse and keyboard events.p  pIve created a HwndHost derived instance to host the native window and have overridden the WndProc function in this class. To propogate win32 messages to WPF I handle specific mouse messages and map them to WPF events, then use the static InputManager class to raise them. p  pstrongThe problem is, when I go to handle them the mouse coordinates are messed up.strongp  pHeres a sample of the code Im using to raise the eventsp  precodeIntPtr MyHwndHostWndProcIntPtr hwnd, int msg, IntPtr wParam, IntPtr lParam, bool handled    switch msg        case WMLBUTTONDOWN              MouseButtonEventArgs eventArgs  gcnew MouseButtonEventArgs           MousePrimaryDevice,           EnvironmentTickCount,           MouseButtonLeft          eventArgsgtRoutedEvent  UIElementPreviewMouseDownEvent         eventArgsgtSource  this           Raise the WPF event from the specified WPF event source.         InputManagerCurrentgtProcessInputeventArgs          eventArgsgtRoutedEvent  UIElementMouseDownEvent         InputManagerCurrentgtProcessInputeventArgs          CommandManagerInvalidateRequerySuggested          handled  true         return IntPtrZero          break       return HwndHostWndProchwnd, msg, wParam, lParam, handled  codepre  pWhen my WPF event handlers are triggered and I try to retrieve the mouse coordinates e.g. codee.GetPositionIInputElement sendercode I recieve the wrong values and they are always the same values regardless of where the original event occurred within my control.p  pThe values I get seem to be related to the screen location of the WPF window that hosts the application because they change when the window position changes, but they dont correspond to the actual location of the application window either.p  pI think this emmayem have something to do with the internal state of the WPF InputManager, and the fact that the private field codeMouseDevice.inputSourcecode is codenullcode when my events are raised, but my experiments with .net reflection havent yielded any results there.p  pI dont really know what else to try. Keyboard support worked out of the box, its just the mouse location support that I cant get working correctly.p

Negative 92541 pMy question is somewhat related to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13987195searchfunctionwithenterkeyinjapanesequestiona. However, I do not have the luxury to listen for the codesubmitcode event so the answer to that question will not work for me.p  pMy question strongIs it possible in Javascript to detect when the JapaneseChinese suggestion menu is open Or is there another way to distinguish an kbdEnterkbd keypress that is to accept the JapaneseChinese character suggestion from any other kbdEnterkbd keypressstrongp  pThe reason the solution from the other question will not work for my situation is that I am currently overriding the textarea functionality with JavaScript so that an kbdEnterkbd keypress submits the form instead of making a newline.p  pTherefore I want to be able to distinguish between an kbdEnterkbd keypress that is to accept a character suggestion for Japanese or Chinese and for any other kbdEnterkbd keypress I want to submit the form.p

Negative 92541 pI am producing or trying to a directed graph in java made up of codeNodecodes and codeEdgecodes. This graph represents a dependency tree of what I call Modules Modules play some role in my program. Certain modules need to be ran before others within the program and I use a directed graph to represent this. Modules and codeNodecodes know which other modules must come before them. p  pCurrently I take and read a directory and get a ArrayList of Modules and in turn make that into an ArrayList of codeNodecodes. My problem is connecting these codenodecodes with the codenodecode classes codeaddEdge..code function. When I call my function code below codeconnectNodes..code I want to create edge objects between the codenodecodes so that I can traverse the entire tree, going from codenodecodes to codenodecodes using codeedgecodes. It seems the the way in which my codeconnectNodes..code method works I cannot do this. p  pThe problem is that the codeoutEdgecode and codeinEdgecode codeHashSetcode of each codeNodecode object returned from codeconnectNodescode correctly points to codeNodecode with the proper name representing their upper and lower dependencies, but those codeNodecode objects do not have their codeinEdgecode and codeoutEdgecode sets filled to point to the codeNodecode above and below them in the tree. p  pSo it is as if, each end of every edge points to a copy of another Node object with the proper info but the wrong by wrong I mean none edge sets. They should point to the other Node objects in the ArrayList. p  pNode.javap  precodeimport java.util.ArrayList import java.util.HashSet  public class Node      public String name     public HashSetltEdgegt inEdges     public HashSetltEdgegt outEdges     public ArrayListltStringgt deps      public NodeString name, ArrayListltStringgt deps          this.name  name         inEdges  new HashSetltEdgegt         outEdges  new HashSetltEdgegt          this.deps  deps          public Node addEdgeNode node         Edge e  new Edgethis, node         outEdges.adde         node.inEdges.adde         return this          Override     public String toString          return name           Used to copy a given node     public NodeNode inNode              this.name  inNode.name         this.inEdges  HashSetltEdgegtinNode.inEdges.clone         this.outEdges  HashSetltEdgegtinNode.outEdges.clone         this.deps  inNode.deps       codepre  pEdge.javap  precodepublic class Edge      public Node from     public Node to     public EdgeNode from, Node to          this.from  from         this.to  to          Override     public boolean equalsObject obj          Edge e  Edgeobj         return e.from  from ampamp e.to  to       codepre  pThe problem functionp  precodeprivate ArrayListltNodegt connectNodesArrayListltNodegt modNodes      Final output, a directed graph     ArrayListltNodegt dirGraph  new ArrayListltNodegt     For each moduleNode in the argument list     forint i  0 i lt modNodes.size i              Node curNode  modNodes.geti         Get the modules dependencies         ArrayListltStringgt curDepNames  curNode.deps         For each dependency of this module         forint j  0 j lt curDepNames.size j                      String curDep  curDepNames.getj             Node depNode  null             For each moduleNode in the argument list             Find the one that matches this dependency             forint k  0 k lt modNodes.size k                              Node AmodNode  modNodes.getk                 If this modules name is the same as the dependency save it                 and break from the loop                 ifAmodNode.toString.equalscurDep                                      depNode  AmodNode                     break                                            If we didnt find the modules dependency then there is an error              We are missing a dependency             ifdepNode  null                               Throw missing dependency error  Do we stop what were doing                 modCheckStat  Messages.SetConfig.MODULEMISSINGDEP                 return null                          Otherwise connect an edge between the current ModuleNode and its dependency             curNode  curNode.addEdgedepNode                  Add this node and its dependency to the final array         dirGraph.addcurNode          return dirGraph  codepre  pEDIT I think my problem lies in this function meant to clone the array list, it does not take into account the edges pointing to the old Nodes and not the new nodes. p  precodepublic static ArrayListltNodegt cloneListArrayListltNodegt inList      ArrayListltNodegt clonedList  new ArrayListltNodegtinList.size     forNode aNode  inList              clonedList.addnew NodeaNode          return clonedList  codepre

Negative 92541 pThis is more of a code agnostic problem.p  pIn discrete space, I need to draw random points along arbitrary implicit polynomials, of arbitrary dimension and arbitrary degree.p  pI work on it using C, and I have the Eigen library available however I doubt that any kind of solver could be used on any degree. Higher level functions and languages are thus not a solution MATLAB for example or even Python.p  pAnyway, my current naive way is top  ul lidraw a random point in spaceli lidetermine the value of the isofunction for this pointli licreate an adjacency ball of the pointli liof all neighbors, determine the closest to the surfaceli limove the considered point in place of this neighbor. If the point move outside my range, just delete itli lirepeat until the isofunction is nullli ul  pNow, I could see several way to improve. Do not generate a whole adjacency ball each time, but simply draw a line and make a sort of binary search along this line.p  pAnyway, the method is still very similar at its core.p  pon a side note, the isofunction is continuous, however I use some kind of digitization to evaluate whether my point is actually lying on it or notp  pMy problem with this is that it is pretty low for large n 3, and that, more importantly, the points will tend to concentrate on certain parts of the isosurface. I use this to generate datasets to evaluate some algorithms, so even if the distribution is not a problem of prime importance, the ability for me to control the quality of the dataset would be interesting.p  pIs there a better way to distribute random points on an isosurfacep

Negative 92541 pI am trying to stream audio data from disk using OpenALs buffer queueing mechanism. I load and enqueue 4 buffers, start the source playing, and check in a regular intervals to refresh the queue. Everything looks like its going splendidly, up until the first time I try to load data into a recycled buffer I got from alSourceUnqueueBuffers. In this situation, alBufferData always sets ALINVALIDOPERATION, which according to a hrefhttpwww.openal.orgdocumentationopenal1.1specification.pdf relnofollowthe official v1.1 speca, it doesnt seem like it should be able to do.p  pI have searched extensively on Google and StackOverflow, and cant seem to find any reason why this would happen. The closest thing I found was someone with a hrefhttpopenal.996291.n3.nabble.comDetachbufferissuetd5157.html relnofollowa possiblyrelated issuea in an archived forum post, but details are few and responses are null. There was also a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6990701whywouldalsourceunqueuebuffersfailwithinvalidoperationthis SO questiona with slightly different circumstances, but the only answers suggestion does not help.p  pPossibly helpful I know my context and device are configured correctly, because loading small wav files completely into a single buffer and playing them works fine. Through experimentation, Ive also found that queueing 2 buffers, starting the source playing, and immediately loading and enqueueing the other two buffers throws no errors its only when Ive unqueued a processed buffer that I run into trouble.p  pThe relevant codep  precodestatic constexpr int MAXBUFFERCOUNT  4  define alCallfuncCall funcCall SoundyOutportCheckErrorFILE, LINE, funcCall  abort  void0   bool SoundyOutportCheckErrorconst string amppFile, int pLine, const string amppfunc      ALenum tErrCode  alGetError     iftErrCode  0              auto tMsg  alGetStringtErrCode         LogeroTAG ltlt tMsg ltlt  at  ltlt pFile ltlt  ltlt pLine ltlt n                         ltlt tAL call  ltlt pfunc ltlt  failed. ltlt end         return true          return false   void SoundyOutportEnqueueBufferconst float pData, int pFrames      static int called  0     called      ALint tState     alCallalGetSourceimSourceId, ALSOURCETYPE, amptState     iftState  ALSTATIC              Stop       alCallalSourceimSourceId, ALBUFFER, NULL           ALuint tBufId  ALNONE     int tQueuedBuffers  QueuedUpBuffers     int tReady  ProcessedBuffers     iftQueuedBuffers lt MAXBUFFERCOUNT              tBufId  mBufferIds[tQueuedBuffers]          else iftReady gt 0               the fifth time through, this code gets hit         alCallalSourceUnqueueBuffersmSourceId, 1, amptBufId           debug code make sure these values go down by one         tQueuedBuffers  QueuedUpBuffers         tReady  ProcessedBuffers          else              return  no update needed yet.           void tConverted  convertpData, pFrames       the fifth time through, we get ALINVALIDOPERATION, and call abort     alCallalBufferDatatBufId, mFormat, tConverted, pFrames  mBitdepth8, mSampleRate      alCallalSourceQueueBuffersmSourceId, 1, ampmBufferId     ifmBitdepth  BITDEPTH8              delete uint8ttConverted          else  ifmBitdepth  BITDEPTH16              delete uint16ttConverted        void SoundyOutportPlayBufferedStream      ifStreamingMode  QueuedUpBuffers              LogwroTAG ltlt Attempted to play an unbuffered stream ltlt end         return           alCallalSourceimSourceId, ALLOOPING, ALFALSE  never loop streams     alCallalSourcePlaymSourceId   int SoundyOutportQueuedUpBuffers      int tCount  0     alCallalGetSourceimSourceId, ALBUFFERSQUEUED, amptCount     return tCount   int SoundyOutportProcessedBuffers      int tCount  0     alCallalGetSourceimSourceId, ALBUFFERSPROCESSED, amptCount     return tCount   void SoundyOutportStop      ifPlaying              alCallalSourceStopmSourceId           int tBuffers     alCallalGetSourceimSourceId, ALBUFFERSQUEUED, amptBuffers     iftBuffers              ALuint tDummy[tBuffers]         alCallalSourceUnqueueBuffersmSourceId, tBuffers, tDummy          alCallalSourceimSourceId, ALBUFFER, ALNONE   bool SoundyOutportPlaying      ALint tPlaying     alCallalGetSourceimSourceId, ALSOURCESTATE, amptPlaying     return tPlaying  ALPLAYING   bool SoundyOutportStreamingMode      ALint tState     alCallalGetSourceimSourceId, ALSOURCETYPE, amptState     return tState  ALSTREAMING   bool SoundyOutportStaticMode      ALint tState     alCallalGetSourceimSourceId, ALSOURCETYPE, amptState     return tState  ALSTATIC  codepre  pAnd heres an annotated screen cap of what I see in my debugger when I hit the errorp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXAC9Z.png altAnnotated view of debugger contentsp  pIve tried a bunch of little tweaks and variations, and the result is always the same.

Negative 92541 pIm using Spritebuilder to make my game, and CCScrollView usually saves me quite a bit of time. Im trying to implement the scroll view much in the same way as the home screen on an iphone uses the UIScrollView. I want the page indicators to be visible and change as you scroll through the pages the little white dots for iOS 7. p  pIn Spritebuilder I set up the CCScrollView as a child of a CCNode. Then I set the content node to another one of my ccbi files, codeEasyPackpage1code. When I run my project, everything works pretty well. strongI currently have a content node that is large enough so that it has three different pages, so if I scroll to the right it locks onto the next page, scroll to the right again, it locks onto the next page. The only problem is that the page indicators are nonexistentstrong. How can I get these page indicatorsp  pIf someone knows the solution for doing this using purely code, that would also be greatly appreciated. Cocos2d v3 still has very little documentation and I havent been able to find much on how to use CCScrollView, since it looks like CCScrollLayer is deprecated in v3. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfGcG2.png altenter image description herep  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 92541 pIs it possible to send data from an android Activity to adb  I want to start an activity through ADB and pass it some data, perform an operation, then read the result.  What is the best way to do this p  pFor example adb.exe shell am start n com.examplecom.example.Adder ei operand1 10 ei operand2 20 This adds 10  20 .. and stores the total 30. How do I fetch that value p  pThese suggestions from my research are not an option 1. write to a file then read it from adb using pull [the phone my not have an SD card, and there is a bug with android 4.3 that means runas command doesnt work] 2. opening a socket and sending data through that [I dont want to depend on a network]p  pUPDATE  so I have been able to do something through adb forward as Chris suggested. I first start the adb forward adb forward tcp10000 tcp10000p  pThen on my android application.. I create a server socket and block at serverSocket.accept Then the client connects.. and then you can send data back and forth as you would with TCPIP socket.p  pI just have one issue now, which is not documented in ADB once the forward is setup, the client seems to connect to the server socket even if it is not setup yet on the android side.  Why is that the case, is it possible to detect that the serverSocket is not setup yet.. once my clientSocket connects to this shadow socket p

For example, in a table codepostscode with the fields codepostid, authorid, timestampcode I know how to do...p  precodemysqlquerySELECT  FROM posts ORDER BY timestamp codepre  pBut is there a way to have a certain users posts say, codeauthorid  5code show up at the top of the results, and then sort by timestamp after that  To be clear I DONT want to sort by codeauthoridcode, I just want to isolate the posts where codeauthoridcode is 5 specifically, and then sort by codetimestampcode for everything else.p  pIs there a way to do that  Ive tried,p  precodemysqlquerySELECT  FROM posts ORDER BY authorid  5, timestamp codepre  p...but it doesnt seem to work.p

We need this problem to be resolved.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI have more information in case it is useful for google folks. The problem only occurs when using chrome and only if user is already logged into google before hitting the Integrate with Google button to install from the listing. The problem doesnt occur in firefox. The problem also doesnt occur in chrome if the user is not logged in to google when hitting Integrate with Google button such that the user will then be asked to log in before being taken to the data access and terms dialog.p  pFurther when the blank page is being displayed there is a dialog being displayed under it. That says Get ready to install lt app name  needs your permission in order to start installing. and has two buttons Cancel and Continue. Cancel will dismiss this dialog, and Continue will not dismiss the dialog but keeps bringing up the blank page to the front. In either case, unless you dismiss the the blank page you dont get the dialog that says app has been added. [On further testing, the Get ready to install dialog gets popped up immedately after hitting Integrate with Google. It is already there underneath the data access and terms of use dialog.]p  pLastly, I see that someone else has reported a similar issuep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21851369chromewebstoreappinstallredirectstoablankpageChrome Web Store app install redirects to a blank pageap  pRegards, LTp

Negative 92541 pTo preface this is homework and Im not looking for answers, just a little direction because I cant make it to the lab tutor for help.

So that doesnt work. I know how to do it if I could change my class definition, but I cant. I guess my intention was for this to refer to time3, but it refers to the left hand side of the equation.p  pHow can I make the result equal time3 in my add functions without changing the structure of my classp  pI couldnt find any resources that show the proper way to handle this situation, but if you have any Id be happy read through them.p

Which brought me to the following ideap  h3 2 YOU get outh3  pI made a separate container element for the orange boxes and put it outside of the timeline, gave it an absolute position and placed it on top of the timeline so it stays there no matter if the user is scrolling the timeline. Results No difference in appearance and scrolling to the left and right works perfect because I dont have to set the left position of the orange boxes. strongBUT...strong This solution may work for scrolling horizontally, but when scrolling vertically, the orange boxes have no clue about the vertical position of the timeline, so disadvantages of this solution arep  ul liThe vertical scroll position of the orange boxes has to be set with javascript.li liScrolling vertically is a bit laggy on IE but smoother and less annoying than first solution.li liminor The height of both containers has to be the same, which means setting the height when needed has to be done twice.li ul  pI would appreciate your helpp

For examplep  precodewhile True  print Doing whatever I feel like  userinput  rawinput  if userinput  q     break codepre  pSo this keeps printing until the user enters q, but it prompts the user for input each iteration. How can I avoid thisp
Negative 92541 pI am inserting unique names into a database table that have been submitted by users as their username. p  pWhen a name is submitted via a form, my ColdFusion code checks the database to see if that name already exists. If it does exist then it makes it the username unique by adding a sequential number  to it.p  pMy issue is that while checking the database for a name conflict is easy enough, I also dont want the name to conflict with the name of any folder, .cfm file, or .html file in my site. p  pAt the moment I am using a simple codeListFindNoCasefolder1,folder2,folderN, usernamecode function to check for conflicts but this is done manually. Whenever I add a new file or folder to the site I have to add it to this list. Its not a good way to do it.p  pHow can I get a list of all the contents in my site and make it into a delimited list and then do the codeListFindNoCasecode function to check if the username is in that list of contents Is this even a pragmatic way to go about itp

Negative 92541 pI have a class that works as a layer above the database layer for easy database access and it works very fine. But now I would like all methods that read from the database being able to be accessed asynchronously without any risk of doing something dangerous. So I thought that if I implement an interface with only the read methods I could refer to that interface instead of the normal class when working from an async thread.p  pIs there any better but hopefully similar way to make this happenp  pHeres an example of how far Ive tried, but without successp  precode My two interfaces.  The UserCoreManager class is the layer that works with the database  layer for the users table.  but the IUserCoreManagerAsync only reference the async friendly methods.  public interface IUserCoreManagerAsync      User GetData   public interface ICoreAsync      IUserCoreManagerAsync User  get   codepre  pSo far, so good. By refering to the User in the ICoreAsync interface I would theoretically only be able to Get data and not Save anyp  pHeres what my actual classes implementing the interfaces looks likep  precodepublic class UserCoreManager  IUserCoreManagerAsync      public User GetData              ...           public User SetData              ...        public partial class Core  ICoreAsync      private UserCoreManager user     public UserCoreManager User  lt This is the tricky part              get                      return user                  protected set                      user  UserCoreManagervalue                codepre  pAs you can see, The UserCoreManager has a SetData method, so when working with it not refering too the interface it will not be thread safe for me. But as you also can see, I dont implement the interface property returning a IUserCoreManagerAsync, but I was sort of hoping that the UserCoreManager property would do the trick.p  pHow would you do this My goal is to achieve something like this when working with these classesp  precodepublic void DoSomeAsyncWorkICoreAsync core      var myData  core.User.GetData   public void DoSomeWorkCore core      core.User.SetDatasome data  codepre  pIn this way I have the actual same object, but depending on which methods I give it to and how i cast it, they can be forced to work with them thread safe or not.p

Negative 92541 pIn most programming languages, codeccode is a character and codeccode is a string of length 1. But Coq according to its standard ascii and string library uses codeccode as the notation for both, which requires constant use of codeOpen Scopecode to clarify which one is being referred to. How can you avoid this and designate characters in the usual way, with single quotes It would be nice if there is a solution that only partially overrides the standard library, changing the notation but recycling the rest.p

Negative 92541 pI am running in to an issue on a site where Ive got 3 different tabs within a page, and they all have the same menu at the top of it, that includes checkboxes. The intent of it is to check off certain filters for a search. The checkboxes are styled to look more like radio buttons, but function as a normal checkbox.p  pOn the first tab, it works as intended  checking it will display the checked image. When someone chooses another tab, it hides the contents of the currently active tab, and displays the contents of the selected tab. Any of the checkboxes in the other tabs, though, end up checking the box in the first tab, which I can see if I click back over to the first one. The checkbox in the other tab I actually clicked, though, looks unchecked.p  pIve tried to target very specifically with the CSS, and no matter how long or specific I make the selectors, I cant get the checked rules to apply. Everything else works fine  I can remove the stylings and do other things to the checkboxes in the other tabs. Just unable to get the checked state to apply. Does anyone know what Im doing wrong Heres some code for examplep  pHTML  portion of the first tabs checklist including checkboxesp  precode                    ltdiv idactivedeals classgt

Negative 92541 pI have external closed library that can compile with armv7s etc only. when I try to compile against simulator obviously its not running and display some errors. I dont want to insert this library to my code unless I can configure Xcode to use this library only when i test with a device. unfortunately, i tried to do it with cocoapods with no success and i wonder if there any way to do itp

Negative 92541 pI am on a pretty locked down environment where I only have powershell v1.0 available. I am trying to get internal Sharepoint data downloaded programmatically. I cannot do this with an ADODB Connection since the server does not have the appropriate driver for ADODB Connections.p  pTherefore, I want to make an HTTP Request for the data. However, so far my research indicates that powershell v1.0 does not have the ability to make such calls although later versions do, they are not available to me.p  pI cannot use VBScript to accomplish this either as it is not available on the server.p  pIs there some way of making HTTP Requests using powershell v1.0, or is there another recommended way of getting this sharepoint datap
Negative 92541 pSimilar question to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17227855tabhostwithfragmentsandfragmentactivityTabHost with Fragments and FragmentActivitya.p  pI have an Android application that has been set at API level 10 for years.

Negative 92541 pHi guys Happy new year btw    Im giving a try to Node.js and Express.js, and, im facing some difficulties with the processing of several requests. p  pHeres the problem  I need to retrieve data from an external website. To do so, I have to be logged in and I have a fakezombie account available. What I am trying to do is to first send a POST request with my username and password, and then, sending a GET request to access a specific content. The problem is that, even if the POST request is successfully executed, when Im doing the GET request, I am no longer logged in.  I was doing the same thing with the Gem Mechanize in Ruby but, it should probably do some implicit stuff that made the whole process work.  p  pTo make requests, I am using the request module a hrefhttpsgithub.comrequestrequest relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrequestrequesta. And, here is the code p  precodevar zombie  requirerequest.defaults   headers  connection keepalive ,   pool maxSockets 1,   var connect  functionreq, res, next   zombie.post     url target.com,     form        user zombie,       pass password   , functionerr, response, body     req.connected  true     next      var information  functionreq, res, next   ifreq.connected     zombie.get       url  target.com,       qs          page targetPage,         search req.params.search     , functionerr, response, body       res.sendbody          codepre  pAnd, from a controller, Im trying to connect, then to access information. p  precodevar router  requireexpress.Router var zombie  require...middlewareZombie router.getsearchsearch, zombie.connect, zombie.information codepre

What I need to find is the area containted in the graph in number of open or unfilled units.p  h3Solution Pt.1h3  pTo go about this I made an algorithm to calculate all the peaks in the array.p  pThis returns  code[5, 7, 3, 12]code as well as another list with the indices of each entry, code[0,3,5,7]codep  pTo us, there are only three important peaks to find the area. The code5code, the code7code, and the code12code. We can then break it down like this.p  pThe amount of open area in between the 5 and 7 is general rulep  pcode[Index Of Larger]  [Index Of Smaller]  [1][SmallerValue]  [Values Of All In BW]codep  pSo the area of the first section would be code25  43code or code107code or code3code. THis makes sense because if you look at the graph you see there is an empty L shaped section that you could fit 3 units of say, water in without it overflowing.  If you repeat this with the second section you get its correct area as well.p  h2My issue is developing an algorithm to go from codeALL PEAKScode to the codeIMPORTANT PEAKScode.h2  h2Misleadingh2  pIn this case it is extremely easy to see how that could be done. You simply write an algo to find that the code3code is smaller than the code7code and the code12code so get rid of it and return a refined version of the peaks.p  pHowever it is not always that simple.p  h3More Difficult Exampleh3  pI have an arrayp  pcode[5, 4, 3, 7, 2, 3, 1, 12, 9, 10, 5, 3, 6, 8, 5, 6, 4, 7, 6, 9, 4, 11, 11, 4, 1, 2, 1]codep  pRunning it through a basic custom peak finding algorithm codeONcode It returnsp  pcode[5, 7, 3, 12, 10, 8, 6, 7, 9, 11, 11, 4, 2]codep  pIn this example, we see the same problem in the first part of this question, however, after the code12code in this peak list, a human can easily see that the next most important peak to look at are the two code11scode, the code4code, and code2code. So I need a way to go fromp  pcode[5, 7, 3, 12, 10, 8, 6, 7, 9, 11, 11, 4, 2]codep  pTop  pcode[5, 7, 12, 11, 11, 4, 2]codep  pThe above array is a list of the important peaks that are necessary to find the area and again visualize the open blocks as if theyd contain water or something so that they are limited to the lowest immediate peak before overflowing.p  pTo better visualize this more full, second example I have a picture of the graph and all of its peaks and data points a hrefhttppostimg.orgimagemwx7dga7b relnofollowherea.p  pThank you.p

Negative 92541 pOkay so I have come here to ask this after quite a few attempts.p  pstrongMy Aimstrongp  ol lipI am building a Phonegap app for android which uses quite a large number of JSON files. The contents of the JSON files also changes quite frequently. Currently, I am providing the JSON files in the app itself. But since the changes are frequent, I update it on PlayStore and my users have to update it after every few days.pli lipTo solve this issue, I want to host the JSON online so that my app can update the JSON without app update  I can use localStorage, etc. but thats not the real issue.pli lipI want to use Parse.com s backend to store the JSON files because of the ease they provide to update the data. I wrote a codepli ol  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecode.getJSONmyurl.parseapp.comfile.json, functionjson       do something here  codepre  pI got the error codeCross Origin Request Blockedcode. So I read about it and online they say that you have to enable CORS on your server before you can make such access. p  pI dont know any way of enabling it on Parse. p  pI also tried using JSONP plugin a hrefhttpsgithub.comjaubourgjqueryjsonp relnofollowSee here which onea but it always went to the codeerrorcode state instead of codesuccesscode. I read it online and they say my site is not returning a correct JSONWhat. What is a correct JSON It may here be noted that I have not configured my backend to handle the callback as Parse does not provide this I guess . p  pThen also, I went to online tools a hrefhttpmyjson.com relnofollowlike thisa which allow hosting JSON with CORS enabled backend. But the main problem is that strongtheystrong provide me URL to the JSON and I kind of dont like it because logic of my code requires to use some custom names and numbers. Also, updating it is a little difficult.p  pI have not worked with any other backend before. p  pCan anyone help me out. p  pstrongTLDRstrongp  pI am looking for a backend that 1. Can host my JSON files and enable CORS. 2. Allows easy updating of the JSON files.  3. Be free. p  pThanks. p

Negative 92541 pI have done a few searches on the web for the answer on this one and over SO, but could not find much info for my specific scenario.p  pI am using Suiz Matrix CMS and we need to display conditional data according to user group. The CMS will accept GET and POST variables. But instead of asking user to create the variables everytime they access the site like clicking on a button we want it to be stored in a cookie and then pulled out and sent back to the CMS as a GETPOST variable. Meaning the user only clicks on the button once and does not get asked for this repeatedly.p  pI just want to know if this is even possible I would like to explore if HTML5 local storage does this also which i can assume does a much better job than cookies but the CMS we are using does not have an option for using local storage yet, only GET or POST variables.p

It will continue to try every possible route through these two loops. This means the amount of work doubles with each additional character.

It basically cycles through colours using some nifty java. p  pWhen I move the position of the script itself inside the page, I can get it to work, but between it and the menu, both seem to be mutually exclusive. Ive tried specifying transparent for the background properties in parts of the menus code, but to no avail.

I even spent a while trying things with the zindex of the menu properties but cant seem to change any of those parameters without disabling the functionality of the menu itself. p  pId usually just throw myself at it until I got it to work but Ive run out of ideas.

Not positive if it has to do with a firewall on the ChromeOS device This particular app runs perfectly otherwise in ChromeOS, just not the ability to find the label printer and unfortunately cannot define a printer IP in this app manually.

Negative 92541 pI have written firmware for many microcontrollers, like 8051, AVR, and ARM. So I have a clear idea what a firmware is.p  pRecently when I was updating my Linux distro, I noticed that there are many firmware related packages being updated, e.g. iwl3160firmware, and iwl1000firmware. They have files with .fw extension.p  pIf a firmware is a piece of code, that is burnt into the nonvolatile memory of an embedded controller, then what are these .fw files doingp  pIs it that they are actually burnt into the respective devices nonvolatile memory at the time of a system update, or they are dynamically loaded into the devices volatile program memory every time the device is switched on Or are they just vendor specific proprietary codes which are used by the kernel to access the devicep  pAn answer with a specific example, say iwl3160firmware, would be appreciated.p

Anyone can tell whats wrong Im working in Django 1.8 and the whole code is a hrefhttpsgithub.comShubhamRathiDjangoecommerceblobmasteraccountssignals.py relnofollowherea.p  pGist about the code This code is part of an ecommerce site which users stripe as its payment gateway. Intent is, every time user logs in, we create a new stripe id or return an existing one. p  pIs it because this function is not in models.py This is written to a file signals.py and Im not quite sure how Django should understand to call getcreatestripe from a signal call in this file. Is it sop  precodeimport stripe from django.conf import settings from django.contrib.auth.signals import userloggedin from .models import UserStripe  stripe.apikey  settings.STRIPESECRETKEY   def getcreatestripesender, user, args, kwargs     newuserstripe, created  UserStripe.objects.getorcreateuseruser     print hello     if created         customer  stripe.Customer.create             email  struser.email                  print customer         newuserstripe.stripeid  customer.id         newuserstripe.save  userloggedingetcreatestripe codepre
Negative 92541 pIm currently having a problem that I cannot seem to find an answer for. In my web api 2 project, we use the post request to add a resource to the database. However, during serialization of the JSON to Model, im running into a problem with some of the models properties that are actually abstract. Let me illustratep  pClassesp  precodepublic class Person      public string Name get set     public virtual Address Address get set    public abstract class Address       public int Id get set   public class ConcreteAddressType1  Address      public string Street get set   public class ConcreteAddressType2  Address      public string POBox get set  codepre  pThe ApiController Action looks like thisp  precode[HttpPost] public async TaskltIHttpActionResultgt Post[FromBody]Person person       Validate and save to Database     return person        codepre  pCurrently outofthebox this property Address is always null, which makes sense, since it is abstract an must be either one of the two concrete instances which the serializer cannot decide on its own.  So when deserializing the request body to an instance of Person, I need to somehow check the Addressfield of the passed in JsonXML and depending on that, decide which concrete class it has to be. The fields for the two Addresssuperclasses are different enough that I can decide which concrete class it has to be.p  pSo I have tried making custom model binders, for both the Person and Address, but it doesnt feel good, I just want to know if there is a way to use the regular Web Api ModelBinder for Person which works perfectly, just use a different custom binder for one of its properties.p  pI found something in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20408771jsonnetabstractderivedclassdeserializationwithwebapi2JSON.NET Abstract  Derived Class Deserialization with WebAPI 2a, however, I need a solution without the client type parameter. I also found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17277578webapimodelbindingandpolymorphicinheritenceWeb Api Model Binding and Polymorphic Inheritencea which looks really close to how I see it, but this is for the entire class in the parameter, not one of its properties.p  pLastly, I found I can do something like this with a custom model binderp  precode[HttpPost] public async TaskltIHttpActionResultgt Post[FromBody]Person person, [ModelBindertypeofAdresModelBinder]Address address      The custom modelbinder has bound address to the correct concrete class     person.Address  address       Validate and save to Database     return person        codepre  pBut Id like to just have the one input parameter and the entire Person object for readability reasons and separate binding and combining seems errorprone and not in the Controlleractionss scope.p  pThanksp

Negative 92541 pthe problem is to fill Java object fields both of java standart typesLong, Boolean, etc. and collections of those from a codeMapltString, ListltStringgtgtcode. p  pInspecting target objects fields via reflecton one can see which field is a codeCollectioncode and which is not. In second case if Map element has a single value one can use something like BeanUtils to set such fieldsp  precodeBeanUtils.setPropertybean, name, stringList.get0 codepre  pBut in first case I dont have idea how to determine a type of collectionexcept of sequentially checking if it is List, Set, Map and type of its elements. Simplep  precodeBeanUtils.setPropertybean, name, stringList codepre  pwill be valid only if target field type is a codeListltStringgtcode.p  pBut the Jackson library succesfully solves the same problem. For example, consider classp  precodepublic static class TestObject      private int integerField     private String stringField     private ListltStringgt stringList     private ListltIntegergt intList      ...getters...setters...  codepre  pNow it can be filled with content using Jackson libraryp  precode    ObjectMapper mapper  new ObjectMapper     TestObject obj  mapper.readValue              stringField stringValue,               integerField 42,               stringList[1, 2, 3],              intList[3, 2, 1]              , TestObject.class codepre  pWorks perfect. So my question is there way to use a library such Jackson for solving my problemp  pThanks.p

I didnt expect it to move them by 300 pixels. p  pWhen passed to codetraingulatePointscode, the results get even stranger  Ive measured the distance between three points in real life with a ruler, and calculated the distance between pixels on each picture. Because this time the points were on a pretty flat plane, these two lengths pixel and real matched, as in ABBC in both cases was around 49. However, codetriangulatePointscode gives me results off the rails, with ABBC being 32 or 42. p  pThis is my codep  precodedouble pointsBok[2]   bokList[j].toFloatxBok2, bokList[j1].toFloatyBok2  cvMat imgPointsBokProper  cvMat1,1, CV64FC2, pointsBok  double pointsTyl[2]   tylList[j].toFloatxTyl2, tylList[j1].toFloatyTyl2  cvMat imgPointsTyl  cvMat2,1, CV64FC1, pointsTyl cvMat imgPointsTylProper  cvMat1,1, CV64FC2, pointsTyl  cvundistortPointsimgPointsBokProper, imgPointsBokProper,        intrinsicOne, distCoeffsOne, R1, P1 cvundistortPointsimgPointsTylProper, imgPointsTylProper,        intrinsicTwo, distCoeffsTwo, R2, P2  cvtriangulatePointsP1, P2, imgWutBok, imgWutTyl, point4D  double wResult  point4D.atltdoublegt3,0 double realX  point4D.atltdoublegt0,0wResult double realY  point4D.atltdoublegt1,0wResult double realZ  point4D.atltdoublegt2,0wResult codepre  pThe angles between points are kinda sorta good but usually notp  precode7,16816    168,389 4,44275 vs 5,85232    170,422 3,72561 degrees 8,44743    166,835 4,71715 vs 12,4064    158,132 9,46158 9,34182    165,388 5,26994 vs 19,0785    150,883 10,0389 codepre  pIve tried to use codeundistortcode on the entire frame, but got results just as odd.

Negative 92541 pIm almost loosing my mind here with a problem that I have, so I will appreciate any help you guys can provide me. I deployed a Bitnami LAMP instance from the Amazon templates that they provide and Im using it to run my web site PHP based, now as part of the web site there is a contact us page that is using the PHP function mail.p  pMy problem is that when I try to use that from the web from my web server it doesnt work but when I run the exact same code from the local host  just by SSHing to the machine and running the code it does work.p  pI saw plenty of articles about it and it seems like it is something to do with the configurations on the server itself but Im not sure what, the most interesting and I think the one that makes sense is one that tells me to enable the httpdsendmail in the SELinux configuration, but then the problem is that when I try that Im getting an error saying that SELinux is disabled and I dont know how to enable it.p  pThe code that Im using is the followingp  precodeifmailMYMAILgmail.com, TEST, TESTING FROM SERVER, FromMYMAILgmail.com       reportEmail Successfully Sent                 else                  reportEmail Sent Failed Try Again             ifissetreport           echoltscriptgtalert.report.ltscriptgt     codepre  pPlease please help  p  pThanks in advance to everyone p

Negative 92541 pIn Angularjs 1 it is possible to sort and filter the following wayp  precodeltul ngrepeatfriend in friends  filterquery  orderBy name gt    ltligtfriend.nameltligt ltulgt codepre  pBut I could not find any examples of how to do this in Angularjs 2.0.

Negative 92541 pThis is what noticed When it starts, the data item index 0, 1, ..., 5 are displayed in the view. And saw the onCreateViewHolder and onBindViewHolder got called for them. Then scroll out the top item, and saw the the onCreateViewHolder and onBindViewHolder got called for the index 6. Then scroll down to bring back the item index 0 into view. Since it was not recycled so no onBindViewHolder is called.   p  pThis is by design, but having a case would like the onBindViewHolder to be called.p  pWhen item index 0 is out the view, and clicking on any item in the view would like to change the item index 0s data. When it is scroll back into the view would like to show the datas change. But since its onBindView is not called, the data change of this row is not updated in UI.p  pIt could call p  precodenotifyDataSetChanged  codepre  pafter the data change to force redraw the list. But the result is not good because there is image on the view item and shows flickering.p  ptried use LayoutManager to get whatever is the view to force update. The problem is when is best time to know that index 0 is showing up in the LayoutManagers children viewp  pAny suggestion Thanksp
