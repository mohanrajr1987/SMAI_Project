Negative 83700 pIm experiencing a memory leak when using WMI from Delphi 7 to query a remote pc. The memory leak only occurs on Windows 2003 and Windows XP 64. Windows 2000 is fine, and so is Windows 2008. Im wondering if anyone has experienced a similar problem.p  pThe fact that the leak only occurs in certain versions of Windows implies that it might be a Windows issue, but Ive been searching the web and havent been able to locate a hotfix to resolve the issue. Also, it might be a Delphi issue, since a program with similar functionality in C doesnt seem to have this leak. The latter fact has led me to believe that there might be another, better, way to get the information I need in Delphi without getting a memory leak.p  pIve included the source to a small program to expose the memory leak below. If the line codesObject.Pathcode below the code Leak code comment is executed, the memory leak occurs. If I comment it out, theres no leak. Obviously, in the real program, I do something useful with the result of the codesObject.Pathcode method call .p  pWith a little quick n dirty Windows Task Manager profiling on my machine, I found the followingp  pre                        Before  N100  N500  N1000 With sObject.Path     3.7M    7.9M   18.2M  31.2M Without sObject.Path  3.7M    5.3M    5.4M   5.3M pre  pI guess my question is has anyone else encountered this problem If so, is it indeed a Windows issue, and is there a hotfix Or more likely is my Delphi code broken, and is there a better way to get the information I needp  pYoull notice on several occasions, codenilcode is assigned to objects, contrary to the Delphi spirit...

Negative 83700 pIm trying to get my head around how type inference is implemented. In particularly, I dont quite see wherewhy the heavy lifting of unification comes into play.p  pIll give an example in pseudo C to help clarifyp  pThe naive way to do it would be something like thisp  pSuppose you parse your program into an expression tree such that it can be executed withp  precodeinterface IEnvironment      object lookupstring name   interface IExpression       Evaluate this program in this environment     object EvaluateIEnvironment e  codepre  pSo something like Multiplication might be implemented withp  precodeclass Multiply  IExpression      IExpression lhs     IExpression rhs      etc.     public object EvaluateIEnvironment e               assume for the moment C has polymorphic multiplication         return lhs.Evaluatee  rhs.Evaluatee       codepre  pThen to implement type inference, you could just do something likep  precodeinterface ITypeEnvironment      Type getTypestring name   interface IExpression      as before     object EvaluateIEnvironment e      infer type     Type inferTypeITypeEnvironment typeEnvironment  codepre  pThen Multiplications type inference might just be something likep  precodeclass Multiply  IExpression      IExpression lhs     IExpression rhs       ...      public Type inferTypeITypeEnvironment typeEnvironment              Type lhsType  lhs.inferTypetypeEnvironment         Type rhsType  rhs.inferTypetypeEnvironment         iflhsType  rhsType              throw new Exceptionlhs and rhs types do not match           you could also check here that lhsrhs are one of doubleintfloat etc.         return lhsType       codepre  plhs and rhs might be simple constants, or variables which are looked up in the environmentp  precodeclass Constant  IExpression      object value     public Type inferTypeITypeEnvironment typeEnvironment              return value.GetType  The type of the value          public object EvaluateIEnvironment environment              return value        class Variable  IExpression      string name     public Type inferTypeITypeEnvironment typeEnvironment              return typeEnvironment.getTypename          public object EvaluateIEnvironment environment              return environment.lookupname       codepre  pBut nowhere in this do we end up with the need for a unification algorithm.p  pSo, clearly, my example is not complex enough. Does it need higher order functions Do we need parametric polymorphismp  pWhat is the simplest possible example where unification is actually needed to correctly infer the type of an expression.p  pAn example in Scheme would be ideal i.e. an example of a very small Scheme program where you require unification to correctly infer the type of the sexpression.p

Negative 83700 pSo I have this idea and I think its basically impossible to implement in C... but I want to ask. I read through chapter 15 of Stroustrup and didnt get my answer, and I dont think the billion other questions about inheritance diamonds answer this one, so Im asking here.p  pThe question is, what happens when you inherit from two base classes which share a common base class themselves, but only one of the two inherits from it virtually. For examplep  precodeclass CommonBase  ...   class BaseA  CommonBase  ...   class BaseB  virtual CommonBase  ...   class Derived  BaseA, BaseB  ...  codepre  pThe reason I think I want to do this is because Im trying to extend an existing library without having to recompile the whole library dont want to open that can of worms. There already exists a chain of inheritance that I would like to modify. Basically something like this excuse the ascii artp  precode    LibBase                                     MyBase                                LibDerived                                             MyDerived                LibDerived2                                             MyDerived2                LibDerived3                                             MyDerived3                LibConcrete                                MyConcrete codepre  pGet the picture I want an object of each of codeMycode classes to embeem an object of the class they are essentially replacing, but I want the next class in the inheritence diagram to use the overridden method implementation from codeMycode base class, but all the other methods from the librarys classes. The library classes do not inherit virtually so its like thisp  precodeclass LibDerived  LibBase codepre  pBut if I make my class inherit virtually p  precodeclass MyBase  virtual LibBase  class MyDerived virtual MyBase, virtual LibDerived  codepre  pSince codeMyDerivedcode will have a vtable, and codeMyBasecode will have a vtable, will there be only one codeLibBasecode object p  pI hope this question is clear enough.p

Negative 83700 pI want to use GenerationType.IDENTITY for primary keys in my production MySQL system. But for local development and testing, Id like to use HSQLDB. The problem is that HSQLDB doesnt support GenerationType.IDENTITY at least with Eclipselink.

Negative 83700 pI have an application that runs in fullscreen mode and has been working fine.  Now I need to add a simple, undecorated dialog and Im running into trouble.  If I run the application strongmaximizedstrong but not in fullscreen, the dialog displays and functions as expected.  When I switch back to fullscreen, the dialog will not display.p  pThe dialog extends JDialog and only contains a JSlider and a couple of buttons.  It is undecorated and strongnot modalstrong.  I disabled modality for testing purposes  it was a pain to force exit the app every time the dialog blocked input.  Im entering full screen mode using codesetFullScreenWindowcode, passing in the main JFrame for the app.  It doesnt make a difference if I set that very JFrame as the owner of the JDialog or not.  Nor does it seem to help if I call codetoFrontcode on the dialog.p  pThe dialog seems to be active  especially since it blocks input if I make it modal  but just not showing or being hidden.

Negative 83700 pI am attempting to capture a very large image that was made dynamically within the Flash Player the size of the image is 2400px by 12,000px and am running into some very serious issues... Let me run down how the image gets to that size in the first placep  pUser adds elements to a canvas and then when the user is finished the canvas scales up to 2400px wide and 12,000px tall. The problem arises when I attempt to save the image to the hard drive. Now, I dont know if this will affect the recommended fix, but the rendered image wont be saved on the hard drive, it will be sent to a server. I know about the 4050px limit in Flash Player and was thinking I could get around that by clipping the images with the ImageSnapshot.captureBitmapData method and keeping the required Rectangle variable below 4000px then repeat that down the large image until it reaches the end where the final images will be pieced together at a later time. However... As i mentioned the error comes when it reaches the fileReference.savepngImage method... Has anyone else done something like thisp

Negative 83700 pIs it ok from your realworldexperience to define service contract with one method which will accept some object as a form of request and return some other object as a result of that request. What I mean is instead of having method for creating, deleting, editing and searching customers I would have these activities encapsulated within DataContracts and what service would do after receiving such DataContract would be take some action accordingly. But service interface would be simple as thatp  precodeinterface ISomeService    IMessageResult ProcessIMessageRequest msg  codepre  pSo IMessageRequest would have filed named OperationType  OperationTypes.CreateCustomer and rest of fields would provide enough information for the service that it could create Customer object or record in database or whatever. And IMessageResult could have field with some code for indication that customer was created or not.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve by such design is an ability to easy delegate IMessageRequest to other internal services that client side wouldnt even know about. Another benefit I see is that if we  will have to add some operation on customers we only provide additional DataContract for this operation and dont have to change anything on service interface side I want to avoid this at all costs, I mean not new operations but changing service interface p  pSo, what do you think Is it good way of handling complicated business processes What are pitfals, what could be better.p  pIf I duplicated some other thread and there are some answers to my question please provide me with links because I didnt find them.p

Negative 83700 pI am using Selenium to test out a web site. The web site contains a date field, which when clicked, opens a popup from wherein I can choose the date.p  pMy issue is that I wish to select a particular date using the Selenium IDE or Selenese. I have tried various methods, but have not been able to get a correct solution or been able to resolve it, except by manually specifying a date to the field in Selenese script. I am using Java to implement the test case.p  pAn example could be checked by going to any airlines site and clicking on the date field for departure. The popup which comes up, I wish to capture a date on that. This could be a future date or the present date.p
Negative 83700 pI have a somewhat complex custom user control, created in C .NET, which is essentially a tree structure. The control , ctlGroup, contains a list of fields which are also custom user controls  ctlFields and a list of child groups. The datalist containing the child groups creates new instances of the same ctlGroup control, because each of the children can have a list of fields and a list of children, and so on. Whew.p  pThe number of children each group can have is finite, and each child group is an entry in a database, so infinite recursion is not possible. The controls are created fine, and displayed fine, until a postback occurs. I have been able to persist all the data pertaining to each dynamically created control pretty well on post back, with one exception. The part I am having trouble with is maintaining the visibility of certain panels on the controls through postback. Each child group has a button that expands and collapses part of the body. I can collapse this portion once, but as soon as I click the button again i.e. cause a postback, the control is persisted and its previous visibility setting is lost. p  pI seem to be struggling with coming up with a way to store this information. I tried saving the state of the visibility in the viewstate, but it seems this information does not carry over when the control is recreated. p  pDoes anyone have any ideas for how to do this Am I missing somethingp  pedit I should clarify that the ctlGroup controls that are created in the datalist are created dynamically because they are recursive calls. I dont know any other way to call a control from itself, but if t here is a better way, I would love to hear it.p

Negative 83700 pThis is bizarre, but I am hoping someone can help me out. p  pI have a stored procedure call which takes about 42 seconds to run  when called from an application connected by an ODBC connection. However, if I run that same call in SSMS Sql Server Management Studio, it takes only 10 or 15 seconds to execute.as recorded by a trace. p  pThis does not appear to be a network issue. I am only passing about 1200 records back to the client  and in any case, the times I gave you were coming straight from a trace duration field.so it is taking SQL Server 3 or 4 times longer to process the same call  when done via an ODBC call. I can reproduce this over and over again. What is more interesting, is that the reads and writes taken from the trace are a little higher for the ODBC call, but the CPU usage is 3 or 4 times what the SSMS call is.p  pThere are other stored procs called as part of the same process, and they do not appear to be affected in the same way...or at least not to the same extent.p  pWe are using SQL Server 2005p  pAny ideas about what is going on herep

Am I wrong about this, or is there another way to achieve the same affect that Im not aware ofp  pEdit One possibility that occurs to me is to go ahead and use regular django model inheritance, set the base Goal class to abstract as required and create the submodels, and then instead of trying to query for Goal entities, creating a model for each user with a ListField that contains references to the various subclass entities and retrieving the ListField.  Does this seem like a workable alternativep

Negative 83700 pDataMapper idea is a hrefhttpdatamapper.orgwhy relnofollowdefinitely bettera than ActiveRecord. It has one API for a variety of data stores, including RDBMS and NoSQL stores.  DataMapper is much smarter then ActiveRecord. It has Strategic Eager Loading. This feature singlehandedly wipes out the N1 Query Problem. Additionally it allows lazyloading of heavy fields like Text property. DataMapper allows you to create and search for any complex object graph simply by providing a nested hash of conditions. ActiveRecods is unsuitable to be used for associations in production. include method is ugly and unconfigurable. In October 2010  Josh Symonds makes a a hrefhttpsrails.lighthouseapp.comprojects8994rubyonrailstickets3662excludefieldsfromeagerloadedmodels relnofollowpatch for this methoda to allow fields to be excluded from eager loaded. But that path was ignored and today in rails3 we have same ugly include method.  p  pEven in Rails3 with brilliant AREL, ActiveRecord is far from the best orm for rails. You may say wow, that new gem metawhere allows to write nice code like codeArticle.wheretitle.matches gt Hello, createdat.gt gt 3.days.agocode. But wait... DataMapper supports this out of a box Maybe instead of modifying ActiveRecord to looks like DataMapper better is to extend and support better orm More details of DataMapper can be found at a hrefhttpdatamapper.org relnofollowhttpdatamapper.orga. p  pI think, that rails in later releases should allow us to select which orm to use, like now it allows a database selection. Even it will has only one option ActiveRecord, people will search for available alternatives. When I was starting to learn rails, I thought that there is support only for ActiveRecord. And later I did not even try to look for something else. p  pWhy I am writing all this stuff I think, that we need to pay more attention to this nice ORM. If you are developer of some popular or not so popular gem, think about adding support of DataMapper. DataMapper community should write some migration guides from ActiveRecord or another ORM and keep documentation uptodate and your may help them. As for me, DataMapper community needs more people and you may be one of them. The only disadvantage of this ORM is lack of documentation and you may help.p  pSo what do you think about thatp

Negative 83700 pI would like to develop a Windows build of my Android game for testing and demo purposes. Most of my code is C, using OpenGL to render, with a thin AndroidJava layer that forwards touch events and loads resources.p  pMy first thought was to make a Visual Studio project for my Windows version, as Im familiar with it and the debugger is excellent.p  pCan I get similar C debugging functionality with Eclipse amp CDT It seems tidier to have all versions working from the same IDE, and it would be nice to become less dependant on proprietary software. Would I be able to add a Windows build configuration in CDT, switch over, and have the IDE launch amp debug my Windows version instead Or would I be entering a world of pain setting this upp  pAre there any other approaches I havent considered All advice welcomep

It works well for single conversions that have a unique label and value.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pOn the site I have a use case where a user can fire multiple very similar looking conversions in short succession. Sometimes these conversions are unique, sometimes they could match one or more of the other conversion values and labels.p  pWhen I submit these conversions, it tracks some of them, and not others.p  pAt first, I was adding the conversion snippet to the page, so I figured it was including conversions.js only once, and not firing the others. So, to fix that, I moved the conversion snippet to an iFrame and put that on the page. That had the same problem, but was definitely including conversions.js. I was worried that the problem may have to do with the fact that theyre fired in quick succession, so I made them wait before firing the next. I tried intervals of 1,2, and 4 seconds, none of which solved the issue.p  pIn an attempt to figure out what was going wrong, I beautified conversions.js, and found a debug option. I turned it on, and it was warning on all conversions about a missing conversionid  I tried adding googleconversionid, and just set it to a timestamp, so it would always be unique. This didnt solve the problem either.p  pI finally tried just ditching the iFrames, and adding the tracking pixel to the page. The tracking pixel still fires the conversions just fine, and seems to add an iFrame to the page, then delete it. Unfortunately, the conversions still are missing.p  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pIn light of this not working in any of many different ways, Im wondering if google is deduping my similar conversions. The docs have no information that shed light on this, but they also dont document the googleconversionid, so theres plenty going on that isnt documented.p  pIf they are, why wouldnt googleconversionid fix this It seems that should unique each lead. I cant append to the label or value, and Im making all my requests with a cachebuster appended to the end to make sure its not on the browser end. I can verify that its working, as either conversions.js gets included or the iFrame shows up.p  pAny ideas Anyone know where I can ask a googler about this Its driving me CRAZY.p

Negative 83700 pI am attaching a picture where I have shown the diagram for which I need to check the goodbad blocks. Basically, I have the information of size of each block and number of rows and column.

Negative 83700 pI used a modified version of the code here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions928928determiningwhatclassesaredefinedinaphpclassfile68111676811167Determining what classes are defined in a PHP Class filea to create a multidimensional array of classes and functions from a specific list of files.

I feel as though I wasted your time.p  pYou guys are right about the foreach but this was a tricky one.

Negative 83700 pI have seen how to have multiple autocompletes in a single textarea, but what I want to due is have something that can select a term in the middle of the textarea, or more precisely wherever the cursor iswas in the textarea.  Most solutions I have seen only work if the user is working on the end of the input string.  I would like to have something along the lines of being able to start with the string   George stepped on foot. then go back to the middle of the string and start typing to change it to this   George stepped on Fredricks foot. according to Mary and have Fredrick and Mary each separately show up as an autocomplete option.p  pfor the specific use I want this functionality for, the autocomplete will happen on character strings that start with either a  or a  symbol, but they will not necessarily be the first or last of the given symbol. p  pI am using javascript and jqueryui for this task. this is for use on mobile devices so the position of the autocomplete will always just be at the bottom of the text area.p

Negative 83700 pI have a single html page with a large amount of content however, most of the content is hidden and only gets displayed when the user clicks a link in the sidebar and JQuery dynamically changes the content div being shown.

Negative 83700 pIs there a way to require an element depending on the enumeration value entered for another elementp  pBasically, what Im trying to do is have an user interface type defined by an enumeration. Depending on the interface type, some fields may or may not be required.p  pI understand this could be achieved either by making the elements optional, and handling the conditional logic in the Code, or by making different complex types for every possible interface type. However, I want the rules to be apparent to anyone reading the schema, so the Code solution wouldnt be ideal, and adding a ton of complex types, even though they share most of their required fields in common, would add a lot more to the xml parsing logic.p  pIs it possible to have all this logic contained in the schema to simplify validation and parsingp

Negative 83700 pIve been given responsibility over a number of stored procedures, which take the formp  precodecreate procedure getFoos begin     set vsql                      set vsql  concatvsql, select distinct , getFooFieldsf, b,       set vsql  concatvsql, from Foos f      set vsql  concatvsql,   left join Bars b on f.barID b.barID     set vsql  concatvsql, where f.someDate is null      set vsql  concatvsql,   and b.someID in 1, 2, 3      set vsql  concatvsql,   and b.someBool  true      set vsql  concatvsql, order by f.name       prepare s1 from vsql     execute s1     deallocate prepare s1   end codepre  pAs you can see, dynamic SQL is being used so that a function codegetFooFieldscode can be inlined. That function is used simply to build up the string of selected fieldsp  precodecreate function getFooFields     ialiasForFoo varchar32,     ialiasForBar varchar32  returns text reads sql data begin     declare vfields text default       set vfields  concatvfields, ialiasForFoo, .fooID as fooId, ,      set vfields  concatvfields, ialiasForFoo, .someDate as someDate , ,      set vfields  concatvfields, ialiasForFoo, .name as name, ,       additional Foo fields     set vfields  concatvfields, ialiasForBar, .someID as someID , ,      set vfields  concatvfields, ialiasForBar, .someBool as someBool , ,       additional Bar fields      return vfields end codepre  pThe reason for this seems to be better maintainability  when the codeFooscode or codeBarscode tables are altered, changes only have to be made in the one function instead of many procedures.  However this is coming at the cost of using dynamic SQL, as well as an extra function which builds up the same string every single time its called.  Im wondering if theres a way to keep the maintainability while moving the work to before runtime.p  pAs it happens, we are managing our SQL in Eclipse and using Ant to massage these files before running them on the database prior to every deployment. Is there a way we could script Ant to do the work of codegetFooFieldscode instead I imagine something like the followingp  precodeselect distinct ltfoofieldsgt from Foos ... codepre  pWhere Ant would replace codeltfoofieldsgtcode with a string similar to what codegetFooFieldscode is building. But of course this is further complicated by the fact that codegetFooFieldscode takes parameters so Im not sure how that would work.p  pIs this idea completely misguided I hardly have any experience with Ant so I cant tell.  Alternatively, what are other ways I could remove these procedures dependence on dynamic SQL while keeping the them maintainablep

Negative 83700 pOkey, so I decided to go with backbone.js in my rails app, but I feel that Im doing a lot of redundant coding. Im having a lot of models and templates in backbone that are more or less the same as their rails equivalent. Is there some kind of gem that handles this Something like actasbackbonemodel that you put in to your rails model that generates the backbonemodel with possibility to be overridden to add functionality. Also it would be great if there existed some kind of railsbackboneview gem that lets you put your templates in your views directory and use normal partialsreuse normal rails views.p

I have Paint.NET but the adjust hue doesnt work for me because changing the hue alone does not give me the colors I want.p  pBasically what I need to do is for every pixel in the image, take the RGBA value and replace the RGB with a new RGB value and keep the same A value.p  pAnyone know how to do this I had no luck searching on StackOverflow or Google probably using the wrong search terms.p  pI would prefer an answer in C or VB.NET but if anyone knows how to do this in any language maybe I can apply it to C or VB.NET.p  pEditp  pIn case anyone finds this and is looking for the answer, heres what I got based on the link from Yorye Nathan.p  precodeprivate const int RED  51 private const int GREEN  181 private const int BLUE  229  private const int NEWRED  170 private const int NEWGREEN  102 private const int NEWBLUE  204  private void Form1Loadobject sender, EventArgs e    if openFileDialog1.ShowDialog  System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK         Image OriginalImage  Image.FromFileopenFileDialog1.FileName     Image NewImage  ColorFilterOriginalImage      pictureBox1.Image  OriginalImage     pictureBox2.Image  NewImage       public static Image ColorFilterImage originalImage    Bitmap newImage  new BitmaporiginalImage   BitmapData originalData  originalImage as Bitmap.LockBitsnew Rectangle0, 0, originalImage.Width, originalImage.Height, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageLockMode.ReadWrite, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb    BitmapData newData  newImage as Bitmap.LockBitsnew Rectangle0, 0, originalImage.Width, originalImage.Height, ImageLockMode.ReadWrite, PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb    int originalStride  originalData.Stride   System.IntPtr originalScan0  originalData.Scan0    int newStride  newData.Stride   System.IntPtr newScan0  newData.Scan0    unsafe        byte pOriginal  bytevoidoriginalScan0     byte pNew  bytevoidnewScan0      int nOffset  originalStride  originalImage.Width  4      byte red, green, blue      for int y  0 y lt originalImage.Height y            for int x  0 x lt originalImage.Width x                blue  pOriginal[0]         green  pOriginal[1]         red  pOriginal[2]          if pOriginal[0]  BLUE ampamp pOriginal[1]  GREEN ampamp pOriginal[2]  RED                    pNew[0]  byteNEWBLUE           pNew[1]  byteNEWGREEN           pNew[2]  byteNEWRED                   pOriginal  4         pNew  4              pOriginal  nOffset       pNew  nOffset           originalImage as Bitmap.UnlockBitsoriginalData   newImage as Bitmap.UnlockBitsnewData   return newImage  codepre

Negative 83700 pIm totally willing to submit to the idea that my hardware is the cause of the problem here, however I dont honestly think so because Ive definitely seen the computer handle both kinds of input simultaneously using other softwaregamesetc, so Im guessing that the fault here is my approach to the PyGame event handler.p  pIm casually mucking about with Python and PyGame, and have just being trying to build my knowledge a piece at a time and express that knowledge by building a game as Im learning.  This is very much a workinprogress, theres no implementation of anything like collision detection or scorekeeping, I figure that can come later.p  pThe relevant conundrum here is that the game will execute MOUSEMOTION events, and KEYDOWN events, it just doesnt seem to want to handle them at the same time.  While the player object is moving, it cannot shoot, and while it is shooting, it cannot move.  Since most gamers enjoy the luxury of moving while shooting, I see this as a something of a snag.p  precodeimport pygame, random, sys from pygame.locals import   pygame.init  width  640 height  480   DISPLAYSURF  pygame.display.setmodewidth, height pygame.display.setcaptionIt moves pygame.mouse.setvisible0    class Playerpygame.sprite.Sprite      def initself, x, y         pygame.sprite.Sprite.initself          self.x  x         self.y  y         self.width  50         self.height  25         self.playerRect  None        def updateself, event         if event.type  MOUSEMOTION             self.x, self.y  event.pos           get a new playerRect and draw it         self.playerRect  pygame.Rectself.x, self.y, self.width, self.height         pygame.draw.ellipseDISPLAYSURF, RED, self.playerRect, 3       def shotcheckself, event         if event.type  KEYDOWN             if event.key  KKP8                 return True, up             elif event.key  KKP2                 return True, down             elif event.key  KKP4                 return True, left             elif event.key  KKP6                 return True, right             elif event.key  KKP7                 return True, upleft             elif event.key  KKP1                 return True, downleft             elif event.key  KKP9                 return True, upright             elif event.key  KKP3                 return True, downright             else                 return 0, 0    class Enemypygame.sprite.Sprite     def initself, x, y         pygame.sprite.Sprite.initself         self.x  x         self.y  y         self.body  pygame.rect.Rectself.x, self.y, 15, 15         self.speed  5         self.xmove  0         self.ymove  0        def updateself, event         self.x  self.speed         if self.x gt 350             self.speed  1         elif self.x lt 25             self.speed  1          pygame.draw.rectDISPLAYSURF, BLUE, self.x, self.y, 15, 15, 4    pass it a directional value when fired based on the key may have to divide speed  2 if moving diagonally class Bulletpygame.sprite.Sprite     def initself, x, y, direction         pygame.sprite.Sprite.initself         self.x  x         self.y  y         self.direction  direction         self.width  4         self.height  4         self.bulletRect  None         self.speed  8        def updateself, event          if self.direction  up             self.y  self.speed          elif self.direction  down             self.y  self.speed          elif self.direction  left             self.x  self.speed          elif self.direction  right             self.x  self.speed          elif self.direction  upleft             self.x  self.speed2             self.y  self.speed2          elif self.direction  downleft             self.x  self.speed2             self.y  self.speed2          elif self.direction  upright             self.x  self.speed2                 self.y  self.speed2          elif self.direction  downright             self.x  self.speed2             self.y  self.speed2           self.bulletRect  pygame.Rectself.x, self.y, 4, 4         pygame.draw.ellipseDISPLAYSURF, GREEN, self.bulletRect, 2      FPS  30 fpsClock  pygame.time.Clock   RED  255, 0, 0 GREEN  0, 255, 0 BLUE  0, 0, 255 BLACK  0, 0, 0    ship  Playerwidth  2, height  2 bads  Enemywidth  2, height  2    queue  pygame.sprite.Group queue.addship queue.addbads   while True     DISPLAYSURF.fillBLACK     for event in pygame.event.get         if event.type  QUIT             sys.exit           passes event to everything in the queue and calls         their obj.update.  in this way the gameloop          is a bit more readable     for thing in queue         thing.updateevent      try im not married to this bit of code          checkForShot, shotDirection  ship.shotcheckevent         if checkForShot             shotx, shoty  ship.playerRect.center             shot  Bulletshotx, shoty, shotDirection             queue.addshot     except TypeError         pass      pygame.display.flip     fpsClock.tickFPS codepre  pIm aware that this essentially produces a really uninspired Robotron clone, but like I said, this is a toddler project of mine that Im putting together while running through tutorials online.  Yes, theres a needless import random for now, its going to matter later.p  pIm guessing that theres a couple of hangups for starters I dont like the way that the creation of bullets is being handled the player object should, in my mind, add them to the game queue itself instead of returning a TrueFalse tuple, but it seemed sort of unintuitive to have the player object mention the queue directly.  and handling it with a tryexcept feels lazy, but maybe Im being critical.  However I also sense that this problem is tantamount to figuring out how to deal with getting the event handler to properly thing.update for simultaneous moving MOUSEMOTION and shooting KEYDOWN.p  pAnd I am also guessing that in order to get this to behave more as one would expect that I need to tell it to handle KEYUP events as well.  However, Im still just stymied as to why exactly the event handler seems to pick one event.type and ignore the other in my experience its been whichever one came first.  p
Negative 83700 pMy program is wellsuited for MPI.  Each CPU does its own, specific sophisticated job, produces a single codedoublecode, and then I use an codeMPIReducecode to multiply the result from every CPU.p  pBut I repeat this many, many times  100,000.  Thus, it occurred to me that a GPU would dramatically speed things up.p  pI have googled around, but cant find anything concrete.  How do you go about mixing MPI with GPUs  Is there a way for the program to query and verify strongoh, emthisem rank is the GPU, all other are CPUs strong  Is there a recommended tutorial or somethingp  pImportantly, I dont want or need a full set of GPUs.  I really just need a lot of CPUs, and then a single GPU to speed up the frequentlyused codeMPIReducecode operation.p  pHere is a schematic example of what Im talking aboutp  pSuppose I have 500 CPUs.  Each CPU somehow produces, say, 50 codedoublecodes.  I need to multiply all 250,00 of these codedoublecodes together.  Then I repeat this between 10,000 and 1 million times.  If I could have one GPU in addition to the 500 CPUs, this could be really efficient.  Each CPU would compute its 50 codedoublecodes for all 1 million states.  Then, all 500 CPUs would send their codedoublecodes to the GPU.  The GPU would then multiply the 250,000 codedoublecodes together for each of the 1 million states, producing 1 million codedoublescode.br These numbers are not exact.  The compute is indeed very large.  Im just trying to convey the general problem.p

Negative 83700 pI have multiple fragments within an activity. Every fragment has to display some data that is fetched from the server using REST. I have been implementing codeIntentServicecode with a corresponding receiver for REST requests. Right now I am able to do this by making fragments as inner class within the activity.p  pThe problem I have with inner class is, on orientation change, an error is thrown like cannot instantiate fragment, no empty constructor. For this problem, on search I found answers like either make the inner class static or create a standalone public class for Fragment. I still dont understand why would this happen on orientation change. p  pNow if I take the approach of creating a separate standalone class for Fragment, I will have to pass the activity object around to do codestartServicecode and coderegisterReceivercode. And I do not want to use codeAsyncTaskcode for this, as in my app I perform multiple REST requests within a single fragment and codeIntentServicecode allows a broadcast to be sent after every request so that I do not have to wait until all the requests are finished to start loading the screen. And I feel it is not ok to pass activity object to a fragment. Shouldnt the fragment be as loosely coupled as possible with the activity so that same fragment can be used within multiple activities If yes, what would be the best approach in resolving thisp

Negative 83700 pMy overriding question is this  In Android codePreferenceActivitycode, how can I write an codeOnClickListenercode which will have the same functionality as pressing the Android back button as I navigate through codePreferenceScreencode defined menus  That is to say, I would like users of my App to explicity see a menu choice Back which will bring them to the previous menu, or bring them out of the menu activity to their previous activity if they are at the root of this particular codePreferenceActivitycode session.  p  pThe a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidpreferencePreferenceActivity.html relnofollowandroid developer documents tell usa p  blockquote   pNote that this XML resource contains a preference screen holding another fragment, the Prefs1FragmentInner implemented here. This allows the user to traverse down a hierarchy of preferences pressing back will pop each fragment off the stack to return to the previous preferences.p blockquote  pAnd they are correct about that.  I navigate happily through my menus by clicking on codePreferenceScreencode items to get to that screen, and using the Android back button to go Back up a level.  But Im not sure a casual user really understands the Back button, I know I didnt until I read about it in Developer docs.  SO I would would like them to have an explicit codePreferencecode defined menu choice whos codeOnClickListenercode duplicates the function of the Android back button.  p  pSo I tried to put in a Preference in my menu that would go back.  Having determined that a not Overriden codeonBackPressedcode in a my subclass of codePreferenceActivitycode just referred back to codeActivity.onBackPressedcode which merely calls codefinishcode, I tried this codeOnClickListenercodep  precodeprivate OnPreferenceClickListener clickFinishesSuccessfully  new OnPreferenceClickListener      Override     public boolean onPreferenceClickPreference preference          finish         return true       codepre  pAs it turns out, this did NOT do the same thing as pressing the back button  Pressing this button always took me out of the codePreferenceActivitycode entirely, back to the codeActivitycode from which I had called my codePreferenceActivitycode.  Specifically, it did NOT navigate back through my menus no matter how deep I was when I clicked it.  p  pI am guessing here When I have gotten to a submenu by clicking an onscreen preference which is really a codePreferenceScreencode, I am no longer in my own codePreferenceActivitycode.  I must be in some other Activity  p  pSo my functional question what can I put in my OnClickListener of my Back codePreferencecode to get the same function as the Android Back button navigating through my menusp

Negative 83700 pI am creating a program which will calculate Betwenness Centrality for all nodes in a strongunweightedstrong graph. To do that I have to find ASSSP All Single Source Shortest Paths. While creating the program, I came to realize that eventually I will have ties same distance from source to destination but different paths. This lead me to this question. How should I resolves these ties If I use random tie breakers, then each output of the Betweenness Centrality might be slightly different for the same input. Let me make a small exemplary graphp  precode   A     B    C        D codepre  pNow lets say that the A node is our source for which we wish to find ASSSP.

Now which one should I choose, and on what conditionp  pstrongRandom Tie breakers problemstrongp  pIf I use random tie breakers, like the first one to be found, is marked as the shortest path the program is distributed so this solution will work in a random fashion. Then I will have problem with Betweenness Centrality, as the value will vary for nodes B and C depending on which path was marked as the shortest.p  pDoes anyone know how to solve this issue, or am I just missing somethingp

Negative 83700 pI have been given multiple solutions to what I thought would be a common scenario.  Unfortunately, none seem to work as expected.p  pI have created a pretty simple android game.  The users can invite friends to play and there are a few activities they are routed through during the game lifecycle.  All turns and data is stored in a remote server which is exposing the data through web services.  Every time an invitation is sent, or the opponents complete their turn, the user is prompted via the service to play their turn.p  pThe service prompts the user using a standard android notification telling them its their turn.  I dont want the service to poll the web service or present notifications while the user is viewing the game theyll already know if its there turn.p  pI have tried the following solutions without any success.p  ol lipStart the service in the onPause method of the main activity and stop the service in the onResume method of the main activity.p  ul liProblem  Each time the user leaves the activity for another one the service starts.  The user may be writing something or creating an invitation and they are prompted to take their turn.li ulli lipBind each activity to the service and set a boolean running flag in the same onPauseonResume methods of all activities.p  ul liProblem  This seems logical, but for some reason the service never presents a notification.  This is likely usererror, but Im not sure this is the correct solution anyway.li ulli lipStart the service in the onPause method of all activities and stop the service in the onResume method of all activities.p  ul liProblem  Based on the toasts Im presenting on the screen showing the state of the service this works as expected.  The problem is the user is presented with notifications while the service is off.  Apparently my toasts are misleading.li ulli ol  pAny help is greatly appreciated.  Sample code is not necessary, but would be appreciated if the solution is any more complex than the concept described above.p  pThank you.p

Negative 83700 pIn my iOS apps Settings screen, there is one setting which is quite fundamental. I wish to inform users about this with a UIAlertView.p  pPreferably I would display this when the back button is pressed and thus they are finished editing their settings.

And if it is possible, how do I do itp  pemstrongEdit  2nd August 2012emstrong  My app has its own Settings screen in addition to the built in Settings screen, so my question applies to both screens.

Negative 83700 pI am implementing autocomplete in a WPF ComboBox. Every time a new character is input in the combo, I want to have a database lookup getting items to populate the combo with. Max 20 to not make it too long.p  pSo when I input some text in the combo, I populate its item based on whats input this far, getting data from an class called dataSource I have provided.p  pThe problems are the following If I write a letter that results in any hits, the character will be selected so another keypress will make it replaced and a correct search will be performed. The replacement char will not be selected. If I add a character to that, the text box will be cleared but a correct search for a string using those two characters will be performed. The dropdown will still be dropped down showing the results. If I add a character, a search will be performed, but the character will not be selected.p  pIf I start from the beginning, write a char that does not result in any hits, the character is not selected, the dropdown will not be opened. I can input more text, now without hitting anything, the dropdown will never open just as I want it.p  pThe user control containing the ComboBoxp  precodeltUserControl xClassFoo.Controls.AutoComplete.AutoCompleteIntIdTextBox     xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006gt   ltStackPanel OrientationVerticalgt     ltComboBox         ItemsSourceBinding Hits, IsAsyncTrue     DisplayMemberPathLabel     SelectionChangedComboBoxSelectionChanged     KeyUpComboBoxKeyUpgt       ltComboBox.ItemsPanelgt     ltItemsPanelTemplategt       ltVirtualizingStackPanel gt     ltItemsPanelTemplategt       ltComboBox.ItemsPanelgt     ltComboBoxgt   ltStackPanelgt ltUserControlgt codepre  pThe code behindp  precodeusing System.Windows using System.Windows.Controls using System.Windows.Input using System.ComponentModel using System.Threading using System.Windows.Threading using System  namespace Foo.Controls.AutoComplete    public partial class AutoCompleteIntIdTextBox  UserControl        public AutoCompleteIntIdTextBox            InitializeComponent       DataContext  this           private object dbLock  new object      public delegate void AutoCompleteHitEventHandlerAutoCompleteIntIdHit hit     public event AutoCompleteHitEventHandler Changed       public static DependencyProperty HitsProperty        DependencyProperty.Register         Hits, typeofAutoCompleteIntIdHit[], typeofAutoCompleteIntIdTextBox      public AutoCompleteIntIdHit[] Hits            get  return AutoCompleteIntIdHit[]GetValueHitsProperty        set  SetValueHitsProperty, value             public static DependencyProperty HitProperty        DependencyProperty.Register     Hit, typeofAutoCompleteIntIdHit, typeofAutoCompleteIntIdTextBox      public AutoCompleteIntIdHit Hit            get  return AutoCompleteIntIdHitGetValueHitProperty        set  SetValueHitProperty, value            private AutoCompleteIntIdQueryable dataSource          public AutoCompleteIntIdQueryable SuggestionsDataSource            get  return dataSource        set  dataSource  value             public int id            get  return Hit  null  int null  int Hit.id        set  Hit  value.HasValue  dataSource.ByIDvalue.Value  null            private int numSuggestions  20     public int NumSuggestions            get  return numSuggestions        set  numSuggestions  value            private void ComboBoxSelectionChangedobject sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e            var hit  Hit        if hit  null         Changedhit           private void ComboBoxKeyUpobject sender, KeyEventArgs e            var combo  ComboBoxsender       var text  combo.Text        Hits  dataSource.WhereLabelStartsWithtext, numSuggestions        combo.IsDropDownOpen  Hits.Length gt 0          codepre  pAutoCompleteIntIdQueryablep  precodeusing System  namespace Foo.Controls.AutoComplete    public interface AutoCompleteIntIdQueryable        AutoCompleteIntIdHit[] WhereLabelStartsWithString str, int num     AutoCompleteIntIdHit ByIDint id     codepre

Negative 83700 pI am attempting to implement a UIScrollView where horizontally panning scrolls through pictures in the scrollview but vertically panning performs another action I have. Right now I have a UIScrollView that is paginated with vertical scrolling disabled that works just fine for scrolling through pictures, but am going crazy trying to find a way to intercept vertical pans and call my own method instead of the vertical pans just being eaten up by the scrollview. I was able to do  p  precode    UIPanGestureRecognizer panUp  [[UIPanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTargetself actionselectorhandlePanGesture] [self.scrollView addGestureRecognizerpanUp] [scrollView.panGestureRecognizer setEnabledNO] codepre  pWhich gives me total control over the panning in my handlePanGesture method, but this isnt particularly helpful because then I feel like I am essentially going to be rewriting all the scrolling logic which I am trying to avoid.

Maybe its an AI thing, I dont know. p  pThe problem is that I now use Blend to convert this canvas into a GraphicBrush. The blend omits the transform and the logo looks upiside down when brush is applied. Rather then again transforming at each brush recipient I was thinking that maybe we should just fix it at the root, e.g. convert all paths so that they render properly to begin with avoiding a need for root transform.p  pQuestion is there a programmatic or any other way to do this Meaning, can I render this canvas and then serialize a rendered after all transforms applied DOM into an XAML p  pOr to make  the question clearer there are two transforms applied to each path as seen above, one global flip and one local shift for each path, can I somehow apply those transforms to each pathits points so that paths render without them.p

Negative 83700 pIm very new to Django and not super familiar with web programming in general, so its very likely that there is an easy fix to my problem that Im just unaware of. p  pMy web app is a photo gallery. People can click on a photo to see an enlarged version with buttons on either side for older or newer pictures. In addition, the photos in the gallery can be sorted by tags, which are passed along as URL parameters.p  pMy problem is that when I click on one of the submit buttons, Django replaces the parameters in my URL with the name of the button, thus destroying my reference to what tag I was using.

Negative 83700 pIm developing a node module codemymodulecode which in turn depends on another module codeothermodulecode. codeothermodulecode is thus a dependency explicitly listed in my modules package.json.p  pAs my module modifies the behaviour of codeothermodulecode just by being coderequirecoded, it is important that codeothermodulecode is loaded only once and that this, oneandonly instance is the one referenced throughout any application that requires both codemycode and codeothercode.p  pI expected this to hold true according to nodes Module Caching Policy but what Ive come across while writing a simple test app is thisp  pIf codemymodulecode is codenpm installcodeed embeforeem codeothermodulecode then the latter is brought in as a dependency of the former. codenpm installcodeing codeothermodulecode afterwards brings it into the nodemodules hierarchy a second time. Then, when my module requires codeothermodulecode, node loads my modules local copy and when the app coderequirecodes  it a second time node loads it emagainem, this time the version that was installed due to the second codenpm installcode. This obviously is not the intended result.p  pIf codemymodulecode is codenpm installecoded emafterem codeothermodulecode then I end up with emonly one copyem of codeothermodulecode in nodemodules and my test app works as expected.p  pThis behaviour got me looking through nodes relevant policies again and sure enough I came across the Module Caching Caveatsp  blockquote   pModules are cached based on their resolved filename. Since modules may resolve to a different filename based on the location of the calling module loading from nodemodules folders, it is not a guarantee that requirefoo will always return the exact same object, if it would resolve to different files.p blockquote  pAt this point it looks like that my module may or may not behave as expected depending on the order of codenpm installcodes.p  pAre there any best practices Im missing Is there any way to avoid this mess without changing the way my module worksp

Negative 83700 pSo far Ive been writing emonescriptem Python programs, mainly for text processing and data analysis.p  pNow I want to bring one of my old Matlab simulation project to PythonNumPy. In that project I have one main program in a code.mcode file with a few tens of functions each in a separate code.mcode file. There were global variables that were used across all functions so that I dont have to input them as arguments for every function. But then I cant runtest individual function without running the main program, because the global variables will then be undefined, or it calls another function in another file. Plus the file organizing is a mess. It is painful to add new functions, changing existing ones, especially the main program.p  pThis time I want to do things emproperlyem. I want the program to have a proper emarchitectureem, if its the right word. First I need to know to organize all those functions. I dont think each little function having its own file is a good idea. I think maybe I can divide those functions into several groups and each group can be one file Will it be a code.pycode file or some other kind of file Second I would like it to be easily expandable, that I can add new functions easily.p  pI believe there must be some standard way of doing this, but I have no clue. p  pOne more question when I run a Matlab program, after it finishes, I still have all the variables in the emworkspaceem, so I can still check the numbers, make plots, etc. But when I run my python script through IPython shell, it clears everything afterwards. Is there a similar thing as the emworkspaceemp

Negative 83700 pWe have following structure in our teamp  ul liUsing Git with central storage at Bitbucketli liUsing development remote server Debian, which contains all the code from development branch at the main domain project.example.comli liEach developer has his own instance on a server physically it is a subfolder in document root with symlincs to nonchangeable core files of CMF with his own subdomain dev01.project.example.com.li ul  pWhat we need is tracking all the local codebase changes in remote instance for each developer.p  pFirst most obvious solution is to use strongGitstrong for that  create a remote repositoryies on a development server and push changes from local instance to remote. But this is the worst solution, since devs will have to create commits for every single change including debug messages and all the tries to fix some error output, which will fill Gits log with strongtons of useless commitsstrong, so devs will loose all the benefits of local repositories  will have to strongspend much time for logs cleaningstrong before pushing their changes to Bitbucket.p  pSecond option  stronglocal serverstrong. But this also brings issues, since in our structure we all are using single db, so it will bring one more complexity of strongreplicating remote db and merging it with local changesstrong too often. Also it will be stronghard to replicate the dev environmentstrong on local workstations Windows based. And I personally dislike the idea of local servers on every machine, since workstation are served for code production, and server  for code work in real environment.p  pThird option  strongFTP syncstrong. We all are using phpStorm, which has an option of remote sync via FTP. And it works, like a charm, when you change the code and press CtrlS  all you changes appear immediately on a remote instance. But, if you pull remote code by Git, you need to strongsynchronize your local files with remotestrong ones by FTP  and this runs strongtoo slowstrong 1520 mins in our case, because phpStorm compares contents of all the files we have 3k php files in our project currently. Sure, we can run comparing by size, but this is nontrustable solution.p  pFourth solution  strongSambastrong. We tried it as well. It was strongnot much faster, than FTPstrong with both subsolutions p  ol lisync local files with those, that are located in mounted Sambas driveli liwork directly on mounted driveli ol  pSecond one was even worse, since we had internet connection problem and phpStorm hang forever after that...p  pI also was searching for an existing solutions, but most things, what I found were synchronization utilities, like a hrefhttpwww.cis.upenn.edubcpierceunison relnofollowunisona, which must run manually and, actually, it is not, what I looking for  I need not a sync, but strongreplication utilitystrong, which monitors some local folder and pushes every single changed file or even better  delta to a remote location without developers interaction.p  pSo, devs workflow must be kept as simple, as possible p  ul liCtrlS in IDE replicates on remoteli ligit pull replicates on remoteli ligit checkout  replicates on remoteli liand so on...li ul  pSomething, like Dropbox, but with possibility to sync any folder  exclude some subfolders from replication, and which works oneway only local  remote. Which tools may fit our needsp

Negative 83700 pI am trying to set up the right indices on a table I have just created which contains 4 polymorphic associations and a PK codeIDcode. The 4 associations allow me not to have to quadruple the number of tables to the addition I am making to the database and should not be modified in this discussion. My question is how should I set up the indices so that I get optimal performance speed, space not so much  None of the 4 keys is candidate for PK. More specifically all 4 are but only one at a time. I have added a PK ID because I had read that adding a PK, even if not used, is better than not adding a PK. However, I am questionning this assertion more and more.p  pMore about the table  the logic that only 1 of the 4 FKs should be used is enforced by an Access form. Nobody nondev has access to the tables directly. I expect there will be no more than a couple hundred entries every month for as long as this database is in use. Assuming we use it 10 more years and average 500 entries a month which is probably a bit more than what it will be we should have no more than 60k entries in 10 years. Basically, this is not a hugely populated table.p  pThe db and forms run on Access 2003 yeah I know....p  pI hope that is enough information for you to help me. In the image below you can see the table structure as it is right now. The 4 FKs are codeNoDemandeAmendementTransitcode, codeNoDemandeAmendementRubriquecode, codeNoAmendementTransitcode, codeNoAmendementRubriquecode.p  pMany thanks.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFNfgg.png altenter image description herep

Negative 83700 pGood afternoon everyone. p  pI have a USB gamepad that Im attempting to write a userspace driver for. Originally, I wrote the driver to work with Linux using libusb, and everything seems to work fine there.p  pBasically, I get all the useful data e.g. X, Y coordinates and button presses from the device and store it in an array that is printfd onto the screen. Now I can get this far with OS X easily. p  pHowever, I dont know how to broadcast that data so it can be used by other applications. I realize that one workaround is to call CGEventCreateKeyboardEvent, where I could basically map the devices buttons to keystrokes. However, I would rather not use emulated keystrokes because some information for example the X, Y coordinates is difficult to represent as keystroke events. p  pIm unfamiliar with IOKit, so is there a function available there or somewhere else buried in Apple documentation that will help me do this And, if so, will I have to rewrite my current driver to be able to utilize the IOKitotherApplelibrary way Or is there some, supereasytouse function where I can take my data and send it to any foreground applicationp  pThanks in advance to everyone willing to helpp

Negative 83700 pSuppose I want to write a function that will produce a string, and while I can set an upper limit on the size of the string I dont know in advance exactly how much space the string will take up. I can think of two ways to arrange thisp  precodechar ParametersAsString1int temperature, float pressure      char buffer1[128]     snprintfbuffer1, 128, temperature d pressure g,         temperature, pressure     return strdupbuffer1   char ParametersAsString2int temperature, float pressure      char buffer2  malloc128     snprintfbuffer2, 128, temperature d pressure g,         temperature, pressure     return buffer2  codepre  pThe only difference I can see is that the second form will potentially waste a bit of memory it uses 128 bytes for codebuffer2code for that variables entire existence. The first function uses 128 bytes for codebuffer1code plus whatever memory the string actually uses, but when codebuffer1code is removed from the stack the only memory that will be used is whatever the string actually needs.p  pIt looks like the first function would be better if the strings are longlived and there will be a bunch of them. Are there any other reasons to prefer one of these forms over the other This is an academic question Im not actually in a situation where using an extra 90 bytes makes a difference.p
Negative 83700 pIm looking for a way to simply set up a proxy locally that connects to a remote site. I dont want to install anything in the system proper. If I could call it with a single commandline call rather than mucking with even a single config file, that would be brilliant.p  pThe purpose is to sniff the traffic between my local app, which I am developing, and the remote server, which someone else is providing and which uses HTTPS.p  pPreferably it would be a Ruby, Python or Node package, so that I could just do something along the lines ofp  precodemkdir simplestproxy cd simplestproxy bundle init echo gem simplestproxy gtgt Gemfile bundle path vendorbundle bundle exec binsimplestproxy p 8080 httpsremote.site.example.com codepre  porp  precodevirtualenv simplestproxy cd simplestproxy bineasyinstall simplestproxy binsimplestproxy p 8080 httpsremote.site.example.com codepre  porp  precodemkdir simplestproxy cd simplestproxy npm install simplestproxy nodemodules.binsimplestproxy p 8080 httpsremote.site.example.com codepre  pIt would allow my app to connect to codelocalhost8080code, which would forward the request and rewrite the codeHostcode header and whatever else necessary to the remote site. I would be able to watch codelocode in WireShark and find out whats going on.p  pIve had a quick look around in pypi, rubygems and npm, but what I found so far was either not working codeproxyletcode, which otherwise looked very promising, intended for a much more complicated scenario and requiring setup codedjrevproxycode or expecting to be called with a correct codeHostcode codenodereverseproxycode rather than rewriting.p  pUPDATE Im going with an Apache with a codeProxyPasscode  codeProxyPassReversecode config for now, but it feels massively overkill and requires playing with config files.p  pUPDATE Another solution that is not applicable is an actual HTTP proxy rather than one emulating the remote site. Because the remote site is an HTTPS site, that would just make my app do a CONNECT within the proxy and nothing has been gained.p
Negative 83700 pI have recently begun working with cocoa and ObjectiveC, although I am not new to software concepts, and I have come across some curious and unanticipated behavior in the NSMutableArray Class.p  pFirst, I create and populate a NSMutableArray Object, with my custom objects of Class CustomClass which works fine.

How is it possible to do what I want, or is it impossible I know one solution would be to use a dummy data type and a type family, but I dont want to do that if there is another way because of the its complexity. Also, I this example I could have just used 1 instead of succ, but there are more complex cases where such a transformation to just one class is not possible. p

Negative 83700 pIn the process of creating a game for android, I stumbled into a bit of uncertainty. When creating the drawing of the graphics for the game, would it be best practice to implement explicit calls to rendering the graphics using OpenGL ES in the gameloop p  pCalling codesetRenderModecode with the codeRENDERMODEWHENDIRTYcode constant, will in my understanding disable the auto rendering of content, enabling control over skipping frames etc. But is this only advised for creating apps, giving no performance gain in games and is mostly just suited for apps with graphics content not necessarily updated each framep  pIs there any answer to this or will it come down to the implemention and discussionp  pI should also mention that the game is developed for the ouya giving me only one point of reference in terms of hardware As of now.p

Is it true And so if I dont have IO tasks that in async module also they wont run in parallel rather just appear top  pPlease help.p

Nothing seems to help, though, and the halfhour build time on Canonicals godawful armbased PPA farm is making me lose my mind.p  pWhen I do an aptget source zfsync, looking in the source directory fetched shows me no codedebianinstallcode file whatsoever.  I dont know why the PPA is stripping that file, but it apparently is  and without it, my script doesnt actually get installed.p  pPlease, please, are there any packaging gurus out there  Helpp

Negative 83700 pHow can I get the value of an attribute and use it in a conditional statement. For example I have codeltO Optiona LineNr1gtcode and this is element is a child under another parent element that gets grouped with other elements. So the condition I want is if [valueof Option is null] then [do nothing] elseif [check if the value of the attribute of the element under the next parent element with the same value is empty]. And if there are for example 3 parent elements that contain this element with the Option attribute and if all of the attributes are NOT empty  then group them.  I have the grouping done, but it is not connected with this attribute that I want to use now.

Negative 83700 pI am trying to develop a shiny app that will mount a map based heat map on a browser and allow you to change the variable shown on the heat map. The map is of a geographic region with GIS shape files and the variable chosen is then shown on the map as a heat map.

Negative 83700 pIve been working with ModelViewPresenter recently, and when I feel like I understand how to do things, I end up running into something new that I dont quite understand.p  pIn my current case, Im using a codePictureEditcode which is basically a glorified codePictureBoxcode as part of DevExpress WinForms controls, and while the codePictureEditcode is capable of zooming and scrolling, its not entirely how Id like it.p  pWhen you scroll with the mouse wheel, it causes the picture to pan up and down. I want this to instead zoom in and out by a specific amount. So I tried the followingp  precodepublic class AlteredPictureEdit  PictureEdit    protected override void OnMouseWheelMouseEventArgs e        if e.Delta gt 0       this.Properties.ZoomPercent  10     else       this.Properties.ZoomPercent  10     codepre  pSo, this changes the behavior of the codePictureEditcode to zoom on mouse scroll instead of pan. But because Im of the mind to make unit tests, Id like to do so, but I cant figure out how.p  pBehaviorally, I would design my own presenter the unit under test and feed it a dependency injected view as a mock. Then I could use the mock to raise a codeMouseWheelcode event, then assert that the codeZoomPercentcode value was increased or decreased.p  pBy inheriting codePictureEditcode, I dont have a Presenter to unit test or a View to mock. I cant raise the codeOnMouseWheelcode event to test that codeZoomPercentcode gets altered.p  pIs inheriting the codePictureEditcode the proper way to go about this, as shown above And how do I unit test modifications that Ive made to the classp

Negative 83700 pI have a generic error handling function that traps window.onerror and either displays the error on screen as an alert if the code is in devstaging mode, or logs the error message via ajax post in production mode.

In other browsers I am happy to always show the alert ie if not chrome then always alert.p  pSo, can I eitherp  pa detect whether pause on errors is activep  pb detect whether devtools is openp  pc maybe I could make a chrome extension to check if devtools is openp  pAnyone tried something like thisp

Negative 83700 pI recently hit on the idea of using some form of metaprogramming to replace the admittedly limit boilerplate code needed to persist and then load objects using pickle. So youd get something likep  precodeclass MyClassobject      Something to add saveability maybe a decorator or metaclass...      More code...  myinstance  MyClasspathtopersistentfile myinstance.dosomestuff myinstance.save myinstance.dosomemorestuff myinstance.save codepre  pI attemped to accomplish this by using a metaclass. Unfortunately it did not turn out as well as I had hoped. The init methods became complicated because this happensp  ol liThe user calls MyClasspath, otherargs to either open an existing persistent instance or, if none exists at empathem, create a new oneli liThe system finds a file at empathem and calls pickle.load to read itli lipickle.load makes another call to MyClass.init to build the object based on what it read from diskli ol  pMyClass.inits ability to tell 1 from 3 is basically a hack in my implementation. Is there a clean way to do this whether using metaclasses, decorators, or whateverp  pEDIT roippi asked, It sounds like youre trying to reimplement shelve, no Yes, this exercise started as an effort to reimplement shelve, but allowing arbitrary keys, which is basically what my SyncPickleDict is.

Negative 83700 pIm working on a proyect which is divided in two parts. The firs one is some kind of text visualizer in the console wich involves thatthe user can navigate within the text with the arrow keys. p  pnow, i dont have even a clue of how can i solve this, the biggest thing ive done in nasm was a regular expresion analizer, thats all. i imagine that i should display the text but at the end, not give back the control to the OS. the bottom 3 lines, p  precodemov eax, 1 mov ebx, 0  int 80h codepre  pso then i can start capturing the arrow keys. so, if the user press the up arrow key, a pointer moves 80 spaces back in the buffer that contains the text and so on with the rest of the keys. thats for editingp  pi really dont know if this is even possible, but any recomendation or advice or a link to where i can investigate a littlr bit more would be awesomep

When the update is committed, the file pointer is then changed to point to the new file, leaving the old file to be deleted at garbage collection time. This happens at a checkpoint for simple recovery, and at a backup or log backup.emp  pSo have I just got to wait for the garbage collector to remove the chunked files Or should I perhaps be uploading the file somewhere on the file system first and then copying it across p

Negative 83700 pHello I am completely new to programming and am wondering if someone can help me with this. I am creating an app using Google Apps. Is there a way to invoke a handlers function without a user having to interact with a triggerp  pExample. I have an app that requires a date inputs. Once the dates are entered the user presses a button, which invokes the handler, to proceed to the next step by calling on a function.  If I am loading a record from the database that already has a date saved, I would like the button to be hidden and the app to automaticaly proceed to the next step function.p  pI know how to call another function within a function, but I do not know how to pass all the callback elements if the handler is not invoked, so that they can be called on in a manner such asp  pe.parameter.widget1p  pe.parameter.widget2p  pe.parameter.......p  pI figure if I can cause the handler to automatically fire without the user having to press the button this would solve the problem.p

Negative 83700 pI recently migrated our build platform from an ancient one build on top of rake dont ask, seriously to one using msbuild.

I ran my codesvn2git rebasecode against [master], and it updates master as expected but the new branch didnt get converted over.p  pThis makes me question whether or not its updating the existing branches. So, what does svn2git do during coderebasecode, exactly, but more importantly, how can I make sure my branches are getting updated and any new ones are also being convertedp  pIll even settle on how to manually convert or update git branches from svn, as there arent many, but they are important.p

Negative 83700 pIve read through many examples and none seem to address all of my issues. I have a Wordpress generated menu wherein the LI items contain anchor links to content that is controlled with the Data Cycle FX plugin and jQuery. Everything is working as I would like, except that on page refreshload, I would like to detect which LI item is .active, and have that item be centered within the visible area. This is mainly an issue if the page is reloaded, as any li.active that is not one of the first 6 items is hidden. I am thinking that I need to detect the width of the .subnavigation div and somehow use position or offset ... but my attempts have been missing the mark.

Negative 83700 pIm using a hrefhttpwww.digitalgeography.comgeocodinggooglespreadsheetsthesimplerway relnofollowthis scripta to geocode an address column in a Google Spreadsheet. It creates a function getLatLon that takes in the value from the address column. Even though I only have 190 rows, Im quickly reaching the daily geocoding API limit of 2,500. I think this is because the script runs every time the sheet is loaded.p  pI want to make the script run only if an address hasnt been geocoded yet. For this, I tried accessing the value of the cell with the formula to see if its blank. If so, run the geocoder. But its making all my cells, even the geocoded ones, come up blank instead.p  pHeres my code. Im not sure if Im using getValue correctly it returns an empty string if no value, or if the fact that my cell has a formula makes the value nonblank. p  pHow else can you test for a blank value in a cell with a formulap  precodefunction getLatLonaddress    var sh  SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet   var cell  sh.getActiveCell   var value  cell.getValue    if address        Logger.logMust provide an address     return        if value          var geocoder  Maps.newGeocoder     var location     location  geocoder.geocodeaddress     Utilities.sleep2000  Only change cells if geocoder seems to have gotten a  valid response.     if location.status  OK        lat  location[results][0][geometry][location][lat]       lng  location[results][0][geometry][location][lng]       return lat  ,  lng               codepre

Negative 83700 pI have this class emMyClassem that, most often, is created by parsing a string. I cannot trust that this string is always correct and therefore I do not want to put the parsing in the constructor. Hence, I have created a static parsing function that returns true if the string is valid and false if it is invalid. See belowp  precodeclass MyClass  private     Type1 mmemberA     Type2 mmemberB  public             MyClassconst Type1amp parameterA, const Type2amp parameterB           mmemberAparameterA, mmemberBparamterB      static bool parseconst stdstringamp input, MyClass  result              Type1 paramA         Type2 paramB          Parse input and get values for paramA and paramB.         Return false if the input is invalid.          MyClass tempparamA, paramB         result  temp         return true       codepre  pMy intent was to use it as followsp  precodevoid myFunctionconst stdstringamp input       MyClass  myObject  NULL      ifMyClassparseinput, myObject                 Use myObject for something            else                 Log invalid input string        codepre  pNow, this crashes at run time. And I figured that is because I am trying to dereference a NULLpointer, which obviously doesnt work. But my question is, how would you solve this problem Or rather, what is best practice for solving something like thisp

Negative 83700 pIm having the following issue with SpriteKit.

Its toggling...p  pThe weird thing is that when the scene unfreezes I can see that animations continued in the background as the sprites are in different positions than they where before the freeze.p  pTo make things weirder, it only happens when testing in the actual device, not in the simulator.p  pI saw this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23358802iadsandspritekitskscenefreezeonfullscreenexitondeviceonlyiAds and SpriteKit SKScene Freeze on fullscreen exit on device onlya but it has no answer and the problem is when using iAds.

Negative 83700 pI have a fragment color which is the result of 4 different draws, each painting a different color. I have C1C2C3C4CR using a glBlendFuncGLSRCALPHA,GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA. This is perfectly fine and correct.p  pSuppose I only have the red and alpha channels, if my 4 writes are 0.1,0.4,0.6,0.3,0.1,0.4,0.6,0.3 the resulting color will be 0,313,0.3574, since 0.1,0.40.6,0.30.25,0.37 using the above blend function, blending then 0.1,0.4 will result in 0.19,0.382 and after the final 0.6,0.3 we have 0.313,0.3574.p  pNow the rendering code changed for RTT and I have two distinct textures, one with C1C2 and the other with C3C4 always using glBlendFuncGLSRCALPHA,GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA. Blending the two textures together using the same blending function obviously yelds to a different CR. Seems like I cant figure out how to achieve the same CR color, splitting the rendering in 2 textures. I tried several configurations on paper but I cant find a proper formula to get the same value.p  pUsing the above example, in both textures I have 0.1,0.40.6,0.3  0.25,0.37 with the same blending function. Blending two 0.25,0.37 using that function will not result in 0.313,0.3574, which is the value I want to achieve.p

Negative 83700 pI have some memory leaks and I not quite sure what is causing it, but after some testing, it seems like i screw up at copying my object and its not released properly. Let me tell you first that Im using ARC and not so long ago i didnt know much about copies or advance memory management so there still is a lot to learn for me. Ok lets throw in some details, I have 2 classes Tree and TreeCell.p  pTreep  precodeinterface Tree  NSObjectltNSCopyinggt  Here we have 2D array that stores pointers to TreeCell objects property retain,nonatomicNSMutableArray tree  pointersToTree stores copied pointers from tree,  its the same in terms of content but it have different order of rows and columns property retain,nonatomicNSMutableArray pointersToTree  i dont believe delegate is relevant to my problems since its not copied property weak,nonatomic idlttreeDelagategtdelagate  codepre  pSo in short Tree stores 2 the same pointers to each create TreeCell, one of those in each array.p  pTreeCellp  precodeinterface TreeCell  NSObjectltNSCopyinggt  ancestors and children stores arrays made of 2 NSNubers  property retain,nonatomicNSMutableArray  ancestors property retain,nonatomicNSMutableArray  children  property retain,nonatomicNSNumber boardY property retain,nonatomicNSNumber boardX ... there are some more Integers and Booleans codepre  pAnd here is how copy functions looks like, they are both working but im not sure if they are implemented correctly, so starting with Treep  precodeid copyWithZone NSZone  zone     Tree copy  [[Tree allocWithZone zone] init]      this array will become copy of self.tree     NSMutableArray copyOfTree[[NSMutableArray alloc]init]      loop to go thru all stored TreeCell pointers in self.tree     for NSInteger a0 altself.tree.count a       adding row         [copyOfTree addObject[[NSMutableArray alloc]init]]          for NSInteger b0 blt[self.tree[a] count] b              creating copy of TreeCell and storing pointer to it             [copyOfTree[a] addObject[TreeCellself.tree[a][b] copy]]                   copy.treecopyOfTree     by now we copied whole self.tree and since i have function to create pointersToTree out of it I call it below     [copy creatArryOfPointerRowsself.pointersToTree.count columns[self.pointersToTree[0]count]]      return copy   codepre  pSo what Im trying to get here is deep copy of Tree. Ok here is TreeCell copy functionp  precodeid copyWithZone NSZone  zone      we start here by allocating and setting NSNubers boardY and boardX     TreeCell copy  [[TreeCell allocWithZone zone] initWithLayerself.layer boardXself.boardX andBoardYself.boardY]      after that some integers and booleans are set     copy.helperself.helper     copy.inTreeself.inTree     copy.stableConnectedself.stableConnected     copy.positonself.positon     copy.freeStoregself.freeStoreg      here we are adding arrays containg 2 NSNumbers     for int a0 altself.ancestors.count a          [copy addAncestorWithXself.ancestors[a][0] andYself.ancestors[a][1]]          for int a0 altself.children.count a          [copy addChildWithXself.children[a][0] andYself.children[a][1]]            return copy   codepre  pTo make things clear here is addAncestor function addChildren looks the samep  precodevoid addAncestorWithXNSNumberancestorX andYNSNumberancestorY     if [self.ancestors indexOfObject[NSArray arrayWithObjectsancestorX,ancestorY, nil]]NSIntegerMax      [self.ancestors addObject[NSMutableArray arrayWithObjectsancestorX,ancestorY, nil]]      codepre  pFinally this piece of code that creates memory leakp  precodefor NSInteger a0 alt8000 a           Tree testTree [self.startingTree copy]  codepre  pAt the end of each cycle of this loop testTree should be released, after testing Im 100 sure that dealloc for it is called and its also called for each TreeCell that was stored in tree. But memory usage is constantly increasing. Please tell me where did i go wrong. Some paraboly go and say try serializing it but it doesnt cut it for my.p

Negative 83700 pIm sure this seems like a simple question but I cant seem to find the answer anywhere.  Ive been playing with basic clientserver code in C, basically the same stuff thats posted on any intro socket programming guide, and no matter how I vary the few lines of code I cant connect two machines over the internet.  I can connect locally with 127.0.0.1 and all the examples work fine, but I want to be able to connect two separate hosts.p  pIve tried using IP addresses  ifconfig and curl ifconfig.me return different IPs for every machine or remote box I have access to and Ive been told this means theyre all behind NAT which means I cant connect with an explicit IP.p  pIve tried using usernamehostname with gethostbyname  Ive been using whoami and hostname on the serving machine to determine the hostname the client should use, however the DNS always returns an error.  How should I determine the hostname I should supply to the client so that I can connectp  pOther than that Im not sure what the issue could be because Im using the same socket code posted all over the web and Ive checked every line many times against several different examples.  This has been frustrating me for a long time, any help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 83700 pI have on hand, a program such that it records input via mic source, this source is then stored in a temporary folder, called recording.pcm in the sdcard directory.

Negative 83700 pI am in the process of developing a new website for a University Library.  It will include a feature to display the hours open on any given day.  A lot of libraries do this using some combination of PHP and a backend database or Google Calendar Integration.  For a variety of reasons we cannot do that so Ive opted to use Javascript as it is known to work with our CMS WordPress without me having to bother the campus webmaster.  p  pMy initial approach was to use several different files, each with a switch statement to display hours based on the day of the week.  We have 3 types of hours regular, exam week, and intercession and only one location.  Nevertheless having to swap files introduces a degree of human error.  p  pThus I decided to use one file.  The approach which makes most sense is to get the date, format it like monthnumber of week in the month first second, third, etcdate and use a series of if ... else statements to compare the current date to that and then run a switch statement to pick out the correct hours for the current day of the week.p  pProblem is the conditional in the first if statement keeps evaluating as true even when its not.  Can anybody tell me what Ive done wrong  Or is there a better approach to this task  p  pHere is my code p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netmjcodelib9aKmC relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netmjcodelib9aKmCap

Id like to have two controllers, one for an event page and one for an event details page.

Negative 83700 pI started my first web project using JSF, Hibernate and Spring and I would like to know if the architecture that I designed is the most appropriate.

Negative 83700 ptoday I started deal with concurrency in Java probably that was bad idea...p  pI read some articles about it. At the beginning I understood it but now I am confused...p  pIm going straight to the point. Suppose we have this classp  precodepublic class Test implements ActionListener      private boolean bool      public void process              if bool              ...          return bool           Override     public void actionPerformedActionEvent e               We can suppose that this method belongs to JButton or so...          And if I am not wrong then this method is fired in EDT, so it means it runs in          other thread Event Dispatch Thread in contrast with this class... So there are          two threads...          bool  ...  true  false            ...  codepre  pMy confusionp  pIn strongactionPerformedstrong we modify the value of property strongboolstrong and in the same time we can access the property inside strongprocessstrong again if I am not wrong... For me it seems that there can occur to some error or so... My solution is that property strongboolstrong should be strongvolatilestrong or method strongprocessstrong should be tagged as strongsynchronizedstrong and statement p  precodebool  ...  true  false codepre  pshould be asp  precodesynchronized this      bool  ...  true  false  codepre  pThis is little primitive example, but we can consider strongboolstrong property as Object, String, etc... and in strongactionPerformedstrong we will set it to null and in process will be thrown a NullPointerException for example... p  pWhat you think I want to know why anyone use synchronizing inside listeners... I have not found anyone...p  pThanksp  pRegards brolinkop  pstrongEDIT 1strong strongprocessstrong is never called within EDT... When I create an instance of Test for example in strongmainstrong method then the instance runs inside a thread as main and in main I can call the process ... So there are two threads in this case if I am not wrong...p

I really love the design but i cant fix this issue by changing the image.p  pSo if you look in the image you will see a white background around the text, now it is readable. I would like it this way for all buttons even when the mouse is not hovering over the button.p  pBonus fix It would be nice to then maybe implement another hover.p  pExtra info Reason i need to do fix this in the code is because i am working with opencart and want the client to keep the option of adding, removing or moving links in the menu.p  pLINK a hrefhttpimgur.comowmuTyE relnofollowhttpimgur.comowmuTyEap  pI think this can be solved by using CSS but i cant figure out the way of approaching this problem.p  pEdit instead of downvoting why not explain an approach, i do not neccesarely need code. But here is the code, its a simple opencart menu.

Negative 83700 pIm encountering a problem on Reporting Services, using BIDS 2008.p  pI need to create a report which has a transparent body background. I mean, when I export it TIFF or PNG, whatever, I need the whole background to be transparent.p  pWhen I edit my report, I check that the Body  BackgroundColor is set to No color putting Transparent as a value automatically brings it back to No color.p  pBut once my report is deployed and I generate it through the Reporting Services web interface, exporting it to TIFF format only gives me a report ... with a white background.p  pSo here is my question  is it a wellknown issue  Is there a way to get my body background transparent  Maybe an easy way exists and Im just missing it, but I have no idea what Im doing wrong.p

Negative 83700 pToday is my first day using SQLite. I am using Java to interact with an SQLite database that contains fields called ID, NAME, CITY.

Negative 83700 pI have a small problem at the moment. The problem is that my web service is RESTful. Consequently, I need a stateless session for Spring Security in order not to break REST conception. I want to get the current user information and since my Spring Security session is stateless I dont know how. I also wanted to use PreAuthorized annotations, but, now, its impossible too for the reasons, I wrote above. Honestly, Im new to REST services and I would be grateful for a piece of advice. Thank you in advance.p

Negative 83700 pSo I am working on a project to generate documents using LaTeX, the program is supposed to ask for some inputs and then compile the .tex and get a .pdf.p  pThe problem is that if I use QProcess to compile the .tex using terminal commands, LaTeX must be installed on the PC to work. So I was wondering if theres a way to include LaTeX in my app so I can compile .tex files without installing LaTeX on every PC. And how LaTeX online editors compile .texp
Negative 83700 pI am using the FriendBuy app for a shopify store at this moment and am running into an issue where an illegal token is being caught, aside from that there are no other issues that I can see. What I am trying to do is activate the referral via a text link. I have followed the documentation according to the app to the letter, but after running a javascript validation test on the code a number of errors popped up. I find it hard to believe an expensive app with a huge user base would fail on something simple so the issue must be on my end but I cant seem to discover where. The code creating the issue isp  precode       window[friendbuy].push[widget, xxxxx, configuration sharebuttonfalse] codepre  paccording to the documentation this is what i should use, replacing xxxxxx with the campaign id. The only inconsistency I can see is that the suggested xs to fill are 5 characters long, where the actual code is 6, but that is what I came up with after following the documentation.p

Negative 83700 pIm somewhat new to PowerShell, but can do some things. I have to monitor a website thats hosted on a 2008r2 server. Ive found scripts online that might work for a regular site. In my case I need to monitor a website that requires user authentication from a domain user and I have an account I can use, although encrypting the creds would be great The next trick which I havent figure out how to do is after a user logs into the website they are on a landing page. Next they have to click a tablink at the top of the page to get to the web page which is actually failing. Its a homegrown app that was just developed. It appears like its an asp type error, but I need to monitor further to then gather data to troubleshoot. The web group cant assist with this it seems.... Im enjoying learning anyway, can anyone help mep

Negative 83700 pI have a question. How do I use the VLookUp feature to transfer colours and not values. For example if I have a row with the row name as colours on column A and I input different cell colours in the same row, from columns B E . How do I make it that if I type colours somewhere else, I want the same sequence of colours to follow it. In other words, VLookUp usually does that for values. But how do I do it for colours The thing is that there are many rows like that. not just one row colours.. but like colours 1, colours 2. so I need it to recognize from what I input and give me the corresponding colours p  pAny help would be deeply appreciated Thanks p

Sadly this application is only supported in the IE browser but its only happening in IE11 version, in IE10 this works as expected.p  pIm not sure how an onLoad can trigger, and then the onError be trigger right after when the onLoad has found the image from the src.p  pSECOND EDITp  pAs the comment below shot Im not able to reproduce this in a jfiddle on IE11. This could be because of different things my code is trying to do at the same time, but is there any way to see why the onerror handler was trigger I tried printing out the src of the Image item but that doesnt seem to be the issue as both onError and onLoad return the same src, and the image is clearly there.

Negative 83700 pI am trying to write a .tgz file containing tens if not hundreds of thousands of file entries, the contents of each of which have come from a string in a database. Each file entry is about 25k of data.p  pI want to avoid doing this without having to write the files out first. Currently I have PHP creating a traditional directory structure, writing files, then making a tgz from that at the very end using a shellexec.p  pThe disk we are using is slow and so writing tens of thousands of files is taking ages. Even running a prototype on another machine with a fast disk using a tmpfs ramdisk and lots of CPU, I get a rate of about 100200 file entries per second, which feels slow  half an hour for 150,000 files in a directory structure. Once that has been written, the actual conversion from the native OS directory structure to tgz is not problematic.p  pI was hoping to use PharData to do the writing. However, PharDataaddFromString seems to do a file write as soon as the file is added, rather than an an OpenAddWriteout pattern.p  pCan anyone suggest any strategies herep  pThe eventual tgz file is then to be made available for download, and will not be refreshed often. But because there are a series of these files to be created, having to wait 3060 minutes just to package it becomes quite a blocker.p

Negative 83700 pIm trying to create a codePSCustomObjectcode from a robocopy log file. The first piece is pretty easy but Im struggling with the codeFootercode part. I cant seem to find a good way to split up the values. p  pIt would be nice if every entry has its own codePropertycode, so its possible to use for example codeTotal.Dirscode or codeSkipped.Dirscode. I was thinking about codeImportCSVcode, because thats just great on how it allows you to have column headers. But this doesnt seem to fit here.

Negative 83700 pThis is a difficult issue but Im not sure where to turn. To sum it up from the start, Im having trouble with arrays in c. To head off your inevitable response, I have to use arrays, I cant use vectors. The reason being that I will eventually be interfacing this with CUDA which cant accept vectors.p  pAnyway, I have written my own class to handle 2D arrays and all the stuff that goes with that behind the scenes. The header file is reproduced at the bottom of this question. I use this class to define a 6 x 10 array. I then loop over many items, primarily using the add method of my class. At some point in this complicated loop, the size of my array switches from 6 x 10 to 0 x 1074266112. I have tried to debug my code and figure out what the issue is but for the life of me I cannot find the issue.p  pIve printed out all the values at the moment the array size changes, and none of them are out of the norm and Im never trying to index the array outside of the 6x10 size. In fact, it never even happens at the same point of the loop, it just seems to happen randomly for each run. The only constant I can find between each issue is that the new array size is always exactly 0 x 1074266112.p  pSorry I cant provide a minimum working example, but this issue only crops up in my large program and I cant reproduce it in a smaller program.

Negative 83700 pI am currently working on a small data reporting application. The idea behind it is to be able to import data from a specific location be it a flat file or a remote database and report on that data e.g. strongSalesstrong following specific dimensions e.g. Sales by strongregionstrong, by strongproductstrong, by strongcustomerstrong. At first when I built it, I created a Sales model with these dimensions as FKs to other models a Region model, a Product model, a Customer model. The reporting aspect of the application is simply a bunch of requests on that table ending up in chartsthis works fine.p  pNow lets say I want to deployscale this application to multiple users each user would have its own dataset, e.g. User A wants to report on Sales by region, product and customer while User B wants to report on Production volumes by product, by plant and by month.

Negative 83700 pI have codeActivity1code which is a list screen of items. Each item can be viewed in a separate codeActivity2code which is displayed as a popup. codeActivity1code can be launched from the background and displayed even when the screen is locked. codeActivity1code may also choose to automatically display the contents of an item in the list screen by starting codeActivity2code. We can bypass the lock screen because both activities have the codeWindowManagerFlags.DismissKeyguardcode enabled in the codeOnCreatecode method.p  pBefore Android Lollipop everything worked as expected. But now the popup codeActivity2code is not visible unless the device is manually unlocked. If I change codeActivity2code to be a full screen codeActivitycode then everything seems to work Except transitioning from one activity to another will briefly display the lock screen. Any ideas on how to fix this cleanlyp  pAlso, I have only tried the Galaxy S6S6 Edge devices which have this new Knox security feature on them.p  pstrongEditstrong I have changed codeActivity2code to be a codeDialogFragmentcode instead of an codeActivitycode. This worked for me best because the suggested answer used code that is deprecated or obsolete depending on the target sdk. codeActivity1code is using the following flags to bypass the lock screen when needed.p  precodegetWindow.addFlagsLayoutParams.FLAGDISMISSKEYGUARD getWindow.addFlagsLayoutParams.FLAGSHOWWHENLOCKED codepre  pSince codeActivity2code is now just a codeDialogFragmentcode, it uses the window flags of the parent codeActivity1code. I also remove those flags on the emandroid.intent.action.SCREENOFFem action so that the activity bypasses the lock screen only when launched as a notification and not every time the activity is at the top of the stack. Permissions mentioned in the answer are required.p

Negative 83700 pThis seems like it would be a reasonably common issue, but Ive been unable to find a clear answer, so here goesp  pI have two processes running on Windows Server 2008 x64. Both processes are 64bit.  Process A is run by a user with Administrator role, Process B is run by a user with Standard role. p  pProcess B tries to get a list of the dlls loaded by Process A by calling CreateToolhelp32Snapshot with the TH32CSSNAPMODULE flag and the pid of Process A.p  pThe call to CreateToolhelp32Snapshot fails with error code 183 and GetLastError gives me Cannot create a file when that file already exists.p  pIs this simply a permissions problem because Process B is not running as admin  In this case I would have expected the ACCESSDENIED error.  If anyone can shed any light on the reason for this error, andor suggest a solution or workaround, it would be much appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 83700 pI have 2 business entities objects Product and Order. The Product object contains a Name property in addition to some other properties. The Order entity contains Id, Date ... etc properties in addition to a property that points to Product assuming that an order can have only one product for the sake of simplicityp  pIn my case, when I want to show a list of orders, I want to show the name of the product for each order but I dont need to show the other products properties.p  pMy question is, when I design the Order entity class, should I add a property that points to Product, or I should simply add a property called ProductName And if the answer is to add a property that points to Product, is it ok to load only the Name property or I should fill all ther other properties as well at the time of retrieving data from DBp  pI would also appreciate it if you can add links to some articles with your answers.p

But if the queue is too long, return some invalid statements. I have already created service contract 2 and 3 where contract 2 handles multiple request and contract 3 handles one request at a time. The basic problem with this approach will be, if the queue get long enough, the users may face time execution error since there will be no response from the server.p

Ive tried to find a way to do this using the lowlevel API TransportProtocols but the limited asyncio docsexamples online all seem to go into the high level API  using streams, etc. Would someone be able to point me in the right direction on how to implement thisp  pHeres the server codep  precodeusrbinenv python3  import asyncio import json   class SubscriberServerProtocolasyncio.Protocol      A Server Protocol listening for subscriber messages       def connectionmadeself, transport          Called when connection is initiated           self.peername  transport.getextrainfopeername         printconnection from .formatself.peername         self.transport  transport      def datareceivedself, data          The protocol expects a json message containing         the following fields              type       subscribeunsubscribe             channel    the name of the channel          Upon receiving a valid message the protocol registers         the client with the pubsub hub.

Negative 83700 pI am aware that you can use netfilter to filter out packets based on address, protocol, and other things.  My question is can you use netfilter or some other native Linux utility that will allow you to filter packets based on content.   The filtering should be done on the client side, which is running linux with root access.p  pFor example for purposes of this discussion, lets say I would like to DROP all incoming UDP packets that have the word porn in the body of the packet assume no compression, no ssl, and we are only trying to catch packets with this word in ASCIIplaintext in body of packet.  Is there a way to create a iptable, netfilter, related rule to drop these incoming UDP packetsp

Negative 83700 pTo Start with I am a beginner in coding and especially in Spring MVC. I am working on a spring MVC application. I have got a Login page. On typing the username and password and Clicking Login the execution takes to the corresponding controller class where my Login form gets processed. I have set an infinite Loop in my controller class for testing ,so that after submitting my Login form my login page loads for an infinite time. So this is actually the loading of the next supposed to be displayed screen which never stops.p  pNow my problem is this. While the next page is being loaded for ever , I kill my serverJBoss. The loading still continues infinitely. I am using HttpServletRequest and response in my Controller. So I guess that in my case my server gets killed when my request is being processed. I want to set some kind of time out such that it loads for a given timesay 15 mins and after that it breaks from the infinite loopor any other operation which is being performed in case of a dead server.p  pI did some research and came up with Spring RestTemplate. I tried adding time out using the below code to my springservlet.xml. But I am not sure if this will works. p  precodeltbean classorg.springframework.web.client.RestTemplategt ltconstructorarggt     ltbean classorg.springframework.http.client.HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory         preadTimeout2000         pconnectTimeout2000 gt ltconstructorarggt ltbeangt codepre  pI want to know if there is any other possible way to set time out for HttpRequest or achieve this scenario I would also like to know if someone has had any success trying with RestTemplate.

Negative 83700 pEDIT in the printtables function, i have the forloop that fills all the values accordingly. What wrong with it is that im trying to calculate the values for each element, however there getting filled with the wrong input. The vars elasticity and numOfDimples are correct, however for the var distance and its calculation is wrong. For the calculation p  precode            dimpleFactor  120  numOfDimples             distance  elasticity  800  dimpleFactor  dimpleFactor codepre  pits multiplying the end result of elasticity rather than multiply it accordingly. for examplep  plets say elasticity  0.14 and numOfDimples  102. so when the forloop gets executed for the first time around what happens is elasticity  1.12 the last value of elasticity, so this will pretty much ruin the equation. p  pHeres the code in full, any suggestions to fixing it will really be appreciated.

Negative 83700 pIm using Ionic to develop a scan application to validate tickets at events. Since their are usually large cues, the focus of the app is speed. Im using a hrefhttpsgithub.comphonegapphonegappluginbarcodescanner relnofollowBarcodeScanner plugina for Cordova. Out of the box, a scan action opens the camera, scans a code, closes the camera, and then gives me the code. Since opening and closing the camera takes up time, I would like to change this plugin to keeping the camera open, and having a popup on top of the camera feed when a code is scanned.p  pI know I probably have to change the source files of the plugin, but I have no idea where to start. Maybe someone else has experience with thisp  pAny other free Cordova plugin which supports this is fine too. Or maybe use a Barcode Scanner written in JS, like a hrefhttpsserratus.github.ioquaggaJS relnofollowQuaggaJSa How would I implement this in my Ionic app Because I figure Ill need to have camera access permission.p

Negative 83700 pI am new to C MVC and I have a big form to build. The form is to createedit an instance of my main model AcModel and it is spanning on several tabs all of them being in the same view. It contains several Telerik grids that are filled using different models each one representing a table in the database.p  pSo when the user clicks on the button to get to the next tab I want to trigger validation for the piece of form he just entered. In one of the grids the user can add, update or remove data from another model. So when he clicks on the button to submit a line in the grid, an action from my controller is called with that model as an argument. But I dont want to call the service to update the db at this point because I first need the id of my main object being created by the form.p  pFor those grids whose selected values cant be bound directly to a field from my main model, I want to update the model if it passes validation as the user goes to the next tab, and only when he reaches the end of the form and submits it do I want to call the service and update the db for every field in my form.p  pSo here it is how can I access my main model from its controller  I could serialize it to Json from the view and pass it to the controller via the ViewBag and return it from my action but the returned view does not contain the inputs from the user and thats dirty and there must be a simplercleaner way.p  pHere is my grid in the view ViewsAcACForm.cshtmlp  precodeHtml.Kendo.GridltErakis.Domain.PerimetreProduit.Models.ListeAcPprModelgt   .Namegridacppr   .DataSourceds gt ds       .Ajax       .Modelm gt m.Idp gt p.LacID       .PageSize10       .Eventse gt e.Errorerrorhandler       .Createupdate gt update.ActionAcPprCreate, Ac       .Readread gt read.ActionAcPprRead, Ac, new  IdAC  Model.AcID        .Updateupdate gt update.ActionAcPprUpdate, Ac       .Destroyupdate gt update.ActionAcPprDestroy, Ac   .Columnsc gt          c.ForeignKeyp gt p.PprID, ListltListePprModelgtViewBag.PPRs, PprId, PprLibelle       c.Boundp gt p.QteMin       c.Boundp gt p.CAMin       c.Commandcommand gt  command.Edit command.Destroy       .ToolBart gt t.Create   .Filterable   .Editableeditable gt editable.ModeGridEditMode.InLine codepre  pHere is the model used to fill my gridp  precodepublic class ListeAcPprModel      public int LacID  get set      public Nullableltintgt PprID  get set      public Nullableltintgt AcoID  get set      public Nullableltintgt QteMin  get set      public Nullableltdecimalgt CAMin  get set      public Nullableltboolgt IsExclusion  get set      public Nullableltintgt TypePerimetre  get set   codepre  pAnd part of my main model AcModelp  precodepublic class AcModel      ...     public virtual ICollectionltListeAcPprModelgt ACPPRMODELs  get set   codepre  pHere is a typical action in my controller ControllersAcController.csp  precode[HttpPost] public async TaskltActionResultgt AcPprUpdate[DataSourceRequest] DataSourceRequest Request, ListeAcPprModel AcPpr      if AcPpr  null ampamp ModelState.IsValid               Here I want to update one of the items in the property ACPPRMODELs of AcModel, which is an ICollection, with the AcPpr that I got from the view          return Jsonnew[]  AcPpr .ToDataSourceResultRequest, ModelState  codepre  pThank you very much for your helpp

Negative 83700 pI asked a more generic question yesterday and done some work based on this.  This question is more to the point in regards to something I am trying to work out.p  pSo my application has a departments table to handle departments.  So I am able to make different departments within my application such as Marketing and Finance. p  pThe problem is, I know what departments I need to make, and these will be created beforehand but I have made it like a CMS so an admin can edit departments etc.  With the departments created, I envision something like this a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comskHRf.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comskHRf.jpg altenter image description hereap  pSo a user can choose the department from a dropdown remember, this is after departments are created.  When they do this, the document dropdown should populate.p  pThis is my problem, how can I associate specific documents to a department  Each document requires different inputs, so I would imagine they need to be different tables  At the moment I have a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comrOEYN.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrOEYN.png altenter image description hereap  pBut this doesnt really solve my problem whereby I can state that the Marketing department has a Brief document and Overview document.p  pHow could I go about doing this seeing that I do not specifically have a table for each department  Would I need to create one for each departmentp  pThanksp

Negative 83700 pI have a little problem with form data caching keeping it in a variable before its actually saved to a file. I have a pretty simple form layout  p  ol liObjectComboli liParamCombo1li liParamCombo2li liParamText1li liParamCombo3li liSaveButtonli ol  pThis form is meant to configure certain parameters for specific objects in my program. The list of all the objects is in the ObjectCombo. And the parameters are in the other form fields. Whenever I pick another object from the ObjectCombo I want the parameters entered for that object to be cached until I have configured every object in the ObjectCombo list. After everything is configured Id like to press the SaveButton so that every cached parameter for every object in ObjectCombo gets saved at once.p  pMy solution this far is that I created a Dictionary with int index of the object in the ObjectCombo as key and another dictionary with parameter name as key and parameter value as value.br    codeDictionaryltint, Dictionaryltstring, stringgtgtcode  p  pI will do the caching in ObjectCombo SelectedIndexChanged event and thus when I have configured the last element and clicked Save the last element does not get saved because no SelectedIndexChanged event was fired. Of course I could go back to a different object in ObjectCombo and that would solve the problem but thats not user friendly. Is there a different event I could subscribe to that lets me cache the config data before moving to a different objectp  pIs my approach to this challenge even reasonable Ive messed around with this problem for a day and everything Ive done sounds so simple but since English is not my native language I might have a problem articulating myself. If anyone interested in helping is having problems understanding what Im trying to achieve dont hesitate to ask more information.    p

Negative 83700 pIve been tasked to maintain and expand a codebase that heavily rest on Celery. This code needs to distribute several complex tasks, taking quite a long time each. Tasks were not designed as function, but directly as classes inheriting from Celery.p  pHowever, when you extend the task class from celery, your workers will create one and only one instance of the class, meaning that you severely pollute self. The previous developers found a clever solution involving metaclasses to avoid this behaviour and create a new instance each time a task need to be run. This is efficient, but the result gives a code that is rather hard to read and debug, and that strays far away from classical celery usages. Im also afraid it will prevent us from upgrading our versions of celery if new versions of celery make extensive changes.p  pI have the opportunity to refactor this code, but Im not sure if I should. The only solution I can think of is to transform the current Task classes into helper classes, and put the tasks themselves in simple functions that instantiate those helper classes and do the hard work. Are there any patterns to do this, or celery functionalities that I missed for this situation p  pN.B. this is pure celery, there is no Django in the mixp

Negative 83700 pI am generating a data set where I first want to randomly draw a number for each observation from a discrete distribution, fill in codevar1code with these numbers. Next, I want to draw another number from the distribution for each row, but the catch is that the number in codevar1code for this observation is not eligible to be drawn anymore. I want to repeat this a relatively large number of times.p  pTo hopefully make this make more sense, suppose that I start withp  precodeid 1 2 3 ... 999 1000 codepre  pSuppose that the distribution I have is [A, B, C, D, E] that happen with probability [.2, .3, .1, .15, .25].p  pI would first like to randomly draw from this distribution to fill in codevarcode. Suppose that the result of this isp  precodeid    var1 1     E 2     E 3     C ...    999   B 1000  A codepre  pNow codeEcode is not eligible to be drawn for observations code1code and code2code. codeCcode, codeBcode, and codeAcode are ineligible for observations code3code, code999code, and code1000code, respectively.p  pAfter all the columns are filled in, we may end up with thisp  precodeid    var1  var2  var3  var4  var5 1     E     C     B     A     D 2     E     A     B     D     C 3     C     B     A     E     D ...         999   B     D     C     A     E 1000  A     E     B     C     D codepre  pI am not sure of how to approach this in Stata. But one way to fill in codevar1code is to do something likep  precodegen random1  runiform replace var1  A if random1lt.2 replace var1  B if random1gt.2 amp random1lt.5 etc.... codepre  pNote that sticking with the scaled probabilities after creating codevar1code is desirable, but is not required for me.p
