Positive 1090 pI have written a balanced symbol checker with stacks. Everything else works and I have fully tested all functions like pop push destroy isempty.

When I try to print our the input[10] char array my program just crashes aswell.p

For example If I am to enter in  as input, the  is pushed ontop of the stack, however it does not check if the stack is empty at all after the while loop. I have tried moving the isEmpty evaluation outside the while loop to see if that was the problem, but it behaves the same. Basically, no matter what I enter, the expression is regarded as balanced, so it seems to me that my conditionals are wrong, however I cant figure out what to do from here.p

Positive 1090 pTwo hours ago I thought I had full understanding of how the stack works at least how its handled in C. But Ive come to notice some unexpected to me behaviour in my programs.p  pWe know the stack grows towards lower memory addresses Im talking about PCs, in my case Intel 64 bits, Ubuntu. So when a new stack frame is created, the objects that belong to that frame have lower memory addresses that all the previous ones. What surprised me is this the objects within a frame have higher memory addresses the later they where declared. This shocked me quite a bit because I thought variables that were declared earlier earned higher memory addresses.p  pLet me show what exactly what I mean with an example in C.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  void foo      int firstVar  1     int secondVar  2     printffirstVar is at pn, ampfirstVar     printfsecondVar is at pn, ampsecondVar   int mainvoid      int mainVar  0     printfmainVar is at pn, ampmainVar     foo     return 0  codepre  pAfter compiling with gcc g, ansi and pedantic flags the output isp  precodemainVar is at 0x7ffd1ec0fadc firstVar is at 0x7ffd1ec0fab8 secondVar is at 0x7ffd1ec0fabc codepre  pAs expected, emmainVarem has a higher memory address than the ones in the emfooem stack frame. However, emfirstVarem has a lower memory address than emsecondVarem even though is was declared before. Looking at the disassembling of emfooem shows this behaviourp  precode0x000000000040052d lt0gt    push   rbp 0x000000000040052e lt1gt    mov    rsp,rbp 0x0000000000400531 lt4gt    sub    0x10,rsp 0x0000000000400535 lt8gt    movl   0x1,0x8rbp 0x000000000040053c lt15gt   movl   0x2,0x4rbp ... codepre  pThe 1 is put four bytes before the 2, showing once again that emfirstVarem has a lower memory address than emsecondVarem.p  pMy question is why is that According to all the bibliography Ive read, objects within the same stack frame should have higher memory addresses the earlier they where declared. And bibliography means internet this site for example and reputable books. Im using a very standard system so I doubt any ELF or ABI weird stuff is going on...p  pAny ideas Thanks for reading through.p

Positive 1090 pI found this link describing interrupts and how a CPU manages them.p  pa hrefhttpwww.ni.comwhitepaper2874en relnofollowhttpwww.ni.comwhitepaper2874enap  pI remember from my studies in computerscience that when an interrupt occurrs the cpu saves whats in its registers and stores that in a PCB process controll block that belongs to the actual process.p  pBut in this article one can read the followingp  pemAn interrupt is a special input to the processor. When the processor is signalled that an interrupt has occurred, the processor finishes the instruction currently being executed and saves the instruction pointer and a status word to the stack. The stack is a special block of memory used to keep track of information during function calls and interrupts. The processor uses a special register called the stack pointer to keep track of the location of the top of the stack, which is where the last item was added to the stack.em p  pSo here the context seem to be saved to the stack instead, not the PCB.p  pSo  whats the answer to this Does it just differs between different systems and architectures p  pembefore downwoting or closing this question  give me a chance to migrate the question to another forum. I choosed stackoverflow since others seem to miss appropriate tags for the questionemp

Positive 1090 pI want to fill an arraybased stack that takes void by default with sizet, and have the values those pointers point to match the i variable in a loop.

Therefore, I thought of creating them, allocating memory and setting their values within a loop.

Positive 1090 pI am writing a program that is to convert infix to postfix and calculate the expression. For conversion I am using a linklist stack. The one problem I am having with the project is the fact that the stack heads can only be declared locally. The stack heads are a pointer to my stack struct that point to the first value in the link list stack. My linked list stack struct is globally declared.p  pSo for example,p  precodeint evaluateparam1,param2 declare my 1st stack head here declare my 2nd stack head here.  codepre  pI am using 2 stacks, 1 for value inputs and 1 for the characteroperation inputs. I am just getting confused on how to access these stacks outside of the evaluate function. My instructor was hinting that we needed to use double pointer notation in calling other functions, I sort of understand the idea but would love if anyone could explain further.p  precodeIf I have a function  popstackstackhow do i call this parameter is it stack stack   or ampstack codepre  pBasically I am confused on how to go about the pointer notation, whether it be pointer to pointer, or the adress of the pointer. p
Positive 1090   pGreetings everyone,p  pI am developing a strategy game in C and while I was working on UI behaviour, I thought about a construction that allows code being written like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeThis is running in a parallel thread.  Vector2 targetPosition  UI.ChoosePosition waits for position being picked tank.GoTotargetPosition instructs the tank to go to that position codepre  pThe code above is running in a seperate thread than the main UpdateDraw loop. For clarity I will call the thread with the UpdateDraw loop the main thread, and the thread that runs the above code will be called parallel thread It is never actually run simultaneously to the main thread  a construction of semaphores allows me to give the control to the parallel thread and back to the main thread as soon as the parallel thread is waiting. As long as the parallel thread is working, the main thread is waiting.p  pThe current thread stops when ChoosePosition is called and continues when a position is picked and the main thread allows it to continue running. All this works great, and I am quite content how clean the code looks. You can simply read it from top to bottom, which is far worse when such behaviour is programmed into an Update method that runs in a loop.p  pYou see that I dont actually need threads for this  I just want to have multiple stacks at once. The part about threads that cares about speeding up programs through parallel code execution is irrelevant for me. I guess that this causes some overhead, as I have to wait for the OS to switch to the parallel thread and back. I am not quite sure how much overhead though.p  pNow I thought about using a similar construction for unit behaviour, which would allow me to write code of similar cleanness, e. g. like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeShooting behaviour of the tank. Again, this is running in a parallel, but synchronized thread. whiletarget.IsAlive ampamp tank.IsDisrupted      tank.TurnTurrettargetDirection suspends current thread until turret is turned correctly     tank.WaitForShotReady suspends thread again     tank.Shoot     soundSystem.StartSoundEffecttankshooting     particleSystem.EmitParticlestank.TurretMuzzlePosition  codepre  pThe problem is that this would require an own stack for every active unit, and that means an own thread for every active unit. Aditionally, as stated above, I fear some OS overhead from the thread switching. This leads me to my first questionp  h2Is there a class in the .NET framework that allows me to have a seperate stack without having the overhead of a threadh2  psupsubStack obviously referring to the call stack, and not to the data structure.subsupp  pAFAIK the strongThreadPoolstrong and strongTaskstrong classes which internally either uses a new thread or the ThreadPool are not suited for longrunning tasksthreads as they provide a limited number of threads and therefore a limited number of stacks. According to MSDN, a task marked as longrunning just creates a thread in the background.p  pOf course I benchmarked the performance implications of running a lot of threads that are not in the readyqueue. It turns out that they are quite acceptable the creation of 10k threads takes a bit under a second, and as I can reuse threads for new units once an old one dies, this performance overhead comes only at loading time. The frame time overhead of 10k threads seems to be about 12 ms per frame although I tested with a very high framerate, Im not sure how this scales, which isnt that great, but probably acceptable, considering 10k units will require a lot of performance anyway and therefore be more like the upper bound of units existing simultaneously.p  pAnd before you ask yes, memory consumption was a few hundred megabytes, but thats relatively low compared to the memory the rest of the game requires. Its not designed for lowend computers anyway  p  pSo my result is basically Performance overhead is not great, but acceptable even with threads. But The performance was terrible like, literally a hundred times worse when I ran the benchmark with Visual Studio debugging, because the VS 15 UI displays all the threads and a lot of threadrelated events. I like this behaviour in general, because it makes debugging multithreaded applications much easier, but when displaying emtheseem threads, performance is kill. So my second question which would be answered by the first one, too isp  h2Is there a possibillity to hide a thread from Visual Studioh2  pYou might now argue that threads are not made for mass production and constant blocking, and that this approach is an abuse of threads. That might be true, but there are several reasons against thisp  ol liMy task manager shows me more than 1.5k threads running right now, while just having a browser and Visual Studio open. This doesnt seem to cause any performance issues, and I bet that most of these threads are not in the ReadyQueue but are currently blocking. I cant look it up in the Windows task manager, but when using htop on Linux its visible that most threads are not actually doing anything. Not only my benchmarks, but the system I use everyday shows me that having a lot of idle threads in the background is no problem at all.li liMSowned Windows Forms works in a kind of similar way when a dialog box is opened, the current thread stops, but certain OS threads keep the window semiresponsive make noise when clicked. This requires a vastly smaller amount of threads though.li liEven if threads are not really designed for this use case, they might still work just fine. If you say dont use threads, they arent made for this, I would prefer a reason that refers to the properties of the concept or implementation of the thread, and not to the incentive of the author of threads  because an incentive alone doesnt neccesarily break anything li ol  pI guess that I am not the only person on earth encountering this kind of situation.

Negative 1090 pWhat is the most efficient algorithm for grouping identical items together in an array, given the followingp  ol liAlmost all items are duplicated several times.li liThe items are not necessarily integers or anything else thats similarly simple.  The range of the keys is not even welldefined, let alone small.  In fact, the keys can be arbitrary structs.  This rules out the most simple forms of counting sort.li liWe care about both asymptotic and nonasymptotic properties, and n may be small sometimes.  However, when n is small, performance is still important because this function may be called several million times in a loop on millions of small datasets.  This rules out any expensive hash function or using a complex data structure that needs to perform lots of memory allocations.li liThe data may be sorted in arbitrary order as long as all identical items are grouped together.li ol  pIf this is confusing, heres an example, assuming such a function is named groupIdenticalp  precodeuint[] foo  [1,2,3,2,1,5,4,5] uint[] bar  groupIdenticalfoo  One possibile correct value for bar  bar  [2,2,1,1,3,4,5,5].

Negative 1090 pThis is a WinForm MDI application problem .net framework 3.0. It will be described in C. Sorry it is a bit long because I try to make things as clear as possible.p  pI have a MDI application. At some point I find that one MDI child form is never released. There is a menu that creates the MDI child form and show it. When the MDI child form is closed, it is supposed to be destroyed and the memory taken by it should be given back to .net. But to my surprise, this is not true. All the MDI child form instances are kept in memory. This is obviously a memory leak. Well, it is not a real leak in .net. It is just that I think the closed form should be dead but somehow there is at least one unknown reference from outside world that still connect with the closed form.p  pI read some articles on the Web. Some says that when the MDI child form is closing, I should unwire all the event handlers, otherwise some event handlers may keep my form alive. Some says that DataBindings should be cleaned before the form is closing otherwise the DataBindings will add references to some global Hashtable and thus keep my form alive.p  pMy form contains quite a lot things. Many event handlers and many DataBindings and many BindingSources and few suspected controls containing user control and HelpProvider. I create a big method that unwires all the event handlers from all the relevant controls, clear all the DataBindings and DataSources. The HelpProvider and user controls are disposed carefully.p  pAt the end, I find that, I dont have to clear DataBindings and DataSources. Event handlers are definitely causing the problem. And MDI form structure also contributes to something.p  pDuring my experiments, I find that, if you create a MDI child form, even if you close it, there will still be one instance in the memory. The reference is from PropertyStore of the main form. This means, unless the main form is closed application ends, there will always be one instance of MDI child form in the memory. The good news is that, no matter how many times you open and close the child form, there will be only one instance, not a big leak.p  pWhen it comes to event handlers, things become more tricky. I have to address that, all the event handlers on my form are anonymous event handlers. Here is an example codep  pOn MDI child forms design code...p  pButton btnSave  new Button p  pbtnSave.Click  new System.EventHandlerbtnSaveClickp  pWhere btnSaveClick is also a method in MDI child form. The above is always the case for various controls and various types of event. To me, this is a bidirectional circular reference. btnSave keeps a reference of MDI child form via the event handler. MDI child form keeps a reference of btnSave instance. To me again, such bidirectional circular reference should not cause any problem for .nets garbage collector. This means that I do not have to explicitly unwire the event when the form is being disposedp  pbtnSave.Click  btnSaveClickp  pBut the truth is not so. For some event handlers, they are safe. Ignoring them do not cause any duplicate instance. For some other event handlers, they will cause one instance remaining in the memory similar effect as the MDI form structure, but this time caused by the hanging event handlers. For some other event handlers, they will cause every instance opened in the memory. I am totally confused about the differences between these three types of event handlers. The controls are created in the same way and the event is attached in the same way. What is the difference Dont tell me it is the event handle methods that make difference. Anyone has experience of this wired scenario and has an answer for me Thanks a lot.p  pSo now, for safety issue, I will have to unwire all the event handlers when the form is being disposed. That will be a long list of similar code for each control. Is there a general way of removing events from controls in recursive way using reflection What about performance issuep  pThats the end of my story and I am still in the middle of my problem. For any help, I thank you.p

I am wondering if there is a better way...p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  ul liI wish to stress, that this is just a draft implementation, it works for simple cases and it is broken for more complex ones, like when there are method overloads or method renames I do not know VB, so I did not even think it was possible. But it emphasizes my point that it demands much work to do it right.li liWhy would I want such a thing We need to create types dynamically using Reflection.Emit based on certain dynamically acquired metadata. The generated dynamic type implements certain interface, say IDynamicObject, and may derive from some ancestor type. That ancestor type is statically compiled. Until recently, the ancestor type was not allowed to implement the IDynamicObject interface. Given an instance of the dynamic type, one had to explicitly cast it to IDynamicObject in order to gain access to its methods remember, that the generated dynamic type does implement the interface. I would like to eliminate these explicit casts. The only way to do so is by letting the ancestor type implement the IDynamicObject interface. However, the implementation must be all abstract, which is verified by the dynamic type creation code. Voila.li ul

Negative 1090 pRecently Im trying to reuse some UI elements in my application. When I started programming with WPF Im told that DataTemplate is the best way to reuse UI elements. You can define a template for your data entity and use it everywhere. It sounds very good.  However, I also found some disadvantages, especially when it is compared with UserControl. p  ol liYou cannot reuse a DataTemplate defined in another Window or UserControl. For example, if UserDataTemplate is define in WindowA.xaml, you cannot use it in WindowB.xaml. The solution might be that put the DataTemplate as a resource in a global Resource Dictionary.li liDataTemplate is hard to have some code behind. As mentioned in item 1, if you put the DataTemplate in a ResourceDictionary, there is no place to put your code by default. I googled the problem and yes, I found a trick to make the  ResourceDictionary have a cs file. But it still has another problem.li lipAnother problem of DataTemplate is that you must be clear with the difference between the instance of DataTemplate itself and the instances of the content of DataTemplate. A DataTemplate will have only one instance of DataTemplate, and may have many instances of the content of the DataTemplate. Let me explain it with an Examplep  precodeltDataTemplategt         ltDataTemplate.Resourcesgt                 ltmyUser xkeyUser1gt         ltDataTemplate.Resourcesgt                         ltGrid MouseLeftButtonDownOnMouseLeftButtonDowngt                 ltGrid.Resourcesgt                         ltmyUser xkeyUser2gt                 ltGrid.Resourcesgt         ltGridgt         ltDataTemplategt   public partial class CodeBehind           Point mousePos  new Point   precode    private void OnMouseLeftButtonDownobject sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e                    mousePos  e.Pos...      codepre   codepreli ol  pThe result will be that  User1 will only have one instance, however, a User2 instance will be created once the DataTemplate is applied, which means User2 will have many instances if the datatemplate is being applied many times. However, unlike UserControl, the field mousePos will NOT have many copies. If the DataTemplate is being applied 100 times, the mousePos wont have 100 copies, which mean the 100 Grids will use the only one mousePos field as the same time, which may cause problems. In UserControl, the field you defined will only be used by the control. 100 UserControl instances will have 100 field copies.p  pMaybe Im using DataTemplate in the wrong way. Any comment is appreciated.p  pBest regards,p  pZachp

Negative 1090 pI need some advice. I have to create a subscription notification service for my system.

What they do looks rather sophisticated, so not probable to happen by a bug  they both ignore all folders that are in .hgsub. Had the opposite happened all subrepos treated as regular folders of the main repo rather than being treated as unversioned, I would have thought its a bug caused by not treating subrepos. But clearly both apps acknowledge the .hgsub filep  pAm I doing something wrong, or is it a bugp

Negative 1090 pHi therebrbr I work in a movie production company, not as a programmer but as video compositor, but because I have some experience programming Ive been picked by the boss to reprogram the company website.br My experience is with small htmlcssphp websites, flash and basic PHP CMSs, so Im a bit overwhelmed with all the choice available these days. Searching around this forum clears things up but also introduces confusion. I have trouble seeing the difference between a framework and a CMS, or undestanding MVC  brbr The website is flash based at the moment, which is not desired anymore because of iPad compatibility, but they still want it to look cool like a flash website a checklist of things they want it to bebr  multilingual br  iPad and iPhone compatiblebr  3 or 4 different users will update content, mostly video clips.

I know Python, so Django seems like a natural solution, but which steps should I take in that caseshould I use the Django CMS or whatAnd what about RoRIt seems very exciting from the outset, but Im slightly afraid I might get too lost learning the language and never find out how to actually build something with it, is that a legitimate concernbrbr I dont mind taking a somewhat adventurous route with this  I have no pressure to finish this project, its something im supposed to do in my spare time at work  and I want to learn something thats useful in the future.

Negative 1090 pI almost finished writing the first draft of my games logic engine which is entity  component based. Its not perfectly based on that philosophy, but I also think that how the implementation is done differs from person to person. Im writing in C using OOP, STL and virtual functions. Yes, I know that virtual functions may be slow but its not an exercise for doing something very fast, just a logic engine which can be easily extended and easily understood by others everything is also commented. Its just an exercise of software design by a newbie to game developing if you may wish to call it that way.p  pMy first draft is almost complete, the core services various inits, directX, etc are separated from the game logic and are ready to be used. Im just trying to finish the logic engine before I can make my first prototype game I think about an isometric ARPG. The GL engine is built like a tree of classes, starting at the top with the basic abstract class Entity and deriving from it more and more specific classes. There are no more than 3 or 4 levels of inheritance anywhere for good design reasons.. I think.p  pBut I may have a serious problem in certain classes in which I declare as member variables objects of another class, this happens after the IDE kicks in and analyzes what Ive written, it underlines those specific member variables type the class name and it says it isnt declared anywhere. Then after a split of a second, the red underline disappears and it says its ok and declared o.O IT HAPPENS AGAIN AND AGAIN everytime it analyses the code. This happens also in another class with another type of class. Just to be clear, I did include all the relevant headers and it SHOULD know about the types declaration and where is it done.p  pAlso, if I try to compile, it gives me codeglnonrenderableentity.h21 error C2143 syntax error  missing  before code and codeglnonrenderableentity.h21 error C4430 missing type specifier  int assumed. Note C does not support defaultintcode in pairs for each offending variable.p  pI know that the cause of this is not finding its type anywhere which strangely, the IDE finds, almost a second after each analysis. Sometimes those errors would be duplicated in the compilers output and after tweaking a little how the headers where included, I get only one copy per variable and it still doesnt makes sense, Im using include guards.. doesnt VS 2010 Express understand pragmas p  pI think it may be a header problem, but the most intriguing thing for me is why the hell the IDE underlines the variables type with red, saying it cant find it and after a second or two it finds it, no more problem, but when I compile all the project it gives me the former mentioned errors above.p  pEvery time I had a problem, I researched and found a fix on my own, even problems with the IDE the famous msbuild bug. But I just cant figure this out and I need the help of the veterans. Anyone has a clue of why the IDE is reacting like that  The disappearing red underline after each analysis of the IDE must mean something. I know this happens with new variables when you write until the IDE finds their declarations, but its only once and then its ok no matter what.. with those 2 specific classes, it always does again and again this and those are the only ones having this problem. Other member variables from other classes dont have this problem.p  pThank you. Sorry for the long post, but Ive tried making myself clear as hard as I could. If anyone wants any more information, please..p  pemSOLVEDemp  pIt was a circular reference problem, just use a forward declaration and youre fine.p

If I do a direct JOIN, values A and C wont line up with each other, leaving me only with the pairs of B.p  pstrongI thought of one more problem with this, thoughstrong In trying to use a subquery, the subquery would be constantly rerun... meaning that previously selected rows would then be up for grabs again the next time, leading to incorrect values.p  pFor instance, with A,B and B,C...

Negative 1090 pIm writing a small tcp echo server for testing buffer overruns on Linux. I have two slightly different versions of the server code. When an over sized buffer is sent the the first it overflows as expected in the read function causing a Segmentation Fault. For the second version of the code I added a While 1 loop around the accept, read, and write functions so that the server will not exit under normal use, however when the same buffer is sent to the second server there is no overflow and the server does not crash at all. Im having trouble figuring out why, the code is identical short of the while loop. Any help would be very appreciated. p  pSERVER 1p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltsyssocket.hgt include ltnetinetin.hgt  int mainint argc, char argv[]      int sockfd, newsockfd, portno, clilen     char recv[512]     bzerorecv,512     struct sockaddrin servaddr, cliaddr     if argc lt 2 exit1     sockfd  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0     if sockfd lt 0 exit1     bzerochar  ampservaddr, sizeofservaddr     portno  atoiargv[1]     servaddr.sinfamily  AFINET     servaddr.sinaddr.saddr  INADDRANY     servaddr.sinport  htonsportno     if bindsockfd, struct sockaddr  ampservaddr, sizeofservaddr lt 0 exit1     listensockfd,5     clilen  sizeofcliaddr     newsockfd  acceptsockfd, struct sockaddr  ampcliaddr, ampclilen     if newsockfd lt 0 exit1     int n  readnewsockfd,recv,1024     if n lt 0 exit1     writenewsockfd,recv,n     closenewsockfd     return 0  codepre  pSERVER 2p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltsyssocket.hgt include ltnetinetin.hgt  int mainint argc, char argv[]      int sockfd, newsockfd, portno, clilen     char recv[512]     bzerorecv,512     struct sockaddrin servaddr, cliaddr     if argc lt 2 exit1     sockfd  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0     if sockfd lt 0 exit1     bzerochar  ampservaddr, sizeofservaddr     portno  atoiargv[1]     servaddr.sinfamily  AFINET     servaddr.sinaddr.saddr  INADDRANY     servaddr.sinport  htonsportno     if bindsockfd, struct sockaddr  ampservaddr, sizeofservaddr lt 0 exit1     listensockfd,5     clilen  sizeofcliaddr     while 1          newsockfd  acceptsockfd, struct sockaddr  ampcliaddr, ampclilen         if newsockfd lt 0 continue         int n  readnewsockfd,recv,1024         if n lt 0 continue         writenewsockfd,recv,n         closenewsockfd          return 0  codepre

Negative 1090 pIve just started learning Sockets through various Google searches but Im having some problems figuring it out how to properly use Sockets in C and Im in the need of some help.p  pI have a test application Windows Forms and on a different class which is actually in its own .dll, but thats irrelevant I have all the serverclient code for my sockets code.p  pstrongQuestion 1strongp  pOn my test application, on the server part, the user can click the start listening button and the server part of my sockets application should start listening for connections on the specified address and port, so far so good.p  pHowever, the application will be blocked and I cant do anything until someone connects to the server. What if no one connects How should I handle that I could specify a receive timeout but what then It throws an exception, what can I do with that What I would like is to have some sort of activity on the main application so the user knows the application didnt froze and is waiting for connections. But if a connection doesnt come, it should timeout and close everything.p  pMaybe I should use asynchronous calls to sendreceive methods but they seem confusing and I was not able to make it work, only synchronous work Ill post my current code below.p  pstrongQuestion 2strongp  pDo I need to close anything when some sendreceive call times out. As youll see on my current code, I have a bunch of closes on the socket, but this doesnt feel right somehow. But it also doesnt feel right when an operation times out and I dont close the socket.p  pIn conclusion of my two questions.... I would like an application that doesnt block so the user knows the server is waiting for a connection with a little marquee animation for instance. If a connection is never established after a period of time, I want to close everything that should be closed. When a connection is established or if it doesnt happen after a period of time, I would like to inform the main application of the result.p  pHeres some of my code, the rest is similar. The codePacketcode class is a custom class that represents my custom data unit, its just a bunch of properties based on codeenumscode for now, with methods to convert them to bytes and back into properties.p  pThe function that starts to listen for connections is something like thisp  precodepublic void StartListeningstring address, int port      try          byte[] bufferBytes  new byte[32]          ifaddress.Equals0.0.0.0              udpSocket.Bindnew IPEndPointIPAddress.Any, port          else              udpSocket.Bindnew IPEndPointIPAddress.Parseaddress, port                   remoteEndPoint  new IPEndPointIPAddress.Any, 0          int numBytesReceived  udpSocket.ReceiveFrombufferBytes, ref remoteEndPoint          ifnumBytesReceived  0              udpSocket.Close             return                   Packet syncPacket  new PacketbufferBytes          ifsyncPacket.PacketType  PacketType.Control              udpSocket.Close             return               catch          ifudpSocket  null              udpSocket.Close                codepre  pIm sure that I have a bunch of unnecessary code but Im new at this and Im not sure what do, any help fixing up my code and how to solve the issues above is really appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI should probably have stated that my requirements are to use UDP and implement these things myself in the application layer. You can consider this as homework but I havent tagged as such because the code is irrelevant and will not be part of my grade and my problem my question is in how to code as my Sockets experience is minimal and its not taught.p  pHowever I must say that I solved my problem for now I think... I was using threading on the demo application which was giving me some problems, now Im using it in the protocol connections, makes more sense and I can easily change my custom protocol class properties and read those from the demo application.p  pI have specified a timeout and throw a SocketException if it reaches the timeout. Whenever an exception like this is caught, the socket connection is closed. Im just talking about the connection handshake, nothing more. If no exceptions are caught, the code probably went smooth and the connection is established.p  pPlease adapt your answers accordingly. Right now it doesnt make sense for me to marky any of them as the accepted answer, hope you understand.p

Negative 1090 pThis pertains to a project I am inheriting and cannot change table structure or data access model.  I have been asked to optimize the algorithm being used to insert data into the database.p  pWe have a dataset in table T.  From that, we pull a set we will call A.  We also query an XML feed and get a set we will call X.p  ul liIf a value from X is in A, record in A must be updated to reflect data for X.recordli liIf a value from X is not in A, X.record must be inserted into Ali liIf a value from A is not in X, A.record must be preserved in Ali liX must be fully iterated through for all records, and A must be updatedli ul  pAll these changes need to be insert back into the database.p  pThe algo as set up does the followingp  precodeQuery XML into a LIST foreach over the XML LIST     look up foreach.item in A via LINQ i.e. query  from record in A where                                                          record.GUID  foreach.item.GUID                                                          select record     if query.Count  0         insert into A via context.AddToTableNamenewTableNameObject     else         var currentRecord  query.First         set all properties on currentRecord  properties from foreach.item         context.SaveChanges codepre  pI know this to be suboptimal.  I tried to get A into a object call it queryA outside of the foreach loop in an effort to move the query to memory and not hitting the disk, but after thinking that through, I realized the database was already in memory.p  pHaving added timer objects into the algo, its clear that what is costing the most time is the SaveChanges function call.  In some cases its 20ms, and in some others, in explicably, it will jump to 100ms.p  pI would prefer to only call the SaveChanges one time.  I cant figure out how to do that given my depth of knowledge of EF which is thin at best and the constraints of not being able to change the table structures and having to preserve data from A which is not in X.p  pSuggestionsp

Negative 1090 pI have somewhat of a problem. My old webserver windows 2003 have been replaced, with a 2008 R2.

Negative 1090 pI was having a conversation about strings and various languages a while back, and the topic of a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStringinterningstring interninga came up.  Apparently Java and the .NET framework do this automatically with all strings, as well as several scripting languages.  Theoretically, it saves memory because you dont end up with multiple copies of the same string, and it saves time because string equality comparisons are a simple pointer comparison instead of an ON run through each character of the string.p  pBut the more I think about it, the more skeptical I grow of the concepts benefits.  It seems to me that the advantages are mostly theoreticalp  ul liFirst off, to use automatic string interning, all strings must be immutable, which makes a lot of string processing tasks harder than they need to be. And yes, Ive heard all the arguments for immutability in general. Thats not the point.li liEvery time a new string is created, it has to be checked against the string interning table, which is at least a ON operation. strongEDITstrong Where N is the size of the string, not the size of the table, since this was confusing people.  So unless the ratio of string equality comparisons to new string creation is pretty high, its unlikely that the net time saved is a positive value.li liIf the string equality table uses strong references, the strings will never get garbage collected when theyre no longer needed, thus wasting memory.  On the other hand, if the table uses weak references, then the string class requires some sort of finalizer to remove the string from the table, thus slowing down the GC process.  Which could be pretty significant, depending on how the string intern table is implemented. Worst case, deleting an item from a hash table can require an ON rebuild of the entire table under certain circumstances.li ul  pThis is just the result of me thinking about implementation details.  Is there something Ive missed Does string interning actually provide any significant benefits in the general casep  pstrongEDIT 2strong All right, apparently I was operating from a mistaken premise.  The person I was talking to never pointed out that string interning was optional for newlycreated strings, and in fact gave the strong impression that the opposite was true.  Thanks to Jon for setting the matter straight. Another accepted answer for him.p

Negative 1090 pIm having all sorts of size problems with Qt. I am creating my own widgets and using different layouts generally, I need my own to make them work properly without spending hours on the powerful default layouts... which dont lay things out as intended.p  pOnce Im done with a widget and its layout though, it doesnt work right. The size is never getting set properly unless I call widgetresize1, 1 which finally forces a resize and makes the widget look correct i.e. recompute the geometry. Even the updateGeometry call has no effect.p  pThis is a dreadful problem when the resize needs to be called on the parent widget uck and from what Im reading should not be necessary were the layouts properly programmed.p  pIs there a sample that works and is not several thousand of lines long, or does Qt require several thousand of lines to make anything work perfectly, even the simplest widgetp  pWhat are the minimal functions to be called to make a widget amp its layout work at oncep  pThank you. Alexisp  pP.S. I tried to implement the sizeHint, minimumSize, maximumSize, others that Im missing I was hoping that would be enough. Obviously, I also implement the setGeometry on the layout to resize the children appropriately.p  p addition 1p  pThere is a sample image with a layout that clearly isnt available as is in Qt. The positioning, functions, and colors of the different keys is XML driven and works for any keyboard in the world.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjPhm7.png altOn screen keyboardp  pnote, this sample doesnt show the Enter key displayed on two rows and wider below than at the top more or less, not doable at all with the regular layouts of course, it works with my version.p  p clarificationp  pIm not too sure how to describe the problem better. I was thinking to write a test widget next to see how I can reproduce the problem and then post that and eventually fix it. 8p  pThe default layout function that the internal Qt layouts make use of require a lot of coding. I would like to avoid having to copypaste all of that because for maintenance, it makes it close to impossible.p  p todays findingsp  pAs I needed to tweak one of the widgets, I decided to add a VBoxLayout and make it work.p  pI actually found the problem... One of the widgets in my tree is a QScrollArea and that sizeHint returns 1, 1. Not exactly what Id expect but... whatever you put inside that widget has better know how to compute its width and height or else... it fails.p  pLooking at the code closely, I could actually compute the width by using the widest width found. Once I used that, the widget would appear and it actually resizes itself as things change in the list, kinda cool.p  pThis being said, my earlier comment about having a tree of widgets that autoresize themselves stands. From the root up to the parents of the leaves in your tree, all of those widgets will need a valid layout. Once I added one in the top widget it resized itself and its children properly well... in my case up to the QScrollArea, the rest required a bottom to top resizing. Funny how that worksp  p ah ha moment or what you find reading the implementation codep  pToday I bumped in another problem which just needed the correct call... I just couldnt find anything worth it in the documentation.p  pAll the objects have a layout now, but a certain parent would not resize properly. Plain simple.p  pI had a call to the parent as followingp  precode changes to the children are changing the geometry parentWidgetgtupdateGeometry codepre  pYeah. The docs says thats what you have to do. Nothing happens at all with that call. No idea what its supposed to do, I did not look at that function. It never did anything for me anyway.p  pSo... I looked at the layout to try to understand how it would send the info updown. I did not see much except for one interesting commentp  precode will trigger resize codepre  pThis is said of the SetFixedSize mode. To reach that function you need to make the layout for update. Ah Yes... the layout, not the parent widget... lets try that insteadp  precodeparentWidgetgtlayoutgtupdate codepre  pAnd voila It resizes correct in all cases I have. Quite incredible that the widget updateGeometry doesnt trigger the same effect...p

Negative 1090 pWere using a small app Flash to allow visitors to identify their content preferences. The end result of the app is a list of Items, which we present to the user as Content you might be interested in think of it as similar to Amazons Page That You Built.

Negative 1090 pI have the following problem. In my application, every user could execute actions through a web client, as well as through email. Every action a method in a controller class has to implicitly store a notification in an external keyvalue store I am using Redis In addition, if the action was executed via email, the executor has to be notified about the state of the action successfailure via email as well. The main problem that I experience is how to engineer the whole structure with maximum separation of concerns. For instance, I do not want the controller methods themselves to do anything about storing the notificationsending a response email. p  pInitially I wanted to use AOP, and simply decorate my methods with ActionactionType, unfortunately I would also need to know who the sender is. As far as I know, I cannot assign values to annotation attributes at runtime, so I had to think of another way. p  pThe second approach would be to use an Around intereceptor, to stop the execution of a method, grab the current user from a sessionscoped userService, but again, that would work for the web controller only, because the mail processing class is stateless, and is unaware of a concept such as currentUser the only way I can grab the sender is through the email paramater that it is supplied with, every time when a new mail comesp  pI guess, the simplest approach would be to call a notification service explicitly, from every method that needs notification in both, the web request controller, and the mail processor, but again, that would lead to the methods knowing a little bit too much.p  pAny suggestionsp

The temporary files just keep building up and filling the servers disk.p  pWhat I wanted to do here would be to delete the temporary files that are generated from the zip after each zip file is processed I have to maintain the zip file itself, so my objective is not to delete those.p  pThe code snippet that handles the messages is the followingp  precode    ZipFile zipFile  new ZipFilefile      try          Enumerationlt extends ZipEntrygt entries  zipFile.entries         whileentries.hasMoreElements             ZipEntry zipEntry  entries.nextElement              InputStream in  zipFile.getInputStreamzipEntry              try                  do stuff with the inputstream                  in.close                 in  null                          finally                  ifin  null                     in.close                                  zipEntry  null                            finally          zipFile.close      codepre  pIs there any way in Java to access and delete these temporary files Am I doing something wrong herep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1090 pI came up with a small problem. Now, Ive got a program which plots  graphs. For that Ive set up few functions.  First when loaded the graph gets initialized with the plotspace  etc. Then when the user clicks a button, a new plot gets added to the  graph. But with that I have the necessity to change the  codeplotSpace.xRangecode and codeplotsPace.yRangecode. How can I do so after having  initialized the graph already  Thanks for your thoughtsp

Negative 1090 pAs you know, OnIdle can be specified in MFC UI thread. For details, you can read this reference a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary1sa2f19f.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary1sa2f19f.aspxa. But I am not sure how it can be used in practice. p  pAccording to the reference above,p  pOnIdle is called in the default message loop when the threads message queue is empty. Use your override to call your own background idlehandler tasks.p  pSo I can understand that when the UI thread is not busy, the method is called.  According to the documentation above,p  pBecause the application cannot process messages until OnIdle returns, do not perform lengthy tasks in this function.p  pBut what tasks can be done in the idle event A single example would suffice. Thanksp  pUPDATE One discouraging fact is that a hrefhttpwww.microsoft.commsjarchives39cd.aspx relnofollowthis old 1996 articlea is very helpful to understand CWinThread.p

Negative 1090 pI am developing a framework for reproducible computing with R. One problem that I am struggling with is that some R code might run perfectly in version X.YZ of a package, but then why you try to reproduce it 3 years later, the packages have updated, some functions are changed, and the code doesnt run anymore. This problem affects also for example Sweave documents that use packages.p  pThe only way to confidently reproduce the results is by installing the R version and version of the packages that were used by the original author. If this was a single case, one could pull stuff from the CRAN archives and install appropriate versions. But for my framework this is impractical, and I need to have the package versions preinstalled.p  pAssume for now that I restrict myself to a single version of R, e.g. 2.14. What would be a practical way to install many versions of R packages, so that I can load them on the fly I suppose I can do something like creating separate library directories for every version of every package and then using custom lib.loc arguments while loading them. This is going to be messy though. Any tips or previous attempts to do something similarp  pMy framework runs on Ubuntu server.p

Negative 1090 pI am working on an MFC application that runs on Windows XP SP3.  One of the requirements is that when a user logs into the application, the application must mount several SMB shares hosted on an embedded Linux server using that users credentials.p  pThe program has a switch user feature, which allows a different user to log in without closing the application, terminating the first users session.  When that happens, the SMB shares must be unmounted and then remounted as the new user.p  pWe do this by calling a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa38542728vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowcodeWNetCancelConnection2codea followed immediately by a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa38541328vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowcodeWNetAddConnection2codea.  codeWNetCancelConnection2code returns codeNOERRORcode, indicating it was successful.  strongHowever, sometimes codeWNetAddConnection2code will fail to remount the drive as the new user.strong  Using codeFormatMessagecode to obtain an error string from the return value results in this error message, despite the fact that codeWNetCancelConnection2code seemed to succeedp  blockquote   blockquote     pMultiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user, using more than one user name, are not allowed. Disconnect all previous connections to the server or shared resource and try again.p   blockquote blockquote  pRunning codenet usecode from the command prompt does not show an open connection to the SMB share either.p  pstrongThis failure will not occur if the user never interacts with the mounted drive.  It only occurs if the user has accessed the mounted drive in some way, i.e. the user opened the mounted drive in Windows Explorer.strong  Likewise, it does not occur if you quit the application completely and then restart it and log in as a different user.p  pAll of this leads me to believe that there is a race condition where codeWNetCancelConnection2code returns before all open handles to the network resource are closed.  My question is strongcan I make my program block or wait after calling codeWNetCancelConnection2code until all those handles are closed, guaranteeing that codeWNetAddConnection2code doesnt fail in this waystrong  Either a blocking API or a way to busywait for the connection to be fully closed would be acceptable.  Either would be preferable to codesleepcode and hope for the best. p

Negative 1090 pI unwittingly ran a Java program on Linux where the partition that it, its properties and logs resided on was close to 100 full. It failed, but after clearing up the problem with the disk space, I ran it again and it failed a second time because its properties file was 0 bytes long.p  pI dont have source of the file and I dont want to go as far as decompiling the class files, but I was wondering whether the corruption of the properites could be because the program failed to write to the properties file.p  pThe mystery is that, I expected that the properties would be readonly and dont recall any items being updated by the program. Could it be that even if the properties are only read, the file is opened in readwrite mode and could disappear if the partition is fullp  pN.b. this program has run without failure or incident at least 1000 times over several years.p

What I was looking to do is to mask some areas of the image and add links to them, and so I used the following code to mask some icons so I could attach links to them and make them clickable things like facebook, twitter links, etc..

Negative 1090 pI have a java swing application that is running scripts using javax.script. The scripts access the swing widgets and simulate user actions, like codeJButton.doClickcode. Some of the widget actions cause one or more codeThreads SwingWorkercode to start, and I need the script to wait until all the codeThreadscode have completed. But the scripts run in the Event Dispatch Thread, so if I do, for example, a codeCountDownLatchcode with an codeawaitcode inside a codeFutureTaskcode, then codesubmitcode and codegetcode, the codegetcode will stop the EDT, and the GUI hangs. No way to have the script wait without stopping the EDT. Any workarounds for this problemp  pThanksp

When objects are touching or practically in, or on the sensor it applies force toward its own midpoint. When objects hit the midpoint I want them to do something, but Im not sure how to check whether a given body is touchinginside the bounds of the sensor AND touching its midpoint.p  pIn the really well drawn diagram below the blue circle is the sensor, the green circle is a body, and the little blue dot is the midpoint. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwNS5O.jpg altenter image description herep  pUPDATE In the end I put a sensor in the middle and checked for that  it was the simplest way. p

Negative 1090 pI was about to use CDN for one of high traffic site to serve all static contents from CDN instead of primary server.p  pWhile I have looked at many CDN Provider, including Amazon Cloud Front, CacheFly, EdgeCast, GoGrid and others, I still didnt exactly understand how they fetch original file from original server.p  pThere is no information of that on Amazon CloudFronts document. They provide API but still its poor in clear documentation. For CacheFly amp EdgeCast I didnt find any detail, and GoGrid support technicians doesnt know how that works, and noted my contact details to send me more details.p  pHere is what I understood is that... I need to first customize my application asp.net website to have its static content url to be changed to, CDN to load files from CDN. Then it will fetch contents from CDN instead of original servers. p  pBut still not clear how CDN will cache or stores static contents like images,js,html,txt,css files from original server. Trying to google, some suggests to use some tools similar to FTP to upload static contents to Amazon CloudFront.. but the site Im working on is a large dynamic site, with lot of static content... and uploading it that way is not an option.p  pMoreover, how does CDN handles contents that have changed  p  pDo we need to use some API to program files upload to CDN or any CDN does it automatically making our life easier  What are best practicesp  pPlease advice. p

Negative 1090 pFor some reason using dispatchasync and Core Data together causes my app to completely freeze, but not crashed. p  h2Symptomh2  pThe user interface is not responsive. The app does not crash. p  pThe app uses code[[UIAccelermeter sharedAccelerometer] setDelegate self]code to get accelerometer values continuously. The codeaccelerometerdidAcceleratecode callback runs on main thread. When this issue occurs, the callback no longer executes.p  pTherefore the main thread appears to be frozen.p  h2Contexth2  pI use codeNSURLConnectioncode in my app to send HTTP requests to my server. In connectionDidFinishLoading, where response data is handled, it takes about 2 seconds to execute and the user interface would be unresponsive during those 2 seconds, because it runs in the main thread.p  pAfter some research, it seems that codegcddispatchasynccode is the best solution for this situation to execute the data handling in the background. So, in codeconnectionDidFinishLoadingcode, I added the following gcd callsp  precodedispatchqueuet queue queue  dispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYDEFAULT, 0 dispatchasyncqueue,      [self handleTheData connection]  codepre  pThis works fine sometimes, but it would cause app to freeze randomly  Even though same code is used, with the same data in Core Data storage, repeated tests show that symptom can be observed X of the time. The chance of issue happening is affected by a few factors, explained further below.p  h2What does handleTheData doh2  pIt examines the response data from codeNSURLConnectioncode, which is JSON formatted string. The string is 3 lists of entity, and each entity is an array of array of numbers. So there are codes to convert the JSON formatted string into 3 NSMutableArray of custom object, where each object is a subclassed NSManagedObject.p  pDuring the convertion, since these ojects are temporary in that they may or may not get stored permanently, they are created in nil NSManagedObjectContext, like sop  precodeSampleEntity newEntity  SampleEntity  [[NSManagedObject alloc] initWithEntityentity                         insertIntoManagedObjectContextnil                ] codepre  pThis way, they will not be mixed with the main context.p  pThen these new objects are compared with existing entities in data store. So there are some codes to fetch from data store repeatedly to see if a particular new entity already existed, and depending on the data of the new entity, the new entity may be saved to data store, or the existing entity may be updated.p  p[managedObjectContext save amperror] is called often to ensure that changes are saved permanently.p  h2Anything else running in backgroundh2  pAs mentioned in Symptom section, Accelerometer runs in the background in the main thread using [[UIAccelermeter sharedAccelerometer] setDelegate self] p  pAudioUnits have also been set up to run in the background on a separate priority thread according to Apple docs to produce sound.p  h2Findings on cause of issueh2  pIt was found that the chance of issue happening is affected by the following factorsp  ul liIf some debugging code is commented out, such as NSLogfetchedResult , fetchedResult, the chance of issue happening decreases but it still occurs.li liIf accelerometer is not used, the issue almost never occur but not 100 sure as I did a limited number of tests.li liIf accelerometer is used, the chance of issue happening is about 5050.li liIf some of the Core Data codes such as [sampleEntity setXYZ..] is commented out, the issue almost never occurs even though accelerometer is used.li ul  h2Second Issueh2  pAlso, even if the main thread is not frozen, ANOTHER ISSUE occurs.

Negative 1090 pIm one of those socalled developers who got their way with Delphi without really understanding or even thinking about basics. In this case, Im talking about strongstringsstrong.p  pWhile I do understand how strongpreallocating memorystrong can result in a significant speed gain. I dont understand how to use it in simple, realworld, cases this is even more true with the TStringBuilder.p  pFor example, lets say I have this code that recursively search a folder amp add results to a hash listp  precodevar    FilesList  TDictionaryltString, Bytegt   Byte  file  0, folder  1     procedure AddFolderconst AFolderName  String var    FileName  String    AHandle   THandle    FindData  TWin32FindData begin      AHandle  FindFirstFilePCharAFolderName  , FindData      if AHandle  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE then         Exit       repeat            if FindData.dwFileAttributes And FILEATTRIBUTEDIRECTORY  0 then            begin                  Add a file.

Negative 1090 pI am currently writing a web application using angularjs, but I think this question applies to any clientside javascript framework that does routing on the client side a hrefhttpsdocs.angularjs.orgapingRoute relnofollowas angular doesa.p  pIn a singlepage app, what is the right way to deal with wrong URLs p  pLooking at a few major sites, I see that gmail will redirect to the inbox if you type any random URL below a hrefhttpsmail.google.commail relnofollowhttpsmail.google.commaila. This happens serverside with an http 300 code or clientside, depending on whether the wrong path is before or after the  character. On the other hand, twitter shows a real HTTP 404 for any invalid URL. A third option would be to show a soft 404, a purely clientside error page. p  pThese solutions seem appropriate for different situations. Twitter wants the links to twitter users and tweets to be real links, so people can share them, post them in news articles, etc, so it is important that invalid links be recognized as such if I have a broken link to a tweet in my website, a simple crawl will tell me that. In gmail, on the other hand, you are not expected to share links into your inbox, and Im not even sure if the links are really permanentpersistent it seems the url updating mostly serves the purpose of browser history navigation within the singlepage app. The third approach of giving soft errors might be appropriate for situations similar to gmail, but where there is no reasonable default page. p  pAfter this long introduction, here are some specific questionsp  ul liIs it ever acceptable to give a soft error page instead of a 404 error, or should a singlepage app always redirect to a real 404 if a url is invalidli liGmails code may be perfectly bugfree, but if it did have a bug leading to invalid links that end up redirecting back to the inbox, that might be even more confusing for users than an error page. For most web apps out there, that are not as well tested as gmail, would it be better to show an error pageli liTo implement real 404s for singlepage apps, it seems necessary to duplicate the routing logic on the serverside. Is there any way around thisli liWhen redirecting to a 404, I think the user should be able to see the URL that caused the error, possibly in the URL bar. With the html5 history api, I think this can be accomplished by simply triggering a reload of the current page with the wrong url, combined with the serverside routing mentioned above. For browsers that do not support this or when using hashbang notation, this does not seem possible. Whats the best way to support all browsersli ul

After that I can simply mmap this file and get the values with mmap[normalizehashstring, string, string].p  pMy hash function is pretty straightforward but fast and works in my case didnt notice any collisionsp  precodeconcatenatedString  s1.s2.s3 unsigned int hash  31 forint i  0 i lt concatenatedString.length i    hash  hash  101  unsigned int concatenatedString[i]  codepre  pSame with normalization straightforwardp  precodelong n  hash  maxvalue codepre  pstrongnstrong  the upper bound of my normalized range so around 40mln, I take n not n  lowerbound because lowebound  0p  pstrongmaxvaluestrong  maximum value of the old set UINTMAX in my case, minvalue  0 so I do not include it into the equationp  pstrongProblemstrongp  pMy hash function doesnt produce uniformly distributed values dont see how it even could do that in the range of 0 to 4,294,967,295 unsigned int. Because of this after normalization I have quite a few collisions which result in data loss overwriting values under the same array index.p  pAre there any clever ways to do what I want to do but without those collisionsp  pI am fully aware some collision might occur. The thing is with my approach they tend to occur way too often. My hashing range is 100 times bigger than the number of my elements so Im guessing there might be a way to do this but I havent yet figured out how.p  pstrongSolutionstrong In the end I changed my hash to Murmurhash, changed my normalizing method to a simple modulo newRange and changed the format of the file I store all the data now string string string value  the file is pretty big now but thanks to that I was able to implement a simple collision detection mechanism double hashing.p

Negative 1090 pI am completely stuck with this question, so I am looking for any help.p  pI think everybody knows about basic GCD computation algorithms like binary or euclidean GCD. It is not a problem to implement such a method to compute two singleprecision numbers. Actually, its just about couple of strokes.p  pI need to have this method implemented in C language for multipleprecision numbers more than 105 bits. There are couple of GNU libraries available GNU MP, MPFR, MPIR and they have means to define multipleprecision numbers and make an actions on them. It looks like one multipleprecision number stored in memory as couple of singleprecision parts aka limbs.p  pThe have some methods implemented for finding gcda, b, but they, actually, difficult to use for my needs. Binary method for GCD computation used only when a and b contains exactly two limbs. HGCD method used when mina,b contains more than i.e. 630 limbs, etc. I find difficult to figure out, how any of these methods could be expanded for using with any length of a and b. Ive also found that different version of GNU libraries contains different versions and methods of GCD algorithms.p  pstrongQuestionstrong I want to find out is it possible to make the binary GCD algorithm works with multipleprecision integers of any length in terms of limbs, and if it possible  to get any help or ideas how to implement it in C.

Negative 1090 pI very recently wrote a program for a friend where it simplifies some important daily calculations for himher. Now, the problem I am having is that I want to compile the code into an executable program so that heshe can comfortably run it on their machine, perhaps with a simple graphical interface or whatnot.p  pI have tried using cxFreeze with Python 3.3.0 64 bit but to no avail the program simply refuses to start on their machine I even tried generating an executable via 32bit Python, but also to no avail. What I then thought was that I could perhaps generate an executable program via PyGame But the fact of the matter is that I have never used any Pythonrelated program except the IDLE, so I am not sure what to do and look for.p  pAnother option would perhaps be to convert the Python 3.3.0 code to Python 2.x, but the problem is that I am not familiar with Python 2.x and neither is there any automated converter available as far as I know. I was wondering whether anyone of you could direct me to any good sourceslinks, since those I have been ferociously Googling are rather inconcrete. p

Negative 1090 pI have a few TextBlocks in WPF in a Grid that I would like to scale depending on their available width  height. When I searched for automatically scaling Font size the typical suggestion is to put the TextBlock into a ViewBox.p  pSo I did thisp  precodeltGridgt     ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt         ltColumnDefinition Width gt         ltColumnDefinition Width gt         ltColumnDefinition Width gt     ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt      ltViewbox MaxHeight18 Grid.Column0 StretchUniform Margin5 HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretchgt         ltTextBlock TextBinding Text1 gt     ltViewboxgt      ltViewbox MaxHeight18 Grid.Column1 StretchUniform Margin5 HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretchgt         ltTextBlock TextBinding Text2 gt     ltViewboxgt      ltViewbox MaxHeight18 Grid.Column2 StretchUniform Margin5 HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretchgt         ltTextBlock TextBinding Text3 gt     ltViewboxgt ltGridgt codepre  pAnd it scales the font for each TextBlock automatically. However, this looks funny because if one of the TextBlocks has longer text then it will be in a smaller font while its neighboring grid elements will be in a larger font. I want the Font size to scale by group, perhaps it would be nice if I could specify a SharedSizeGroup for a set of controls to auto size their font. p  pe.g.p  pThe first text blocks text might be 3262013 104530 AM, and the second TextBlocks text might say FileName.ext. If these are across the width of a window, and the user begins resizing the window smaller and smaller. The date will start making its font smaller than the file name, depending on the length of the file name.p  pIdeally, once one of the text fields starts to resize the font point size, they would all match. Has anyone came up with a solution for this or can give me a shot at how you would make it work If it requires custom code then hopefully we  I could repackage it into a custom Blend or Attached Behavior so that is reusable for the future.

Somehow I dont feel I am following its output. For instance, shouldnt there have been one thread in state RUNNABLE in the case where there is a monitor instance on which 8 threads are BLOCKED  Some thread has had to gain that monitors lock in order to put other 8 threads in BLOCKED state, is it p  pSecond thing  about TDA terminology  there is the category Threads sleeping on monitors 675 threads sleeping and the one called Thread locking monitors 806 threads locking. Both these categories contain threads which are either WAITING, BLOCKED or TIMEDWAITING.  The only difference I can tell is that the latter category also contains threads in RUNNABLE state. Any other differences between them  What I dont get is the syntagm sleeping on monitors.p  pThanksp

Puzzled I pulled the package down via Composer and noticed that the class loader that Composer generates coderequirecoded these underscored files explicitly, not autoloading as Id expected.p  pFor instance, in the codecrunchregularexpressioncode package there is a namespace called codeCrunchRegularExpressioncodep  precode src  Crunch  RegularExpression       lt folder containing classes  RegularExpression.php  lt file namespace to CrunchRegularExpression                                     containing functions and constants                                      instead of a class codepre  pInitially I thought these underscored files were a feature of PSR0 that I had missed, but then I looked at the Composer generated codeautoloadreal.phpcode and saw that codeRegularExpression.phpcode amongst others was being required explicitlyp  precode loadergtregistertrue  require baseDir . srcCrunchRegularExpression.php require baseDir . srcCrunchRegularExpressionModifier.php require baseDir . srcCrunchRegularExpressionPatternModifier.php require baseDir . srcCrunchRegularExpressionPatternAssertion.php  return loader  codepre  pHavent been able to find any meaningful documentation about this feature of Composer. Is it a good standard for exporting nonclass based namespaced dependencies, like functions and constantsp  h2Updateh2  pMy question turned out to be a slight misnomer. The selected answer lead me to discover that nonclass based assets can be explicitly declared for loading in codecomposer.jsoncodep  precodeautoload      psr0  CrunchRegularExpression src ,     files [         srcCrunchRegularExpression.php,         srcCrunchRegularExpressionModifier.php,         srcCrunchRegularExpressionPatternModifier.php,         srcCrunchRegularExpressionPatternAssertion.php     ]  codepre  pThe underscores on the files were a convention used to delineate them from class definitions and have no special purposes in autoloading.p

Negative 1090 pMy problem need to find all disjoint nonoverlapping sets from a set of sets.p  pBackground I am using comparative phylogenetic methods to study trait evolution in birds. I have a tree with 300 species. This tree can be divided into subclades i.e. subtrees. If two subclades do not share species, they are independent. Im looking for an algorithm and an R implementation if possible that will find all possible subclade partitions where each subclade has greater than 10 taxa and all are independent. Each subclade can be considered a set and when two subclades are independent do not share species these subclades are then disjoint sets. p  pHope this is clear and someone can help.p  pCheers, Glennp  pThe following code produces an example dataset.

Negative 1090 pIm searching for a simple algorithm or an open source library PHP allowing to estimate whether a text mainly uses a specific language. I found the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14765632whatisarelativelysimplewaytodeterminetheprobabilitythatasentenceisfollowing answera relating to Python, which probably leads in the right direction. But something working outofthebox for PHP would be a charm.p  pOf course something like an ngram estimator wouldnt be too hard to implement, but it requires a reference database as well. p  pThe actual problem to solve is as follows. I run a WordPress blog, which currently is flooded by SPAM. The blog is in German language and virtually all trackback spam is English. My idea is to inmmediately spam all trackbacks seeming to be English. However, I cannot use marker words, because I do not want to spam typos or citations.p  pstrongMy solutionstrongp  pUsing the answers to this question I implemented a solution, which detects German by a simple stopword ratio. Any comment must contain at least 25 German stopwords, if it has a link. So you can still comment something like cool article, which has no stopwords at all, but if you put a link, you should bother to write proper language.p  pUnfortunately the stopwords from NLTK are incorrect. The list contains words, which do not exist in German. So I used the a hrefhttpsnowball.tartarus.orgalgorithmsgermanstop.txt relnofollowsnowballa list. Using the a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgdankogaiRegexpOptimizer0.23libRegexpOptimizer.pm relnofollowPerl regexp optimizera I condensed the entire list into a single regexp and count the stopwords using pregmatchall. The whole filter is 25 lines, a third of the Perl code to produce the regexp from the list. Lets see how it performs in the wild.p  pThanks for your help.p
Negative 1090 pI have multiple threads updating a single array in tight loops. 10 threads on a dualcore processor  roughly 100000 updates per second. Each time the array is updated under the protection of a mutex WaitForSingleObject  ReleaseMutex. I have noticed that no thread ever does two consecutive updates to the array which means there must be some sort of yield relating to the synchronization.

I want Jinja to iterate on blocks for each element in the list, and use the block contents to print the keyvalue pairs for each dictionary.p  pI say recursion in the title because my actual implementation uses recursion.  With iteration it is the same concept though, so I use it here for simplicity.p  pSo, my naive attempt at this would be something like this this is more or less pseudocodep  pblock.htmlp  precode extends base.html   block element      ltdo some fancy printing with the current dictionary heregt  endblock  codepre  pbase.htmlp  precode for item in seq      ltligt block element  endblock ltligt  endfor  codepre  p.py file based off GoogleAppEngine Jinja implementationp  precodemyDict   seq [keyA0 valueA0, keyA1 valueA1,                     keyB0 valueB0, keyB1 valueB1]    template  JINJAENVIRONMENT.gettemplateblock.html self.response.writetemplate.rendermyDict codepre  pIm not sure how to structure this to do what I want.  I want instances of the blocks to have the appropriate dictionary from the list to print the values, to output something like thisp  precodeEntry0 keyA0 valueA0 keyA1 valueA1  Entry1 keyB0 valueB0 keyB1 valueB1 codepre  pBut Im not sure how to pass each block the data it needs.  Is this possible with Jinjap
Negative 1090 pI am trying to depict the relationship of different data entities with my ETL extraction transformation loading pipeline. The final output is a large directed graph. So far I am using Python to extract data relationship. Pydot helps me generate svg file which I can open up using a browser. The graph that I generate is static.p  pPydot lets me setup tooltip and allows me to link other html pages with nodes or edges. I am looking for more than that.p  pA small portion of the graph is shown belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7wowc.jpg altDirected Graphp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.coma3AaL.jpg altenter image description herep  pI want to do several things with this graph. p  ul liEvery node can have several attributes including name. It is not possible for me to display those attributes because of paucity of space. But as users mouse over or do other mouse based action I would like those attributes to show up as floating table which user can dismiss if not interested.li liNot all node attributes are integer or strings. It can be graphs as well. For example for one of the nodes I may have a bar chart showing how often this data entity is getting loaded in last 7 days. I would like that bar chart to float over as the user moves clicks mouse over that node. Currently I am using matplotlib to generate bar  pie charts associated please see above with nodes. I link those diagrams with my original directed graph using setURL in pydot.

This could prove problematic if the GPS is spewing out spurious amounts of data, as they do.p  pCan anyone comment as to the reason Im seeing odd serial outputp
Negative 1090 pI have a JSF 2 project and am using Eclipse Inigo as IDE, and deploying to Tomcat 6 which is running in a a virtual machine in VirtualBox to mimic the target environment. I am not using Eclipse to deploy. Right now Im simply exporting a .war file and deploying it from the Tomcat manager screen. I am using HSQLDB to store users, passwords, and user roles. One project requirement that is causing me confusion is that my web app must be fully selfcontained. That is to say, I deliver a .war file and they plug it in without additional configuration to Tomcat. p  pIve read a ton on configuring my project for form authentication, including a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2206911bestwayforuserauthenticationonjavaee6usingjsf20lq1SO question 1a, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14085881formbasedauthenticationinjsfrq1SO question 2a, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1331585jspwebapplicationformbasedauthenticationintomcatSO question 3a, a hrefhttptomcat.apache.orgtomcat6.0docrealmhowto.htmlDataSourceRealm relnofollowTomcat Realm configa, a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee6tutorialdocgkbaa.htmlbncbq relnofollowJava EE 6 securitya, and more. Those sources really helped understand how to configure my project. I thought I was almost there. However, when I deploy the web app and try to access a restricted page I always get the login error page. I attempt login with one of various users in the DB with the role required, and I think the DB is set up according to the a hrefhttptomcat.apache.orgtomcat6.0docrealmhowto.htmlDataSourceRealm relnofollowTomcat Documentationa.p  pAll the tutorials Ive read differ from my situation in one way or anotherp  ol liUses Glassfish instead of Tomcatli liUses codeBASICcode authentication instead of codeFORMcodeli liStores users, passwords, and roles in codetomcatusers.xmlcode instead of relational DB tablesli liDeclares roles in codeserver.xmlcode instead of somewhere within the .war file.li ol  pPoint 4 especially is preventing me from getting a full understanding of what is and is not possible out of the box.p  pI will edit this question later to post code codeweb.xmlcode, etc., but first I wanted to ask a question similar to the one in the SO question 2 above, in which the OP asks whether its possible to do form authentication without defining something in the application server. In one of the answers it sort of sounds like it is not possible, but its not quite definitive.p  pSo, is it possible to implement form authentication without modifying files in the server specifically codeserver.xmlcode and codetomcatusers.xmlcode as so many tutorials show Can form authentication with a codeDataSourceRealmcode be done with the requirement of the .war being fully self contained If so, how Can I include additional .xml files in my .war that would do the trick Can I include everthing I need in codeweb.xmlcode and codecontext.xmlcodep  pIve tried including everything in codeweb.xmlcode and codecontext.xmlcode, but it is not working. I thought I had things configured properly except for not having anything in the codeserver.xmlcode file.p  pIll leave it at that for now. If what I need is possible, Ill edit with code to try to figure out what Im doing wrong, otherwise, Ill save the trouble. Also, if what I need is not possible using form authentication, can anyone recommend a good alternative to achieve the same in a selfcontained .war Im throwing around the term selfcontained .war for lack of a better way to describe it...if theres a better or more precise term, let me know.p

Negative 1090 pI have a large list of forms that my company wants online and they require the forms be locked after the user fills them out and comes back to view their submission.  There are already a dozens of forms created using ASP.NET C web forms, so I was told to pick up where the last developer left off.  They created a separate page for viewing, submitting and editing the forms, so if a change comes in, I need to make the same change in multiple locations.  I would like to create a user control for each form so I can use the same page in all three spots but I started to think about where I was moving the work to.p  pThe first thing that came to mind was just doing an enabledisable on the fields and using CSS to style the displayed fields as text.  And removing the button to save at the bottom when viewing  This seems straightforward and I move the work for making a pretty form to the browser using JS and CSS.p  pNext, I looked at using a literal followed by the input field, switching the visibility to hide the input fields when a user is previewing a submission.  This doubled the number of controls on the page but I knew exactly which input went with which control.p  pMy third thought was dynamically building the page by using placeholders and adjusting as needed.  This looked nice because I could store all fields and types in a database, allowing for quick ordering and changing the form without needing to touch the code.p  pMy first idea seems to be the easiest but what is the difference in performance if .NET needs to build a form with 100 controls versus dynamically building the form  Is it better to build the entire page or most of it dynamically or have 100 placeholders and build just the areas that need to be dynamic  I dont want people to say Sure, you made it easier to modify the form but it takes 20 seconds to load the page.p  pbrbrp  h2emstrongUpdate 1emstrongh2  pTaking a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers1246391karlandersonkarlandersonas advice, I ran some tests.

Negative 1090 pIm trying to eliminate css modal windows modal windows are not mobile device best friends of a web client side application SPA, built with DurandalJS version 2.p  pI would like to convert the modal windows to full page dialogs. It would still be a dialog window but instead of superimpose the div over the current view, I would like to hide the current view while keeping its state and show the div containing the dialog using the entrance transition if possible or a similar technique  to keep a consistent flow.p  pI think I am close to a solution. The two options Im trying at the moment are using the dialog plugin as is by adding a new dialog context or creating a new plugin based on the dialog plugin. Either way, I am stock at the point where I need to hide the current view.p  pAny ideas how to go with this or how to determine the current active view from the compositionComplete hook inside a dialog contextp  pRelated question on the a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicdurandaljsqJQSSmNtao relnofollow titledsdsDurandalJS Google Groupsap  pstrongEdit 1strong following CodingGorilla commentsp  pUsing the entrance transition as is, is not the important part here. I could live with copying the code of the transition. But what is paramount, is that I should not navigate to a new view. The concept is exactly the same as a dialog in DurandalJS. The only difference is the presentation. A dialog should emnotem have a URL, it is contextual to the current statewindow.p

Negative 1090 pBefore asking, Ill make a small disclaimer Yes, I am aware differences between Virtual Memory, Physical Memory and Working Set. All the numbers below refer to the virtual memory.p  pThe situation is as follows We have a 32bit C app, which imports x86 C libraries with plenty of native dependencies, so migrating to x64 is not an option at the moment. The app loads a large dataset through the unmanaged component, and then tries to display it report.p  pHowever, when the dataset is particularly large, an OutOfMemory exception is thrown upon adding an item to the list, like in code belowp  pNo surprise here. However, what is surprising is the fact that the application still has around 280MB free VM.p  pWhen debugging pure unmanaged apps C, it was never the case  the badalloc could be only achieved if there was no free VM left, or if there was no free address space chunk of sufficient size.p  pHence, the question  what can be the reason of this I understand how to fight the issue  the unmanaged components really do eat a lot of memory, as well as create a lot of fragmentation  but what is the reason for OutOfMemoryException appearing so earlyp  pCode in question looks like thisp  precodeListltCellgt r  new ListltCellgtcols for int j  0 j lt cols j      r.Addnew CustomCell  The exception is thrown on this line  codepre  pAt the moment of exception, the list in one occurence had 85 items and its capacity was 200something the number of columns, as indicated in constructor. So, the exception most likely happened in CustomCell allocation. CustomCell object has many fields, but is certainly less than 1KB in total. The 280MB of free memory are located in chunks from 64KB to 14MB  so there should be plenty of space to allocate it.p

Negative 1090 pI am working on a javascript capable screenscraper using capybaradsl, selienium webdriver, and the spreadsheet gem. Very close to the desired output however two major problems arisep  ol lipI have not been able to figure out the exact xpath selector to filter out only the elements Im looking for to ensure that none are missing I am using a broad selector that I know will produce duplicate elements. I was planning on just calling .uniq on that selector but this throws an error. What is the proper way to do this results in the desired filtering. The error is an undefined no method for uniq. Maybe Im not using it properly coderesults  alla[containsonclick, analyticsLog].uniqcode. I know that the xpath that I have chosen to extract hrefs codea[containsonclick, analyticsLog]code will define more nodes than I intended because using find to inspect the page elements shows 144 rather than 72 that make up the page results. I have looked for a more specific selector however I havent been able to find one without filtering out some desired links due to the business logic used on the site.pli lipMy saveitem method has two selectors that are not always found within the info results, I would like the script to just skip those that arent found and save only the ones that are however my current iteration will throw a CapybaraElementNotFound and exit.

Negative 1090 pI have a UISplitViewController.  In the detail panel I have a UIToolbar at the bottom.  One of the BarButtonItems launches a UIPopoverController via a performSegue method.p  pThe popovers child view controller returns YES in its modalInPopover method.  Tapping outside of the popover does not close it, but tapping on any of the bar button items in the UIToolbar still performs the function of that bar button item even tho the popover is supposed to be modal.p  pIf I set NO for the modalInPopover, then clicks anywhere except for the bar button items will close the popover however, tapping on the bar button items will still work and the popover will remain visible.p  pThere are no passthru views set.   I cant understand how these bar buttons are still working when the popover is visible.  Any suggestions or insights would be welcomed.p

Negative 1090 pIm very new to Javascript and functions...Ive tried to go as far as I can this, but Im at a dead end.  What Im trying to do is allow users to use dropdown boxes to manually change the sort order of a dataset.  As an example, using the following datap  precodeName    SortOrder Bob     1 John    2 Mary    3 Susan   4 Frank   5 Allison 6 Katie   7 Scott   8 codepre  pLets say the user wants to display John at the top of the list and Susan as the second on the list.  When the user changes Johns SortOrder to 1, I want Bobs SortOrder to change to 2.  When Susans is changed to 2, I want Bobs to then change to 3 and Marys to change to 4.  Im emsoem close on this, but the list doesnt cooperate once a change or two have been made.  Here is my functionp  precodeltscriptgt function changeFieldnewval, oldval, maxfield, fieldid  var val  newval.value var oldval  Numberoldval var maxfield  Numbermaxfield for var i  1 i lt maxfield i      var curval  Numberdocument.getElementByIdsortorder  i.value     if val lt oldval          if curval gt val ampamp curval lt oldval ampamp fieldid  sortorder  i              document.getElementByIdsortorder  i.value  curval  1                           if val gt oldval          if curval lt val ampamp curval gt oldval ampamp fieldid  sortorder  i              document.getElementByIdsortorder  i.value  curval  1                             for var n  1 n lt maxfield n      var newfieldid sortorder  document.getElementByIdsortorder  n.value     document.getElementByIdsortorder  n.id  newfieldid       ltscriptgt codepre  pAnd here is the select boxp  precodeecho ltselect idsortorder . crow[catSortOrder] .  onchangechangeFieldthis,  . crow[catSortOrder] . ,  . numcat . , sortorder . crow[catSortOrder] . gt for v1 vltnumcat v  echo ltoption idoptid value . v . v  crow[catSortOrder]   selected  yes   . gt . v . ltoptiongt  echo ltselectgt codepre  pThe crow[catSortOrder] brings in the value from the SortOrder field Bob  1, John  2, etc.  numcat is the number of rows in the list in my example, 4.  So what Im passing in the function call is the new value after the field has been changed, the old value, the maximum number, and the select field id sortorder1, sortorder2, etc.p  pThe intent of the function is to change any applicable values between the old value and the new value.  As I stated before, if John is changed to 1, Bobs select option changes to 2.  If I move Susan up to 2, Bob then moves to 3 and Mary then moves to 4.  p  pThe last part of the function for n is meant to assign a new value to the id tag of the select boxes after a change has been made.  So when Johns value is changed to 1 and Bobs in turn changed to 2, the ids then update to sortorder1 and sortorder2, respectively.p  pCan anyone tell me what Im doing wrong here  Am I going about this the wrong way  I feel like Im so close but cant quite close this outp
Negative 1090 pAs of now, if I have to store something from Android to the server, I make an HTTP request of a codeGETcode URL, with data in the form of parameter values. On the server side, I use PHP to extract the parameter values and store them in database.p  pSimilarly, if I want to get something from the server to Android, I post a JSON string on the webpage using PHP.

Suppose I want to store the score of player from my game in Android to the servers database, it is easy to execute some URL like codewww.example.comsavescore.phpplayerid123ampscore999code from Android.

Negative 1090 pI have written a webbased application which handles contacts, orders, and permits to use this companys facilities.  We use an ACR122U interfacing with it via a Java Applet and javascript a hrefhttpndefeditor.grundid.de relnofollowhttpndefeditor.grundid.dea.p  pI have come to realize this was a bad idea, as it seems every week Firefox blocks the applet because 1. its an applet 2. its unsigned  3.  Java needs to be updatedp  pSo Im looking for a better way to interface with the ACR122U connected to each terminal via javascript.p  pOne idea I had was to write a chrome app wrapper for my app, but I dont know if this will give me the access to the ACR122U that I need without using the applet.

Negative 1090 pIm using codeBootstrapdatepickercode in multiselect  inline mode and I need to update it from the outside with some preselected dates.

Things Ive tried so farp  pstrong1.strongp  pcodeelement.datadatepicker.dates  myDatesArraycodep  pThis sets the dates but something weird happens, when the calendar is rendered all the dates I have set are displayed with a time offset of 3 hours keep in mind I do not need the time part of the date object. I have tried to do something like code.addHours3,0,0,0code on each date before feeding it to the control and something even weirder happens the dates are set as expected, but instead something happens which obviously I have no idea why and the control disables them. So the dates are selected and disabled at the same time, which is crap because the user cannot deselect them anymore.p  pstrong2.strongp  pI have found an SO question and tried something from there, likep  pcode.datepicker.datepickersetDate, new Date20140612code code.datepicker.datepickersetValue, 20140619.datepickerupdatecode code.datepicker.datepickerupdate, 20140629codep  pEach of these cause the datepicker to be rendered one more time. And if I have these inside a loop to go through all the dates in my array Im going to have as many calendars as selected dates.p  pstrong3.strongp  pI have also tried to create a method inside the control, something like its codebeforeShowDaycode, but that didnt work either, because the internal array the control is using isnt exposed at that time so I get some errors thrown at me.p  pIf needed I can add the angular directive, but I dont think its too relevant.p  pPS I dont know that much jQuery and I feel that something really obvious is staring in my face because I have seen a lot of comments from people that claim the 2nd method all of them actually work for them.

This is most definitely the quickest fix but it still leaves the possibility that IE7 doesnt work properly and it prints a table which makes no sense at all which happens under certain conditionsli liCreate a PDF file of the page multiple different size variations included to allow the user to export the size they require.  The problem with this is the time that I will need to invest to see how this can be done and to overcome any issues we have with very large tables.  This is by far the most risky in terms of investement  benefitli liThe third option is obviously to scrap the whole idea and change the logic of the page to not have a table but display the data in a different manner. This would preferably be avoided. li ol

Negative 1090 pIve been developing a C project in Visual Studio Express 2013 and came across a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd264808.aspxCode Contractsa for .NET languages. Impressed by their brevity and the static analysis tool that came with them, I started using them in my code base. However, when I attempted to run my program, I was met by an error message similar to the one found in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq18793558713961this SO threada, i.e.p  blockquote   p...An assembly probably ltmy projectgt must be   rewritten using the code contracts binary rewriter CCRewrite because   it is calling Contract.Requires and the CONTRACTSFULL symbol is   defined.  Remove any explicit definitions of the CONTRACTSFULL symbol   from your project and rebuild...p blockquote  pGuides suggest that to fix this, I have to enable Code Contracts from my projects Properties page, but a Code Contracts Properties entry is nowhere to be found in Express.p  pa hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSd64af157cd494a189ca1ab91e91e2e9fcodecontractsandvsexpressSome MSDN forum threadsa seem to indicate that all the tooling for Code Contracts is included in the Express version, but the Code Contracts Properties page is not. This seems to be the case, as I was able to run my project in VSE 2013 only after enabling Code Contracts with a copy of Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate I acquired from my university before graduating.p  pIs there really no way to work with Code Contracts in Visual Studio Express except by modifying the project files either manually or with a paid version of Visual Studio If this is the case, I am extremely hesitant to use them at all, since my company is unlikely to purchase VS licenses. Futhermore, it seems extremely odd that Microsoft would attempt to proliferate this new and superior verification paradigm but then restrict it to paying customers only.p

Negative 1090 pI have two ASP.NET websites, call them Older.com using ancient ASP.NET WebPages and Newer.com which is a combination of WebPages and MVC, with separate login systems. I would like to allow the user of Older.com to be able to link their accounts to an existing Newer.com account, or create an account with Newer.com, and I think I want to do it using OAuth.p  pAs I understand it, OAuth is generally used to allow users to login to a site using an existing account with the likes of Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc.. However, I might not want to use GoogleFBMSoft accounts to create an OAuth token, but instead use an Older.com password to generate token that also grants them Newer.com access. p  pBasically, would it make sense to do this using OAuth Do I have to use a link to an established provider GoogFBMSoft to use OAuth And, are there security issues I should be concerned about when using OAuthp  pAny advice, help, experience, or references are appreciatedp  peditp  pThe reason for this is that resources that used to be hosted on Older.com are being moved to Newer.com, because Older.com needs to be rebuilt and the Newer.com is designed around storing and linking related resources. You could think of Newer.com as a place where you can keep an article, but you can also keep all the things related to that article images, primary sources, derived works, whereas Older.com would just store a copy of the articles with no associated information.p

Negative 1090 pSo, I found this index reorderingoptimizer algorithm which is supposed to sort the triangles composing an arbitrary 3D mesh in a way that improves spatial locality, hopefully increasing performance in a realtime rendering application.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.combkaradzicbgfxblobmaster3rdpartyforsythtooforsythtriangleorderoptimizer.cpp relnofollowhttpsgithub.combkaradzicbgfxblobmaster3rdpartyforsythtooforsythtriangleorderoptimizer.cppap  pIm running into problems while testing it.p  pI exported Blenders Suzanne monkey mesh into a ply file and wrote myself a hideous testing program that reads the ply file, extracts the indices data, sorts them with the aforementioned algorithm and composes the reordered ply file, ready to be imported back in Blender to visually check the results... which arent promising at allp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0ycqP.png altright is the original mesh, left is the quotoptimizedquot onep  pA package with source and the test ply file is available herep  pa hrefhttpwww.mediafire.comdownload4nckwq8dezndsboforsyth.zip relnofollowhttpwww.mediafire.comdownload4nckwq8dezndsboforsyth.zipap  pThe only modification I applied to the original algorithm was to replace all instances of uint16 to uint, as my amigdala concluded that a 16 bit index list was an unnecessary limitation.p  pI post here the source anywayp  ptest2.cppp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include forsythtriangleorderoptimizer.h include ltmalloc.hgt  typedef struct  float coords[3] float normals[3] unsigned char color[3] char uv[2]  vert  typedef unsigned int uint typedef unsigned short uint16 typedef unsigned char byte   int main       FILE inply, facedump, reordered      vert buffv2      inplyfopensuzanne.ply,r  x y z nx ny nz r g b     facedumpfopensuzannereordered.txt,w      int vertices, faces, gg, line0, tt, startpos      extract verticesfaces totals.      line0     while 1          gggetcinply         if ggn line         if line3 fscanfinply, element vertex d, ampvertices         if line13 fscanfinply, element face d, ampfaces         if line16 break          printfvertices d , vertices     printffaces dn, faces      passthrough loop to reach indices data      for tt0 ttltvertices tt          fscanfinply, f f f f f f d d dn,             ampbuffv2.coords[0], ampbuffv2.coords[1], ampbuffv2.coords[2],             ampbuffv2.normals[0], ampbuffv2.normals[1], ampbuffv2.normals[2],             ampbuffv2.color[0], ampbuffv2.color[1], ampbuffv2.color[2]            startpos  ftellinply      uint indicesuintcallocfaces, 3sizeofint     uint newIndexListuintcallocfaces, 3sizeofint      for tt0 ttltfaces tt          fscanfinply, 3 d d dn, ampindices[tt], ampindices[tt1], ampindices[tt2]           call the reorder function      ForsythOptimizeFacesindices, uintfaces3, uintvertices, newIndexList, uint16      dump the reordered indices in a separate file      for tt0 ttltfaces tt          fprintffacedump, 3 d d dn, newIndexList[tt], newIndexList[tt1], newIndexList[tt2]           build new ply file with ordered indices      reorderedfopensuzannereordered.ply,wb     rewindinply      while1          gggetcinply         putcgg, reordered         if ftellinplystartpos break           for tt0 ttltfaces tt          fprintfreordered, 3 d d dn, newIndexList[tt], newIndexList[tt1], newIndexList[tt2]            freeindices     freenewIndexList      fcloseinply     fclosefacedump     fclosereordered      return 0  codepre  pforsythtriangleorderoptimizer.hp  precode   This is an implementation of Tom Forsyths LinearSpeed Vertex Cache   Optimization algorithm as described here   httphome.comcast.nettomforsythpapersfastvertcacheopt.html    This code was authored and released into the public domain by   Adrian Stone stonegameangst.com.

The idea was to track the percentile width of the tobe draggable bar separating the two panessections, and use codengstylecode to automatically update the widths of the two panes in relation to where that bar is dragged.p  pThe following is in a Rails app, with integrated Angular.

Negative 1090 pCurrently I am working on a small piece of code for a processor design assignment.p  pI know it normally would be bad practice, but for this assignment, since we are implementing an extremely specific functionality on a specialized processor, I have decided to make the processor datamemoryless. All data will be only in a FIFO from another processor, or in registers. It fits because the amount of data is small.p  pTherefore all the variables in my C code have the prefix register it tells the compiler to keep them in registers, which works fine.p  pC, however, does not allow defining global register variables, so all my variables were declared locally in the entry function.p  pA problem arises when I want to call another function from the entry function, which needs to operate on the same register variables. The second function cannot see them as they are local in the entry function. I cannot make these variables global see above, I cannot pass a pointer since registers arent addressable, so the only way I saw to do this is to actually pass all the variables to the second function in a struct, have the second function operate on them and return the new values to the first function in another struct.p  pThis seems like a very bad move because I dont think the compiler is smart enough to realize that actually, the second function should simply access the registers of the original variables directly. It results in lots of unneccessary register copying back and forth.p  pThe compiler Im using does not support nested functions like GCC. And because this is C, there are no classes possible.p  pIs there any other elegant way to get around this problemp  pThank you very muchp

Negative 1090 pIm using AngularJS and the nggrid module v3.0, ui.grid and as the title says, Im trying to activate the enableFiltering dynamically in a grid, but i cant and i dont know why. I can change the enableCellEdit behavior on the fly, but the same process doesnt seem to work for enableFiltering although they both are options equally.p  pCurrently, im trying to change the enableFilterings value this wayp  precodevar options  angular.copyscope.gridOptions[index]  options.enableFiltering  true  scope.gridOptions[index]  options  for  var i  0, j  scope.gridOptions[index].columnDefs.length i lt j i  1     scope.gridOptions[index].columnDefs[i].enableFiltering  true   scope.gridApi[index].core.refresh codepre  pIm creating a lot of grids, because of that im using arrays. The main problem is that the grid doesnt change. It happens nothing. Theoretically, enabling this option each column in the grid should show the input for filtering.p  pAny suggestionp  pThanks a lotp

I could create the two functionalities separately,i.e, I could embedd a button with an image on a Tkinter window and use the Scrollbar but was unable to call the same function with the previous Tkinter window.p  pThe code I am using is p  precodefrom Tkinter import   from ttk import   class VerticalScrolledFrameFrame     def initself, parent, args, kw         Frame.initself, parent, args, kw           create a canvas object and a vertical scrollbar for scrolling it         vscrollbar  Scrollbarself, orientVERTICAL         vscrollbar.packfillY, sideRIGHT, expandFALSE         canvas  Canvasself, bd0, highlightthickness0,                         yscrollcommandvscrollbar.set         canvas.packsideLEFT, fillBOTH, expandTRUE         vscrollbar.configcommandcanvas.yview           reset the view         canvas.xviewmoveto0         canvas.yviewmoveto0           create a frame inside the canvas which will be scrolled with it         self.interior  interior  Framecanvas         interiorid  canvas.createwindow0, 0, windowinterior,                                        anchorNW          def configureinteriorevent              update the scrollbars to match the size of the inner frame             size  interior.winforeqwidth, interior.winforeqheight             canvas.configscrollregion0 0 s s  size             if interior.winforeqwidth  canvas.winfowidth                  update the canvass width to fit the inner frame                 canvas.configwidthinterior.winforeqwidth         interior.bindltConfiguregt, configureinterior          def configurecanvasevent             if interior.winforeqwidth  canvas.winfowidth                  update the inner frames width to fill the canvas                 canvas.itemconfigureinteriorid, widthcanvas.winfowidth         canvas.bindltConfiguregt, configurecanvas   if name  main  class SampleAppTk      def initself, args, kwargs         from Tkinter import          print in constructor         import Tkinter         import ImageTk          import Image         import cv2         import numpy as np         import cv2.cv as cv         import math         import tkFileDialog         import tkMessageBox         import Tkinter as tk         root  Tk.initself, args, kwargs          def Print             print print function          self.frame  VerticalScrolledFrameroot         self.frame.pack         self.label  LabeltextShrink the window to activate the scrollbar.         self.label.pack          comparebuttonpath  comparebutton.jpg         imagecompare  Image.opencomparebuttonpath         imagecompare.thumbnail70,45         photocompare  ImageTk.PhotoImageimagecompare         button  tk.Buttonself.frame, width120, height40, imagephotocompare,fgblack,bgmedium turquoise, activebackgroundindian red,cursorhand2,bd6,reliefRAISED, compoundtk.LEFT, textCompare,command  Print         button.image  photocompare         button.packsideLEFT         buttons  []         for i in range10             buttons.appendButtonself.frame.interior, textButton   stri             buttons[1].pack  app  SampleApp app.mainloop codepre  pThe above written function gives a pretty good result. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3pX40.png altenter image description herep  pBut how do I call this function on a button click from another Tkinter window Changing the initial declaration of root to root  Tk instead of  root  Tk.stronginitstrongself, args, kwargs throws ap  precodeRuntimeError maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object.  codepre  pIf I try to keep the function in some other file and import it into my original Tk file and create the object of that class on a button click, the second file gets automatically called during complilation of the original Tk file.

I feel rather stupid, but I cant figure this out Im learning my very first language, and Im teaching myself Im homeschooled. Im practicing what Ive learned thus far Im using TeenCoder  Windows Programming about LinkedLists and classes. The program Im making is supposed to show a question with 3 answers. I created the question class without any errors or problems, then I created a LinkedList to hold all the questions the program would ask. Once again, no errors. Then I created a simple test question to add to the list. Thats where the problem is. It wont let me use my LinkedList. I realize that Ive probably made some stupidly simple mistake like I said, Im new to computer programming, but I cant figure it out. Thx   Ethan This is my first question p  pEdit Thanks. I figured out my problem the day after I posted this question. I should have been creating a method in my public partial class Form1  Form that would create my list of questions if that makes any sense. Thanks for all the answers, help, and advice.p

How can I display my codemessagecode contents at the bottom of the returned codedata.framecodep  pI have tried returning the message too, but to no availp  precodefoofunctioncars   returncars,messagehelp  codepre  pI notice that the codewarningcode and codestopcode functions both display their text at the end of the codedata.framecode, but I am wanting to display a message that is neither a warning nor an error, but just an FYI.p  pTo clarify, ideally, the message would be displayed when the function is called regardless of if the output is assigned to a variable name or not but it would not be displayed every time the resulting object is used. codefoocarscode should display the message, as should codeobjfoocarscode. But just codeobjcode should not.p

Negative 1090 pI am interested in programming a basic firewall that blocks packets according to userdefined rules.p  pBasically, I already programmed the part that deals with the rules and everything is okay, but now Im supposed to implement the firewall itself the hard part, I guess.p  pI searched a lot, and found a couple of links full of details e.g a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles3405DevelopingFirewallsforWindowsXP relnofollowthisa and a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa36651028vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowthisa. The second Windows Filtering Platform seems most relevant, now, there doesnt seem to be any data about ACTUALLY getting started, the code snippets in the site well, in this specific subject dont explain the subject all too well.p  pI would like to know simply how to block a packet matching a certain rule, so that includes a couple of stagesp  ol lipListening for ANY incoming packets, all ports, IPs and protocols.pli lipChecking if the packet matches the certain rules.pli lipIf it strongdoesstrong match, let it through. If it strongdoesntstrong, capture it and block it over there.pli ol  pNow, stage 2 is actually already programmed, I just need to match it according to stage 1 what classstructure is used to represent the packet. Im not sure about doing stage 1, and stage 3.p  pFirst, how do I even listen to ALL of the connections in the computerp  pSecond, how do I manage the packet I captured, letting it through OR blocking it.p  pHelp would be much appreciated.

Negative 1090 pI have a function that finds all multiple elements in a vector. If I send in code1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,3,7code it returns code1,2,3code.

Negative 1090 pI just started a project in a company, they had it hosted on Google App Engine and the app was developed in Java. The thing is that this code was totally unreadable. So Ive came to the conclusion that the best solution would be start it all over.p  pBecause it is a Facebook App, one approach would be to stop using Java and start using their available PHP SDK. But, Google App Engine still doesnt work well with PHP, we cant install Frameworks like Yii without workarounds, etc.p  pSo I think the best solution would be change the place that we are hosting the application. It needs to be a host for scalable PHP applications.p  pIve researched a little bit and found people talking about Pagoda and appfog.p  pDo you have any suggestions What is the best solution considering price, efficiency and also it needs to be easy to use.

Negative 1090 pIm attempting to build a website on my computer and Im having issues linking with my root directory from anywhere on the website. I know I can use code..code to go up 1 directory as many times as needed, but I need a way to link to my root directory without using the whole address so I can use absolute links to use in my PHP pages which I want to use all over my site for ease of editing. Ive been told that codecode will take me back to the root, but it isnt working on my computer. p  pHere is the address for my deepest file in my 3rd directory from the root a hrefhttplocalhostWebsite20FilescatsarticlesBlankCats2.php relnofollowhttplocalhostWebsite20FilescatsarticlesBlankCats2.phpap  pThe file I want is in strongWebsite Filesstrong in the middle.But thats a folder INSIDE localhost, which I believe is being used as the root. There is a file within Localhost called codetest.phpcode that I tried to link to to test whether LocalHost was being used as the root, but it didnt show up in BlankCats2.php where I tried it. does that make sense Somewhere in BlankCats2.php there should have been a sentence that said Php test for website, and it didnt show up. p  pAlso, Im using MAMP as my php localhost. If that helps anyone in anyway.p  pAm I doing something wrong, or is the problem with trying to link to a root directory on my computer p  pstrongEditstrong Ive changed my root directory to Website Files, and now some of my links are working, but others arent. p  pFor example, in my codeSocialMediaMenu.phpcode file which Ive included in my codeBlankCats2.phpcode page, using codeimagesfacebook.pngcode worked to locate the image. However, I cannot use codeSocialMediaMenu.phpcode to locate and include the php file, I have to use code....SocialMediaMenu.phpcode or it wont work. Also, I was able to link to my style page with codestyles.csscode from the save codeBlankCats2.phpcode page, but it wont work with my php pages. I was also able to make codeimageslogo.gifcode work. p  pSo basically I can use codecode to link to my codeimagescode directory, but not anything IN the root directory itself. For that I need to use code..code or code....code Maybe Ill just create a new directory just for php includes and see if that solves anything.p  pstrongEditstrong So I created a new directory called codePHPincludescode and I put all the files I want included elsewhere in there. codeheader.phpcode, codemenu.phpcode, etc. But when I went to use codePHPincludesheader.phpcode, it didnt work. p  pHowever I HAVE noticed that the elements that ARE working are codehtmlcsscode based. My codestyles.csscode is working, my codeimageslogo.gifcode is working. The only things NOT working are things Im trying to include with PHP, so I think it has something to do with how PHP works. Could that be the casep  pstrongEditstrong Aha codecode will NOT work with PHP, I found that out here a hrefhttpscsstricks.comphpincludefromroot relnofollowhttpscsstricks.comphpincludefromroota So I guess I will need to mess around with my PHP code in order for it to behave and do what I want it to do.

Negative 1090 pI have four categories on my line graph to designate quarters in an academic year  Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring  in that order.  The sort field used on the category field gives a numbered string value to each quarter, from 1 to 4.  Instead of coming out in the desired order, it comes out as Summer Winter Fall Spring instead.  Winter is 3 and Fall is 2, so I cant figure out what is wrong.  Ive looked at the data and verified the sort field is correctly matched.  I dont know what else to check.  This is SSRS Report Builder 3.0.  Thank youp

Negative 1090 pIve implemented public key authentication on my website to allow users to sign in without using a password. They can request a certificate once theyre signed in the normal way. In the backend, a new certificate is generated using a selfsigned server certificate. In the Apache config, the client side certificate is set to optional, in order to allow users to sign in without a certificate as well.p  pThis all works splendidly, but theres a problem when visiting the website from Safari. When the website is visited for the first time, the browser offers to use a Applegenerated certificate, and the default Safari option is to do so. My server is of course unable to verify this certificate, because it was signed by Apple and not my server. The result is that users get a certificate error and cant visit the website. If a user denies to use the Apple provided certificate, everything works as expected and the user is able to log in normally.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtQ1G3.jpg altSafari prompting to use Applesigned certificatep  pThe problem is, if the user clicks continue on the first visit using the Applesigned certificate, this is remembered in the keychain. This makes the website unaccessible unless one removes the entry in the keychain, which is a pain.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTgs1c.png altKeychain entryp  pDid anyone encounter this error, which makes it virtually impossible to work with public key authentication for the majority of peoplep
Negative 1090 pI have a table in my Apple Watch app with rows that include a WKInterfaceSwitch.  There are 10 rows of the same row controller, which includes a switch.  In other words, there are 10 switches in 10 different rows of a table where each row is an instance of the same row controller.p  pWhen a user touches a switch and changes its state, the action method is called, but a reference to the switch is not passed, only its new value. Similarly for WKInterfaceButton  unlike UIKit, no reference is passed.p  pSo how do I know which of the 10 switches or buttons was touchedp  pUnderstand that I cannot assign a different selector for the action of each switch because they are all in instances of the same class, namely the row controller.p  pIs it possible that it is just not possible p

Negative 1090 pstrongEdit for emphasisstrongp  pI live on the East coast and my fatherinlaw is on the West coast. Hes a coder himself, from way back, though hes never developed for OSX or iOS.p  pI want him to join my testing group for my iOS game.p  pApple has managed to make Testflight even worse and more unreliable than it used to be, so thats just not an option. And I say this because I tried it first, and four days later Im emstillem waiting for whoknowswhat to be approved before I can distribute it. On the flip side, Crashlytics got the app on his phone within a half hour of downloading the plugin.p  pSo I can use Crashlytics to get my game on his iPhone, but its a headtohead game that relies on the Game Center Sandbox mode. His phone isnt develoment enabled, so the Sandbox options dont appear for him in settings.p  pHow do I get the Sandbox options to show up on his phone p  pSuggestions to use Apples TestFlight are not an acceptable answer to this question. This question is specifically about how to enable these features without using TestFlight. p  pAt the time of writing, the Crashlytics distribution process beats Apples hands down you dont have to wait through an inexplicable review period, you dont have to crawl through arcane configurations for testers and builds and profiles and whos internal and whos external and etc etc, and best of all the app is available to distribute as soon as you compile it in XCode. emNo export process at allem.p  pSo, no, suggestions to use Testflight wont do. The only exception is if the only way to enable the GameCenter sandbox is to wrangle the first distribution through Testflight, and then do all the rest through Crashlytics. If so, so be it. But Im strongemreallyemstrong hoping someones found another way.p  pstrongEdit for to be clear Im not paid by Crashlyticsstrongp  pIm not married to Crashlytics either, though If theres a different method thats superiorand emnotem Testflightplease suggest itp

We tried giving it some time a few minutes but the app doesnt get past this method. The research zone rectangleLyon is a rectangle which covers the city of Lyon, France, and some of the surroundings. This is not so big a zone, and there arent too much boulevards, so wed think that a search for boulevard in it would return a result pretty quickly. We suspect that our GoogleApiClient might not be configured right, but it can connect, since we pass in the method that is called only through OnConnected, and a bad request wouldnt have returned the PendingResult in the first place, right p  pCan you see any reason why this code stucks in results.await p  pThank you p

Negative 1090 pIve got a 3D solid, represented as the union of a set of polyhedral convex hulls. Or a single convex, if that makes things easier. Id like to approximate that solid as the union of a set of spheres, in a way which minimizes both the number of spheres in the set and the error in the approximation. The latter objective is deliberately vague any reasonable error metric will do. Likewise, the way in which the objectives are combined is up in the air either the number of spheres or the error metric could be constrained, or some function of the two could be minimized. I dont want to specify myself into a corner.p  pThe approximation does not need to entirely contain emorem be entirely contained by the original set. Each sphere may have an arbitrary radius.p  pThis feels like the sort of problem thats NPcomplete, and in any case unlikely to be practical using exact methods, so Im assuming the solution lies in the realm of stochastic optimization. It feels like some variant of kmeans might fit assigning uncovered locations to their closest spheres, and refining the spheres to cover some of them, but Im not sure how to handle multiplycovered locations, or how to find the local, notnecessarilycoveringeverything optimum even for a single sphere. Also, for iterative methods efficiency is important, and doing 3D boolean operations is emnotem going to be efficient.p

Negative 1090 pWe are working on an Android app that makes GATT connection to BLE devices and writes some characteristics. Our current approach is to scan for devices startLEScan on Android 4.3 and 4.4. devices and startScan on Android 5.0 every few seconds and connect to device when discovered. p  pThis solution works but it drains a lot of battery because we need to keep wake locks or trigger alarm manager every few seconds for the scanning to work when the phone is in sleep. p  pIs there an way that Android can notify the app when the BLE device is discovered instead of continuously scanning for devicesp  piOS app works great because iOS wakes the app in background when there is any BLE device nearby, which saves a lot of battery.  Wondering it there is something similar on Android to keep the battery under acceptable limit.p  pJust for reference, we have also tried the a hrefhttpsgithub.comAltBeaconandroidbeaconlibrary relnofollowAltBeacona library but found  that it internally usages alarm manager and if we set alarm manager to trigger every 5 seconds, it consumes 78 battery every hour.p

Negative 1090 pEverything seems to be running fine if we have Flume listening in on message queue.  The files are picked up by both logger sink and hdfs sink.  p  pThe problem arises when we have a queue with lets say 50 messages backed up on it.  We start flume up and have it pull off the backed up queue.  The messages get picked up and the logger sink logs all 50 but the hdfs sink only flushes 1 file containing the very last message.p  pWe have tried tweaking all sorts of settings but to no avail.  Below is my .conf file.

Negative 1090 pI am attempting to write a Chrome App that will transfer files from any Android or iOS device plugged into the machine through USB. Im only working with a Google Nexus 7 and 5 device at the moment. Using the Chrome USB API, I can successfully connect to a device, and I have access to the list of all of its interfaces, and within each interface I have access to a list of all endpoints for that interface. I can claim the interface, and I am about to do a bulk transfer. p  pI want to find a particular directory that I know the name of, and copy that directory with all of its files and subdirectories, and their files and subdirectories, to the host machine.p  pBut, Im not sure how to go about it. Which interface do I use Which endpoint within that interface do I use I have to pass in the length of the data that I want to read from the bulk transfer, but I wont be able to determine the directoryfile size before doing the transfer. How do I know the length of data to read in Once I get my data back, how do I convert it into a directoryfile format that I can then usep

Negative 1090 pI am starting with Arduino AVR based cheap platform programming. I managed to properly setup basics like compiling under QtCreator, USB simulated serial terminal etc.. Made it with CASM intgration. Recently I have run into some strange behaviour of GCC linker and after 2 days of googling I am giving up and posting question here.p  pTask, I want to achive, is quite simple to make some configuration data containing variable lenght, zero terminated strings  thus NOT declarable as array of structs be placed in separate RAM address block, to allow for separate reprogramming of this block by AVR bootloader. I need the above AND SAME TIME use emgcsectionsem linker parameter to eliminate all the unused code. When I tried to place emgcsectionsem in the initial link command contained in nonmodified Arduino.mk default file, I ended up with COMPLETELY empty .elf file. Maybe this way is opened an I made just some stupid mistake, but I decided to go another way.p  pCurrently I use twophase linking, first producing normal emmain.elfem via default emmake allem, second phase runs the command strongemavrgcc nostdlib mmcuatmega328p T ..LinkerScript.txt o mainavr.elf main.elfemstrong , referencing to emLinkerScript.txtem to arrange memory map, and producing emmainavr.elfem file. To later derive .hex from .elf is piece of cake.p  pEverything goes pretty well, besides, that some addresses are relocated to for first watch strange addresses out of FLASH memory range. On the second look I found, that the addresess are EXACT double of addresses in the original main.elf file. So I expect that this could have something to do with 2 bytes  1 byte memory organization. Moreover I observed, that impacted registers are those of type d and b in avrnm table, while D and B retains their original value. However was not able to find more, not even description of some configuration about this in gcc linker or linker scripts documentation.p  pBelow are posted linker script used  and lists of symbols from main.elf and mainavr.elf.

Negative 1090 pI am new to the R programming language and want to sorry for this kind of easy question and have dealed the code of the collatz conjecture in R. Actually, I have fully understood the first two parts, but I dont the logic of the while loop in Part 3 and what is the need of n.total lt NULL. In addition, I dont understand the reason why it is combining the whole set as a vector in the last step with cn.total,n.

Negative 1090 pIve found a lot of questions and answer about my problem but no real good solution. So here it isp  p1 Ive a web server using PHP and TCPDF. I create PDF on the fly. p  p2 On my web site, I told Apache to call a special piece of code in case of error. Using that, each time there is an error, I receive a mail with IP, id of the browser and so on.p  pI notice that when Ive user using an Android phone or tablet, each time they download a PDF, they receive the file, can display it, but I get an error 500.  All is perfect in all cases PC, Mac, Linux, using Chrome, Firefox, Safari.. even on iPhone. The problem exist only under Android. After searching I found some doc about the problem of HTTP header. So Ive made some test using an Android tablet. It run under Android 4.2.2 but somes users have different version and result are the same. Here are the strange resultsp  pstrongcase 1strongp  precode headerContentType applicationpdf  headerContentDispositioninlinefilename.basenamename. codepre  pResult Error 500 on the server, the tablet display a message indicating the file will cause problem to the tablet great for the user... and this message seems not to get the right file name the tablet always name the file pdf.pdf. A Cancel and OK button are available. If you select Cancel you dont get the file. While choosing OK you get the file with name pdf.pdf. In both cases Cancel or OK, my server get an ERROR 500. Notice that having a space before inline or writting .PDF rather than .pdf as extension give no change.p  pstrongcase 2strongp  precode headerContentType applicationoctetstream  headerContentDispositioninlinefilename.basenamename. codepre  pIn that case, the tablet dont display any message. The file is correctly downloaded, always with pdf.pdf as name so the original name is not used, and I get the ERROR 500.p  pstrongcase 3strongp  precode headerContentType applicationoctetstream  headerContentDispositionattachmentfilename.basenamename. codepre  pIn that case, I get the message on the tablet saying the file will cause problem. But in this case the file name is correct. I get the Cancel and OK button. Clicking on OK, I get the file with the correct name.... and also the Error 500. If I send test.PDF as name, and I get test.PDF as name remember this for next casep  pstrongcase 4strongp  precode headerContentType applicationpdf  headerContentDispositionattachmentfilename.basenamename. codepre  pIn that case, I get the message on the tablet, with the Cancel and OK button. But  even if I send the same name than on case 3 so test.PDF, the message talk about test.pdf  And when clicking on OK, I get the file with the name extension in stronglower casestrong And, of course, I get the Erro 500...p  pIm looking for a way to get the right name on the tablet, avoid the user message and avoid the Error 500... p  pAny ideap  pEdit juste another point. The fact that, in case 1 and 2, the pdf file dont have the right name came from the fact Android seem to blend the name of the page PHP with the extension pdf. Eg. I use a page name compose.php in order to generate a file name statistic.pdf, when Android display its message, it wil talk about compose.pdf. p  pEdit2 another bad detail. Checking the browser name id to send a different header in case of Android is not possible. For example, the Foston Chinese Android tablet send, for its browser, a useragent saying the tablet is an iPad. And the useragent dont contain the word Android...p

Negative 1090 pI Have the following setup in mind Kubernetes on Mesos based on the kubernetesmesos project within a 16 network. Each pod will have its own IP and I believe this will avail 64 000 pods. The idea is to provide isolation for each app i.e. Each app gets its own mysql within the same pod  the app accesses mysql on localhostwithin the pod. If an additional service were needed, Id use kubernetes rolling updates to add the services container to the pod, the app will be able to access this new service on localhost as well. Each application needs as much isolation as possible.p  ol liAre there any defects to such an implementation li liDo I have to use weave   ul liTheres an option to specify the serviceiprange while running the kubernetesmesos install.li ulli liOne hole is how do I scale a service, is this really viable li liIs there a better way to do this i.e. Offering isolated servicesli ol  pThanks.

Negative 1090 pI am building a Calculator app which uses a parser that is called DDMathParser. It can evaluate a string such as 231 and outputs 4 as the answer. However, if I put something like 33 or log5 instead of log5, the app crashes which is expected the error message is like invalid format blah blah blah... fatal error unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value. I am wondering if there is a way to handle these kind of error to prevent the app from crashing I mean if the user input 33, the app will output an error message on a textview box or nothing, as long as it doesnt crash the app... Thanks in advancep  pEdit The code is str.numberByEvaluatingString.doubleValue where str is a string like 324 or ln3 etc... and numberByEvaluatingString is a function from DDMathParser.

Negative 1090 pUsing only PHP6 no Javascript, there have been numerous failed attempts to format a plain text email.  The primary issue seems to be either  1. the failure to successfully construct returns and line breaks in the email text andor,  2. the use of a malformed character set charset parameter. p  pYour help in resolving this matter would be appreciated. Earlier failed attempts included copying and pasting several relevant code snippets found via searching StackOverflow. Subsequent failed attempts can be seen  commented and otherwise  in the code provided here.  Note that the email data is extracted via PHP6 in the head section of the HTML5 document from the simple HTML5 form also provided here.  The PHP6 and the HTML5 occur in a single [1] file.  p  pPlease note that both the code and the HTML5 were originally indented properly when copied to paste here.p  pThe questions asked here are different than the doublesingle quotation mark matter, but consistently using the doublesingle quotes where appropriate does help part of the problem.  For example, a duplicate email is sent when the browsers refresh button is clicked in Firefox, even thoug the form data is cleared and the submit button is not clicked again.  There is also the matter of the earlier referenced character set i.e., which is more universally accepted by email services.p  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt  lthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtLearning PHP6lttitlegt   ltphp      fielddisplayfeedback      echo Inside PHP and about to enter IF fielddisplayfeedback    . fielddisplayfeedback .   ltbr gt     if issetPOST[SubmitButton]              fieldsuggestion  POST[YourSuggestion]        fieldname  POST[YourName]       fieldphone  POST[YourPhone]       fieldemail  POST[YourEmail]        headersubject  Suggestion Submission       headerto  JMJustMe.com       headerfrom  From Just Me ltJMJustMe.comgt . rn        headerfrom .
