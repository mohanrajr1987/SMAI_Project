Positive 72364 pI have done bunch of projects using ZF2 and Doctrine2.

Positive 72364 pIs there a tutorial or example for building a form with ZF2 and Doctrine that can update more than one record at a timep  pFor example, lets say that we want to create a form in the Album module that lists a group of albums and each album in the list has a check box for a new field called favorites.  How do we configure the form and the controller to update each of the records where the user checked the box, perhaps triggered by an event like pressing an update buttonp

Positive 72364 pI am creating an apigility project where we will be hosting all of our APIs.  We need to be able to use OAuth2 for authentication but we cannot figure out how to control access to certain APIs, it seems like once a client authenticates, they can use any of our APIs but we want to limit them to use only specific ones that we define. After reading about the OAuth2 library that apigility uses, I saw that there are scopes that can be defined but I have not found any documentation about how to check a users scope to see if they have access. I want to find out if this is the best way to restrict access to certain APIs and how to set it up if it is, or is there a better way to control accessp

Positive 72364 pI am creating my first Zend Framework2 Project. My page offers the option to create adverts. I now want to offer the option to bookmark an advert. What needs to be done is that when you are on the page of the advert, the site will check if you are logged in and if you are it will check if the advert is already bookmarked and display the message otherwise it will offer you a link to add the advert to your bookmarks. This link will also be shown when you are not logged in and if you click on in, you will then be redirected to the Login Page.p  pAnyway, to achieve the above target, I have created a View Helper, which gets created by a BookmarkAdvertFactory. I have also created a BookmarkAdvertService, which checks the current Bookmark status. For that I need the UserId and the AdvertId. p  pIn my module.php I inject the userEntity to be able to get the UserId in the BookmarkAdvertService, but now I am not sure how to access the AdvertId from the Service.

Negative 72364 pI inherited a database built with the idea that composite keys are much more ideal than using a unique object ID field and that when building a database, a single unique ID should bemneveremb be used as a primary key.  Because I was building a Rails frontend for this database, I ran into difficulties getting it to conform to the Rails conventions though it was possible using custom views and a few additional gems to handle composite keys.p  pThe reasoning behind this specific schema design from the person who wrote it had to do with how the database handles ID fields in a nonefficient manner and when its building indexes, tree sorts are flawed.  This explanation lacked any depth and Im still trying to wrap my head around the concept Im familiar with using composite keys, but not 100 of the time.p  pCan anyone offer opinions or add any greater depth to this topic  p

Negative 72364 pHi Guys to facilitate lazy loading on our WCF Services that use AR I created a Session Scope PerRequest solution for WCF.p  p[edit] Ok so I put the question on the end  so bear with me and start reading at the end.  [edit]p  pIf you want to use ActiveRecord in a website or webservice you have to tell it via the configuration it is running in a web envirnoment. p  pHow ever it assumes it will have a HttpContext.Current which doesnt exsist in WCF. p  pSo we tell AR to use our own implementation of AbstractThreadScopeInfo which also implements IWebThreadScopeInfo to tell it it is compatible with the Session per Request pattern which becomes a Session per Session pattern today.p  pAdded some fixes to lazy loading exception I ran into from a hrefhttpwww.developerfusion.comcommunityblogentry8214605castleactiverecordmoreonlazyloadingandsessionscopes relnofollowhereap  precodepublic class WCFThreadScopeInfo  AbstractThreadScopeInfo, IWebThreadScopeInfo       public static readonly ILog Logger  LogManager.GetLogger typeof WCFThreadScopeInfo      private readonly object syncLock      public WCFThreadScopeInfo              syncLock  new object            public new void RegisterScope ISessionScope scope              CurrentStack.Push scope           public new ISessionScope GetRegisteredScope               if CurrentStack.Count  0                      Instead of returning a null stack as is in the original ActiveRecord code,              instantiate a new one which adds itself to the stack immediately             lock syncLock                              if CurrentStack.Count  0                                      new SessionScope                                                 return CurrentStack.Peek  as ISessionScope           public new void UnRegisterScope ISessionScope scope              if GetRegisteredScope   scope                      throw new ScopeMachineryException Tried to unregister a scope that is not the active one                  CurrentStack.Pop            public new bool HasInitializedScope              get  return GetRegisteredScope   null             region Overrides of AbstractThreadScopeInfo     public override Stack CurrentStack              [MethodImplMethodImplOptions.Synchronized]         get                      Lets use the OperationContext instead of the HttpContext             OperationContext current  OperationContext.Current              Which offcourse cant be null             if current  null                 throw new ScopeMachineryException Could not access OperationContext.Current              Get the first WCF StackContainer from the OperationContext or null             WCFStackContainer stackContainer  WCFStackContainercurrent.Extensions.FirstOrDefault ex gt ex is WCFStackContainer              If the previous statement didnt find any add a new one to the OperationContext             if stackContainer  null                              Logger.Debug Creating new WCFStackContainer                 stackContainer  new WCFStackContainer                  current.Extensions.Add stackContainer                           In the end return the stack in the container             return stackContainer.Stack                   endregion  codepre  pAs you can see above we need a WCFStackContainer which can be added to the current OperationContext.Extensions.

Negative 72364 pIm using R, and Im a beginner. I have two large lists 30K elements each. One is called codedescriptionscode and where each element is maybe a tokenized string.

Negative 72364 pI probably just havent thought this through, or perhaps Im simply unaware of an already existing option in Subversion Im certainly no expert.p  pIm just wondering, if Ive created a branch to start working on some new feature, if theres an easier way to keep the branch up to date with the emtrunkems most recent revisions without having to go through all the trouble of merging a range of revisions. I would like to be able to simply update and get all revisions from the trunk emandem the branch, of course, while my committed changes only affect the branch. Is this possible Does what Im asking make sensep  pI suppose this isnt really necessarily different from merging a range of revisions its just that I use AnkhSVN, which performs all these bestpractice checks before allowing a merge, and sometimes it feels like its a lot more complicated than it needs to be. The idea is that I want to keep my branch uptodate with any commits other developers may be making to the trunk so that when I eventually emdoem merge my branch into the trunk, everything goes as smoothly as possible.p
Negative 72364 pSuppose I have a Window with TextBoxes I want to use the values. Right now Im thinking of eitherp  p1 Updating each associated value once the cursor is out of focus, and once the user presses Ok I start the programbr 2 Once the user presses Ok, I retrieve all the values at once then start the programp  pIm not sure which one is better though. First alternative seems more modular, but theres more semantic coupling since I each new box is supposed to be updating its respective value.p  pI realize this isnt all that important, but Im trying to understand when to centralize and when not to. Other better approachers are appreciated too.p

Negative 72364 pIm the part time FTP server administrator with no real fulltime admin. We currently only allow ACTV mode connections. Some of our clients have had issues with this but for the most part theyve been ok using ACTV. For the few who arent, weve been able to push the data over to their servers from ours.     there is one client in particular however who is currently having trouble. He is using filezilla and issuing a PORT command.

Im sure this reflects my own misunderstanding of how modrewrite redirects interact with PHP, but  it seems like I should be able to do this one way or another.p  pThanks in advancebr Cheers,br Chrisp

I have a file of DNA data that is 5,905 lines long, with 32 fields per line.  The fields are not delimited by anything and vary in length within the line, but each field is the same size on all 5905 lines.p  pI need each line fed into a separate array from the file, and each field within the line stored as its own variable.  I am having no problems storing one line, but I am having difficulties storing each line successively through the entire file.p  pThis is how I separate the first line of the full array into individual variablesp  precodemy SampleID  substrHorseArray, 0, 7 my PopulationID  substrHorseArray, 9, 4 my Allele1A   substrHorseArray, 14, 3 my Allele1B  substrHorseArray, 17, 3 my Allele2A   substrHorseArray, 21, 3 my Allele2B  substrHorseArray, 24, 3 codepre  p...etc.p  pMy issues are  1 I need to store each of the 5905 lines as a separate array.  2 I need to be able to reference each line based on the sample ID, or a group of lines based on population ID and sort them.p  pI can sort and manipulate the data fine once it is defined in variables, I am just having trouble constructing a multidimensional array with each of these fields so I can reference each line at will.

Negative 72364 pHey guys. Were using OSGi services in an Eclipse RCP application. To track them, were using the codeorg.osgi.util.tracker.ServiceTrackercode class. A sample code from the application looks likep  precodemailServiceTracker  new ServiceTrackercontext, MailService.class.getName, null mailServiceTracker.open MailService service  MailService mailServiceTracker.getService codepre  pNow my problem is that the codegetServicecode method frequently returns codenullcode when I created a new service. The code works very well for services that are existing for a long time in the application, but each time I create a new service, I have to do many things until the service is finally found and tracked. I regularly try for examplep  ul liClean... in Eclipseli liRefresh all projects in Eclipseli liRebuild the project on the command lineli ul  pSometimes those things help, and sometimes they dont. Does anyone have experiences with those trackers and can tell me how to avoid this behavior and how to get the services tracked immediately upon creationp  pThanksp
Negative 72364 pI have written an android app which listens to the phone signal strength using PhoneStateListener.SignalStrengthChangedint asu.

Negative 72364 pIm creating my own recipe box using phpmysql and one part Im stuck on is actually creating the recipes, specifically selecting the ingredients.p  pWhat I wanted to do instead is have a autocomplete search box where I can type out names of the ingredients, have the results drop down right below, and click the ones Im looking for. After clicking the ingredient, itll be listed below the search box with an input to put quantity and an x to delete if needed. This of course would grow depending on how many ingredients the recipe requires. At the end, I would just take the data and do an insert into my database.p  pIve seen a lot of AJAX tutorials on getting the autocomplete search box functionality, but nothing tying it to the value selection.

Negative 72364 pI maintain a web application that is painful to upgrade.  Its not painful because the code is bad, but because there are a lot of devices connected to this application via the web and getting them to update their clients is a lot like moving concrete.p  pSo I had an idea that I could simply present a different version of the application to different customers.  The session stores the client information.

Negative 72364 pJust started using GIMP today. When I resize the canvas manually in GIMP so that its smaller than the image size it lets me move the image around so that I can change the viewable area. How do I replicate this in a script In other words, I want the script to pause at the canvas resizing step and let me position the image correctly.p  pThe reason Im asking Ive written a small script that will create square thumbnails of images. The way Im doing this is by resizing the canvas so that the height and width are the same. If the height and width are different I change the higher of the two so that it is the same as the lower e.g. 600x500 becomes 500x500. I then flatten the image and scale it to whatever I need.p  precodeif gt width height     begin         gimpimageresize image height height 0 0          begin         gimpimageresize image width width 0 0       codepre  pThe code Im using to resize the canvas is above.  I know the last two values in the gimpimageresize command refer to the offsets. This is what I want to manually modify when the script reaches this step. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 72364 pWorking on my assignment for Java and I have created a class called Triangle. This has 3 variables, side1, side2 and side3. My constructor method takes 3 float values and assigns them to each variable in turn. p  pMy issue is if the user puts in 10,11.1,12.2 those are taken as int,double,double and not the float that I require the assignment says the 3 sides must be float values.p  pSo how can I convert each input into a float regardless of if its an integer or double when inputtedp  pThanks,p  pJack.p

Negative 72364 pstrongSOLUTIONstrong emI did not specify the constructor parameters on the new type so .NET assumed the types of the base class, however it does not also name them the same so when Unity tried Parameter[x].Name it got a Null value instead of a parameter name.emp  pSorry to use the U word, but this really is a problem I need to urgently fix this problem to resolve a massive memory leak elsewhere long story. So if anyone can help with this I will really appreciate itp  pI am dynamically creating a type at runtime using Reflection.Emit.  The dynamic type descends from a base type specified at runtime, and implements IController.  The purpose is to wrap the call to IController.Execute with a try...finally and dispose of an object.p  pHere is what is odd.

Negative 72364 pI am working on some Eclipse projects that are stored on a USB key. I have added them to a workspace whose root folder is also on the USB key, but the projects are not located directly into this directory. As a result their absolute paths are written in the .projects folder of the workspace.p  pThis raises problems when I use the key on several computers, because the drive letter assigned to the USB key is not always the same and I do not want to assign a specific letter to it on all computers. Eclipse cannot open my projects when the drive letter differs from that of the USB key at the time I added the project to the workspace.p  pIs there a solution to this problem  Specifically, is there a way to make Eclipse add projects to a workspace by using their relative path from the workspace folder p

Is that somehow okay If so, whyp  pWe 7 people and I are planning to use the Play framework for a project involving a web app. We decided to do it with Play because it looks quite fun to do, all of us already know Java and the assignment is pretty hard so we wanted to focus on the actual assignment rather than also learning how to program in a different language.p  pWe were always told, however, emNEVER EVERem to use statics in any Java program we developed, but when I look at Play ... Well... about half the methods are static. ltexaggerationgtp  pI suppose, at the very least, we could use singleton objects by using Scala, for example  in order to program our project, but Im quite concerned at how many statics there actually are in framework itself.p  pSo, should I be concerned about this Did the way the Play developers programmed it make it so that all these statics dont pose a problemp  pFor example, a hrefhttpwww.allegro.ccforumsthread586752 titlethis threadthis threada has a rant about why static members should be avoided at all costs.p

Negative 72364 pI need more insight to how the eBay api works... I have looked at many examples in php codes within there site BUT they keep using different techniques each time and is not straight forward at all..  Ive downloaded the emebaySession.phpem and emkeys.phpem files..  I have successfully integrated the strongebaysessionstrong class and have made contact with ebay.  But how to use the emsendHttpRequestem method confuses me.  There is no explanation to how to get a user account information.p  pMany tutorials also show that the constructor for the strongeBaySessionstrong class has the request token as the last parameter whereas my file has User token as the first parameter.  There are many inconsistencies with the API documentation from eBay. I have a test user account with a token in place...p  pWhat I also dont understand is why strongeBaySessionstrong constructor requires the emUserTokenem amp emcallnameem when in ebays examples the call name and usertoken was included in an XML string...p  pA SIMPLE question that I cannot see a clear answer within the eBay docs, How do i make a simple call then retrive the results  response in a variable  I have achieved this with a simple search query, but cant seem to get it working when it requires user information and authentication...  ALSO the search example that eBay had uses a URL type query eg.p  precode Construct the findItemsByKeywords HTTP GET call apicall  endpoint apicall . OPERATIONNAMEfindItemsByKeywords apicall . ampSERVICEVERSIONversion apicall . ampSECURITYAPPNAMEappid apicall . ampGLOBALIDglobalid apicall . ampkeywordssafequery codepre  pThen another example usesp  precodeBuild the request Xml string requestXmlBody  ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gt requestXmlBody . ltFetchTokenRequest xmlnsurnebayapiseBLBaseComponentsgt requestXmlBody . ltSessionIDgttheIDltSessionIDgt requestXmlBody . ltFetchTokenRequestgt codepre  pThat XML code was put in the emsendHttpRequestem method. Why there was another example that did the same which had a emauthTokenem inside the XML yet the emauthTokenem was defined within the class constructor...p  pAny general advice on using the eBay PHP API would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 72364 pI have a codeUITextViewcode with some text in it. I want to show information about a word when you click it. I think the best way to do this is to use codeclosestPositionToPointcode and codeFirstRectForRangecode from the codeUITextInputcode protocol. After researching for a while I only found examples that use this methods in combination with codeCoreTextcode, and not with normal text, like in the codeUITextViewcode.  Now I wonder, can you use codeclosestPositionToPointcode and codeFirstRectForRangecode without using codeCoreTextcodep

Negative 72364 pI know its possible to get IDE autocompletion from the Table classes in Doctrine by doing things like thisp  precodeSomethingTablegetInstancegtltautocompletegt codepre  pBut the most important part is missing.  I want autocomplete on the model classes themselves, not just the emTable classes.  It appears that Doctrine is not properly declaring the PHPdoc return object types in the findem and other standard model methods.p  pFor example what I want to be able to do is thisp  precodesomething  SomethingTablegetInstancegtfindid somethinggtltautocompletegt  codepre  pand have that pop up the methods and properties of the Something class.p  pI should mention too that I dont specifically care about using the SomethingTablegetInstance syntax at all.  ANY decent syntax thats standard Symfony is acceptable.  Most of the time Im fetching objects or DoctrineCollections via custom queries like thisp  precodesomethings  DoctrineQuerycreate                 gtfromSomething s                 gtleftJoins.SomethingElse s2                 gtwhere... codepre  pBy the way, in case its not clear, Im asking if theres any automatic solution to this with ANY of the various Doctrine find, fetch or query syntaxes. Im NOT asking how to manually edit all the PHPdoc headers to cause the behavior I want. p  pIm using NetBeans 6.9.1 and Symfony 1.4.12 with Doctrine, but not everyone working on the same code uses NetBeans.p
Negative 72364 pI know there are lots of questions with this title but I could find one which could clearly help me decide.

Since there are nonprogrammers involved in the project i need the version control software you suggest to have a userfriendly gui to keep others from whining and make them shareevery thing theyve produced through version control. While searching up until now I think I prefer to use SVN or GIT but Im wondering which one suits our goals the best, can you suggest anything and I know about tortuisSVN and tortoisGIT p

Negative 72364 pI have a stored procedure which takes under a second to run normally.  Users wanted data from another table in that query, so I merged that data in with a UNION ALL and a bunch of dummy columns that were missing in the new table.p  pIt worked fine in testing, but when we deployed it to an SQL 2000 Server, it started getting timeouts.  The old query runs in under a second, and the 2 new queries both run in under a second, but when theyre combined using UNION ALL, the query times out.p  pHeres the general idea of how the query looks. The real query has about 20 input parameters and returns about 30 or 40 columns, but this should give the basic ideap  precodeCREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SearchHistory      Criteria1 bigint,     Criteria2 int,     Criteria3 varchar10  AS BEGIN      Part 1     SELECT         A,         NULL AS B,         0 AS C,         D     FROM TableA     WHERE Criteria1 IS NULL     AND Criteria3 IS NULL     AND A  Criteria2 OR Criteria2 IS NULL  UNION ALL       Part 2     SELECT         A,         NULL AS B,         0 AS C,         E     FROM TableA     WHERE Criteria1 IS NULL     AND Criteria3 IS NULL     AND A  Criteria2 OR Criteria2 IS NULL  UNION ALL       Part 3     SELECT         A,         B,         C,         D     FROM TableB     WHERE F  Criteria1 OR Criteria1 IS NULL     AND A  Criteria2 OR Criteria2 IS NULL     AND G  Criteria3 OR Criteria3 IS NULL END codepre  pIn the above example, Criteria1 is not null, so Part 1 and 2 will return 0 rows, and part 3 is only returning 3 rows.  But if I comment out Part 1 and 2, it finishes immediately if I leave them in, I get a timeout.  p  pHow do you convince SQL Server to not mess around with its execution plan in a situation like thisp

Negative 72364 pUsing PHPmysql I implemented a form for saving in the db a time in unix format using the function mktime. The view form displays the time in a readable format using date function. Only now I discovered that I was using local time and not GMT UTC time as requested. The changes are quite easy in the sw changing mktime for gmmktime and date for gmdate. But the question is if there is a way to convert the time already in the DB in unix format from local time to gmt time.  Thanksp

Negative 72364 pIm developing remote screencasting application just like VNC but not exactly, where I transfer updated tiles of screen pixels over the network. Id like to implement the caching mechanism, and Id like to hear your recommendations...p  pHere is how I think it should be done. For each tile coordinate, there is fixed size stack cache where I add updated tiles. When saving, I calculate some kind of checksum probably CRC16 would suffice, right of the tile data i.e. pixels. When getting new tile from the new screenshot of desktop, I calculate its checksum and compare to all items checksums in the stack of that tile coordinate. If the checksum matches, instead of sending the tile I send the special message e.g. get tile from cache stack at position X. This means I need to have identical cache stacks on the server and on the client.p  pHere comes my questionsp  ul lipWhat should be the default stack size depth Say if stack size is 5, this means last 5 tiles of specified coordinates will be saved, and 5 times the resolution of screen pixels will be the total cache size. For big screens raw RGB buffer of screen will be approx. 5 megabytes, so having 10level stack means 50MB cache, right So what should be the cache depth I think maybe 10 but need your suggestions.pli lipIm compressing the tiles into JPEG before sending over network. Should I implement caching of JPEG tiles, or raw RBG tiles before compression Logical choice would be caching raw tiles as it would avoid unnecessary JPEG encoding for the tiles that would be found in cache. But saving RGB pixels will require much bigger cache size. So whats the best option  before or after compressionpli lipIs CRC16 checksum alone enough for comparing new screen tiles with the tiles in cache stack I mean should I additionally make bytebybyte comparison for the tiles when CRC matches, or is it redundant Is the collision probability low enough to be discardedpli lipIn general, what do you think about the scheme I described What would you change in it Any kind of suggestions would be appreciatedpli ul

Negative 72364 pI have a stateless, abstract base class from which various concrete classes inherit. Some of these derived classes are stateless as well. Because many of them are created during a run, Id like to save memory and overhead by having all stateless derived classes emulate a singleton, by overriding operator newdelete. A simplified example would look something like thisp  precodeinclude ltmemorygt  struct Base    virtual Base   protected   Base     prevent concrete Base objects   struct D1  public Base    stateful objectdefault behavior   int dummy   struct D2  public Base    stateless objectdont allocate memory   void operator newsizet size        static D2 d2     return ampd2      void operator deletevoid p    int main    Base p1  new D1   Base p2  new D1   Base s1  new D2   Base s2  new D2   delete p1   delete p2   delete s1   delete s2   return 0  codepre  pThis example doesnt work codedelete s2code fails because codedelete s1code called codeBasecode, which deallocated the shared codeBasecode in coded2code. This can be addressed by adding the same trick with newdelete overloading to Base. But Im not sure this is the cleanest solution, or even a correct one valgrind doesnt complain, FWIW. Id appreciate advice or critique.p  pedit actually, the situation is worse. The Base class in this example isnt abstract, as I claimed. If its made abstract, through the addition of a pure virtual method, then I can no longer apply the newdelete overriding trick, because I cannot have a static variable of type Base. So I dont have any solution for this problemp

Negative 72364 pSo Im working on a simple game like app. In it I have an opengles scene with some cube objects. On simulator everything works fine, but on device in this case an ipod touch since thats the only test device I have right now it only renders one frame and then appears to ignore every opengl call i make after that. p  pFor the sake of not killing memory by allocating and deallocating when I start the app I create my gl view in the background and stop its rendering. When the user clicks a button the glview is brought to the front and its render timer is activated. Ive verified that on device it goes through all my render code just as it does on simulator, however it doesnt update at all on device. In the simulator as it updates the cubes move around, but this isnt graphically represented on the device. I can click on the cubes, and the game recognizes it, so their translation matrices are being updated for sure. p  pNow heres the kicker, it used to work. When I first started, every time the user would transition to the gl view, it would alloc a new view controller and run it, and it would update. However, from the second time onward the user transitioned to the view it wouldnt update, with the same symptoms it now shows. To counter this I transitioned the app to using only one gl view, and when the user transitions in I just move the boxes back to their starting positions. I thought this would remove the issue since Im technically always using the first on I allocd. However it shows the symptoms all the time. It does render at least once, because I can see the boxes in their starting positions. Even if I change which texture set Im using though, theyre still in the original texture set though in simulator this works flawlessly.p  pSo, to all the gurus, are there any known issues that would cause openGLes to stop rendering What code would be relevant to show youp

Negative 72364 pI have abandoned my earlier quest to make the applet communicate directly with the database, even though users and webpages have said that its possible. I am now trying to get my applet to pass information String and boolean format entered in textfields or indicated by checkboxes, and give this to the servlet, which then stores it appropriately in the database. Ive got the applet front end  the GUI  built, and the servlet  database connection also built. The only problem is the link between the two, applet and servlet. How would one pass String data from an applet to a servletp  pThanks, Joseph G.p

Negative 72364 pI am working on a Windows forms project that connects to a Microsoft Access database, reads the the file, does some math and then provides some basic statistics back.  Right now I am teaching myself VB and I know the code below could be more efficient.  However, right now I am just trying to make it functional.p  pThe program filters the data it needs via sql, and there are several sql statements.  I separated the code for each of the sql statements and into a subroutine so that I could call each one when the form loads and also when the user clicks a button to update.  The program works fine on the form load, however, when you click the update button you get the following error on the odaCalls.Fill in subroutine Count The select command property has not been initialized before calling Fill.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.

Negative 72364 pIve only been doing objective c for 2 days so if this is a horrible question I apologise. So essentially Im using storyboard to make an iPhone app. On one of my views cells are dynamically created based on retrieving what to display in json format via a http request. When one of these cells is selected a view needs to appear, the same view for each cell not a question about Segues. This view will rely on which of the cells is selected and not only that, but other info from the json that isnt displayed to the user. Hence, I need to pass a NSDictionary to the child view. Im sure this is trivial yet I have found no solution. Thanks in advance for any help.p
Negative 72364 pI am having a problem with an C ASP.NET form.  The purpose of the form is to load some keyvalue pairs from a database to allow a user to view, edit or delete them.p  pThe KeyValue pairs are dynamically generated in the PageLoad event, and everything works well when the page is first openend.  Here is some example code trimmed down from the originalp  precodeTableRow row  new TableRow TableCell cell  new TableCell cell.Text  keyName row.Cells.Addcell cell  new TableCell cell.Text  keyValue row.Cells.Addcell KeyValueTable.Rows.Addrow codepre  pI just loop through all of the KeyValue pairs and each are added dynamically to a table.  At the point of page loading, everything is running smoothly, and all KeyValue pairs show as expected.p  pThe problem occurs when a user clicks a button, which since is set to runatserver, generates a post back event.  What this does is it appears to do is clear the dynamic content generated above, and then recreates it since it is created in the PageLoad event.p  pWhat I would prefer to do is choose when that dynamic content is cleared, since I dont want it refreshing unnecessarily, since each refresh is actually occurring from a database.  p  pWhat I have attempted to do is perform the generation of the dynamic content if it isnt a postback.  I.Ep  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e      if IsPostBack              GenerateDynamicContent       codepre  pHowever what that now does is generate the dynamic content when the page first loads, however as soon as some postback event occurs such as a user clicking a button, the dynamic content is wiped, but not created.p  pBasically what I am hoping for is to discover some way where I can create dynamic content, as shown above, that isnt wiped on any postback event.  I want to be able to control when it is refreshed, rather than it occurring on any postback event.  Is this possiblep  pMany thanksp

So, overall this is a green screen algorithm. p  pI did some benchmarks, and the fps without using this algorithm is 30.0fps. Using this algorithm, it falls down to about 8fps. But, the majority of the for drop comes from codecol[jchannels  0]code If the algorithm doesnt do anything else and use access the array elects, it drops down to about 10fps.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Ok this is interesting, I was removing random lines from the stuff inside the double loop to see what causes the bigger overhead and this is what I found Creating variables on the stack causes  HUGE drop in FPS.

Thought I should update this and let you guys know whats this is the real bottle neck, making variables not he stack.

Negative 72364 pI have a simple regex conversion method that I use to do some minor processing to HTML passed in as a codestdstringcode. The method looks likep  precodestdstring ParseQuotedPrintableHtml stdstring constamp html  codepre  pI want to design this method into some sort of small library that can be used across my whole code base. Since its just a single function, one might be tempted to just create a Utility class or namespace and stuff the function in there. I feel this is a bit of a naive design. Any suggestions on a good rule of thumb as to how to design functionality like this into a centralized and accessible locationp  pEDITp  pI should also mention that there are several helper functions that this function calls I also created these, and they are only useful to and used by this method. Ideally these would be private in a class, but if I keep this as a global function, those implementation methods will also be accessible in the global namespace or whichever namespace I place them in.p  pI guess due to this, its best to create a utility class maybep  precodeclass QuotedPrintableHtml    private     void HelperMethod1 const     void HelperMethod2 const      stdstring html    public     QuotedPrintableHtml stdstring constamp html   htmlhtml      stdstring Parse const  codepre  pPerhaps something like thisp

Negative 72364 pin my app I need to create a bunch of codeUIAlertViewcode popups expecting user to respond to each of them at some moment of time. By definition codeUIAlertViewcode is non modal, i.e. the logic  of my app continues to execute after making them. When the app would go into background would the popups be automatically saved It looks like when user responds by clicking the button, correct popup responds even after app goes into bkgr and comes back.

Negative 72364 pI have a thumbnail gallery and I want to only display X number of images where X fits perfectly into the specific users browser window based off their resolution.p  pThe reason why this is important is because if I do not calculate this based off their resolution, and pull a static number of images, on some resolutions there will be an uneven number on the bottom row. This looks pretty ugly.p  pIs there a way to calculate the correct number of images to display based off resolution I can get the resolution via window.height and window.width if necessary  the thumbs are pulled dynamically so this isnt a problemp  pThe way Im currently doing it is using a huge switch statement with the various resolutions and hardcoded number of image values, and the page loads sends the resolution to the PHP script which passes it into this switch statement, however this is impractical and seems to have unpredictable behavior on different monitors, even monitors with the same resolution. Surely there is a way to calculate this dynamically Or at least a better solution to the seemingly terrible one Im currently using.p  pThanks.p

The app currently hides the status bar and adds 1 view controller to the window.

Negative 72364 pSo you have a DAL in C that using the Repository pattern and you have an interface for each Repository. It is backed by ADO.NET, MS SQL Server, and Stored Procedure calls. p  pThis is great for stubbingmocking out the repository where it is being used else where when doing unit tests, and I Love itp  pHowever, I would love to add some unit testing for the DAL itself. Preferably using Rhino Mocks with NUnit. However I am open to switching to MoQ if a solid case could be made that it can do something that Rhino cant in relation to this question.p  pI would rather not have it talk to any DB during the Unit Tests to keep they more pure while still effectively testing the DAL itself. If however you can not really effectively unit test a DAL itself without it talking to a DB, what would be the alternatives that could be in memory replacements or a portable file based replacements that are compatible with of SQL Server and same SqlConnection and SqlCommand calls.p  pOpen to refactoring the DAL if needed to make it easier to inject as long as it doesnt over complicate the design at the same time. Already using Microsoft Unity, for DI with the Repository Pattern.p
Negative 72364 pI have side by side editor windows as part of my default development perspective in eclipse in Linux, Windows and Mac versions.

Since upgrading I and my colleagues have found that files always open in the left hand side whether or not you are active in the right window or left.p  pDoes anyone have any idea how to restore the old behaviour other than downgrading my eclipse Having had the original behaviour for so long it is quite annoying to have a completely new behaviour to have to get used to.p  pI have tried setting my appearance back to classic with no effect.

Negative 72364 pI am currently working on a little inhouse testing app to create multiple types of load on the computer so that we can see how our software works under load.  I am getting hung up on one request, in that I make some sort of way to specify a percent usage of the CPU say, 40 before the user runs the program, and that will hopefully keep the cpu in a range 10 of what they put in.  Ive been told that they had seen programs doing it before, but every one that I had seen that claimed to do so did not work.  I am attempting to read an average usage and sleep the thread running so that the CPU usage lowers, but I have found that is not accurate.  It is also going to be used on multiple servers, each with different CPUs, so I cant do very much hard coding as it will need to work on each server.  I personally do not think its possible to accurately do, but Im asking here as a last ditch effort to see if anyone else has come across software similar to this, and knows how it would be written.p  pEdit I have attempted to use a lower priority thread, and was also told that would not be useful to them though I had the option created just for the purpose of testing before this was requested of me.p

Negative 72364 pI have a view controller EmbeddedMenuView that uses a custom view HorizontalMenuView.  The Embedded menu view uses multible HorizontalMenuViews.  The HorizontalMenuView contains a UITableView. Each cell in the table view uses quite a bit of memory high quality images..  p  pNow, I need to execute a task every time a section of the table view cells in the HorizontalMenuView is touched.  I did this by creating a protocol in the table view cell and assigning the HorizontalMenuView its delegate.  Then I created a protocol in the HorizontalMenuView and assigned the EmbeddedMenuView its delegate.  So I pass the touch event up to the EmbeddedMenuView.p  pThe problem is, when I assign the cells delegate, the HorizontalMenuView does not get deallocated.  Since this view refreshes itself every time the view appears, the memory footprint gets out of control fast.p  pIf I comment out the part where the cell is assigned a delegate, everything works fine.p  pMy question is How can I properly release a UITableViewCells delegatep  pThis is the code snippet from the HorizontalMenuViewp  precodeUITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath   Custom Logic      HorizontalMenuItemTableViewCell cell  HorizontalMenuItemTableViewCell [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifiercellIdentifier]     if cell  nil           cell  [[[NSClassFromString[[AMPUIManager sharedManager] classNameForNamecellIdentifier] alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifiercellIdentifier] autorelease]          cell.shouldAlwaysTransform  shouldAlwaysTransform         cell.selectionStyle  UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone         cell.colorsDict  colorsDict          if [cell isKindOfClass[ATCustomTableViewCell class]]              ATCustomTableViewCell cell.delegate  self Commenting this out solves my problem.

Negative 72364 pHow are dynamic dns entries discovered by hackers and what tools are they using to glean this informationp  pA few days ago I signed up at noip.org for a free dns entry in order to open up my ecommerce site to a third party that needs to make calls to it in my development environment. Within a day I saw ip addresses coming to my site that are NOT from this third party. Im wondering how this brand new dns entry was discovered and so quickly. At least one of these persons was attempting to hack the site and knew exactly the base product I was working with, an open source ecommerce system, and attempted to gain access to the admin area which has got me curious on how exactly these hackers are able to pull this information so quickly and know exactly the product Im working with.p  pFor now Ive whitelisted the ip addresses from this third party but Id like to use the same logic these hackers are to look at my site from a security standpoint and better protect against it when we go to production.p

Negative 72364 pSo I have a classloader MyClassLoader that maintains a set of special classes in memory. These special classes are dynamically compiled and stored in a byte array inside MyClassLoader. When the MyClassLoader is asked for a class, it first checks if its codespecialClassescode dictionary contains it, before delegating to the System classloader. It looks something like thisp  precodeclass MyClassLoader extends ClassLoader      MapltString, byte[]gt specialClasses      public MyClassLoaderMapltString, byte[]gt sb          this.specialClasses  sb           Override     public Classltgt loadClassString name throws ClassNotFoundException          if specialClasses.containsKeyname return findClassname         else return super.loadClassname           Override     public Class findClassString name          byte[] b  specialClasses.getname         return defineClassname, b, 0, b.length           codepre  pIf I want to perform transformations e.g. instrumentation on the codespecialClassescode, I can do so simply by modifying the codebyte[]code before i call codedefineClasscode on it. p  pI would also like to transform the classes which are provided by the System classloader, but the System classloader doesnt seem to provide any way of accessing the raw codebyte[]code of the classes it provides, and gives me the codeClasscode objects directly. p  pI could use a codejavaagentcode instrument all classes loaded into the JVM, but that would add overhead to the classes which I do not want to instrument I only really want the classes loaded by MyClassLoader to be instrumented.p  ul liIs there any way of retrieving the raw codebyte[]code of the classes provided by the parent classloader, so I can instrument them before defining my own copy li liAlternately, is there any way of emulating the functionality of the System classloader, in terms of where it grabs its codebyte[]codes from, so that MyClassLoader can instrument and define its own copy of all the System classes Object, String, etc.li ul  pEDITp  pSo I tried another approachp  ul liUsing a codejavaagentcode, Capture the codebyte[]code of every class that is loaded and store it in a hashtable, keyed by the name of the class.li liMyClassLoader, instead of delegating the system classes to its parent classloader, would instead load their bytecode from this hashtable using the class name and define itli ul  pIn theory this would let MyClassLoader define its own version of the system classes with instrumentation. However, it fails with ap  precodejava.lang.SecurityException Prohibited package name java.lang codepre  pClearly the JVM does not like me defining the codejava.langcode classes myself, even though it should in theory be from the same codebyte[]code source that the bootstraploaded classes should come from. The search for a solution continues.p  pEDIT2p  pI found a really sketchy solution for this problem, but if someone who knows more than me about the intricacies of the Java classloadinginstrumentation can come up with something less sketchy, that would be awesome.p

Negative 72364 pOkay. Im at wits end and havent found a posting that addresses my problem completely. Im new to C and Im unfamiliar with databases.

Negative 72364 pI am developing a video app in which user can merge different videos present in Asset Library. I am able to join the videos but I am facing the orientation issues. For example, if a video is landscape right and other is landscape left, the second video will be joined upside down. Moreover, I have tried different codes available at stackExchange, however if i apply those codes to portrait videos, they can be transformed to landscape right but leaving black margins on the sides. p  pIs there any way that when I select a video to be inserted in my project, first its orientation should be checked, if it is other then landscape right, it should be rotated accordingly and in the end if the original video was portrait, the  video should be resized as the native player do when we play a video in full screen mode.p  pThanks in advance.p

Adding graphComponent to existing JScrollPane also doesnt work. Does anyone have any ideasp

Negative 72364 pI always thought that replacing an expression codex  code with code  code would be one of the most basic optimizations during compiling Haskell programs. Since codecode has a single inhabitant, no matter what codexcode is, its result is codecode. This optimization seemed to me as a significant consequence of referential transparency. And we could do such an optimization for any type with just a single inhabitant.p  pemUpdateem My reasoning in this matter comes from natural deduction rules. There the unit type corresponds to truth  and we have an expansion rule if codex  code then code  code. For example see a hrefhttpwww.cs.cmu.edufpcoursesatphandoutsch2natded.pdf relnofollowthis texta p. 20. I assumed that its safe to replace an expression with its expansion or contractum.p  pOne consequence of this optimization would be that codeundefined  code would be replaced by code  code, but I dont see this as a problem  it would simply make programs a bit lazier and relying on codeundefined  code is certainly a bad programming practice.p  pHowever today I realized that such optimization would break codeControl.Seqcode completely. codeStrategycode is defined asp  precodetype Strategy a  a gt  codepre  pand we havep  precode  rseq evaluates its argument to weak head normal form. rseq  Strategy a rseq x  x seq  codepre  pBut coderseq x  code so the optimization would simply discard the required evaluation of codexcode to WHNF.p  pSo where is the problemp  ul liDoes the existence of coderseqcode and codeseqcode break referential transparency even if we consider only terminating expressionsli liOr is this a flaw of the design of codeStrategycode and we could devise a better way how to force expressions to WHNF compatible with such optimizationsli ul

I can produce the same errors if I use this little client to connect to port 443 of the above two servers. I am 99 certain this is a bug with QT since we have produced this issue on many development systems. It affects linux, mac and windows QT. It affects QT 4.7.4 all the way to QT 4.8.4 didnt try earlier versions. The bug is reproduced with openssl 0.9.8. p  pSome people might falsely claim that the bug is fixed by using openssl 1.0.0 with precompiled QT binary. Thats wrong since the precompiled QT binary is compiled with openssl 0.9.8 header files. Openssl 0.9.8 is not binary compatible with openssl 1.0.0. Some of the structure memebers will be misinterpreted if you compile QT with one version of openssl but use another version of openssl binary. I did a lot of stepandtrace into QT and openssl source code to arrive at this conclusion. p  pSince hotmail and yahoo email are extremely popular websites, Id consider this bug is a serious bug in terms of security for QT. I already reported it to QT bug system httpsbugreports.qtproject.orgbrowseQTBUG23625 and I doubt when digia will ever get their hands on it based on my past experience. p  pPlease feel free to share your thoughts on how to fix this bug.

makes it look more like an openssl bug. We also notice that the hotmail server only returns the server certificate but does not return the intermediate certificate. Thats probably what caused the error. I tried the same ssl command with other https servers. They also return both server certificates and intermediate certificates. Some of the banking sites Ive tested even returned the entire certificate chain all the way to the root CA. So, the question is, if the intermediate certificate is not returned, how and where am I supposed to get it from How does other browsers like IE and chrome handle this p  hr  pstrongMore findings here.strongp  pActually, both of the two servers I mentioned are used to download inpage components for hotmail and yahoo mail. The yahoo mail main login page itself does return the full certificate chain. When other browsers access the main page, it will store the intermediate certificates locally for later use. However, QTWebkit doesnt cache the intermediate certificates automatically, therefore causing the problem. If I access the server a hrefhttpsgfx8.hotmail.com relnofollowhttpsgfx8.hotmail.coma directly with a fresh copy of firefox, I get the same error. But if I access httpswww.hotmail.com first and then log into hotmail, there is no error although some components are downloaded from the gfx8 server after login. I found QTWebkit neither loads the intermediate certificates from system certificate store, nor does it add intermediate certificates to the system certificate store. It doesnt cache intermediate certificates internally in memory either. That will cause problem for some servers which doesnt return the complete certificate chain. p  pI did try saving the intermediate certificates to PEM file and load it at startup of my application. It works fine on Windows and Linux. But somehow, it has no effect on Mac. Dont know why.  p

Negative 72364 pI first want to mention that the following worked fine up to Qt 5.0.0 beta 1 maybe beta 2 and RC too, dont know, but fails in Qt 5.0.0 final release version. I only want to refer to the results seen in Qt 5.0.0 final release version. So most probably this has something to do with recent changes in Qt5.p  pOn C side I have a set of classes QObjectderived in a namespace which is optionally triggered with compiler flags the classes are in a separate library and the library leaves the usage of a namespace as an option to the user of the library. A class, here codeGamecode, might look like this excerptp  precodeOAEBEGINNAMESPACE   forwarddeclarations class Player     Player is just another class in the same library  class Game  public QObject      QOBJECT  public     explicit Game...  public slots     Player player const   lt the quesion is about such slots   OAEENDNAMESPACE codepre  pThe macros codeOAEBEGINENDNAMESPACEcode expand to either codenamespace OAENAMESPACE code ... codecode or nothing, in the same way Qt does it in codeltqglobal.hgtcode, just QT replaced with OAE in the macro namesp  precodeifndef OAENAMESPACE   define OAEPREPENDNAMESPACEname name  define OAEUSENAMESPACE  define OAEBEGINNAMESPACE  define OAEENDNAMESPACE  define OAEBEGININCLUDENAMESPACE  define OAEENDINCLUDENAMESPACE  define OAEBEGINMOCNAMESPACE  define OAEENDMOCNAMESPACE  define OAEFORWARDDECLARECLASSname class name  define OAEFORWARDDECLARESTRUCTname struct name  define OAEMANGLENAMESPACEname name  else  user namespace    define OAEPREPENDNAMESPACEname OAENAMESPACEname  define OAEUSENAMESPACE using namespace OAENAMESPACE  define OAEBEGINNAMESPACE namespace OAENAMESPACE   define OAEENDNAMESPACE   define OAEBEGININCLUDENAMESPACE   define OAEENDINCLUDENAMESPACE namespace OAENAMESPACE   define OAEBEGINMOCNAMESPACE OAEUSENAMESPACE  define OAEENDMOCNAMESPACE  define OAEFORWARDDECLARECLASSname      OAEBEGINNAMESPACE class name OAEENDNAMESPACE      using OAEPREPENDNAMESPACEname   define OAEFORWARDDECLARESTRUCTname      OAEBEGINNAMESPACE struct name OAEENDNAMESPACE      using OAEPREPENDNAMESPACEname   define OAEMANGLENAMESPACE0x x  define OAEMANGLENAMESPACE1a, b ab  define OAEMANGLENAMESPACE2a, b OAEMANGLENAMESPACE1a,b  define OAEMANGLENAMESPACEname OAEMANGLENAMESPACE2          OAEMANGLENAMESPACE0name, OAEMANGLENAMESPACE0OAENAMESPACE  namespace OAENAMESPACE    ifndef OAEBOOTSTRAPPED  ifndef OAENOUSINGNAMESPACE         This expands to a using OAENAMESPACE also in header files.     It is the only way the feature can be used without too much     pain, but if people really do not want it they can add     DEFINES  OAENOUSINGNAMESPACE to their .pro files.         OAEUSENAMESPACE  endif  endif  endif  user namespace  codepre  pIn the following, when saying enabling the namespace, I mean I declared the macro codeOAENAMESPACEcode, in this case with the value codeoaecode.p  pAmong others, I access instances of this class and the codePlayercode class as returned by codeplayercode from within QML for the user interface of my application. For this, I register the classes as followsp  precodeqmlRegisterTypeltGamegt qmlRegisterTypeltPlayergt codepre  pI provide the QML frontend a pointer to an instance of a codeGamecode, called codetheGamecode within QMLp  precodeview.enginegtrootContextgtsetContextPropertytheGame,         QVariantfromValueltGamegtgame codepre  pWithin QML, I use this as usual. A small example should print a pointer address of the codeplayercodep  precodeRectangle      width 100 height 100     Component.onCompleted console.logtheGame.player  codepre  pI get the following results, depending on whether I set a codeOAENAMESPACEcode or not by the way I use the same setting for both the library and the application using itp  ul lipWhen strongdisabling the namespacestrong, everything works as expected and QML prints me the pointerp  precodePlayer0x10b4ae0 codepreli lipWhen strongenabling the namespacestrong and codeusingcode it in the C code using the library, so I dont change the code at all, QML fails to understand the return type of codeGameplayercodep  precodeError Unknown method return type Player codepreli lipWhen strongchanging the return typestrong of codeGameplayercode to codeoaePlayercode, everything works fine againp  precodeoaePlayer0x10b4ae0 codepreli ul  pMy conclusion so far is that codemoccode doesnt consider the namespace I put around the class. My first guess was Hey, codemoccode doesnt know that I define the namespace when calling codegcode, which is what I do in the .pro file p  precodeDEFINES  OAENAMESPACEoae codepre  pHowever, when changing the return type to codeOAENAMESPACEPlayercode, it still works, so moc emdoesem know of the codeOAENAMESPACEcode macro, but it doesnt either expand the codeOAEBEGINENDNAMESPACEcode macros or it doesnt parse namespaces at all anymore.p  pcodemoccode produces the following stringdata for codePlayer  Gameplayer constcode which containes the methods return typep  ul lipWhen strongdisabling the namespacestrong and using the return type codePlayercodep  precodeplayer0Player0 codepreli lipWhen strongenabling the namespacestrong and using the return type codePlayercodep  precodeplayer0Player0 codepreli lipWhen strongenabling the namespacestrong and using the return type codeOAENAMESPACEPlayercodep  precodeplayer0oaePlayer0 codepreli ul  pOn the other side, codemoccode prepends class names as returned by codeQMetaObjectclassNamecode with the namespace if enabled.p  pMy conclusion now is that I emcouldem fix this by writing codeOAENAMESPACEClassNamecode instead of codeClassNamecode whenever using these types in the signatures of QObject meta methods. Well, there is the better macro codeOAEPREPENDNAMESPACEcode. Since this would look horrible in the code, and to me it even seems wrong because the method emalready is in the namespaceem, strongis there a better solutionstrongp  pNow there also is codeOAEBEGINENDMOCNAMESPACEcode analogous to codeQTBEGINENDMOCNAMESPACEcode, strongemso maybe I need those anywhereemstrong I dont know wherehow they are used in Qt, so I should use them accordingly in my library, since I want to use the same optional namespace feature as Qt does.p

Negative 72364 pIve been developing a lot in Java lately but Ive been asked to look at switching one of my projects to C and Im having a bit of trouble setting up the includes.  Unfortunately the extent of my C knowledge is a couple of academic projects I did in college.p  pI have created a project in NetBeans and Im trying to add in some headers from an external library pugixml.  I have p  precodeinclude pugixml.hpp codepre  pat the top of the file I intend to use it in.  The problem is that when I compile I get p  precodemain.cpp923 pugixml.hpp No such file or directory codepre  pwhich seems odd to me seeing as the IDE definitely knows where the file is.  Code completion on classes from inside the library works and holding control and mousing over the file name shows me the correct directory where the file lives.  How do I convince the compiler to include this directoryp  pI know this really feels like something that should be easy to Google, but I havent had any luck.p

Negative 72364 pI followed some examples for making an codeNSButtoncode subclass work as an codeNSColorWellcode since our codeNSButtoncode subclass already gives us the appearance behavior we need, however Ive noticed that after using the button to invoke the panel and changing the color, its also changing the color of selected text in our document. If I instead subclassed codeNSColorWellcode with our appearance customizations, would it not have this problemp  pHowever, Im still hoping for a workaround that avoids that amp still lets us use our button subclass. Ive seen discussion threads suggest letting the button itself become the first responder, however with the button being in a separate palette Im having trouble getting this to work. Also Id prefer not to alter the responder chain or have the palette become the key window.

Negative 72364 pI would like to convert unsigned int to uint64 inside C function. uint64 is defined in R package int64.p  pEDITp  pThis question is about conversion from C unsigned int data type to uint64 R language data type. p  pint64 package has been developped so that 64 bit integer vectors are represented using only R data structures, i.e data is not represented as external pointers to some C object. Instead, each 64 bit integer is represented as a couple of regular 32 bit integers, each of them carrying half the bits of the underlying 64 bit integer. This was a choice by design so that 64 bit integer vectors can be serialized and used as data frame columns.p

Negative 72364 pIm filling a database with entries that should be replaced if they are already present. To do this, first I check if the entry is already present with a find which is wrapped in a read only transaction, then if the returned value is null, I persist the newly made entry wrapped in a transaction, if the returned value is an existing entry, I first remove it wrapped in a transaction and then add the new entry. Besides the fact that these are a lot of transactions that could be done inside a single transaction, Im wondering why I get an exception if an entry is already present.

Negative 72364 pI use history management in my ajaxwebapplicationGWT. When the user presses the backward or forward button, another view will be displayed. Every view will be only created once. My quesion is how can i handle the presenter. br br I think there are two waysbr 1. The view saves all data and after every history change event, a new presenter will be created. When the model needs some data, the presenter will ask the view for data and send them to the model.brbr 2. The presenter saves all data and after every history change event, the presenter will be reused for the view. Thus the view has only the ui widgets and all changes made by the user will be redirected to the presenter.  brbrp  pI prefer the second way, but i am not sure if that is compatible to mvp. What do you recommend mep

Negative 72364 pSave dialog opens and asks me to save one of my classes when I try to debug my program, if close the dialog nothing happens, if I press save it will say Access to emfilepath to classem is denied and it wont debug. If I simply remove the class that causes the problem and copy paste its code into a new class with the same name it works for some time but as soon as I add significantly more code to that class the same problem occurs, I am clueless of what to do about it, thankful for any ideas. Probably worth mentioning is that its a team project, using teamfoundation source controll, might have something to do with that but not sure.p

Negative 72364 pI need to move my code from a COpenGL and Config.txt situation to a UI friendly space. I was told here to try Qt and installed it in Windows.p  pThe issue I ran into is that it did not support the OpenGL version I needed out of the box and I had to rebuild with the opengl desktop parameter.p  pFirst time doing this, but was able to follow the instructions  and a ton of Google and it succesfully was built. My issue now is I am unsure how to make the files I have work with Qt Creator.p  pI copied over all the folders from the qt5 folder created by git over to the Src folder in Qt5.0.15.0.1Src but the hellogl example still wouldnt build.p  pI checked the options and it was pointing to a qmake in Qt5.0.15.0.1msvc2010bin so I copied over the qmake.exe from qtbaseqmake over to this folder renaming the old one and now Qt Creator builds the hellogl example on my Windows system.p  pMy worry is, did I do this the right way I fumbled around and got emsomethingem, but is this the way I should have proceeded after I built the qt5 from git If not what was the way I should have gone about making it all work with the Qt Creatorp

Negative 72364 pIve got this here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netmCPvp2 relnofollowfiddlea, and its pretty close to what I want, but theres a couple of problems. First off, the top portion of the inner menu disappears once the menu reaches its full height. Secondly, if you mouse in and out of the menu while its transitioning, it just kind of... stops. What Id like is for when you get back into it, it just expands back out for the duration of your mouse being in there, and resumes collapsing once your mouse exits.p  pIf I get rid of the .stop, then it does a dancing thing, rather than what I mentioned I want.p  pEdit The top portion missing was fixed by adding some padding to pillarsbody any at all, even if it doesnt impact the view, fixes it. Strange. However, the menu still just stops when I reenter as its collapsing. p  pFurther edit Fixed the menu just stopping by switching to slideToggle instead of slideUp and slideDown.p  pHeres the htmlp  precodeltdiv idmissionstatementcontainergt ltdiv classpillarsgt     ltdiv classpillarsbodygt         ltdivgtltspan classpillarindicatorgtltspangtltspan classpillartextgtFirst Pillarltspangt         ltdivgt         ltdivgtltspan classpillarindicatorgtltspangtltspan classpillartextgtSecond Pillarltspangt         ltdivgt         ltdivgtltspan classpillarindicatorgtltspangtltspan classpillartextgtThird Pillarltspangt         ltdivgt         ltdivgtltspan classpillarindicatorgtltspangtltspan classpillartextgtFourth Pillarltspangt         ltdivgt         ltdivgtltspan classpillarindicatorgtltspangtltspan classpillartextgtFith Pillarltspangt         ltdivgt         ltdivgtltspan classpillarindicatorgtltspangtltspan classpillartextgtSixth Pillarltspangt         ltdivgt         ltdivgtltspan classpillarindicatorgtltspangtltspan classpillartextgtSeventh Pillarltspangt         ltdivgt         ltdivgtltspan classpillarindicatorgtltspangtltspan classpillartextgtEighth Pillarltspangt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classpillarsdemogtPILLARSltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pp  pAnd the javascriptp  precode.pillarsbody.hide .pillars.hoverfunction       .pillarsbody.stop.slideDown , function       .pillarsbody.stop.slideUp  codepre  pAnd the CSS for good measurep  precode.pillarindicator      display inlineblock     height 15px     width 15px     marginleft 20px     marginright 15px     background yellow      .pillarsbody      background black     color white  .pillarsbody div      margintop 10px  .pillars      position absolute     top 0     left 0  .pillarsdemo      float left  codepre  pFurther note I just noticed that if you move the mouse out of the menu while its expanding, and then come back to it after it collapses and make it expand again, then it doesnt hide the top portion once it fully expands, if that means anything.p

Negative 72364 pIm making a custom segue that fades to black, swaps out the view controller and then fades back to transparent.  Unfortunately, I cant seem to get it to do that.  Heres the codep  precode voidperform       UIView overlay  [[UIView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0, 0, [self.sourceViewController navigationController].view.frame.size.width, [self.sourceViewController navigationController].view.frame.size.height]     [overlay setBackgroundColor[UIColor colorWithRed0 green0 blue0 alpha0.0]]     [[self.sourceViewController navigationController].view addSubviewoverlay]      [UIView animateWithDuration2.0 delay0.0 optionsUIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseIn animations       [overlay setAlpha1.0]     completionBOOL finished        [[self.sourceViewController navigationController] pushViewController[self destinationViewController] animatedNO]       [UIView animateWithDuration2.0 delay0.0 optionsUIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseIn animations         [overlay setAlpha0.0]       completionBOOL finished          [overlay removeFromSuperview]         NSLogDone       ]     ]   codepre  pSo, what Ive done is add a UIView to the navigation controller that has a black background and an alpha of 0.  Then, I do an animation to change the alpha to 1, push the destination view controller onto the navigation controller, and then animate back to clear.  When I do this, nothing happens.  It just drops the destination view controller onto the navigation controller without any kind of animation.  p  pOddly, if I start with an alpha of 1 and animate to 0 and then back to 1, it works but it isnt what I want. p  pIm thinking that theres some optimization happening that excludes my clear UIView and so changing the transparency is meaningless. p
Negative 72364 pIn my UI i have  2 text field and and 2 buttons .I am using jface data binding to bind the text field and i am doing the validation  and depending on the validation success  the model is updated other wise it will not.I want my button to respond accordingly .Like if my model is not updated than i want to disable my button.One more  thing that i do anot want to do hard coding .so is there any way to that without hard coding.p  pIn other way I want to bind a button to text field so that when the text field has some unwanted value than the button should be disabled .In the other way i am doing data binding on text field  which will take care when the text field does not have proper value than it will not update its model.Then i want to disable the button when the value is not proper can i do that.Any pointer on this helps me a lot.p

Negative 72364 pForgive my noobness coding as I teach myself PHP lol p The code below works almost perfectly for a form I want to create. Whenever the user hits the submit button, provided the form is all filled in correctly, the text Email Sent Successfully message appears at the top of the page. If any of the mandatory fields are incomplete or invalid, then an error message is returned underneath the corresponding input field and the email sent successfully message does not appear. This works properly for all but the last if statement antispam. Essentially, if you enter the correct answer 3 into the antispam box, then regardless of the other fields being filled in or not, the email Sent Successfully message appears it shouldnt do this as other fields are not filled out correctly. The email Sent Successfully message should only appear if all the mandatory fields are completed correctly.P Whatever if statement goes at the bottom adheres to the same rule i.e. if name was at the bottom of the if statements, then only name would need to be entered correctly for the email sent successfully message to appear. It feels as though if the last if statement is passed as true, the other statements dont work.p  precodeltphp  if issetPOST[submit]  yourname  POST[yourname] organisation  POST[organisation] emailfrom  POST[email] comments  POST[comments] antispam  POST[antispam] namestring  [AZaz .] emailstring  [AZaz09.][AZaz09.].[AZaz]2,4 errormessageemail   errormessagename   errormessagemessage   errormessageantispam    ifpregmatchnamestring,yourname    errormessagename .

Negative 72364 pWhile developing an OpenCL kernel supposed to compute some features on an image, I came across a bug I didnt manage to solve.

Moreover only the red channels contain value different from 0. These values go from 0 to 35 with the left upper corner pixel having the red value set to 0, its right neighbor to 1 and so on, until the right lower corner pixel with the red value to 35.

Negative 72364 pI am building a Cake PHP application.

Negative 72364 pDoes anybody know what the CommandTarget property on a MenuItem can be used for a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.input.icommandsource.commandtarget.aspx relnofollowThe documentation says the followingap  blockquote   pWhen used with a RoutedCommand, the command target is the object on   which the Executed and CanExecute events are raised. If the   CommandTarget property is not set, the element with keyboard focus   will be used as the target.p blockquote  pHowever, at runtime, the value of CommandTarget is nowhere to be seen in the Execute handler for the command. sender is the window the CommandBinding belongs to. ExecutedRoutedEventArgs is full of references to distant ancestors of the menu item. p  pThe goal here is to implement a command which is executed from a variety of different context menus on a variety of different grids, lists, whatever  they all contain items which support a particular interface. Their context menus differ, but have some commands in common. The common commands use the same Executed and CanExecute handlers regardless of what you click on, because the Foo command does Foo. The handlers figure out what the selected item is for whatever gridlist you clicked on, try to cast it to an interface, and do something with it if its got that interface if the interface consumed by a given command isnt supported by the item, that command is disabled. If I get the ContextMenu or MenuItem as sender, I can get the PlacementTarget and I know what the user clicked on, but that only works if I define the CommandBinding in the XAML definition of the ContextMenu  which means copynpasting that whole block of XAML in every ContextMenu where the command is used, and redefining the handlers in every one of those view classes. Thats not a mess I want to maintain. p  pIt seems like this is a case where theres no languageindependent reason to write those handlers more than once, or associate each one with a given command more than once. But as far as I can tell, it appears that XAML wants you to bind the handlers and the target all together. Can you bind the handlers once and then sneak in a different target p  pUPDATE I resolved this by putting the commands in a static Command class, the handlers in a nonstatic class the main view, not that it matters, and writing a static Command.GetCommandBindingcommand method which instantiates and returns a CommandBinding for the command you pass in. So if I want to use command Foo on grid Bar, in the constructor for the view where Bar lives I just call thisp  precodeBar.CommandBindings.AddCommands.GetCommandBindingCommands.Foo codepre  pBar is then passed as the sender for the Executed and CanExecute events on the command when it is assigned to the Command property of a MenuItem belonging to Bars ContextMenu. p  pCant do the binding in XAML because the handlers have to be members of the View class. It seems odd that the designers put this much work into helping us reuse the NAMES of commands while making it so painful to reuse the actual, like CODE for the command, but whatever. Its not the dumbest thing Microsoft ever did, and most of the rest of XAML is pretty great IMHO. p  pAnother solution Define menu items as resources independently of context menus, and reuse the whole menu items. This is in Resources.xaml, which I can include in other XAML files as a merged dictionary. The event handlers are in Resources.cs. Consumers can use GridContextMenu, or insert CtxMenuItemEmailDocument into their own context menus the same way. p  precodeltMenuItem CommandxStatic vwCommands.EmailDocument          xKeyCtxMenuItemEmailDocumentgt     ltMenuItem.CommandBindingsgt         ltCommandBinding CommandxStatic vwCommands.EmailDocument                         ExecutedEmailDocumentExecuted                         CanExecuteEmailDocumentCanExecute                         gt     ltMenuItem.CommandBindingsgt ltMenuItemgt  ltContextMenu xKeyGridContextMenu xSharedtruegt     lt other items gt     ltStaticResource ResourceKeyCtxMenuItemEmailDocument gt     lt other items gt ltContextMenugt codepre  pCommandTarget seems to exhibit completely different behavior on a Button. Either that, or CommandBindings behave completely differently if theyre defined in separate file, or as a resource, or... whatever. p

Negative 72364 pIm having problems using a variable as the selector for a paragraph on which I want to take action. Specifically I have several title elements and the same number of paragraphs. The desired result is that if I click on Title1 then I take an action on paragraph1. I made a simple case for development purposes whereby if I click on a title then the text of the corresponding paragraph changes color. If I hard code the solution it works but passing in a variable as the selector fails.p  pThe jQuery is as followsp  precode    jQuerydocument.readyfunction        this.clickfunction          var targetevent.target.id Get the id of the title on which we clicked. We will extract the number from this and use it to create a new id for the section we want to open.         alerttarget checking that we are getting the right value.         var openaddresstarget.replaceclickgi, sectioncreate the new id for the section we want to open.         alertopenaddressConfirm that the correct ID has been created         openaddress.css color, green get the id of the click element and set it as a variable.         section1.css color, green Test to confirm that hard coded selector functions correctly.              return false Suppress the action on the anchor link.                     codepre  pThe alert returns the following variable img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comw3iYP.png altalert returned showing the value of the variable which appears to be correct and matches the hard coded version.

Negative 72364 pSo lets say I have created two windows via the Ti.UI.createWindow method,and I have a close window button on both windows. The first window is the current window. p  pI click the second windows close button and instead of closing the second window, it takes focus. I have to click the second windows close button again once it is active to close the window. p  pIs there any way of being able to click the button even if the window does not have focus or somehow pass the click event through so it not only takes focus but also inherits the click event for the button Thanks.p

Session 1 creates for example, 99 and the other 65. My question is why am i not notified of dropped transactions  I read something about a NOWAIT clause.

Negative 72364 pWe have built a REST API.  The API is built, and working, and uses basic authentication for every request.p  pWe now wish to build other web applications that use the REST API.  Were having issues working out how to do authentication in the web app, however.p  pIdeally, we want the web application to display a login page, and the user will enter in their credentials for the REST API.  The problem is that once the user is logged in to the web application, how and where does the web application store the entered credentials, bearing in mind that it strongwill need to store themstrong in order to submit the credentials to the REST API when it needs to make any further request.p  pModern web browsers must do something similar, no  When we access the REST API in the browser, it asks us for the username and password once, but subsequent requests resubmit the credentials we entered earlier.

If a control is disabled, I change the Visibility to Collapsed and set its row height in the grid to zero.  This works great on application start up.p  pThe issue is that if the user goes into the settings screen and reenables controls that were previously hidden while the application is already running, Im not sure how to set the controls grid column back to the correct size, and make it redistribute all the available height among the new increased number of rows.p  pIs there a way to set all the heights back to  in C code, and have WPF do the redistributionp  pIf not, any other ideas, other than doing the math myself and manually setting the row heights, or restarting the whole applicationp

Very often you just want to forward the global variable to the function thats why I usually give them equal names. Also I guess its always safer to avoid the below function call, without specificationsp  pThanks.p

Negative 72364 pI am building an application that uses both GeoNames and Google Places API. The thing is, when I do a search nearby by a specific location say lat 47.16, lng 27.56 on both of the services I do not know how to remove entities that appear both in the results from Google Places and the results from GeoNamesfindNearby. I was thinking about using location latitude and longitude but it isnt accurate enough. Also, the name varies considerably so this wouldnt work either. Another idea that crossed my mind would be using the types feature codes for GeoNames and type for Google Places, but there are a lot of types and obviously I can not do a cross reference manually.

Negative 72364 pI come from a heavy .NETIIS background and although I have worked with Java in the past, I am fairly new to large Java web applications so please bear with me. Due to my limited background, I will walk through the steps I took from the very start trying to get this app to deploy in case my fix for another issue could have broken something else.p  pI am having trouble deploying a SpringHibernate application to the WildFly application server. The application itself definitely works because it is a sample project in an opensource eCommerce framework Broadleaf Commerce. I have also successfully got it to run on Jetty locally.p  pThe application uses three JNDI data sources which I have configured in WildFlyJBoss I have confirmed that the application sees them because I tried running it prior to configuring the DSs and it gave a clear error, which it no longer did after I configured them.p  pAfterwards, the application would throw three different errors one per each PU saying that it was unable to start the persistence units due to a class loading exception. This error I was able to fix by adding a jbossdeploymentstructure.xml file into WEBINF with the following contents based on what I understand, this file is needed because this app has all of the Hibernate JARs within its WAR file already, and thus the below file tells JBoss not to supply its own Hibernate implementationp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltjbossdeploymentstructuregt     ltdeploymentgt         ltexclusionsgt            ltmodule nameorg.hibernategt            ltmodule nameorg.javassistgt            ltmodule nameorg.apache.log4j gt         ltexclusionsgt         ltdependenciesgt             ltmodule nameorg.jboss.ironjacamar.jdbcadapters slotmaingt         ltdependenciesgt     ltdeploymentgt ltjbossdeploymentstructuregt codepre  pAfter adding the above file, I now get this set of three one per each PU errorsp  precode231516,791 INFO  [org.jboss.as.controller] DeploymentScannerthreads  2 JBAS014774 Service status report JBAS014777   Services which failed to start      service jboss.persistenceunit.admin.warblPU.FIRSTPHASE org.jboss.msc.service.StartException in service jboss.persistenceunit.admin.warblPU.FIRSTPHASE java.util.ServiceConfigurationError org.hibernate.integrator.spi.Integrator Provider org.hibernate.envers.event.EnversIntegrator not a subtype       service jboss.persistenceunit.admin.warblSecurePU.FIRSTPHASE org.jboss.msc.service.StartException in service jboss.persistenceunit.admin.warblSecurePU.FIRSTPHASE java.util.ServiceConfigurationError org.hibernate.integrator.spi.Integrator Provider org.hibernate.envers.event.EnversIntegrator not a subtype       service jboss.persistenceunit.admin.warblCMSStorage.FIRSTPHASE org.jboss.msc.service.StartException in service jboss.persistenceunit.admin.warblCMSStorage.FIRSTPHASE java.util.ServiceConfigurationError org.hibernate.integrator.spi.Integrator Provider org.hibernate.envers.event.EnversIntegrator not a subtype codepre  pThere is a file called hibernateenvers4.1.11.Final.jar inside the WAR archive. Also remember that this is the same WAR except the jbossdeploymentstructure.xml file which ran successfully on Jetty.p  pI tried poking around but simply have no idea where to look... I tried changing the DSs in WildFly to use a JDBC4based driver as well as a JDBC41 probably has nothing to do with it with no luck. I know it is probably something very simple and is related to configuration of either WildFly or the application itself, but I am not sure where to poke around.p  pMy completely out of the blue take on it is that WildFly is still somehow trying to load an older version of Hibernate, which the classes in the bundled 4.1.11 Envers JAR are trying to override but cannot or vice versa.p  pIf it is of any use  the app is trying to connect to a PostgreSQL 9.3 database and the DSs defined in WildFly work as far as clicking Test Connection goes.p  pIf there is any other info I can provide which would be helpful, please let me know.p  pAny insights or hints would be very much appreciated.p

Including a random factor might help, but what I would like to do is to use neural network to find optimum settings for my tuning variables.p  pI found some research papers that talk about this kind of thing, but could not find any real implementations. Has anybody done it Any recommendations on how to proceed I have not worked with neural networks, but have done mathematical programming optimization in university and normal optimization methods will take too long to solve this problem.p

Negative 72364 pEntity Framework doesnt allow emsharing the same entity between multiple database contexts.em Therefore, I have to use only emone database context in a GUI applicationem be it WPF or WinForms, because entities need to interact with each other.p  pSQL Server Compact doesnt allow emsharing the same database connection between multiple threadsem. If I try creating a connection on one thread and running SQL query on another, my application is likely to crash.p  pTherefore, I have to emcreate EF database context on one thread and run all queries on that threadem.

Negative 72364 pI need to create a proxy for an application my team is working on that we can use to intercept requests to certain domains and return specific content mostly mocked content, sometimes debugging information included, etc... if certain conditions within the request are met e.g., certain auth headers, remote address range, etc.... p  pFor requests that do not need to be diverted to our development environment, I want them be sent to the original intended target. How I started implementing this initially was to use a ProxyService that would take a HttpServletRequest and using Apache HttpClient 4.3,  submit the request and return the response as a string to be evaluated we sometimes modify the content to make debugging easier. p  pI am running into a number of issues where the request URI is littered with invalid characters. At first I tried using URL to reconstruct the URI with things like URLEncoder.encode for each fragment of the URI path, file, query string values, etc... but I quick was hit with another issue. p  pSome of the origin servers for these requests do not check if the URL is encoded and end up failing when they are. p  pe.g., p  precodehttpwww.example.comfile.phpx1y2,z3 httpswww.example.comsomepathfoo[x1] httpswww.example.comsomepathx1y2stufffoobarbazhere codepre  pI have tried breaking the path into fragments and encoding each fragment and appending them to a string builder to recreate the URI but then I discovered that some of the services choke when they receive an encoded URL. p  pIm relatively green when it comes to handling problems like this with Java, and Im not sure where I should be looking for a solution. p  pDetails about the applicationp  pSpring Boot app using Spring 4 MVC Embedded Tomcat 8 servletp  pWhat would be ideal is if there was some way I could just take the HttpServletRequest object, and transparently proxy that to the original host with minimal changes, this way the headers, content, parameters, etc... were all preserved, but I would still be able to access the response content to modify for development. p  pWhat I really want to try and avoid is having to write and maintain a service class that handles normalizing and sanitizing these URIs myself. p

Negative 72364 pSay I have 2 animation buttons on a page. A user clicks on the first animation and it animates into place. I have it so the animation opens up and it stays there until the user clicks on somewhere else on the page.

Negative 72364 pI am new to Simulink and I am having some problems on building and running multibody models. p  pShortly, here is my problem. I have designed a 2 joint,2 body system. I actuate each joint with position, velocity and acceleration data array format and the system works perfectly. I connected joint sensors to each joint, torque produced by joints are saved to workspace. I have the same model but it analyzes the system in forward dynamics. So, joints in this model are actuated by torques obtained from inverse dynamics model. But the motion comes out from the forward dynamics model is not same with the inverse dynamics model, even it is not similar, it is completely absurd. I think I have checked everything but for sure not everything. Can anyone help me in thisp

Negative 72364 pSo i am developing some WCF REST WebService methods. The application that will consume them is a blackbox to me, i only know it is a Phonegap app java and the method definition. I also have the sourcecode for the equivalent JAVA rest services developed for the same app, but for a different system. The idea is that many HR systems can use the same app by implementing the webservices.p  pThe documentation says method expects strongapplicationjsonstrong  in the body of the request, which translates to regular String in .NET. Howeber I get a bad request when i deploy the webservice and have the PhonegapApp call this method.p  pSeeing the alreadyimplemented and working properly java implemenation of the service, the said method expects a strongJava.Io.InputStreamstrong as input in the body like that p  precodeOverride public Response manageSubAbsString codeEnv, String user, String password, String produit, String module, InputStream absSubFlux   do stuff  codepre  pAll parameters but the last one are URLQuery parameters, the Inputstream is expected in the body as i confirmed via Fiddler. So, since there is no InputStream equivalent in .NET ....is there a way i can develop a WCF REST method accepts such an input or what are my optionsp  pThank youp

That creates a new and different cert for me to handle in the app. Since the certs are not selfsigned, do I need to embed the cert in the app for comparison with the cert as it comes from the server or does iOSs SSL handling take care of the challenge for me. Maybe I can just use server trust without looking at the certp
Negative 72364 pIm looking for some guidance on how best to treat foreign assemblies as part of a distribution and loading.p  pThe basics is, Ive been working on a program that is designed to interact with another installed program. The other program has open .Net APIs designed for interfacing with third party applications like my own, however it is updated quite regularly. The changes arent always breaking changes, but this generally forces me to update my own application and cut a release for the public.p  pThe three main concepts Ive considered arep  ol lipPackage the foreign assemblies that contains only the APIs with my own application.  Considered cons are increased distro size. Forcing checks between the binaries of the installed foreign application and the local copy of the API binaries, and attempting to update them to remain in sync.pli lipLoad the foreign assemblies directly from where they exist in the foreign install folder. Considered cons are locking the binaries if the foreign app decides to update them.pli lipCopy the foreign assemblies to a temporary folder, and load them from there. Considered cons are time taken to copy dozens of files which include resource assemblies, and potentially leave them in the temporary folder.pli ol  pIs there a best practise, or another recognised way of doing thisp  pEDIT I should point out that my application uses WPF.p

Until now I show an error message to the user and he is in charge to submit by a button again the results to the server. What Im looking for is some Activity that remains persistent in the memory which runs later in the case that the transmission wasnt made. p  pAs an application case I use this to dynamically upload pictures for a Waypoint in a map if I pressed that waypoint. In some case it can happens that the connection to the mobile service provider isnt available mountains, forest, far apart from antenna. Then I want to leave the map Activity and switch to the detail view of this waypoint. In the success case I put the picture into my model classes and make an serialization. If the user clicks again on the same waypoint the picture is not loaded again. In the non success case I dont want to wait that the user clicks against on the waypoint to retrieve the image. In fact I need a background task, some sort of a queue that pictures of waypoints that are already visited on couldnt be retrieved are loaded until the communication part gives back a positive result and the image can be written into the model. The next time the user is pressing the Waypoint the picture will be then present.p  pAre there any best practices for making such a code implementation Is there any example around Is there a better way of doing this    p

Bootstrap3 does not give an easy time of how to resize the actual modal windows.... and it is further unfortunate that the standard modal windows are not big enough to actually fit all the information from the rows based upon actual information in the table.   p  pTherefore, my solution was to do codeltdiv classmodaldialog stylewidth calc100  100pxcodep  pHowever, what actually hit me, is this modal window may not necessarily need the code100pxcode or even code250pxcode based upon the actual width of the text that is in the mysql table.p  h3Example 1  Necessary Wide Modalh3  precode first  last  telephone  email                          address                     more...

Negative 72364 pIn my application, I have an import data feature. Currently when someone uploads the CSV file and submits the page, they see the spinner indicating that the file is uploading. After about a minute or so, the page will refresh once the import is complete.p  pI wanted to make the page a little bit friendlier by adding a progress bar of the import. My import class loops over every line in the CSV to import the data, so I added a bit of code so that after every few loops, it will write the percentage to a file with the intent that I can use an AJAX request to read that file and display the percentage.p  pI came to the point where I wanted to read the file, but any AJAX request I send after submitting the form doesnt ever return back to me. It seems that the server knows that the page is going to be refreshed so it doesnt even bother. Looking at the requests in the Network tab in Chromes Developer Tools shows the Status of pending, and none of them ever change.p  pIs there some way that I can keep making AJAX requests after I submit a form As a side note, the application needs to support IE9 so using the File API to submit the file through AJAX is not an option.p

Negative 72364 pI have SQL tables with inheritancep  ul liemhistoryem id, date, ip userid the supertable.li liemhistoryconnectionem id,useragent map users account connections.li liemhistoryemailem id, email map users email modifications.li ul  pThe goal is to log in my database different kind of history about an user. id column of both emhistoryconnectionem and emhistoryemailem is a primary key and a foreign key pointing to the emhistoryem table ids.p  pNow imagine that in a request, I dont need to have access to subtables columns, but I need to know which type of history it is.

The problem is I dont think it is very efficient about performance, because if I add a type column in the superclass emhistoryem I can simplify such query asp  precodeSELECT id,date,ip,userid,type FROM history codepre  pMy question is, do you think I need to add a type column for performance reasonp

Negative 72364 pWhen my app launches the map view, I request the iOS8 When In Use location permission.  Assume user grants that.p  pI would like to request the Always permission only when user optsin to my geofencing feature.  But calling CLLocationManager.requestAlwaysAuthorization has no effect because the current authorization status is no longer kCLAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined.p  pHow would one go about requesting the Always permission AFTER user has granted When In Use permission  I would think this is a common use case because apps should avoid asking for the Always permission unless needed.p

Negative 72364 pSo Im creating a pagination in jquery with bootstrap. My HTML works fine because I used it with a more ugly, lengthier code involving 200 or so lines of calling functions. Im trying to avoid that, hence the array.p  pAfter page 2, the entire code doesnt work, and I have no idea why. Ive simplified it to the greatest degree, and even tested it without any jquery and alerted the number to use from the array, and what string the array is using.p  precodevar paginationTable  [p1g1,p2g1,p3g1,p4g1,p5g1,  All spicer pages                        p1g2,p2g2,p3g2,p4g2,p5g2,  All saginaw pages                        p1g3,p2g3,p3g3,p4g3,p5g3,  All toyota pages                        p1g4,p2g4,p3g4,p4g4,p5g4]  All borgwarner pages var pageNum  0 var tabNum  paginationTable[pageNum]      function productInfobutton, productPage      button.clickfunction         productPage.show200          next.clickfunction         pageNum         tabNum  paginationTable[pageNum]          previous.clickfunction         pageNum  pageNum  1         tabNum  paginationTable[pageNum]          .arrayNumber.clickfunction         alerttabNum   and   pageNum       codepre  pThats my testing code. It works 100 right now. when I click the button to use .arrayNumber click function, it will display the pageNum and the tabNum correctly. For instance, it will display p1g1 and 0 and then when I do next, it will display p2g1 and 1. It will keep doing that. Therefore it works just fine.p  pHowever as soon as I the jQuery to it, it all falls apart.p  precodevar paginationTable  [p1g1,p2g1,p3g1,p4g1,p5g1,  All spicer pages                        p1g2,p2g2,p3g2,p4g2,p5g2,  All saginaw pages                        p1g3,p2g3,p3g3,p4g3,p5g3,  All toyota pages                        p1g4,p2g4,p3g4,p4g4,p5g4]  All borgwarner pages var pageNum  0 var tabNum  paginationTable[pageNum]      function productInfobutton, productPage      button.clickfunction         productPage.show200          next.clickfunction         pageNum         tabNum  paginationTable[pageNum]         .sectioninfo.hide200         tabNum.show300          previous.clickfunction         pageNum  pageNum  1         tabNum  paginationTable[pageNum]         .sectioninfo.hide200         tabNum.show300          .arrayNumber.clickfunction         alerttabNum   and   pageNum       codepre  pEverything works when I did it the longwinded method of jquery involving a bunch of classes and functions. Therefore my HTML and CSS arent conflicting it. Ive looked over my HTML a hundred times over, so I dont think its my HTML.

The code is set up to increment before anything happens, therefore I should be able to click .arrayNumber button and alert out the values. The values still output p2g1 and 1 even though the incrementing should have been ran.p

Negative 72364 pI had previously asked question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25178417setheaderwidthandcolumnproperlyduringfreezetheheaderingridviewSet header width and column properly during freeze the header in gridviewa By using those solution I found some problem with resolution So I added all columns in design itself.But still I am facing problem when columns have large length text.p  pI am trying to freeze the header of Gridview by using code given in this a hrefhttpwww.aspdotnetsuresh.com201111howtoimplementscrollablegridview.html relnofollowlinkap  pIt works but the problem is fixing the Gridview to full page size width. That is Gridview should appear full screen in the browser. It works properly if a content of column are small. But if a column has large length value then the data require about 2 or 3 lines inside a cell . In this case grid header width and columns width not being set equally and looks odd. I tried using HeaderStyleWidth and ItemStyleWidth with  vales.I didnt change anything in script. But it didnt help. So i tried to fix this by specifying HeaderStyleWidth and ItemStyleWidth for  each column. Then it works fine. But here I face another problem . That is due to fixed width the grid will not display full screen. For a high resolution display grid shows only about 75 width of screen.p  pSo how can it be fixed. I want grid to be appear full screen and columns and header should be aligned properly.p
Negative 72364 pIm looking to read data off the wire and send it to a function to parse the contents.  Due to the potential varying size of the message xml, i could read a whole message, more than one message, or a message portion. I am trying to implement code using the blockingcollection where i would call tryadd when i read the data off the wire and use a consumer thread to pull the data off the blocking collection to parse.  The examples seem pretty straight forward, but they only seem to work once, then exit.  I want the consumer to continuously parse as messages come in.

Negative 72364 pI have a bunch of line drawings done decades ago with India ink. Would like to know recommendations on the best way to convert curves that intersect in somewhat paradoxical ways sorta like Escher but without the limiting attachment to physics. Id like the curves to be minimalist in the sense of having as few control points in the stitchwise continuous chunks of cubic beziers. Usually if one uses Illustrator or Inkscape to convert line art to vectors the resultant paths have far too many control points to be able, later, to animate, via SMIL or JavaScript.

Negative 72364 pFairly simple question How should I use codepm.stochasticcode I have read some blog posts that claim codepm.stochasticcodeexpects a negative log valuep  precodepm.stochasticobservedTrue def loglikevaluedata    some calculations that generate a numeric result   return np.logresult codepre  pI tried this recently but found really bad results. Since I also noticed that some people used np.log instead of np.log, I give it a try and worked much better. What is really expecting codepm.stochasticcode Im guessing there was a small confusion on the sign required due to a very popular example using something like codenp.log11t1t0code which was written as codenp.log1t1t0codep  pAnother question What is this decorator doing with the codevaluecode argument As I understand it, we start with some proposed value for the priors that need to enter in the likelihood and the idea of codepm.stochasticcode is basically produce some number to compare this likelihood to the number generated by the previous iteration in the sampling process. The likelihood should receive the codevaluecode argument and some values for the priors, but Im not sure if this is all codevaluecode is doing because thats the only required argument and yet I can writep  precodepm.stochasticobservedTrue def loglikevalue[1]   data  [3,5,1]  some data    some calculations that generate a numeric result   return np.logresult codepre  pAnd as far as I can tell, that produces the same result as before. Maybe, it works in this way because I added codeobservedTruecode to the decorator. If I would have tried this in a stochastic variable with codeobservedFalsecode by default, codevaluecode would be changed in each iteration trying to obtain a better likelihood.p

Negative 72364 pI checked the other answers here in stackoverflow but cudnt find my solution. Somebody pls help me find out the problem. I get the following error while calling OAuth2 endpoint API strongONLY on local dev serverstrong, it strongworks wellstrong in production server without setting the root IP.I just found that it also works in genymotion emulator with 10.0.3.2 urlp  precode   java.net.SocketTimeoutException failed to connect to 10.0.2.2 port 80 after 20000ms codepre  pHow do I run OAUTH 2 API on local Dev server, I tried the following  p  precodeQuoteApi.Builder builder  new QuoteApi.BuilderAndroidHttp.newCompatibleTransport, new AndroidJsonFactory, credential builder.setRootUrlhttp10.0.2.2ahapi192.168.0.55 or 0.0.0.0 doesnt work either, running in device emulator in dev server , deleting this line works well in production server codepre  pI read google doc a hrefhttpscloud.google.comappenginedocsjavaendpointsconsumeandroid relnofollowherea , the only thing left to do is make the server listen to 0.0.0.0. I dont know how to do it or if it will work.p
Negative 72364 pI am attempting to retrieve a WWWAuthenticate response header to grab OAUTH realm information from a site.  To do this, Im issuing the following call in JavaScriptp  precode.ajax      url httpsserverresource.svc,     type GET,                         beforeSend functionxhr         xhr.setRequestHeaderAuthorization, Bearer     ,     headers  AuthorizationBearer   .donefunctiondata,textStatus,jqXHR       alertjqXHR.getResponseHeaderWWWAuthenticate   .failfunctionjqXHR,textStatus,errorThrown       alertjqXHR.getResponseHeaderWWWAuthenticate   codepre  pIn fiddler I can see that the initial response from the server contains the WWWAuthenticate header I am expecting.  However, my .ajax call results in a total of 4 calls to the server as it attempts to negotiate authentication and only the headers from the last call are available at the time the .done or .fail method runs. By that point, the WWWAuthenticate header is not available. p  pSo, is there a way to hook into the backandforth communications so the headers from that initial response can be retrievedp
Negative 72364 pemPlease note that the question is specifically intended for Dynamics CRM. Im hoping for a proprietary functionality that extends or replaces the common web development. Hence, this question isnt a duplicate, although it might seem so once one sees CORS and this yet another duck asking about CORS... typo intended.emp  pIm trying to make a call to an outside word from CRM and, of course, I run into CORS issues. Now, I have very little control over the server side that the call is directed to, so I wonder if its possible to work around it from the client somehow.p  pThe optimal solution would be if the server developers allowed calls from different domains but theres a risk that they wont do that. What are my options then, besides writing a custom service layer that opens for CORS towards calls from CRM strongandstrong speaks to the third party serverp  pThe nag is as follows of course, from the URL line the call performs perfectly well.p  blockquote   pCrossOrigin Request Blocked The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at a hrefhttpsyaba.daba.doolistp1[]ampp20ampamp1415714629958 relnofollowhttpsyaba.daba.doolistp1[]ampp20ampamp1415714629958a. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.p blockquote

Negative 72364 pIs there any reason to use the local security permissions and set up sharing for specific usersgroups when youre also using roles out of AD Our company has multiple security groups in AD and Id like to be able to just use those to control access to the web site.

I know its using AD because I can create a new group in AD and have the code determine if a user is in it or not. p  pThanks, let me know if you need more info.p

Negative 72364 pWe need to build our system for both .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.5.1 Our system is a reporting engine composed of a bunch of DLLs. Many of our customers are still on the .NET 2.0 runtime, hence we must have a .NET 2.0 version.p  pHowever, we also need to have 2 optional DLLs that require .NET 4.0, one for the OData API and one for the new Oracle connector. Both of these require the .NET 4.0 runtime.p  pIs there a way to use the existing solution amp project files and from the command line tell it to build for 3.5 or 4.5.1 Or do we need to duplicate all the solution amp project filesp  pthanks  davep

Negative 72364 pThis problem has been puzzling me for a while now, let me break it down a bit.p  pI need to query two different collections with the same logic of codeWherecode, codeSelectcode statements and things, and I dont know this logic in advance. Say I have two collectionsp  precodevar arrayOne  Germane, Henry, Charissa, Evan, Zorita var arrayTwo  Athena, Darryl, Zelenia, Honorato, Macon codepre  pAnd some filtering logicp  precodevar result  arrayOne.Wherex gt x.Length gt 3.Selectx gt x.Length codepre  pHow do I copy this logic to the second array without copying the code itself Theres a way to do this via delegates which is my current onep  precodeFuncltIEnumerableltstringgt, IEnumerableltintgtgt query  x gt x.Wherex gt x.Length gt 3.Selectx gt x.Length var result1  queryarrayOne var result2  queryarrayTwo  codepre  pBut I need to build queries progressively, not inline, likep  precodevar query  SomeQueryGenerator.CreateQuery query.Wherex gt x.Length gt 3 ifsomeCondition       Totally random query     query.Wherex gt x.Length  2  0   var result  queryarrayOne codepre  hr  pThis was the question. Now let me show what I have done so far and break my case down even morep  pThe problem arose when we tried to import of loads of data into our DB. This data has about 20k rows and it can contain some duplicates which we dont want to store, so its very important to check if we already have specific rows it checks by some legal IDs. We use NHibernate as ORM and by default it flushes codeINSERTcodes and codeUPDATEcodes quite often, before every codeSELECTcode statement or at any other time. p  pThe problem is that these flushes take very long, so long that it takes up to 10 hours to load all 20k rows into DB. The most obvious way is to set our current codeSession.FlushModecode to codeFlushMode.Nevercode and flush it at the end of the import. This way 20k rows import for about 10 minutes. But the problem is that this way when we query, we dont see our duplicates as they are not in the DB yet, and our queries like code.Wherex gt x.LegalId  someIdcode dont find anything even when there strongisstrong actually a saved row. I decided to utilize our codeSessioncode 1st level cache for this task, as all of our saved entites are first written in its cache and then to DB when the codeFlushcode occurs it may be not actually written to DB until our codetransaction.Commitcode, but it will properly find these entites with a query. Ive set up a helper class that can query both cache and original DB and it properly finds entites in cache that are not yet in DB inline delegate example abovep  pBut I need to be able to query things progressively, and Im totally lost now. We cant just get an codeExpressioncode from one codeIQueryablecode and paste it to another. We cant create some dummy codeIQueryablecode or codeIEnumerablecode object and pass it around, throwing code.Wherecode or code.Selectcode because we will be tied up to a particular source, and we cant swap the sources either at least I have not found a way to do it.p  pI need some new thoughts on this question, thanks in advance.p  p UPDATE on data duplicationsp  pWe cant preprocess our data, let me explain why.p  pLets say we have buildings in our files. Some buildinds can belong to an organization. If we encounter a building with a specified organization, we need to create it and store in DB. This way we have not only buildings which themselves are not duplicated, but their organizations too. Its totally possible that several buildings will have same organizations, but we dont need to create these organizations more than one time. Of course we can first parse this file, fetch all organizations, import them first and then import constructions only, but this is too complicated, and, as Ive stated in a comment, the problem is more generic one, its outside of the scope of this import logicp

If there are e.g. 100000 items then 100000 objects will be created. In Approach One each object will have a reference myObject to it so they are not eligible for GCp  pWhere as in Approach Two with every loop iteration you are removing reference from the object created in previous iteration. so surely objects start becoming eligible after the first loop iteration.p  pOr is it a trade off between performance and code readability amp maintainabilityp  pWhat have I misunderstoodp  pNote Assuming I care about performance and myObject is not needed after the loop.p  pThanks In Advancep

Negative 72364 pI am new for developing.I have opted for php to learn coding.So I might make mistake as I learn by myself, kindly clarify my doubts. I have problem in uploading files using php to a folder.What I really do is, I upload a file and the file is saved in a folder and the name of the file alone inserted in the database. While uploading the file I do copy the file to another folder which will be used for the editing purpose so that the original file will not be disturbed.Here the problem I get is, the file is uploaded successfully as well as the name too inserted in database. But it take much time to get upload even the size of the file is small.It works good while I test using my local but when I come in real time this issueslow uploading I face. What the person incharge in uploading do is, uploading a file and opening a new browser and upload another file. When the new browser is opened the files get uploaded but in the previous browser it is still in process. The code I have written to copy the file to another folder is not executed as the new browser is opened to upload another set of files. I am using xamp cp v3.2.1.To minimize the execution time I have set the default Maximum execution time to 30.

When I published the app, I only updated the same version version 1. Changing the version number to a new version seemed to make the execution and access permissions work correctly. Now the web app is fine.p

Negative 72364 pIve been struggling in Python with how to group records from a csv based on hour within a field containing dates and times. The file contains approximately 1,000,000 records. Ive read the file into a Pandas dataframe and created a two dimensional NumPy array such that each record is a sublist within the NumPy array, e.g.p  precodethis is a NumPy array npdata  [somedata, 20140701 081821, somedata, somedata, somedata, somedata, etc],  [somedata, 20140701 100140, somedata, somedata, somedata, somedata, etc], etc...] codepre  pDate amp time, which is a string, is always in the same position 1 in every sublist. Ive created the variable hourlist, that is a list of 24 empty sublists. Id like to iterate over npdata to populate each of the 24 sublists in hourlist with subsets of sublists from npdata that contain the same hour in the date amp time field. E.g. all npdata sublists with datetime 00xxxx would be in one sublist of hourlist, all 01xxxx in another, all 020000 in another, etc from 0 through 23 hours. Ive been trying to figure this out but keep hitting walls. Based on some Google searches, I believe that the datetime.strptime class method should be used as part of the solution, but Im not understanding how.p  pI really appreciate any tips advice.p

Negative 72364 pI am currently working on a project to develop an android app using codeIonicCordovacode. In this app we need to automatically connect to a wifi network using  codeEAP TTLScode and to do so we are developing a cordova plugin. p  pAs many tutorials suggest, we started the development by creating an Android app that did exactly what we wanted. Next, we turned it into a plugin. Up to that point everything was great, we achieved the desired functionality and added the plugin to the Ionic project without errors. p  pNow, when we execute the command  codeionic buildcode  we receive many errors related to the imports used in the plugin, for examplep  precodeimport android.net.wifi.WifiConfiguration  import android.net.wifi.WifiManager  import android.net.wifi.WifiConfiguration import android.net.wifi.WifiEnterpriseConfig import android.net.wifi.WifiManager import android.net.ConnectivityManager import android.net.NetworkInfo codepre  pFrom all the research done before the development we understood that any app that you could be develop directly for Android could be turn into a plugin. Therefore, I believe that we are missing an important step in the process or taking the wrong approach to the development.p  pMay anyone help me solve this or give me pointers to the proper way to build an IonicCordova pluginp  pHere is a copy of the error logp  precode  ConnectivityChangeReceiver.java19 error cannot find symbol import com.wbinnova.adsfinetworkplugin.R

Negative 72364 pIm attempting to create a loading screen that draws a circle while my app makes network requests. The amount drawn of the circle is meant to represent how close the request is to finishing. However there is a serious delay 8 seconds between the network request and the animation. After A LOT of searching I havent found anyone that has had this problem before so Im very desperate.p  pMy setup right now is that an NSProgress object will be updated as a request is being made and will trigger a KVO Notification with the NSProgress object in the userInfo. This is the same method found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma193808122589965herea.p  precodeClient.m  voidobserveValueForKeyPathNSString keyPath ofObjectidobject changeNSDictionary change contextvoid context      if [keyPath isEqualToStringfractionCompleted] ampamp [object isKindOfClass[NSProgress class]]          NSProgress progress  NSProgress object         NSDictionary userInfo  progressprogress         [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationNameFractionCompleted objectself userInfouserInfo]       codepre  pThen the view controller that is listening for the notification will update the LoadingProgressView with the fractionCompleted of the NSProgress object that it receives.p  precodeMainViewController.m [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverself selectorselectorupdateProgress nameFractionCompleted objectnil] ... ...  voidupdateProgressNSNotificationnote      NSProgress prog  note.userInfo[progress]     [self.progressIndicatorView updateProgressCGFloatprog.fractionCompleted]  codepre  pNow within the LoadingProgressView, the CAShapeLayers strokeEnd property is set as the fractionCompleted value.

At that point the entire circle is animated at once.p  pI have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA why this is happening and its driving me crazy. I can clearly see using the debugger that the strokeEnd property is being updated in realtime and yet the LoadingProgressView refuses to rerender until much later. Any help is very much appreciated. Thanks.p  pEDIT OK so a temporary solution was to fork a new thread with a delay of 0 to update the progress view for each notification. However this seems like poor thread management since I could be creating over a hundred different threads to do the same task.
