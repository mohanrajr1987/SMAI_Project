Sentinels are   Regular types that can be used to denote the end of a range. A   sentinel and an iterator denoting a range shall be EqualityComparable.   A sentinel denotes an element when an iterator i compares equal to the   sentinel, and i points to that element.

Positive 8125 pI have a string that I want to strip of everything inbetween two specific characters. For example given codehello there worldcode I want to remove everything between codecode and codecode including those delimiters, in order to obtain codehello worldcode. It needs to handle the scenario where there are any number of nested results for that pattern. For example codehello there mr  world and all those who inhabit itcode should become codehello world and those who inhabit itcode. p  pIt seems it needs to find the inner most result and work its way outwards to prevent removing incorrect ranges. For example if it simply found the first codecode and the first codecode it would generate codehello  world and those who inhabit itcode which is incorrect. If it were to remove everything inbetween the first codecode and the last codecode, it would remove content that shouldnt be removed and result in codehello those who inhabit itcode.p  pSo how can this be accomplishedp  pOne could use the coderangeOfStringcode API to get the first occurrence of a string and use those ranges to remove characters via  codestringByReplacingCharactersInRangecode, or perhaps one could use a regex pattern. Im not sure how best to utilize those to obtain the necessary behavior.p

Positive 8125 pThe problem I have is the following  I have a set of subtitles, each with a start and end time. Im looking for an efficient way to determine, given a time value, which subtitle should be displayed.p  pRanges and TreeRangeSet quickly emerged as the way to go, but unfortunately the Range class turned out to be not extendable, in order for me to add a String attribute to it. The idea was p  ol liConstructs all customRanges, CustomRangestartTime, endTime, subtitle, and add those to my TreeRangeSetli liGiven a timePosition, get the CustomRange  treeRangeSet.rangeContainingtimePositionli liFinally, if customRange is not null, return customRange.getSubtitleli ol  pNow I could do something like wrap my Ranges in CustomRanges and store those in a list beside my TreeRangeSet. This way after receiving a Range from my treeRangeSet I could lookup the corresponding CustomRange and therefore obtain the subtitle String. But this would make using a TreeRangeSet completely useless p  pMy question is can I still use Range and TreeRangeSet to solve my problem, but maybe in a more clever way  Or are their other alternatives to those classes  My goal is to avoid having to implement from scratch the tree structure myself.p

Negative 8125 pIm writing a windows service that once started will run every X hours.  The process it completes is fairly intensive, so I want to use a background worker.  Im using a Settings file to store both the hours between runs and the last time the service ran.p  pIm not exactly sure the best way to do this  that is, I want the service to idle using as few resources as possible, and when it runs, it needs to run in the background worker, report what it did, and then go back into idle mode.p  pIve thought about using 2 background workers.  The first worker would be a private local variable for the service that runs something like thisp  precodewhile true        create new background worker and run        Thread.SleepSettings.Default.SleepTimeHours  3600000  codepre  pwith a sub worker that is created each iteration of the loop, and destroyed when completed.  To support cancellation, I think I would have to have a local instance of the second worker available in the service, but it will be null if the process currently is not running.  When the secondary worker completes, it would send out my reporting, set the last run time in the settings file, and then dispose of the worker and set the reference to null.p  pIm wondering if there is a better way to do this or a best practice.p  pThanksp

Negative 8125 pI know the basic difference as codeReleaseComObjectcode only decreases some counter by one and codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode decreases it to zero. p  pSo what I usually hear is, call codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode because then you are sure that the COM object is really released. p  pBut this makes me wonder, there is a point to this counter right Arent you breaking that mechanism if you always call codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode. If that counter is not emoneem before you call codeReleaseComObjectcode, is there not probably a reason for itp  pWhat could cause it to be higher than one when it should not bep  pThanks in advance.p  pPS My COM experience only consists of using Excel Interop. Not sure if this question is local to that domain i.e. outside Office Interop, codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode is not often used.p  h2Update 1h2  pThe a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvcblogarchive20060920762884.aspxarticlea Dan mentioned talks about using codeReleaseComObjectcode when youre done. As I understand from the a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvcblogarchive20060920762884.aspxarticlea, this is the normal way. I think that if you do this consistently it should work fine. In a comment to the a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvcblogarchive20060920762884.aspxarticlea the author suggests someone to call codeReleaseComObjectcode in a loop until it is really released the a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvcblogarchive20060920762884.aspxarticlea is from 2006, so this is analogues to calling codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode. But he also states that this could be dangerous. p  blockquote   pIf you really want to the RCW to call Release at a particular point in the code, you can call ReleaseComObject in a loop until the return value reaches zero.  This should ensure the RCW will call Release.  However, if you do that, be warned, when the other managed references try to use that RCW, it will cause an exception.p blockquote  pThis leads me to believe that it is indeed emnotem a good idea to always call codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode, as you can cause exceptions elsewhere. As I see it now, you should only call this if you are absolutely sure that you can.p  pStill, I have little experience in this matter. I dont know how I can be sure. If the counter is increased when it should not be, is it not better to fix that problem If so, then I would say codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode is more of a hack than a best practice.p

Negative 8125 pI was just wanting some explanation as to what is going on once you have split your tables out into a back end file, and set an mde out for use. p  pWhen a user accesses the mde, is the mdb still required to get to the tabes or in order to make it work Let say I put these access apps on a shared drive for folks to use. If I split the be end on to the shared drive, and placed the mde on the shared drive, would I the mdb have to exist for that version mde to work communicate with the tables Or does the mde sort of speak to the mdb which speaks to the tablesp  pHope this question makes sense.p  pThanks p  pEDITp  pOne additional question I have an MDE set up on a network share drive, but I was not certain as to whether or not I had to have the mdb present on the same share drive as my mde and back end tables....if not then I would prefer to not have it there because user insist on getting into it, and making copies of it and such.....p  pBut my question is, as I said I put A MDE out on a shared drive, which means there is one that about 1012 people max, share, and the likelihood that even half these folks would be in there at the same time is very very unrealistic. But I recently read that I should have an MDE for each person Is that true What is a good example of distributing one to each person I have only ever gone with the one on a shared appraoch before, and was unaware that this was, if in fact it is, a bad approachp  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 8125 pI am trying to deal with a very large dataset.  I have k  4200 matrices varying sizes which must be compared combinatorially, skipping nonunique and self comparisons.  Each of kk12 comparisons produces a matrix, which must be indexed against its parents i.e. can find out where it came from.  The convenient way to do this is to triangularly fill a kbyk cell array with the result of each comparison.  These are 100 X 100 matrices, on average.  Using single precision floats, it works out to 400 GB overall.br I need to 1 generate the cell array or pieces of it without trying to place the whole thing in memory and 2 access its elements and emtheirem elements in like fashion.  My attempts have been inefficient due to reliance on MATLABs codeevalcode as well as codesavecode and codeclearcode occurring in loops.  p  precodefor i1k     [,m]  sizedatai     curvar  [H int2stri]      if i  1 saveFileName end  If using a single MAT file and need to create it.     eval[curvar   cell1,ki]     for ji1k         [,n]  sizedataj         eval[curvar i,j  zerosm,n,single]         eval[curvar i,j  comparedatai,dataj]     end     savecurvar,curvar  Add append when using a single MAT file.     clearcurvar end codepre  pThe other thing I have done is to perform the split when codemodij12,maxfactorkk12  0code.  This divides the result into the largest number of samesize pieces, which seems logical.  The indexing is a little more complicated, but not too bad because a linear index could be used.  p  pDoes anyone knowsee a better wayp

While on nix codentohlcode has worked a treat under Windows use of codentohlcode requires the use of codeWs232.dllcode Winsock.p  pSuch a dependency is one which I would rather eliminate.  The simplest way to do this appears to be to write my own endianswapping function a trivial exercise, considering performance is not a real concern.  However, this requires a way to determine the endianness of the system my library is being compiled on so I can codeifdefcode out the swapping function on big endian systems.p  pAs there appears to be no standard preprocessor definition for endianess it appears as if it is necessary to determine it using my build system cmake.

Negative 8125 pI am working on a Java project which makes heavy use of Observer pattern to make sure every data object state is up to date. I grew tired of maintaining this mess and am trying to implement a solution that would decouple the terrors of Observer pattern from my precious data objects. p  pI was able to abstract away the details of this project to say that the problem I am trying to solve is followingp  blockquote   pThere exists a set of objects representing expressions, each of which can depend on the values of other expressions.p      pThe following two operations are requiredp      pstrongeval Retrieve the value of a given expressionstrongp      pThis operation should return the up to date value of the expression which would be returned if all the expression dependencies would re reevaluated right now. However, no expression should be evaluated more than once unless its cache is invalidated by the second operationp      pstrongupdate Modify a given expressionstrongp      pThis operation invalidates the cache for the expression and for all the currently cached expressions that depend on it directly or transitively.p      pIn addition, some convenient memoryleakfree way to manage lifetime of the expressions is required.p blockquote  pDesired usage example in pseudocodep  precodeExpression a  variable1 Expression b  variable3 Expression s  suma,b assert4  evals     causes evaluation of expressions a, b and s assert4  evals     does not cause any evaluations,                               the result should be taken from cache setValuea,2            contains update internally,                                invalidating caches for a and s assert5  evals     causes evaluation of a and s codepre  pOK, the functional part is over, here goes the memory management part.p  pThere must be some easy way for the developer to manage the expression graph. Ideally, the allocation should be done with codenew Suma,bcode, developer should have the freedom to pass around expression instances as he likes, without much knowledge about cache, and deallocation should happen automatically with no effort from the developer side. p  pAnd there must not be any memory leaks. That is when an expression is deallocated, there must not be anything left in the memory associated with it. For example, if observer pattern is to be used for invalidation, the expression must be removed from all observer lists.p  pThe question isp  pstrongWhat would be your approach to implementing this in your favourite languagestrongp  pNongarbagecollected and functional languages are welcome too, especially functional because I dont understand how to approach this problem in pure functional at all.p  pThe best solution from my point of view would be the one with the least possibility of developer error.p  pI am intentionally not posting my current implementation details yet because I think I have found a fundamental flaw in my implementation and I dont see any way around it. I will post it later though.p

Negative 8125 pCan someone recommend an open source scheduler that would lend itself to being embeddedbr as the heart of a specialized web based scheduler A C or Javabased scheduler would be mybr first choice to work with.p  pThe finished project would allow someone, via the internet, to add, delete and change tasks  scheduled on the local machine by monthly, weekly, daily, and by time of day. The tasks  would be fairly simple to display messages and play WAV files on the local machine on scheduled dates and at times specified by the remote programmer.  p  pOk, why  Well, my wife and myself moved her mother to our town a couple of years ago, because she could not or would not tend to her own affairs including eating and taking her insulin  on a rigorous schedule.  She is a type one diabetic.  She is a widow and had been living by herself for about ten years.  My wife had been tending to her bills and affairs remotely from our home a thousand miles away.  My motherinlaw had a dozen different doctors that did not of one another and she was being way overmedicated with one medication counteracting another.  We found out that she had not been careful with her diabetes and that this had resulted in a trip by EMS to the emergency room on the average of every other month.  Strangely, she is not emtotallyem senile, though her short term memory is pretty much shot, but, she is, and always has been, a dyedinthewool slacker.  My wife and I, both, work full time jobs, from before daylight until after dark, still, my wife manages to call her mother three times a day, to tell her to eat and take her insulin and then spends about two hours each evening with her mother before coming home.  This machine would be, essentially a headless system that served no function other than to flash preprogrammed messages to small monitor and play audio nags at the appropriate times.  Get up and your eat breakfast, Its time to do your insulin, Give the dog its pill, Get ready to go to your doctors appointment and so on.  With no keyboard or mouse and the front panel switches disabled, she is enough of a Luddite that I dont think that she will think of pulling the cord out of the wall socket.  p  pAnyway, thats where Im trying to go.  Im a reluctant programmer, but, I have written some large and complex programs over the years and in a number of different languages and to make the wifes life a bit easier, I can do this.  A scheduler that could be modified to become a large block of code within the overall program, would save me a great deal of time and head scratching.p

Ive read that people have implemented swap file like functionality using memory mapped files in their apps but I dont understand how this would work. Does anyone knowp  pI think the general idea is that, if my program wanted to use an int array that was the size of say 20Mb, I could create the data for this array in a 20Mb file and then use the memory mapped file feature to transparently bring into memory the parts of the file I current need to read and write to.

Negative 8125 pI am trying to customize the springws servlet context in a similar manner as I did for my spring context. For the initial context initialized when the server starts, I have extended the codeContextLoadercode and implemented the codeServletContextListenercode class, which is similar to what the codeorg.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListenercode class does. I am able to customize the initial context by overriding the codecustomizeContextServletContext servletContext, ConfigurableWebApplicationContext applicationContextcode method, and addremove optional context xml files based on properties. I was able to set this class as the listener in my codeweb.xmlcode file instead of the default codeContextLoaderListenercode from Spring, and it works as expected.p  pI am looking to take a similar approach for the springws servlet context all of the beans defined in codeWEBINFspringwsservlet.xmlcode, but I have not been able to find any solution to this. The only thing I can think of doing is having my custom context loader also generate an xml file with the optional beans to include, and have the codespringwsservletcode context import this. However, this is a hackjob of a solution and I think there has to be a better approach. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to customize the springws servlet context when the first web service is calledp  pI am using Spring 2.5.6 amp SpringWS 1.5.9p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 8125 pI created an app that has a selfbuilt photo tool. When I test Debug amp Ad Hoc, it works fine. It is built using a UIScrollView and adds each Photo to the UIScroll view as the photos slot is scrolled onto the screen.p  pBut now the app is in the App Store and the leftright swipetoloadphoto feature is not loading the photos. This is the same situation on iPhone 3G and iPhone 4.p  pAny ideas why  how this could happenp  pstrongADDITIONAL INFOstrongp  pUpon further inspection and thinking about how I created this, here are some other notes.p  pIf you swipe leftright after the first image appears, the app begins to lazy load the next photo in sequence, depending on which way you are scrolling. If you get to the slot where an image is supposed to load and the image has not yet loaded, you see a UIActivityIndicator. p  pWith the App Store version, I am usually just seeing blank screens. This makes me think it is lazy loading the images but not adding them to the subview, or not bringing them to the front of the view. If I scroll fast enough to outpace the lazy loading, I can get an image to eventually appear in one of the slots  so it is probably an issue with my lazy loading  but that doesnt answer why does this work in ad hoc but fail in the app store versionp

Negative 8125 pMany popular fonts seem to be available for web use exclusively from a hrefhttpwebfonts.fonts.comhttpwebfonts.fonts.comap  pHowever, it works in a very strange way. They dont give you the direct font URLs, instead they give you a CSS file that refers to the font files. I think the font URLs in the CSS are probably transient and change over time, to prevent unauthorized use. So you have to use their CSS, you cant directly incorporate the font file URLs as far as I know.p  pThe CSS in turn is not what I think it should be.

Instead of using fontweight, you have to make up a custom CSS class for mybold or something like that to set the fontfamily to Foo Bold. i.e. they break standard CSS. What am I missingp  pMaybe theyll fix this sometime. But in the meantime, strongcan anyone think of a sane workaroundstrong Theres no way to define family Foo in terms of their Foo Bold etc. codefontfacecode definitions is there Write some crazy JavaScript to extract the URLs from their CSS on the fly and then define my own fontface dynamicallyp  puse a different font with another service does not count as an answer  yes I have thought of that, but Im wondering if theres a way to fix webfonts.fonts.com by somehow tweaking their CSS with my own CSS rules or JavaScript.p

Negative 8125 pAlright heres the scenario. Im creating a dynamic website with JavaJSPJS. Im using the Java to access a database and query a table to get information. Instead of passing that query to the JSP, I decided to create a JS file with a class in it with all of that information. Im basically building a store locator that will update itself with new storeslocations whenever the user presses a button. Obviously they need to update the table first but you get the pointp  pAnd now onto my problem. Im creating the file by opening a stream. But first I check to see if the file exists and if it does delete it, because I dont want to keep writing to that same file every time a user clicks the button.p  precodeFileWriter fstream  new FileWritertest.js codepre  pThe location of the file goes to my Eclipse folder directory, obviously.

Negative 8125 pIm having a problem with my animations flickering upon completion. Im using a mix of jQuery and CSS to slide divs, and my problem seems unique to me. The exact problem consists of sliding a 200 width div 50 left and right, using  codeelement.csstransform,translate50,0pxcode in jQuery and codetransitionall 0.43s easeinoutcode in the CSS all proper browser prefixes are iterated as necessary.p  pThe animation takes place flawlessly until the point of completion, and then for a split second it flashes the original state, and then back to the transitioned state. Except for the flicker of the original state instead of the transitioned state for about 0.001 seconds, that code works exactly as planned.p  pAn especially odd sideoccurrence is that I have custom JS, not actual dropdowns in both states, which jQuery closes before the sliding animation takes place, but when the flicker takes place, it shows the dropdown still expanded. When sliding back, the dropdown is closed as it should be. These previously worked together flawlessly, and I havent touched either piece of code today.p  pIts literally like its taking a screenshot of what the page state was before the animation, doing exactly what I want it to do, and then flashing the screenshot of the before state to taunt me deliberately.p  pI cant post a JSfiddle unfortunately, because I cant reproduce the problem in isolation, and Im quite certain that my employer would not like me to post the entire code here. Im sorry I cant provide more. Thanks for any help you can give.p  blockquote   piTo any wondering, Ive looked at quite a few other examples where   codeoverflowhiddencode on the parent element will stop certain animations   from flickering and jumping to their final positions without animating   the last bit.

Negative 8125 pI have a Client and a Server. The Server retrieves a list of applications Each containing a Path, Name and Icon from its desktop.

Negative 8125 pMy application is in ASP.net MVC3.p  pI have a table of elements. An element can have child elements, but a child element cannot. In the table, if the element has children, they are listed in a ul. A user can select the items in the list to remove it from that parent. When this happens, the element is removed from the list, and a partial view is rendered that makes a new row in the table for that element since it is no longer a child. Elements that are not children and dont have children of their own are able to be combined with other elements by selecting the element you want to combine it with from a dropdown. My problem is that when you remove an element from a parent, the dropdown created for the table row in the partial view does not have the functionality needed.p  pI think that this may be due to the fact that my javascript function to combine elements is in the codedocument.readyfunction  ...code and that dropdown is no there on page creation.p  pis there a way to add my code.combineDropdown.changefunction  ...code to an element that has been created dynamicallyp

Negative 8125 pHi Im using AndEngine in my Android app. Im wondering if there is a method that detects when an object in this case an object of AnalogOnScreenControls goes from being touched to untouched I want to set a specific command that executes only when someone lets go of the analog stick entity. The controls also use float values to detect what position theyre in, so it could also be a method for when the values go from some value other than zero to zero, since the variables are set to zero when the controls are idle. Thanks for any help in advancep

Negative 8125 pI recently did Herokus requested database migration from a shared database to Postgres. I followed Herokus directions carefully, and it all went fine until the last step removing the old shared database. At that point, my app went down with the something went wrong message, and its been down ever since going on two weeks now.p  pNote that the app was still working after the step in which I switched to the new database, and according to heroku config, it is using the new database. It shouldnt care about the old one disappearing. The logs say nothing other than 500 errors.p  pI submitted an urgent support request to Heroku, but they were not helpful. They just said that my data is still there but, Your application isnt logging so its not clear why this is happening but it doesnt appear to be due to the migration. That was a week ago, so its not looking like theyre going to do anything more.p  pI agree that the problem shouldnt be due to the migration, but given that Ive made no changes to the app except the migration, and that it died exactly when I removed the old database, I dont see what else it could be.p  pMy app is probably pretty old at this point Rails 3.0.3, so my only thought now is to update everything to the latest versions and redeploy. The app is used to record merit badges and rank advancements for our local Boy Scout troop, so I really need to get it running again. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 8125 pI needed to go through an XML file looking for certain tags whose contents were humanrecognizable but not regexrecognizable and to work on those tags. I put together a keyboard macro that did the work I needed, then tried to use the following elisp to let me step through the file and just press kbdykbd or kbdnkbd for each tag instead of going back and forth between movement commands and macro executions.p  precodewhile t   progn     searchforward ltNamegt     movebeginningofline nil     if yornp Problem          calllastkbdmacro       nextline        codepre  pHowever, when I kbdMkbd evaluated this, it got to codeyornpcode and then emacs became unresponsive. I am using emacs on an OS X 10.7 machine. In Activity Monitor, emacs was taking up the normal amount of RAM and CPU time, not making escalating resource requests, so I dont think I ran into an infinite loop. Emacs simply stopped responding to typing and clicks altogether, including things like repeatedly hitting Escape or kbdCgkbd. An additional detail the one codeyornpcode interaction I got was a dialog box, not in the minibuffer, which was strange  I clicked Yes on it and the dialog box went away, which was the last interaction I was able to get with emacs before it disappeared into deep space.p  pIs there something in the above elisp code thats inherently dangerous My thought was that the codesearchforwardcode would fail at the end of the buffer, signal an error, and the loop would end.p

Negative 8125 pNow I am building a C project with CMake. I find CMake will introduce unnecessary library dependency in the project. Take an example, my project is composed of four parts 1lib1 2lib2 3lib3 and 4appp  precodelib1                lib2                lib3                app codepre  pThe source code in codeappcode will build a program, which relies on the dynamic library created in codelib3code. codelib3code however, relies on the dynamic library created in codelib2code and so on. I build the following CMake scripts to build a VC10 project    strong1 Root CMakeListsstrongp  precode   cmakeminimumrequired VERSION 2.6       project test       addsubdirectorylib1      addsubdirectorylib2      addsubdirectorylib3      addsubdirectoryapp codepre  pstrong2 lib1 CMakeLists.txtstrongp  precodeadddefinitions DEXPSTL  addlibrarylib1 SHARED lib1.cxx codepre  pstrong3 lib3 CMakeLists.txtstrongp  precodeadddefinitions DEXPSTL  addlibrarylib3 SHARED lib3.cxx targetlinklibrarieslib3 lib2 codepre  pstrong4 app CMakeLists.txtstrongp  precodeaddexecutableapp main.cpp targetlinklibrariesapp lib3 codepre  pWith these CMake scripts I have no problem in building a VC10 project. However, I notice that CMake will introduce unnecessary library dependency between libraries for VC10. For example, for the codeappcode application program, it only relies on one library, and that is,  codelib3code. However, in VC10 project, I notice that it added the following additional dependencies p  precode..lib3Debuglib3.lib ..lib2Debuglib2.lib ..lib1Debuglib1.lib codepre  pIn the CMake script, however, only codelib3code dependency is supposed to be introduced. For our example project, it may not be a problem, but in other cases the introduced redundant libraries can lead to compiling errors as they demand the proper searching paths. I am therefore wondering whether there is a way to eliminate these unnecessary libraries. Thanksp

Negative 8125 pHeres the issue. I have an application where I want to press a button, start a new activity that displays a list of items, allow the user to select any number of items, click submit and send that data to the original activity that called the new activity with the list of items. Heres the basic structurep  precodeActivity A gt Activity B select items, press submit gt [already running] Activity A receive sent items codepre  pI have no problem sending data back and forth. The problem that I do have is that when I try to restart Activity A, it goes through the Activitys codeonCreatecode method. I prefer not to do this because I want to be able to set up everything beforehand in the codeonCreatecode method, then supplement what is already in there through the codeonRestartcode method. Im not exactly sure why the codeonCreatecode method is being called every time I restart the activity. My guess is the way I call the activity in Activity Bp  precodeIntent intent  new Intentthis, PatientChartActivity.class intent.putExtrachecked, checked intent.putStringArrayListExtrachecked, checked startActivityintent codepre  pI have been looking at the Android activity lifecycle and Im not sure why it is not automatically returning to the previous activity, unless I do indeed have to force it do do so. One thing that I am sure of is the the activity that is running is not being destroyed. I put in a codeLog.vTAG, DESTROYcode log message in the codeonDestroycode method ensuring it doesnt destroy the activity. I have tried using different flags when I start the activity to tell the system that I want to restore a previously started activity, but those dont seem to work either. I may misunderstand them. I have researched exstensiveley on the topic but none of the solutions I found have helped. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7293820howtoopenalreadyopenedactivityinsteadofcreatingnewoneHerea is an issue that I found that seems to be identical to mine but didnt seem to solve what I was looking for.

Negative 8125 pIn Cocoa, when we want to redraw a view, we would send the view a codesetNeedsDisplaycode message telling the view to redraw itself with a parameter of YES.  I was wondering if there are any circumstances where you would want to send a view codesetNeedsDisplayNOcode, such as multithreading environments, and if sending a view a codesetNeedsDisplayYEScode, then setting it again immediately after with codesetNeedsDisplayNOcode would make the view redraw itself.  If there are no reasons to call codesetNeedsDisplayNOcode, then why create such a tedious method, where they could instead implement something like code[view redrawView]codep
Negative 8125 pI am comparing JSON and BSON for serializing objects. These objects contain several arrays of a large number of integers. In my test the object I am serializing contain a total number of about 12.000 integers. I am only interested in how the sizes compare of the serialized results.

And if I disable the prescaler the HRESET signal asserted even before even betwen first modification of the SWSR register very short time. Thus, it seems the Timer in some way responds to the setting changes, but it is something wrong with the timing.p  pThe System Clock and PhaseLock Loop supposed to be configured correctly because we get same configuration on already established and running application on top of VxWorks, but with the Watchdog Timer turned off.p  pAlso I tried to clear SWF bit in SYPCR register to prevent the Timer counting while JTAG stopped the cpu by asserting FRZ signal then it works only until I exit from breakstepping mode, when I run an application the reset occurs in a very short time.p  pAccording to the Reference Manual the Timer works in the following wayp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKXpuz.png altMPC885 Software Watchdog Timer diargramp  pThere is a downcounter, when it reaches zero the circuit asserts HRESET signal or raises a System Reset Interrupt. The counter is two bytes long optionally prescaled by a factor of 2048. It is decremented at rate of System Clock divided by 2048. So the expected timeout with the prescaler enabled and maximum counter value is code1  80MHz  2048  65535  2048code which is about of 3435 seconds. With the prescaler disabled it should be about 1.7 seconds. Actual values are far smaller about 0.5 seconds with the prescaled counter and much smaller cant even measure with the prescaler turned off.p  pAccording to the Diagram the SWT depends only on Core Clock and the SYPCR register, here is the register descriptionp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4pT5W.png altMPC885 System Protection Control Register  diagram img srchttpi.stack.imgur.commtHLo.png altMPC885 System Protection Control Register  fields descriptionsp  pI set the value 0xFFFFFF87 actually tried different options, which meansp  ul liSWTC 0xFFFF Timer Count, the maximum value is loaded into the internal downcounter see diagram upon writing magic sequence to the SWSR register.li liBMT 0XFF Bus Monitor Timer Count, the maximum valueli liBME 1 Bus Monitor enabled, and there is no sence to turn the bit off because it is always enabled with JTAG regardless of the configured value.li liSWF 0 the timer counts even when JTAG asserts FRZ signal.li liSWE 1 Watchdog is Enabled.li liSWRI 1 configured to assert HRESET, switching to NMI didnt helped.li liSWP 1 SWTC is prescaled by a factor of 2048.li ul  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 8125 pI have a scenario where I list products in a page and allow users to edit products properties only in a modal window. p  pWhen a user clicks on the product and start editing the products properties, changes gets propagated right away to the product in the product list page and any part of page bound directly or indirectly to the property undergoing the changes. Not the desired behaviour. Changes should be propagated  only when the user confirms the changes i.e save button clicked, transaction committed and modal window closed p  precodetransaction APP.store.transaction,  renderTemplatefunctioncontroller, record      this.transaction.addrecord      append the modal view     App.ModalView.create.append         ,  onSaveClick functionrecord      this.transaction.commit     this.transitionToproducts ,   codepre  pIdeally i need to instruct Ember to stop propagating any changes on the product until the transaction is committed.

I need a way to keep changes away from the store as long as the item is uncommitted as reflected by its currentStatep  pUsing the item status isDirty doesnt help to solve this problem because when its used the item is completely removed from the list and thats not acceptable.p  precode  each item in controller    unless item.isDirty      item.name    unless codepre

But that doesnt happen.

Negative 8125 pI am trying to understand how SSH authorization method work because I am trying to setup an git server using gitolite.p  pAs far as I know gitolite will use the ssh to authorize users and give access to them to a specific repository with personal write and read permissions. But I am confused about how the authorization will work.p  pIve watched some videos in YouTube and they use some analogy with colors to explain. If I understand right, for two persons that are going to communicate between each other in a secret way, they need a secret and public key.p  pThe two persons know each other public keys, and to communicate between each other they agree to use one public key. To establish a connection they encrypt they private key using the same public key and send the result to each other. When they receive the result they add the private key to that message and like magic they got the same message.p  pBut I dont think I understand this right because I cant see how the server will verify the the client. I know the server had to hold the public keys from the clients that will connect to him, but he also got a private keyp  pWhen the client tries to connect to a server, he sends his private key encrypted with his public key, and the server encrypt his private key using the client public key and send to the clientp  pHow the server check if the user is really him I also read that to decrypt the information encrypted with a public key, only the person that holds the private key can decrypt the message. So how the server can decrypt the message send by the client if he dont have the client private keyp  pIf someone could explain me how the authentication, authorization, and exchange of information work using this public and private keys I would be very happy.p

Negative 8125 pIm writing some software that automates data gathering from experiments, and needed some help expressing the relationship between my business objects.p  pI have a type called codeExperimentcode, a type called codeSamplecode, and an unimplemented codeRunOnSamplecode method in codeExperimentcode that should accept a derivative of the codeSamplecode type and fill data into itp  precodePublic MustInherit Class Experiment     Public Property TestDate As Date     Public Property Experimenter As String      Public MustOverride Sub RunOnSamplesample As Sample End Class  Public MustInherit Class Sample     Public Property UnitLotCode As String End Class codepre  pNeither of these types are actually instantiable, since I have different experiments represented by subtypes of codeExperimentcode that generate various kinds of data. Each experiment has a matching subtype of codeSamplecode that has properties to store the data generated by the experiment. Note that the base classes are necessary, since there are some properties common to all experiments, and some data that will be recorded for all samples.p  pFor example, a codeThicknessExperimentcode measures thickness data and scans a lot code, then fills this data out into a codeThicknessSamplecodep  precodePublic Class ThicknessExperiment     Public Overrides Sub RunOnSamplesample As ThicknessSample         Dim data  GetDataFromMeasurementDevice          sample.UnitLotCode  data.LotCode         sample.Thickness  data.Thickness     End Sub End Class  Public MustInherit Class ThicknessSample     Public Property Thickness As Single End Class codepre  pThe problem here is that the type of the parameter is unacceptable to the compiler the implementation of codeRunOnSamplecode must accept codeSamplecode, and not codeThicknessSamplecode or any other subtype of codeSamplecode. Presumably this is because, had the compiler let me have my way, the derived experiment would no longer have the same interface as the parent class, which would be unpolymorphic.p  pThe only way I can think of to approach this problem is to cast the argument to the appropriate subtype of codeSamplecode inside the method before using it. Is there a better way to implement what I am going for Preferably an approach that maintains the strongly typed association of a codeXYZExperiment.RunOnSamplecode method to a codeXYZSamplecode argumentp
Negative 8125 pI am looking for a way to merge the content of two pdf pages. It could be a watermark, an image or whatever.p  pThe scenario is as follows I have a Wordaddin that allows the user to create different templates for different customers based on several template forms. For each new customer, the user can provide a new letter paper containing header image  logos and footer. This shall be applied anyhow at runtime. Could be an image that is loaded directly into the header of the template then I would need to render pdf to image, for the letter paper will mostly be provided as pdffile or when exporting the document merging letter paper as background.p  pBut the template shall not be accessible by the user, so this must be done programmatically.p  pSo far, I tried Pdfsharp library, which does not support neither the version of my provided backpapers, nor the version of my documents created in Word 2007. iTextSharp seemed very promising, but I could not manage to merge the contents so far. I also tried pdftk.exe, but even when i ran it manually from command line, I got the error Done. Input errors, so no output created.p  pIt does not matter how it is handled, but the output matters.p  pI forgot to mention, there is a whiteline created in the Wordtemplate for archiving purposes, so this part may not be added as image or it has to be added afterwords into the output document.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8125 pI have a class that contains functions that need to run as threads. The proper way to do this form what I understand is have these functions declared as static. To use methods from this class I need a to have an instance to that class, so I create a static variable that is initialized to self in the constructor. What are the implications in efficiency and program logicp  precodeclass Foo     private Foo thisinstance    Foo           thisinstancethis         void FooBar        ...         static void Bar        if thisinstanceNULL return 1 throws are not catched are they    thisinstancegtFooBar    return 0      codepre  pNot actual code but to make my question clearer.p  pThe application actually works and I checked it with helgrindmemcheck and the errors are not related to the issue at hand. Im asking this question because all solutions seem like workarounds, including this one.

At the moment Im using a load of if statements to return the desired object or form based on parameters Im giving it, which gets a bit tricky when different forms need specifying and whether they need an instance or not. Although this seems to be far from the most efficient way of achieving this.p  pDjango seems to have functions to cover most repetitive tasks, is there some magic Im missing herep  pedit  Heres an example of what Im doing with the arguments Im passing into the urlp  precodedef editobjectrequest, object, id     ifobjectcar         form  carForminstance  Car.objects.getpkid     return renderrequest, template.html, formform codepre

Negative 8125 pI am upgrading my app from iOS6 to iOS7 and I am having some issues with my UIViewControllers layout.  In iOS6 I was able to resize my UITextViews dynamically by getting the contentSize property of the textView and then setting its frame property.  I would do all the resizing in the viewWillAppear method so that way the view would be resized before it was visible.  Now in iOS7 it doesnt work. The only way the contentSize property works is if I set in the viewDidAppear method. I hate doing that because it causes the view to jump after its already visible. Has anyone figured out how to solve this problemp  pHere is my code that no longer works in iOS7p  precodevoidviewWillAppearBOOLanimated      self.textView  [[UITextView alloc]initWithFrameCGRectMake5, 0, 310, 0]     self.textView.text  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Amazon Redshift stores columnar data in 1 MB disk blocks. emThe min and max values for each block are stored as part of the metadata. If a rangerestricted column is a sort key, the query processor is able to use the min and max values to rapidly skip over large numbers of blocks during table scans. For example, if a table stores five years of data sorted by date and a query specifies a date range of one month, up to 98 of the disk blocks can be eliminated from the scan. If the data is not sorted, more of the disk blocks possibly all of them have to be scanned. For more information about these optimizations, see Choosing distribution keys.emp  pSecondary questionsbr What is the complexity of the aforementioned skipping scan on a sort key Is it linear  On  or some variant of binary search  Ologn br If a key is sorted  is skipping the only optimization availablebr What would this skipping optimization look like in the explain planbr Is the above explain the best one possible for this querybr What is the fastest result redshift can be expected to provide given this scenariobr Does vanilla ParAccel have different behavior in this use casep

Negative 8125 pI need to do a runtime stack analysis on embedded hardware to ensure Ive allocated enough stack space. I understand the basic theory. On boot, you initialize the stack with a known pattern such as all 0xFF or 0xAA, then allow your program to run. As it runs the stack grows and shrinks but it never restores the original pattern. After a sufficiently long enough period, examine the stack and find the address of the last stack value to be altered.p  pI do not need a portable solution, just a solution for the dsPIC33EP512MU810 and PIC32MX795F512. My fallback plan is to incrementally decrease the stack size until I get a stack strongoverflowstrong, but that only works once I have a release candidate, Id much prefer a solution that continually monitors throughout development and production.p

Negative 8125 pIm trying to implement a class that isolates a part of a object, and replaces the part with with something else.

Negative 8125 pshort summary at the bottomp  pHello,p  pIm writing a tool in Java thats used to examine a binary file. Due to the format of the data, I cant parse the file in a linear way. Instead, I have to jump a lot through the entire file. While examining it, Im filling a data structure that annotates each offset in the file with the required information. All the annotations are strings. Some should have a different color and an ability to interact with them, e.g. right clicking with custom actions depending on the type.p  pSo basically, Im parsing the file into a maplike structure, adding nodes and leaves at nonpredictable locations. I want to display the contents as linear text, sorted by the offset in the binary file. The user should be able to work with the parsed content while other parts of the file are still being parsed, so waiting for the parsing to be done and then doing a linear insert is not an option. The user will never change any part of the text, so I dont need undoactions etc.p  pIve looked at Swings Text API, some of the features I need seem to be present there, e.g. using different View objects to be able to interact with some of the texts. However, Ive looked at the source and it seems that Swing Documents have an underlying Content class that store the entire text. While memory is not a concern, Im worried about the performance of inserting the text at random locations while parsing the document. The GapContent class which is the default implementation of a Documents Content interface is suited for multiple edits at the same location, so inserts at random positions would cause a lot of array copies to happen.p  pI thought about other options, but since Ive never used Swings text API before, I need some advice whether any of the ideas is goodp  pa Implementing AbstractDocument.Content myself. The problem would be that Swing uses offsets in a virtual text file, so Id have to remember which offset in Swings world belongs to which node in my structure. Changing the structure while parsing will make this approach rather complex.p  pb Implementing the whole Document interface myself.

Does the client also must be unblocking What are all requirements for selectp  pThe things I did on my server program to be multiclientp  p1 I set my socket option for reuse address, with SOREUSEADDRp  p2 and set my server as nonblocking mode with ONONBLOCK using fctl.p  p3 and put the timeout argument as zero.p  pand proper use of FDfunctions after above.p  pBut when I run my client program one and many more, from the second client, client program blocks, not getting accepted by server.p  pI guess the reason is because I put my server programs main function part  into the recv was 0  case.p  pfor example with my server code,p  pIm using temp and read as fdset, and read as master in this casep  precodeint mainvoid     int connsock, listensock   struct sockaddrin saddr, caddr   int rq, ack   char path[100]   int pre, change, c   int conn, pagenum, x   int clen  sizeofcaddr   int fd   int flags   int opt  1   int nbytes   fdset read, temp    if listensock  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, IPPROTOTCP lt 0        perrorsocket error     return 1       memsetampsaddr, 0, sizeofsaddr    saddr.sinfamily  AFINET   saddr.sinaddr.saddr  htonlINADDRANY   saddr.sinport  htons3500   if setsockoptlistensock, SOLSOCKET, SOREUSEADDR, ampopt, sizeofint  1         perrorServersetsockopt error      exit1       flags  fcntllistensock, FGETFL, 0   fcntllistensock, FSETFL, flags  ONONBLOCK    fcntllistensock, FSETOWN, getpid    bindlistensock, struct sockaddr ampsaddr, sizeofsaddr    listenlistensock, 8    FDZEROampread   FDZEROamptemp    FDSETlistensock, ampread   while 1         temp  read      if selectFDSETSIZE, amptemp, fdset  0, fdset  0,         struct timeval  0 lt 1            perrorselect error       exit1           for fd  0 fd lt FDSETSIZE fd            CHECK all file descriptors        if FDISSETfd, amptemp                 if fd  listensock                     connsock  acceptlistensock, struct sockaddr  ampcaddr, ampclen           FDSETconnsock, ampread           printfnew client got session dn, connsock                   else                     nbytes  recvfd, ampconn, 4, 0           if nbytes lt 0                        closefd             FDCLRfd, ampread                      else                         if conn  SessionRq                             ack  SessionAck               sendfd, ampack, sizeofack, 0                rootsetting                c  0               while 1                                c                 printfin while loopn                 recvfd, amppagenum, 4, 0                  if c gt 1                                    change  comparewithprepagepre, pagenum                    if change  1                                        pagestack[stackcount]  pagenum                     stackcount                                      else                                        printfsame as before pagen                                     end of if                 else if c  1                                    pagestack[stackcount]  pagenum                   stackcount                                   printfstack countdn, stackcount                 printfin page stack lt                  for x  0 x lt stackcount x                                    printf d , pagestack[x]                                   printfgtn                  rqhandlerfd                  if loggedin  1                                    printfYou are logged in state now, user sn,                       curruser.ID                                  else                                    printfnot logged in.n                   c  0                                   pre  pagenum                end of while              end of if                     end of else        end of fdisset      end of for loop      end of outermost while  codepre  pif needed for code explanation  What I was about to work of this code was, to make kind of web pages to implement browser for server.

Negative 8125 pI have a line object and each line object has an array of tasks associated with it.Each task has a start time and an end time.Each task also has a list of tasks which are its predecessors.p  pstrongSo if all the tasks were independent no predecessors I would just calculate the end time of the last task on each line which would be the end time of this line.The time taken by the production would be the maximum of the end time of all lines.strongp  pThe problem is a task could be dependent on a task which could be on the same or a different line.

Negative 8125 pI believe my problem can be considered regardless of used language but, to have some anchor, Ill describe it using the Java language.p  pLets consider the following scenario I have a class strongPickyHoststrong extending Thread and an instance of it, strongpickyHostInststrong running. That class might look like thisp  precodeclass PickyHost extends Thread      private ArrayListltGuestgt guests     public void enterGuest g           deal with g          private void pickGuests           ...          public void run           listen indefinitely       codepre  pMoreover, in the background, I have many strongGueststrong instances running they also extend strongThreadstrong class and once in a while, some stronggueststrong wants to invoke strongenterstrong method on strongpickyHostInststrong with an argument stronggstrong being itself. Now, I want strongPickyHoststrong to be picky in the following sensep  pImmediately after someone invokes strongenterstrong method, it puts stronggstrong at the end of strongguestsstrong list and forces stronggstrong to wait for notification. Also I think here lies the crux of the matter it goes itself for a 5 seconds sleep and somehow allows during these 5 seconds other guests to invoke strongenterstrong method if so happens, then it forgets about how long it had to sleep and resets its alarm clock to sleep exactly 5 seconds again  Ill call it a emsensitive sleepem.p  pAs you can see, the total amount of time strongpickyHostInststrong sleeps can be huge if many guests arrive  like A arrives, then after 4 seconds B arrives, then after another 4 seconds C arrives and so on. However, suppose theres been created a chain A, B, ..., G of guests and from the moment of arrival of G till 5 seconds later, noone arrived. Then I want strongpickyHostInststrong to invoke strongpickGuestsstrong method which, using some algorithm, determines a strongsubsetstrong S of A, B, ..., G of guests to notify that they can stop waiting and carry on doing what they normally do and moreover removes elements of S from strongguestsstrong list. Method strongpickGuestsstrong can take some time to accomplish and in the meantime some guest H might have arrived and invoked strongenterstrong  then strongenterstrong should proceed normally but strongpickGuestsstrong should ignore H and to the end of its last invocation deal with A, B, ..., G  not with A, B, ..., G, H. After finishing strongpickGuestsstrong, strongpickyHostInststrong should here I have 2 ideas  implementing any of them will make me happy  eitherp  ol lifall again into 5 seconds of emsensitive sleepem after which, if no guest after H arrived, invoke strongpickGuestsstrong again, orli lisimultaneously serves guests via strongenterstrong method as usual but invokes strongpickGuestsstrong only after maxa moment when last guest from S from the last invocation notifies strongpickyHostInststrong like the last Thank you, Mr Host from among S, a moment 5 seconds after the last newest guest invoked strongenterstrong.li ol  pFinally, after a long introduction, my question  which tools do I need to accomplish such task Im unfortunately a bit lost among the richness of various locks and multithreadinglocking mechanisms and cant discern which one fits to my problem or which ones, combined somehow.p  pIll greatly appreciate some codesketches that would put me on the right track.p

Negative 8125 pWe have a webapp which uses federated authentication to authenticate users. Data for the Fed Auth are obtained from the Active Directory service.p  pOne of the systems requirements is to have a Last log in date saved in the webapp, but the application is not performing any log in operation. It just checks if the incoming request if allowed to perform requested operation, based on the AD credentials.p  pHave you ever encountered such a requirement in a similar scenario What was your approach to the problem We thought about creating user session on the first request and treat the session creation point as the log in date. This seemed as a bad idea, as we dont want to use usersession at all, and it would be the only scenario utilizing it.p  pAnother approach we were thinking about was to use client to tell us if he is logging in or not, for example by making a special mock request, which on the webapp would be treated as the log in. This also seems bad, because in that case we have to trust the client to be telling the truth, which basically looks like a major vulnerability.p  pI am aware that this requirement makes little sense in such environment, but that is something I cant argue with right now, thats why I am trying to find most reasonable solution to that situation.p  pThanks for all the suggestions in advance.p

Negative 8125 pIm trying to find a suitable inheritance configuration for the following problemp  pMy base class is an Agent Class which has 3 abstract methodsp  precodeclass Agent metaclass  abc.ABCMeta      def initself      abc.abstractmethod     def biddingcurveself      abc.abstractmethod     def evaluatebiddingcurveself      abc.abstractmethod     def actionself codepre  pAn agent can either be simulated using an executable dymo or using an FMU a zip file of Csource code. So I created 2 different types of Agents that inherit from the base Agent and implement their way of communicating with the simulation. Here is the implementation of the dymo simulation environment but the same goes for the FMU.p  precodeclass DymoAgentAgent     def initself, power, dymo                   Agent based on the dymosim simulation environment.         param dymo The dymo that needs to be run                    superDymoAgent, self.init          self.dymo  dymo      def biddingcurveself         pass      def evaluatebiddingcurveself, priority         pass      def actionself, priority         self.dymo.action codepre  pThe DymoAgent and the FMUAgent determine how my Agent will interact with the simulation environment.p  pNext I need an implementation of the Agent to determine how the Agent will interact with an application. However, I want this interaction to be independent of the simulation environment. E.g. I want to create an agent that can communicate with a Heater application and implements the logic to do so.p  precodeclass HeaterWhatAgentShouldIUseHere     pass codepre  pI want this Heater class to implement the abstract methods from the Agent baseclass and the implementation of a Dymo or FMUAgent so it knows how to interact with the simulation. But I dont want to write 2 Heater classes with the same logic and thus basically the same code inheriting from the different simulation Agents. I summarized the question in this imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrY1ph.png altenter image description herep  pIs there a way to use inheritance to prevent thisp  pArnout p

Negative 8125 pEF is so widely used staff but I dont realize how I should use it. I met a lot of issues with ef on different projects with different approaches. So some questions brought together in my head. And answers leads me to use pure ado.net with stored procedures.  So the questions arep  ol liHow to deal with EF in ntier application For example, we have some DAL with EF. I saw a lot of articles and projects that used repository, unitofwork patterns as some kind of abstraction for EF. I think such approach kills most of benefits that increase development speed and leads to  few things  ul liremapping of EF load results in some DTO that kills performancecall some select to get table data  first loop, second loop  map results to some composite type generated by ef, next  filter mapped data using linq and, at last, map it to some DTO. Exactly remapping to DTO is killer of one of the biggest efs benefitbr strongorstrongli lileads to strong cohesions between EF and its strongversionstrong and app. It will be something like 2tier app with dal and presentation with bll or dal with bll and presentation. I guess its not best practice. And the same loading process as we have for previous thing except mapping, so again performance issue raised up. We could try to use EF as DAL without any abstraction under them. But we will get similar issues in some other way.  li ulli lipShould I use one context per appthreadatomic operation Using approach  one context per appthread may slightly increase performance and possibilities to call navigation properties, but we meet another problem  updating this context and growing loaded data in context, also Im not sure about concurrency with one dbcontext per appthread. Using context per operation will lead us to remapping ef results to our DTOs. So you see that we again pushed back to question no.1.pli lipCould we try to use EF  SPs only Again we have issues from previous questions. What is the reason to use ef if the biggest part of functionality will not be used  pli ol  pSo, yes EF is great to start project. It so convenient when we have few screens and crud operations.  But what next p  pAll this text is just unsorted thoughts. I know that pure ado.net will lead to another kind of challenges.  So, what is your opinion about this topicp

Negative 8125 pWhen using the accordion from Zurbs Foundation 5, it makes the scroll bar jump when the class of active is applied to show the content.

Negative 8125 pIm attempting to use LeafletJS with requireJS and some LeafletJS plugins. I know that if you are using files that arent AMD modules, you need to shim them in the config. Does this mean I will have to shim each individual plugin with the LeafletJS dependency Exp  precoderequire.config     paths          leaflet         vendorleafletleafletjs,         leafletplugin1         vendorleafletleafletplugin1,         leafletplugin2         vendorleafletleafletplugin2     ,     shim          leafletplugin1              deps leaflet         ,         leafletplugin2              deps leaflet                codepre  pThe problem is that I plan to have many libraries with many plugins, and this config will get extremely long since I have to not only shim each individual plugin but also provide a path for each. Is there a simpler way to do this It would be nice if I could even define a require.config inside of a module for use only with that module, that way I could keep my project better organized and less cluttered.p  pAlso, there is no other way to simply coderequire[leafletplugin1], functioncode without shimming it, correctp  pEDIT Just to clarify, this doesnt have to be a LeafletJSspecific questionanswer. This is just the current example Im working with. p

The behavior is the same.             httpClient.Timeout  TimeSpan.FromMillisecondstimeout             var cts  new CancellationTokenSource             cts.CancelAftertimeout              var content  ...             var responseMessage  await httpClient.PostAsyncEndpoint, content, cts.Token.ConfigureAwaitfalse             if responseMessage.IsSuccessStatusCode                              var contentData  await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync.ConfigureAwaitfalse                 ...                 return ...                          ...                                catch OperationCanceledException ex               Log statement ...          catch Exception ex               Log statement ...          return ...  codepre  pstrongThe Symptomsstrongp  pThis code works great on my local machine, and it works fine on our test servers most of the time.  However, occasionally we get a bunch of mass recorded timeouts  recorded by the Record timing comments above and the Log statements on OperationCanceledExceptions.  I do not have any way of telling if the services I call actually timed out.p  pNow, when I say a series of timeouts I mean that most or all of the tasks and the HttpClients that all but one use, the other uses a WCF service all timeout at about the same time.p  pNow, I know what you are thinking, I am passing in the same timeout.  Thats right, but I pass in 250 ms and the run time that is being reported by the various stop watches are around 800 ms or higher.p  pNow, I do see the OperationCanceledExceptions in the log, but the time stamp of the exception is the same as the time stamp of when the stopwatch ended or within 23 ms and my service is failing because clients are expecting it to respond in 500 ms or less, not 800 ms.p  pNow, normally the various services respond in less than 100 ms, with a wide variance among the results.  When we a problem occurs, and most  all return in 800 ms or more, they vary  only by 10 ms.  The dependencies I call are all on different domains.  It seems highly unlikely that all of them are really taking that long to respond, all at the same time.p  pI suppose there could be a network issue, affecting all requests at the same time, but the other services in our network do not experience the same behavior  it is limited to the new service I am writing.p  pEven if that was the case, I would expect the cancellation exceptions to occur after 250 ms, then for the task to end and the stopwatch to record 250 plus 520ms or so for exception handling.p  pSo I do not think that it is a network issue.  Now I am sure that at least part of the problem is related to me not cancelling  timing out correctly, but it seem to me that all of the out going requests from the service are being affected at the same time independent of HttpClient.p  pThe reason I say that is because the WCF service also shows 800 ms according to the stopwatch when the rest of the requests timeout.  The WCF service is not asynchronous.  The timeout is set like thisp  precodevar binding  new BasicHttpBinding      Security  new BasicHttpSecurity              Mode  BasicHttpSecurityMode.TransportCredentialOnly,         Transport  new HttpTransportSecurity                      ClientCredentialType  HttpClientCredentialType.Ntlm               ,     ReceiveTimeout  TimeSpan.FromMillisecondstimeout  codepre  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pSo, in short I think that something is causing all outgoing requests to any domain to pause or queue which is causing the observed behavior.p  pI have spent days trying to figure out what is going on, but have had no luck.  Any ideasp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI think what is happening is that the requests are being put put on hold because there isnt a thread available, and then a few hundred milliseconds later a thread is available and the task starts.  Timing the  method call shows that it is taking 800 ms, but the timeout on the HttpClient doesnt start until a thread is available to run the async call.p  pIt would also explain why I see that the method takes 800 ms, but sometimes it still completes without showing a timeout exception.  Other times it does throw a timeout exception and does not complete.p  pI have tried setting the ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit to 200 in ApplicationStart, but that did not solve the issue.p  pThe service isnt taking that much traffic compared to our other services, and none of the others appear to have the same problem.p  pAny ideasp  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pI logged into the box and monitored netstat while doing minor load tests.p  pUsing HttpClient, with 12 requests per second the ports would show ESTABLISHED, then move to TIMEWAIT for about 4 minutes.  With 3 requests per second I would end up with about a constant 100 x requests per second ESTABLISHED ports so 300 for a 3 per second load test, and then I would start seeing them go to CLOSEWAIT instead of TIMEWAIT  indicating an error condition on close.  At the same time I would see the spike in the number of exceptions and time to execute the requests. TcpTimedWaitDelay does not apply to CLOSEWAIT.p  pSo I rewrote the whole thing to use HttpWebRequests in serial, instead of HttpClient in parallel.  Then I ran the same tests.p  pNow the ESTABLISHED ports equal 02 x requests per second, and the ports then move on to TIMECLOSE as expected.  The performance and throughput improved, but didnt clear up completely.p  pThen I set TcpTimedWaitDelay to 30 default 240.  The performance has increased dramatically.  I have a primitive load test that hits it with 40 requests per second without any issues.  I will get a more thorough test setup but I think the problem has been solved.p  pI dont know what is going on, but it appears that the HttpClient was not closing the ephemoral ports correctly underneath.  Many of the developers and architects at my company looked at it and couldnt not see anything wrong with the code.  I tried having a single HttpClient in a using statement per request, as well as having a single HttpClient per api I call on the back end.  I have tried using HttpClient in parallel and serial.  I have tried it with asyncawait and without.  No matter what I tried the behavior was the same.p  pI would like to be able to use HttpClient, but I cant spend anymore time on this issue as I have it working with HttpWebRequest.  My next step is to make the HttpWebRequests occur in Parallel.p  pThank you for your input.p

Negative 8125 pI would like to get an opinion of what would be the best approach how to tackle my problem.

And i want to keep the structure there as it is, because then it is a flexible fully GUI independent solution. Just to explain my reason behind this further  the data structure represents a physical memory of an external hardware unit MCU.p  pAfter that I need to split up that data into properties. Meaning that I have several properties that are bound to elements in GUI giving them data. Thus I want each property take data from specific region in array as example index 100104.p  pThe problematic part for me is how to bind these properties to the array in the mentioned way The binding needs to be two way.p

Negative 8125 pIm having trouble with a Rails app that I inherited and I have no experience with Rails. It uses JBuilder to return a JSON response from a MySQL database.

Negative 8125 pIve come across a couple use cases recently where Ive wanted to create and associate reference items inplace. Please identify how I can achieve a create and associate pattern with the dexterity framework.p  pThe create and associate pattern would allow an end user to create a new item and use that new item as a reference in the context of the current item. Most importantly, the user should never feel that they have fully left the context of the current item or they should be immediately returned to that context.p  pIll use a concrete example.

Negative 8125 p[In order to open the example urls you need to login to Shazam]p  pSo Im writing a script that downloads my Shazam history so I can then manipulate it to write playlists to other services. Anyways, I cant directly parse the history from a hrefhttpwww.shazam.commyshazam relnofollowhttpwww.shazam.commyshazama because theres a lot of JavaScript reloading going on there and I guess it would be harder to solve that problem.  So thats why I want to manipulate the file you can download which you can find here a hrefhttpwww.shazam.commyshazamdownloadhistory relnofollowhttpwww.shazam.commyshazamdownloadhistoryap  pIm trying to find a way to do this but Im running with some problems here.p  p1st I was planning to use urlretrievep  precodeimport urllib urllib.urlretrieve httpwww.shazam.commyshazamdownloadhistory, myshazamhistory.html codepre  pbut Im not even sure thats going to work at all because when I try to download that file theres not an actual URL path like a hrefhttpwww.shazam.commyshazamdownloadhistorymyshazamhistory.html relnofollowhttpwww.shazam.commyshazamdownloadhistorymyshazamhistory.htmla that gives you a 404 error. Instead when you hit that URL it immediately redirects to a hrefhttpwww.shazam.com relnofollowhttpwww.shazam.coma and it prompts the download window of the browser.p  pThe 2nd problem is that I still need to hold the cookies of the sessions and I dont know how to pass that to urlretrieve to test if it works. Below there is a test code I wrote that is logging in, holding the session and then parse a webpage.p  precodedef LoginFBusername,password    opener  urllib2.buildopenerurllib2.HTTPCookieProcessorcookielib.CookieJar    url  httpswww.facebook.comlogin.phpskipapilo....alltheloginshazamstuff    data  ampemailusernameamppasspassword    socket  opener.openurl    return socket, opener  def shazamParseopener    url  httpwww.shazam.commyshazam    content  opener.openurl.read    soup  BeautifulSoupcontent    finalParse  soup.prettify    return finalParse.encodeutf8  socket, opener  LoginFBemail,password  shazamParseopener     codepre  pWhat I want to do is hit the download url as a logged userholding the session cookies, download the file into the memory, put the contents of the file into a string and then parse it with BeautifulSoup. Exactly the same approach as my shazamParse function only that Im reading from a string with the contents of the strongmyshazamhistory.htmlstrong file.p  pAny ideas or hints on how can I do thisp

Negative 8125 pIm using a Kendo grid to display an inline editable list of events inside of an AngularJS directive.  The data is loading and displaying as expected and everything seems to be working correctly.

Negative 8125 pI understand the format of stackoverflow questions. My question is a little broad maybe, but I need help regarding what approach to use, I have done my research and things are getting confusing by day. Any help will be appreciated.p  pI have a web applicationjava, springs framework, spring social, also facebook JS sdk on UI for login screens that has two type of users strongtype 1strong and strongtype 2strong. Type 1 users are sort of like producers of content and Type 2 consumers. type 1 users can visit a type 2 profile and consume their content.p  pNow whenever a type 1 user consumes content from type 2, I want to publish that activityas a story or a post on a facebook page owned by the type 2 user on behalf of either my application or a facebook user owned by me, who would have liked the type 2 users pagep  pI am trying to find the best approach or mode to do a thing like this for my application.p  pInitially open graph looked promising until, I found out that it is not possible to post OG story on a facebook page.p  pThe problems that I am not very clear aboutp  ol lipIs it possible to post on behalf of an application to a facebook page that is liked by the admin of the facbeook application pli lipAnother approach, I could think of was at time of type 2 registration, I ask them to link their account with facebook and provide page id that they want content posted to. At this moment, I fetch and store in database their access token long term and later post to their pages using their access tokenspli ol  pstrongIssues that I have herestrong Their access token will expire eventually, in at most 60 days, now how to renew that because, I am not expecting them to login even ever again in worst case. But I want to be able to post content whenever a type 1 interacts with a type 2.p  ol start3 liThe third case, post on behalf of a my facebook useri have username and password who owns the application and also has liked the facebook page of type 2. In here, Is it possible to get the access token for my user using spring social facebook on server side. I could run job on server side to exchange this token for a new one when the current token is about to expire.li ol  pAlso, I feel that this should not be a unique case. So, could you share experience on which approach would be best followed in such a casesort of like the standard case, who should post on whose wall. I just want to show the activity appear on type 2 users facebook page that name of type 1 user consumed content on my application.p
Negative 8125 pWe have a system where we crawl some URLs of specific interest using nutch, store the crawled content on HDFS and then categorize the content based on a predefined set of taxonomiesVocabularies and terms.

Therefore the values are unknown during compile time. Depending on the designed filter it can happen that some coefficients are 1.0 or 0.0. Therefore the corresponding operation can be omitted. This will save a lot performance. For sure I can now optimize the code to be fast for one dedicated filter but as mentioned the implementation shall be very generic. My first idea was some kind of self modifiying algorithm...but maybe someone has a cool idea or hint...  p

Negative 8125 pI am programming a simple Top Down Shooter right now. The player is able to hold the down mouse to continously shoot. Since there is no native way to check if the mouse button is held down I implemented this solution a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma68289903716866httpstackoverflow.coma68289903716866ap  pThis works perfectly fine. But the problem is that I put each bullet object and each GameObject enemies, player, barrels, etc. in a Linked List two lists one for the objects, one for the bullets. When you shoot a bullet it gets added to the LinkedList. Each runthrough of the gameloop the whole List gets checked through for collision. After firing about 2 shots the game crashes with a Null Pointer Exception. I think the problem is, since I use a second thread to implement the mouse button hold down, that a bullet object is getting created while in the other thread it checks through the list. Since I am checking through the list, while the size is getting altered it is checking through the list, it crashes. But that is just my theory.

Negative 8125 pMade some changes to a project today, but when I went to archive it for release I suddenly get a duplicate interface definition for one of the pods. It built just fine a few days ago, and builds and runs just fine on the simulator, but once I try to archive it throws up the error.p  pIts complaining about duplicate interface definition for the Pop pod. Its not a static library as far as I can tell which the Cocoapods page lists as a cause for this problem, so what might be wrong herep  pIve tried to clean the build folder, but it doesnt seem to help. I havent changed anything in the pod, just in my own project. The duplicate definitions its complaining about is from the header file in the pod, and from the header file in Cocoapods HeadersBuild folder.p

Negative 8125 pbackground Im currently setting up a website using bootstrap. First thing I found is that in bootstrap the Panel Accordion does only toggle if you click exactly at the link. after swaping the h4 and a tag there was still some places where i can click on the panel without toggling.p  pto fix this i moved the toggle element to the containing div. Now it doesnt matter where on the title Panel I click it will be toggled.p  pAs I wanted the Panel also to be useable with Screenreaders and Keyboard Navigation i ran into the Problem that in the constellation ive set up, the link looses focus when using it by keyboard. when giving the href attribute the value , the page is scrolled to top, thats neither what i wanted.p  pSo I came up with the idea of setting an unused id as target of href. This worked quiet well, the focus is not lost any more.p  pBut Im not sure if this might cause some other troubels.

Negative 8125 pI am studying C programming and making some tests in Ubuntu with Geany.  I have a question about pointers. When an array is declared in a function and then returned as a pointer, array values are lost in the main method. I could check this with a simple example p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  char msg   int mainint argc, char argv      char p  msg     int i     fori0ilt10i         printfi d, value c n, i, p[i]     return 0   char msg      char msg []  hello     return msg   codepre  pThe output is random values excepting the first one that always is h. I suppose that this is because the pointer passed out of the scope and the memory could be written by other functions.p  pBut if the value of message is bigger enough like thousands of characters for example or maybe less, values stand in the same memory place and I can read them despite of the array was created in other function.p  pWhat is the reason for this results p  pThank you so much. p

Negative 8125 pI am developing an agent based model simulating the growth invitro of a cell culture.p  pI am using the MASON library Java, but I guess by question could be applicable to different implementations.p  pEssentially, my agents are programmed to divide every 12  2 timesteps after their creation. Every time an agent divides, a new one is added to the simulation.p  pThis leads to a very rapid growth of the problems complexity, which quickly makes the simulation particularly slow.p  pIn order to solve this problem, I decided agents should die after emtem timesteps from creation.p  pHowever, MASONs schedule is built on a BinaryHeap which does not easily allow the removal objects agents once they have been added. My solution has been to set a boolean flagp  precodedead  false codepre  pWhich is set to true after emtem timesteps.p  pSop  precodeift  50     dead  true codepre  pI then begin my step method, that is the method called each time an agent is stepped, as followsp  precodeifdead     return codepre  pHowever, I understand that simply accessing the object in the schedule is enough to slow the simulation down.p  pDoes anybody have any suggestions as to how I could unset the agent or prevent it from being calledp  pThanks, Dariop

Negative 8125 pI am trying to develop a Dojo DataGrid that returns a users documents from the categorized BidsByDriver view and allows them to edit the Priority field in the grid. After getting past the hurdle of using the strongkeysstrong property to filter over the categoryFilter, this was easy to set up using an xeviewFileItemService readwrite service.  However the problem with  xeviewFileItemService as a data source is it will display empty lines for each entry in the view after showing the users documents in the grid.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDf5xS.jpg altenter image description herep  pTo get around the blank lines I went down the path of creating an xecustomRestService that returned the jasonData for just the current users documents.  This fixes my blank lines problem but my data source is not in the correct readwrite format to support the ingrid editing.p  pHere is the resulting Json data returned form the xecustomRestService ...p  precode[Driverddd,BidID123,Priority1,Trip644,  Driverddd,BidID123,Priority2,Trip444,  Driverddd,BidID123,Priority4,Trip344,  Driverddd,BidID123,Priority4,Trip643 ] codepre  pHere are the Dojo modules I am loadingp  precodeltxpthis.resourcesgt     ltxpdojoModule namedojo.store.JsonRestgtltxpdojoModulegt     ltxpdojoModule namedojo.data.ObjectStoregtltxpdojoModulegt ltxpthis.resourcesgt codepre  pAnd here is the script to develop the data store for the gridp  precodeltxpscriptBlock idscriptBlock2gt       ltxpthis.valuegtlt[CDATA[     var jsonStore  new dojo.store.JsonResttarget InGridCustom.xsppathinfo       var dataStore  dojo.data.ObjectStoreobjectStore jsonStore   ]]gtltxpthis.valuegt ltxpscriptBlockgt codepre  pAll of this works very nicely except for the bit on providing the ingrid editing support.

Negative 8125 pJust wondering if someone can point me in the right direction here for a web2py app. I have 2 controllers so far but I will be using many more. The 2 I have are codeindex.pycode and codediarymanager.pycode.p  pcodeindex.pycode returns an empty dict at the moment and just exposes the codeindex.htmlcode view in the codemyappviewsindexcode directory. Within codeindex.htmlcode the user can click on a button in the interface with the codehrefcode attribute as followsp  precodelta hrefURLcdiarymanager, fdiarymanagergtDiaryltagt codepre  pIf I click that link it will call the codediarymanagercode function in the codediarymanager.pycode controller. All great so far.p  pNow this is where I encounter an issue. If I return a codedictcode from the codediarymanagercode function I have to put the corresponding view in the codemyappviewsdiarymanagercode directory and this will be exposed. On the other hand, if I dont return a dict I cant expose a view at all.p  pSo I have a few questionsp  ol lipWhy do I have to create a directory name matching the controller name in the view when I return a dictpli lipIs there a way to stop this so I can just put all of my views directly into the views directorypli lipHow can I force a controller that does not return a dict to open a specific viewpli ol  pI hope all of that is clearp
Negative 8125 pI know that codeRobolectriccode is intercepting calls to android classes. However I think I need confirmation of understanding the difference between codeemulateSdkcode and codereportSdkcode.p  pFrom java doc I read nextp  precodepublic abstract int emulateSdk The Android SDK level to emulate.  public abstract int reportSdk The Android SDK level to report in Build.VERSION.SDKINT. codepre  pI interpret this as codeemulateSdkcode forces codeRobolectriccode to use classes from specific sdk and emulate behaviour of loading resources or whatever. Where codereportSdkcode is actually how sdk level is visible to calling code basically we mostly use constant to differentiate our code behaviour. p  pSo if I specify codeemulateSdk  14code and codereportSdk  16code then codeRobolectriccode will try to behave as 4.0 API but it will be visible as 4.1 to my code or libraries code.p  pPlease confirm if you know the right answer.p

Negative 8125 pIm making a program that needs to set a static IP to a computers wired NIC, and the program cant perform the next part querying an SNMP string from another IP on the same network until its positively set and usable, which experience has taught me isnt always instant. This program is written in C on VS2013 as a WinForms application, and the function is below. The actual setting of the IP address works perfectly, the problem is trying to poll for when the change completes. I can run the program, have it set an IP address never more than a single IPSubnetGateway, and while its still polling for the change, pop open a command prompt, run ipconfig, and see that the change has already gone through. The program will continue to hang until it times out. I have tried several different methods of querying and checking the IP addresses, including reassigning NICConfig every time through the loop and checking to see if any IP addresses in either string[] match, nothing works. I have not yet piped currentIPs[0] into a file or command line to see what it contains, but I strongly suspect it will contain the previous IP address.  I also tried setting the IP address in the registry, per this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11613196whydoesapplyingastaticipaddressviawmiworkjustonceWhy does applying a static IP address via WMI work just oncea but all that did for me was give me a second IP address on that interface in ipconfig with the program still hanging. p  pActually, on further examination, it looks like the behavior is to add the IP addresssubnetgateway to the list string array, instead of replacing the old info, but the program isnt even getting an updated version of the list with the intended IP on it. This emmayem not have started until after messing with the registry values using code from the above link, I cant be sure. I also cant seem to remove the extra IPs from my PCs configuration, they dont show up in the windows ipv4 configuration page but I do get a warning when closing it about multiple gateways, and removing them from the registry seems to do nothing  so any help fixing my computers NIC configuration would also be appreciated.p  precodeprivate bool setstaticIPstring Index, string[] IP, string[] Subnet, string[] Gateway, string[] DNS      string WMIQuery  String.FormatWin32NetworkAdapterConfiguration.Index0, Index     ManagementObject NICConfig  new ManagementObjectrootCIMV2, WMIQuery, null     ManagementBaseObject inParams  null     ManagementBaseObject outParams  null      string[] OldIP  string[]NICConfig[IPAddress]      try               Set IPSubnet mask          inParams  NICConfig.GetMethodParametersEnableStatic         inParams[IPAddress]  IP         inParams[SubnetMask]  Subnet          outParams  NICConfig.InvokeMethodEnableStatic, inParams, null          if outParams[ReturnValue].ToString  0                      MessageBox.ShowError setting IP, returned   outParams[ReturnValue]                    Set Gateways          inParams  NICConfig.GetMethodParametersSetGateways         inParams[DefaultIPGateway]  Gateway         inParams[GatewayCostMetric]  new int[] 1          outParams  NICConfig.InvokeMethodSetGateways, inParams, null          if outParams[ReturnValue].ToString  0                      MessageBox.ShowError setting Gateway, returned   outParams[ReturnValue]                    Set DNS Servers          inParams  NICConfig.GetMethodParametersSetDNSServerSearchOrder         inParams[DNSServerSearchOrder]  DNS         outParams  NICConfig.InvokeMethodSetDNSServerSearchOrder, inParams, null          if outParams[ReturnValue].ToString  0                      MessageBox.ShowError setting DNS, returned   outParams[ReturnValue]                   bool IPMatches  false         string[] currentIPs  null         int timeout  2000         int i          for i  0 i lt timeout ampamp IPMatches i                      currentIPs  string[]NICConfig[IPAddress]             if currentIPs  IP  currentIPs  OldIP                              IPMatches  true                 break                          Task.Delay100                  if i gt timeout                      MessageBox.ShowTimeout while setting static IP address                    catchManagementException e              MessageBox.Showsetstatic threw exception   e.Message           return IPMatches  codepre  pThe machines Ive tested this on are a laptop running Windows 7 x64, I get the same behavior with the internal NIC and a USB NIC, and a tablet running Windows 8.1 x64 with the same USB NIC.p

Ill do my best to try and explain what the issue is, and Id really appreciate any help anyone can give me about it.p  pMy situation simplified is thisp  pI have a service which loads some info from a json and stores it in an object. It also have some functions to be used for other controllers to retrieve that information.p  precodevar particServices  angular.moduleparticServices, []  particServices.serviceparticSrv, function     var data      this.updateData  functionscope      data   http call, saves in data       this.getName  functioncode      return data.name      codepre  pI have an html page assisted by a controller, which uses a directive board no params, really simple. This is the controllerp  precodevar bControllers  angular.modulebControllers, []  bControllers.controllerbController, [scope, particSrv, function scope, particSrv      scope.getName  functioncode       return particSrv.getNamecode   particSrv.updateDatascope         ] codepre  pAs you can see, the controller makes the call to initialize the object in the service. As this is a singleton, I understand once that info is loaded no other call needs to be make to updateData and that info is available to others using the getters in the service getName in this case.p  pI have a really simple directive board which I simplified here, which uses another directive bio.p  pangular.moduletsDirectives, []p  precode.directiveboard, [dataSrv, particSrv, functiondataSrv, particSrv     return      restrict E,     replace true,     scope true,     controller functionscope                               scope.getName  functioncode           return particSrv.getNamecode               dataSrv.updateDatascope, board, U                                   ,     templateUrl ltdiv classboardgtltdiv bio classname particgetNamecodegtltdivgtltdivgt        ] codepre  pAnd this is the bio directivep  precodeangular.modulegDirectives, []  .directivebio, function       return      scope        partic amp     ,               controller functionscope                  scope.name  scope.particcode scope.athid     ,     template lta nghrefPROFILE.htmlgtnameltagt         codepre  pNow, what I expected is that in the bio directive the info retrieved from party was displayed, but apparently this directive is processed before the partic is initialized in the main controller.p  pI was under the impression that even though this information was still not loaded when the directive is processed, as soon as the service finishes and the info is ready, automagically it would appear in my directive, but that does not seem to work like that. Ive been reading about watch and digest, but I fail to see why and if I would need to call them manually to fix this.p  pAny hint will be much appreciated.

When an error happens, the controller renders the codeeditcode action, which results in another error in my view, cause now the helper that generates the fields for the nested form is receiving a null value for client.p  pThe codeviewcode in question that generates the error looks like thisp  pstrongpurchasesclientidedit.html.hamlstrongp  precode formfor client, url gt controller gt purchase, action gt update do f    if client.errors.any     errorexplanation       h2         The following errors were found       ul          client.errors.fullmessages.each do message           li message   render form, f f   .actions     f.submit Save Changes, class gt btn btnmd btnprimary codepre  pThe error says First argument in form cannot contain nil or be empty, which Im assuming it is cause the render is not sending the id of the Client.p  pIn case youre wondering, Im using codeformfor client, url gt controller gt purchase, action gt update do fcode cause this view is not in the Client controller. if I omit the extra parameters, the form is sent directly to the Client controller, which has different code pertaining only to the Client model.p  pIve partially managed to work around this by using the following in the update actionp  precodedef update   respondto do format     if client.updateclientparams        snip     else       format.html  redirectto editpurchasepathclient        format.json  render json client.errors, status unprocessableentity      end   end end codepre  pThis will redirect me back to the edit action, but no errors are printed. I get an identical page with the values used before I edited the values of the Transaction. Im think there must be an easy way to send the errors back to the view, but Im not sure where are these supposed to be used.p  pThe original controller was generated by a scaffold, so the coderender editcode part is from the scaffolding itself. Im aware my example could be somewhat vague Im just transcribing what Im experiencing, so bear with me if this sounds a little odd. Ill gladly go into more detail if the information provided isnt enough.p

Negative 8125 pI have a body following my player in a game I made and the player is of type Actor scene2D. In his overriding act method he uses libgdx input to move. For example,pseudo ifgdxInput.keyskeys.up applyForceToCenterVElocity xCoor  body.x yCoor  body.yp  pHow do I make sure the body doesnt slide all over the place The world has a gravity of 0,0 so if i click the up arrow the player will never stop so in my huge if else if block statement of input i put else linearVelocity  0 this works however if the player is holding the right arrow key then holds the up arrow key the player moves right more then up as if he is sliding on ice. Please tell me how to turn all gravity off of the player in general. I cant just set the position of the body because im using the bodies as a way of collision and to set the position of the body is to turn off collision.p

Negative 8125 pI understand threading to a certain extent, but in practice I have little experience. In looking at this code that I am maintaining, it seems that the AWAIT provides no benefit. All calls to this method are via AJAX and happen only when a user clicks an export link. Since the method does nothing else, I dont see any advantage to AWAIT and instead imagine that it actually introduces some overhead. I also believe that all other users clicking export would be entering this method as their own thread, right So this might only be useful if a single user clicked export many times, quickly Thank you.p  precode[PreventLogging]     [HttpPost]     public async TaskltJsonResultgt GetActivityReportCallsAsync[DataSourceRequest] DataSourceRequest request              try                      var result  await GetAllCallsAsync             return Jsonresult.ToDataSourceResultrequest                  catch Exception exc                      return JsonShowMessagefalse, ServerMessageType.Error, exc.Message               codepre

Im tripping up when using the Kendo Grid with Ajax where its passing Json to the view and Im lost on how to get the addresses and phone data into the view.  Sorry this is probably basic, if someone could point me to some documentation on best practices for using the Kendo controls it might help me get unstuck.

Negative 8125 pIm new to distributed databases.

Negative 8125 pI am an experienced programmer but I dont have a lot of experience implementing DSP routines.p  pIve been banging my head against this for weeks if not months. My question is two fold, concerning Apples Accelerate frameworkp  p1p  pIn the vDSP.h header there are comments to the effect of please use vDSPDFTXXX instead of the i guess older versions vDSPfftXXX. However there are emzeroem examples of this outside of Apples a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryprereleasemacsamplecodevDSPExamplesListingsDemonstrateDFTc.htmlapplerefdocuidDTS10004300DemonstrateDFTcDontLinkElementID6 relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryprereleasemacsamplecodevDSPExamplesListingsDemonstrateDFTc.htmlapplerefdocuidDTS10004300DemonstrateDFTcDontLinkElementID6a.

Negative 8125 pI found this question in a textbook I am reading. The solution is given below it as well. Im having trouble understanding how the minimum could be 2. Why couldnt a thread read 0, all other threads execute and it writes 1 And whether it is 1 or 2, the thread writing last must still complete its own loop p  precodeint n  0 int mainint argc, char argv   for i  0 i lt 5 i   int tmp  n  tmp  tmp  1  n  tmp    return 0  codepre  blockquote   pIf a single thread ran this application, you would expect the final   output to be 5. What if 5 threads ran the same loop in parallel What   are the largest and smallest values n could have The largest should   be selfevident 25, with 5 increments from 5 threads. However,   reasoning about the smallest possible value is more difficult. Hint n   can be less than 5, but it is up to you to figure out why.p blockquote  pSolutionp  blockquote   pWith five threads running this fiveiteration loop and with no   protection from concurrent accesses, the lowest value that n can reach   is two. Understanding how to reach this result is easiest when working   backwards from the final result. For the final output to be two, a   thread must have read a value of one from n, incremented it, and then   written two. That means that another thread wrote one, implying that   it also initially read zero which is also the starting value for n.   This accounts for the behavior of two of the five threads. However,   for this behavior to occur the results of the other three threads must   have been overwritten. Two valid executions could accomplish this.   Either 1 all three threads began and completed execution between the   first thread reading zero and writing one, or 2 all three threads   began and completed execution between the final thread reading one and   writing two. Both execution orderings are valid.p blockquote

Negative 8125 pmy name is Joe and I am strongverystrong new to Excel VBA programming.  I was asked to put together a program that facilitated in the analysis of parking data at my internship, and I decided to use Excel as the base to store the data and create charts.  I also decided I would need to use macros to improve the functionality and automation of the program.p  pI learned basic Excel VBA just to develop this sheet, so it is literally my first time writing macros in Excel.  p  pAnyway, the sheet has data stored in columns for different time slots, and a cell at the top of the column labeling the column.  The data is separated by type of land use, such as Shopping Center, Cinema, Supermarket, etc.  The user is able to click a ComboBox to select a land use, and there is a macro that displays the data for that respective land use in the chart using the Range.Find method.  My problem is that some of the land uses do not have data associated with them for different functionalities, and I would like to be able to know this before the Range.Find method returns an error.  Therefore, I thought a simple If statement would work by incorporating the Range.Find.Execute method, which should return a Boolean value, but always returns an Error, Argument not Optional, when run instead.  The debugger always highlights Find. p  pI am doing the editing in the Excel IDE if you can call it that, and not an outside VBA editor.  My current version of Excel is 2010.  p  pI have also scoured Stack Overflow, MSDN, and other websites for an answer but I cannot seem to find one.  If I have missed an answer to this question I will remove it if I find one or if someone points it out.p  pBelow is some example code that could be used in the sheet, except the first line always returns an Error.  The example code from the MSDN website does not seem to work either.p  precodeIf RangeA1B20.Find.ExecuteComboBox1.Value  True Then      RangeA1B20.FindComboBox1.Value.Activate      And do this  Else      MsgBox No data available for this selection.

Negative 8125 pIm pretty new to developing mobile apps. I have written an HTML5 game and would like to make it available on Google Play and on the Apple store.

Is that where Cordova or Phonegap kicks inli liIm using a windows machine for now as my mac computer needs a new hard disk.li liI would like to test my app using a device i.e. not the browser. Physical, virtual, as long as its reliable and doesnt take 5 mins between I hit build and the moment the app starts running   ul liI have both a 4s iPhone and S3 Galaxy.li liI see things like Ionic deploy, phonegap build selfupdating apps without needing the user to perform appstorebased update.li liSeems there also are cloud services creating packages for all platforms without needing to have the various IDEs installed. Did I get it rightli ulli ul  pNB wishful thinking here I imagine there exists a method similar to a web developers F5 key to allow a one step build amp deploy capability.

I cant think of any way to do this without a ton of inefficient code..p  pIve tried experimenting to learn more about FileIO.FileSystem.GetFiles.. but only came up with this so farp  precodeDim curDate As Date  Date.Today Dim subDate As Date  curDate.AddDays7 Dim newDate As String  subDate.ToStringyyyyMMdd  For Each fileFound As String In FileIO.FileSystem.GetFileslogs,                                                            FileIO.SearchOption.SearchTopLevelOnly,                                                            newDate amp              Console.WriteLineFOUND FILE             Console.WriteLinefileFound Next codepre  pBut of course, that only finds log files that are named the date of 7 days ago from the current date..p  pIt also seems as if I need to get all files from the logs directory into an array and then remove any files that are newer than 7 days from the array. Then finally delete all files that remain in the array But howp  pCan anyone help Thanks much..p
