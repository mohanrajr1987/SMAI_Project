Positive 13829 pI am writing a managed Unity3d plugin which handles some web requests, registration and downloading content from the web. I am using the .Net WebClient class and the corresponding Async calls for downuploading content in a separate thread to avoid laggy UI.p  pI am now trying to find an easy way to retrieve the callbacks from those async calls on the unity3d side. Something like the follwing line of code does not work, obviouslyp  precodeMyManagedPlugin.RequestDataAsyncCallback codepre  pI also would like to avoid any thread specific code on the unity3d side meaning in the scripts so that all the async calls are encapsulated in the managed plugin. I am not sure if that is possible at all since there need to be some kind of polling mechanism to on the main thread unit3d to check if a thread is done rightp

also tried such things as diverse as the ProgressChanged event after enabling it in Properties of course and various forms of delegates. This use to be a fairly simple matter with old delegates, but I spent 10 hours today with no success, and I almost never fail to find working code examples, even if I have to wade thru dozens of inferior answers. There is an utter profusion of contradictory answers to this question depending on the date of the post and the kind of approach suggested.p
Positive 13829 pIm experimenting with multithreading for the first time. Im using codeQueue.Queuecode and putting data in there after Ive created a set of objects that inherit from codethreading.Threadcode. The script downloads a series of files and works perfectly fine, I have it downloading and it has proven much faster than my old one.p  pHowever, my thread begins with a print command to show that it has begun downloading. Just a simple Downloading Cfoo.bar. When the queue is first created, all these print commands are stuck together, and then the newlines all appear afterwards.p  pHeres a basic idea of the code involvedp  precodeimport Queue import threading  queue  Queue.Queue  class ThreadDownloadthreading.Thread     Threaded Download      def initself, queue         threading.Thread.initself         self.queue  queue      def runself         while True             data  self.queue.get              print Downloading .formatdata             downloadfiledata             time.sleep10              self.queue.taskdone  for i in range4     t  ThreadDownloadqueue     t.setDaemonTrue     t.start  for d in data for d in range20     queue.putd  queue.join codepre  pNote that codedownloadfilecode is a function from a 3rd party library that people are unlikely to know or have easy access to so Ive left it out in favour of people putting some other time consuming call for their testing. Likewise with codedatacode, the form of data is irrelevant to the question so instead I suggest people use coderangecode in order to test easily.p  pHeres what output might look likep  precodeDownloading Cfoo.barDownloading Cfoo.barDownloading Cfoo.barDownloading Cfoo.bar    Downloading Cfoo.bar Downloading Cfoo.bar Downloading Cfoo.bar codepre  pThe reason seems to be because of the fact that these threads are starting their run simultaneously. If I add codetime.sleep0.01code I can prevent it but thats a hacky approach. And Im also concerned that this could mean that if two downloads coincidentally started at the same split second it would happen again.p  pIs there any way to actually enforce a separation here so I dont get this problem I have heard that you shouldnt have threads handle UI, thats usually in the context of something like redrawing a progress bar though. Also Im not sure if theres a convenient way to note when an item from the queue has been taken by a thread, but perhaps Ive missed it.p
Positive 13829 pI have a piece of code I only want to execute once, but its possible to get several requests at the same time, more specifically, a document operation.p  pThe logic is the first thread to arrive does the code and the others wait for the first one to finish and then all return.p  pSince this can happen to any document, I created a dictionary that holds the locking object for each document by idp  precodeprivate static readonly object LockFetchDocument  new object private static readonly Dictionaryltint, objectgt DocumentLocks  new Dictionaryltint, objectgt  Lets add the monitor for this document this has to be threadsafe too lock LockFetchDocument      if DocumentLocks.ContainsKeydocModel.DocumentId              DocumentLocks.AdddocModel.DocumentId, new object        lets aquire the Monitor for this document so we dont prefetch the same document at the same time if Monitor.TryEnterDocumentLocks[docModel.DocumentId]      document is being exported, lets wait for it to end     lock DocumentLocks[docModel.DocumentId]              document was exported, return         return        Monitor aquired try      DO WORK  finally      Lets release the monitor for this document     lock DocumentLocks[docModel.DocumentId]              Monitor.ExitDocumentLocks[docModel.DocumentId]       codepre  pIs this logic good In order to make the dictionary adding, I use another locker. But I get a Resharper warning that the Monitor.TryEnter is not inside synchronization block. Is it neededp
Positive 13829 pI have a simulation running on a stdthread that has regular sleeping periods and at the end of each period a hrefhttpdoc.qt.ioqt5qwidget.htmlupdate relnofollowQWidgetupdatea is called on my custom QGraphicsObject. It works most of the time, sometimes calculating 100k iterations on a 10242 grid, but sometimes from a point QGraphicsView doesnt update itself anymore. I suspect some multithreaded communication problem.p  pIve read that Cocos2dx for example cant handle concurrent calls in its API excluding some property modification. I havent found information about thread safety on Qt docs, some people here said Qt Widgets are not threadsafe. Actually QWidgetupdate is a public slot, so shall I try converting all direct function calls to update to emit signals I would like to do my threading in pure c, what are constraints of this when working with Qtp  pIll open a new question specifically about the problem if using stdthread like this is supposed to be safep

But although it may be a situation where from the modem does not answer came CONN, and the call has been completed, ie, Modem immediately generates a response CEND, in this case it is necessary to complete the thread that is waiting for CONN to send a reset command call.

Positive 13829 pI am currently working an c application that will work as the serverside of a multiplayer game and I am slightly unsure as to how I should be handling multithreading issues. Before I continue, it is probably worth mentioning that I am quite new to this topic.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pOne of the requirements of the serverside application is that it should contain applicationspecific data, such as information on peers that have connected to the server, as well as their location and so on. The problem is that without some form of threadsafe mechanic, it is possible for two requests to be reading and writing to the same piece of data, which is obviously problematic.p  pstrongSolving the problemstrongp  pUp until now, to solve the problem I have simply been wrapping every request inside of a lock block, ensuring that every request happens in a serial order, so that data is only ever being manipulated by one peer at a time.p  pRecently, after doing some research on the topic I was introduced to the idea of a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiFiber28computerscience29 relnofollowfibersa, and a way of setting up a fiber pool, allowing the ability to queue actions onto a single fiber as another way of trying to ensure that requests happen in a serial order.p  pstrongThe questionstrongp  pMy knowledge on threading and these types of topics is pretty limited. I would love to know more about this topic, in particular I would love to know the pros and cons of either solution and ultimately which route I should be taking.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Positive 13829 pIm confused about how to properly and safely pass data from GUI elements on the eventdispatchthread EDT to a SwingWorker that needs to interact with that data.  Ive followed the many examples on stackoverflow and around the web  no matter which way I try to write, it seems like Im breaking the oath to never touch GUI elements from a different thread.p  pIll try to illustrate my confusion with pseudocode.p  pIve got a JFrame with some swing elements to take input from user.  User clicks a JButton, the JButton disables so user cant click it twice, and their input is passed to the SwingWorker in a background threadp  precodeimport javax.swing. import java.awt.event.  class GUI implements Runnable     JFrame jFrame     JTextField userInputTextField     JButton beginLongTaskButton      GUI         initialize the GUI elements, add them to JFrame, JPanel, etc.          this.beginLongTaskButton  new JButtonBegin Task         this.beginLongTaskButton.addActionListenera gt beginLongTasklambda sure is nice           void beginLongTask         this.beginLongTaskButton.setEnabledfalse         this.beginLongTaskButton.setTextDoing your long task...

I think even the JavaDoc SwingWorker example does it this way.  But doesnt it mean Im messing with objects on a different thread when Im not supposed to  And does reading not changing the value of GUI components still violate the crossthreading rule If my SwingWorker must frequently read data from GUI elements, wont that slow down the EDTp  pMaybe the right thing to do is extract the data I need from the GUI elements within the EDT, then pass that extracted data to the SwingWorker  As opposed to directly passing the GUI element to the SwingWorker.p

If its updated just inside one thread, the other thread may still use old, invalid pointer. How to assure its updated in both but using methods through the pointer doesnt trigger the above errorp  pExtended infop  pThe smart glue logic library Im writing is used to pass and convert messages between a 3rd party software and a custom device. It consists of three essential threadsp  ul lia handler the main thread of the 3rd party app periodically calls a calculate function in my library to handle new updates  data to send, data receivedli lia sender thread that converts and sends whatever the handler pushed into the send bufferli lia listener thread that converts and pushes any data received from the device into receive buffer.li ul  pBoth the sender and the listener threads use the same utility class that handles network communication with the device upon initialization the class creates a connection to the device, and the two threads perform blocking reads or await for new data to send respectively. In case of any problems, the sender thread performs all maintenance work, while the listener thread enters a safe state awaiting return of connectivity.p  pNow, since the two threads share one connection to the device, they both share the same instance of the communication class, as a pointer to that class.p  pThe problem is in the procedure of reconnect  it involves destroying and creating the helper class instance exploiting safe shutdown and initialization already present in the destructor and constructor. As result the pointer changes. Without codevolatilecode its quite likely the listener wont receive the updated pointer. With volatile, it protests  needlessly, because codenccode the pointer wont change at a random moment  first the listener is notified of a problem, then it enters a safe state where it doesnt perform any operations on nc and notifies the sender its ready. Only then the sender performs the repair and notifies the listener to resume normal operation.p  pSo whats the right solution in this situationp

Positive 13829 pstrongPlease notestrong Although this question mentions Java, I think its an OOPconcurrency problem at heart and can probably be answered by anyone with significant programming experience.p  hr  pSo Im building a codeConfigurationLoadercode that will read codeConfigurationcode POJO from a remote service and make it available via an API.

Positive 13829 pI have a piece of code which I want to only be running once at a time. Its not the end of the world if it runs more than once concurrently, but its heavy on resources and thats the problem.

There can be up to 2000 tasks, and it is going to happen with some regularity that all 2000 tasks finish at the exact same time. Normally I would just use codedispatchgroupnotifycode or similar, but this means that HEAVYSTUFF runs 2000 times when it only needs to run once. Also it is a requirement that the 1999 threads do not wait, because they are holding a lot of memory  for example if the 1999 threads sit on a dispatch wait, then they consume 300MB on my iPhone 5S even with careful codeautoreleasepoolcode wrappings.

Positive 13829 pI am fairly new to Qt  QtQuick and I have to develop an application, which uses some sensor data that is received in a different thread over network periodically. This data should be used inside c for calculations and the latest data should also be displayed in QML. Everything is setup to be threadsafe inside c by using a mutex for protection and the data is visibly updated inside QML.  However, I have some concerns about threadsafety on the QML side and I cannot find information or an example on the web about this topic. Specifically I am concerned about returning a pointer which was the only way to return a C object to QML I guess instead of a value and therefore a copy of the object. Here is a minimal example demonstrating the concernp  precode File data.h include ltQObjectgt  class Data  public QObject      QOBJECT     QPROPERTYQString someData READ someData WRITE setSomeData NOTIFY someDataChanged  public     explicit DataQObject parent  nullptr          QObjectparent                QString someData const           return someData           void setSomeDataconst QStringamp value           if someData  value               someData  value              emit someDataChanged                 signals     void someDataChanged  private     QString someData    Data    File controller.h include ltQObjectgt  include ltthreadgt  class Controller  public QObject      QOBJECT     QPROPERTYData data READ data NOTIFY dataChanged  public     explicit ControllerQObject parent  nullptr          QObjectparent         ,runningfalse         ,datanullptr              data  new Data           virtual Controller          delete data           void start          running  true         thread  stdthread[this]  threadFunc            void stop          running  false          if thread.joinable              thread.join                    Data data          return data       signals     void dataChanged  private     void threadFunc          while running              stdthisthreadsleepforstdchronomilliseconds10             data.setSomeDatafoo             emit dataChanged                    bool running     stdthread thread     Data data    Controller   File main.qml import QtQuick 2.0  Rectangle      width 100     height 100      Text          anchors.centerIn parent         text Controller.data.someData       codepre  pData is a simple container holding a QString as property. The controller contains the property data and starts a thread that periodically updates data and emits changes as signal. The output will be displayed correctly, but it feels pretty unsafe to return a raw pointer. So my questions here arep  ol liWhat happens if the data is written too fast and the thread manipulates the data at the same time when QML is using the pointer to update the visualsli liAre there alternatives to returning a raw pointer, e.g., something Qt offers for this purpose and something I have not found yetli liIs my kind of thinking wrong when it comes to using QtQML I first developed the C backend without any Qt parts and now I am trying to connect it to the GUI. Maybe I should better design the backend around Qt or QMLfriendly from start respectivelyli ol

Negative 13829 pI am working on a 2.0 framework C web application.  Recently it was brought to my attention that when an event occurs button submits in particular on the page and then the other ASP controls are moused over textboxes, radio buttons, regular buttons they appear to shift down, all the while you can see the control in its original position underneath This gives the effect of having duplicate controls, one overlapping the other.  When the page is refreshed the issue goes away until another event takes place.p  pTo give some background, the users only experience this in IE.  Of all the people I had test this, it only happens on a very small number of computers.

Negative 13829 pIm creating a graphical roguelike game using Java. In the game, Im painting a 2d array of Tile objects onto a JPanel. These Tile objects represent the ground. I have a .bmp sprite sheet that contains all of the textures I want to use to paint with. Every time the player moves, the tiles that are visible to the player need to be redrawn.p  pMy question is a performance question. I have implemented this in the past to where I have the Tiles extend JPanel and each Tile just displays the appropriate segment of the sprite sheet using the bufferedImage.getSubImage, while the parent JPanel simply calls paint on all of the Tiles in the 2d array. This worked fine for the small 30x20 maps in the previous project, but Im not sure it would work on the current game.p  pShould I use the same approach or is there some other possible solution that will speed up draw times Should the Tile class extend some other Swing or AWT component such as BufferedImage or will that not have an effectp  pThanks.p

Negative 13829 pSay I have a schema that represents a fixeddepth hierarchy like thisp  precode CREATE TABLE level0      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,     text TEXT NOT NULL  CREATE TABLE level1      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,     text TEXT NOT NULL,     level0id INTEGER NOT NULL  CREATE TABLE level2      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,     text TEXT NOT NULL,     level1id INTEGER NOT NULL,     isimportant INTEGER    CREATE INDEX level2level1id ON level2 level1id CREATE INDEX level1level0id ON level1 level0id codepre  pJust to give a sense of scale,  assume 1000 rowsin level0, 2000 in level1, and 20000 in level2 and this is a sqlite database on an phones sd card. Level 0 queries return up  to 1000 rows, level1 queries return 130 rows, and level2 queries return 120 rowsp  pIm displaying this hierarchy one level at a time. So my queries for displaying each of the three levels look like thisp  precode SELECT id,text FROM level0 SELECT id,text FROM level1 WHERE level0id  12345 SELECT id,text FROM level2 WHERE level1id  23456 codepre  pSimple, fast, and fully indexed. Now, I also want to display the same hierarchy, except I want to filter it based on isimportant. I only want to display level0 and level1 rows that eventually lead to level2 rows with isimportant  1.p  pSo I write some new queries, very different from the old ones.p  precode level 0  SELECT DISTINCT l0.id,l0.text FROM level2 AS l2 INNER JOIN level1 AS l1 ON l1.id  l2.level1id INNER JOIN level0 as l0 on l0.id  l1.level0id WHERE l2.isimportant  1  level 1  SELECT DISTINCT l1.id,l1.text FROM level2 AS l2 INNER JOIN level1 AS l1 ON l1.id  l2.level1id WHERE l2.isimportant  1  level 2  SELECT id,text FROM level2 WHERE level1id  23456 AND isimportant  1 codepre  pThe level 0 and level 1 queries are obviously much, much, slower than the unfiltered queries above. I understand why they are slow, but Im having trouble improving their performance.p  pI feel strange starting the query by walking the largest table to extract the smaller ones, but this seems like the most succinct and natural way to express what I want in terms that SQL can understand. p  pSo my question is this How would you improve the performance of the filtered level 0 and level 1 queries abovep

Negative 13829 pIve recently started learning programming to make my own 3D OpenGL game on the iPhone and have made reasonably decent progress so far. I started off using the basic OpenGL example that is provided with the iPhone SDK which helped me get off to a good start. However, as Im starting to get the hang of things, it has occurred to me that Im unnecessarily programming in Objective C which will make it harder to port the game to other platforms in the future. So I figured that it would be best to make it properly C now to avoid lots of extra work later.p  pTo clarify Im not actually using any calls to Apple Objective C functions or anything, its just that Ive based all my clases on the Objective Cstyle initdeallocetc, so that my engine looks like Objective C classes when used. My aim is to replace all the objective C stuff with the C equivalents... the trouble is that, being pretty new to C, Im not sure what corresponds with whatp  pHeres a simple example of one of my classes myLight, in its current Objective C incarnationp  precode  myLight.h  import ltOpenGLESEAGL.hgt import ltOpenGLESES1gl.hgt import ltOpenGLESES1glext.hgt  interface myLight  NSObject      char name     GLfloat ambient, diffuse, specular, position, spotDirection     GLfloat spotRadius      GLfloat matAmbient, matDiffuse, matSpecular     GLfloat shininess     Byte lightType  property readonly char name property assign GLfloat position property assign GLfloat spotDirection  property assign GLfloat ambient property assign GLfloat diffuse property assign GLfloat specular   idinitWithContentsFromDatastreamNSData fileData  voidset  end codepre  pAnd the corresponding .mm filep  precode  myLight.m  import myLight.h  implementation myLight synthesize name, ambient, diffuse, specular, position, spotDirection   idinitWithContentsFromDatastreamNSData fileData      self  [super init]     NSData fileContents  fileData     uint ptr  0      Byte nameLength     [fileContents getBytesampnameLength range NSMakeRangeptr, sizeofByte]     ptr      name  new char[nameLength]     [fileContents getBytesname range NSMakeRangeptr, nameLength  sizeofchar ]     ptr  ptr  nameLength  sizeofchar       [fileContents getBytesamplightType range NSMakeRangeptr, sizeofByte]     ptr      position  new GLfloat[4]     forint j  0 j lt 4 j         [fileContents getBytesampposition[j] range NSMakeRange j sizeoffloat   ptr, sizeoffloat]     ptr  ptr  4  sizeoffloat      iflightType2         spotDirection  new GLfloat[3]         forint j  0 j lt 3 j             [fileContents getBytesampspotDirection[j] range NSMakeRange j sizeoffloat   ptr, sizeoffloat]         ptr  ptr  3  sizeoffloat          [fileContents getBytesampspotRadius range NSMakeRangeptr, sizeoffloat]         ptr  ptr  sizeoffloat      else          spotDirection  NULL      diffuse  new GLfloat[4]     forint j  0 j lt 4 j         [fileContents getBytesampdiffuse[j] range NSMakeRange j sizeoffloat   ptr, sizeoffloat]     ptr  ptr  4  sizeoffloat      ambient  new GLfloat[4]     forint j  0 j lt 4 j         [fileContents getBytesampambient[j] range NSMakeRange j sizeoffloat   ptr, sizeoffloat]     ptr  ptr  4  sizeoffloat      specular  new GLfloat[4]     forint j  0 j lt 4 j         [fileContents getBytesampspecular[j] range NSMakeRange j sizeoffloat   ptr, sizeoffloat]     ptr  ptr  4  sizeoffloat      [self set]    return self    voidset     glEnableGLLIGHTING     glEnableGLLIGHT0     glLightfvGLLIGHT0, GLAMBIENT, ambient     glLightfvGLLIGHT0, GLDIFFUSE, diffuse     glLightfvGLLIGHT0, GLSPECULAR, specular     glLightfvGLLIGHT0, GLPOSITION, position      iflightType2         glLightfvGLLIGHT0, GLSPOTDIRECTION, spotDirection    voiddealloc      delete[] specular     delete[] ambient     delete[] diffuse      if spotDirection         delete[] spotDirection      delete[] position     delete[] name      [super dealloc]   end codepre  pIf someone could point out which lines need to be changed and, more importantly, what they should be changed to to make it compile as pure C, Id really appreciate it.p  pMany Thanksp

Negative 13829 pIm very curious how your Rails apps include javascript. For examplep  ul lido you package all your js code into a single file and serve it for all requestsli lido you conditionally load certain js depending on controlleractionli liwhat tools or techniques do you use, ie assetpackager, yui compressor, sprockets, BigPipe inspired implementationli ul  pA bit of background I work on a massive Rails app that is very JS heavy. Currently, all js is minified and served from a single file. This makes things very convenient as all frameworks and widgets are available everywhere. Im beginning to question this approach is it seems a bit crazy to make all users pay the price for some js that they may never see. Littering the code with script includes seems crappy and difficult as large portions of the site deliver content via ajax.p  pAnyone have any advice to sharep  pThanks muchp

Negative 13829 pJust installed Apache 2.2 installed as a module and latest PHP build on my local win 7 machine. However when I try to include a file I ma getting a permission denied error.  I tried all kinds of combination of permission setting but nothing works. Does anyone know if there is a good write up on this problem or if you could include instructions that would be great.p  pBTW  the file is there and the code is fine. This is definitely a permissions problem.p

I want canvas mouseDown observers to fire when and only when mouseDowns happen emoutsideem the dots, and for dot mouseDown observers to fire when and only when mouseDowns happen inside the dots. p  pHeres my technique for building the observable chain, showing that I set the EventArgs.Handled property in the triggering mouseDown event if the third argument of DownInAndTrackWrtObservable is truep  precodeprivate IObservableltBasedVectorgt DownInAndTrackWrtObservable     UIElement hitTestElement,      UIElement trackWrtElement,     bool handleItP  false      var hitObs  hitTestElement.GetLeftMouseDownObservable      var trackObs  from mDown in hitObs                    let mDownP  mDown.EventArgs.GetPositionhitTestElement                    from mMove in trackWrtElement.GetMouseMoveObservable.

Negative 13829 pI am running loops in R of the following varietyp  precodefori in 1N... codepre  pI would like to have a counter that displays the current value of codeicode in the progress of the loop.  I want this to keep track of how far along I am toward reaching the end of the loop.  One way to do this is to simply insert codeprinticode into the loop code. E.g.,p  precodefori in 1N ...substantive code that does not print anything... printi  codepre  pThis does the job, giving you the codeicodes that is running.

I would like to have a counter that does not eat up so much console space.  Sometimes its nice to be able to scroll up the console to check to be sure you are running what you think you are running.  So, Id like to have a counter that displays as,p  precode[1] 1 2 3 ... codepre  pcontinuing onto a new line once the console width has been reached.  I have seen this from time to time.

Negative 13829 pOK, well Ive been working on a simple app that allows users to save notes to contacts. It lists the contacts from the phone. User clicks on a contact and the notes entries that are related to the contact based on the contact ID are shown. The user can then add a new note by MenuAdd note. I can get all the way through the app but it wont save the data entered in the form to the database. When I try to save, I get a Null Pointer Exception. Nothing crashes, it just returns to the previous activity and doesnt do anything. I am kind of new to programming and have been teaching myself android for the past week and a half, so it could be something really simple. I have been digging around the web and frequently come to Stack Overflow to check for answers but cant seem to find anything on this one.

Negative 13829 pOur users love Microsoft Excel, like many of them. Some of our reports are pretty complex. We are using SSRS right now.p  pOne of the key problems with SSRS excel exports is that the users have to do a significant amount of little presentation adjustements after the file is exported.p  pSome of the reports are wide and do not fit the normal page in Excel, so they need to go to the Page Setup options in Excel and set the Fit to Page option. Also margins are too wide by default. SSRS does not have any way to adjust this in the exported Excel file automatically.p  pThere is also no way to my knowledge to freeze pane anywhere else than just after the header block, in the exported file automatically. Users need it to be set after the tables header columns, rather than the report header itself.p  pSSRS also does not support AutoFilter in Excel, users need to add these manually.p  pAs you can see, it is a significant amount of rework that needs to be done by the users after the file has been exported. I am looking for a decent and relatively well supported reporting engine that comes with a much better than average Excelexporting features, in the page layout department in particular.p  pSSRS, Crystal Reports, Telerik, and others I have tried all lacked this kind of features.p  pI am now considering rewriting the reports in pure code using an Excel component like SpreadsheetGear... but the idea of dealing with all the formatting, colouring, totals, etc, in code makes me a bit reluctant as a lot of code will be devoted to just formatting and it would be difficult to support and errorprone.p  pDoes anyone know of a great graphical reporting engine with great Excel exporting output, or has a better idea than generating the reports from scratch using codep  pThanks a lot in advance.p  pI am developping in .Net for the ASP.Net and WinForms platforms.p

Negative 13829 pI have a wpf c application, that loads tasks to a treeView from a text file, the data about the tasks are loading into a list, Im trying to delete data in position I in the list, but i can not figure out how. I have this for loop checking to see if the selected treeView item is equal to the item in position I in the list and if so I wanna delete that item from the list.

Negative 13829 pIve been programming for a while in objectivec, but Ive unfortunately never delved very deeply into C and memory pointers, although I do have a rudimentary understanding of them.

First of all, I get the p  precodeNSString aString a bunch of coordinates CLLocationCoordinate2d coordinates int length  doSomethingCoolaString, ampcoordinates, amplength codepre  pafter I do something cool, I want to preserve it in a class variable. If I simply do something likep  precodepoints  newPoints codepre  pempointsem contains the appropriate contents. However, if I try to do something like thisp  precodepoints  mallocsizeofCLLocationCoordinate2D  length points[0]  newPoints codepre  pempointsem ends up with contents different from emnewPointsem.p  pUltimately my goal is to be able to append to empointsem based on emlengthem, but Im not going to be able to do that if I cant get the above code to work.

Negative 13829 pOk, so I have the following two testexample queries to INSERT and UPDATE data from XML into a SQL 2008 table.

Negative 13829 pI have searched around Stackoverflow for the same question, but all questions that looks a little bit like my question are programmed in Xcode iPhone. Im using Javascript, but I cant figure it out how I solve this.p  pI created a star based on RaphaelJS. That star has a variable star points, so it could be a star with 8 points, but also 9 or 10 or 11.. My question is, I want text in a circle around that star. If the star has 8 points, then has every point it own word so 8 words.p  pI have my problem illustrated in Illustrator, so maybe that my question clarified p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6g41U.png altImagep  pOn this moment Im doing it with images, but that isnt flexible in the future I would generate the star and the words by using a database.

Negative 13829 pI developing an app which tracks a user via GPS and reminds them if they cross a toll bridge.p  pI obviously need the GPS location listener to run in a service and Ill also need a partialwakelock so it can run occasionaly when the phone is asleep. I also want the GPS updates to vary in frequency depending on the distance from the toll bridge to save battery. The cwac WakefulIntent service seems ideal for what Im trying to achieve.p  pHowever, there are a couple of problems I can see me having before I head down this route if you pardon the pun .p  pDoes the WakefulIntent service exit and release the wakelock once doWakefulWork completes even if Im waiting for my locationlistener to return some GPS updates.p  pHow can I prevent doWakefulWork for returning until I get a location update and cleanup my listener.p  pWhat happens if Im still waiting for a GPS update when alarm manager starts the service again, i.e. before doWakefulWork has completedp  pHow can I persist data between instanciations of the service. Can I stuff an array of GPS coords into SharedPrefsp  pFinally, as I get closer to a toll bridge I need more GPS frequent updates. Do I manage that within doWakefulWork or by altering scheduleAlarms so that it uses setRepeating with a number of minutes stored in SharedPrefs by the service. The idea here is to throttle GPS usage based on proximity to an area of interest.p  pWhile the demo app provides a template to work from, I havent been able to find any solid examples of WakefulIntentService doing any asynchronous jobs.p
Negative 13829 pIm attempting to make a grid based dungeon system at the moment in Visual Studio 2010. I have a main user control which contains 64 other smaller user control objects, which Ive called GridSquares, organised into an 8x8 grid. The idea behind the grid squares is to act as potential movement spaces within the dungeon. The problem I have at the moment is that I need to be able to call a click event on the user controls GridSquares themselves, which have been placed on screen so I can retrieve their coordinate name for comparison. However the event does not work when I call it through clicking.p  pI am aware that the events work when I place them within the usercontrol GridSquare object but I need the click even to work when the user control itself is clicked. p  pGiven that all 64 objects placed are the same type I can not work within the GridSquare class as I require the name of the user control to be returned through the event.p  pI hope this makes sense but please ask if I need to explain further.p  pMany thanks, Liamp  pEDIT Im not sure how much this will help or what code to display but the GridSpace controls have already been added to the dungeon user control.

Negative 13829 pI am experiencing an issue with an application that is attempting to access Quickbooks in blind mode i.e. Quickbooks is not running.  In short, I have a simple C application that synchronizes information between a Quickbooks company file and SQL database on a web server to allow customers to make payments toward invoices online.  The UI for the application only has one button and a few other settings so, I modified the code so that it can be run as a scheduled task in the middle of the night.  Unfortunately, this has been much more trouble than I anticipated.p  pFirst, I could not get it to run through the task scheduler or an elevated command prompt.  Then, I came across a post that stated that there is a bug in the SDK when attempting to access Quickbooks via the QBSDK if the host is a terminal server with multiple sessions.  The temporary solution was to make sure that Quickbook is running on the session that the job is running on to prevent it from trying to attach to another session.  So, I made sure that Quickbooks is loaded but, NOT logged in to a company file.  While this solution works if I try to run my application from an elevated command prompt it still does not work when the job is launched from the windows task scheduler.  I am not logged into the server remotely now but, the error message states something about not being able to open a session because there is a modal dialog box open.  I will modify the post to include the specific error message as soon as I am able to connect to my clients server.  Quickbooks is open on the session that is trying to run as a scheduled task and I am able to run the application from an elevated command prompt.  Can someone please offer any suggestions or feedback about how I might go about solving this problem  Thanks in advance for your helpp

Negative 13829 pIve desperately tried to figure out whats happened here, but havent seen this particular problem anywhere. Ive inherited as in, not built any of it myself management of a database server remote, in a data warehouse, accessed by ssh where some php daemons are running on a Linux server acting as data crawlers, inserting and processing information in a relatively steady stream into mysql.p  pA couple of days ago, the server crashed and came back on again. I logged in an restarted the mysql server and the crawlers, thinking no more of it. A day and a half later, the mysql server stopped working, and I couldnt diagnose it since I couldnt log into it, nor did it respond to etcinit.dmysql stop or varieties thereof. According to the log file, it kept throwing errors very regularly once every four minutes and 16 seconds and said that it had too many file handlers open. When I shut down the crawlers, however, I could log in again, but mysql kept throwing the errors.  I checked lsof and it showed a lot of open sockets with cant identify protocol error. p  blockquote   pmysqld  28843 mysql 1990u  sock        0,4              2856488 cant identify protocolp      pmysqld  28843 mysql 1989u  sock        0,4              2857220 cant identify protocolp blockquote  pThousands of these rowsp  pI thought it was something the crawlers had done, and I restarted mysql and the failed sockets disappeared. But I was surprised to see that mysql kept opening new ones, even when the crawlers werent running. It did this very regularly, about two new failed sockets a minute, regardless of whether the crawlers were active or not. I increased the maximum amount of filehandlers allowed for mysql to buy some time, but Im obviously looking for a diagnosis and permanent solution.p  pAll descriptions of such errors socket leaks that Ive found on forums seems to be about your own software leaking, not closing its sockets. But this seems to be mysql itself that does it, and there has been no change in any of the code from when it worked fine, just a server crash and restart.p  pAny ideasp

But why isnt using that a good idea  Why cant I find any formal documentation of it  Is it not part of the spec and standard  Is it not widely supported  Is it just because minification could break code using that syntaxp  pIf you could point me to more comprehensive docs of the feature, Id appreciate that.  What defines the contents of the codeifcode block  Is it indentation based  If it was, thatd be interesting.p  pOn another note, is there something similar to this syntax for codeifcode statements in PHP  I can swear that Ive seen them being used here and there, but I cant find any examples off hand.  Am I just crazy and it actually doesnt exist in PHP, or can those types of codeifcode blocks be used in PHP  Does such an codeifcode block support having an codeelsecode as well, both in JS and PHPp  pIt seems that theres an indentation based one as well as a singleline based syntax as well.

Negative 13829 pIm new to .net mvc and have become stuck when rendering data in my view. Im creating a small project management tool and I am currently working on the project admin section.p  pIm sending a model that contains a list of all projects that a user has to a view that administers projects. The project list is rendered in a table. The model contains everything relating to the projects, phases, project users etc. When I click on a row in the table, I would like to render the extended detail of that project below that table so it will display users and phases of the selected project. p  pWith jquery I can do this, but I would like to code this event in the view using .net code and not use Jquery. My main objective is not to call back to the server as I have all the data available in the model. p  pIve searched around and cant find that much detail about triggering events and rendering further detail on a page. I understand what partials do, but that would mean calling back to the server.p  pWhat is the best way to approach this type of problem Should I just use JQuery If I do use jquery, how do I then use html helpers in the script, if the script is not in the pagep

Negative 13829 pHow might one go about applying various different effects to a model while still maintaining properties for the different materials on different parts of the modelp  pI am using the Model class in xna and have created models in blender using the .fbx file format. As far as I am aware, loading a model through xnas content pipeline stores information about different materials in various BasicEffect instances for instance specular power and diffuse colour. What I want to do is apply various different custom effects to the models including all the point lights in my world while still having glossy sections of models retain their shiny appearance as an example. My idea was to never remap a model but to keep the BasicEffect instances as a reference to how certain materials should look. In this case I would need to manually draw each ModelMeshPart after applying the right effect. Am I thinking along the right lines to applying a lot of global effects to my models Is there perhaps a better way of accessing material information in a .fbx file Ought I to remap my models with one effect with all the techniques I could need crammed into itp

Negative 13829 pPep 8 has the following rulesp  blockquote   pBlank Linesp      pSeparate toplevel function and class definitions with two blank   lines.p      pMethod definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank   line.p      pExtra blank lines may be used sparingly to separate groups of   related functions. Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of   related oneliners e.g. a set of dummy implementations.p      pUse blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.p      pPython accepts the controlL i.e. L form feed character as   whitespace Many tools treat these characters as page separators, so   you may use them to separate pages of related sections of your file.   Note, some editors and webbased code viewers may not recognize   controlL as a form feed and will show another glyph in its place.p blockquote  pHowever, you cant have a emcompletelyem blank line inside a class defintionp  pExample from my headp  precodeclass bunny     def spamself         pass      def eggsself         pass  a second example class bunny2     def initself         self.eggs  None      def eggsself         doc  Spam and Eggs          def fgetself, value             return self.eggs          def fsetself, value             self.eggs  value          def fdelself             del self.eggs          return locals     eggs  propertyeggs codepre  pThe line between spam and eggs needs to be a blank line, however, that will result in a parse error of unexpected indentation. Is there another character that should go in that space My assumption is just leave the spacestabs on the blank line because it is more readable.p  pIn the second example nested defs need to have their previous lines indention maintained for the parse to work correctly. What is the correct PEP 8 way to handle this Blank line, blank line with white space, no linep

Negative 13829 pI have a dropdown menu where users have to choose an option. Should the option not be listed there, then the user can check a checkbox which, at the same time, disables the dropdown menu and enables the textbox. By this way the user can write his option that is not listed in the menu. That works fine. However, if the users check the box to type another option and press submit and, lets say, other things in the form validation are wrong causing the system to return to the form, if the user had already checked the box, it should now appear as it was the dropdown menu disabled and the textbox enabled with its content that the user had typed. I have managed to keep this information with PHP, but the problem is that, even though the checkbox appears checked, the dropdown menu is enabled and the textbox is not.p  pHow can i fix thisp  pWell, i have got what i want this script to do by using only javascript.

Negative 13829 pI have a cross platform application using .NET for Windows and Mono for Mac  OSX.p  pMy application deals with filenames and writes serialized data structures to disk which contain filenames as Strings.  Some of these filenames have international characters like accents.p  pWhen I copy my data files which were created on Windows NTFS to Mac, I have some problems with the files whose names have these international accent characters.p  pThe filenames which were read from NTFS and serialized by .NET contain a single character for the accented letter, but when I read the filename from the filesystem using Mono on OSX, I get the two character representation which doesnt match the serialized representation.  I need to maintain consistency between the serialized filenames and the actual filesystem on both Windows and Mac.p  pFor example, the letter  was gotten from a filename using .NET on Windows and was serialized as a single character with integer value 233.  On OSX, I use Mono to read the filename of the copied file and that letter is represented with two characters of integer values 101 and 769, which represent the letter and accent as distinct characters.  The problem is that this representation does not match the serialized representation that was written on Windows.p  pI need to find some way to enforce consistency  either in the serialized data structures containing the filenames, or in the filenames themselves.p  pIs there some way in .NETMono to canonicalize these different string representations  I looked at the Normalize method, but I dont think that it does what I want.  Either that or I am not understanding the documentation.p  pCan NTFS also store filenames with the two character representation of accented letters  If so, will it treat the two representations as being distinct  I might prefer to do the canonicalization on the actual filenames themselves.p  pMy thanks in advancep

However, it is not, since it is the topleft point of the child that goes to code50code of the parents width, therefore the whole childs width of code200pxcode goes to the right from there, leaving code250pxcode of free space on the left and only code50pxcode on the right.p  pSo, my question is, how to achieve strongcenter positioningstrongp  pI found this solutionp  precodeposition absolute width 200px left 50 marginleft 100px codepre  pbut I dont like it because you need to edit it manually for each elements width  I would like something that works globally.p  pFor example, when I work in Adobe After Effects, I can set a position for an object and then set specific anchor point of that object that will be put to that position. If the canvas is code1280pxcode wide, you position an object to code640pxcode and you choose the center of the object to be your anchor point, then the whole object will be centered within the code1280pxcode wide canvas.p  pI would imagine something like this in CSSp  precodeposition absolute left 50 horizontalanchor center codepre  pSimilarly, codehorizontalanchor rightcode would position the element by its right side, so the whole content would be to the left from the point of its parents code50code width.p  pAnd, the same would apply for codeverticalanchorcode, you get it.p  pSo, is something like this possible using strongonly CSSstrong no scriptingp  pThanksp

Negative 13829 pI have an application that is communicating with an arduino and it runs a netty instance for controlling the arduino. The problem is I am not running out of memory but total heap size to used heap size is too low according to the adb logcat I am always around 10 free so any request to the netty server triggers a gc at which time I get a bunch of,p  precodeDdalvikvm 2862 WAITFORCONCURRENTGC blocked 189ms codepre  peven simple requests that does not do anything at least by me loses atleast a second on gc pauses. I have p  precodeandroidlargeHeaptrue codepre  pset in my manifest and the simulator device has VM Heap of 512 mb but it is not allocating anywhere near that number It is allocating around 10MB. I do not have a memory leak because 10 free is stable it goes  23. Even on a phone with 2 gigs of ram with all other applications closed I am always running with less then 2 3 MB of free heap is there a workaround for thisp
Negative 13829 pWe are migrating from ColdFusion 8 to 10. Our application is having functionality written in .NET as well however the session is maintained in ColdFusion only. p  h2Current architecture in ColdFusion 8 for .NET and CF integrationh2  ol liSession is set when user logs in to the app In CF. We are using J2EE sessions.li lipWhen a user clicks on a .NET link, codeJsessionid,CFIDcode and codeCFTOKENcode are passed to .net page via url.  Inside .net code the following steps are done to check sessionp  p2a. Call a common function which will do a ColdFusion file request chkSession.cfm with codejsessionidcode in url.p  p2b. chkSession.cfm will return codesession.UIDcode if available else will return 1. codeSession.UIDcode will be available if the codejsessionidcode in url is valid.p  p2c. .NET page will be loaded if a valid UID is returned. User will be redirected to login page if 1 is returned. pli ol  h2Issue in CF 10h2  pIn CF 10 , always we are getting 1. I read that as part of security enhancement in CF 10, we will not be able to recreate a ColdFusion session by passing codecfidecode, codecftokencode, codejsessionidcode in the url. p  pI would like to get your advice on what is the best way to make our .NET functionalties work in ColdFusion 10. Is there any better way to check ColdFusion session from .NET   One option I can think of is using a database. I looking forward to a solution that can be implemented quickly and is robust.p

Any .NET techniques I could use to achieve this with out writing a new classp  pEDIT To answer some questions Why I need to know when a piece of code is busy before even trying to execute. Lets assume that we have two buttons on the UI, A and B. A executes methodA, and B executes methodB. They both use the same object to locksync. I would like to disable these buttons when I see someone is already executing a piece of code that is locked by the sync object instance syncObject. I would like to give the user an indication that the function cant be executed at the moment.p  pMonitor.TryEnter , or trying to verify if the lock is available is not a solution, since it requires polling and is not a notification.p  precodevoid methodA  locksyncObject  ...    void methodB   locksyncObject  ...   codepre

The idea is to analyze a sound signal, containing the sound of someone dialing a phone number on an oldfashioned analog phone line.

So I loop through the original signal x, and each time the analyzed part of the signal is of this length and named s. I Fouriertransform it to S, and analyze the energy at different points of the spectrum. If there are peaks of significant energy I attempt to classify these peaks to a number according to the table given as a comment in the beginning of the code. p  pHowever, the output this code generates is only an empty string. I am suspicious about the spectrum, which I plot in each window, since it often contains 4 peaks instead of 2. Additionally, the low peaks seem to be at slightly too low frequencies, and the high peaks at much too high frequencies compared with the table. I am actually not sure if this signal energy way of doing things is the best way to go, so I am open to suggestions, but having implemented the code as such, it would of course be convenient if it is possible to use it.

This may be the reason that the font names are unrecognizable in my systemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgqwQ8.png altfont viewerp  pActually I also try to solve this by trying to get the font with the messy font name. I tried codepycairocode after installing those fontsp  precodeimport cairo   adapted from  httpheuristically.wordpress.com20110131pycairohelloworld   setup a place to draw surface  cairo.ImageSurfacecairo.FORMATARGB32, 100, 100 ctx  cairo.Context surface   paint background ctx.setsourcergb1, 1, 1 ctx.rectangle0, 0, 100, 100 ctx.fill   draw text ctx.selectfontface ctx.setfontsize80 ctx.moveto12,80 ctx.setsourcergb0, 0, 0 ctx.showtext   finish up ctx.stroke  commit to surface surface.writetopng.gif codepre  pThis works well again with .ttf in JinWenDaZhuanTi.7zp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRIwku.png altenter image description herep  pbut still not with others. For example neither codectx.selectfontfacecode which reports codecairowin32scaledfontucs4toindexGetGlyphIndicesWcode nor codectx.selectfontfacesfcode which draws with the default font works. The latter name is the messy code displayed in the font viewer as shown above, obtained by a line of Mathematica code codeToCharacterCode[, CP950]  FromCharacterCodecode where codeCP950code is the code page of Big5.p  pSo I think Ive tried my best to tackle this issue, but still cannot solve it. Ive also come up with other ways like renaming the font name with FontForge or changing the system encoding to Big5, but I would still prefer a solution that involves Python only and thus needs less additional actions from the user. Any hints will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.p  pstrongTo the moderators of stackoverflowstrong this problem may seem too localized at its first glance, but it could happen in other languages  other encodings  other fonts, and the solution can be generalized to other cases, so please dont close it with this reason. Thank you.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Weirdly Mathematica can recognize the font name in CP936 GBK, which can be thought of as my system encoding. Take .ttf in ZhongGuoLongJinShiZhuan.7z for an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comL1f6z.png altMathematicap  pBut setting codectx.selectfontfacecode does not work either, which will create the character image with the default font.p

Negative 13829 pCurrently, the application displays an ImageView that successfully zooms and pans around on the screen.  On top of that image, I would like to provide a texture that I would like to update itself to zoom or pan when the image below it zooms or pans.p  pAs I understand, this should be possible with using the getImageMatrix of my current setup on the ImageView and then applying that to my textured bitmap that is on top of the original image.p  pstrongEdit amp Resolutionstrong with strong aide from the selected answer belowp  pCurrently, the panning in the texture occurs at a different speed than that of the ImageView, but when that has been resolved I will update this posting with additional edits and provide the solution to the entirety of the application.  Then only the solution and a quick problem description paragraph will remain. Perhaps Ill even post a surface view and renderer source code for using a zoomable surface view.p  pIn order to accomplish a mapping of an ImageView to an OpenGL texture, there were a couple of things that needed to be done in order to accomplish this correctly. And hopefully, this will aide other people who might want to use a zoomable SurfaceView in the future.p  pThe shader code is written below.  The glFragColor takes a translation matrix of a 3x3 from the getImageMatrix of any ImageView in order to update the screen from within the onDraw method.p  precodeprivate final String vertexShader          attribute vec4 apositionn          attribute vec4 atexCoordn          varying vec2 vtexCoordn          void main n            glPosition  apositionn            vtexCoord  atexCoord.xyn          n  private final String fragmentShader          precision mediump floatn          varying vec2 vtexCoordn          uniform sampler2D texturen          uniform mat3 transformn          void main n            vec2 uv  transform  vec3vtexCoord, 1.0.xyn            glFragColor  texture2D texture, uv n          n codepre  pAt the start, the translation matrix for the OpenGL is simply an identify matrix and our ImageView will update these shared values with the shader through a listener.  p  precodeprivate float[] translationMatrix  1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,                                      0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f,                                      0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f ... uniforms[TRANSLATIONUNIFORM]  glGetUniformLocationprogram, transform checkGlErrorglGetUniformLocation transform if uniforms[TRANSLATIONUNIFORM]  1      throw new RuntimeExceptionCould not get uniform location for transform  .... glUniformMatrix3fvuniforms[TRANSLATIONUNIFORM], 1, false, FloatBuffer.wraptranslationMatrix .... codepre  pHowever, the OpenGL code needs an inverse of the OpenGL matrix calculations that come from Android, as well as a transpose operation performed on them before they are handed off to the renderer for being displayed on the screen. This has to do with the way that that information is stored.p  precodeprotected void onMatrixChanged      ...     float[] matrixValues  new float[9]     Matrix imageViewMatrix  getImageViewMatrix     Matrix invertedMatrix  new Matrix     imageViewMatrix.invertinvertedMatrix     invertedMatrix.getValuesmatrixValues             transposematrixValues     matrixChangedListener.onTranslationmatrixValues     ...  codepre  pIn addition to the fact that the values are in the wrong locations for input into the OpenGL renderer, we also have the problem that we are dealing with our translations on the scale of imageHeight and imageWidth instead of the normalized [0, 1] range that OpenGL expects.  So, in order to correct with this we have to target the last column with divisible numbers of our width and height.p  precodematrixValues[6]  matrixValues[6]  getImageWidth matrixValues[7]  matrixValues[7]  getImageHeight codepre  pThen, after you have accomplished this, you can start mapping with the ImageView matrix functions or the updated ImageTouchView matrix functions which have some additional nice features when handling images on Android.p  pThe effect can be seen below with the ImageView behind it taking up the whole screen and the texture in front of it being updated based upon updates from the ImageView.  This handles zooming and panning translations between the two.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjHEbm.jpg altimageview updated opengl texturep  pThe only other step in the process would be to change the size of the SurfaceView to match that of the ImageView in order to get the full screen experience when the user is zooming in.  In order to get only a surfaceview shown, you can simply put an eminvisibleem imageview behind it in the background.  And just let the ImageTouchView updates change the way that your OpenGL SurfaceView is shown.p  pstrongVote up on the answer belowstrong, as they helped me offline through chat significantly to get to this point in understanding what needs to be done for linking an imageview with a texture.  They deserve it.p  pIf you do end up going with the vertex shader modification below, instead of the fragment shader resolution, then it would seem that the values no longer need to be inverted to work with the pinch zoom anymore and in fact work backwards if you leave it as is.  Additionally, panning seems to work backwards than is expected as well.p

Negative 13829 pIve searched but couldnt find a result for this that didnt involve XNA.p  pBasically, Im making a map editor using a C binding of SFML attached to a panels handle in my form. It runs at 550 FPS, which results in my main loop being called way too much, using too much resources 10 CPU for a small map editor.p  pI only really need 60 fps for this, and I know that will result in the cpu usage going down a lot.p  pDoes anyone know how to do this Ive heard that its impossible because WinForms s no function to access the graphic drivers VSync setting but there must be a way, rightp  pThanks.p
Negative 13829 pHere is the working java code to provide a base engine class which handles the balance listener registration, for a number of engine implementations used by various games.  e.g. there would be a demo engine which maintains a demo balance for a demo game and a cash version of the same engine which gets the balance from a back office etc.  The crux here is not the actual java, but how to implement this kind of pattern in JavaScript. i have tried about 30 different ways to do it, including using John Resigs simple JavaScript inheritance and the extend sugar defined in JavaScript The definitive Guide, using various module patterns, using thatthis etc. none of which worked for this problem.p  pHere is the working java codep  pstrongFile Engine.javastrongp  precodepackage com.test public abstract class Engine      BalanceListener externalBalanceListener  null     double balance  0     public void registerBalanceListenerBalanceListener balanceListener          externalBalanceListener  balanceListener         balanceListener.updatebalance   call once when first register          public double getBalance          return balance          protected void setBalancedouble newBal          if newBal  balance              balance  newBal             if externalBalanceListener  null                  externalBalanceListener.updatenewBal                                       public abstract double startGamedouble stake, int numLines  codepre  pstrongFile BalanceListener.javastrongp  precodepackage com.test public interface BalanceListener      void updatedouble balance  codepre  pstrongFile DemoEngine.javastrongp  precodepackage com.test import java.util.Random  public class DemoEngine extends Engine      public DemoEngine          setBalance10000          public double startGamedouble stake, int numLines          double wonAmount         Random random  new Random          setBalance getBalance  stake  numLines           some game logic         wonAmount  Math.roundrandom.nextDouble  10  stake         setBalance getBalance  wonAmount                   return wonAmount       codepre  pstrongFile DemoGame.javastrongp  precodepackage com.test  public class DemoGame       public class MyListener implements BalanceListener          public MyListener                  public void updatedouble balance              System.out.printlnnew balance   balance                    public static void mainString[] args          Engine engine  new DemoEngine          DemoGame demoGame  new DemoGame          BalanceListener balanceListener  demoGame.new MyListener          engine.registerBalanceListenerbalanceListener          engine.startGame10, 20       codepre  pHere was a plain failed attempt to get the same thing working in JavaScript see a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netfmX67 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netfmX67a p  precodefunction Engine      this.balance  0     this.externalBalanceListener      this.registerBalanceListener  functionl              this.externalBalanceListener l             this.externalBalanceListenerthis.balance           this.getBalance  function          return this.balance           this.setBalance  function newBal          if newBal  this.balance              this.balance  newBal             if this.externalBalanceListener  undefined                  this.externalBalanceListenernewBal                               function DemoEngine      this.startGame  functionstake, numLines          var won          setBalancethis.getBalance  stakenumlines         won  Math.roundMath.random  10  Stake          this.setBalancethis.getBalance  won          return won        DemoEngine.prototype  Engine  function DemoGame       function balanceListenerbalance          console.logbalance           var engine  new DemoEngine      engine.registerBalanceListenerbalanceListener  This throws an exception Uncaught TypeError Object [object Object] has no method registerBalanceListener      engine.startGame10, 25   var game  new DemoGame codepre  pObviously I have no idea what I am doing despite reading several JS Books.

Negative 13829 pIve got a codeUIWebViewcode which is displaying a long chunk of HTML with multiple embedded images that are wrapped in links.  The webview is scrollable so that content below the fold is accessible.p  pWhen the links are tapped, Im using the codewebViewshouldStartLoadWithRequestnavigationTypenavigationTypecode method to catch a specific JavaScript call, which then triggers a modal load of a UIViewController over the top of the webview.p  pAs soon as the link is tapped, the webviews codecontentOffsetcode is reset to code0,0code, so the page appears to jump back to the top. Ideally, Id like the webViews codecontentOffsetcode to remain where it is until the modal view controller is dismissed.p  pIve tried setting the codewebView.scrollView.scrollEnabledcode property to codeNOcode as soon as the codeshouldStartLoadWithRequestcode method is called  this doesnt stop the webView scrolling.p  pIve also tried saving the codecontentOffsetcode value at the point where the link is tapped, and then manually resetting it  but again, this doesnt stop the webView from scrolling.p  pIs there any way of preventing this scrolling from happeningp
Negative 13829 pI need to skip functions or breakout of a an async.series, and was wondering how I should go about it. I have an array of items that I need to iterate through. I put that list in a async.each function. Each item in the array then goes through a list of functions needed before moving on, in a series as info from one is needed in the next. But in some cases, I only need to go through the first function, then if a condition isnt met example, it is a category we dont use, then callback to the async.each loop for the next item.

Negative 13829 pMy original code passed a QStringList from the signal to the slot and then returned a QList.  Everything worked fine but I needed to change both the QStringList and QList into 2 different subclassed QObjects.  Since then I have been receiving errors like synthesized method first required here or it simply crashes without any error message.p  pI understand that qt copies all arguments passed in a queued connection and a qobject cannot be copied.  So instead of returning a qobject I thought I would create both qobjects prior to emitting the signal.  Then I would pass references to each object, modify one of them in the slot function and void the return value.  Unfortunately the app still crashes no matter how I code the signal and slot functions.  How can I code the signalslot functions and connect them to either pass both qobjects as arguments or return a qobjectp  precodeMyQObject1 obj1a,b,c MyQObject2 obj2 emit sendSignalampobj1, ampobj2  or MyQObject2 obj2  emit sendSignalampobj1  connectsomeObj, SIGNALsendSignalconst QObjectamp, this, SLOTreceiveSignalconst QObjectamp codepre  pThe receiveSignal function does not directly create or modify any qobject.  It has to pass the qobjects to another function first which then either modifies obj2 or creates and returns it.  Any code examples would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 13829 pI am having difficulty reducing the spacing between lines of text with CSS lineheight or height  Ive tried both.p  pI have a small bit of text and the spacing is off. Ive tried modifying the styles that appear to apply, and also enclosing the text in a codeltspangt...ltspangtcode and explicitly declaring the style. Nothing seems to work.p  pThe site isa Wordpress site using the Pagelines lite theme. The URL is a hrefhttpstage.dsthree.com relnofollowhttpstage.dsthree.coma and the issue is on the front page you can see it in the fourth column of text, just below the email subscribe box in the small text  the line spacing for that text is off. This site will not allow me to post a screenshot, as I am new here...sorry.p  pIve reduced the lineheight to 1 and to 1px to no effect.p  pAny help, directions or suggestions on how to reduce the whitespace is much appreciatedp
Negative 13829 pI have a data row with lots of dots, plotted as markers. Xaxis values range between 0 and 80 ms, and Yvalues take discrete values of 1,2,..5. There are about 50000 points, so if I just plot them as usual, the Yvalue changing dynamics is not clear, as you see for example a solid line forming at Y value 5, with a few dropouts at 3 and 4. I would like to modify my plot to zoom in the first millisecond  the half of the Xaxis should be occupied by the range 01ms, and the rest 180ms. Any idea how to achieve thisp

Negative 13829 pForgive me if Im asking too basic a question here Im not too experienced in R, but Im currently trying to plot some natural cubic splines in R and Im running up against a wall.p  pI have a data set which has 3500 rows and about 30 columns. This is a data set of singleseason baseball statistics for about 270 different baseball players over their entire careers. So basically, I have about 270 time series one for each player.p  pIm interested in player performance as measured by this thing called wOBA over time, so I want to fit a natural cubic spline to each and then overlay all the splines on one graph. And yes, it strongmuststrong be a natural cubic spline.

But when I try to run this loop, it takes forever. I checked the memory usage as this loop was running and it definitely ran out I am on a 4gb machine.p  pIm a little confused as to why this is. I would not have expected that fitting just 270 splines would cause R to completely use up 2gb free memory at the time of execution.p  pIm somewhat new to R, so Im sure Im missing something. Can anyone give any pointers Sorry if this is a completely boneheaded questionp

Negative 13829 pI have an application that is an addin to another commercial application and all of my code is in .NET 4.0.  A user is getting an error The invoke member is not supported in a dynamic assembly when a specific dialog is shown.

However there are two strange parts to my situation that I cant figure outp  ol liThis only seems to happen to them on 32 bit OS, not 64.li liThe dialog box is very simple, it has 1 enum, a couple properties, and a few event handlers.

After removing the EdmSchemaAttribute, I got a new errorp  pcodeAll SSDL artifacts must target the same provider. The ProviderManifestToken 2008 is different from 2005 that was encountered earlier.codep  pI googled and found suggestions that I should edit the 2005 .edmx file and change the 2005 to 2008. This resulted in a new error codeThe version of SQL Server in use does not support datatype datetime2codep  pSo as it turns out, one of the codedatetimecode columns in my SQL Server 2008 DB was actually a codedatecode column. For everything else, this made no difference, but codedatecode maps to codedatetime2code in EF, which caused a problem with the 2005 schema. I believe this maybe the root cause of the problem.p  pThe solution I used was to edit my 2008 .edmx file, change the 2008 to 2005 and change the codedatecode field to a codedatetimecode. The project compiled and ran without issue after this. p

With this solution, the toolbar it is not assumed to be part of the height of the keyboard, so additional code must be written to support proper insetting of content.li ul  pstrongNext proposed solutionstrongp  h2Use codeUIRespondercodes codeinputAccessoryViewcodeh2  pThis solution seems to be the way Apple intended to support this kind of behavior, as it solves all the shortcomings of manually animating the toolbar. But this solution completely misses the fourth requirement emwhen the keyboard is hidden, the toolbar stays docked at the bottom of the viewem.p  hr  pIt seems the solution is to use codeUIRespondercodes codeinputAccessoryViewcode, but somehow making the codeinputAccessoryViewcode not move below the view. Im looking for clean code to accomplish this. There are elaborate, almost noble, attempts elsewhere, but as mentioned, they do not meet the requirements.p  pIn my particular case, I am looking to use codeUINavigationControllercodes toolbar which entails additional issues as this is not intended behavior for codeUINavigationControllercode. No matter, Im willing to introduce some hacky fixes to accomplish that.p

Negative 13829 pI have made a class that creates a codeSortedDictionarycode and fills it with roster information, keyed by date and employee number. In the form class where the roster object is created, I need to get access to the roster lines stored in the codeSortedDictionarycode, to either display them, or print them to a file.p  pIs it possible to create a method in my class that returns a codeStreamcode so that the calling function can more or less access the data in the codeSortedDictionarycode as if it were a filep  pI looked at codeStreamReadercode and codeStreamWritercode, however these require file names in their constructors. I am more or less thinking of a logical file that is attached to the codeSortedDictionarycode and exposed as a stream that looks like a file. The benefit of a stream, as I understand it, would be that the calling function would not need to know the structure of the codeSortedDictionarycode, it could just read until EOF, making it simple to use. Would a codeMemoryStreamcode be applicablep
Negative 13829 pThis is probably a strange question...  Hopefully, someone enjoys the more esoteric portion of SQL.  p  pI have some views with many columns.  The column widths are obstructive to reviewing the data.  Once a column width is manually adjust and the view is saved, the column is perpetually saved at that width unless manually changed and again saved.  p  pThis makes me wonder how SQL saves column widths.  Is there a table containing that data  If so, could an updated query revise all the columns for a given table to a defined width  If so, howp  pJust FYI, my DBA and I spent a good while trying to figure this out.  I am not asking without first endeavoring to solve it myself.  I am a novice with SQL and hope for more experienced guidance.p
Negative 13829 pI have a setup that I havent been able to find a solution for.  Im setting up a load balancing solution between 2 different servers.  I would like each of these servers to have a local mongod instance so I dont increase load times by having one script connect to a remote database.p  pIve been looking into replica sets, but it looks like with that there always has to be a primary db, and thats the only one that has write privileges.p  pI would like both dbs to be primaries  meaning they will both have readwrite access, but I would also like them to autosync with each other every so often, so they both end up being clones of each other.p  pIs there any way to accomplish thisp
Negative 13829 pI was wondering if there were some gurus here who could help me with the following problem.p  pI have a Siemens S71200 PLC that I am accessing via HTTP and the builtin web server in the PLC. The PLC has been set up with a very simple web page that has two tags on it inside a HTML FORM so that the page can be loaded and new values for the tags written to the PLC.  This has been tested from a browser and works well.p  pThen I have a Java application which connects to the PLC 23 times each hour, loads the page with a GET, writes a new value into either tag field a value of 1 and then POSTs the page back to the web server.  This also works well.p  pHowever, before the page with the tag fields can be loaded, the HTTP client must log in with a userpass via another page in the PLC web server.  The Java application actually does this and then gets the tag page, updates a tag and posts the page.p  pThe problem is that this will run fine for weeks and then suddenly the web server will start returning error 500 during the login phasep  p500 INTERNAL SERVER ERRORp  pTurning the PLC off and back on makes everything start working again, but this is still not good because the PLC and Java app are supposed to ring a school bell on a certain schedule and when this problem occurs everyone will sit there waiting for it to ring, but it doesnt p  pNot a lot of info to go on, I know, I was mostly hoping someone else had had a similar problem and had some insight into why that occurred.  I am not a PLC expert so I dont know if there is a log or anything like that on the PLC that could be studied.p  pFor further info, I am using the Apache HTTP client library to talk to the PLC web server from the Java app.p  pThanks in advance,p  pHordur Thordarsonp

Negative 13829 pI have two NxN matrices that I want to multiply together A and B. In NumPy, I usedp  precodeimport numpy as np C  np.dotA, B codepre  pHowever, I happen to know that for matrix B only row n and column n are nonzero this comes directly from the analytical formula that produced the matrix and is without a doubt always the case.p  pHoping to take advantage of this fact and reduce the number of multiplications needed to produce C, I replaced the above withp  precodeimport numpy as np for row in range0, N     for col in range0, N         if col  n             C[row, col]  A[row, n]B[n, col]    Just one scalar multiplication         else             C[row, col]  np.dotA[row], B[, n] codepre  pAnalytically, this should reduce the total complexity as follows In the general case not using any fancy tricks, just basic matrix multiplication C  AB, where A and B are both NxN, should be ON3. That is, all N rows must multiply all N columns, and each of these dot products contains N multiplications  ONNN  ON3.p  pExploiting the structure of B as Ive done above however should go as ON2  N2  O2N2  ON2. That is, All N rows must multiply all N columns, however, for all of these except those involving B[, n] only one scalar multiplication is required only one element of B[, m] is nonzero for m  n. When n  m, which will occur N times once for each row of A that must multiply column n of B, N scalar multiplications must occur.p  pHowever, the first block of code using np.dotA, B is substantially faster. Im aware via information like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10442365whyismatrixmultiplicationfasterwithnumpythanwithctypesinpythonWhy is matrix multiplication faster with numpy than with ctypes in Pythona that the low level implementation details of np.dot are likely to blame for this. So my question is this How can I exploit the structure of matrix B to improve multiplication efficiency without sacrificing the implementation efficiency of NumPy, iwithout building my own low level matrix multiplication in cip  pThis method is part of a numerical optimization over many variables, hence, ON3 is intractable whereas ON2 will likely get the job done.p  pThank you for any help. Also, Im new to SO, so please pardon any newbie errors.p

Negative 13829 pI have a little problem understanding repositorydomain object relation. Here is some information I know about domain designthey may also be wrong or not accurate. And with these in mind, I cant find a way to obtain a domain object from the repository.p  pIn DDD the domain should know and contain only whats needed for the business and everything else must be cleared out of the domain. Thats fine. And also abstracting data access from any business is a good practice too. The application doesnt need to know where we store data or how we store data. We only ask the repository to give us a domain object and it gives us the object we want or the other way is valid too, we give the repository a domain object and it sends it to the storage.p  pDeclaring public setters for domain objects is also a very bad approach in object oriented design since we wont be able to control who is accessing what and changing what. So it is a good practice to expose only whats needed for outside of the object.p  pSo with these in my mind, I cant figure out a way to implement my repositories. I can use any ORM or pure sql in my code and retrieve data. p  pBut I cant create domain objects from persistence objects p  ol liSince they dont have public setters, I cant create and set the field values.li liDeclaring public constructors containing all of the fields doesnt seems right. I might have several models to fill in, this means I have to define several constructors with different sets of parameters.li ol  pAny help will be appreciated...p

Negative 13829 pI have been searching high and low for an option to force avcodec to use unaligned memory for its AVFrame data.p  pDepending on the pixel format, the horizontal planes of an AVFramedata may be padded with extra data to be aligned to memory for performance.p  peg a 1920  1080 video with 4 bytes per pixel will have 1920  4  7680 bytes per plane.p  pWith avcodec if you are decoding this video it will create 7808 bytes per plane.p  pThis adds 7808  7680  128 bytes of extra padding.p  pFor my purposes I would like to force avcodec to use unaligned data so I can copy an entire continuous chunk of frame data instead of copying and formatting smaller pieces one at a time to a continuous chunk.p  pThe following flag found in the headersp  precode encoding support    These flags can be passed in AVCodecContext.flags before initialization.

One for the normalstate, one for the MouseOverState and the last one for the isClickedstate. The problem now is everything is working except the isCklicked state. I know how to solve it but not exatcly how to realize it... the problem is that the button should do its clickevent after i released the left mouse button, not by clicking it... so there will be enough time for the icClicked animation and it will stop doing the clickevent as long as the button is clicked, because this makes it hard to choose a option to be eiher on or off...p  pSo i just need a way to tell the game to stay ready when the button is clicked and only playing the click event after releasing the button, if you know what i mean. p  pSo, any idears p  pPS Sorry for my bad english but i hope i could tell you my problem in an understandable way p

Negative 13829 pMy questions are motivated by a C code which is not mine and that I am currently trying to understand. Nevertheless, I think this question can be answered by OO developers in general because I have ever seen this case in Java code for example.p  pReading through the code, I noticed that the developer always work using side effects most functions have void return type except for getters and some rare cases instead of returning results directly. He sometimes uses return values but only for control flows error code... instead of exceptions.p  pHere are two possible examples of his prototypes in pseudocode For a function that should return min, max and avg of the float values in a matrix Mp  precodevoid computeStatisticsfloat min, float max, float avg, Matrix M codepre  pORp  precodevoid computeStatisticsList myStat, Matrix M codepre  pFor a function that should return some objects in a given list that verifies a certain criteria and the number of objects foundp  precodeint controlValue findObjectsList result, int nbObjectsFound, Object myCriteria, List givenList codepre  pI am not familiar with C as you can probably see in my verypseudocode... But rather with Matlab where it is possible to return everything you want from a function for example an int and a List side by side which could be useful for the second example. I know it is not possible in C and that could explain the second prototype but it doesnt explain the choice for the first example where he could have donep  precodeList myStat computeStatMatrix M codepre  pFinally, here are my questions What are the possible reasons that could motivate this choice Is it a good practice, a convention or just a development choice Are there advantages of one way over the other returning values vs. side effects wayp

Followinf is the default configuration generated by netbean7.3.1 i.e. when you add new Spring project netbean generate its own xml and other files that usually run but even that one is not running. It happend suddenly since yesterday.p  pI am getting following exceptionp  precodeexception  javax.servlet.ServletException java.lang.AbstractMethodError

Negative 13829 pProblem statement Im using PySystemState to invoke my jython module in java class and execute some methods on it. Now the problem is that my jython module has some dependencies on some other jython modules located in paralled directories in the same jython project. And as a result when I invoke the target module it throws import exception saying dependent module cant be located.p  pStructure of my jython projectp  precodejythonproject   src      folder1lthas the module which is invoked from javagt      folder2 lt it has the modules which the module inside folder1 imports with statemet from folder2 import x codepre  pException  No module named folder2p  pPlease note that in java project Im setting up JYTHONPATH env variable with path to both folder1 and folder2.p  pIm using eclipse environment with jython 5.3.p  p2  some more research  Im using PySystemState to invoke jython modules from java. Here is the spec to load the module and class.p  precode  Constructor obtains a reference to the importer, module, and the class name  public JythonObjectFactoryPySystemState state, Class interfaceType, String moduleName, String className       this.interfaceType  interfaceType      PyObject importer  state.getBuiltins.getitemPy.newStringimport      PyObject module  importer.callPy.newStringmoduleName      klass  module.getattrclassName      System.err.printlnmodule  module  ,class  klass   codepre  pNOw it seems that Im importing only the module in folder1 and then getting the class inside it to invoke methods. Now since this module has imports from other modules which are located in folder2 and they are not loaded in java code hence it fails to located the module.  Now the question is how should I load dependent modules in folder2 along with the module in folder1 which I need.p  pGuys I noticed one more thing the module in folder 2 which is imported in module which Im invoking from java doesnt have a class in it. So module which Im invoking from java has a class which Im invoking and that class has dependency on a jython module which has some methods but its not a class. By any chance is this the reason why its not working and Im getting an exception.p  pTried few other things and here is the outcome Scenario 1         pkg1 has module1 with class1        pkg2 has module2 with class2 And module 1 has an import  from module2 import class2 Now when I invoke class1 from java program this works fine.p  pScenario2        pkg1 has module1 with class1        pkg2 has module2 which has method definitions and no class And module 1 has an import  from pkg2 import module2 Now when I invoke class1 from java program this throws me exception.p  pConclusions 1 we cant use imports from package when invoking a jython class from java. 2 we cant invoke a jython class from java which has imports from a module which doesnt have a classjust method definitions. Because jython will only allow from pkg import  in this scenario and again well have problem as in point 1.       p

Negative 13829 pThis is more of a general code structuring question.p  pAt the moment I try to write my code into namespaces. So for example, I would havep  precodeMine.FancyPlot.Plot... Mine.FancyPlot.Impl.PlotCanvas... Mine.FancyPlot.Impl.PlotLegend... Mine.BasicPlot.Plot... Mine.BasicPlot.Impl.PlotCanvas... Mine.BasicPlot.Impl.PlotLegend... Mine.BasicPlot.Impl.PlotLines... codepre  pThe idea is that I am trying to hide away private functions in a Impl for implementation namespace. So outside of codeMineFancyPlot.Rcode I wouldnt call codeMine.FancyPlot.Implcode functions.p  pThis approach works reasonably well, except code completion isnt as nice as it could be.p  pTo begin with, when I type codeMine.BasicPlot.code and hit codeTABcode, I get all functions, including the codeImplcode functions, and because codeIcode is before codePcode, they even hide the public user functions.p  pSo I started changing the structure to p  precodeMyPub.FancyPlot.Plot... MyPriv.FancyPlot.PlotCanvas... MyPriv.FancyPlot.PlotLegend... MyPub.BasicPlot.Plot... MyPriv.Mine.BasicPlot.PlotCanvas... MyPriv.Mine.BasicPlot.PlotLegend... MyPriv.Mine.BasicPlot.PlotLines... codepre  pThis works better in that private functions are no longer predicted. However, I still have the issue that if I type codeMyPub.code and hit codeTABcode, I cant actually see all different namespaces such as I would in codeJavacode, codeCcode, ..., but rather a long list of functions starting all in the first namespace.p  pIdeally, Id like code completion in codeRcode to cut off all predictions at the next dot, and unique them, so Ideally when I type codeMyPub.code and hit codeTABcode, I would only get a list of subnamespaces and functions in codeMyPubcode.p  pIs this possible Can the code prediction be altered to reflect this behaviour Or is there a better way to achieve what I am aiming forp

Negative 13829 pbHow can I mount a tar.gz archive transparently with Pythonbp  pI have a tar.gz archive whose contents have to be read by an external program. The contents will only be needed temporarily. I could just unpack it to a temporary folder and point my external program there to read it. Afterwards, I could just delete the temp folder again. However, the archives may be large 1 GB when extracted so that unpacking them will take up a lot of space on the disk. My server is rather weak regarding HD performance and I cannot waste space ad lib but it does have a lot of RAM and CPU power.p  pThats why I want to try to mount the archive transparently without unpacking it entirely. I came across a hrefhttplinuxaria.comhowtohowtomountsanarchiveforaccessasafilesystem relnofollowarchivemounta which seems to do exactly what I want. bIs there a way to do what archivemount does in pure Pythonb No subprocess.call solutions, please. It should run on 64bit Linux.p  pI believe there should be a smart way to use a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2librarytarfile.html relnofollowtarfilea to access archives contents   and then a hrefhttpsgithub.comterencehonlesfusepy relnofollowfusepya to create a userspace file system which exposes the contents of the archive. Has anyone already put these pieces together Any ideasp  pIf you think that this is not a good idea, please post relevant comments. If you know what is better, please comment.p
Negative 13829 pI just want to understand exactly how connections and queries behave with MySQL Proxy.p  pI have two backend servers both running identical MySQL installations, set up in a mastermaster config which seems to be functioning perfectly. I.e. I can manipulate tables and data on one, and the changes are instantly reflected on the other, and vise versa.p  pI have installed MySQL Proxy on a separate machine with the backend servers specified in the command line in my batch file.p  pI can access my database via Workbench using the address of the proxy.p  pMy question is how and what is delegated to each server It states in the a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.0enmysqlproxyusing.html relnofollowdocumentationa that the proxy splits up the clients using roundrobin I assume that just splits requests equally. Does that mean the actually PDO connections that are made get shared out or is it the queries that are being sent to itp  pIf its the later, does it break up subqueries too If it isnt, then do I need to recode my more complex SQL statements to take advantage of the clientconnection splittingp  hr  pA simple example of how I think a query would need to redone would bep  precodeSQL  SELECT id FROM mytable LIMIT 1000 codepre  pWould be much more involvedp  precoderesults  array for10ilt1000i     conn  new thisgtdbconnect     r  conngtprepareSELECT id FROM mytable WHERE id       rgtexecutearrayi     arraypushresults, rgtfetch     conngtclose  codepre  pOr is that just madness Would the extra overhead be more than negated by the fact that the requests are being split between the servers Or would it be much slower than doing it the conventional wayApologies for any code errors as that was off the top of my head.p  pI know LIMIT isnt id, its just a simple example.p

Negative 13829 pIve been learning about the various ways of content optimization for websites for months now, however Im still confused about whats the right way of doing so e.g. which emoptimization workflowem results in what effects.p  pstrongASP.NET MVCstrong provides its own optimization framework through the emMicrosoft.Web.Infrastructureem package. With that, I can define bundles and minification strategies directly in code on request or when the application starts. However, since my style files are written in emlessem, I need to compile them beforehand, which might slow down the overall application start process, so I feel it might be better to compile those during the build process of the application.

Note that this only happens for the scenario I outlined above. Pressing back if you havent deleted a cell from the table doesnt crash the app, nor does moving forward directly after you have deleted a cell, doing anything in between deleting the cell and pressing the back button will cause the app not to crash. Any advice on how to track down the cause of this issue would be appreciated.p  pEDIT I think my problem might be how Ive implemented this methodp  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView commitEditingStyleUITableViewCellEditingStyleeditingStyle forRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath       If the tableView is asking to commit a delete command...     if editingStyle  UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete           Remove the image from the store         [[SFMImageStore sharedCache] deleteImageAtIndex[indexPath row]]           Reload the table         [tableView reloadData]           EDIT Adding this forces the tableView out of editing mode     [tableView setEditingNO]  codepre  pI tried commenting out code[tableView reloadData]code just to see what happens, and predictably, the cell is still present in the table because it hasnt been reloaded. What surprised me though, was that the delete button was also still there. That is what led me to believe that perhaps what Im doing here might be to blame.p  pEDIT Forcing the table to exit editing mode stops the message from printing I should have done that to begin with anyway, but its still strange that the tableView would get a reloadData message when dealloc is called.p

Negative 13829 pI want to insert all rows of an SQL server Table into a Bigquery Table having the same schema. The streaming insert row by row is very slow to insert 1000 rows the execution of the code below took about 10 minutes.

Negative 13829 pIm looking at creating a model that can be enhanced with additional plugins.  The core model would only introduce some fairly fundamental types.  For example an asset management system could define a basic model in plugin A that would define assets, suppliers etc.  An additional plugin B would add a number of specializations for computer equipment and another plugin C would bring in specializations for something else.p  pId like my application to have a single model, with plugin B and C creating their specialized instances and adding them to the model in residing in plugin A. Is this possible, all the documentation I can find seems concerned with extending a model but creating an instance of that, not mixing and matching.  If it matters, objects would only be created in the plugin that defines that type.p  pAdditionally Id like other plugins to enrich the data model, e.g. a fault management plugin D could add data to the objects to hold fault status.p  pIs this achievable with EMF  p  pI had thought that if it is not possible to do this directly that I could possibly achieve the required result by chaining the model objects by having them implementing IAdpatable, but having a single model seems better. p

Negative 13829 pIm using Spring Boot to create a simple web application which accesses a database. Im taking advantage of the autoconfiguration functionality for the DataSource by setting up codespring.datasource.code properties in codeapplication.propertiescode. That all works brilliantly and was very quick  great work guys  Spring p  pMy companys policy is that there should be no clear text passwords. Therefore I need to have the codesping.datasource.passwordcode encrypted. After a bit of digging around I decided to create a codeorg.springframework.boot.env.PropertySourceLoadercode implementation which creates a jasypt codeorg.jasypt.spring31.properties.EncryptablePropertiesPropertySourcecode as followsp  precodepublic class EncryptedPropertySourceLoader implements PropertySourceLoader      private final StandardPBEStringEncryptor encryptor  new StandardPBEStringEncryptor      public EncryptedPropertySourceLoader              TODO this could be taken from an environment variable         this.encryptor.setPasswordpassword            Override     public String[] getFileExtensions              return new String[]properties           Override     public PropertySourceltgt loadfinal String name, final Resource resource, final String profile throws IOException              if profile  null                      final Properties props  PropertiesLoaderUtils.loadPropertiesresource              if props.isEmpty                              return new EncryptablePropertiesPropertySourcename, props, this.encryptor                                return null       codepre  pI then packaged this in its own jar with a codeMETAINFspring.factoriescode file as followsp  precodeorg.springframework.boot.env.PropertySourceLoadercom.mycompany.spring.boot.env.EncryptedPropertySourceLoader codepre  pThis works perfectly when run from maven using codemvn springbootruncode. The problem occurs when I run it as a standalone war using codejava jar myapp.warcode. The application still loads but fails when I try to connect to the database as the password value is still encrypted. Adding logging reveals that the codeEncryptedPropertySourceLoadercode is never loaded. p  pTo me this sounds like a classpath issue. When run under maven the jar loading order is strict but once under the embebed tomcat there is nothing to say that my custom jar should be loaded before Spring Boot.p  pIve tried adding the following to my pom.xml to ensure the classpth is preserved but it doesnt seem to have had any effect.p  precodeltbuildgt     ltpluginManagementgt         ltpluginsgt             ltplugingt                 ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt                 ltartifactIdgtmavenwarpluginltartifactIdgt                 ltconfigurationgt                     ltfailOnMissingWebXmlgtfalseltfailOnMissingWebXmlgt                     ltarchivegt                         ltmanifestgt                             ltmainClassgtstartclassltmainClassgt                             ltaddClasspathgttrueltaddClasspathgt                         ltmanifestgt                     ltarchivegt                 ltconfigurationgt             ltplugingt         ltpluginsgt     ltpluginManagementgt     ltpluginsgt         ltplugingt             ltgroupIdgtorg.springframework.bootltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtspringbootmavenpluginltartifactIdgt         ltplugingt     ltpluginsgt ltbuildgt codepre  pDoes anyone have any ideas Thanks in advance.p  pbUPDATEbp  pA step forward Ive managed to fix this by having the codeEncryptedPropertySourceLoadercode class implement codeorg.springframework.core.PriorityOrderedcode interface and returning codeHIGHESTPRECEDENCEcode from codegetOrdercode.

Negative 13829 pIm fairly new to TFS, coming from a a CVS and Subversion background, with some Git and Mercurial influences. I find that I am often fighting with it because it doesnt compare the state of your working copy on the filesystem with that in version control. Instead, it shows you what it emthinksem is the file system state, based on what youve done in Solution Explorer and Visual Studio.p  pFor example, if you delete a file in Solution Explorer and, later, replace the file in some other tool usually Windows Explorer TFS will insist that the file is deleted. Further more, it will detect the replacement and suggest it as an Add but it wont let you promote that because the Add conflicts with the delete. There is no easy way to resolve this because you cant undo the delete either  you cant undo a delete if the file is physically still present on the file systemp  pThis, in my opinion, is a disaster. Why cant it just forget what you have previously done in Solution Explorer and show you the current state i.e. the file has merely changed or remains unchanged.p  pSimilarly, if you edit a file in Visual Studio and subsequently edit it to undo those changes, TFS insists that the file has been modified, sometimes, even if there are no effective changes  the committed revision is identical to the new one after your changes.p  pIs there any way to break this link and disable tracking of you actions inside Visual Studio  i.e., when you refresh Pending Changes, it looks at the current state of your working copy on the File System and diffs THAT with the head revisionp

I know I can solve it using a quadratic algorithm, but it wont meet the requirement of the assignment. Can some one give me any ideas on how I can achieve thisp  pHere is note my teacher provided.p  pNote About Testing You will need to develop several sets of test collections for testing your algorithm. The grading rubric mentions covering the case where all the test collections have the same length, as well as covering the case where the test collections are of different lengths. You will also need to think about what constitutes the worst case scenario for this algorithm, since only that scenario will make your analysis of total comparisons performed a meaningful one. You can use the formulas in the grading rubric to tell you how many comparisons you should expect in the quadratic and linear cases. For example, if you have 5 total collections 1 query collection and 4 test collections, each of which contains 10 elements, the total number of comparisons performed in the worst case should be k  1N2, which for k  10 and N  10 is 5  1102, or 400 comparisons. For the linear algorithm, you should only have Nk  1, which is 105  1, or 40 comparisons.p

Specifically, either an assertion failure or BADACCESS occurs on calling dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier under the circumstances mentioned above, i.e. when, with a search active, you segue from one of the cells in the results table to another view and then segue back again.p  pNow, I can stop the error occurring by just callingp  precode     UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      MyCell cell  MyCell  [self.tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierMyId] ... codepre  pwithout passing in the indexPath. This then works without an error as such, but on segueing back to the table view with search results, a weird display issue occurs whereby layered underneath the search results, there appear to be the separators of a ghost table, almost as though the system is trying to render one table directly on top of another but cellForRowAtIndexPath emisntem being called for each table, only for the search results table as expected.p  pI get the same problem whether the segue is attached to the cell or table view controller so in the latter case, I implement didSelectRowAtIndexPath to manually trigger the segue.p  pSo a can anyone point to something I might be doing wrong to cause these issues, or b point to a barebones working example of a table view controller with UISearchBar where the table cells segue to another view Im surprised Im getting so many issues as implementing a searchable table with detail views must be a common, boring thing that people do all of the time, nop  pstrongSample project exhibiting the iussestrong a hrefhttpwww.javamex.comDLTableTest.zip relnofollowhttpwww.javamex.comDLTableTest.zipap

Negative 13829 pId like to preface this by saying that until now, I hadnt even HEARD of SAML, much less developed a SSO strategy involving it.  That, combined with the fact that Ive barely been doing node for a year makes for a glorious newbie sandwich.  Currently, I have a client who uses SAML and ADFS as their SSO provider.  I am already using passport.js for local logins, so using passportsaml seems to be the way to go to implement the SSO using SAMLADFS.  In doing my research, Ive found a couple different implementation guides, but since I literally know NOTHING about this process, I could use a few pointers.  p  pIn the passportsaml documentation, I found the following for a strategy proven to work with ADFS according to the docsp  precode   entryPoint httpsad.example.netadfsls,   issuer httpsyourapp.example.netlogincallback,   callbackUrl httpsyourapp.example.netlogincallback,   cert MIICizCCAfQCCQCY8tKaMc0BMjANBgkqh ... W,   identifierFormat null  codepre  pI suppose my main question is where does this cert come from  Is this a cert I generate on my server via SSL  Does the provider provide itp  pIn my searching, I have also found this a hrefhttpsgithub.comauth0passportwsfedsaml2 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comauth0passportwsfedsaml2a, which is based on passportsaml.  The following configuration is suggested for ADFSp  precode   path logincallback,   realm urnnodeapp,   homeRealm ,  optionally specify an identity provider    identityProviderUrl httpsauth10dev.accesscontrol.windows.netv2wsfederation,   cert MIIDFjCCAf6gAwIBAgIQDRRprj9lv5 ...   codepre  pIn this example, the path object is obvious, and my provider has already given me an providerURL.  But realm makes no sense to me, and theres that darn cert again.p  pCould someone provide me with an explainlikeimfive way of implementing SAMLADFS SSO in a node.js site  Or help me make heads or tails of the argument objects requested by the two solutions Ive outlined  Much appreciated in advancep

For examplep  precodeVisualComponent myControl  new BorderDecoratornew ScrollDecoratornew TextView codepre  pcreates a text view control that is scrollable and has a border. Adding a border is invisible to the client  its a private method code[2]code and its called in the codeDrawcode method from the codeVisualComponentcode interface.p  pHowever, in the example the authors also presented in the diagram a method for scrolling the GUI control code[1]code. Now, theres nothing more mentioned in the book so I dont know what exactly that method is supposed to do or how it is supposed to behave. Most importantly, I dont know whether its public and part of the classs interface or private.p  pAssuming its the latter case, how would it work The only methods defined by the codeVisualComponentcode interface are codeDrawcode and codeResizecode, none of which really applies to the task of scrolling the control usually by clicking and dragging a mouse by the user. Ive marked possible invocations with code[3]code but Im not sure theyre right.p  pAssuming its the former case, the method extends the classs interface with a new public method and thats the gist of my question. How is the client supposed to call that method If its not the toplevel decorator like in our example it cant access the codecomponentcode field as its private.p  pSo, to summarize  can the decorator classes add new strongpublicstrong methods If so, how are these supposed to be called If not in which case they can only add new strongprivatestrong methods, should these methods strongextend the behaviour of the object ONLY in a way which fits the behaviour defined in the component interfacestrong codeVisualComponentcode in our case For example, if the component interface only defined a codeDrawcode method, should these new private methods only deal with drawingappearancep

Negative 13829 pIm trying to implement a collectdplugin, which is supposed to report data for multiple instances of a serverprocess on the same machine.p  pMy TYPECONFIGfunction is fine  it gets each configurationitem and parses it.p  pWhat Im struggling with is the TYPEREADfunction  Id like each invocation of the reader to report only on emoneem of the serverinstances so that, should an invocation fail for one instance, the rate, with which collectd invokes the method for emotherem instances, is not affected.p  pSo I tried to register multiple TYPEREAD methods from inside the TYPECONFIGmethod.p  pUnfortunately, collectd does not pass any arguments to the readmethod... One alternative is to build a list of instances in config, register only one reader, and then loop through the list inside it  this works but has the drawback mentioned above should one instance fail to report its stats, the daemon will lower the inquiry rate for all instances.p  pThe other alternative emmayem be to use Perls anonymous functions  but Im not sure, how. The below does not workp  precode    my data  [minstance, connection]     pluginregisterTYPEREAD, foo, sub  return mongoreaddata  codepre  pCollectd rejects such a call with codeCollectdpluginregister Invalid datacode.p  pIs there, perhaps, some easy way to create such a function in a way acceptable to pluginregisterp

Negative 13829 pIm making an iOS app with Core Bluetooth. My device has a central role and several other iOS peripheral devices have a handful of characteristics. A peripherals characteristics include 1 Read, 2 Notify and a Write. Im running into an Invalid Handle error for the Read characteristic in the codedidUpdateValueForCharacteristiccode delegate callback. If I ignore the error and display the characteristics value, it works fine. However, when I go to write to the Write characteristic, I get a Handle is invalid error in the codedidWriteValueForCharacteristiccode delegate callback. I cant simply ignore this error because Ive verified that peripheral Im writing to does not actually get written.p  pI know I can solve this problem by manually resetting the Bluetooth on either of the iOS devices peripheral or central. And, I dont know how to systematically recreate this bug.

Negative 13829 pIm developing a website where I used number inputs to get a reservations duration, by asking the user to specify the start and end time of it. Id like to limit the input fields in a way that doesnt let the user choose an earlier end time than start time, and vice versa. I managed to do this with javascript, but in this way you need to increment the end time value in order to be able to increment the start times value, and I dont think this is a good practice. For example, if the first fields value is 8, and its limited to be lesser, than the seconds value, which is 9, Im not able to increment the first number inputs value as long as I dont increment the second ones.p  pSo, I would like to control the first input fields increment event or whatever its called so I can also increment the second input fields value, when the firsts value is exactly equal with [seconds value  1]. I know theres not much support for this type of input field yet, but however, is there any way to do thisp  pstrongEditstrongbr codemax  parseIntendtime.value, 10  1  min  parseIntstarttime.value, 10  1  starttime.setAttributemax, max  endtime.setAttributemin, mincodebr This is the javascript code to limit the two number input fields. But unfortunately I couldnt write any code that increments the second fields value when I increment the first one, or lowers the firsts value when I lower the second one. I couldnt find any examples or information about what event fires when I press the updown arrows of number input fields.p

There are many ways to scrape data off the Internet, I just used Casperjs to test out its capabilities.I checked with the bank and they say as long as its my bank account, its no problem.p  pHeres the technical problem Im having to deal with the bank limits the number of login to  40 a day. Should the number of logins go above that. It will lock me out of my account for 6 hours.

Negative 13829 pMany tables in my database have common fields which I call audit fields.  They fields like  UserUpdateId, UserCreateId, DateUpdated, DateCreated, DateDeleted, RowGUID, as well as a common Comments table etc.  In the database they are used to track who did what when.  Additionally via the asp.net MVC 4 views they display these attributes to the user using common display templates popup, mouseover etc..p  pCurrently, I put these properties into a  [Serializable] CommonAttributesBase class. Which I then initialize in all the models that should inherit those properties.

Negative 13829 pthanks in advance for any input. I have been trying to write a program that interprets a serial command into text change in a label. I can change the label text easily with an Action attached to a button, but for some reason all my attempts at changing the label text outside that button action result in nothing being changed. p  precode  MasterViewController.m     Created by Daniel Payne on 22815.

Negative 13829 pI have a Python application which uses both SQLite and Postgresql. It has a connector class for each databasep  precode class PostgresqlDatabaseDatabase      ...    class SQLiteDatabase      ... codepre  pBoth class share the same methods and logic, and the only thing that differentiate them the SQL is the parametrization of SQL queries. Most of the SQL queries are even identical, e.g. both have a method called codegettagcodep  precode  postgresql method with s  def gettagself, tagcipher     sqlsearch  SELECT ID FROM TAG WHERE DATA  s     self.cur.executesqlsearch, [tagcipher]     rv  self.cur.fetchone     return rv   sqlite method with  def gettagself, tagcipher     sqlsearch  SELECT ID FROM TAG WHERE DATA       self.cur.executesqlsearch, [tagcipher]     rv  self.cur.fetchone     return rv codepre  pTo really make it clear, the classes have exact identical method names. The SQL queries differ in each method. So what is my problemp  pI find maintaining both classes annoying, and I feel a common class would benefit the code in the long run.  However, creating a common class, would create a complex code.  The codeinitcode would probably have to initialize the correct underlying cursor. This would create a small starting overhead, and small performance penalty if for example I would lookup the correct string every time, e.g. p  precode property   def sqlsearchself      return SELECT ID FROM TAG WHERE DATA  .format            if self.db  SQLite else s    def gettagself, tagcipher      self.cur.executeself.sqlsearch, [tagcipher]     rv  self.cur.fetchone     return rv codepre  pI am also afraid this approach would be also harder to understand when first looking at it. p  pLeaving my personal example, I would like to know what is the most acceptable way here. Should I keep maintaining both classes or write one more complicated class that does it all  p  pIs there a general rule of thumb p
Negative 13829 pHello We are trying to create a custom template system based such as WPF Header and Footer elements, with a canvas for 2D Drawings for export to PDF. The problem is the XpsWriter takes about 7 seconds to write the XPS Document, and another 3 Seconds to convert to pdf with PDFSharp.  We need to get this down as the user waits for the PDF.

Negative 13829 pSo this is more of a conceptual architecture question. Im making a messaging app in iOS. Devices can send image messages. I am saving custom codeMessagecode objects which include images to disk using codeNSCodercode protocol. I want to remove the messages from memory when I dont need them i.e. when the user logs out and disappears from users list view. I am appropriately encoding that users messages to disk, and loading them when the user reappears. However, on the messaging view a dynamic codeUITableViewcode where each cell displays the message content, the image content of the messages are cached within the codeUIImageViewcode subview.p  pSo, I am essentially creating duplicates of the images when I load the messages from disk. Every time a user logs out and then in i.e. disappearing and then reappearing, the associated messages are saved and then loaded from disk recreated objects, and my memory usage creeps upward once I go to the private message view and scroll all the way up in order to display all messages.p  pUltimately, I want to clean the cache of message images so that I can free up memory when a user is no longer around. I have a good reason for saving messages locally my question is what is the best design for saving messagesimages to disk, removing them from cache memory, then reloading them when I need to populate a dynamic codeUITableViewcode p

Negative 13829 pI have a Xinetd service running on CentOS 6. One of the Xinetd services I configurate is running on port 5901 a VNC SERVER. This VNCSERVER is XDMCP. So every time a user connects to 5901 see the login Xwindow.p  pAlso I am running XRDP.  My XRDP redirects to port 5901. That means that when I am connecting to port 3389 I am redirect to login Xwindow.p  pThis is working. My question isp  pIs there anyway that when the user connects 3389 port write their credentials not have to write it again in the login XWindow   Using pam modules maybep  pIt does not make sense to write twice the user and password for my users.  p  pI do it in that way because I have another port running on xinetd recording vnc sessions. So everytime someone connects to port 3389 XRDP will start running my vnc record video.p
Negative 13829 pstrongTLDR  The classes I need to use to allow my server to remain secure prevent my client remaining secure  I cant find a happy balance.strongp  pI am using codeHttpsUrlConnectioncode on android devices which are not readily accessible to humans. They run for long periods of time without being rebooted  long enough that sometimes they need to adapt slightly to a changing server. In this scenario, a security flaw shows up in the wild and the server is reconfigured to reject the vulnerable protocol.p  pAs far as I can make out, the android device is caching the connections in some way that means once it has decided on a protocol for a server it sticks with it, even if the server starts rejecting connections. I would like it to go through the handshake again, get a new protocol, and keep working.p  pI emthinkem I can see how to do that using a custom socket factory.p  pHowever, I am also aware of security flaws showing up in the codeSSLcode implementation on the device.  I can fix these using codeProviderInstallercode, which updates whatever it is that needs updating using the google play store.  Ignoring for now the dialog I have to deal with when I do that, I also hit on this little warningp  blockquote   pCaution Updating a devices security Provider does not update android.net.SSLCertificateSocketFactory. Rather than using this class, we encourage app developers to use highlevel methods for interacting with cryptography. Most apps can use APIs like HttpsURLConnection, HttpClient, and AndroidHttpClient without needing to set a custom TrustManager or create an SSLCertificateSocketFactory.p blockquote  pI might be misreading this, but I get the feeling that the only way I can deal with a server changing protocols to protect itself from a vulnerability is to use things which make the client unsafe insteadp  pCan anyone confirm, clarify or offer suggestionsp

They worked out for the most part, but I was unable to cast my enum elements to int values. I included a example of a section of code that was giving me problems below.p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecode    foreach T val in bloodTypeValues              sum  intval  This line is the problem.      codepre  pI have also tried using Enum e as a method parameter.

Negative 13829 pI searched for this before asking but couldnt find anything that helps. I have a server that uses UTC, the clients can set the time of an event that the server executes daily this is a simplification. For example someone in France wants an event to happen at 2300 local time 2200 UTC. I convert this to UTC and store it the server executes happily every day at 2200 UTC. Then come summer, now the offset is 2h with France, the server still executes at 2200 UTC but for the user this is the wrong time as 2200 UTC in France is now 0000 local time.p  pI store in UTC because everyone says to store in UTC and to convert to the local time when outputting to the user, fine, but this doesnt work as expected for the user. I think I should store something like 2300 French time and the server should take that and say ok, this is 2200 UTC today  or ok, this is 2100 UTC today because of DST I am using Java with JodaTime BTW, but this contradicts what everyone says about how I should be storing it in UTC in the DB...so...what canshould I dop  pIf I store the local time and date with offset and when I read it on the server which is using UTC I dop  precodeDateTime dbLocalHistoricDateTime  fromDB  suppose this 2300 in France on the 01.01.2015 UTC1, 2200 UTC on that date DateTimeZone localZone  dbLocalHistoricDateTime.getZone DateTime currentLocalDateTime  DateTime.now.withZonelocalZone DateTime localToday  dbLocalHistoricDateTime.withDatecurrentLocalDateTime.getYear, currentLocalDateTime.getMonthOfYear, currentLocalDateTime.getDayOfMonth DateTime utcToday  localToday.withZoneDateTimeZone.UTC codepre  pthen utcToday contains the correct UTC time for today 2100 UTC being 2300 in France on the 27.04.2015, the server then can execute this event on that UTC time.p  pThanks, Gabrielp

Negative 13829 pRecently I made a function that reads some mails when Outlook is getting closed. This function was created into a specific Module and the Function is being called when Outlook is getting closed. p  pSince the CloseQuit event cant be called in the Module itself as far as I know I created the event in ThisOutlookSession of the user. p  pIt looks like thisp  precodePublic Sub ApplicationQuit     ReadMails End Sub codepre  pThe ReadMails is the sub which handles the Reading of the mails obviously. So when a user exit his outlook this function gets executed and they get a message of it. p  pThis worked great at the initial user account where I implemented it. p  pThough, I also had to use this function and quit event on another User. So I copied the OTM Project to the other user first I changed the old OTM of that user to .prv.otm and then pasted it in there. The code seems to be copied perfectly as well as the code in ThisOutlookSession which gets copied to ThisOutlooKSession of the other user. p  pWhen testing it however the ThisOutlookSession code never gets executed at the second user account, it just doesnt launch the quit event on quitting outlook.. p  pHow is this possible since it did work at the first user account And how could I fix it p  pWhen debugging my application at the second user it seems to work fine no errors. To bad I cant debug the event itself  what happens when exit is being clicked.  p

I fit the image to the Image View using p  precode     self.selectPhoto.contentMode  UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit      NSLayoutConstraint topConstraint  [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemself.topLayoutGuide attributeNSLayoutAttributeBottom relatedBy0 toItemself.selectPhoto attributeNSLayoutAttributeTop multiplier1 constant10]      NSLayoutConstraint bottomConstraint  [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemself.selectPhoto attributeNSLayoutAttributeBottom relatedBy0 toItemself.caption attributeNSLayoutAttributeTop multiplier1 constant35]      [self.view addConstrainttopConstraint]      [self.view addConstraintbottomConstraint]      self.selectPhoto.image existingImage codepre  pIt works great.   Because the UIImageView is set up using AutoLayout, and the UIImage is shown using Aspect Fit, I do not know the exact frame of the image.  I want the upper left hand corner of the image to be at 0,0 in the image view because I have another smaller image which the user can move around on top of it.   img srchttpi.stack.imgur.coml31ip.png altImage 1p  pFor example  Because of the orientation of the waterfall image the upper left hand corner is 0,23ish in the UIImageView.  When the image height  image width the origin of the image view is 66,0.  This is a problem because I want to then draw the user context of both images and save as a new image. I cant do this because I dont know where the 2 Months image is placed on the waterfall image because I dont know the origin of the waterfall image.  I know where the 2 Months image is on the image VIEW, but the image doesnt take up the entire imageView.  Because of the AutoLayout and Aspect Fit it differs depending on the sizeorientation of the image.  I added the 2Months Pan gesture to the waterfall image view, but the origins dont line up.  The code for the pan gesture which is attached to the 2Months view is as follows p  precodevoid handlePanUIPanGestureRecognizer recognizer      CGPoint translation  [recognizer translationInViewself.view]     recognizer.view.center  CGPointMakerecognizer.view.center.x  translation.x,recognizer.view.center.y  translation.y     [recognizer setTranslationCGPointMake0, 0 inViewself.view]     self.itemToEdit.stickerLocation recognizer.view.frame     NSLogThe location of the sticker is f and y is f, recognizer.view.frame.origin.x, recognizer.view.frame.origin.y  codepre  pIs there a way to fit the UIImageView to the actual displayed UIImage  Basically I want to do something like  codeself.selectPhoto.frame  self.selectPhoto.image.framecode  Which I cant do. p  pIn summary  How do I know the absolute origin of my imageView after it has been placed using AutoLayout and Aspect fitp

Negative 13829 pIm working on a webbased music sequencertracker, and Ive noticed that in my sample playback routine, audio contexts seem to exist only for the duration of of a sample, and that the Web Audio API doesnt seem to adjust playback duration when I pitchshift a sample. For instance, if I shift a note down an octave, the routine only plays the first half of the sound before cutting off. More intense pitch downshifts result in even less of the sound playing, and while Im not sure I can confirm this, I suspect that speeding up the audio results in relatively long periods of silence before the sound exits the buffer.p  pHeres my audio playback routine at the moment. So far, a lot more work has gone into making sure other functions send the right data to this than into extending the functionality of this routine.p  precodefunction playSoundbuffer, pitch, dspEffect, dspValue, volume   var source  audioEngine.createBufferSource   source.buffer  buffer source.playbackRate.value  pitch   Volume adjustment is handled before other DSP effects are added. var volumeAdjustment  audioEngine.createGain source.connectvolumeAdjustment Very basic error trapping in case of bad volume input. ifvolume gt 0 ampamp volume lt 1       volumeAdjustment.gain.value  volume   else  volumeAdjustment.gain.value  0.6   switchdspEffect     case lowpass         var createLowPass  audioEngine.createBiquadFilter         volumeAdjustment.connectcreateLowPass         createLowPass.connectaudioEngine.destination         createLowPass.type  lowpass         createLowPass.frequency.value  dspValue         break     There are a couple of other optional DSP effects, but so far they all operate in about the same fashion.  source.start codepre  pp  pMy intent is for samples to play back fully no matter how much pitch shifting is applied, and to limit the amount of pitch shifting allowed if necessary. Ive found that appending several seconds of silence to a sound works around this issue, but its cumbersome due to the large amount of sounds I would need to process, and Id prefer a codebased solution. p  pEDIT Of the browsers I can test this in, this only appears to be an issue in Google Chrome. Samples play back fully in Firefox, Internet Explorer does not yet support the Web Audio API, and I do not have ready access to Safari or Opera. This definitely changes the nature of the help Im looking for.p

Negative 13829 pFirst Id like to mention that my programming experience and knowledge are very limited. Id appreciate it if you could answer my question with actual code that I can simply copy and paste.p  pI am writing a plugin for QGIS in Python 2.7 using PyQt4 to create the GUI.br Im using a for loop to create paired rectangles in a QGraphicsScene. Every iteration gives one pair of rectangles. Now I want to access these rectangles outside of the for loop, but all the rectangles on the left side are called rectL and all on the right are called rectR. Is there a way to add a variable number to their names I want to call the first pair rectL1 and rectR1, the second pair rectL2 and rectR2 and so on or something along those lines.br I hope my question is clear enough. A link to a screenshot of the QGraphicsScene as seen in QGIS and the relevant parts of the code I think are below.

Negative 13829 pI am working in spreadsheets with lots of data that are sent over to a C program. The problem comes into play when the macro runs too fast for the C program. I am looking for a possible solution with VBA. Currently using AppActivate to open the program and SendKeys to input the data. p  pAfter doing some research, looking at shell and wshshell, none of these seem to quite fit what I am looking for, unless I am missing something. The problem comes in to effect when I have had the macro send all the values to fill out the window, then click save, using SendKeys Enter. Is there a way to write in VBA, after I send that Enter click, to wait for the process to finish and then loop through again to insert more datap  pCurrently I have a Sleep for over 2000 milliseconds to cover the majority of the time that it might take, although I still come into problems from time to time, depending on the server at that moment. While that is helpful, I want to be able to shorten the time it runs, when the server is working well.p  pIs there a way to have the macro wait when the C program is taking a minute to save the data before moving on to the next set of data to receive from excel p
Negative 13829 pIts a little bit complicated.I got a .net class library project form someone else and added it in my solution referenced by a asp.net mvc project. For some reason I changed the project name form abc to xyz and also Assembly name, Default namespace name in project properties page. I could build the solution and get the xyz.dll in the bin folder. The problem is I cant run the web application because of the error Compiler Error Message CS0433. I looked into the folder CWindowsMicrosoft.NETFrameworkv4.0.30319Temporary ASP.NET Filesroot and found out the abc.dll still there and I checked the file detail information on properties page. The file description and product name are the same xyz, but the original filename is still abc.dll. I really dont know whats going on here. I wish some could help me out,Thanks in advance.p

Negative 13829 pIn my WPF application I have a codeTabControlcode with three codeTabItemscode. Each codeTabItemcode has a codeItemsControlcode inside which codeItemsSourcecode is bound to an codeObservableCollectioncode in a Viewmodel. If I open the first and second codeTabItemcode, CPU usage is lt10. But when I open my third codeTabitemcode the CPU usage increases up to 70 and I dont know why. p  pMy first thought was, that data binding causes this. So i removed any binding from this codeTabItemcode. But even if the third codeTabItemcode has no content nor code which is called, the CPU usage is still high. If I switch back to the first and second codeTabItemcode, the CPU usage goes back to normal.p  precodeltTabControl Grid.Row1gt         ltTabItem HeaderTab1 IsSelectedTruegt             ltGridgt                 ltGrid.Backgroundgt                     ltLinearGradientBrush EndPoint0.504,1.5 StartPoint0.504,0.03gt                         ltGradientStop Colorf0f0f0 Offset0 gt                         ltGradientStop ColorDBFFDF Offset1 gt                     ltLinearGradientBrushgt                 ltGrid.Backgroundgt                 ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                     ltRowDefinition Height5 gt                     ltRowDefinition Height60 gt                     ltRowDefinition Height5 gt                 ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                     ltColumnDefinition Width5 gt                     ltColumnDefinition Width175 gt                     ltColumnDefinition Width15 gt                     ltColumnDefinition Width70 gt                     ltColumnDefinition Width5 gt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                 ltBorder Grid.Column1 Grid.Row1 HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch BackgroundF0F0F0 BorderBrushDarkGray BorderThickness3gt                     ltScrollViewer IsDeferredScrollingEnabledTrue HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityAuto VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAutogt                         ltviewOverview gt                     ltScrollViewergt                 ltBordergt                 ltBorder Grid.Column3 Grid.Row1 HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch BackgroundF0F0F0 BorderBrushDarkGray BorderThickness3gt                     ltScrollViewer IsDeferredScrollingEnabledTrue HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAuto HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityAutogt                         ltItemsControl ItemsSourceBinding OverviewElementCollectiongt                             ltItemsControl.ItemsPanelgt                                 ltItemsPanelTemplategt                                     ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontal gt                                 ltItemsPanelTemplategt                             ltItemsControl.ItemsPanelgt                         ltItemsControlgt                     ltScrollViewergt                 ltBordergt             ltGridgt         ltTabItemgt          ltTabItem HeaderTab2gt             ltScrollViewer IsDeferredScrollingEnabledTrue VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAuto HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityAuto VerticalAlignmentStretch HorizontalAlignmentStretchgt                 ltTabControl ItemsSourceBinding TabItemCollection gt             ltScrollViewergt         ltTabItemgt         ltTabItem HeaderTab3gt             ltGridgt                 ltGrid.Backgroundgt                     ltLinearGradientBrush EndPoint0.504,1.5 StartPoint0.504,0.03gt                         ltGradientStop Colorf0f0f0 Offset0 gt                         ltGradientStop ColorDBFFDF Offset1 gt                     ltLinearGradientBrushgt                 ltGrid.Backgroundgt                 ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                     ltRowDefinition Height5 gt                     ltRowDefinition Height60 gt                     ltRowDefinition Height5 gt                 ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                     ltColumnDefinition Width5 gt                     ltColumnDefinition Width175 gt                     ltColumnDefinition Width15 gt                     ltColumnDefinition Width70 gt                     ltColumnDefinition Width5 gt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                 ltBorder Grid.Column1 Grid.Row1 HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch BackgroundF0F0F0 BorderBrushDarkGray BorderThickness3gt                     ltScrollViewer HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityAuto VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAutogt                     ltScrollViewergt                 ltBordergt                 ltBorder Grid.Column3 Grid.Row1 HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch BackgroundF0F0F0 BorderBrushDarkGray BorderThickness3gt                     ltScrollViewer IsDeferredScrollingEnabledTrue HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAuto HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityAutogt                         ltItemsControl ItemsSourceBinding ErrorOverviewElementCollectiongt                             ltItemsControl.ItemsPanelgt                                 ltItemsPanelTemplategt                                     ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontal gt                                 ltItemsPanelTemplategt                             ltItemsControl.ItemsPanelgt                         ltItemsControlgt                     ltScrollViewergt                 ltBordergt             ltGridgt         ltTabItemgt     ltTabControlgt codepre  pSo I hope you can help mep
