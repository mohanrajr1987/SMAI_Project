Negative 849 pHere is the situation. This small company Im working with wants to have a redundant internet access. They run bunch of services from their office  a website, POPSMTP server and use VPN for accessing network shares from home. They have 2 independent internet connections from 2 ISPs one is a local cable provider, and another one is a DSL. If their default connection goes down, they switch to the backup.p  pUnfortunately way they are set up right now they have to change their DNS records every time this happens which means every switch results in at best few hours of downtime. They want to be completely redundant, and be able to switch between networks without the downtime. How can that be accomplishedp  pWould it be possible to set up a server in a remote data center, point the DNS at it and have it forward the network traffic to the correct IP p  pIf this was just a web application, Id set up a basic server and use a 301 redirect or something like that. I dont really care if it has to be switched manually each time because they have a dedicated IT person or two on the staff who could do it. But they also need their POP, SMTP and VPN traffic redirected this way.p  pSo its almost like load balancing, but not really. Are there existing solutions that would provide this functionality How would you provide ISP redundancy like thatp

Negative 849 pI have a web app where users can upload files. The files are physically stored by IIS in a virtual folder that is mapped to an external storage device.

I would like the administrative task to run outside IIS as a scheduled task or windows service.

Negative 849 pI have an app that runs on Windows Mobile and uses the GPS to update its location at various intervals.  As expected, enabling the GPS chip uses more battery power.  no duh..p  pSo currently my technique has been to cycle the the GPS onoff at approx. every 4 minutes to acquire the location, do something if things changed, and update its location to the web only if necessary.  Otherwise, shut it off again and wait.p  pOn my one year old HTC Touch Diamond phone, with a fresh charge, leaving the screen ON but dimmed,  WiFi, and doing nothing else but letting it sit there, I got a maximum of 6 hours from it.p  pThis is ok, but the usage of the GPS easily cuts an estimate of 24 hours of regular realworld usage YMMV.p  pThe other option Ive simply been emthinkingem about is to have the web server instead signal the phone to update its location when needed, instead of the phone just doing it blindly.p  pThat way, the phone only uses power to get a data connection and check the server.  If the server tells it to update, only then does it turn on the GPS.p  pExcept that the response time of that is much slower Im guesstimating, and if the phone is somewhere it cant readily get a stable update, then you wont even know its last location.  At which point, youre stuck waiting.p  pI was hoping the phone could be more autonomous.p  pIs there possibly yet a better algorithm I could use to improve this setupp  pThanks.p

Negative 849 pI am using mootools to create a CSS skin for the Youtube chromeless player using the javascript API to control playback. I cannot post the code unfortunately. The question I have is a more general one. When using the slider plugin a call to mySlider.setstep moves the knob to the correct step on the slider but it triggers all of the plugins event functions onChange, onTick, onComplete. The problem with this is, how do you know if the sliders knob position was changed by a user or a call to the set function I would have thought there would be a function reserved for when the knob was released by a mouse only and not be called if the position was simply set in code. I have code that updates the knobs position based on where the videos playback duration is currently at. I need to be able to move the knob to the current position in code without it thinking a user let go of the knob.p  pTo simplify the question, is there a way to set the knobs position on a slider in code without triggering the functions used when a user interactsp  pYou can find the Slider plugin reference here a hrefhttpmootools.netdocsmoreDragSlider relnofollowhttpmootools.netdocsmoreDragSliderap  pThanksp

Negative 849 pI need some expert advice on strong typed data sets in ADO.NET that are generated by the Visual Studio. Here are the details. Thank you in advance.p  ul lipI want to write a Ntier application where Presentation layer is in Cwindows forms, Business Layer is a Web service and Data Access Layer is SQL db.pli lipSo, I used Visual Studio 2005 for this and created 3 projects in a solution.pli lipproject 1 is the Data access layer. In this I have used visual studio data set generator to create a strong typed data set and table adapter to test I created this on the customers table in northwind.  The data set is called NorthWindDataSet and the table inside is CustomersTable.pli lipproject 2 has the web service which exposes only 1 method which is GetCustomersDataSet. This uses the project1 librarys table adapter to fill the data set and return it to the caller. To be able to use the NorthWindDataSet and table adapter, I added a reference to the project 1.pli lipproject 3 is a win forms app and this uses the web service as a reference and calls that service to get the data set.pli ul  pIn the process of building this application, in the PL, I added a reference to the DataSet generated above in the project 1 and in forms load I call the web service and assign the received DataSet from the web service to this dataset. But I get the errorp  blockquote   pCannot implicitly convert type   PL.WebServiceLayerReference.NorthwindDataSet   to BL.NorthwindDataSet eMy   DocumentsVisual Studio   2008ProjectsDataSetWebServiceExamplePLForm1.csp blockquote  pBoth the data sets are same but because I added references from different locations, I am getting the above error I think. p  pSo, what I did was I added a reference to project 1 which defines the data set to project 3 the UI and used the web service to get the DataSet and assing to the right type, now when the project 3 which has the web form runs, I get the below runtime exception.p  blockquote   pSystem.InvalidOperationException   There is an error in XML document 1,   5058.

Negative 849 pIve a general design questionbr  br  I have a mailserver, written in C.br  Then I have a web forum software, written in for ASP.NET in C.br  br  Now Id like to integrate the mailserver into the ASP.NET forum application. For example, Id like to make it possible that one can create a mailinglist from the forum, and give users the oportunity to add oneselfs to the mailinglist members in the forum, and then add the new listmembers to the respective mailinglist on the server.p  pSince the server is a separate consolewinformsservice application, I first thought Id best use .NET remoting for this.p  pBut my second thought was, that some users might host their forum on a host where br  a they dont have a virtual machine where they can do what they wantbr  b the admin of the host might not want to install an additional mailserver or charge extra for thisbr  c the user might have a service plan that only permits to add a webapplication, not external programs very likelybr  br br  Now, I wanted to askbr  Is it possible to fully integrate a mailserver into an ASP.NET application somehow  I have the full source of the server  ASP.NET applicationp  pWell, it probably wont be a page or a ashx handler, but something like a http module  Or whats the general way to integrate TCPIP applications into asp.net  Of course Im assuming the respecive ports are availableforwarded  and Ill make it possible to also run it with the email server as external applicationp

Negative 849 pHitting a wall with this one, hope someone can lend a hand.  I have a wrapper div containing many fixedwidth content divs.  Its like a table, except that the number of items per row arent fixed, so that whenever the screen size is wide, more items fit onto the screen.  Pretty basic.  p  pAlso, each of these content divs has an adjacent details div that is hidden by default styledisplaynone, and an adjacent separator div that is empty, containing only the style clearboth.  p  pEach contentdetailsseparator div has a unique number in its ID, so that I can tell they are related e.g., content123, details1234, separator1234p  pNow, when one of these content divs is clicked, I want to reveal its details div below it.  That part, Ive got working partially, by wrapping an anchor tag around the content div, which fires an onClick javascript event, which in turns runs a jQuery statement to make visible the details and separator divs codejQuery.details1234.cssdisplay,blockcodep  pBut you can imagine my problem.  Once that separator div is reveled, it pushes down clears any content divs that appears to the right of it, ugly.  My thought, what I have been wrestling with for hours, is to reveal the separator div of the content div, that is the last one appearing in the row that was clicked.  That way, a new row will be opened up by the separator, so that when the content div is revealed it appears below the clicked item in the new row. To do that, I need to figure out the elementID of the last content div in the row, and I was thinking about using the Ycoord of the mouse click event, plus the Xcoord  to the rightmost edge of the wrapper div minus half the width of the fixedwidth content div. Something like that.  But I am smashed into a wall and cant figure it out.p  pCan anyone help me do that  Or offer a different solution If sample code would help let me know, I could whip up an example, but it may take some screen space in this post.p  pThanks everyone.. going nuts with this.p  pEDIT  the sample code below is based on my site.  When a cell is clicked, you can see its details div appear below it, but unfortunately the other divs in the row get pushed down.  that is the effect Im trying to avoid.  When a cell is clicked, I want the details to appear below it, but also the other divs to stay in their positions above the other cells details, basically I want to keep the row intact.  In the code, you can see my fruitless experiments using a separator div, because my assumption is that if I can insert that after the last div in the row, then the details div will become the next row, followed then by the next row of cells.

Negative 849 pIs there any programming language to do graphical layout for semiconductor manufacturing So far I am using LEdit, an expensive and rudimentary CAD program. As my design is composed of hundreds of identical cells with only small variations, creating the design programatically sounds like the way to go.

At the moment, I am giving the designer a list of the sample sizes I need, he draws them, I check them, and then enter them manually into my wafer mapping software. Output format needs to be dxf or better gerber. The program needs the capability to output many different layers. I had a look at pgftikz, and the programming language side is more than enough for the application, but the output is somewhat limited no gerber, no layers etc.. In addition, I need very good resolution down to nanometers, I havent tested that yet.p  pAny other recommendation for a graphics programming language, or library, for wafer layoutp

The App Server too is using codeminpoolsizecode and codemaxpoolsizecode  100 in codemysqlds.xmlcode and codemysqlrods.xmlcode.p  pIm simulating a load of 100 virtual users from a regular, singlecore PC. This is a 1.8GHz  1GB RAM box. p  pThe application is deployed and being used on a 100 Mbps ethernet LAN.p  pIm using rendezvous points in sections of my stresstesting script to simulate realworld parallel and emnotem concurrent use.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pThe CPU utilization on this loadgenerating PC never reaches 100 and memory too, I believe, is available. So, I could try adding more virtual users on this PC. But before I do that, I would like to know 1 or 2 fundamentals about concurrencyparallelism and hardwarep  ol lipWith only a singlecore load generator as this one, can I strongreallystrong simulate a parallel load of 100 users with each user using operating from a dedicated PC in reallife My empossibly incorrectem understanding is that, 100 threads on a singlecore PC will run concurrently interleaved, that is but not parallely... Which means, I cannot really simulate a realworld load of 100 parallel users on 100 PCs from just one, singlecore PC Is that correctpli lipNetwork bandwidth limitations on user parallelism Even assuming I had a 100core loadgenerating PC or alternatively, lets say I had 100, singlecore PCs sitting on my LAN, wont the way ethernet works permit only concurrency and not parallelism of users on the ethernet wire connecting the loadgenerating PC to the server. In fact, it seems, this issue of absence of user parallelism will persist even in a realworld application usage with 1 PC per user since the user requests reaching the app server on a multicore box can only arrive interleaved. That is, the only time the multicore server could process user requests in parallel would be if each user had her own, dedicated physical layer connection between it and the serverpli lipAssuming parallelism is not achievable due to the above issues and only the next best thing called concurrency is possible, how would I go about selecting the hardware and network specification to use my simulation. For example, a How powerful my loadgenerating PCs should be  b How many virtual users to create per each of these PCs c Does each PC on the LAN have to be connected via a switch to the server to avoid broadcast traffic which would occur if a hub were to be used in instead of a switchpli ol  pThanks in advance,p  pHSp

Negative 849 pIs it possible to switch from HiLo to GUID.comb As far as I can tell, the latter combines the advantage of HiLo, namely managing Ids clientside instead of needing a call to the DB for getting a new Id, with the advantage that its impossible to run out of Ids.p  pCurrently we are running into problems with HiLo generating Ids so big, that Int32 this should have been Int64, but thats more of a WTF of my predecessor isnt big enough.

Negative 849 pI have a Rails 3 based CMS that allows users to create and modify layouts and views.  These layouts and views are the same ones built into the framework, only backed by a model for some additional capabilities.  The problem I would like to address is that these template files are cached as soon as they are accessed on the public end, so it is not possible to see changes in the layouts or views unless the server is restarted.  This does not occur in development mode where caching is disabled, but obviously turning off template caching in production wouldnt be great for performance.  Clearing memcache doesnt seem to do the trick.  Is it possible to programatically clear out the layouts and views cache in production, perhaps with something like reload like we have in the console  Or am I stuck having to restart Passenger every time someone wants to tweak one of these layouts or views perhaps using the approach in this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2847859railscacheclearingRails Cache Clearingap  pPlease note that I am not referring to clearing the page and action caches, which the public pages rely on and works just fine.  p

Negative 849 pIm writing an Ant script to do some a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6211202writingabuildscriptforaplayframeworkapplicationadditional checksa on my Play Framework Application.p  pCurrently, I am executing my tests from my Ant script by simply making an exec call to play autotest.p  precode    ltexec executableplay.dirplay.batgt         ltarg lineautotestgt     ltexecgt codepre  pWould anyone know how to integrate Clover into a Play test suite  Obviously I am not tied to having to run my tests using the above.p  pI also tried writing the Ant script using the traditional way of executing JUnit tests i.e. using Ants codejunitcode target and I got two problemsp  ul liWhen executing all my tests, only the first would execute successfully while the others would fail for strange reasonsli liIf I just expose one test in my suite and have the test run successfully, it would say I have code coverage of 0.  I then thought I set up clover incorrectly, however, I created a simple class that tested a production class that did nothing and the coverage went up as I would expect.li ul  pSo if I were to go down the codejunitcode route, I would need to know how to execute all my tests so that they can run one after another successfully it works when using the Play way of running codeplay autotestcode and I would need to know why Clover does not seem to pick up lines of code touched by Play tests.p  pI know there is a Cobertura module for Play, however, I find that Clover does a better job telling me an accurate coverage figurep  pbUpdate bUnfortunately I am unable to replicate the exact error I was getting before as I have run into compilation issues when I try and compile things manually.  Ive started to use the Secure module and it only contains Java source files.  So in my Ant script, I call codeplay precompilecode which produces the byte code for the Secure module as well as everything else in the system including my code.  So now when I try and compile my app code using Clover, I think the compiler gets into a bit of a tangle as I have two versions of my classes  one produced by the precompile command nonclover and one produced by my own ant compilation with cloverp  precode[javac] Cprojectstestprojectoutcloverclassesclover8583527041716431332.tmpmodelHouseTest.java45 incompatible types [javac] found    play.db.jpa.JPABase [javac] required models.House [javac]         CLR25115y15ygoxiz3dv.R.inc1527House found  House.findByIdid codepre  pSo I essentially have two problems nowp  ul liI need to be able to compile my source code that also depends on Play provided modules e.g. CRUD, Secure which do not have compiled versions hence my attempt at getting around it by calling codeplay precompilecode myself in my Ant scriptli liOnce I get compilation working, I will undoubtedly have my original issue again of not being able to execute the tests using the codejunitcode target. li ul  pbUpdate 2 bIt turns out that the error I got was due to the codefindByIdcode call required a cast from JPABase to House not that the IDE or play seemed to care about it.  So after I went in and put a cast for all of plays find methods, I actually got JUnit and Clover reports  iHowever...i I am now getting two kinds of errorsp  ul lipEntity classes created in Play can be created by extending the codeModelcode class which provides magic methods such as those codefindcode methods mentioned before as well as the codecountcode method.  The Model superclass actually extends GenericModel which implements those methods by throwing an UnsupportedOperationException.  So obviously Play does some more magic behind the scenes to provide actual implementations of these methods.  Unfortunately, my tests and production code rely on methods such as count but they are throwing the exception in my antjunit scenario note everything works fine when running codeplay autotestcode.pli lipThe other error I am getting is due to the fact that I use the Spring module.  In one of my classes the root class, I call codeSpring.getBeanOfTypeSome.classcode.  Now I use autoscanning, but in the antjunit testing environment, the Spring module has yet to set up my spring container and therefore the call just returns null.pli ul  pI have a feeling there is one magic fix that will resolve both of my issues however I am unsure what that magic fix is.p

Negative 849 pI normally work in emacs with the frame split into two sidebyside windows. Committing a change via git codeCx v vcode opens a buffer in the other window for the change comment. The problem is that when I finish the comment and type codeCc Cccode, the window containing the comment is killed along with the VClog buffer. Then I have to split the frame into two windows again and find the buffer that had been in deleted window.p  pIs there any way to keep this process codeCx v vcode [commit message] codeCc Cccode from messing up my window layout Id be happy for the VClog to open in the other window and then disappear without changing the window layout, or for the VClog to temporarily split one of the windows, as long as my original bufferwindow layout is restored when Im done with the commit. I could write a wrapper function for codevcnextactioncode that saves and restores the window configuration, but it seems like there should be a more straightforward way to do this. Any ideasp

Is there any way that when the game is open on a tab, that all keyboard input apart from  and the various browser operator keys will will be capturable without having to have the user click on a specific spot on the screen. Ive a very limited experience with HTML, and only need a cone of answer as I am building the game in python in a way that it builds itself into HTML.p  pI am also using a timed loop, and need to be able to have an onkeypress event to be capturable inside the timed loop.   p  pWhich element should I use Which properties of the element p

Negative 849 pWe have two webservers running with nginx  php5fpm configuration native php sessions on a memdiskp  pThe webservers are using different subdomains and loadbalancing is somehow satisfied.  Now we want to use the same domain address for these servers and even newer ones with the exact same configuration.p  pInstalling an nginx in front of these web servers does not sound as a good idea since there are many file uploads to these web servers and the datatraffic passing through the loadbalancer for each upload would cause unnecessary traffic. Round robin DNS solution needs sessions shared in memcache, redis or db. This is also what we do not like because we keep too much data in sessions and very fine with it in our memdisks on local.p  pAre there any other configurations that fit to our needsp

Negative 849 pIm currently evaluating the combination of jQuery Mobile and PhoneGap. For my application, I need a kind of inner application navigation model A fixed header that contains elements to switch between various contexts and functions, and the entire region below that depends on whatever function is selected. An example The user selects a customer and can then switch between different data and statistics views concerning that customer. Alternatively, the user can switch between different customers while keeping the same view. Each function  view might again be a rather complex construct of multiple pages with its own navigation.p  pI think I understand the basic ideas of jQuery Mobile by now, but Im unsure how to implement this the right way. p  ul liI could do this simply by coding the entire header with the navigation into every single page, but that feels like a really bad idea  lots of redundant code, lots of places to insert tiny mistakes that are very hard to find.li liI could try to add all the UI elements for the different views to a single page, hide them and only display the ones that belong to the current function. This doesnt feel right either  I suspect that the DOM would be really large and I suspect that this might cause various performance issues.li liI could try to create the contents of the page that depend on the function dynamically using jQuery DOM manipulation techniques. This sounds like a good idea, but the individual pages can be really complex, and Im worried that generating lots of complex HTML code using JavaScript will lead to an unmaintainable blob of code.li liI could try to combine the approaches  code the individual pages in the HTML file and then somehow link them into the appropriate place using DOM manipulation  but Ive never done that and Im unsure if and how I can get this working.li liI could try to put the detail page into an iframe  would this work at allli ul  pWhat is the best  canonical way of implementing this kind of application Do you know of any tutorials or examples p

Negative 849 pI have a web page with a tiny space for users to submit some comments.  just one line of text and a button.  if they use it, after pressing the button I have a bit of javascript which disables the button and thanks them. p  pThe next bit is how to send their comment to the server. p  pThe way I have done it is the following p  pin the javascript which handles the submit I create a new javascript like thisp  precodevar script  document.createElementscript script.src  usercomment.jscommentValue document.body.appendChildscript  codepre  pI dont have any usercomment.js script so the call fails silently.

In my global header I allow the user to change the language of the site, which the code is sitting in the home controller, to modify the localization information for the site.

I did have RedirectToActionindex at the end of the localization code. p  pWhat I would like to do is from whatever controller I am on, call the set localization routine, and return the SAME page and controller that they are currently on, without redirecting them somewhere specific.p  pAny ideas Thanks in advance.p

Negative 849 pWe are about to implement a bunch of OpenSocial gadgets. They are not going to be run on Facebook or any other social network but rather on our own internal Apache Shindig server.

However, if any error occurs in the JS code, Visual Studio will open a view on the JS code and mark the erroneous line. Once that view is open, we can use it for setting break points, too. Live editing is not possible though because the original JS file only gets merged into the XML in the course of the build process.li liOn the other hand, if we include the plain HTML file as an iframe instead of having Shindig render it, we gain the possibility of liveediting and debugging directly in the respective files. But of course all of the Shindig features are not effective. In particular, all the scripts automatically added by Shindig are missing or have to be included by hand.li ul  pIdeally every change in the HTML or JS file while running the application in debug mode would immediately update the merged Gadget XML file, thus allowing life editing even when using Shindig.p

Negative 849 pIm confused on how Overriding differs from Hiding in Java. Can anyone provide more details on how these differ  I read the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavaIandIoverride.htmlJava Tutoriala but the sample code still left me confused.p  pTo be more clear, I understand Overriding well. My issue is that I dont see that hiding is any different except for the fact that one is at the instance level while the other is at the class level.p  pLooking at the Java tutorial codep  precodepublic class Animal      public static void testClassMethod          System.out.printlnClass   method in Animal.          public void testInstanceMethod          System.out.printlnInstance    method in Animal.       codepre  pThen we have a subclass catp  precodepublic class Cat extends Animal      public static void testClassMethod          System.out.printlnThe class method   in Cat.          public void testInstanceMethod          System.out.printlnThe instance method   in Cat.           public static void mainString[] args          Cat myCat  new Cat         Animal myAnimal  myCat         Animal.testClassMethod         myAnimal.testInstanceMethod       codepre  pThen they sayp  blockquote   pThe output from this program is as followsp      pThe class method in Animal.p      pThe instance method in Cat.p blockquote  pTo me, the fact that calling a class method testClassMethod directly from the Animal class, executes the method in Animal class is pretty obvious, nothing special there. Then they call the testInstanceMethod from a reference to myCat, so again pretty obvious that the method executed then is the one in the instance of Cat.p  pFrom what I see what the call hiding behaves just like overriding, so why make that distinction. If I run this code using the classes abovep  precodeCat.testClassMethod codepre  pIll  get emThe class method in Cat.em But if I remove the testClassMethod from Cat, then Ill get emThe class method in Animal.emp  pWhich shows me that writing a static method, with the same name as in the parent, in a subclass pretty much does an override.p  pHopefully Im making clear my where Im confused and someone can shed some light.  Thanks very much in advancep

Negative 849 pIm building a custom OpenGL control which consists of a list of items where each item may be a different class, but inherited from a certain common class type. I dont know how to do this in a way where I can do a loop through these items and perform certain actions which are expected to be overridden in the inherited classes.p  pTo be more specific, this is a list of visual objects which are meant to be drawn to a canvas. I have a common class codeTGLItemcode which is used to create a number of inheritance classes. For example, codeTGLCarcode is inherited from codeTGLItemcode and is added to the list codeTGLItemscode. This custom list class is part of the control.p  pWhen the control draws, it does a loop through this item list and calls the codeDrawcode procedure of each item. codeDrawcode is intended to be overridden by the inheritance classes where the actual drawing of the item occurs. So the real work is done from the codeDrawcode procedure which is implemented in the codeTGLCarcode class but it is only called from the main control.p  pThe main control codeTGLImagecode shall have no knowledge of what the actual inherited item is, but be able to call its codeDrawcode procedure expecting it to draw to OpenGL.p  pHow do I structure this item list and item base in a way to accommodate for this scenario Heres what I have so farp  precode  TGLItems  classTPersistent   private     FItems TList     function GetItemIndex Integer TGLItem     procedure SetItemIndex Integer const Value TGLItem   public     constructor Create     destructor Destroy override     procedure AddAItem TGLItem     function Count Integer     property Items[Index Integer] TGLItem read GetItem write SetItem default   end    TGLItem  classTPersistent   private     FPosition TGLPosition     FDimensions TGLDimensions     FOwner TGLItems     FItemClass TGLItemClass     procedure PositionChangedSender TObject     procedure DimensionsChangedSender TObject     procedure SetPositionconst Value TGLPosition     procedure SetDimensionsconst Value TGLDimensions   public     constructor CreateOwner TGLItems     destructor Destroy override     procedure Draw     property Owner TGLItems read FOwner     property ItemClass TGLItemClass read FItemClass   published     property Position TGLPosition read FPosition write SetPosition     property Dimensions TGLDimensions read FDimensions write SetDimensions   end codepre  pimplementation...p  precode TGLItem   constructor TGLItem.Create begin   FPosition TGLPosition.Create   FPosition.OnChange PositionChanged   FDimensions TGLDimensions.Create   FDimensions.OnChange DimensionsChanged end  destructor TGLItem.Destroy begin   FPosition.Free   FDimensions.Free   inherited end  procedure TGLItem.DimensionsChangedSender TObject begin  end  procedure TGLItem.Draw begin   Draw to gl scene  end  procedure TGLItem.PositionChangedSender TObject begin  end  procedure TGLItem.SetDimensionsconst Value TGLDimensions begin   FDimensions.AssignValue end  procedure TGLItem.SetPositionconst Value TGLPosition begin   FPosition.AssignValue end   TGLItems   procedure TGLItems.AddAItem TGLItem begin   FItems.AddAItem   Expects objects to be created and maintained elsewhere   This list object will not createdestroy any items end  function TGLItems.Count Integer begin   Result FItems.Count end  constructor TGLItems.Create begin   FItems TList.Create end  destructor TGLItems.Destroy begin   FItems.Free   inherited end  function TGLItems.GetItemIndex Integer TGLItem begin   Result TGLItemFItems[Index] end  procedure TGLItems.SetItemIndex Integer const Value TGLItem begin   TGLItemFItems[Index].AssignValue end codepre  pThe OpenGL part of it isnt necessarily relevant in this scenario, I just wanted to explain a little detail of what this is intended for to have an idea of how I expect this to work.p  pI also have the idea of passing the codeTGLItemscode list object to each individual item in its constructor, and having each item register its self in the item list. In this case, the item list wouldnt have any add procedure, and I probably wouldnt even need a separate list object. Im just sure there should be some big trick to this that Im missing, and Im open to any large scale changes to the structure to more efficiently accommodate for this.p

Negative 849 pBefore this function executes, I use a SharePoint web service query to get a specific ID. This ID is used in links that are dynamically created. What I need to do is pass that ID to run a seperate query. So, what should happen is that when the user hovers over an element, my code grabs the ID and then queries for a story.

Negative 849 pIve got quite a number of classes, which have got the standard set and get methods.

Negative 849 pIve written a program that generates a sinewave at a userspecified frequency, and plays it on a 96kHz audio channel.  To save a few CPU cycles I employ the old trick of prerendering a short section of audio into a buffer, and then playing back the buffer in a loop, so that I can avoid calling the sin function 96000 times per second for the duration of the program and just do simple memorycopying instead.p  pMy problem is efficiently determining what the minimum usable size of this prerendered buffer would be.  For some frequencies it is easy  for example, an 8kHz sine wave can be perfectly represented by generating a 12sample buffer and playing it in a looping, because 800012  96000.  For other frequencies, however, a single cycle of the sine wave requires a nonintegral number of samples to represent, and therefore looping a single cycles worth of samples would cause unacceptable glitching.  p  pFor some of those frequencies, however, its possible to get around that problem by prerendering more than one cycle of the sine wave and looping that  if I can figure out how many cycles are required so that the number of cycles present in the buffer will be integral, while also guaranteeing that the number of samples in the buffer are integral.  For example, a sinewave frequency of 12.8kHz translates to a singlecycle buffersize of 7.5 samples, which wont loop cleanly, but if I render two consecutive cycles of the sine wave into a 15sample buffer, then I can cleanly loop the result.p  pMy current approach to solving this issue is brute force  I try all possible cyclecounts and see if any of them result in a buffer size with an integral number of samples in it.  I think that approach is unsatisfactory for the following reasonsp  p1 Its very inefficient.  For example, the program shown below which prints buffersize results for 480,000 possible frequency values between 0Hz and 48kHz takes 35 minutes to complete on my 2.7GHz machine.  I think there must be a much faster way to do this.p  p2 I suspect that the results are not 100 accurate, due to floatingpoint errors.p  p3 The algorithm gives up if it cant find an acceptable buffer size less than 10 seconds long.  I could make the limit higher, but of course that would make the algorithm even slower.p  pSo, is there any way to calculate the minimumusablebuffersize analytically, preferably in O1 time  It seems like it should be easy, but I havent been able to figure out what kind of math I should use.p  pThanks in advance for any advicep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltmath.hgt  static const long long SAMPLESPERSECOND               96000 static const long long MAXALLOWEDBUFFERSIZESAMPLES  SAMPLESPERSECOND  10   Returns the length of the prerender buffer needed to properly  loop a sine wave at the given frequence, or 1 on failure. static int GetNumCyclesNeededForPreRenderedBufferfloat freqHz     double oneCycleLengthSamples  SAMPLESPERSECONDfreqHz     for int count1 countoneCycleLengthSamples lt MAXALLOWEDBUFFERSIZESAMPLES count           double remainder  fmodoneCycleLengthSamplescount, 1.0       if remainder gt 0.5 remainder  1.0remainder       if remainder lt 0.0 return count        return 1   int mainint, char      for int i0 ilt4800010 i           double freqHz  doublei10.0f       int numCyclesNeeded  GetNumCyclesNeededForPreRenderedBufferfreqHz       if numCyclesNeeded gt 0                 double oneCycleLengthSamples  SAMPLESPERSECONDfreqHz          printfFor .1fHz, use a prerenderbuffer size of f samples i cycles, f samplescyclen, freqHz, numCyclesNeededoneCycleLengthSamples, numCyclesNeeded, oneCycleLengthSamples              else printfFor .1fHz, there was no suitable prerenderbuffer size under the allowed limitn, freqHz        return 0  codepre

Negative 849 pI am just curious to create an app which records video of iphone screen or capture images of iphone screen.  I know that Apple doesnt allow such kinds of apps on the app store and I have no intention of doing that.

If the game itself has some option to record video which generally is not available than that would be great.

I minimize my app and enter a game, then the screen shot will be of that game. Regardless which app is running it just needs to capture a screenshot of the iDevices screen.p

Negative 849 pI have a small software for MacOS with a simple dmg installer Open, drag and drop to Application folder, you know. My problem is, that the software writes a small ini file inside the .app package and if I update the software, this file is lost, because the old package is removed before writing the new one.p  pMy question is, if any of you know an elegant solution for this. The user should be able to save the file in any place e. g. desktop and the ini file should be moved into the new package. I dont want to save this file outside the .app package, because this would leave private data on the computer if the user just removes the package.p  pThanks in advance p

Now I only have 3 free pegs in my vector, I use those 3 free pegs to move n  p  1 disks to freepeg[2] and then I move the last disk from the source to the destination. So now I have 2 free pegs and 1 source  3 free pegs. Next, I need to move n  p  1 disks from peg[2] to the destination using 3 free pegs including the source which is now free. Finally, move p disks from freepeg[3] to the destination using 4 free pegs. However, when I implement this in my code, I am getting a segmentation fault, can someone please help me with thisp

Negative 849 pIn my simple game engine I have a vector containing pointers to entities. Each entity is allocated with the new keyword.

Using codegameEntitys.clearcode is useless to my knowledge as it only removes the elements of the vector not actually calling delete on them as they are pointers rather than actual data.p  pEdit I have bee watching the comments. The Entity class is not polymorphic and does not have any subclasses.

Negative 849 pIn a lot of situations I not only need the sine, but also the cosine of the same parameter.p  pFor C, there is the codesincoscode function in the common unix codemcode math library. And actually, at least on i386, this should be a single assembly instruction, codefsincoscode.p  blockquote   psincos, sincosf, sincosl  calculate sin and cos simultaneouslyp blockquote  pI guess these benefits exist because there is an obvious overlap in computing sine and cosine codesinx2  cosx2  1code. But AFAIK it does not pay off to try to shortcut this as codecos  Math.sqrt1  sinsincode, as the codesqrtcode function comes at a similar cost.p  pIs there any way to reap the same benefits in Java I guess Im going to pay a price for a codedouble[]code then which maybe makes all the efforts moot because of the added garbage collection.p  pOr is the Hotspot compiler smart enough to recognize that I need both, and will compile this to a codesincoscode command Can I test whether it recognizes it, and can I help it recognizing this, e.g. by making sure the codeMath.sincode and codeMath.coscode commands are directly successive in my code This would actually make the most sense from a Java language point of view having the comiler optimize this to use the codefsincoscode assembly call.p  pCollected from some assembler documentationp  precodeVariations    8087         287        387      486     Pentium fsin                              122771  257354   16126  NP fsincos                           194809  292365   17137  NP  Additional cycles required if operand gt pi4 3.1414  .785 sqrt        180186      180186    122129   8387    70      NP codepre  pcodefsincoscode should need an extra pop, but that should come at 1 clock cycle. Assuming that the CPU also does not optimize this, codesincoscode should be almost twice as fast as calling codesincode twice second time to compute cosine so i figure it will need to do an addition. codesqrtcode could be faster in some situations, but sine can be faster.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Ive done some experiments in C, but they are inconclusive. Interestingly enough, codesincoscode seems to be even slightly faster than codesincode without codecoscode, and the GCC compiler will use codefsincoscode when you compute both codesincode and codecoscode  so it does what Id like Hotspot to do or does Hotspot, too. I could not yet prevent the compiler from outsmarting me by using codefsincoscode except by not using codecoscode. It will then fall back to a C codesincode, not codefsincode.p

Negative 849 pRecently I learned that using smart ptr could make our work easier. I tried to add boostscopedptr into my code. However, Im quite not sure whether I should delete a pointer to class. Here is my codep  precode    class onTimeStepOp  public QWidget              public             some function here             onTimeStepOpdelete xr         private             xmlReader xr             others.       forint i  m i gt 1 i      boostscopedptrltonTimeStepOpgt otsonew onTimeStepOp                                              QStringnumbercurrentFrameNum  i,                                                QStringnumbercurrentFrameNum                                                        do something here.  codepre  pIt seems that the otso will call its destructor at the end of the scope. So I added the destructor into the class. The program crashed after running. However, without the destructor, it seems that the program is leaking memory with the help of Valgrind. Im quite confused about that. Does it mean that deletion is unnecessaryMay be deleting a freed memory for the second time Im not sure about that when using smart pointer and how does the code crash p

Negative 849 pI was wondering if there is a way i can write the .h file a function prototype, and in the implementation to change the signature, so it will be slightly different from the prototype.p  pThe reason that i want to do it is because there is some include of an enum type that i dont want to do in the .h file, but only in the .c file, and the enum is part of the functions signature, so i was wondering if i can write the enum as a INT enum and int are basically the same.. or something in the prototype, but then i get a compilation error.. Is there a nice way i can do it p  pThanks in advance..p

Negative 849 pSo this is a somewhat broad question, I know, but Im hoping someone who is wiser than I can provide a summary answer that can help wrap up all of the ins and outs of SSL for me.p  pRecently I watched a video of Moxie Marlinspike giving a presentation at BlackHat, and after the hour was up, I thought to myself, It doesnt really matter what I do. Theres always a way in for a determined hacker.  I recall his final example, in which he demonstrated how even using a redirect when the user typed in an HTTP address to go directly to HTTPS, there is still an opportunity in that transition for an attacker to insert himself via MITM.p  pSo if browsers always default to HTTP, and users very rarely enter an HTTPS address directly in the address bar, then an attacker who is listening for accesses to Bank Xs website will always have an opportunity during the HTTP  HTTPS redirect to gain control.  I think they have to be on the same network, but thats little consolation.  Seems like Marlinspikes point was that until we go straight HTTPS as a standard rather than an alternative, this will always be a problem.p  pAm I understanding this correctly  What is the point in redirecting to HTTPS if an attacker can use MITM during the transition to gain control  Does anyone have any clue as to preventative measures one might take to protect himself  Would redirecting via javascript that obfuscates the HTTPS links so they cant be stripped out in transit be of any help  Any thoughts would be appreciatedp

Negative 849 pI have 40 UIView tile objects on the screen. Then in the view controller I have routine to flip those tiles using codetransitionFromViewcode message. If I flip them at once in the loop, on the simulator it looks smooth, but on the iPhone its struggling to flip them. Thats because iPhone CPUGPU is slower and cant handle so many transitions at a time. So what I want is to make some sort of chain transitions, eventually transitioning 510 at any given time. Each flip takes 0.4s now. What is the easiest way to do thatp

Negative 849 pIm working on web chat where user log in and can send message to any other logged in user. This is realized using long polling on client side and async java servlet on server side. It works well, until I log in under the same name from two different devices. Once the servlet receives the message for user A, it searches for the first waiting request of A first because the second one may be waiting for another message, sends him the message and deletes it from internal queue. However, when they are two logged in A clients mobile and PC for example only the first one receives the message. I cant send it for all A requests, because the second waiting A request may be another from one device and sending the message twice is not good. Do you have any ideas how to solve this on the server side How to send message to all devices of user A, but not more times to more waiting request from one device of user A.p  pThanksp

Negative 849 pIm using a federated repository in WAS v8.0.0.5.  That federated repo contains a JDBC repo, 3 Active Directory LDAP repos, and a filebased repo.  The repos are set to a realm and domain, which is used by a Java EE 6 enterprise application.  Im implementing Java EE 6 Security, specifically Servlet Spec 3.0 authentication.p  pWithin the app, Im able to log in and authenticate users from all of the repos, however I cannot obtain the users role for all of the repos except the JDBC repo.  Specifically, I mean using Servelet Spec 3.0s request.isUserInRole.  The correct groups and users appear within WASs Admin Console VMM.  Im mapping groups to application roles via the .ear projects ibmapplicationbnd.xml.  Ive checked the spellingspaces of the mappings.  Everything is correct.  Ive checked the .war projects web.xml too for any typos.  Everything looks fine.  Since the JDBC repo works with no problems, Ive compared its .ear and .war roletogroup mappings to the LDAP mappings.p  pIve discovered that if I map specific users to groups in ibmapplicationbnd.xml for the LDAP repos, the users roles can then be confirmed.  This inidicates to me that theres something wrong with my mapping configuration between Active Directory Users and Groups.p  pAs far as config goes, Ill talk about 1 of the LDAP reposbr I have Group defined in LDAP entity types as being mapped to Object Classes groupgroupOfNamesgroupOfUniqueNames I think group is just needed, but Ive been trying anything to figure this out.br PersonAccount is mapped to the Object Class user.br Out of desperation, Ive also created a Supported LDAP attribute named memberOf and mapped it to the PersonAccount entity type.br As far as the Group attribute definiition, Ive set Name of group membership attribute to memberof and specified a scope of Direct.  I also tried memberOf, which didnt change anything.p  pUsing Apache Directory Studio to browse Active Directory, I can confirm that user and group are the two object classes Im seeking.p  pCan someone please shed some light on what I have wrong with the configp

Negative 849 pIm very new to assembly programming, I wrote a function in C which need to call another function in assembly. It seems like the register wants to give back four characters bytes instead of one, which is what I want. p  pIgnore the code after the jump, since I jump just to skip this part of the code until i make this work properly.p  pThis is actually supposed to be part of my own simplified version of codesprintfcode in C. I removed some of my code just to get things to work. Its supposed to return the first parameter with a codecode.

Negative 849 p        I want to use an application that checks for broken links. I got to know that, Xenu is one such software. I do not have access to internal aspxhttp files on a drive.

After login I need to crawl the site to determine which links are broken. p  p As an example, I kick off with mail.google.com. We end up typing the Username and password after which we are served different URLs. If I give the Xenu or similar programs the link such as mail.google.com it will not be able to fecth URLs inside the mail.google.com which will be of type  mailu0shva1inbox etc. There lies the problem.  p  p With minimal or least scripting language how can I provide Xenu or other similar app capability to Login by providing external URL mail.google.com in this example in order to do whatever xenu has to do. p  pThanks brBalaji S p

Negative 849 pI have written a math game in Java, and have distributed some copies to a few betatesters. The problem is that the version I have given them is saving the GameData via object serialization, which I found out is mainly for sending Objects, or in this case, ArrayLists of GameData, over a network. It is NOT persistance that is what a relational database is for. Knowing this, I would like to know if it would be better to create a database on the betatesters machine and rewrite the game, or continue with the Object serialization version of the game, and then retrieve the Objects when they are ready to send the datap  pMy guess would be to just move their data to a database that is created on their computer, and then give them the database version of the game. That way, the data can be persisted and be much easier to manipulate. What turns me away from that idea is the question of how am I going to write their database into mine in the futurep

I like this method because I can easily change up the names of the tools without having to change the way they are called. However, I would like to ultimately control the tool names for multiple programs all through one database, and that is why I am looking to essentially copy this Dictionary class over to a SQL server. I think this is done in the form of a single table, but I am BARELY experienced with SQL Server Management Studio, and that is why I am coming here for help.p  pstrongWhat I want to knowstrong How can I create a table in SQL that allows me to reference the tools by their corresponding integer similar to the way I am already doing it If it is as simple as copying all the data into a table and then referencing it with a slightly different function, then I apologize for the simple question, and a simple answer would still be welcomed p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongEDITstrong Apparently I didnt give myself enough credit. I already have a table created within a database through SQL Server Management Studio. This table just has two columns, codenumbercode and codenamecode. If this is wrong, then I was asking what I need to do to change or fix it, and then if this is correct, I just want to know what I need to do within Visual Studio in order to reference these tools just like I can with the dictionary. Is it really as simple as importing the database and then referencing it with codedb.Tools.[number]code or something like thatp
Negative 849 pIm looking for any advice on the best way to migrate a SharePoint 2007 installation and a database.

So I did the code.postcode method to post the form after modify the serialize data. It also works good. p  pBut the URL doesnt goes to the action page. Because it did in ajax. But I want to go the action page along with the modified data like submit. Is it possible in jQuery with modified data submit.p  p1 My point to achieve  the user must not see the modified value before form submit but needs to post the modified data to backend. p  pNote I cant change the action page which was already developed.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 849 pI have a JEditoPane inside a JScrollPane.  I have some text content that contain some predefined tokens. Im storing the location of these tokens in the database. When I set the text content into the JEditorPane, I embed the tokens with HTML.  I also add HTML break lines to format the content.p  pNow problem comes when I want to scroll to one of the highlighted tokens.  It seems that  the start position of the tokens, which I stored in database,  do not match when using the setCaretPositionint.  I know its probably because my content in JEditorPane Document is mixed with HTML.p  pSo is there a way to search for a String in the JEditorPane content, then somehow get the caret position where the string was foundp

This is what I have so far. p  precodepublic int findLastE item     int index  array.length  1      while index gt 0 ampamp comp.compareitem, array[index] lt 0          index           return index  codepre  pI believe that this will find the index if there is a match within the array, and the next largest value if a match is not found, unless the array is not full.

Negative 849 pI am working on an application for Windows Phone 8 and Id like to give the possibility to the users to login with their Facebook account, so they wont have to create an account on my application.p  pI saw the Facebook SDK for .NET and decided to use it because it seems to be really efficient and popular.p  pAs a beginner, I followed the tutorial in the doc of the SDK  a hrefhttpfacebooksdk.netdocsphonetutorial relnofollowhttpfacebooksdk.netdocsphonetutorialap  pI did the exact same thing that in the tutorial, everything is okay since I login.

After that, Im redirected to the page that asks for permissions on my Facebook account, I click on OK. Everything is good so far.p  pAnd then comes my problem. I should be redirected to what they call the LandingPage in the tutorial, but instead of that Im redirected to the facebook loginsuccess a hrefhttpswww.facebook.comconnectloginsuccess.html relnofollowhttpswww.facebook.comconnectloginsuccess.htmla which displays Success and also a security warning, and then nothing happens anymore...p  pI thought something in my code was not right so I spend a couple of hours working on it, didnt find anything.

I also tried other things that I found on the Nokia Developer Wiki, same thing.p  pSo I think something is wrong with my Facebook Application, but I cant find what it is...

Therefore I can not specify some custom wrapper for my headerfooter data.p  pAlternatively I can define that wrapper inside TypoScript, but this will spread header template code across typoscript code.

Negative 849 pI have a request form a client and am looking for advice on the best procedure. I believe that HTML 5 can help however Im not too experience in the more advanced features of HTML 5 to come to a conclusion.p  pBasically my client is looking to have a universe which in effect really is just a large graph. Plotted within the universe are elements that are added by users. This amount will increase over time. Hence the graph will increase in dimensions. The idea is to see the universe as a whole with small dots representing elements. Then a user can zoom in andor pan the universe to discover different elements. Clicking an element bring up a dialog and more information can be gained. Zooming can happen in real time or is it acceptable to click a region and it gets bigger.p  pMy assumption is that the best way to go about this is to use HTML 5 and Javascript.

Negative 849 pI apologize for this very newbie question, but Ive never worked with web services before.p  pIm attempting to send data to a site that has an API. Im using an application not coding something new myself that has a feature to connect using web services. This app connects to the WSDL site to obtain a list of available services. I enter in the parameters for a specific function and the app effectively builds the URI.p  pI then attempt to send the URI but receive internal server error 500. I recognize there can be many things wrong with what Im doing, so Im seeking some guidance on where to start looking.p  pThe Webservice examples given are all SOAP in XML. As all my app is doing is building the URI, does this mean it will not work or is the app effectively sending it in SOAP behind the scenes Unfortunately this is not a public app so there is no way for anyone to test. p  pWould a plugin such as Chromes Advanced Rest Client App allow me to connect for testing purposes I receive the same internal server error 500 there. The site Im connecting to does require authentication in all API calls, but Im not sure how to enter that in the Advanced Rest Client App. In my app, there are fields for authentication but that doesnt seem to make a difference.p  pI apologize again for my lack of knowledge...everyone is a newbie at some point.p

Negative 849 pI ask this because I am having a problem with my C project.  To solve it I know a redesign of my code will suffice, but if Windows Service doesnt start how I think it does then I would need to do more thinking.p  pTherefore I need this question answered...p  pWhen does exactly a Windows Service start, or is this something the developer can choose and if so where exactly in the code can I do that p  pMore infop  ul lipI know there is Delayed Start... but its not that reliable, with this my Service starts correctly at times and at others it does not. Because it relies on VirtualBox or the HD to set up.pli lipI tried using a separate thread at Service Startup to give the system time to settle, this solves the problem initially but after further testing realized that if the user wanted to stop my service it becomes into a problem because the thread would still be going active. And creates a bug.pli ul

Negative 849 pI am a newbie with objective c style development. I have an android app which I am trying to convert into an iPhone app. p  pIn the android app I have a codeLocationManagercode, codeLocationListenercode created, which codeonLocationChangedcode behaves the usual way to give me the updated location, as and when it changes. p  precodeLocationManager locationManager  LocationManager this             .getSystemServiceContext.LOCATIONSERVICE      Define a listener that responds to location updates     LocationListener locationListener  new LocationListener          Override         public void onLocationChangedLocation location                 some logic here                locationManager.requestLocationUpdates             LocationManager.NETWORKPROVIDER, minTimeInterval, 0,             locationListener codepre  pI have used the codeCLLocationManagercode to generate location information in the ios app p  precode self.locationManager  [[CLLocationManager alloc] init] if  [CLLocationManager locationServicesEnabled]       self.locationManager.delegate  self     self.locationManager.distanceFilter  100     [self.locationManager setDesiredAccuracykCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters]     [self.locationManager startUpdatingLocation]  codepre  phow do I ensure that as and when the location changes this would be called and I would get the new location information. Of course at this point in time I am using the ios simulator and not the iphone hardware, but technically I would want this to work on the iphone too. p  pany suggestions  p

Negative 849 pI built a neural network to predict a certain kind of data  biological sequences . It has 32 features where 12 have certain units and 20 are simply integers  but positive. My positive set has 648 samples and negatives 9000 samples.p  pTo train my network I took 500 samples of both and rest were used for testing.

Negative 849 pI am trying to trigger a codescrollcode event or a codekeypresscode event on a window that I have loaded under codejsdomcode. I have loaded the window using codejsdom.jsdomcode function, and it has the external resources loaded i.e.. the scripts on the page itself. Basically I am trying to trigger these events so that the javascript on the page can listen to those events and loads the next page of data, as the page has the autoload feature when the scrolled to bottom. But I am having trouble with just triggering the codescrollcode event, let alone triggering codescrollcode to the bottom of the page. It is just getting stuck, nothing is happening.p  pI also tried to trigger codekeypresscode event with the key of codeendcode but for that I am not even able to set a handler for keypress. again getting stuck. p  pI am using codejsdom.jqueryifycode on the window to embed codejquerycode code in it. I thought with that I could use jquery function like .scroll to set a test handler, but again it is getting stuck, without giving any error messages.

Negative 849 pWe are using ActiveMQ 5.8.0 in combination with Spring JMS 3.2.3.RELEASE. The application listens to a queue using the Spring codeDefaultMessageListenerContainercode, and objects are stored in an codeActiveMQTextMessagecode using the Spring codeMappingJackson2MessageConvertercode.p  pWe also use the ActiveMQ broker redelivery plugin, which is configured in codeactivemq.xmlcode. Messages are persisted in an Oracle database, also configured in codeactivemq.xmlcode.p  pNow we have the following problem in about 60 of the messages that are redelivered, the codejavaClasscode property that is set on the message by the codeMappingJackson2MessageConvertercode is missing. This causes the following stack tracep  precodeorg.springframework.jms.support.converter.MessageConversionException Could not find type id property [javaClass]             at org.springframework.jms.support.converter.MappingJackson2MessageConverter.getJavaTypeForMessageMappingJackson2MessageConverter.java360             at org.springframework.jms.support.converter.MappingJackson2MessageConverter.fromMessageMappingJackson2MessageConverter.java176 codepre  pWhen examining the persisted messages in our database we see that the codejavaClasscode property is indeed missing. But the coderedeliveryDelaycode and codeAMQSCHEDULEDDELAYcode properties that are set by the codeRedeliveryPlugincode are present.p  pCould this be caused by a bug in ActiveMQ I see that codeRedeliveryPlugin.scheduleRedeliverycode sets the codemarshalledPropertiescode to null, which should be correct behaviour to ensure that all properties are serialised in codeMessage.beforeMarshallcode.

Negative 849 pI have a question about Tycho packaging types and project structure. I currently have a project that has both source and test source directories following typical Maven convention, which is built using package type eclipseplugin. This results in tests not being run in the maven build. The most common solution I can find is to separate the test source to a projectbundle of its own and build that via eclipsetestplugin. My question What are the drawbacks of keeping the Maven convention and just building the whole project as eclipsetestplugin insteadp  pAccording to a hrefhttpwiki.eclipse.orgTychoPackagingTypes relnofollowhttpwiki.eclipse.orgTychoPackagingTypesa Tycho introduces new eclipsetestplugin packaging type to represent such projects. Build behavior is like regular Eclipse plugins, but these are treated specially at testtime.p  pThis makes me believe that there are actually no drawbacks apart from the resulting bundle possibly depending on bundles that are only required for the test source. However, this is also the case for building via eclipseplugin without splitting. Is it safe to say that changing packaging type to eclipsetestplugin in this case only results in tests being run in the maven build with no other sideeffectsp

Negative 849 pIf you read the a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepo1.maven.orgmaven2net.java.openjfx.backportopenjfx78backport1.8.0eab96.1javafxbeanspropertyReadOnlyDoubleWrapper.javaReadOnlyDoubleWrapper relnofollowsourcea for codeReadOnyObjectWrappercode, you will see that the codegetReadOnlyPropertycode method uses a simple singleton instance scheme, i.e.p  precodeReadOnlyPropertyImp readOnlyProperty  public ReadOnlyDoubleProperty getReadOnlyProperty     ifreadOnlyProperty  null         readOnlyProperty  new ReadOnlyPropertyImp          return readOnlyProperty  codepre  pwhere codeReadOnlyPropertyImpcode is a nested class extending codeReadOnlyDoublePropertycode. It seems to me, though, that if I were to do p  precodeReadOnlyDoubleWrapper wrapper new ReadOnlyDoubleWrapper ReadOnlyDoubleProperty property  wrapper.getReadOnlyProperty codepre  pnow neither codewrappercode nor codepropertycode will ever be garbagecollected since each contains a strong reference to the other. Is this accurate    p
Negative 849 pI have been working on a small application and this section of it has stumped me. I have a codelistFieldcode as seen above the buttons in the screenshot, some buttons, and some static codeeditFieldscode on this page, and I am having trouble with scrolling. p  pI want the codelistFieldcode to be limited to displaying 5 rows it is displaying 2 in the screenshot, and if there are more than 5 items in the listField, to be able to scroll through them not scroll the whole page, just the listview. p  pI also have another issue with the editFields, if they become too large due to large amounts of text they will disappear off the screen, as my Screen will not run without a call to codesuperManager.NOVERTICALSCROLLcode which is apparently needed for the codelistFieldcode to work.p  pIs the only solution to this problem to implement a complete custom class of codelistFieldcode Or is there a simpler alternativep  pScreenshot on imgur because I dont have enough rep to post images a hrefhttpimgur.comRcfspQP relnofollowhttpimgur.comRcfspQPap  pThanks, Quinnp  pstrongEDITstrongp  precodepublic class TestScreen extends MainScreen public TestScreen     Without this call to super which turns off vertical scrolling the program throws an IllegalStateException and wont open the screen     superManager.NOVERTICALSCROLL      Create some managers to organize the different Fields     VerticalFieldManager verticalAllManager  new VerticalFieldManager     VerticalFieldManager verticalInfoManager  new VerticalFieldManager     Going to use this to limit the number of rows the list will display     VerticalFieldManager verticalListManager  new VerticalFieldManager              protected void sublayoutint width, int height              Just test numbers             super.sublayoutwidth, 100                   HorizontalFieldManager horizontalButtonManager  new HorizontalFieldManager      Add a title bar     addnew LabelFieldChoose the call you want to view, LabelField.FIELDHCENTER     addnew SeparatorField      Creates the SimpleList ListField     Manager mainManager  getMainManager     final SimpleList listField  new SimpleListmainManager      Add items to the listField     listField.addTime 1230  Date 3102014     listField.addTime 0313  Date 1252013      Creates a button to use for selecting the desired call     final ButtonField selectCall  new ButtonFieldSelect Call, ButtonField.CONSUMECLICK      Creates fields for all the required information blank to start     final BasicEditField timeField, dateField, numberField, nameField     timeField  new BasicEditFieldCall Time ,      dateField  new BasicEditFieldCall Date ,      numberField  new BasicEditFieldCall Number ,      nameField  new BasicEditFieldCaller Name ,       Creates a button that can be used to save changes     final ButtonField saveChanges  new ButtonFieldSave Changes, ButtonField.CONSUMECLICK     final ButtonField deleteRow  new ButtonFieldDelete Call, ButtonField.CONSUMECLICK      Adds all the info fields into a vertical manager to organize them     verticalInfoManager.addtimeField     verticalInfoManager.adddateField     verticalInfoManager.addnumberField     verticalInfoManager.addnameField      Adds the 3 buttons to a horizontal manager to lay them out in a row     horizontalButtonManager.addselectCall     horizontalButtonManager.addsaveChanges     horizontalButtonManager.adddeleteRow      Add the horizontal button manager to the vertical page manager     verticalAllManager.addhorizontalButtonManager      Add the vertical info manager to the vertical page manager     verticalAllManager.addverticalInfoManager      Add all the managers, under the page manager, to the page     addverticalAllManager   codepre  pp  pHere is the sample page I have added, along with another screenshot of how it looks when it is run img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2MltF.png althttpimgur.comxtPNr7pp  pThe biggest problem right now is that the call to super with NOVERTICALSCROLL turns off scrolling for the entire page.

Ive looked through other postings regarding reflection, but cant seem to make any sense of them in terms of what Im doing.  p  pThe idea is to pass a method a class, then loop through that objects properties and assign its value to a return value.  The return value will later be used to create an SQL statement on the fly.  Ive created the loop using PropertyInfo, and Im able to tell the type of property based on a switch statement.  The problem is once Im in the specific case for the property, Im having a difficult time trying to figure out how to assign that particular properties value to the list to be returned later.  Here is my code, thanks in advance for any help.p  precode    public Listltstringgt BuildParametersFromObjectclsBook oBook, clsStudent oStud              Listltstringgt lstRetVal  new Listltstringgt         string sTemp           string sPropType           int ii         if oBook  null                      PropertyInfo[] ObjProperties  typeofclsStudent.GetProperties             foreach PropertyInfo StudProp in ObjProperties                              ii  0                 sPropType  Convert.ToStringStudProp.PropertyType                 switch sPropType                                      case System.String                         lstRetVal.AddStudProp.GetValueclsStudent, null                         break                     case System.Int32                          break                     case System.Decimal                          break                     case System.Boolean                          break                     case System.DateTime                          break                                                 return lstRetVal      codepre

Negative 849 pstrongUpdated  Title changed bc codeStyleSheetThemecode and codeThemecode have nothing to do with it  see answer for details.strongp  pIm working on a page that has descended, through several years and a few intermediary stages, from another page that successfully uses the AJAX codepageLoadcode function to perform some reinitialization on full and partial postbacks.p  pThe codepageLoadcode on this new page was not firing.

This will be passed to the selenium jar as      the system property webdriver.chrome.driver. If null, selenium will      attempt to find chromedriver using PATH.     chromeDriver null,      If true, only chromedriver will be started, not a standalone selenium.      Tests for browsers other than chrome will not run.     chromeOnly false,      Additional command line options to pass to selenium. For example,      if you need to change the browser timeout, use      seleniumArgs [browserTimeout60],     seleniumArgs [     ],       If sauceUser and sauceKey are specified, seleniumServerJar will be ignored.

Negative 849 pI am using Java and webdriver to automate a test. This test is for 2 dropdowns, and has drilldown functionality. So, the first dropdown contains a list of options, and the second one will be populated differently based on what the user selects in the first. I am trying to test selecting all the different options in the first dropdown, and verifying that the correct options are available in the second dropdown. For example, the first dropdown could have choices A and B. If I select A, the second dropdown will have choices 1, 2, and 3. If I select B, the second dropdown will have choices 8, 9, and 10. p  pI was having an issue when changing the values in the first dropdown. When I selected A, webdriver would try to check to see if 1, 2, and 3 were available in the 2nd dropdown before it was loaded. This was causing my tests to fail. p  pTo resolve this issue, I added a fluent wait for the second dropdown. So, if I chose either A or B in the first dropdown, it would wait until the 2nd dropdown loaded before checking the available options. This solution worked great for testing in chrome and firefox. However, it does not help when using IE10. When I run the test in IE10, it is still trying to check the values of the second dropdown before they are loaded, which causes my test to fail. p  pHas anyone come across issues with fluent wait when using IE. The only way I have been able to get it to work in IE, is to add a sleep line. if I use something like sleep2000, it seemed to work. However, that could still cause my tests to fail if the web page were running slow and took longer to load. p  pHere is the code I am using for fluent wait. I am selecting a value from the first dropdown. Then I use smartSleep to wait for the 2nd dropdown, and then check the values in that dropdown. Please let me know if more information is needed to help understand the issue I am having. p  precodepublic void smartSleepString selector         log.infoINFO waiting for the selector to appear         fluentWaitPresentselector         log.infoINFO Smart Sleep waited for  selector      codepre

Negative 849 pIm adapting an old JS no framework  Rails app as an Ember learning exercise. The idea of the application is that Im producing a pdf from some data input. In the initial version, there was no user persistence  you could modify the data provided to you in the tables, and then download the PDF of it.p  pAs part of this, I decided to run with a decidedly nonstandard ember framework  Im essentially using Ember Data to load the initial value of the tables. Ember has been a really natural fit for the models I have on the Rails side, and its made a lot of the more complicated calculations a lot easier. The issue I have is that my initial idea was that when I came to download the PDF, Id respond to the save action on Ember Data with binary data with an applicationpdf header, which I could then use something like FileSaver.js to serve up to the client. Then, I found that EmberData needs JSON return value.p  pSo I base64 encoded my PDF response and fired it back..but it didnt fit the model schema. I thought Id then do a manual AJAX save p  precodeCalculateYourTV.RostersShowController  Ember.ObjectController.extend   actions     download function       var roster  this.getmodel       var team  roster.getteam       return this.ajaxURL GOES HERE, record.toJSON, PUT.thenfunctiondata          console.logcalled         console.logdata            ,     codepre  pAnd this is where Im currently stuck. Is there any way to access the URL that EmberData is posting to I could hardcode a route in the Rails side of things, but I dont like hardcoding routes in here, and Id like to keep it as reusable as possible Im planning to eventually allow data persistance.p

Negative 849 pIm making my first freemovement not tiles restricted 2d game and was wondering how to work with the collision detection. I have 3 possible methods on my mind but not sure what would be the most efficient onep  ol lipEach object on map has a texture smaller then the image itself for example, a tree would have a smaller texture representing the base of it only that cant collide. For this i would use a 2nd invisible texture to mark the area.pli lipEach object has a rectangle or circular area for the collision. Possible each texture would need a aux file with how big the collision should be tree example again.pli lipI create a tiled map where the tiles are small enough as to let the player almost touch the object.pli ol  pI would really appreciate if someone could help me decide what method I should be using x.x. thanks in advance.p  pIf you play old games, Im trying to follow the Secret of Mana game movement style, if that helpsp

Negative 849 pFor the past few weeks, I have been working on an algorithm that finds hidden surfaces of complex meshes and removes them. These hidden surfaces are completely occluded, and will never be seen. Due to the nature of the meshes Im working with, there are a ton of these hidden triangles. In some cases, there are more hidden surfaces than visible surfaces. As removing them manually is prohibitive for larger meshes, I am looking to automate this with software. p  pMy current algorithm consists ofp  ol liGenerating several points on the surface of a triangle.li liFor each point, generate a hemisphere sampler aligned to the normal of the triangle.li liCast rays up into the hemispheres.li liIf there are less than a certain number of rays unoccluded, I flag the triangle for deletion.li ol  pHowever, this algorithm is causing a lot of grief. Its very inconsistent. While some of the occluded faces are not found as occluded by the algorithm, Im more worried about very visible faces that get removed due to issues with the current implementation. Therefore, Im wondering about two things, mainlyp  ol liIs there a better way to find and remove these hidden surfaces than raytracingli liShould I investigate nonrandom ray generation Im currently generating random directions in a cosineweighted hemisphere, which could be causing issues. The only reason I havent investigated this is because I have yet to find an algorithm to generate evenlyspaced rays in a hemisphere. li ol  pNote This is intended to be an object space algorithm.

The reason for this is that no software may be installed in the target environment. So because we are not directly sending SQL to our target database, in our case prepared statements are of no help. p  pDo you know of a way to generate the result SQL after performing the database migration with a tool inmemory which ensures that everything is escaped correctly in the generated SQL filesp
Negative 849 pI have a WCF service written in vs2010 that is referenced and consumed by a client that needed to be written in vs2008 because of a vendor SDK specification issue the client is for a barcode scanner and their SDK only works with vs2008. p  pThe 2010 WCF function returns a boolean.p  pThe client, because it is written in 2008, calls the method in the following way codemethodName[complexserializablecontracttype],             [byref returnarea as boolean],              [byref returnareaspecified as boolean]codep  pWhen my client application calls this method I am receiving an codeIndexOutOfRangeExceptioncode.p  pWhen the return type boolean is changed to integer the same exception is thrown.p  pWhen the return type is removed the method works fine except that my client doesnt get a confirmation.p  pThe service has other functions where the return type is a complex type array of contracted types and works fine.p  pI have heard of wcf not being able to handle certain types that are not serializable, but this is the first time ive run into the issue where primitive types are causing the issue, particularly since I am calling the method with the specified argument to handle the .net 1.1 deal with primitives not allowed to be null or whatever that issue was.p  pAny help is appreciated, Thanks.p

Negative 849 pIm trying to reverseengineer a serial interface for a blood glucose meter.. essentially trying to upload data from a java program instead of from the meter itself allows me to upload data from different sources.  There is some form of checksum on the data send and so far I have been unable to create code that recreates the checksum digit or digits used.p  pI have a full communications trace of an upload from the meter to destination programp  pThe two transmissions Ive been using to check my work are as follows BRBThe DateB 06 02 30 36 31 34 31 30 30 31 36 42 04 06BR ... which translates to [ACK][STX]061410016B[EOT][ACK]  BRBRThe pertinent part of this transmission is the string 141001.. which stands for year142014, month10 October, day01 the 1st.  BRBRIm not positive what the 06 at the begging of the string is.  The B at the end I presume is a checksum, the 6 just before it might be part of the checksum.. but seems to stay the same despite the date transmitted.p  pBRBThe TimeB     06 02 30 36 30 38 33 31 30 39 36 44 04 06BRbr ... which translates to [ACK][STX]060831096D[EOT][ACK]  BRBRThe pertinent part of this transmission is the 083109 which stands for 83109 AM....  BRBRonce again the string starts with 06 and ends with 6.. but this one ends with a D which is presumably the checksum.p  pHR Ive tried a number of algorithms to the best of my ability with the string in various forms  without the ACK, without the ACK and STX, without the ACK, STX, and 06, witout the trailing 6 and all permutations of that. BRBRp  pI think that the leading character may refer to the number of pertinent digits.. in the datetime each have 6 pertinent digits. BR Other transmissions seem to make that hold true BR06 02 30 34 30 39 31 30 36 36 04 06   [ACK][STX]04091066[EOT][ACK] BR         Starts with 04.. has 4 digits then 2 trailing digitsp  p06 02 30 38 31 34 38 39 34 34 39 35 36 36 04 06   [ACK][STX]081489449566[EOT][ACK] Starts with 08, has 8 digits with 2 trailing digits BRBR but others later dont necessarily fall in line.

I emthinkem this rules out CRC as well as some other checksum standards...p  pBRBR changing this character emdoes notem seem to have an effect on the checksum either, as changing it to a 7 is not rejected by the other side. [ACK][STX]0B6B0831096D[EOT][ACK]p  pBRBR changing this character emdoesem cause the other side to reject the record.. so its either used in the checksum or is part of the checksum.. but of the 300400 records I saw go across it was a 6 in all of them.

Negative 849 pI have built OpenSSL for Android. This has generated a so with an extension in the format .so.1.0.0, and a symlink with the extension.so. This of course is a problem for Android, as it expects all shared libraries to have an extension in the format .so.p  pAdditionally, I have some other prebuilt libraries that require on a file with the name libssl.so.p  pTherefore I need a library to end with .so, and all libraries that depend on it to link to a file with the extension .so. The OpenSSL instructions here a hrefhttpwiki.openssl.orgindex.phpAndroid relnofollowhttpwiki.openssl.orgindex.phpAndroida suggest renaming the file to libssl.so. Which I have done.p  pHowever, the library still has the soname libssl.so.1.0.0 When I try and build my own libraries which also need openSSL using the ajbtools a hrefhttpssubversion.assembla.comsvnajbtoolstrunkandroidandroidcrossandroidcross relnofollowhttpssubversion.assembla.comsvnajbtoolstrunkandroidandroidcrossandroidcrossa, using codelopensslcode it generates shared objects which apparently require the library file in the format libssl.so.1.0.0, a file that didnt exist anymore at build time. At runtime, the Android app complains it cant find this file.p  pI have tried putting codellibssl.socode in the makefile of my library, to no avail. codereadelf dcode still reports my libraries need libssl.so.1.0.0.p  pIs there any way to force a library to link to a specific file name. Or do I have to build OpenSSL in such a way that it generates a library that has its soname set to .sop

Negative 849 pI have excel with macros run in Mac OS. One of the macros uses emWorkbooks.Openem to open a file in network folder a SharePoint site. It works fine if there is connection into the network. Also it works fine if the user of the Mac profile runs the macro for the strongfirst timestrong with the strongnetwork connection on or offstrong. If there is no connection Mac returns error like it should when run first time. However the problem is that after the user has succesfully used the file macro with the connection on once then emWorkbooks.Openem does not return any error when running the macro second time and the network connection is down.  I added exit sub command right after the Open method and could see that there is same network file open on excel with status of Offline file. That file was the same as the one previously opened when using the macro with network open for the first time. However the file was not fetched from the network drive as this time there is no connection to network. Tried to find the file from Mac file system, without success.p  pWhat creates the offline copy and where is it stored How to delete the offline file via vba code or how to prevent excel or Mac from creating it ever againp  pBr,p  pMikkoTp

The structure will be something like p  precodeltdivgt  ltdiv class  columnbordergtltdivgt  ltdivgtltspangtSome text for column 2ltspangtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pIn that case, the border doesnt show up. I wouldnt expect this to happen as I have applied the style to the div not the span. How can I avoid this scenario What could be causing thisp

Negative 849 pIve been trying to look for a solution, or if anyone else facing the same problem on the Internet for past few hours, no luck. I decided to ask here to see if anyone knows what went wrong with my code.p  pThe project I work on is a hrefhttpsandroidmmu.herokuapp.com relnofollowmy schools Android Study Group sitea and the code is open sourced on a hrefhttpswww.github.comgsammuAndroidClubSite relnofollowGitHuba, if you wish to dig it.p  pThe site uses Google signin button to allow club members to signin with just 1 click. This is what I intended it to dop  ol liUser clicks on Google Signin button.li liPermission granted, redirect to the site.li lipGoogle JS API calls the callback function, which AJAX POST the access token etc to the server side to authenticate. The code is as belowp  precodewindow.googleSigninCallback  authResultgt   console.log googleSigninCallback authResult    if userloggedin and authResult[status][signedin]      console.log Before AJAX fires...

Apparently after the user clicks signin, the callback function is being called, but it dies just right before the AJAX request is fired. Opening up the Chrome console, it looks something like thisp  precode    Object googleSigninCallback Object     Before AJAX fires...     cbgapi.loaded039 Uncaught SecurityError Blocked a frame with origin httplocalhost5000 from accessing a frame with origin httpsaccounts.google.com.  The frame requesting access has a protocol of http, the frame being accessed has a protocol of https. Protocols must match. codepre  pIf the AJAX is fired, as in the code suggests, it should display codeAfter AJAX fires...code but it didnt, there is no sign of the AJAX being fired in the network tab as well.p  pAnd the error message is like as if the AJAX is a frame trying to access google server when it should actually POST to my server. p  pemSifusem, any ideasp

Then we had to import the csr from above question and sign it. I signed it by right clicking on it and choosing strongsignstrong. Then we had to export both the CA and the signed key and verify it. But what do they mean exactly My guess is to verify that the certificate is signed by the CA, but Im having problems with that. We have to use openssl x509 for that, but it just isnt working.p  pWhen I right click the signed key and export it as a PEM file, in that file is the followingp  precode BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST  MIIC6......

Negative 849 pThis is purely academical question not related to any OSp  pWe have x86 CPU and operating memory, this memory resembles some memory pool, that consist of addressable memory units that can be read or written to, using their address by codeMOVcode instruction of CPU we can move memory from  to this memory pool.p  pGiven that our program is the kernel, we have a full access to whole this memory pool. However if our program is not running directly on hardware, the kernel creates some virtual memory pool which lies somewhere inside the physical memory pool, our process consider it just as the physical memory pool and can write to it, read from it, or change its size usually by calling something like codesbrkcode or codebrkcode on Linux.p  pMy question is, how is this virtual pool implemented I know I can read whole linux source code and maybe one year I find it, but I can also ask here p  pI suppose that one of these 3 potential solutions is being usedp  ul liInterpret the instructions of program very ineffective and unlikely the kernel would just read the byte code of program and interpret each instruction individually, eg. if it saw a request to access memory the process isnt allowed to access it wouldnt let it.li liCreate some OS level API that would need to be used in order to read  write to memory and disallow access to raw memory, which is probably just as ineffective.li liHardware feature probably best, but have no idea how that works the kernel would say dear CPU, now I will send you instructions from some unprivileged process, please restrict your instructions to memory area code0x00ABC023  0xDEADBEEFcode the CPU wouldnt let the user process do anything wrong with the memory, except for that range approved by kernel.li ul  pThe reason why am I asking, is to understand if there is any overhead in running program unprivileged behind the kernel lets not consider overhead caused by multithreading implemented by kernel itself or while running program natively on CPU with no OS, as well as overhead in memory access caused by computer virtualization which probably uses similar technique.p

Negative 849 pIve got a number of files that I am reading the contents into a char array, I would like to store the contents I read from each file in an array of characters so that I could access the separate character arrays file contents by index, I am not sure of the syntax on how to do this. p  pMy understanding is that I need to set each of the memory addresses in my patterns array to one memory address per char array to the char array stored in patternData but I do not know how to set this.

Also, in order to not have a direct reference of a view model by doing codenew blablaViewModelcode in a view model, I have a singleton codeFlowManagercode class that I call in the codeICommandcode function, and the instantiation is done in that class rather than the view model.p  pThe problem with this approach, is that for each view I add to my application, I have to add a datatemplate in codeApp.xamlcode, an codeenumcode entry in my codeFlowManagercode class and a new codecasecode in my codeswitchcode in the codeChangePagecode function, a new ICommand in my codeMainViewModelcode, on top of adding the code for the actual view and creating its own view model.p  pHere is an example of how I handle the flow of my applicationp  pIn strongMainWindow.xamlstrong, I have the following layoutp  precodeltWindow xClassEveExcelMineralUpdater.Views.MainWindow         xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation         xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml         xmlnsviewModelsclrnamespaceEveExcelMineralUpdater.ViewModels         TitleMainWindow Height720 Width1280gt     ltGridgt         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt             ltColumnDefinition Width15gt             ltColumnDefinition Widthautogt             ltColumnDefinition Width85gt         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt          ltStackPanel Grid.Column0gt             ltButtongtMarketStat RequestltButtongt             ltButton CommandBinding ChangeToQuickLookCommandgtQuickLook RequestltButtongt             ltButtongtHistory RequestltButtongt             ltButtongtRoute RequestltButtongt             ltButtongtSettingsltButtongt         ltStackPanelgt          ltSeparator Grid.Column1 StyleStaticResource xStatic ToolBar.SeparatorStyleKey gt          ltContentControl Grid.Column2 ContentBinding CurrentViewModel gt     ltGridgt ltWindowgt codepre  pIn strongApp.xaml.csstrong I start the application by creating the main window and settings its codeDataContextcode and codeMainViewModelcode propertyp  precodeMainWindow mainWindow  new MainWindow MainViewModel mainViewModel  new MainViewModel mainWindow.DataContext  mainViewModel mainWindow.ViewModel  mainViewModel  FlowManager.Instance.AppWindow  mainWindow  mainWindow.Show codepre  pIn strongMainViewModel.csstrong, I handle a button request to change the codeCurrentViewcode property with an codeICommandcode like followsp  precodeprivate void ChangeToQuickLookobject param      FlowManager.Instance.ChangePageFlowManager.Pages.QuickLook  ... public ICommand ChangeToQuickLookCommand      get  return new RelayCommandChangeToQuickLook   codepre  pIn strongFlowManager.csstrong, I have an codeenumcode that lists all the pages views in my application, and the actual codeChangePagecode function that will change the codeCurrentViewModelcode property in my codeMainViewModelcodep  precode Only one view is implemented for now, the rest are empty for now public void ChangePagePages page      IViewModel newViewModel  null      switch page              case Pages.MarketStat             break         case Pages.QuickLook             newViewModel  new QuickLookRequestViewModel             break         case Pages.History             break         case Pages.Route             break         case Pages.Settings             break           AppWindow.ViewModel.CurrentViewModel  newViewModel  ... public enum Pages      MarketStat,     QuickLook,     History,     Route,     Settings  codepre  pFinally, in strongApp.xamlstrong, I have the list of all my datatemplates for all my viewsp  precodeltApplication xClassEveExcelMineralUpdater.App              xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation              xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml              xmlnsviewModelsclrnamespaceEveExcelMineralUpdater.ViewModels              xmlnsviewsclrnamespaceEveExcelMineralUpdater.Views              StartupAppOnStartupgt     ltApplication.Resourcesgt         lt Pages DataTemplates gt         ltDataTemplate DataTypexType viewModelsQuickLookRequestViewModelgt             ltviewsQuickLookRequestView gt         ltDataTemplategt     ltApplication.Resourcesgt ltApplicationgt codepre  pLike I said, this works well, but I can see some scalability problems as I have to modify several parts of my code in order to add a view in the application.

Negative 849 pIn VB.net, I am looking to determine the underlying database table name from a RunTime type Linq query row. I am trying to create a generic routine for deleting rows in ListBoxes, whose object values are query rows. I need the actual table name using DeleteOnSubmit. It works fine, of course, if I hardcode the table name in, but thats what I am trying to avoid so that I can use a single routine for many listboxes. I just simply hook the KeyUp event. Heres my current codep  precodePrivate Sub LbxMenuItemsKeyUpsender As Object, e As KeyEventArgs Handles LbxMenuItems.KeyUp, LbxCategories.KeyUp     Dim lbx  DirectCastsender, ListBox     If e.KeyCode  Keys.Delete Then         Dim msg  Delete  amp lbx.SelectedItems.Count amp  selected rowss         If MsgBoxmsg, MsgBoxStyle.YesNo  MsgBoxStyle.Exclamation ltgt vbYes Then Exit Sub         Dim lbxType As Type  lbx.SelectedItems0.GetType         For Each sel In lbx.SelectedItems             dbh.MenuItems.DeleteOnSubmitsel    lt MenuItems IS THE TBL NAME I NEED            Next         dbh.SubmitChanges     End If End Sub codepre  pFor example emlbx.SelectedItems0.GetTypeem yields the fullname emDataAdmin.MenuCategoryem.  The Table name that I am looking for is MenuCategories. dbh is the dataContext qualifier.p  pI hope that I am explaining this well enough for someone to try to assist. Thank youp
Negative 849 pWondering if I could get some input from anyone on a concept that I am working on at the moment.p  pBasically I am looking to somehow be able to allow a user to input the URL of a web service and then I want to programmatically call the service and store the configuration in a SQL db to be able to then use the functions to call later.p  pThe concept is to be able to allow a user to specify a webservice as a data import type so I can transform the data that comes from the web service into a data structure of my own by allowing the user to map fields from the import source the web service to the output source a staging database.p  pI suppose much in the way like SSIS has the Web Service Task.p  pI am having a play with wsdl.exe and disco.exe and considering using System.CodeDomp  pIf anyone has done anything like this then would love to know your thoughts and any point in a better direction is always appreciated.p  pThanks for the collaboration in advancep

Negative 849 pIm working on an embedded project which involves IO on memorymapped FPGA registers. Pointers to these memory regions need to be marked codevolatilecode so the compiler does not optimize out reads and writes to the FPGA by caching values in CPU registers.p  pIn a few cases, we want to copy a series of FPGA registers into a buffer for further use. Since the registers are mapped to contiguous addresses, codememcpycode seems appropriate, but passing our codevolatilecode pointer as the source argument gives a warning about discarding the codevolatilecode qualifier.p  pIs it safe and sane to cast away the codevolatilecodeness of the pointer to suppress this warning Unless the compiler does something magical, I cant imagine a scenario where calling codememcpycode would fail to perform an actual copy. The alternative is to just use a codeforcode loop and copy byte by byte, but codememcpycode implementations can and do optimize the copy based on size of the copy, alignment, etc. p

Negative 849 pI have a class which takes in a stream of events, and pushes out another stream of events. p  pAll of the events use Reactive Extensions RX.

Negative 849 pIm curious about the best practices for using a different regex engine in place of the default Perl one and why the modules Ive seen are pragmas and not a more traditional OOprocedural interface. I was wondering why that is.p  pIve seen a handful modules for replacing the Perl regex engine with PCRE reenginePCRE, TRE reengineTRE, or RE2 reengineRE2 in a given lexical context. I cant find any object oriented modules for creatingcompiling regular expressions that use a different back end. Im curious why someone would choose to implement this functionality as a pragma rather than as a more typical module. It seems like replacing the perl regex engine would be a lot harder depending on the complexity of the API it exposes than making an XS script that exposes the API that PCRE, TRE, and RE2 already provide.p

So when another thread updates dataSource exactly at the moment when dataSource is assigned to temp, does the GC increase the counter on the right memory block The other thing is compilerCLR optimization. I assign dataSource to temp and use temp to access data members. What does the CLR do Does it really make a copy of dataSource or does the optimizer just use dataSource to access .a and .b Lets assume that between temp.a and temp.b are lots of instructions so that the reference to tempdataSource cannot be held in a CPU register. So is temp.b really temp.b or is it optimized to dataSource.b because the copy to temp can be optimized away. This is especially important if another thread updates dataSource to point to a new object.p  pDo I really need volatile, lock, ReadWriterLockSlim, Thread.MemoryBarrier or something else The important thing to me is that I want to make sure that temp.a and temp.b access the old datastructure even when another thread updates dataSource to another newly created data structure. I never change data inside an existing structure. Updates are always done by creating a copy, updating data and then updating the reference to the new copy of the datastructre.p  hr  pMaybe one more question. If I dont use volatile, how long does it take until all cores on all CPUs see the updated referencep  hr  pWhen it comes to volatile please have a look here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions72275whenshouldthevolatilekeywordbeusedincWhen should the volatile keyword be used in Cap  hr  pI have done a little test programmp  precodenamespace test1    public partial class Form1  Form      public Form1  InitializeComponent       Something sharedObj  new Something      private void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e        Thread t  new ThreadDo           Kick off a new thread       t.Start                                running WriteY        for int i  0 i lt 1000 i          Something reference  sharedObj          int x  reference.x  sharedObj.x         System.Threading.Thread.Sleep1         int y  reference.y  sharedObj.y          if x  y            button1.Text  x.ToString    y.ToString           Update                           private void Do        for int i  0 i lt 1000000 i          Something someNewObject  sharedObj.Clone  clone from immutable         someNewObject.Do         sharedObj  someNewObject  atomic                   class Something      public Something Clone  return SomethingMemberwiseClone      public void Do  x System.Threading.Thread.Sleep0 y      public int x  0     public int y  0     codepre  pIn Button1click there is a forloop and inside the forloop I access a datastructureobject once using the direct shareObj and once using a temporarily created reference.

Negative 849 pI have an MVC form which contains text data as well as a file. When I submit the form, the expected outcome is that the file is uploaded and upon success, a modal will appear and display the value returned from the controller. However, what actually occurs is that the file is uploaded, but the controller never returns the value to the ajax function. Instead, the text is displayed to the browser on a new, empty page with the url path pointing to the controller. The ajax call being used is based upon the following post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10899384uploadingbothdataandfilesinoneformusingajaxUploading both data and files in one form using Ajaxa.p  pIf however, the ajax call uses codedata form.serializecode, the ajax call returns the desired values and a modal appears.

Negative 849 pIm generating random falling SKSpriteNode objects in my scene. I noticed that sometimes the falling objects fall smoothly and sometimes they are jittery. It is more noticeable when I set the gravity at 4. Ive been trying to figure out this erratic behavior but no success. However, I noticed also that the choppiness seems to disappear when I transition to a different scene and then transition back  sometimes I have to do it several times. The scene is running at a consistent 60fps even if the objects fill the screen. Ive checked for areas where I might be bogging down the flow but even if I remove those possible areas it did not help. Has anyone experienced this behavior before Thanks in advance. p

Now its broken. The new UI has changed superficially, reflecting, I presume, new CSS. I can alter codeinputElementcodes default value so I know Im still hitting the element correctly. Could new CSS or possibly the apps own jQuery be preventing my function from working If so, is there a solutionp  pstrongUpdatestrong Just to clarify. My question isnt, Why isnt the code below not working Its, Can injecting an codeonkeyupcode into an input form that does not currently have this attribute be broken by some other feature of a web app, such as CSS or jQuery I have as, Maximillian Laumeister suggests, tried the codeaddEventListenercode method, and this works. Though, is this foolproof Is there a foolproof solution at all Or is it more of test with each update to the app and reevaluatep
