Positive 1605 pI currently have a disagreement going on with my 2nd year JAVA professor that Im hoping yall could help solvep  pThe code we started with was thisp  precode   public T peek            if isEmpty        .........        public boolean isEmpty             return topIndexlt0     codepre  pAnd she wants us to remove the codeisEmptycode reference and place its code directly into the codeifcode statement i.e. change the peek method contents to codeiftopIndexlt0.......code to Make the code more efficient. I have argued that a the runtimecompile time optimizer would most likely have inlined  the codeisEmpty call, bcode even if it didnt, the 510 machine operations would be negligible in nearly every situation, and c its just bad style because it makes the program less readable and less changeable.p  pSo, I guess my question is Is there any runtime efficiency gained by inlineing logic as opposed to just calling a method I have tried simple profiling techniques aka long loop and a stopwatch but tests have been inconclusive.    p

Positive 1605 pShort Versionp  pBefore the TLDR section, my main question is this, what is difference when building to profile using instruments then a regular build that would result in reduced CPU load of my app by over 200p  pWhen building to run, it uses well over 200 CPU as reported by activity monitor, but with everything else the same, when building for profiling, using the Time Profiler, it reduces the CPU load down to  lt5, which is a dramatic orders of magnitude difference.p  pTLDR Versionp  pAs an exercise to learn Cocoa, Swift and DSP yes all three at once, I am working on writing a simple radio scanner OS X application using the cheap rtlsdr dongles.p  pI have written a simple Swift wrapper around librtlsdr, a simple UI to be able to set the frequency, and a couple of simple DSP routines.  My wrapper around librtlsdr uses an NSOperationQueue and my DSP routines use GCD queues in order to move the IO and CPU intense routines off the main thread  queue.p  pCurrently, everything is working to the extent that I can successfully demodulate an AM transmission.p  pI have implemented a simple lowpass FIR filter and while working on the algorithm, I was surprised when I realized that I couldnt use much more than about 30 coefficients before my filter routine started taking too long and the audio became choppy.  As well, Activity Monitor shows up to 300 CPU usage for my app, which seems crazy high considering my filter contains nothing but a nested loop to do some multiply and accumulate operations.  Anything higher than about 40 coefficients and the UI becomes unresponsive.p  pFor the DSP minded, its a decimating filter where I am using the entire sample set for filtering 960000 sps , but only filtering the samples that I need for the rate reduction 48000, using a rectangular windowed sinc function for the coefficients, pre computed.  Not the most efficient algorithm, but on my quad core i7 Macbook Pro and iMac, it should still scream.p  pTo get some insight on where my program was using up all the CPU cycles, I decided to give Instruments a go.  ProductProfile, choosing the Time Profiler and running my app gave my some interesting information.  p  p1 My filter routine was NOT using the most CPU cycles.br 2 Activity monitor showed that my app  wasnt even at 5 CPU usagep  pSo I decided to find out how far I can stress things before I see any stress on the CPU and I was up to a 50,000 tap filter before it started to be noticeably choppy and the CPU usage went close to 300.  So to recap, normal build and run, I max out at about 3540 filter taps profile build and run, I max out at about 50,000 filter taps.p  pAlso worthy of note, while profiling with 50,000 filter taps, the UI still responds instantly and I can change frequency, start  stop the radio and it has choppy audio.  During a normal run, the UI starts to freeze just as soon as I start the radio with no audio, and that happens after I get to only about 50 taps.p  pAgain, why the dramatic difference in CPU usage between between running while profiling, and running just a standard build whats different aside from the elevated privileges for Instruments and what do I need to do to make it the normal behavior for my appp  pJEp

Positive 1605 pIve got some code that is using a codePoolcode from Pythons codemultiprocessingcode module.  Performance isnt what I expect and wanted to profile the code to figure out whats happening.  The problem Im having is that the profiling output gets overwritten for each job and I cant accumulate a sensible amount of stats.p  pFor example, withp  precodeimport multiprocessing as mp import cProfile import time import random  def worki     x  random.random     time.sleepx     return i,x  def workargs     out  [None]     cProfile.runctxout[0]  workargs, globals, locals,                     profiles.out  mp.currentprocess.name     return out[0]  pool  mp.Pool10  for i in pool.imapunorderedwork, range100     printi codepre  pI only get stats on the last job, which may not be the most computationally demanding one.  I presume I need to store the stats somewhere and then only write them out when the pool is being cleaned up.p

Positive 1605 pIm dealing with the ageold devil of timing resolutions on Linux as part of a homework assignment. To cut a long story short, Im trying to find the mechanism that can give me the best resolution on an Intel i5 quadcore 3.2 GHz machine running Linux version 2.6.32.p  pI looked up different methods, and finally am comparing performances of codeclockgettimecode and codeRDTSCcode. Ill probably post another question for the latter, but heres what I did to find the average time required for a codeclockgettimecode callp  precodeclockgettimeCLOCKMONOTONIC, amptsstart forloopindex  0 loopindex lt 1000000 loopindex     clockgettimeCLOCKMONOTONIC, ampts clockgettimeCLOCKMONOTONIC, amptsend codepre  pcodets, ts1, ts2code are of type codestruct timespeccode. I later calculate differences between codetsendcode and codetsstartcode and divide by 1000000. This gives me 26ns.p  pI then thought of trying something elsep  precodeclockgettimeCLOCKMONOTONIc, ampts1 ts2  ts1 whilets1.tvsec  ts2.tvsec ampamp ts1.tvnsec  ts2.tvnsec     clockgettimeCLOCKMONOTONIC, ampts2 codepre  pcodets1code and codets2code are again of type codestruct timespeccode. I print the difference in times when the loop terminates. Now, this gives me 100ns.p  pIm confused as to what the right approach is here, and what is the right value. Is there some fundamental point Im missing in how the times should be interpreted Also, this got me confused about the term resolution. Does 26ns100ns indicate that the actual resolution of codeclockgettimecode on the system is 26ns100nsp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI also varied the loop count of the first method and used smaller numbers. The first call takes a long time 140ns, the second lesser and so on until it evens out at 26ns for all subsequent calls. Im guessing this is due to caching. Does this affect the correct valuep

Positive 1605 pwe have developed a multi user ntier WCF application where the middle tier is hosted in IIS. Application pool identity is set to a predefined single user.

Now, we can filter out only SQL calls from that user. But, as far as I know, ADO.NET connection pooling is based on connection string. So, connection pool is created for each user because, technically, every user has its own Connection String only Application Name field is different, but it doesnt matter.

Negative 1605 pIn my Core Data model, Ive got a relationship called codelistItemscode which links to several codelistItemcode entities, each with a codestringValuecode attribute. Ive created a control which is essentially a list of codeNSTextFieldscode, one for each list item. The control is bound to codelistItemscode properly, and Ive set it up so that pressing the return key creates a new field directly under the currentlyedited one and changes the focus to the new field. So, essentially, to add a new item, the user presses Return.p  pLikewise, if the user ends editing and the currentlyedited field is empty, the field is removed as in, empty fields only appear during edit mode, so to speak. This works pretty well. Basically, in my codelistItemcode NSManagedObject subclass, I do the followingp  precode Dont allow nil values if value ampamp [[self.recipe ingredients] count] gt 1  for EAIngredientRef ingredient in [self.recipe ingredients]  if [[ingredient sortIndex] integerValue] gt [[self sortIndex] integerValue]  [ingredient setSortIndex[NSNumber numberWithInteger[[ingredient sortIndex] integerValue]1]]                   [[self managedObjectContext] deleteObjectself]     return    Code to handle if it is a real value codepre  pThe problem I am encountering is that each time a row is deleted this way, it registers with the undoManager. Thus, if I edit a row, press Return which creates a new row, and click away to end editing, the row disappears. However, if I then undo, the empty field reappears. My goal is to have delete operations involving empty fields be ignored by the undoManager.p  pHow would I go about this Ive tried using code[[[self managedObjectContext] undoManager] disableUndoRegistration]code and the associated codeenableUndoRegistrationcode in several spots such as codedidTurnIntoFaultcode, but I suspect that the undo registration might be happening prior to that methodp

Negative 1605 pimg srchttpwww.pafo.netexample.png altalt text Hellop  pI dont know what i should title this question regarding ASP.NET and saving a webpage layout. I will be referring to BBC just illustrate what i am after. a hrefhttpnews.bbc.co.uk relnofollowhttpnews.bbc.co.ukap  pThe page will have around 10,00020,000 visitors each day. I have one MS SQL 2008 database and i am programming ASP.NET C 3.5.p  pI am building a magazinepaper like BBC but in a smaller format, now the administrator has to be able to style the general pages like Economics, Politics etc and place what articles are to be display and how to display them. On the BBC page when im looking at it now you have one big article on the first row, then 2 smaller on the second and third row, then a box with FEATURES, VIEWS, ANALYSIS. I attached a picture with the areas painted in different colors. I want to allow the administrator to modify the appearance of the general pages and thus place the news in an arranged order.p  ul liThe first problem i have is how to save it for optimized speed, both for fetching the webpage but also for editing it. So i thought that saving the page in XML in a XML document would allow me to add the functionallity that i want, since i can modify the XML and also add new tags if i expand the program. But the problem is then loading it to the client, i could create a .aspx page on the server when the administrator presses save or i could dynamically load it every time someone wants to display the webpage. Any ideas on performanceli ul  pSo the flow is 1 Administrator changes the layout on a specific page in the admin panel, he or she changes what article to show and where to place them. Single, Next to another article etc 2 The administrator then saves the changes. 3 The user can now view the updated layout 4 The administrator can load back the layout to make further changes.p  ul liThe second problem is that i have small boxes on the right side, the contents in these boxes could either reflect the articlewebpage or it could be something different. The administrator chooses what boxes to use when heshe creates the article. Now, how to save that information and load the boxes efficient. The boxes, when they are created, faces the same problem as above, how to save them in a good manner so the articles can load them fast. I was thinking about saving the information, like above, in a XML document. When the administrator creates an article i then save the box idnumber in a certain table in the MS SQL 2008 database with an idnumber to the correct article. But the same problem arises, should i dynamically load the boxes or create every box as a Web User Control and then load it, something like  WebControl1234 boxControl  WebControl1234LoadControlData path  boxidfromsqlserverli ul  pAny ideasp

Negative 1605 pI have a Drupal site with pages indexed by a Google Mini search appliance.p  pEarlier in the week I noticed that a bunch of links were marked as indexed, but excluded because there was a print this page link back to the same page and had a relnofollow.

When I search for other terms, they do show up. In other words, I know that GSA is working. p  pWhen I search at searchnodeTERM [Drupal default search], I get the Drupal results which are different[pages with the term shows up]. This makes me pretty sure Im hitting GSA.p  pAny ideas on why the newly indexed pages arent showing up in GSA searchp  pEDITSolved There were a couple of issues. Previously the search used an xslt to handle how it displayed the page, and where it sent the queries on the page when you hit submit on the appliance, not the submit button on the site.  The queries string was passed in the old format to the site, which then gave a 404 same thing as if you do a search of bookstore.site.com, and origin.site.com.  More of a cant get there from here sort of problem than anything having to do with searching.  Ive removed the xslt, so it just used the default google look and feel, and lets us do nice, generic searches against the appliances database.p  pHowever, there were still some weird search results coming back that the Drupal module could not parse and The logs were getting hit with simplexmlloadstring [function.simplexmlloadstring]  in sitesallmodulesgoogleapplianceGoogleMini.php on line 318.p  pI experimented with some querystring variables and commenting out the line that sets the Output encoding and all seems to work. The line in question is in googleappliance.module on line 322 p  precodegmgtsetOutputEncodingutf8 codepre

Negative 1605 pWell, Im trying to make ASP.NET urls looking userfriendly, like it was explained a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2003840makeurlinaspnetuserfriendlyin this questiona. So I created an ASP.Net form, and placed codeasptextboxcode and codeaspbuttoncode on it. Also I set codeonclientclickcode attribute to call JS function which navigates to smart URL by setting codewindows.location.hrefcode. In Firefox it works well but in IE and Opera the browser first navigates to smart url but then it closes connection and sends a postback using an asp.net form action.p  pI tried to solve it using html button instead of server ones. It works, but the problem is that it cant be set as default for the asp.net form. So if user clicks on it, it does its work. But if the user just presses enter when form is active, the form performs its action, so the button is not pressed and JS url rewriting doesnt occur. So how can I solve this problemp  pMy JS looks like thisp  precodefunction searchRedirect      var query  getcolSearch     window.location.href  colSearchq  query.value     return false  codepre  pand in search.aspx i havep  precodeltform idMainForm runatserver methodgetgt         ltaspTextBox idcolSearch runatserver Width615px CssClasssearchLinegtltaspTextBoxgt         ltinput idButton1 typebutton valueSearch onclicksearchRedirect classsearch gt codepre  pI also tried with codeaspbuttoncodep  precodeltform idMainForm runatserver methodget defaultbuttonsubmitReqBtngt         ltaspTextBox idcolSearch runatserver Width615px CssClasssearchLinegtltaspTextBoxgt         ltaspButton runatserver TextSearch IDsubmirReqBtn              onclientclicksearchRedirect CausesValidationFalse              EnableViewStateFalse UseSubmitBehaviorFalsegtltaspButtongt ltformgt codepre

Negative 1605 pCant get any love anywhere on this and its pretty hard to believe.  Live streaming and a buffer on a NetStream do not mix.  Why  The docs dont say you cant do this.p  pThe playback gets hosed.  Buffer is supposed to fill to what you set it to before playing.  Instead though, about half the time, the player starts playing right away and disregards the buffer time youve set.  Then you get caught in short buffering and rebuffering cycles that degrades the playback experience.p  pGive it a shot yourself.  Here is the simplest of live streaming video players.  No frills.  Just connect it to your live stream by changing the defaultURL string and stream name in the ns.play statement. p  pRun it in Flex debug mode.  It will check and print the ns.bufferLength property every second.  The buffer is set to 20 secs currently.  Last time I ran it, I never made it above 2 seconds in the buffer.  Player started playing right away instead of buffering the full 20 secs first. Sometimes you get to the full 20 and sometimes not.  Why  No idea.p  pCan you not buffer a live stream reliably or is there something wrong with the codep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltmxApplication xmlnsmxhttpwww.adobe.com2006mxml layoutabsolute     initializeinitgt     ltmxScriptgt         lt[CDATA[             import flash.media.Video             import flash.net.NetConnection             import flash.net.NetStream             import mx.core.UIComponent              private var vidVideo             private var videoHolderUIComponent             private var ncNetConnection             private var defaultURLStringrtmpyourstreamingserverurlhere             private var nsNetStream             private var msgBoolean              private var intervalMonitorBufferLengthEverySeconduint              private function initvoid                              vidnew Video                 vid.width864                 vid.height576                  vid.smoothing  true                                             Attach the video to the stage                               videoHolder  new UIComponent                 videoHolder.addChildvid                 addEventListenerSecurityErrorEvent.SECURITYERROR, onSecurityError                 this.addChildvideoHolder                 connect                           public function onSecurityErroreSecurityErrorvoid                              traceSecurity error                            public function connectvoid                              nc  new NetConnection                 nc.client  this                 nc.addEventListenerNetStatusEvent.NETSTATUS, netStatusHandler                 nc.connectdefaultURL                                            public function netStatusHandlereNetStatusEventvoid                              switch e.info.code                      case NetConnection.Connect.Success                         traceConnected successfully                         createNS                                          break                     case NetConnection.Connect.Closed                         traceConnection closed                                          connect                         break                       case NetConnection.Connect.Failed                         traceConnection failed                                          break                     case NetConnection.Connect.Rejected                         traceConnection rejected                                                            break                       case NetConnection.Connect.AppShutdown                         traceApp shutdown                                                           break                               case NetConnection.Connect.InvalidApp                         traceConnection invalid app                                                             break                                                                                                                                                             public function createNSvoid                              traceCreating NetStream                 nsnew NetStreamnc                 nc.callFCSubscribe, null, liveproduction  Only use this if your CDN requires it                 ns.addEventListenerNetStatusEvent.NETSTATUS, netStreamStatusHandler                 vid.attachNetStreamns                  Handle onMetaData and onCuePoint event callbacks solution at httptinyurl.commkadas                 See another solution at httpwww.adobe.comdevnetflashquickstartmetadatacuepoints                 var infoClientObject  new Object                 infoClient.onMetaData  function oMDvoid                  infoClient.onCuePoint  function oCPvoid                           ns.client  infoClient                  ns.bufferTime  20                  ns.playyourstreamname                     ns.addEventListenerAsyncErrorEvent.ASYNCERROR, asyncErrorHandler                 function asyncErrorHandlereventAsyncErrorEventvoid                      traceevent.text                                     intervalMonitorBufferLengthEverySecond  setIntervalmonPlayback, 1000                           public function netStreamStatusHandlereNetStatusEventvoid                              switch e.info.code                      case NetStream.Buffer.Empty                         traceBuffer empty                          break                     case NetStream.Buffer.Full                         traceBuffer full                         break                     case NetStream.Play.Start                         tracePlay start                         break                                                                         public function monPlaybackvoid                   Print current buffer length                 traceBuffer length   ns.bufferLength                           public function onBWDonevoid                   Do nothing                                      public function onFCSubscribeinfoObjectvoid                          Do nothing.

Currently Im attempting to achieve this using the following Windows API callsp  precodeSetActiveWindowhandle SwitchToThisWindowhandle, true codepre  pPreviously I also had codeShowWindowhandle, SWSHOWMAXIMIZEDcode executing before the other 2, but removed it because it was causing strange behavior.p  pThe problem Im having with my current implementation is that occasionally the focus will not be set correctly. The window will become visible but the top part of it will still appear grayed out as if it wasnt in focus.p  pIs there a way to reliably do this which works 100 of the time, or is the inconsistent behavior a sideeffect I cant escape Please let me know if you have any suggestions or implementations that always work.p

Negative 1605 pI have the following problem in a Visual C 9 program. Theres a huge object that logically contains several subobjects. I can either store the subobjects inside the object or store pointers to subobjects allocated separately.p  pThe key point here is that theres always one instance of suboject of each type in one outer object  it is always of the same size and its lifetime is exactly the same as of the outer object, so the two choices above are logically identical  the program structure and logic dont change.p  pHeres how my thought developsp  ol liIf I store subobjects inside traversing to them will become slightly faster, but thats not what I care about the most  I profiled the program and thats not the bottleneck.li liIf I store subobjects inside the outer object will occupy more memory, so Ill allocate larger blocks and that might fragment memory more compared to allocating lots of similarly small subobjects separately  freed memory blocks might be less reusable Im not sure, I just suppose that.li liOf course, less allocations will make the program faster, but thats not very important  again I profiled the program and allocations time is not a bottleneck.li liSince each allocation induces a memory overhead with larger objects I will in fact consume less memory and that is good for my program that works with huge amounts of data.li ol  pMeanwhile memory fragmentation is what really bothers me  I need my program to be very stable and able to run from months continuously.p  pHow do I make my decision Are there any methods for deciding whether I should choose smaller object or bigger objects given the considerations abovep

Negative 1605 pI was delighted to discover that Android 2.2 supports the positionfixed CSS selector. Ive built a simple proofof concept, herep  pa hrefhttpkentbrewster.comandroidscrollerscroller.htmlhttpkentbrewster.comandroidscrollerscroller.htmlap  p... which works like a charm.  When I attempt to add an INPUT tag to my header, however, I hit trouble.  On focus, every device Ive tried so far clones the INPUT tag, gives it an infinite Zindex, and repaints it on top of the old tag.  The clone is in roughly the right position, but most of its parents CSS including, of course, positionfixed is ignored.  The cloned INPUT tag is the wrong size and shape, and when I scroll the body of the page, it scrolls up and off the screen.  p  pOnce its off screen, hilarity ensues.  Sometimes the device will force the scrolling part of the body back down so the cloned blank is back in view sometimes the keyboard goes away even though the visible box seems to remain in focus sometimes the keyboard cannot be dismissed even though the INPUT blank is clearly blurred.  Heres an example you can run on your Android 2.2 device to see whats happeningp  pa hrefhttpkentbrewster.comandroidinputstylebughttpkentbrewster.comandroidinputstylebugap  pStyling inputfocus has not done the trick for me yet, nor have many different bruteforce attempts to listen for focus and blur with JavaScript and do the right thing with focus and the keyboard.p  pThanks very much for your help,p  pKentp

Negative 1605 pI am trying to understand my way around polymorphism in Java. I created a parent class that has too many common methods that all children will use in the same manner.  brEach of the subclasses children all share static information, These variables or information will be used in the methods declared only in the parent. br The problem wish accessing static variables from Parent methods seems not really possible,  brIts a solution to declare the common information per instance but since there will be 1000s of instances its such a waste of memory.  br A simple elaboration of what i mean is the following code p  precode    class testParent      static int k     public void print            System.out.printlnk                  class testChild2 extends testParent           static              testChild2.k 2              public class testChild1 extends testParent     static              testChild1.k  1           public static void mainString[] args               new testChild1.print         new testChild2.print          new testChild1.print        codepre  pthe output i expect was br 1br 2br 1.br but what happens is   br 1br 2br 2br One might think that on the initiation of each subclass the static variables of this subclass is set and then all methods referring to this subclass has access to the corresponding k value.  br But what actually happens is that all subclasses edit in the same static variable that is shared along all subclasses and hence destroys my whole point of using static variables for each subclass and its instances and using commmon methods in the Parent accessing these variables.p  pbrbr Any idea how can this be done p

In Ubuntu, you get a screenshot of each application, plus its window manager icon. In Windows you get the window  manager icons, and so on.p  pimg srchttpi53.tinypic.com2mflvf7.png p
Negative 1605 pI have a TextBox in my .NET application that control various settings in my application.  The values entered are likely remain the same on each execution of the app.  Id like the data to be retained so on the next launch of the application the values are already populated. p  pWhats the best way to handle this  Write out the values to a file on ApplicationExit and then reread them on launch  Theres got to be a more clever way...p  pThanks. p
Negative 1605 pI have an old Windows app, compiled in Visual C 6.0, that I need to get working on x64 platforms. The app actually seems to be ok since I used a pretty careful data typing but it interacts with an Outlook addin that Ive had to recompile as an x64 dll just to get it to load into Outlook 64bit edition.p  pThe addin sends data to the main application using a WMCOPYDATA message, the data sent is a struct as followsp  precode DWORD dwData1 char pszData2[32] DWORD dwData3  codepre  pThings arent working so I did some debugging, and it turns out that when the 64bit addin sends data to the 32bit program, the DWORDs are coming in as 64 bits 8 bytes each, throwing the struct off completely since the program expects 32 bit DWORDs 4 bytes. Looking at the data in memory, I can see the extra 4 bytes for each of the DWORDS, before and after the 32byte string.p  pNow doing some research here on Stack Overflow and elsewhere. I see that DWORD supposedly has retained 32bit length even on x64 platforms as a choice by Microsoft. And doing a TRACEsizeofDWORD in 64bit land I get 4 bytes as expected.p  pSo what could be causing my 64bit addin to send 64 bits with each DWORDp  pI worked around this by changing my struct definition to use DWORD32 but Id like to get the fundamental concept in order to know where else this might be affecting my code.p

Negative 1605 pI am working on a peer lending application that has several types of users ie. borrowers, lenders, sponsors, etc that have different fields. Moreover, some of these users can belong to two things ie. lenders can also be sponsors.

Im sure this is a WCF issue because if I call the first method outside of WCF, I get lt 1 second performance.p  pAnyone have any idea what might be causing the initial delayp  pEDIT Here is the OnStart code for the Windows Servicep  precodeprotected override void OnStartstring[] args     serviceHost  new ServiceHosttypeofServiceMethods,new Urihttp111.111.111.1111111Psn      Add an endpoint and the methods the endpoint will support.    serviceHost.AddServiceEndpointtypeofIServiceMethods, WcfConfiguration.GenerateBindingEnumerations.WcfBindingType.HTTP,      WcfConfiguration.CreateMexDataserviceHost    serviceHost.Open  codepre  pAnd here is the GenerateBinding methodp  precodepublic static System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding GenerateBindingEnumerations.WcfBindingType bindingType     System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding binding  null     BasicHttpBinding httpBinding  new BasicHttpBinding    httpBinding.Security.Mode  bindingType  Enumerations.WcfBindingType.HTTP  BasicHttpSecurityMode.None  BasicHttpSecurityMode.Transport    httpBinding.OpenTimeout  new TimeSpan0, 0, 30    httpBinding.SendTimeout  new TimeSpan0, 0, 30    httpBinding.ReceiveTimeout  new TimeSpan0, 0, 30    httpBinding.Security.Transport.ClientCredentialType  HttpClientCredentialType.None    httpBinding.ReaderQuotas.MaxStringContentLength  httpBinding.ReaderQuotas.MaxStringContentLength    httpBinding.MaxReceivedMessageSize  httpBinding.MaxReceivedMessageSize    httpBinding.ReaderQuotas.MaxArrayLength  1048576    httpBinding.MaxBufferSize  httpBinding.MaxBufferSize     binding  httpBinding    break        return binding   public static void CreateMexDataServiceHost host    ServiceMetadataBehavior behavior  new ServiceMetadataBehavior    behavior.HttpGetEnabled  true   host.Description.Behaviors.Addbehavior   host.AddServiceEndpointtypeofIMetadataExchange, MetadataExchangeBindings.CreateMexHttpBinding, mex  codepre

Negative 1605 pAn application I am trying to support is currently running into unique constraint violations. I havent been able to reproduce this problem in nonproduction environments. Is it reasonable, for debugging purposes, to create a rule trigger that will in effect just copy every insert to a different table  So in effect the new table will be the same as the old table without a constraint, hopefully.  p  pThe application is using Spring to manage transactionality, and I havent been able to find any documentation relating rules to transactions.  After the violation, whatever is written so far in the transaction is rolled back  will this affect the rule in any way This is Postgres 8.3.p

Negative 1605 pI have a static library in which Im calling OpenGL extension functions via GLEW. As the project is being built in GCC NetBeans 7.0, and GLEWs binaries are only shipped in VisualC flavor, I have built GLEW 1.7.0 as a static library, with GCC. I would also be interested why this is necessary, as GLEW seems to be pure C, in which ABI and crosscompiler compatibility isnt an issue AFAIK.p  pIn my static library I define GLEWSTATIC and NOSDLGLEXT as project preprocessor directives D, then Ip  precodeinclude GLglew.h include SDLSDL.h codepre  pThe static library is then linked against in a test application, which also links against the following libraries, in the following orderp  precodemystaticlibrary mingw32 glew32 opengl32 SDLmain SDL codepre  pThis setup gives me two undefined reference errors in my static libraryp  precodeundefined reference to impglewGetStringi undefined reference to impglewInit codepre  pIndeed, these are two calls made to GLEW functionality, in the static library. There are however other calls that the linker used to complain about before DGLEWSTATIC, yet seem to be ok now.p  pI wasnt able to improve the situation by swapping the order of linkage to opengl32 and glew32 some more undefd refs to codewgl...code calls. Furthermore, GLEWSTATIC and NOSDLGLEXT used to be defined in the test application but that has been removed and doesnt seem to matter.p  pWhy do the remaining errors occur and what can I do to get rid of them, i.e. how can I use GLEW in GCC with SDLp

Negative 1605 pIm trying to serialize and deserialize codeflex.messaging.io.amf.ASObjectcode to JSON. codeASObjectcode extends HashMap and adds an additional type property.

Although Zack gives a detailed script to run on the embedded system, I was unable to run the script due to the lack of development tools compiler and headers installed in the root file system. In lieu of installing these tools, I simply compiled the nice test program that Zack provided in the script and used the strace utility.  The strace utility was run on the embedded system.p  pAt last, I think that I understand what is happening.p  pThe bad binary was transferred to the embedded system over FTP, using an SPItoEthernet bridge KSZ8851SNL. There is a driver for the KSZ8851SNL in the Linux kernel.p  pstrongIt appears that either the Linux kernel driver, the proftpd server software running on the embedded system, or the actual hardware itself KSZ8851SNL was somehow corrupting the binary.

Negative 1605 pIm working on a Lua menu, and I got Menu class which creates instances like thisp  precodefunction Menunewlabel, action, open     local inst           parent  self,         label  label,         action  action,         open  open or self.defaultOpenState,         current  false          setmetatable inst,  index  self       if self.subMenus then         table.insert self.subMenus, inst      else         self.subMenus   inst      end     return inst end codepre  pThats not all the code obviously for the menu, but thats enough to explain my problem. The menu is working just fine, how ever, printing it isnt. Problem is, Im using recursive method to print out all the submenus, but it keeps on printing the very first menu over and over again. I know what causes it, but not sure how to fix it. Heres the codep  precodefunction Menudrawindent     local indent  indent or 0     if self.label then         if self.current then             print string.rep     , indent  .. selfgetDirectoryMark .. lt .. self.label .. gt          else             print string.rep     , indent  .. selfgetDirectoryMark ..   .. self.label          end     end     if self.subMenus and self.open then         for k, v in ipairs self.subMenus  do             vdraw indent  1          end     end end codepre  pAnd the problem is I suppose it is, correct me if Im wrong, that on line 10 codeif self.subMenus ...code it is always true. Theres always a subMenu, even if there wasnt, since the menu self doesnt find a submenu, it checks for its metatable, which has subMenu, and then on line 11, it does the for loop for its metatables submenus. Which means, itll draw itself again. And again. And again. So is there a way to bypass a metatable, in just one place Or am I even right, is the repeated printing caused by thatp

Negative 1605 pI am working on a problem, and I am not sure if Im doing this properly, or if I even have the right approach at all.  My code, so far, just gives me segfaults.p  pI have a simple little receipt writing program to practice some C concepts, one of them being file io in binary.  I have a couple arrays holding data one holding strings of a service type, the other holding corresponding double costs.  I have a little menu, and the writing in binary part goes fine.  However, I am not sure how to read these back from the file.p  pI am currently using a structure to hold various data members customers name, total charges, etc., and I want to write all of the services they chose, along with their corresponding prices, to a file, and then be able to read them back.  These are currently stored in vectors in the structure.p  pI think I understand how to readwrite strings tofrom a binary file write the length of the string, then the data, then read the length back, then read that many bytes into a string.  But how do I do this with a vector  I understand how it can be done with, say, a vector of fixedsize members i.e. ints, but what about a vector of strings  In this case, the members do not have a set size, so I am not sure how to read them back.p  pIs this even possible  If anyone could point me in the right direction, that would be extremely helpful.  There was a similar forum posting a year or so ago, but it didnt help me much.  p  ptldr  How do I read a variablesize vector of variablelength strings from a binary filep

Negative 1605 pI looked around internet and was always looking like from previous 6 months for a script that could load flash contentgame while showing an actual loading screen But I always received a few answersp  ol liIt is not possible to show an actual loading with Javascript.li liYou can do it only by adding action script to the flash file maybe they are talking about FLAli liWhy Dont you show a fake loading screen that appears and show some seconds and then disappears the most annoying this of such screen is that they first make user load 15 seconds then the flash starts loading, if it starts loading those 15 seconds still it is worth something it is good BUT making them wait double is really badli ol  pBut at last I found something that I was looking forever. A Jquery based script that shows actual loading shows ad too and uses swf Object to talk to flash content too. It is really awesome as it doesnt require you to do changes to the FLA, it is just pure outer environment dealing. So now the question arises whats the issue then. Well the issue is that this script was made for pixels, it works if you are using width and height for flash in pixels, while I cant use pixels as I am using ages this way user have ability to go full screen optionally by pressing f11.p  pSo as you can see I want that script to work with ages that is my problem, but as I mentioned earlier I didnt came here right away I have been asking for help Actually Begging in over 14 forums from previous few months and of course some good people still exists some people helped me to reach a certain point but it didnt solve the problem So now I will provide some Markupp  pHere is link to the script that I am talking about a hrefhttpwww.balloontowerdefense.netjquerypreloaderjquerypreloader.html relnofollowhttpwww.balloontowerdefense.netjquerypreloaderjquerypreloader.htmla It is the link to the creator of this scriptp  pHere is a link to working example flash based on Pixels  a hrefhttpwww.balloontowerdefense.netjquerypreloaderexample.html relnofollowhttpwww.balloontowerdefense.netjquerypreloaderexample.htmla p  pSome one helped me here but it didnt work 1 month ago. The person told me that I should change the plugin Named as Preroll the changes preferred were thesep  pModify the plugin to use usersupplied units instead of pixels. To do this, you will need to modify two functions in the plugin, applygameiframe and showgame.p  precodeapplygameiframe should be changed to  var applygameiframe  function    var gc  settings.gameframe   var iframe  ltiframe gt.attr     id settings.gameid,     src settings.swf,     frameborder 0,     scrolling no,     marginwidth 0,     marginheight 0   .css     heightsettings.height     width settings.width      gc.appendiframe   return true   showgame should be changed to  var showgame  function      var ac      settings.adframe     var game    settings.gameframe     ac.hide     game.css     width settings.width,     height settings.height       codepre  pOnce those changes are made, the inline CSS should be set to whatever you supply as parameters i.e., 100, 50em, etc..p  pI did the changes told to be done as described above to the Preroll plugin and after that this is what I get a hrefhttpfiles.cryoffalcon.comMyFootPrintfullscreen.html relnofollowhttpfiles.cryoffalcon.comMyFootPrintfullscreen.htmlap  pNow if you let the game load as loading screen appears all is well done except that in the end, the game doesnt appear, it loads but when it should skip and make the game appear at that time something goes wrong.

Which is not good if you dont want to leak the raw contents of the folder for any reason.p  pIt gets messier on TCGF if I dop  pServletContext.getResourcefolder I get the same result as ServletContext.getResourcefolder. Even weirder if I do ServletContext.getResourcefolderhello.html I still get back a URL but then get a FileNotFoundException when trying to open the stream.p  pWhat am I missing this seems like a basic need to be able to tell if a resource represents a folder or a file, yet I can see no reliable cross Java EE container method to do this.

So basically the height of the div is very short because it hasnt gotten the response text yet.

Negative 1605 pI am trying to get the list of connected components in a graph with 100 million nodes. For smaller graphs, I usually use the a hrefhttpnetworkx.lanl.govreferencegeneratednetworkx.algorithms.components.connected.connectedcomponents.htmlnetworkx.algorithms.components.connected.connectedcomponents relnofollowconnectedcomponentsa function of the Networkx module in Python which does exactly that. However, loading a graph with 100 million nodes and their edges into memory with this module would require ca. 110GB of memory, which I dont have. An alternative would be to use a graph database which has a connected components function but I havent found any in Python. It would seem that Dex API Java, .NET, C has this functionality but Im not 100 sure. Ideally Im looking for a solution in Python. Many thanks.p

Negative 1605 pWeve been implementing a Dynamics CRM 2011 solution where one of the requirements was to print out a bespokestyled form containing subgrids and charts. The short story is that clicking on a print link which calls the codewindow.printcode method throws up a series of JavaScript errors. These, however, are nonfatal and clicking through each will allow the form to be printed OK.p  blockquote   pLine 73 br   Char 24234 br   Error The value of the property isNull is null or undefined, not a Function object.br   URL httpsaks7.crm4.dynamics.comstaticformscontrolsimg.lu.htcver115872263p      pnote that the double colon above was intentionalp blockquote  pOne of our early thoughts was that the problem was down to unsupported customisations, so as a test I created a new entity with a basic form. On the ribbon I added a print button which calls the codewindow.printcode method. The result is exactly the same. Ive also replicated the issue on CRM Online.p  pThe upshot is that either using codewindow.printcode is unsupported, or weve found a bug or both. Is there a solution to thisp

Negative 1605 pI have just started using geb with webdriver for automating testing.  a hrefhttpwww.gebish.orgmanual0.7.0pages.htmlcache relnofollowAs I understand ita, when I define content on a page, the page element should be looked up each time I invoke a content definition.p  precodeIn the content block of SomeModule, which is part of a moduleList on the page itemLoaded      waitFor loading.displayed   loading  .loading    in the page definition moduleItems index gt moduleList SomeModule, modulelist gt .item, index  in a test on this page def item  moduleItemssomeIndex assert item.itemLoaded codepre  pSo in this code, I think code.loadingcode should be called repeatedly, to find the element on the page by its selector, within the context of the modules base element.  Yet I sometimes get a StaleElementReference exception at this point.  As far as I can tell, the element does not get removed from the page, but even if it does, that should not produce this exception unless codecode is doing some caching behind the scenes, but if that were the case it would cause all sorts of other problems.p  pCan someone help me understand whats happening here  Why is it possible to get a StaleElementReferenceException while looking up an element  A pointer to relevant documentation or geb source code would be useful as well.p

Doing so also proves difficult because I actually have another thread that is calling codeSynccode to make sure some things are set before acquiring resources the first thread should process first.p  pDo I need to wrap the innards of these functions with a trycatch and use a codeVCLSynccode to get the exception to the main thread myself  Is is there a better way to check for exceptions in a main thread idle loop of some kindp  pstrongEdit 1strongp  pAnother thought I had was to create a loops whose only job is to check the IAscynCall references for exceptions and use that to Raise the exception to the main thread, rather than duplicating that code in every post.

Negative 1605 pWhat Id like to do is make an ajax request to some url whose server I dont have access to.  When the ajax call returns Id like to get the url of the page I returned from.

I know, after reading some similar posts, that the browser follows the requests transparently and doesnt return the url.  p  pHowever I was wondering if that was because those ajax requests were originating in the page.  If I were to originate my ajax request in the browser via some browser extension would it be possible to get the returned url  p  pIf this is not possible, are there alternative ways of going about this  I thought that iframes might work make an iframe whose source is the target url and see if it gets redirected.  However, I noticed that some websites dont act normally, out of security protocol, inside of an iframe, so this doesnt seem like the best solution.  Another thought was to use cURL, which Id really like to not have to do. Is what Im trying to do even possible in cURLp  pThanks for the help.p

Just the action of turning the control to the right or left is.p  pAny tips for the good way to achieve this would be appreciated p  pPart of the code here pp  precodeprivate RotateTransform rotateTransform  void ManipulationStartingobject sender, ManipulationStartingRoutedEventArgs e     e.Handled  true     var image  sender as Image    var container  image.Parent as UIElement     var localCenter  new Pointimage.ActualWidth  2, image.ActualHeight  2    var pivot  new ManipulationPivotlocalCenter, 20    e.Pivot  pivot      rotateTransform.CenterX  image.ActualWidth  2     rotateTransform.CenterY  image.ActualHeight  2      e.Container  container      void ImageManipulationDeltaobject sender, ManipulationDeltaRoutedEventArgs e         e.Handled  true        var image  sender as Image        double newAngle       var valueDrawline  1       if e.Delta.Rotation lt 0                  valueDrawline  1           newAngle  rotateTransform.Angle  1  e.Delta.Rotation              else                  valueDrawline  1           newAngle  rotateTransform.Angle  1  e.Delta.Rotation               rotateTransform.Angle  newAngle       image.RenderTransform  rotateTransform    codepre  pp The real problem is coming from the direction which is not constant. Ex when I turn the control with the mouse or finger doing rounds from left to right, the value is supposed to be incremented by 1. This is not working well with the current code as the value is mostly incremented by 1 but also with 1 even if I still turning in the direction. To be more clear, lets imagine I want to draw an horizontal line with my control. I need to turn it in right to draw to right and the inverse to draw the the left. With this code, its going to the correct direction but with a lot of steps back along the path of the line...p  pTxs in advancep

Negative 1605 h2The basic concept of what I am doingh2  pComplete coalition structure formation problemCombinatorial auctions. p  pGiven a set of N agents, which disjoint subsets of the set of agents yields the best outcome.p  pE.g. codeAgents  a,bcode and their valuesp  ul licodea  2codeli licodeb  3codeli licodea,b  4codeli ul  pIn this instance the coalition of codea,b  5code would give the best outcome, where it is the pairwise disjoint subset of codea,bcode.p  pSo in short the problem is about splitting a set and check if any of the splittings sum is greater than the original set. This part is as good as it goes in terms of generating splittings and how I represent my data.p  pHow I represent the data is basicly an array of values, where the index is the set configuration a set is represented as an integer.p  pFor the example abovep  pcodeint val[4]  0,2,3,4code where set p  ul licodea  01  index 1codeli licodeb  10  index 2codeli licodea,b  11  index 3codeli ul  pSo the set acts as an index in the value array.p  pThe problem is that this gives random memory access, given a large number of agents for which there are code2ncode values to consider. p  h2SKIP HERE FOR THE MEMORY ACCESS PROBLEMh2  pE.g. in the environment of 20 agents, given the set of two elements  code10000000000000000001code the value for element code10000000000000000000code is 1048575 indexes away from code00000000000000000001code which is 4194300 bytes away in memory, which represent 32767 cachlines of 128 bytes of distance. Hence, horrible access pattern.p  pThe solutions I have tried looking for involve ordering the indexes in terms of cardinalityHamming weight p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13542794hammingweightbasedindexingHamming weight based indexinga p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13554747determinthelexicographicdistancebetweentwointegersDetermin the lexicographic distance between two integersap  psuffer from arithmetic overhead that to my calulations will overshadow the penalty from random access. Especially a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13542794hammingweightbasedindexingHamming weight based indexinga as it uses many dependant calculations which gets serilized and blocks the thread.p  pAs a last resort I ask here again, is there any methodI know about coalescing, which is hard to do for this problem to improve the access times when your solution is depandant on random access, or is it a helpless statep  pCurrently I am around 45 instruction replay overhead becouse of that, and changing the blocksize gives no notable result. And yes I try hide the latency by calculating several coalitions per thread, which work somewhat.p

Negative 1605 pI have an app that bumps the user out to Apples maps to get directions to a business location, and Im passing latlong.  Pretty simple, the URL Im using is the followingp  pa hrefhttpmaps.apple.commapsdaddrlat,long relnofollowhttpmaps.apple.commapsdaddrlat,longap  pThis of course works fine, but the client doesnt like the latlong showing when the user gets to the maps, since it doesnt look very user friendly.  They would prefer the business name which we have available to actually show there.  I informed them that this wouldnt work if we just passed in the business name alone, since Apples maps may not know about that particular business location.  p  pHowever, they wanted to know if it was possible to somehow have it still show the business name in the destinationaddress, alongside the latlong.  Something like the following  Business Name lat,long, where the business name is ultimately ignored and latlong used.

Negative 1605 pI am currently trying to figure out, how to do release management with git flow in a scenario where I have one git repository with about 15 projects in two solutions plus scripts for the database.p  pEach solution basically contains one project that will result in an executable and more than 10 projects containing base functionality used by both solutions like DAL, SAP access wrapper etc.br Solution one is an application with UI for the users.br Solution two is a Windows service.br The release of the two solutions and the database are not in sync. This means that frequently only one ore two of the three are being released. This results in different version numbers. For example, the UI is released quite frequently, the service is released seldomly. The database somewhere in between. So, the UI could have version 2.1.15, the service 2.1.1 and the database 2.1.5.p  pNow, what to do with the shared projects Should they use the version number of the UI or that of the servicebr How would I account for the fact that a change in one of the shared projects wouldnt automatically trigger a release of both solutions This means that at the same time, the production environment contains two different versions of the same projects. This somehow needs to be reflected in the repository.p  pI am a little bit lost here, any advice, experience etc. would be appreciated.br I am free to structure the repository and code base in any way and I can create additional repositories if that helps.p
Negative 1605 pemEDIT I wanted to make this clearer before reading what I originally wrote below... I am creating a website using three sections that float left of one another. I use links to scroll from one section to the other. When scrolling to that section, I want the background of that section to fit to the browser screen size. If the browser is THEN resized when still viewing that section of the page, I want the background to snap to the window and continue to fill the screen.  At the moment, this only happens with the section that is all the way on the left.em p  pIm not sure if this is possible, but I figured Id see. Ive been working off of the onepage strategy on this website tutorial  a hrefhttpjqueryheaven.com201208buildingaonepageportfoliowithjqueryslide relnofollowhttpjqueryheaven.com201208buildingaonepageportfoliowithjqueryslideap  pWhile this tutorial uses many different sections, Im only making my website use 3 or 4. Either way, Im trying to figure out how to get each section to fit the browser window regardless of how big or small you resize the window. So far, on the tutorial, and on the site that Ive made, only the section furthest to the left fits with the window. The rest of the sections do not resize to fit. p  pHere is the code that I have so far p  pHTML Ive omitted the contents that were inside the  containersp  precodeltdiv idmaingt  ltsection idartwork classboxgt ltsectiongt   ltsection idhome classboxgt ltsectiongt   ltsection idcontact classboxgt ltsectiongt  ltdivgt codepre  pCSS tried using 100 widths and heights for the sections, as well as backgroundsizecover, but nothing has workedp  precode.box  floatleft   artwork  background b4c620 width100 height100 backgroundsizecover   home  background 58267a with100 height100 backgroundsizecover   contact background b4c620 width100 height100 backgroundsizecover  codepre  pScripts taken from the tutorial as well, which, as I mentioned, only adjusts the size on the first section box, artwork, and not the rest.

Negative 1605 pI want to implement a JSplitPane horizontal split where the right component has a constant width i.e. when the divider is dragged it will jump back to the correct size, unless the divider is dragged far enough right in which case the right most component will have zero width. p  pTo redisplay the right component the user can then drag the divider far enough to the left.p  pIve got this mostly working, but when I resize the window depending on how much and how fast I change the window size the divider jumps reveal or hide the right component, where as what I want is that it should not change state ie if the right component was not visible then it should remain invisible and vice versa. p  pIve tried heaps of things but the main obstacle is that there seems to be no way of knowing weather the divider was dragged by the user via mouse or if the code my divider logic andor JSplitPane internal logic changed the divider position. p  pHere is a self contained test case, run it and try to drag the horizontal divider to hide and reveal the right side panel and with those hiddenshown try to resize the window.p  pDoes not work as intended on Mac OS X  Java 1.6 Apple or Java 7 Oracle.

Negative 1605 pI do have a thirdparty program, which uploads files to a webserver. These files are images, in different folders and with different names. Those files get references into a database. The program imports new images and upload those to those folders. If there is an existing file, it just takes the name and add a special counter, create a new reference in the database and the old one will be removed. But instead of removing the file as well, it keeps a copy.p  pLets say, we have a imagefile name 109101.jpg. There is a new version of the file and it will be uploaded with the filename 1091011.jpg. This goes further till 109101103.jpg for example. Now, all the 103 files before this one are outdated and could be deleted.p  pDue to the fact, that the program is not editable and thirdparty, I am not able to change that behavior. Instead, I need a Shell script, which walks through those folders and deletes all the images before the latest one. So only 109101103.jpg will survive and all the others before this number will be deleted. And as a side effect, there are also images, with a double underscored name only these, no tripple ones or so. For example 109013351.jpg is the original one, the next one is 1090133511.jpg and now its at 10901335124.jpg. So only 10901335124.jpg has to survive.p  pRight now I am not even having an idea, how to solve this problem. Any ideasp

Now that Apple even rejects apps that use the older SDK and contain an iPhone 5 launch image, I see no need to keep my iPhone 3GS on iOS4.p  pEven though the latest sw for iPhone 3GS is iOS6, will an upgrade to iOS5 be successful through the server verification.

Negative 1605 pIve Googled my pants off on this one and whilst Ive found many similar QampAs, none seem to address the specific problem I have.p  pIm using VC10 but I guess this applies to VC9, VC10 and VC11.

Annoyingly I keep getting the LNK4204 error, for examplep  precodemylib.libanobjectinmylib.obj  warning LNK4204 [PATH TO USER APPLICATION INTERMEDIATE DIRECTORY]vc100.pdb is missing debugging information for referencing module linking object as if no debug info codepre  pFine.  I understand what this is saying.  My initial reaction was well, its going to be trivial to turn this off.  However I can find no way of preventing this.  Things that have surprised me arep  ol liI cant find any option in the library project setting to compile without debug info even in release  and by God I could swear there is a wayli liI cant find any option in the user application project settings to instruct the linker that I know theres no debugging info and it should just get on and do what its toldli ol  pIs there any good solution to this  Presumably its not uncommon to want to link to a library with no debug info but produce debug info for the binary Im creating  What about linking to kernel libraries and crts, surely thats exactly what happens  I cant believe Ive never found this problem before, it seems to obvious can you tell Im exasperated.p  pFYI, before people say it, I really dont want to ship release libs with debugging info as I want to minimize the risk of reverse engineering.  I know that some people will say that youll regret it when a user gets a bug and you have no pdb info, but trust me when I say I dont care about that.p  pAll help appreciated and apols if this is a duplicate but I really couldnt find an identical problem.p  pCheers, Andrewp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI believe Ive got around the problem but Im not entirely sure why it works.  Definitely need to look into this some more.  But in short, I can and in fact need to build with VC9.  Note that VC9 actually gives you an extra option of Disabled for Debug Information Format, which doesnt appear in VC10 this may explain some of my confusion. p  pNow the solution seemed to be to create a debug version of the library Im fine with that but keep debug info Disabled.  When I do this I get no complaints.  Its quite strange as in both cases theres no debug info the cases being linking debug to release and debug to debug, however when linking to the debug lib I get no warnings. Bit of a mystery so far, if I get time Ill investigate further.  Maybe Im missing something p

Negative 1605 pThe first point in the a hrefhttpsemver.org relnofollowSemantic Versioning Specificationa states that compatible software must declare a public API.p  pIm wondering how gems establish this public API. It seems that its typically done through the readme see a hrefhttpsgithub.comrailsrailstreemasteractiverecord relnofollowActiveRecorda, for example, which doesnt feel like it draws a strict boundary between the public API code and the rest. An example of a gem that does this better is the a hrefhttpsgithub.comsferiktwitter relnofollowTwitter APIa, placing its public API code in an a hrefhttpsgithub.comsferiktwittertreemasterlibtwitterapi relnofollowAPI directorya, but even there the line is grey, as the public APIs configure method is defined in a hrefhttpsgithub.comsferiktwitterblobmasterlibtwitter.rb relnofollowtwitter.rba, outside the API directory.p  pAs a potential contributor to a gem that attempts to stick to semantic versioning which is most of them, given we have tools like bundler, Id like to know which methods are part of the public API, and which arent. Maybe I have to look through more source code, but are there guidelines somewhere for clearly defining your public APIp

So I found some hints for solving this problem. It was to use LDPRELOAD. Some people said that LDPRELOADs value is in somewhere of stack not only in environment variable area of stack. So I set LDPRELOAD and search it and found it using gdb.p  precode export LDPRELOADhomecoffeetest.so  gdb q abcde gdb b main Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048476 gdb r Starting program homecoffeeabcde  Breakpoint 1, 0x8048476 in main  gdb xs 0xbffff6df 0xbffff6df      C001homecoffeetest.so gdb xs 0xbffffc59 0xbffffc59      LDPRELOADhomecoffeetest.so gdb q The program is running.

Negative 1605 pI have been trying to implement a simple graph search on google app engine.  this is my first ever gae project and python project, and graph search so learning by doing it wrong, probably.  I have a large cvs file of connections between vertices uploaded as an ndb databasep  precodeclass Connectionndb.Model     vertexid  ndb.StringProperty     connectedto  ndb.StringProperty codepre  pthere are about 8000 vertices, each of which is connected to a few others, so there are a total of about 14,000 connections in total, so 14,000 entities in the connection ndb.  already i guess it would be more efficient to store each vertix as a single entity with a repeated connection variable, but i am not sure how to upload my cvs data properly to do that.  also in that case i could use the ids as the keys, and use gets instead of fetches below, which may speed things upp  panyway, I am doing a breadthfirst search, based on some python code from this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8922060breadthfirstsearchtracepathBreadthfirst search trace patha, so i used that and fiddled with it a bit to get it to workp  precodedef bfsorigin, destination    queue  []  push the first path into the queue queue.appendstrorigin.vertexid count  0 while queue      get the first path from the queue     if lenqueue 1         path  queue.pop0         node  path     else         path  queue.pop0         nodepath[1]                     get the last node from the path       path found     if node  destination.vertexid         return path     if countgt21000         return count      enumerate all adjacent nodes, construct a new path and push it into the queue     nodeconnsConnection.queryConnection.vertexid  node.fetch10             for nodeconn in nodeconns         count  count1         newpath  []         newpath.appendpath         newpath.appendstrnodeconn.connectedto         queue.appendnewpath   codepre  pSo anyway, it works for origin and destination close to each other 6 or 7 connections apart, but seems to scale very badly for vertices far apart.p  pis this because it has to read all the data from the datastore  i dont understand quite why its so slow even with a cap of 21000 tries, like above, it takes 50 seconds or so on my SSD laptop before timing out count21,000 on an origin and destination which are quite distant.p  pcombined with all the reads to the ndb database that are going on, this cant be good to run online i have only been running it locally.p  pso... i guess my questions are,  is there some fundamental flaw in the algorithm above  is it a stupid idea to run a graph search based on an ndb in google app engine is there some more sensible way to represent the graph  maybe theres some existing packages that can do this for me I found some code for dijkstras algorithm, but not really sure how to interface it with my datap  pThanksp

Negative 1605 pI am relatively new to MySQL and am looking for a way to run a MySQL update every 10 minutes. Basically there is a central CSV file that is updated every ten minutes on a server that we grab the data from. I am trying to set up a MySQL table that will read that CSV file and load it into the MySQL table every ten minutes.p  pI know that you can link a MySQL table to a CSV file directly using load data. My confusion comes with the actual automatic updating. Ive done some research and read about cron jobs which will perform automated tasks at set intervals.

Negative 1605 pConsider a running codeHadoopcode job, in which a custom InputFormat needs to communicate return, similarly to a callback a few simple values to the driver class i.e., to the class that has launched the job, from within its overriden codegetSplitscode method, using the new codemapreducecode API as opposed to codemapredcode.p  pThese values should ideally be returned inmemory as opposed to saving them to codeHDFScode or to the codeDistributedCachecode. p  pIf these values were only numbers, one could be tempted to use codeHadoopcode counters. However, in numerous tests counters do not seem to be available at the codegetSplitscode phase and anyway they are restricted to numbers.p  pAn alternative could be to use the codeConfigurationcode object of the job, which, as the source code reveals, should be the same object in memory for both the codegetSplitscode and the driver class.p  pIn such a scenario, if the codeInputFormatcode wants to return a say positive long value to the driver class, the code would look something likep  precode In the custom InputFormat. public ListltInputSplitgt getSplitsJobContext job throws IOException      ...     long value  ...  A value gt 0     job.getConfiguration.setLongvalue, value     ...     In the Hadoop driver class. Job job  ...  Get the job to be launched ... job.submit  Start running the job ...  while job.isComplete      ...      if job.getConfiguration.getLongvalue, 1              ...          else              continue  Wait for the value to be set by getSplits           ...       codepre  pThe above works in tests, but is it a safe way of communicating valuesp  pOr is there a better approach for such inmemory callbacksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe inmemory callback technique may not work in all codeHadoopcode distributions, so, as mentioned above, a safer way is, instead of saving the values to be passed back in the codeConfigurationcode object, create a custom object, serialize it e.g., as JSON, saved it in HDFS or in the distributed cache and have it read in the driver class. I have also tested this approach and it works as expected.p

Negative 1605 pFrom what I understand, instructions and data in an object file all have addresses. First data item start at address 0 and first instruction also start at address 0. p  pThe relocation table contains information about instructions that need to be updated if the addresses in the file change, for example if the file is linked together with another. Line A, in the example below, would be in the relocation table. I dont think B would be in the relocation table, since the address of label equal is relative to B.

When I click the search button in my page it calls the console application and if I change the range slider value within strong1 secstrong and call the codeexecode again the output displayed is the previous output and after a while again the output is changed tp the current output.p  pI guess this is because the previous console application isnt terminated in the second time so it displays the same output and in a while gives the correct output.

Negative 1605 pI have a simple Ext JS form 4.1, but it seems reproducible in 4.2. The form contains some codetextareacodes and I want to use the codeemptyTextcode attribute on one of the textareas.

Negative 1605 pBit of a coding newbie here and looking for some advicep  pI have the following method  a simple weight converter for kilograms to pounds, thats part of a larger console application. The user selects what conversion scheme they want and then they enter their weight and it will convert it.

The code is as followsp  precode    public static double KilogramsToPoundsstring weightInKilos              Convert parameter to a double for calculation         double kiloWeight  Double.ParseweightInKilos          Convert Kilograms to Pounds         double poundWeight  kiloWeight  2.20462         try                      if kiloWeight lt 0                              throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException                          else                              return poundWeight                               catch ArgumentOutOfRangeException argEx                      Console.WriteLineargEx                   return 0       codepre  pHowever, when this runs it will always return 0 because it requires a double as its return type. So you get the ArgumentOutOfRange Exception, AND a 0 because it requires a double.p  pI was just wondering if there was any way to basically say strongif you enter a number below 0, you get this error message, but if you enter a valid positive number, you will get the correct numerical resultstrong Because it seems no matter what you will need to provide a numerical value for it to be happy as well as the error message, or else you will get a strongNot all code paths return a valuestrong error.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p  pNote  I should add the string parameter weightInKilos is taken from the users console input.

Negative 1605 pId like to do this on Rubys Datamapperp  pCreate a table, then execute an SQL statement raw after. My DB right now is SQLite. I checked out a hrefhttpdatamapper.orgdocscallbacks.html relnofollowhttpdatamapper.orgdocscallbacks.htmla but it doesnt have anything on adding a callback after the table is constructed. Im saying this because I need to add a constraint directly or something like an alter table after all of my tables have been generated. The constraint is a uniqueindex over multiple keys from another table. Something like thisp  precodeclass Score belongsto pageant, uniqueindex gt singlescore belongsto candidate, uniqueindex gt singlescore belongsto category, uniqueindex gt singlescore belongsto judge, uniqueindex gt singlescore end codepre  pAnyway what I want to happen is that each pageantcandidatecategoryjudge combination should be unique. The uniqueindex thing doesnt work unless I include another field that isnt linked to another table. So I just thought of adding a constraint via raw SQL which I would be doing if I wasnt using an ORM.p

Negative 1605 pIm attempting to implement a properties panel as a secondary window to a NSDocument based app.  The implementation shows a NSWindow via a NSWindowController.p  pThe goal is that properties modifier in the secondary window the Properties window should be undoable using CMDZ if either of the main the document or the secondary properties window are active.p  pFor some reason, this is eluding me.p  pMy current implementation  test is very basic. To test this idea, I have a NSSlider bound to a property called aValue, exposed on the Properties NWindowController. This does something like thisp  precode void undoAValueUsingintoldValue     self.aValue  oldValue    voidsetAValueintaValue      ifaValue  aValue      NSLogValue is now d, aValue     [[self.undoManager prepareWithInvocationTargetself] undoAValueUsingaValue]     [self.undoManager setActionNameRa]     aValue  aValue    codepre  pThus any change to the property records an undo action.p  pThe problem is, no undo appears... its as if its not registered, or if the active menu item is looking at some other undo manager. CMDZ just produces a beep aka noop.p  pThe full code to this simplistic example is here a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu421935TestAppTest.zip relnofollowhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu421935TestAppTest.zipap  pThe idea is that you click the button to view the properties panel, make changes to the topmost slider no other slider has undo implemented and you emshouldem be able to CMDZ t undo it.p  pbtw if you look at the example code youll see ive tried setting the custom window manager.undoManager to be the document.undoManager.

Negative 1605 pI am new in ios development. When I use UITableView, I implement data source and delegate together. like the following two methods p  precode  Data source method   NSIntegertableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersection    Delegate method   voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath  codepre  pHowever, if I am understand correctly, table view does not hold any data, and it only store enough data to draw the rows that are currently visible. Therefore, for instance, if I have 10 data in table, and only shows 5 currently. That means delegate method runs 5 times, but before delegate method runs 5 times, data source method already runs 10 times to get the number of rows. And the reason we use data source is to manage the content that presents using a collection view. So my question is, how does data source manage the content Does data source object store all of those table view informationsince it runs before delegate and it knows the total numbers of table view If it stores information of table view, it seems conflict with delegate since table view delegate does not hold any data, right p  pOne more question is in what situation we just use data source because we can create custom delegate right Is there situation we only create custom data source Since Ive seen data source always comes with delegate....

Negative 1605 pThe X11 protocol defines an atom as a 32bit integer, but on my system, the Atom type in  is a typedef for unsigned long, which is a 64bit integer. The manual for Xlib says that property types have a maximum size of 32 bits. There seems to be some conflict here. I can think of three possible solutions.p  ol lipIf Xlib treats properties of type XAATOM as a special case, then you can simply pass 32 for format and an array of atoms for data. This seems unclean and hackish, and I highly doubt that this is correct.pli lipThe manual for Xlib appears to be ancient. Since Atom is 64 bits long on my system, should I pass 64 for the format parameter even though 64 is not listed as an allowed valuepli lipRather than an array of Atoms, should I pass an array of uint32t values for the data parameter This seems like it would most likely be the correct solution to me, but this is not what they did in some sources Ive looked up that use XChangeProperty, such as SDL.pli ol  pSDL appears to use solution 1 when setting the NETWMWINDOWTYPE property, but I suspect that this may be a bug.

Negative 1605 pIve been reading about Core Data all day and am trying to put a couple logic pieces together.p  pIn my app, a window loads a table filled with data single strings.  When the user installs the app, I want a list 100200 items to serve as the default list, but also give them the ability to delete default items as well as add new items.p  pFrom what Ive been reading, the easiest way to accomplish this is to have a Property List that I load one time the first app load filled with the default data, and import that list into my Core Data model.  From there the user does all the manipulation via Core Data.  Does that sound right andor is there a more efficient way of loading default data  And does this make sense for populating and editing the tablep  pGet Core Data values  Build array from values  Display array in table  User addsdeletes array item  Array item is matched to Core Data value and is addedremoved from the databasep  pThank youp

Negative 1605 pIm currently working with Symfony2 and Doctrine2 to build a website which has several bundles of my own. Those Im having trouble with are CoreBundle and UserBundle.p  pI want to make a Log manager to store several actions in DB. So, I made an abstract entity codeLogcode in the codeCoreBundlecode with the attributes I needed, and made the mapping with doctrine. No problem there.p  pNow, I would like to extend this class in the codeUserBundlecode for each type of codeLogcode that I want to store. I did that, added the codeInheritanceTypecode to the codeLogcode class, as well as the codeDiscriminatorColumn and DiscrimiatorMapcode. The entities being in another bundle, I fully named them in the map.p  pThe problem is that when I try to it, Doctrine throws me an exception  codeEntity class EPUserBunbleEntityLogLoginUserLog used in the discriminator map of class EPCoreBundleEntityLogLog does not exist.codep  pI dont get it because I already did something like this twice.

This happens when I open up either a UIImagePickerController or a custom modal dialog. I am consistently able to reproduce this issue. I even used a program called Reveal to see whats happening with the UITabBarButtons and the label inside of them, but I cannot see any difference in the views before and after properties.

I saw a few issue similar to this and tried codebundle exec rake assetsprecompilecode as well as editing the production.rb a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5287805whyrailsservereproductionmakesitnoroutematchesandstylesheetnWhy quotrails server e productionquot makes it quotNo route matches quotquot and stylesheet not loadinga file but it does not work. I am looking for the solution to do this through the command and not through code.p  pEDIT codebundle exec rake assetsprecompilecode did somewhat work The problem is that I created an extra css file called main.css which isnt importing, but everything else worksp

Negative 1605 pIm trying to do something a bit weird with a bunch of maps in c. If I call them dictionaries, I apologize. Used to working in Python 2.7. p  pI have fifty maps, each one representing the top five growing cities in a state. The key is the city name, the mapped value its rate of growth. EX.Alaska anchorage 112.55 boonies 106.22... The five fastest growing cities in each state. What I want to do is compare all of these mapped values, find the five with the highest, and print out the name of the city they belong to. p  pIn addition to that fact Im comparing 250 numbers to start with, I dont know the mapped values or keys until the program runs. Its taking this data from a massive txt file of over 19,000 lines, finding the five highest per state, and then creating a dictionary for each state. p  pI have no idea on how to access all of these values without knowing what their keys are, or even how to compare all of these numbers at once. I need more help with the former than the latter, but anything will be helpful.p  pEDITp  pAttempting to answer all the questions askedp  pHow I got the fifty maps is from a custom class I wrote. The txt file with the data is too large to be read all at once, so I wrote a class that will take read a certain section of the file, find the names and values of the top five in the section, and return it as a map with five pairs the name of the city and its value. With each state being a section, it will return fifty maps, which each contain five pairs. So map Alaska will have city growth value city2 growth value2... Then there will be map Arizona, map Alabama, etc. At the moment, Im calling the function 50 different times with different sections to read. Each time I call the function, it returns the map of the top five pairs. I hope thats clearer.p  pI need the data as a map because I need the name to print out at the end, in addition to the growth value to compare and find the best. However, now that Im thinking about it more, Im considering adding a function in the class that keeps a vector of all the city names and one of just the growth values. I could take the rate vector and compare, then find its corresponding name in the other vector with some kind of counter variable. Not sure if that would work any better or any easier, but a possibility that comes to mind.p

Negative 1605 pI have a clientserver which is using SSL to communicate. p  pThe keystore JKS in the client contains emtwoem certs with different key usage. Cert 1 is for SSL communication and cert 2 is for signing datap  ol liOne cert has codeKUkeyEncipherment,digitalSignature, EKUclientAuthcodeli liOne cert has codeKUnonRepudiation,digitalSignaturecode li ol  pWhen I run with this, it picks the first one correct. If I remove the first cert from the JKS, it picks the cert with codenonRepudiationcode when connecting to the server wrong. p  pThat makes no sense to me as nonRep should never be used like that afaik.p  pSo, what can I do to fix this, how can I make Java SSL pick only certs with sane key usagep  pBtw, JDK1.7021 on Windows.

It seems to be closure problem where things are going wrong but not sure.Since I am new to this kind of serialization I dont know where to start digging.p  pstrongHere is the code I am testing strongp  precodepackage org.apache.spark.examples   import java.io.FileWriter import java.io.IOException import java.io.PrintWriter import java.net.InetAddress import java.net.UnknownHostException  import org.apache.spark.SparkConf import org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaRDD import org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaSparkContext import org.apache.spark.api.java.function.Function        Spark application to test the Serialization issue in spark   public class Test       static PrintWriter outputFileWriter     static FileWriter file     static JavaSparkContext ssc      public static void mainString[] args            String inputFile  homeincubatorsparkexamplessrcmainscalaorgapachesparkexamplesInputFile.txt          String master  local         String jobName  TestSerialization         String sparkHome  hometestSparkInstallationspark0.7.0         String sparkJar  hometestTestSerializationIssesInSparkTestSparkSerIssueApptargetTestSparkSerIssueApp0.0.1SNAPSHOT.jar           SparkConf conf  new SparkConf         conf.setspark.closure.serializer,org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer         conf.setspark.kryo.registrator, org.apache.spark.examples.MyRegistrator          create the Spark context         ifmaster.equalslocal             ssc  new JavaSparkContextlocal, jobName,conf             ssc  new JavaSparkContextlocal, jobName          else              ssc  new JavaSparkContextmaster, jobName, sparkHome, sparkJar                  JavaRDDltStringgt testData  ssc.textFileinputFile.cache         final NotSerializableJavaClass notSerializableTestObject new NotSerializableJavaClassHi          SuppressWarnings serial, unchecked         JavaRDDltStringgt classificationResults  testData.map                 new FunctionltString, Stringgt                      Override                     public String callString inputRecord throws Exception                                             ifinputRecord.isEmpty                              String[] pointDimensions  inputRecord.split,                             String result                                try                                  FileWriter file  new FileWriterhometestTestSerializationIssesInSparkresultstestresult  int Math.random  100                                 PrintWriter outputFile  new PrintWriterfile                                  InetAddress ip                                 ip  InetAddress.getLocalHost                                 outputFile.printlnIP of the server   ip                                  result  notSerializableTestObject.testMethodinputRecord                                 outputFile.printlnResult   result                                  outputFile.flush                                 outputFile.close                                 file.close                               catch UnknownHostException e                                  e.printStackTrace                                                          catch IOException e1                                  e1.printStackTrace                                                            return result                          else                              System.out.printlnEnd of elements in the stream.

Negative 1605 pIm working on a site which is try to be super secure. I read a lot about password hashing and using salts, but not everything is clear to me. I would like to use sha256 hash algorithm with salt. I know about salts that all of them should be unique peruser perpassword.p  pIm wondering what if I use the password as salt too Hash the password with sha256 and then hash it with an other algorithm and use it as salt. In this way I dont have to store the salt in the database. Is this possible or should I generate a random stringp

Negative 1605 pbHow can I mount a tar.gz archive transparently with Pythonbp  pI have a tar.gz archive whose contents have to be read by an external program. The contents will only be needed temporarily. I could just unpack it to a temporary folder and point my external program there to read it. Afterwards, I could just delete the temp folder again. However, the archives may be large 1 GB when extracted so that unpacking them will take up a lot of space on the disk. My server is rather weak regarding HD performance and I cannot waste space ad lib but it does have a lot of RAM and CPU power.p  pThats why I want to try to mount the archive transparently without unpacking it entirely. I came across a hrefhttplinuxaria.comhowtohowtomountsanarchiveforaccessasafilesystem relnofollowarchivemounta which seems to do exactly what I want. bIs there a way to do what archivemount does in pure Pythonb No subprocess.call solutions, please. It should run on 64bit Linux.p  pI believe there should be a smart way to use a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2librarytarfile.html relnofollowtarfilea to access archives contents   and then a hrefhttpsgithub.comterencehonlesfusepy relnofollowfusepya to create a userspace file system which exposes the contents of the archive. Has anyone already put these pieces together Any ideasp  pIf you think that this is not a good idea, please post relevant comments. If you know what is better, please comment.p

Negative 1605 pI am using glsl as a framework for GPGPU for realtime imageprocessing. I am currently trying to shave off a few more milliseconds to make my application realtime. Heres the basic setupp  pI take an input image, calculate several transformations of it, and then output a result image. For instance, Let the input image be codeIcode. Then the one fragment shader calculates codefIcode the second calculates codegIcode and the last one calculates codehfI,gIcode. p  pMy question is regarding efficiently calculating codefI,gIcode does it matter if I use 2 separate fragment shaders and therefore 2 rendering passes, or if I use a single fragment shader with 2 outputs Will the latter run faster I have mostly found discussions about the howto not about the performance. p  h2Edith2  pThanks for the replies so far. Following several remarks, heres an example for my usecase with some more detailsp  pI want a to filter the rows of image codeIcode with a 1d filter and also filter the rows of the squared image each pixel is squared.  codefI  filter rowscode and codegI  square and filter rowscodep  pcodeshader1 input image I gt filter rows gt Irows output imagecodep  pcodeshader2 input image I gt square pixels and filter rowsgt I2rows output imagecodep  pThe question is strongwill writing a single shader that does both operations be faster than running these two shaders one after the otherstrong derhass suggests that the answer is positive, because of accessing the same texture locations and enjoying locality. But if it wasnt for the texturelocality would I still be enjoying a performance boost or is a single shader rendering to two outputs basically equivalent to two render passesp

Negative 1605 pI need to implement a backup solution for virtual machines runnin on Windows Server 2008 R2 using Powershell and PSHyperV module. The module helps loads, as it provides an easy way to get VM properties and other stuff, perform basic functions, etc. p  pI plan for the least downtime scenario, as the VMs in question are potentially used by clients, and they usually dont tolerate any downtime. I am aware that using Windows Server 2012 R2 hypervisor solves this problem altogether because it has live VHD merge functionality, but migration of infrastructure is a long enough process and backups dont wait. p  pCurrently, the backups are done via codesave VM gt copy tree gt start VMcode process, which involves up to 6h downtime for the biggest VM. I am planning to use VM snapshots to lessen the downtime, as once you have performed a snapshot, you can back up the VHDs and the snapshot data elsewhere without disturbing the VM itll be slower, but thats all. Then I plan to save the VM, remove the snapshot VHD merge will occur, wait until merging will complete, then start the VM, potentially reducing the VM downtime to half an hour worst case.p  pSo far my script is able to locate VHDs of a given VM, back them up, but is unable to find the VMs snapshots location. It is possible that just traversing the tree from VHDs folder backwards will not yield me neither Virtual Machines nor Snapshots folder, so guessing is out of option. p  pHow do I get the location of snapshot files in order to do a manual export for the VM snapshotp

Negative 1605 pI asked a similar, unanswered question only a X11specific comment months ago specifically pertaining to the Alt key I have since refactored my requirements.p  pId like to be able to see if the Alt key or if mouse buttons 8 or 9 are held at the time of an event in GDK, typically codeGdkEventButtoncode, codeGdkEventMotioncode, and codeGdkEventKeycode, in the same fashion as the GdkModifierType state field in the various events.p  pHowever, the Alt key isnt automatically exported by GDK, as the Super, Hyper, and Meta keys are. Instead, the documentation merely states that MOD1 is typically the Alt key and that only mouse buttons 15 are explicitly supported. pbor suggested on IRC that all programs merely assume MOD1 is Alt, but Id rather not make those kinds of assumptions, and that still doesnt help with the mouse buttons.p  pSo my question is is there a way I can detect these keys and buttons being pressed at the time of an event For instancep  ul liis there a way I can hand GDK a keysym and get out a GdkModifierType back I see that there are ways to do the other way around and that require a hardware keycode...li liis there an equivalent to the Windows API codeGetKeyStatecode function, which specifically returns the key state at the time of the message being processed, regardless of what is being held at the time of the callli ul  pNo code sample this time, sorry. Thanks.p

Negative 1605 pI am developing a jsp web app that was not intended to be multilanguage, but now they wanted it to be able to change the user interface language depending on browser locale.p  pSo, to implement i18n for labels and other fixed elements is easy enough, but there is a dashboard framework we did that have some standard reports which titles, column headers and other elements are fixed too, but retrieved from DB, and not all of them will be translated.p  pI was thinking of solving this problem using some notation to indicate which field value is a translatable element. By example, maybe using some coderesource.bundle.key.elementcode notation.p  pWell, the dashboards entities uses JPA. So, I want to know if is it possible to do the i18n translation using resource bundles and do the locale translation after retrieving values from DB without do an intrusive coding, maybe using annotations or AOP implementations.p  pIs such thing possible or there is another approach I could usep
Negative 1605 pFirst the imaginary use case. Lets say I have a stream of tuples codeuserid, timestamp, loginipcode. I want to maintain the last login IP of each user at 5 seconds granularity. p  pUsing Spark streaming, I can use the codeupdateStateByKeycode method to update this map. The problem is, as the stream of data keeps coming, the RDD of each time interval is becoming larger and larger because more codeuseridscode are seen.  After sometime, the map will become so large that maintaining it takes longer time, thus the realtime delivery of the result can not be achieved. p  pNote that this is just a simple example that I come up with to show the problem.

Negative 1605 pI dont know whether the problem is sourced this far back, so I will tell you about it anyway. I have a function stored as Parse Cloud Code which retrieves the users list of scheduled emails, as per Parse and Mandrill API documentation. However, the returned object from Mandrill, according to their docs, is an array of structs containing String keyvalue pairs. You can see the relevant docs here a hrefhttpsmandrillapp.comapidocsmessages.JSON.htmlmethodlistscheduled relnofollowhttpsmandrillapp.comapidocsmessages.JSON.htmlmethodlistscheduledap  pParse Cloud Code can only be in Javascript, so how the returned array is interpreted by it, I am not sure. Either way, I have the cloud function return the returned array directly back to the Java method which called it in my Android application. I thought it would arrive as a JSONArray, but that did not seem to be the case. My editor, Android Studio, insisted that the return type was of codeArrayListltScheduledEmailgtcode, and would not let me use any other parameter type, so I set it to that. ScheduledEmail is the class I created in Java to match the elements contained in a returned struct from Mandrill, for this method. Was this part of where I went wrong How do I convert those structs in the returned array into Javacompatible keyvalue pairs However, when I try to access an object contained in the array, I receive this errorp  precode    java.lang.ClassCastException java.util.HashMap cannot be cast to com...ScheduledEmail codepre  pNowhere does there seem to have been a HashMap used.

Negative 1605 pGood evening,p  pyour page already helped a lot but I discovered problems when trying to format an NFCtag and I couldnt find a topic related to NDEFformat a tag.p  pFirst I have to say that Im new to the NFC technology.p  pI bought the following tag a hrefhttpwww.ti.comproductRII16112A03description relnofollowhttpwww.ti.comproductRII16112A03descriptionap  pThis chip is factory tested and therefore every byte has been written to 0x00.p  pAnd now the problems start I downloaded the application note to the tag  a hrefhttpwww.ti.comlitansloa166asloa166a.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.ti.comlitansloa166asloa166a.pdfa and created an android appsource code below to write the memory as shown in figure12. When I read out the content of the tag with the NXPTagInfo app the memory looks as it should. The problem is still that it shows in the NXPTagInfo that there is No NFC data set storage and furthermore it is discovered as NFCTECH. Tell me if Im wrong but this shows that the tag is definitely not NDEFformatted.p  pFor writing to the tag I did some research because its not documented in the application notedatasheet and this is what confuses me most. Are there any documents that specify which byte flags can be used or which exist I used 0x42 because Ive seen it in this forum  if you want the source please ask for it.p  pMy hardware Sony Xperia S

It will perform all initialization of hardware before entering an infinite loop from where my main application logic will reside. p  pMy main question is is there any way interrupts can be used to perform asynchronous behaviorthinking thread like functionality to check certain characteristics of the hardware and on any hardware subsystem error, cause a reset, log the occurrence, etc. I guess I am trying to implement something like a watchdog but I want it to behave completely asynchronously and without requiring any intervention by the main applicationlike kicking the watchdog.

Negative 1605 pI often use AJAX to write into MYSQL database like sop  precode.ajax      url writescript.php,     type POST,     data  data  mydata,this could be anything      ,     success function html        do something     codepre  pAnd the codewritescript.phpcode looks like thisp  precodedataPOST[data] and then write into database. codepre  pNow this works and everything but then anybody can view the ajax request since its pure JS and can be viewed from the page source.

Negative 1605 pI am currently working on a project using neo4j as database and queries that involve some hard relationship discover, and after running performance testing we are having some issues. p  pWe have found out that cache is influencing the time of the requests insanely from 3000ms to 100ms or so. Doing the same request twice would result in one really slow, and the second one much faster. After some searches we saw the warmup method, that is going to preload all the nodes and relationships in the database querying something like thisp  precodematch n[r]gt return count1 codepre  pHaving cache activated plus this warmup query we had a big decrease of the time of our queries, but still not as fast as if you queried two, three or four times the same query.p  pSo we went on testing and searching info until that we saw that Neo4j is also somehow buffering the queries in order to not be compiled every time using Scala compiler, if I am right. I say somehow, because after intense testing I could conclude that Neo4j is compiling the query on the fly. p  pLet me show a simplified example of what I meanp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXV7UL.png altstructureexamplep  pnumbers are emidem attributesp  pIf I make a request like the followingp  precodematch ngreen id 1[r]gtred[s]gtgreenlt[t]myellow id 7  return countm codepre  pWhat I want to do is to find if there is a connection between the node 1 and the node. As you can see, I have to discover a bunch of nodes and more important, relationships, and the compile process looks more or less complicated since the request took 1227 ms to complete. If I make exactly the same request again, I get a response time of about 5 ms, good enough to pass the performance testing. Definitely Neo4j or the Scala compiler was buffering the cypher queries too.p  pAfter understanding that there is a compile process in the cypher request, I went deeper and started modifying only parts of an already buffered request. Changing the label or id parameter of the last node matched was also producing a delay, but only 19 ms, still acceptablep  precodematch ngreen id 1[r]gtred[s]gtgreenlt[t]mpurple id 7  return countm codepre  pHowever, when I restart the server, do warmup and adjust the query so that the first node labelled before as n doesnt match, the query will respond very fast with 0 results so I can deduce that not all the query was parsed, since the first node didnt match and there is no need to go deeper in the tree.p  pI also tried with optional match, providing that returns null if no match was found, but it isnt working either.p  pI wanted to ask first of all if so far everything that I said based in my tests is correct and in case that it is not, how its actually working  And secondly, what should I do if there is a way to cache everything at the beginning, when the server started. Unfortunately, the requirements of the project say that queries should perform well, even the first one and not to say that the real scenario has thousands more relationships and nodes, making everything slower, or if there is no way to avoid this delay. p

Negative 1605 pThis is my first question here, so please bear with me p  pI am trying to implement a framework for assessing the data quality of a system by using bean validation. My system uses JBoss 7.1.1 and Hibernate 5.1.3. As a first step, I wanted to output some simple validation statistics, such as the percentage of violations per constraint type. To do that, I wanted to first get all the constraint annotations that I have declared in each entity currently I only have classlevel and field constraints. I thought I had found a way to do this by casting my ConstraintDescriptors to ConstraintDescriptorImpl and then calling the getAnnotationType method on that theres probably a more elegant way to do what I want, but this probably belongs to a different question. This all compiles fine, but at runtime I get the following exceptionp  precodejava.lang.ClassCastException org.hibernate.validator.metadata.ConstraintDescriptorImpl cannot be cast to org.hibernate.validator.internal.metadata.descriptor.ConstraintDescriptorImpl codepre  pWhat is going on here The location of ConstraintDescriptorImpl in the hibernatevalidator5.1.3 JAR is org.hibernate.validator.internal.metadata.descriptor.ConstraintDescriptorImpl, which I am using in my import. After some googling, I found that org.hibernate.validator.metadata.ConstraintDescriptorImpl was the location of the class in hibernatevalidator4.x. In fact, I tried adding the hibernatevalidator4.1.0 JAR on my path, and the whole thing works smoothly. But this doesnt seem to answer my question and I want to use the 5.1.3 version.p  pSince I dont use hibernatevalidator4.x anywhere else in the project, I suspect that maybe JBoss including hibernatevalidator4.2 in its modules could be to blame. But then again it might be a Hibernate validator issue. In any case, I have no idea how to solve or even debug the issueany help would be greatly appreciated p  pThanks p

Negative 1605 pI have a create form that I am working on. Two of the fields are OriginAirportID and DestinationAirportID. p  pWhat currently can be done is someone types in a string of letters in this field, the page then creates an AJAX request using this string to get a set of data back in JSON.

Negative 1605 pI have custom serverclient applications that communicate to each other using an SSLencrypted TCP connection custom protocol.

Negative 1605 pI am creating a simple application using C and WPF using the MVVM pattern. There is a main window with a few buttons and a ContentControl containing a list of view models, one of them being SearchViewModel. The buttons flip between the view models.p  pThe SearchViewModel is bound to the SearchView and contains a TabControl. The ItemsSource property is bound to a list of SearchTabViewModels. In the constructor of SearchViewModel, I am initializing the ObservableCollection of SearchTabViewModels and then adding two tabs. The first tab has  for its header and the other is a normal search tab. The TabControls SelectionChanged event is bound to a method that checks if the  tab was clicked. If it is, a new tab is inserted before the  tab and the TabControls SelectedIndex property is set to the index of the inserted tab. Fairly simple setup.p  pThe issue Im having is that when the application is first run, you can click the  tab and insert a new tab but then the  tab is dead and nothing happens when you click it. The SelectionChanged event does not fire. Ive checked and the SelectedIndex is set to the tab before it so its not the selected tab. To fix it, you have to click on another tab first and then everything works fine. It just freezes that once at the beginning.p  pCan anybody see what the issue may be Im including the relevant portions of codep  pXAMLp  precodeltTabControl      NamesearchTabControl ItemsSourceBinding PathSearchTabs     SelectedIndexBinding PathSelectedTabIndex     ItemTemplateSelectorBinding SourceStaticResource searchTabTemplateSelectorgt      ltiInteraction.Triggersgt         ltiEventTrigger EventNameSelectionChanged gt             ltiInvokeCommandAction                  CommandNamesearchTabHasChanged CommandBinding SelectionChangedCommand                 CommandParameterBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource Self, PathCommandNamegt         ltiEventTriggergt     ltiInteraction.Triggersgt     ....more code codepre  pSearchViewModelp  precodepublic class SearchViewModel  ObservableObject, IPageViewModel      region Fields      public ObservableCollectionltSearchTabViewModelgt SearchTabs  get set      private int selectedTabIndex     private ICommand selectionChangedCommand      endregion      public SearchViewModel              try                       initialize the SearchTabs array             this.SearchTabs  new ObservableCollectionltSearchTabViewModelgt               add a tabItem with  in header              SearchTabViewModel tabAdd  new SearchTabViewModel              this.SearchTabs.AddtabAdd               add first tab             AddTabItem              SelectedTabIndex  0                  catch Exception ex                      MessageBox.Showex.Message                    region PropertiesCommands      public int SelectedTabIndex              get  return selectedTabIndex          set                      selectedTabIndex  value             OnPropertyChangedSelectedTabIndex                    public ICommand SelectionChangedCommand              get                      if selectionChangedCommand  null                              selectionChangedCommand  new RelayCommand                     param gt TabSelectionChangedparam                                           return selectionChangedCommand                    endregion      region Methods      public void TabSelectionChangedObject source              if source.ToString  searchTabHasChanged                      SearchTabViewModel tab  this.SearchTabs[SelectedTabIndex]              if tab  null ampamp tab.Header  null                              if tab.Header.Equals                                       add new tab                     SearchTabViewModel addedTab  AddTabItem                       select newly added tab item                     SelectedTabIndex  this.SearchTabs.IndexOfaddedTab                                                  private SearchTabViewModel AddTabItem              int count  SearchTabs.Count           create new tab item         SearchTabViewModel tab  new SearchTabViewModel         tab.Header  string.FormatTab 0, count           insert tab item right before the last  tab item         this.SearchTabs.Insertcount  1, tab          return tab           endregion  codepre  pAlso, another curious behavior Ive noticed is that when you first run the application and click the  tab once to add a new tab and the  tab dies, if the application loses focus and gains focus again, the SelectionChanged event fires and a new tab is added This behavior only happens when the  tab is dead. Once you fix it by clicking on another tab, this behavior disappears.p

Negative 1605 pWe are currently discussing how to define our goals on code coverage in a C project this question is not limited to C though. On the way, we found that we should exclude some code from being counted. The most obvious are the tests themselves, as they have 100 coverage and should not influence the average. But there are also classes that are wrappers for system calls we need to be able to create mocks. They are untestable, as we dont want to test system libraries. The code is calculated towards the coverage though and makes it hard to move across the 90 mark.p  pWe do not want to lie at ourselves by excluding every piece of code that is untested, which makes it fairly easy to walk towards 100.p  pThe question is Is there any reference, article or discussion on this topic with experience in this area We would like to explore the different views on this topic that may help us finding and developing our definition for testable code.p
Negative 1605 pI have recently analyzed an old piece of code compiled with VS2005 because of a different numerical behaviour in debug no optimizations and release O2 Oi Ot options compilations. The reduced code looks likep  precodevoid fdouble x1, double y1, double x2, double y2  double a1, a2, d  a1  atan2y1,x1 a2  atan2y2,x2 d  a1  a2 if d  0.0   NOTE I know that  on reals is evil    printfEQUALn  codepre  pThe function codefcode is expected to print EQUAL if invoked with identical pairs of values e.g. codef1,2,1,2code, but this doesnt always happen in release. Indeed it happened that the compiler has optimized the code as  if it were something like coded  a1atan2y2,x2code and removed completely the assignment to the intermediate variable codea2code. Moreover, it has taken advantage of the fact that the second codeatan2codes result is already on the FPU stack, so reloaded codea1code on FPU and subtracted the values. The problem is that the FPU works at extended precision 80 bits while codea1code was only double 64 bits, so saving the first codeatan2codes result in memory has actually lost precision. Eventually, codedcode contains the conversion error between extended and double precision.p  pI know perfectly that identity codecode operator with floatdouble should be avoided. My question is not about how to check proximity between doubles. My question is about how contractual an assignment to a local variable should be considered. By my naive point of view, an assignment should force the compiler to convert a value to the precision represented by the variables type double, in my case. What if the variables were float What if they were int weird, but legalp  pSo, in short, what does the C standard say about that casesp

Negative 1605 pI have a form which contains 4 accordions.Each accordion will have some input elements and a next button.p  pI will make an ajax call on change of each input element to validate it and when clicking the next button i ll check whether all the input elements are validated and show the next accordion.p  pSo when someone changes an input field and click next button both onchange of input element and click of next button element get triggered but click event die sometimes without being executed due to the ajax call in onchange event take few swconds.p  pSo in this particular scenario i want click event of next button to get triggered after the completion of onchange event of input field.p  pplease suggest a way to do this. p

Negative 1605 pI am working for on a project its target is to make it possible for my companies software to be plugin compatible. The main target is to make the footprint of our software a lot smaller.p  pWe achieved the software part by splitting the program in different elementary Cores and Plugins. The Cores define the Side Client  Server  Remote CheckInOut Location  Management  Processing. The plugins define the behaviour  of the software. Do you just want Personal Management Fine than just take the Persons and Workplace Plugins Do you want to manage who enters the building than add the RemoteIO and Keys Plugins to the list. And so forth. For up to in total 40 different plugins. Most of them can be used in any combination a buyer likes There are some dependencies but there are not much.p  pSo for small firms the software can be really lightweight. But the DB is still HUGE with nearly 400 Tables it has to manage, most of them are not even used when only the smallest version is sold. To make that smaller we are looking for ways on how to make the DB Pluginable, so that only the tables, columns, keys, indexes, foreign keys etc. that are needed by at least one of the active plugins are there on the Server side. On top of that we have to make sure that we can update the DB easily if we ever wanted to change it.p  pstrongSo my question is Does any of you have experience with making a DB Pluginable When yes How did you solve the issue And what tools should i take a look at Or should i write them myselfstrongp  pThe Framework for the system is Windows, Windows Server 2003 or higher, SQL Server either MSSQL or InformixDB2, Entity Framework 6.1 for MSSQL 5 for InformixDB2, .Net Framework 3 or Higher If available, WPF, WCF.p  pGreets,p  pMarcp
Negative 1605 pId like to preface this with what will become obvious in that I am extremely new to programming and have much to learn. So Im having a problem where my nested if else statements are being ignored. The second and third printf statements are integers but are converted into decimals, since they are the percent discount being applied to the price for medium and large orders. Im using a while loop to test 3 conditions and if they are all met the message is printed, however if they are not met, I have made 3 if and if else statements to test for which condition is not being met. However , I have missed something as they are not being accurately printed.The base widget cost should not be higher than the base price, med price, or the large price, as this will make the widget sold at a loss.

Negative 1605 pIve been wanting to give FRP a shot for a while now, and yesterday I finally bit the bullet and had a go, using Netwire 5 to begin with a fairly arbitrary choice in itself, but I have to start somewhere.  Ive managed to get to the point of code which works but Ive noticed a couple of patterns which Im not sure are part of how the library is expected to be used or whether they are a symptom that Im doing something wrong somewhere.p  pI started with a hrefhttptodayincode.tumblr.compost96914679355almostanetwire5tutorialthis tutoriala, which was enough to get me up and running pretty easily  I now have a spinning cube controlled by a simple incrementing number wirep  precodespin  HasTime t s, Monad m gt Wire s e m a GL.GLfloat spin  integral 0 . 5 codepre  pand the application will quit when Esc is pressed, making use of the wires supplied in a hrefhttpshackage.haskell.orgpackagenetwireinputglfwnetwireinputglfwap  precodeshouldQuit  Monoid e, Functor m, Monad m gt Wire s e GLFWInputT m a a shouldQuit  keyPressed GLFW.KeyEscape codepre  pAn important distinction between these is that codespincode never inhibits  it should always return some value  while codeshouldQuitcode inhibits all the time until the key is actually pressed in which case I quit the application.p  pThe thing that makes me uneasy is the way I end up having to use these wires.  Right now, it looks something like thisp  precodewt, spinWire lt stepWire spinWire st  Right undefined qt, quitWire, inp lt runStateT stepWire quitWire st  Right undefined inp  case qt, wt of   Right ,  gt return    , Left   gt return      , Right x gt do things, render, recurse into next frame codepre  pThere are two things about this pattern that make me feel uncomfortable.  First, the fact that I pass codeRight undefinedcode to both calls to codestepWirecode.  I think if my understanding is correct that this parameter is for sending events to a wire, and that since my wires dont make any use of events this is safe, but it feels bad strongEDITstrong maybe events is the wrong word here  the tutorial describes it as for blocking values, but the point still stands  I never intend to block and dont make use of the codeecode parameter anywhere in my wire.  I looked to see if there was a version of codestepWirecode for the situation where you know you never have an event and you wouldnt respond to it even if you did have one, but couldnt see one.  I tried making the wires codeecode parameter codecode and then passing codeRight code everywhere, which feels marginally less dirty than codeundefinedcode, but still doesnt quite seem to represent my intent.p  pSimilarly, the return value is also an codeEithercode.  Thats perfect for the codeshouldQuitcode wire, but notice I have to pattern match on codewtcode, the output of the codespincode wire.  I really dont know what it would mean for that to inhibit, so I just codereturn code, but I can imagine this getting unwieldy as the number of wires increases, and again, it just doesnt seem that representative of my intent  to have a wire which never inhibits and which I can rely upon always to hold the next value.p  pSo although I have code which works, Im left with the uneasy feeling that Im doing it wrong somehow, and since Netwire 5 is fairly new its difficult to find examples of idiomatic code that I can check against and see if Im near the mark.  Is this how the library is intended to be used or am I missing somethingp  pstrongEDITstrong Ive managed to resolve the second problem I mention pattern matching on the codeEithercode result of codespincode by combining codespincode and codeshouldQuitcode into a single codeWirecodep  precodeshouldContinuePlaying  Monoid e, Functor m, Monad m gt Wire s e GLFWInputT m a a shouldContinuePlaying  keyNotPressed GLFW.KeyEscape  game  HasTime t s, Monoid e, Functor m, Monad m gt Wire s e GLFWInputT m a GL.GLfloat game  spin . shouldContinuePlaying codepre  pStepping this wire gives me a much more sensible return value  if its codeLeftcode I can quit, otherwise I have the piece of data to work with.  It also hints at a greater degree of composability than my original method.p  pI still have to pass codeRight undefinedcode as the input to this new wire though.  Admittedly, theres only one of them now, but Im still not sure if this is the right approach.p

Negative 1605 pI have a main fragment Fragment A that is my apps home screen. I have a list of Fragments Fragment B, Fragment C that replace Fragment A when selected from a drawer. I want to keep the backstack at 1, so that no matter how many times the user navigates between B amp C, the back button always takes them back to A. My Code so far works the first time the app is launched and Fragments BC are visited.p  pHowever, after the user backs to Fragment A for the first time, any subsequent replacements leak Fragment A in the background that is, Fragment BC is overlapped ontop of Fragment A instead of fully replacing it.

Negative 1605 pI am working with the latest version of Xamarin Android in Visual Studio 2013. When I debug my code, the catch blocks are not catching any thrown exceptions.

ISharedPreferences sharedPrefs  context.GetSharedPreferencesshared.prefs.file, FileCreationMode.Private       This line also works as expected. GetString returns the default null      because the sharePrefs file was just created and is empty.     string versions  sharedPrefs.GetStringVersions, null       This line throws a System.ArgumentNullException because versions is null.      This is also to be expected.     storedVersions  JsonConvert.DeserializeObjectltVersionsgtversions       The problem is that catch does not catch the exception.

Negative 1605 pWhile trying to figure out how to recreate an ember app which I cant migrate to CLI, and use generate to create resources, and routes with paths and dynamic segments, I was creating and deleting a test app several times. At one point it seems that ember cli tried to update to 0.2.0 and I got warnings about npm packages wanting an older version of node, so I changed the versions in the package json files for those.

Negative 1605 pI am trying to understand its usage better in order to improve scrolling performance on OSX. More specifically, I am trying to eradicate the flashingflickering on the side of the screen as you scroll fast and AppKit runs into nonoverdrawn nonprepared portions of your view OR portions of your view that have been prepared incorrectly with backgroundonly.p  pMy understanding is that the preparedContentRect represents the overdrawn section of your scrollview  the area available for responsive scrolling.p  h1Part Oneh1  pI placed code within the codepreparedContentInRectcode for two subViews of codeNSScrollViewcode  each are floating subViews of codeNSScrollViewcode which behave the same as documentViews when scrolling.p  pThe codepreparedContentInRectcode gets called several times just after program launch as expected. I then scroll to the end of the prepared area BUT unexpectedly it doesnt get called again as I get nearer and nearer and even on the edge of the prepared area. Why not Even with no user interaction with the UI system idle it does not call codepreparedContentInRectcode to enlarge the overdraw area dynamically.p  h1Part Twoh1  pSince as above I could not rely on AppKit calling codepreparedContentInRectcode when needed I reorganised my code to prepare the codepreparedContentRectcode after each notification from the clipviews codeboundsChangeNotificationcode and then call codeprepareContentInRectcode manually to inform AppKit of the new overdraw area. p  pI have included a manual flag so that my custom override can differentiate between my manual calls to codeprepareContentInRectcode and internal calls from AppKit  so as not to let AppKit mess up the overdrawp  precodevar manuallyPrepareContentInRect  false override func prepareContentInRectrect NSRect      if manuallyPrepareContentInRect         printlnGRID manual prepareContentInRect call rect         manuallyPrepareContentInRect  false         super.prepareContentInRectrect         return          printlnGRID bypass AppKit prepareContentInRect call self.preparedContentRect     super.prepareContentInRectself.preparedContentRect  codepre  pUnfortunately, even though codeprepareContentRectcode is reporting my intended prepare rect, when it scrolls it does not seem to have prepared the rect as I have intended  it prepares a rect 3,500 points wide instead of 5,040 wide and hence I run into the dreaded background color while waiting for the rest of the view to render.p  pThe only special thing about the view that isnt getting correct overdraw is that it has a whole lot of subviews that have been drawn into its layer using codecanDrawSubviewsIntoLayercode.p  pWhat am I misunderstanding above with respect to codeprepareContentInRectcode and overdraw Why is AppKit behaving like it is p

When I navigate within the table with the updown arrow keys, it doesnt send the action.p  pIve verified that Column Select is disabled this is the equivalent of the old Full Row Select option, right and have tried setting the NSTableView to Continuous... no luck.p  pHelp pls Thanks...p

Negative 1605 pI am a biologist working in aquaculture nutrition research and until recently I havent paid much attention to the power of statistics. The usual method of analysis had been to run ANOVA on final weights of animals given various treatments and boom, you have a result. I have tried to improve my results by designing an experiment that could track individuals growth over time but I am having a really hard time trying to understand which model to use for the data I have. p  pFor simplified explanation of my experiment I have 900 abalonesnails which were sourced from a single cohort spawnedborn at the same time. I have individually marked each abalone id and recorded a length and weight at Time 0. The animals were then randomly assigned 1 of 6 treatment diets n30 abalone per treatment each replicated n5 times n150 abalone  replicate. Each replicate looks like a randomized block design where each treatment is only replicate once within each block and each is assigned to independent tank with n30 abalonetank n treatment. Abalone were fed a known amount of feed for 90 days before being weighed and measured again Time 1. They are back in their homes for another 90 days before the concluding the experiment.p  pFrom my understanding  fixed effects   Time, Treatment  nested random efffects  replicate, idp  pMy raw data entered is in Long format with each row being a unique animal and coloumns for Time 0 or 1, Replicate 15, Treatment 16, Sex M or F Animal ID 1900, Length mm, Weight g, Condition Factor WeightLenght2.995655p  pI have used columns from my raw data and converted them to factors and vectors before using the new variables to create a data frame.p  precodeidltas.factordata.long[,5]  timeltas.factordata.long[,1]  replicateltas.factordata.long[,2]  treatmentltdata.long[,3]  weightltas.vectordata.long[,7]  lengthltas.vectordata.long[,6]  cfltas.vectordata.long[,10] codepre  pMy data frame is currently in the following structure df1ltdata.frametime,replicate,treatment,id,weight,length,cfp  pI am struggling to understand how to nest my individual abalone within replicates. I can convert the weight data to change from initial but I think the package nlme already accounts this change when coded correctly. I could also create another measure of Specific Growth Rate for each animal at Time 1 but this would not allow the Time factor to be used.p  precodelmeweight  timetreatment, random1  id, methodML, datadf1 codepre  pI would like to structure a mixed effects model so that my code takes into account the individual animal variability to detect statistical differences in their weight at Time 1 between treatments.p  pIf anybody has suggestions about the experimental design I would like to hear them to, as it is often the case that a biologists experiment may not meet the requirements of a statistician, but we try anyway. A lot of work went into labeling each animal and I hope that this kind of resolution can avoid the need of averaging at the experimental unit level of tank. p  pPS, Aquaculture experiments need statisticians help and the world needs to be fed. p  pLive, Learn, Createp  pThanks in advance Cheersp

Negative 1605 pOur company creates custom devices that are used for storing and displaying special media files. These devices are internally based on Ubuntu OS. Each device has a unique id. We generate this id using some hardware parameters on the device.p  pA potential customer is asking for a FIPS140 based hardware dongle to be used as the device identifier. If the dongle is removed or replaced, our software should immediately stop working.p  pAt Amazon, it seems some USB drives are available that internally use FIPS140. I guess we could use them as our hardware dongle. However, I have not been able to figure out how to accomplish this. Does a FIPS140 based drive already has a device id that I can programmtically obtain Or, should I generate a device id value and write to the USB drive How would one readwrite to a FIPS140 based USB drive Regards.p

Negative 1605 pI am trying to create an iOS app, which will transfer the files from an iPhone to a server, process them there, and return the result to the app instantly. p  pI have noticed that AWS offers an SDK to transfer files from iOS app to S3, but not to EC2 or at least to EBS which can be attached to EC2. I wonder why I have to go through S3, when my business logic doesnt warrant storage of files. I have used file system softwares such as s3cmd and s3fs to connect to S3 from EC2, but they are very slow at transferring files to EC2. I am concerned that the route through S3 will kill time, especially when the users expect result in a split second. p  pCould you please guide me on how can I bypass the S3 route to transfer files in real time from iOS app to EC2 or EBSp

Negative 1605 pIam having some problems with the ProgressDialog in android. I thought it would be relatively easy to use but it turns out otherwise LOL. basically i have an Instance of progreesdialog in my activity RegistrationActivity. I press a button and registration commences by showing a progressdialog when this button is pressed. this is all done on the UI thread.  below is my code which calls my presenter method which in turn calls a method in my mode, as Iam using MVP.p  precodeOverride public void registerUser       progdialog  new ProgressDialogthis     progdialog.setMessageLoading...     progdialog.show      rpresenter.relayRegisterUseremailedtxt.getText.toString,             passedtxt.getText.toString, phoneedtxt.getText.toString   codepre  pI have a seperate thread set up in my model. In the model Iam currently faking the registration process by sleeping the thread for five seconds and using a handler to post a value back a value to the UI thread. below is the runnable i create and pass to my thread within the model RegisterModel.p  precode    private Runnable runnable  new Runnable      Override     public void run           upload data to the server                 reghandler.postnew Runnable                      Override                     public void run                          progress  50                         regpresenter.updateUIProgressprogress                         Log.dprog updated by , String.valueOfprogress                                                 try              Thread.sleep5000          catch InterruptedException e              e.printStackTrace                   reghandler.postnew Runnable                              Override                             public void run                                  progress  100                                 regpresenter.updateUIProgressprogress                                 Log.dprog update 2 , String.valueOfprogress                                                               appstate.setRegisteredtrue       codepre  pwhen i press the button I presumed the progressdialog would appear as it calls the registerUser method. But it does not. updateUIProgressprogress call my presenter. This in turn calls a method in my activityview called UpdateProgress. to which i post back the value of 100 after the thread in my model has slept for 5 seconds. this method is shown below.p  precodeOverride public void updateProgressint progress       Log.dincrement progactivity, String.valueOfprogress     progdialog.incrementProgressByprogress      ifprogress  100         hideProgress   codepre  pUpon recieving the progress value of 100 the hideProgress method is called which is shown below. but as the progressdialog isnt appearing in the first place it doesnt do anything.p  precodeprivate void hideProgress      Log.dhide prog called, hide prg called     progdialog.dismiss   codepre  peverything to do with the progressdialog is on the UI thread so Iam not too sure what Iam doing wrong here.

Negative 1605 pIs it possible in the WSO2 ESB to process a large file with each line representing a single recordmessage, and stop or pause the processing within the file, then restart where it left off using the Smooks mediator andor Iterate mediator, so any other mechanismp  pIt appears that if you are processing a large file say with 10K entries you cannot stop or pause the processing or say the ESB is brought down in the middle of processing the file, and then restart where it was stopped.

Negative 1605 pI have a master table like this  p  precodeTableFeature, PrjctNo, Instance codepre  pEach record here is unique. Say,p  precodeFTR1, PrjctA, Instance1 FTR1, PrjctB, Instance2 FTR2, PrjctA, Instance2 FTR2, PrjctB, Instance1 FTR3, PrjctA, Instance5 FTR4, PrjctA, Instance0 codepre  pBasically, each feature can be mapped to multiple projects. And each project can be mapped to multiple feature but the instance of that project for each feature will be unique.p  pWhat I have is a table with a subset of FTR Nos from the master table. Now, I want to retrieve all the projects from the master associated with these features. p  pNow, since each of these projects can be associated to multiple other features, I need to identify those records such that the Instance of the projects is always higher than the already existing one.p  pEx  Given that I have a subset FTR1, FTR2p  pIteration 1 p  precodeFTR1, PrjctA, Instance1 FTR1, PrjctB, Instance2 FTR2, PrjctA, Instance2 FTR2, PrjctB, Instance1 codepre  pIteration 2 Check if there any other features associated to any of the projects fetched above.

Im using an HTMLCSSJavascript combo and I started the project in Visual Studio 2015 as a new website.p  pI am able to test the site using all of my installed browsers and Windows Phone 8.1 the Windows 10 emulators open but wont debug for some reason.

Negative 1605 pI have an external keyvalue storage, which contains a set of binary values per key. These binary values are Scala objects serialized using Jackson 2.5 with a ScalaPlugin.p  pTo preserve set semantics in the storage, binary representation of an object should be stable, i.e. serializing it two times should result in the same sequence of bytes. Does Jackson have this guarantee If it uses JSON serialization as an intermediate step for example, there is no node ordering, so binary serialization will not be stable.p  pThis may get even more tricky if an object contains unordered structures internally like sets or maps.

Negative 1605 pIm getting a string like codeaaaaaacode from the server so I decode it and then I pass it to a function. p  pWhat I need to do with the message is something like loading paths depending the letters. p  pThe header of my function is codevoid SetInfoint num, char descr[4]code so it receives one number and an array of 4 chars sentences.

Initially, the info I was receiving on that function, was a stdwstring so all my code working with that message was with wstrings and strings but now what I receive is a char as shown in the header. The message arrived until here ok, but if I want to work with it, then I cant because if I debug and see each position of Descr[0] then I getp  precode descr[0][0]  a ok  descr[0][1]     BAD codepre  pso I tried converting char to wchar with a code found herep  precode sizet size  strlendescr[0]  1  wchart wa  new wchart[size]  mbstowcswa,descr[0],size codepre  pBut then the debugger shows me that codewacode has p  pcodewa wchart    0x185d4be8 Lauffffffff2e2e63656f736f4c6553736f6e6f6946736165692e6f00670219740b8020210rcodep  pwhich I suppose that is incorrect Im supossing that I have to see the same initial message of codeaaaaaacode. If this message is fine then I dont know how to get what I need...p  pSo my question is how can I get that descr[0][0]  a and descr[0][1]    I cant pass char to wchar youve already see what I got.
