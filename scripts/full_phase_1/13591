Positive 13591 pIm new to VBA, Im struggling with a piece of code, and Im hoping someone can help. I have a series of 78 tables, each with 1 column, in Sheet 1 of Workbook 1 ThisWorkbook, named Table A through Table BZ, respectively. Each table is the source for a corresponding named range, TableA through TableBZ that Im using to drive a series of dependent dropdowns on Sheet 2.p  pI have figured out the code to copy and paste values from Workbook 2 into each of the 78 tables in Workbook 1, one table at a time, effectively refreshing the available choices in the dependent dropdowns. If the number of values pasted from Workbook 2 is greater than the size of the table in Workbook 1, the table in Workbook 1 is automatically resized to fit the updated dataset. If the number of values pasted from Workbook 2 is less than the size of the table in Workbook 1, the table needs to be resized so that blank values dont show up in the dependent dropdowns.p  pI started by trying to include the resize the table within the copy  paste loop but couldnt seem to get the variables defined properly and struggled with choosing between the Range.Resize and ListObjects.Resize methods. Ive now tried to create a second loop to go through all the tables and resize one at a time after all the copying  pasting is done. Is there any difference in the two approachesp  pI can resize Table A with the following code, but it doesnt progress to Table B in the next loop i  2.p  precodeDim CurrentTable As ListObject i  1 Do     ThisWorkbook.Activate     Set CurrentTable  ActiveSheet.ListObjects1     CurrentTable.Resize RangeN1N10     i  i  1 Loop Until i  78 codepre  pI also need to resize each table to an appropriate number of rows, so I tried including another range variable.

Positive 13591 pI have worked on several projects now where I have been stumped by MS Excel and MS Access where I cannot use VBA to manipulate objects whilst in design view. They are very simple tasks such as changing the name of the labels on a userform in MS Excel or adding new textboxes to a report in MS Access but they seem to be impossible as any macro will only be used upon activation of said userform or report and so everything is just done in runtime.p  pTo focus on one, In MS Excel I want to be able to run a code which will go through all the labels on my userform and rename them from Label1, Label2, etc... to Lbl1, Lbl2, etc... for instance but I cannot just click a button to run a macro on the design of the userform which would run through all the labels and change their names. If I am able to do this then I can be much more efficent with the rest of my runtime code. Without it, I have the option of renaming every single label I have but there are near 100 labels and I want to do this through VBA as I already can see that it would be very useful to know how to run code in design view of these Visual Basic elements.p  pPlease could you advise whether it is possible to manipulate these VB objects in design viewp

Positive 13591 pI know that I can copy a column containing evaluated formulas, paste it into an adjacent column, and specify to paste values i.e., a text string, so that the value sticks and I can then select, copy, and edit the value text as I desire.

The format of the table is done  it is a simple affair, of one row  one individual record with many columns, however I am expecting over 200 records to have to be input into it, each being sourced from a separate Excel 2007 workbook containing a number of different worksheets.p  pMy only experience of coding was in QBASIC about 15 years ago and even then it was pretty much limited to if I remember correctly creating a Guess the number between 110 game  so Im in the wilderness a bit herep  pI would be looking for the code to extract data an x or textnumbers from a number of cells, in columns, and then put it into a new workbook, into rows.  There are empty locked cells within the columns which are used as spacers so that it is easier for the person filling it in to do so.  These should not appear in the summary workbook.p  pIs this possible  My alternative solution is to do it all by hand a task that as you can imagine I do not particularly fancy having to dop  pI have looked at other code on this site, but it doesnt seem to take into account the reformat changing from columns to rows, removing spaces amp entering each record in a new row.p

Negative 13591 pIn our project, a hrefhttpsharpwired.sourceforge.net relnofollowSharpWireda, were trying to create a download component similar to the download windows in Firefox or Safari. That is, one single top down list of downloads which are custom controls containing progress bars, buttons and what not.p  pThe requirements are that there should be one single list, with one element on each row. Each element must be a custom control. The whole list should be dynamically resizable, so that when you make it longer  shorter the list adds a scroll bar when needed and when you make it thinner  wider the custom controls should resize to the width of the list.p  pWeve tried using a codeFlowLayoutPanelcode but havent gotten resizing to work the way we want to.

Negative 13591 pI noticed aspmembership uses uniqueidentifier, and to me, it seemed like a waste of space, because I could not think of a particular reason to not replace it with identity. p  pHowever, SQL Server is not letting me change it to int. It says Conversion from uniqueidentifier to int is not supported on the connected database server.  After googling around, it seems like I would have to break all the relationships etc and then manually delete the column and readd it as int. Do you guys know of a better approach p  pI dont think I would be dealing with multiple databases, so uniqueidentifier seems unneeded for me.

Negative 13591 pIm possibly writing a plugin system for a Cocoa application Mac, not iPhone. p  pA common approach is the make each plugin a bundle, then inject the bundle into the main application. Im concerned with the security implications of doing this, as the bundle will have complete access to the ObjectiveC runtime. I am especially concerned with a plugin having access to the code that handles registration and serial keys.p  pAnother plugin system we are considering is based on distributed notifications. Basically, each plugin will be a separate process, and they will communicate via distributed notifications only.p  pIs there a way to load bundles securely e.g. sandboxing If not, do you see any problems with using distributed notifications Are there any other plugin architectures that would be betterp

Negative 13591 pFrom what I thought to understand is that implementing INotifyPropertyChanged within the ModelView, allows to raise the PropertyChanged event in case a property has been modified.p  pThat way the View should get to be notified that the underlying property has changed and hence the UI should fetch the new changes.p  pDid I get the theory rightp  pThe problem I face is that I have an Infragistics DataGrid bound to a ViewModel. As soon as I change a date Value, I can see how the property on the ViewModel is set correctly and the event is raised.  But I havent subscribed from outside to this event though, how does the UI get notifiedp  pI am asking this because I think the UI is not notofied at all.  I have placed a second textbox that is binding thourgh the ViewModel to the same underlying Model property. However if I modify that property with the DataGrid, the TextBox ModeOneWay is not automatically updated.p  pI actually make use of MVVMLight Frame work and use ViewModelBase instead of INotifyPropertyChanged  and do a RaisePropertyChanged.... But the result should be similar.p  pDo I have to subscribe the TextBox manually to that Event somehowp  pstrongEditstrong  I have solved the problem, but dont grasp exactly why this is happening. Before answering the Question I need to explain a bit more about the architecture.  The Datgrid is bound to propertyA in ViewModelA that returns an codeObservableCollectionltViewModelBgt.code  ViewModelB actually contains all the properties that the Grid should be displaying.  All these properties fire in their Setters naturally an OnProperyChanged. p  pThe TextBox was bound to PropertyB, that lives also within ViewModelA. But it returns directly a string, so the underlying getter of PerpertyB returns this p  precodecashflowInputs[0].ProjectedDate.ToString codepre  pHowever if I dont bind the TextBox to this propertyB, but bind it to PropertyA as well, it worksp  pp  pIts weird.

Negative 13591 pI am working on a small networking project using Winsock2. I am using a TCP connection and actually am working with IRC as an example since IRC is fairly simple. What I am doing is connecting to the server and sending an initial buffer so the server recognizes a connection. This works fine.p  pWhat concerns me is that I cannot write to the socket again. It seems my program hangs if I do not use shutdown on SDSEND after I send the initial buffer.p  pSo the next data based on RFC 1459 I want to send is the USER and NICK information, however, I feel like using shutdown is what is causing my current issue. Is there a way to reinitialize the write socketp  pThanksp  pstrongADDED CODEstrongp  pNote that these are located within a class so it still may be slightly obscured.

Negative 13591 pI need to pass a url string from the view to the controller, a url that is retrieved via jquery. I tried just using the id parameter in the default routing, but that didnt work. It didnt accept a url string.p  pCalling the Controller through jquery works fine, like thisp  precoderesult.loadHomeFiles  url codepre  pThis calls the correct action method, but unless I feed a simple text string it wont work I tested feeding the url variable a simple string just to make sure the method was called at all.p  pSo how can I get this url string to the controller I am trying to think about how to do this the MVC way, and not break that way of thinking, so I dont want to utilize a hidden input with runat server. Could it be done with ViewData I couldnt think of any way though, I only know how to set ViewData in the controller and fetch the value from the view, not the other way around...p  pI also tried adding a custom route before the default routep  precoderoutes.MapRoute     FileManager,  Route name     Homeactionurl,  URL with parameters     new  controller  Home, action  Files, url     Parameter defaults  codepre  pBut that didnt work either, same problem with not getting the url to the controller. I only did it because I had seen suggestions for it for people with similar problems here, but to be honest I dont see how this could work, because how is this any different from the default route I have no idea why the id parameter only seems to accept certain strings id format strings I suppose, but unless I could specify somehow what type the url parameter should be I dont see how adding this route should make any difference...p  pIf someone could enlighten me I would be very gratefulp  pEDIT When I think about it, since Im getting the content through an ajax call with jquery, Im not sure a ViewData type solution would work anyway, because the entire page isnt posted, or am I wrong Keep in mind that Im just learning MVC and jquery at the moment, so please dont assume I have all the basics clear to me yet . Basically I just want to be able to pass any type of string and possibly other types of data that is not an id to the controller from the view...p  pEDIT 2 I tried the suggested encodeURIComponent, but that didnt work either, unless Im doing something wrong.

Negative 13591 pI am learning node.js and most of examples I can find are dealing with simple examples. I am more interested in building realworld complicated systems and estimating how well event based model of node.js can handle all the use cases of a real application.p  pOne of the common patterns that I want to apply is let blocking execution to timeout if it does not occur within certain timeout time. For example if it takes more than 30 seconds to execute a database query, it might be too much for certain application. Or if it takes more than 10 seconds to read a file. p  pFor me the ideal program flow with timeouts would be similar to the program flow with exceptions. If an event does not occur within certain predefined timeout limit, then the event listener would be cleared from the event loop and a timeout event would be generated instead. This timeout event would have an alternate listener. If the event is handled normally, then both the timeout listener and event listener are cleared from the event loop.p  pIs there a general mechanism for timeout handling and cleaning up timed out processes I know some types such as socket have timeout parameter but it is not a general mechanism that applies to all events. p

Negative 13591 pIm writing an Android app for work that shows the status of our phone lines, but thats neither here nor there.p  pI make a call to one of our servers and get returned JSON text of the status.

Negative 13591 pI have a rather large CVS repository that I am looking to only convert a handful of modules into a single Subversion repository. I have been correctly guided to using a hrefhttpcvs2svn.tigris.org relnofollowcvs2svna for the conversion and have even gotten as far as building my own options file. I do not need to retain tags or branches, but I would like to retain the revision history. My issue is that I want my modules to be under a single trunk folder, e.g. svntrunkmodule1 and svntrunkmodule2 instead of svnmodule1trunk and svnmodule2trunk. When I set the path to nothing it throws an error about the path being blank. Any suggestionsp

Negative 13591 pSo,p  pI have a website that is served by 12 separate application servers without any shared cache. We use a third party webservice to implement a particular functionality in the app. However, the 3rd party doesnt want us to be calling them a lot lest it breaks their site.p  pHence I am thinking of keeping some kind of a proxy in between these 12 servers and the webservice so that all these go through this proxy. If the content they are requesting isnt found in the proxy, it goes over the wire, gets stuff from the 3rd party caches it and returns.p  pCan someone tell me what kind of proxy am I looking for Are there some easy to setup reliable opensource projects out there that can helpp  pthanksp

Negative 13591 pHey guys, I have a WPF TreeView that has three nodes, I would like the last child the third node to contain a ListView populated with my bound data.

This is expected behavior per the documentation, but Im looking for a work around possibly modify the ItemContainerStyle, unfortunately I have virtually no experience with the TreeViewItems control template, or for that matter much experience with TreeViews in general.p  pIve looked at the posibility of using a TreeListView but it doesnt fit my use case, nor does binding a separate control and displaying data that way.p  pHas anyone either already gone through the headache of sandwiching a ListView into a TreeViewItem, or can someone suggest how to modify the ControlTemplate to accomplish thisp  pThank you, Ajp

Negative 13591 pim wondering about the behaviour of the CALayer class and its reference counter. Please see the following two code snippetsp  pFirstp  precodeCALayer layer  [[CALayer alloc] init] NSLogretain count d,  [layer retainCount]  log retain count 1 [layer release]  no problem so far  [layer release]  this leads to a crash as expected codepre  pSecondp  precodeCALayer layer  [[CALayer alloc] init]  NSLogretain count d,  [layer retainCount]  log retain count 1 layer.opaque  YES increases the retain count, WHY NSLogretain count d,  [layer retainCount]  log retain count 2  [layer release]  no problem so far  [layer release]  this leads NOT to a crash as expected codepre  pIn the first snippet, everything occurs as I expect it, also the crash zombie ... at the second release message.p  pIn the second one, unexpected things happen. Calling any message after init e.g. layer.opaque  YES increases the retain counter by one, but only the first call of a message. So the retain counter is allways 1 to high. To proof that this is not just a number problem, I used the second release. The layer will only be freed from memory after the second release.p  pThe behaviour of this could also be produced with autorelease.p  pSo, why does a message to the layer increase its retain count Did I miss some Infromation about retain and release issuesp  pThanks in advancep  pMarcop

Negative 13591 pOk so i am new to making complex database structure into the page. I have a basic people table with a few categories. Students, teachers, parents and mods. There are again tables one for parents, students and teachersmods. Its basically a schools website.p  pNow for example for a profile page where a students info is showed to parents. Info like who are teachers, subjects, attendance, homework, etc. This will query a lot of tables. So what is my best bet here I plan to do it in a webapp way. I was thinking maybe i can JSON data to page with ajax and let javascript do the heavy lifting of calculation. All the tables will only be queried once.p  pSo is it even ok to do so or will i face some hidden problems when i have dug my feet too deep in it Maybe i can go one more level deep and make a huge JSON with entire database being sent to user and then it is cached in the browser. I dont have to support really old browsers p  pAlso things like attendance and marksresult will need to be calculated every time. Is there any way to cache the result per student like wen a parent views a students result, it calculates it once and then caches it for x number of days on the server somehow.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAnother non JSON approach i can think of is traditional way. I do all the things on server side with php. This means i wont have to worry about browser compatibility. Maybe i can make a call to all the needed tables in the beginning and store it is an array.

In the database, some records have been entered so remaining 781 records need to inserted.p  pThe problem is that there are 2 tables, one is departmentalservices and the other is deptservicedetails. Departmental service table has service name among other things and is joined to deptservicedetails by a column called serviceid. Deptservicedetails is where the charge for that service will be present as there are cash and credit charges but dont worry about that. Departmental services has all the service names but the charges for each of them is not present in the details table.p  pNow if I use the program normally to insert the charges, its gonna take long as you know.

But I got a 500 internal server error em.htaccess ltDirectory not allowed hereemp  pThe second idea was to use emSetEnvem and ltIfDefinegt. But emIfDefineem is not able to read environmentvariables as shown in a hrefhttpturboflash.wordpress.com20100527apacheenvironmentvariablesvisibilitywithsetenvsetenvifandrewriteruledirectives relnofollowthis blog entrya.p  pThe specific paths and servers are known.p  pIs there a way to find out on which server the .htaccess is called and to set the specific path for the AuthFilep

Negative 13591 pSo I have this website that has a large image as the background. Now instead of fading the image of to a flat colour or pattern, I needed it to scale to 100 of the viewport width.p  pThis doesnt solve the problem that youd only be able to see a portion of the image depending on the browser size and I need to have the whole image viewable. Just scrolling down wont suffice because then the image would end and what ever colour I chose for the background would appear this is bad.p  pSo I was thinking what if I could havep  ul lithe background image scale to 100 of the width of the viewport with a minimum size of the image width strongandstrongli lialso animate vertically down on scroll stronguntilstrongli liyou reach the end of the image height, which it will then stop until you scroll back up and it resumes to the top of the image,li liwith a parallax effect.li ul  pHaving each of these separately is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5001447jqueryonwindowscrollanimatebackgroundimagepositioneasya a hrefhttpbuildinternet.comprojectsupersized relnofollowenougha but I havent been able to find a combination of them and with a modification to limit vertical scrolling.

Negative 13591 pIve read that using codeObject.prototypecode to attach functions to custom JavaScript objects is more efficient than the traditional method of codethis.foo  functioncode. The problem Ive run into is scope. I want these public methods to be able to access private variables of the object. What I ended up doing was thisp  precodefunction Foo     var id  5     Foo.prototype.bar  function         alertid       var x  new Foo x.bar codepre  pI nested the prototype declaration inside the object definition. This works and seems to solve the problem. Is there any reason to NOT do this Is there a better or more standard way to accomplish thisp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Based on some of the responses Ive received I guess I need to mention that Im fully aware that there is no concept of a codeprivatecode variable in JavaScript. I use the term codeprivatecode here meaning not accessible outside the current scope because its easier to say and write and I assume that anyone trying to answer this question would know what was meant by me using the term codeprivatecode.p

Negative 13591 pIm using ZF for an MVC application and am massively confused about how my code should be structured.p  pIve got a procedural application which is basically 1 huge long file with functions for everything I want my app to do.... like getUsernameid etc. So now Im remaking the entire thing in ZF because my current codebase is unworkable, crap and hard to debug.p  pIm new to MVC and massively confused about how it should all be laid out, what should talk to what etc. So I know about Views about being templates and Controllers needing to be skinny and that you should have fat models but Im confused where the logic needs to be.p  pIm making a game and there usual objects like.... Users, Villages, Armies, MapSquares, Resources etc.p  pIf I was thinking about it completely by theory I would just say 1 User Object contains many villages, each village belongs to one square and contains an army which contains many units.p  pSo what I thought was that my Models should contain no logic, just a list of get and set functions for retrieving the data and that the logic for processing, asking questions should be done inside the Mapper... likep  precodevillageMapper  new VillageMapper  Get village from database using mapper  village  villageMappergtgetVillageid, new Village codepre  pWhen I want to determine say the outcome of two villages attacking one another, where would this be done Would I do something likep  precodeoutcome  villageMappergtdetermineAttackOutcomevillage1, village2 codepre  pOr would I have say... a battle object with a bit of logic inside itp  precodebattle  new Battle  Add participants battlegtaddAttackervillage1gtaddDefendervillage2 outcome  battlegtperformAttack  Save village changes cause of battle villageMappergtsavebattlegtgetAttacker villageMappergtsavebattlegtgetDefender codepre  pI have a bunch of DbTable php files, which I guess all the Database code lives in... so my question is Should my Mapper objects ONLY really be used for things like, getting and saving to the databasep  pThanks, Domp

Negative 13591 pAccording to the Stevens TCPIP Illustrated the strongtraceroutestrong program sends UDP packets to the destination host with an incremental TTL 1, 2, 3, etc to get the intermediate hops info from the strongICMP TTL EXPIREDstrong messages. br The emdestination reachedem condition is an strongICMP PORT UNREACHABLEstrong message, because traceroute addresses a random port with an high number that is unlikely someone is listening there br So my question is is there a technical reason drawbacks, RFCs, etc. to use UDP packets rather than using, for instance, strongICMP echo requeststrong messages with increasing TTL and use the strongecho replystrong answer as the end condition br I understand that the ICMP echo reply might be filtered out by firewalls or other net devices in the middle, but I guess this can happen also to UDP packets p  pMany Thanks br Sergiop

Im using the iFrame inside of an iFrame that refers back to the parent domain in order to communicate my height back to it.  I completely understand the concept and had this implemented fairly easily.  The issue is that when I try to get the document.height from jQuery as such or just by document.body.scrollHeight Im seeing strange results in all browsers when my page is referenced inside of the iFrame.  p  pHere is some background to what is happening on my page.  Im making some ajax calls to search a service of a third party provider and generating html inside of my page based on the results, pretty standard stuff.  By the way, I am waiting for my html to be added to the DOM before grabbing the height of the document.  Here are the results from document.height when my page is inside of the iFrame.p  pFireFox 10.0.2 where the height picked up is almost 1000 pixels or more smaller than the actual height of the document.p  pGoogle Chrome 18.0.1025.162 will most of the time pick up the correct height.  Sometimes the height is smaller by only a few hundred pixels.p  pSafari 5 behaves like FireFox does as well.p  pIve seen many blog posts with code showing the behavior.  It doesnt matter if I use jQuery or what is available to me with the javascript document object.  Im always seeing inconsistent results coming back from either one of those calls.  I have to believe other people that have used this technique have ran in to this.p  pI dont need to show my code for the iFrame resize or helper iFrame since these are functioning as expected.  The main code I want to show is how I start the resize process from my search form after the ajax event and dom manipulation has finishedp  precodefunction resizeMe      var iFrameHelper  iFrameHelper     iFrameHelper.attrsrc, iFrameHelper.attrdataurl  height  document.height  ampcacheb  Math.random  codepre

Negative 13591 pIf I have a python file that has no suffix.  Can pydev read that file as a python file using the first line of the file if it includes a usrbinpython  Im not really concerned specifically about using that first line, just that that line exists and might be useable.  If there is a manual way to mark a file as a python file without mucking with its suffix thatd be fine as well.p

Negative 13591 pI know that this question had already been asked a couple of times before, but I just want to clarify this. I have a pdf reader and I want to add a highlight function to it. I can already extract the text by parsing the codeTjcode and codeTJcode operators. Right now I want to find the location of the text in pdf.p  pAt first I tried to find the codeTmcode values. I was able to extract the x,y of the codeTmcode, but it doesnt seem right. So I decided to go for the codeTdcode and codeTDcode. The problem is it seems like the pdf does not contain any codeTdcode or codeTDcode values, since the operator callbacks are never called. I put a log in the callback just to see if it is being called, but it never showed up.p  pSo my question is if I want to find the position of the text in the pdf, which shall I look into The codeTmcode values or the codeTdTDcode values Or is it bothp  pADDITIONAL QUESTIONp  pTm has six parameters codea, b, c, d, ecode and codefcode. I know that codeecode and codefcode represents the codetxcode and codetycode, but what does the other four parameters representp

Negative 13591 pSuppose I have a class codeBazcode that inherits from classes codeFoocode and codeBarcode, in that order. The constructor for class codeBarcode takes a pointer to a codeFoocode object. What I would like to do is to pass codethiscode as the codeFoocode object to the codeBarcode constructorp  precodeBaz   Foo, Barthis  codepre  pA working examplep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt class Bar class Foo    public   virtual Foo    virtual void parsebar Baramp const  0     class Bar    private   const Foo  parser   public   Bar const Foo  parserin  parserparserin    virtual Bar    void parseself   parsergtparsebar this      class Baz  public Foo, public Bar    public   Baz   Foo, Barthis    virtual void parsebar Bar amp const  stdcout ltlt Hello Worldn    int main     Baz baz   baz.parseself  codepre  pThis happens to work on my computer, with my compilers tested with a couple of them. However section 9.3.2 of the 2003 standard makes me a bit uneasy that I might just be getting lucky, that using codethiscode this way is undefined behavior. Strictly speaking, the initializer list is outside the body of the constructor. Heres the relevant text, emphasis mine  p  blockquote   p9.3.2 The codethiscode pointerbr   In the strongbodystrong of a nonstatic member function, the keyword codethiscode is a nonlvalue expression whose value is the address of the object for which the function is called.p blockquote  pSo is my usage legal and welldefined, or is it undefined behaviorp

Negative 13591 pI am having a problem that seems simple on the surface but I cant find an answer anywhere.  I am trying to set the MaintainScrollPositionOnPostback property of the pages in my web app to true.  I have it set to true in my web.config, I am setting it programmatically in the codebehind of my page, I have it set to true in my pages directive, yet anytime I step through and debug, it is showing as false.  In fact, if I set a breakpoint on the line of code emimmediately afterem I set it to true, it is still showing as false.  Naturally, all of my pages jump to the top after every postback which is annoying.  This is happening even on a page with no master page and no base page, so I dont have any extra code stepping on my changes.  If I create a brand new web application from scratch this property works as expected.  Does anyone have any clues as to what might cause this property to behave this way  It is as if there is some global configuration that is implicitly forcing this property to be disabled, but I cannot find any documentation explaining such an effect.p

Negative 13591 pIt had been my understanding that copyonwrite is not a viable way to implement a conforming codestdstringcode in C11, but when it came up in discussion recently I found myself unable to directly support that statement.p  pAm I correct that C11 does not admit COW based implementations of codestdstringcodep  pIf so, is this restriction explicitly stated somewhere in the new standard wherep  pOr is this restriction implied, in the sense that it is the combined effect of the new requirements on codestdstringcode that precludes a COW based implementation of codestdstringcode. In this case, Id be interested in a chapter and verse style derivation of C11 effectively prohibits COW based codestdstringcode implementations.p

Negative 13591 pI am trying to uninstall existing version of MSI automatically during the installation of newer MSI. p  pI referred N number of articles and blogs which refer to Upgrade Code, Product Code, the properties of Setup project like RemovePreviousVersions, DetectNewerInstalledVersion, versions, versions of DLLs from AssemblyInfo file AssemblyFileVersion etc....p  pUsing these informations, I have one solution with me to do the above task.

Which exactly performs the activity that I require and for the same I have framed the question as follows. Please throw some light on this query...p  pemThe Install action by right clicking on setup project from VS 2010, uninstalls the older version of product irrespective of the value of RemovePreviousVersions property and then goes ahead with installation of latest version.

Negative 13591 pI have a tried and tested enterprise iPhone app thats been in heavy use for over a year, and works great.  The app makes frequent use of asynchronous NSURLConnectionRequests to fetch data from  a server. p  pI monitor availability of network connectivity using Apples Reachability sample code.  Ive always considered the Reachability code to be a bit fragile, but Ive had it working solidly for many months  iOS 4.3 onwards.p  pHowever, Im now seeing a problem since upgrading to iOS 6.  Seemingly randomly, after a day or two of dipping in and out of the app, I open the app and notice via the console that the app is receiving repeated network available notifications from the Reachability class.p  pIf I stop the task and I mean, properly stop, and relaunch, the problem goes away, and the app behaves normally again.p  pOf course, this could be down to a subtle issue with my integration of the Reachability code Ive mentioned that I consider it fragile, but Im wondering if anyone has seen something similar since updating to iOS 6p  pI did have a play with the iOS 6  Settings  Developer Settings  Network Link Conditioner, and it certainly feels like this problem has appeared since then, but its definitely now turned off, and Ive rebooted the device.p  pAnyone else seeing Reachability issues since updating to iOS 6p

Negative 13591 pIm on three days of searching with no luck.  I have datatable1 in access database.  I populate datatable 2 from csv file from third party.  I need to compare both datatables and update any changes or add new rows to datatable1.  DT1 can have a primary key doesnt at this time.  csv file doesnt have primary key and datatable 2 needs to be cleared after updating datatable 1.  Merge getchanges method will not work since there isnt a primary key.  Need suggestions on how to do this.p  pLet me see if I can make this as short as possible.  I have data from a site that I can only get in csv files.  There are three csv files Purchase Orders, Packages, and shipments.  As POs get completed and paid the site dumps the data.  I need to be able to pull this data in and retain for my purposes.  So where I am at now is that I have an access data base with 6 tables.  3 permanent and 3 temp tables. The temp tables are cleaned with each import of csv file.  I need to compare the temp table and updateadd to the permanent tables.  Package and shipments have a field that is unique and I can set as a primary key.  PO does not.  There are three columns that would need to be combined to make a unique primary key Purchase order, Line number, Line Shipment number.  I cannont get merge getchanges to work on Packages or shipments returns null and the lack of primary key that method wont work on PO.  Let me know if this is confusing Ill try to get more detailed.p

Negative 13591 pOkay, so Ive done this a million times before and I cant for the life of me figure out whats going wrong. So, Ive got a Sql Server table called GeneralInfo which when a user logs in will already have data in it. The user will access a form called VendorInput, but to make sure that they dont accidently gain access to a row from GeneralInfo that they shouldnt be able to view, they have to verify what form they are filling out. I have another table called QuoteAccess which specifies which vendors have access to which rows in GeneralInfo. p  pGeneralInfop  precodepublic partial class GeneralInfo      public GeneralInfo              ...          this.QuoteAccesses  new HashSetltQuoteAccessgt           public int QuoteID  get set       ...              public virtual ICollectionltQuoteAccessgt QuoteAccesses  get set   codepre  pQuoteAccessp  precodepublic partial class QuoteAccess      public QuoteAccess              this.VendorInfo  new HashSetltVendorInfogt           public int QuoteAccessID  get set      public int GeneralInfoQuoteID  get set      public string Prefix  get set       public virtual GeneralInfo GeneralInfo  get set      public virtual ICollectionltVendorInfogt VendorInfo  get set   codepre  pVendorFormControllerp  precode[HttpPost]     public ActionResult Indexint id  0              if ModelState.IsValid                      int ids  id             return RedirectToActionBeginForm, VendorForm, new  id  ids                   return View           [HttpGet]     public ActionResult BeginFormint id  0              GeneralInfo generalinfo  new GeneralInfo          generalinfo  unitOfWork.GeneralInfoRepository.GetByIDid          return Viewgeneralinfo           [HttpGet]     [ChildActionOnly]     public ActionResult Quantitiesint id  0               GeneralInfo generalinfo  unitOfWork.GeneralInfoRepository.GetByIDid          IEnumerableltQuantitygt getQuantities  unitOfWork.QuantityRepository.Get          IEnumerableltQuantitygt qtys  getQuantities.Whereq gt q.GeneralInfoQuotesID  generalinfo.QuoteID          return PartialViewqtys      codepre  pIndexp  precodemodel SourceMvc.QuoteAccess     ViewBag.Title  Index   lth2gtPlease enter the ID for the quote you are submittinglth2gt  using Html.BeginForm  Html.ValidationSummarytrue ltfieldsetgt     ltlegendgtQuoteAccessltlegendgt     ltdiv classeditorlabelgt         Quote ID     ltdivgt     ltdiv classeditorfieldgt         Html.EditorFormodel gt model.GeneralInfoQuoteID         Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.GeneralInfoQuoteID     ltdivgt     ltinput idsubmit typesubmit gt ltfieldsetgt  codepre  pBeginForm this just provides a look at whats in GeneralInfo before the user begins to fill out their formp  precodemodel SourceMvc.GeneralInfo       ViewBag.Title  BeginForm   lth2gtBeginFormlth2gt  ltfieldsetgt ltlegendgtGeneralInfoltlegendgt  ltdiv classdisplaylabelgt      Html.DisplayNameFormodel gt model.QuoteID ltdivgt ltdiv classdisplayfieldgt     Html.DisplayFormodel gt model.QuoteID ltdivgt  ....

Whats really confusing me, is I have similar code elsewhere on my site that works fine. If I manually edit the URL to say VendorFormBeginForm1 where 1 can be any valid id...currently the URL loads with a 0 regardless of what the user enters in on the previous page the page loads properly, and when I try to debug the application, the post method for Index isnt setting id or ids to equal whatever the user entered into the form, it just remains zero. Because of that, the number 0 is getting passed to the get method for BeginForm instead of what ever the user entered in on the Index page. Like I said, Ive got similar functionality in other places on my site and they all work fine. I must be missing something really simple, so Im hoping a different set of eyes looking at this will reveal something. p  pThanks in advance to anyone who can help.p

Negative 13591 pI have a UITableView that is populated from an array of data that is parsed from an XML feed. Im struggling to find the cause of this error and was wondering if anyone can help me.

Negative 13591 pI have a fairly good amount of knowledge with Batch. Im trying to port a batch script over to MacUNIX, but my batch file has a draganddrop thing to it. Through countless Google searches, I have came up with nothing. They all say that you can draganddrop into a Terminal Window  not good for noinputrequired scripts. Here is the code for Batch I havep  pcodecd USERPROFILEp  pcode7za x  oUSERPROFILEDesktopTempcodep  pcode7za a 1 USERPROFILEDesktopTempcodep  pcodecd USERPROFILEDesktopcode rmdir q s Tempcodep  pNot particularly worried about 7za commands because of Archive Utility,cd USERPROFILE because Terminal starts in the users profile, rmdir, cd, and such, as they are only basic file commands. But I dont know the code to reference to the file droppedopened with the .sh script. So, if someone knows that code, please tell me. I know this is kindof a simple thing, but you cant know every command, especially when dealing with unfamiliar programming languages. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 13591 pI have the following problemp  pEvents have a begin and end time and an amount. I use MySQL DATETIME for both.p  pNow if I have a constraint that says no overlapping events I need to make some checks etc. but how to design that The user only needs 5mins precision or so, but i want to do calculations with seconds since that is simplercleanerp  pIf I have an event A with startend YYYYMMDD 120000YYYYMMDD 140000 p  pand anotherp  pB YYYYMMDD 140000YYYYMMDD 161500  they are nonoverlapping even though they both contain 140000.p  pIn order to determine that they are indeed nonoverlapping should I usep  pA.end lt B.begin etc.p  pOrp  pA.end lt B.begin etc. AND make a hack such that all endtimes are DATE HHMM00 minus one second instead of DATE HHMM00 i.e. A.end would then be YYYYMMDD 135959 instead of YYYYMMDD 140000p  pThe first is simplest, but will it miss any overlaps if I have a lot of different events and need to check that i dont overbook i.e. that the events individual amounts dont exceed the total amount example if each event is a booking of a table with a number of persons, I cant exceed the total number of tables at any given timep

Negative 13591 pIm trying to find a solution to a rails design that isnt all that obvious to me. A friend who is very good with this stuff has given me his take on it, but I wondered if there is a rails pattern  the knowledge Im missing is how rails creates the relationshipp  pI have a problem space like this. Users can perform more than one role at more than one organisation. So for example, a user can be both a Standard User and an Power User at Organisation 1, but an Admin at Organisation 2.p  pIm using Devise and CanCan. I have a Users table, Roles and an Organisations table and a rolesusers table to manage that manytomany relation. Then I have a userorganisations table, which stores the M2M between a user and the organisations. This all works okay. When I do thisp  precodeuser  User.new email gt adminexample.com,  password gt password,  passwordconfirmation gt password,  firstname gt TestFirstName, surname gt TestSurName  org1  Org.newfullname gt Test Org 1 org1.save  org2  Org.newfullname gt Test Org 2 org2.save  user.org ltlt Org.first user.org ltlt Org.last  user.roles ltlt Role.wherenamegtadministrator.first user.roles ltlt Role.wherenamegtPowerUser.first codepre  pI get as you would expect two orgs, and a user registered at both.p  pThe missing bit is the roles. I have a new model using through assignment, rolesuserorgs, which is meant to be the link between the userorg table and the roles, and store the role for the user by using the primary key of the userorg and the roles id. But it is never populated. I dont know if this is because I am not writing the insert correctly to populate it, or because my relations arent correct   or  because the design is plain wrong and wont work in rails. The simper model is to use an orgid in the userroles table, but I dont know how to populate thisp  pHeres my associations...p  precodeclass Role  hasmany userroles, dependent gt destroy hasmany users, through gt userroles, uniq gt true  hasmany roleuserorgs, dependent gt destroy hasmany userorgs, through gt roleuserorgs   class Org hasmany userorgs hasmany users, through gt userorgs  class UserOrg belongsto org belongsto user  hasmany roleuserorgs, dependent gt destroy hasmany roles, through gt roleuserorgs  class UserRole belongsto User belongsto role  class User hasmany userroles hasmany roles, through gt userroles hasmany userorgs hasmany orgs, through gt userorgs   class RoleUserOrg belongsto role belongsto userorgs codepre

What Im trying to do is that I want a codesum of 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 in 1.2 or 1.1 and 1.2 in 1 cell because they are sub categoriescode. However, there is not a field in query or table for 1.2 or 1. This means that I have to create a sum for these fields. In multiple items form, 1 and 1.2 cells are empty because I created form according to budget items and if there is not any data for 1 then access makes that field blank. How can I create a sum for these fields I tried to split this multiple item form and tried to filter according to budget code like code1. or 1.2..code But I couldnt split it.

Negative 13591 pI am profiling a PHP website that seems a little slower than it should be with XDebug.p  pI checked the profile information with KCacheGrind and according to that, 80  of the load time is caused by fopen.p  pHowever, when I add statements to the code before and after the fopen call to measure how long it is taking, it does not seem to be taking even close to the 80 reported by XDebug.p  pThis method reports that it is taking around 2 seconds to complete the fopen call, the page is taking around 25 seconds to load  a large jump from the 80 reported by XDebug.p  pIs it really the fopen call slowing everything down and if not, how can I find out what isp  pIf it is not, how can I get more accurate information from XDebugp  pEdit It seems that although the call completes, it is still counted by XDebug as current until the connection is closed and it hangs until it times out. After manually closing the connection the stats seem to be a bit better.p

Negative 13591 pI wanted to achieve something resembling functional reactive programming in JavaFX and I thought that since JavaFX already supports listeners and bindings between properties it should be fairly easy, so I have created small framework for bindings with conversion, e.g. I now am able to do something like this example in Scala, but it should be possible to understand what I meanp  precodeval property1 Property[String] val property2 Property[Path]  Bindings.Conversions     .bindUniproperty1.toproperty2     .usingp gt p.getFileName.toString     .connect codepre  pHere I bind value of codeproperty2code which is a codejava.nio.file.Pathcode through a conversion function which takes the last part of the path and converts to a string to the codeproperty1code which is string.p  pThe implementation of this is really simple even for bidirectional bindings I simply took some code from openjfx codeBidirectionalBindingcode class, translated it to Scala and adapted it for conversions, and I wonder why there is no such thing in JavaFX already.p  pThis all works well, and I even can create complex chains of such bindings. All is OK unless conversion function depends on some external state.p  pSuppose, for example, that you have the following chain of bindingsp  precodeText field value  1gt  intermediate java.nio.file.Path  2gt  another String  gt  Label codepre  pWhen text field changes, codePathcode and codeStringcode are recomputed automatically, and the value of the String property is written to the label. All is wonderful. But suppose that code2gtcode conversion should depend on toggled state of some checkboxp  precode                                       Checkbox state                                                              Text field value  1gt  intermediate java.nio.file.Path  2gt  another String  gt  Label codepre  pThat is, when checkbox is checked, transformation should be slightly different.p  pDirect implementation of such construction wont work, obviously, because change of checkbox state does not toggle recomputation of the transformation chain. However, I found that JavaFX does not provide any means for forcing change events. I tried overriding codeSimpleStringPropertycode, for example, and exposing its codefireValueChangedEventcode method, but this didnt help. Currently Im doing something like codetextField.setText textField.setTextoldValuecode but this is emveryem ugly and is not the right way, obviously.p  pAm I missing something, and it is really possible to do what I want to do, or there is no such thing at all and Im completely screwed herep  pIf the answer is no, then I think this severly damages expressiveness of the whole framework. I understand that I really can do what I want to with a number of listeners, but this will be ugly, and I want to make the whole thing as general as possible.p

Negative 13591 pIn one of our projects, I have a need to build a library, using codewafcode. The library has multiple steps, like it embuilds a binaryem, then emexecutesem the binary to generate a few more files, and those files are included in further builds. To emrunem the binary which got generated in the intermediate step, I need its   path  as string, so that I can prefix to the binary. From the Waf book, I saw an example, and some references to codebld.path.finddircode and codebld.path.parent.finddircode. But these functions do not return path as string.  And, there is codebld.path.abspathcode which returns the source path as string.p  pI want to be able to get the path to the binary file which got generated.

Should I check char by char and then call specific functions or use regular expressions explained belowp  pstrongBy using regular expressions I dont mean one pattern for whole tag.strong I rather mean using  one pattern for tagname and if this one returns true, check next patterns, then for attribute and if this one returns true, check again, and lastly check for end of tag.p  pWhat should I do when I find tag Run a loop which checks for tags and if it finds tag, call it again and again... But for me it seems like recursive function or at least halfrecursive when function X calls Y which calls X...p  pSo the final question is what is the most efficient and correct structure for thatp
Negative 13591 pWe would like to use the subversion external link ability, but have hit a wall on getting external links to work in the way that we need them given that we probably have an abnormal arrangement of source.p  pThe use case is such, we have an external library 1 and library 2. Library 1 can be built by itself C libraries, without Library 2. Library 2 however has to be built inside Library 1s source tree. If you checkout the code we have a tree like suchp  pmycheckouttrunkexternlibrary1library2p  pNow, above, library1 is an external link to a source tree. The directory library2 we would like to be an external link to another source tree.p  pWe have projects that dont need library2 as library 2 is quite large so we cant create an external link inside library 1s source tree. Also projects using library 1 are long in production so they are not willing to change there checkout procedures to accommodate any checkout differences unfortunately.p  pIs there a way around thisp  pThanks.p

Negative 13591 pI have a class, which I use as a basis for my unit tests. In this class I initialize the whole environment for my tests, setting up database mappings, enter a number of database records across multiple tables, etc. That class has a method with a BeforeClass annotation which does the initialization. Next thing, I extend that class with specific classes in which I have Test methods.p  pstrongMy question is, since the before class is exactly the same for all these test classes, how can I ensure that they are run only once for all the tests.strong  One simple solution is that I could keep all the tests in one class. However, the number of tests is huge, also they are categorised based on functional heads. So they are located in different classes. However since they need the exact same setup, they inherit the BeforeClass. As a result the whole setup is done at least once per test class, taking much more time in total than I would prefer. p  pI could, though, put them all in various subpackages under one package, hence if there is a way, how I can run set up once for all the tests within that package, it would be great.p

Negative 13591 pWhen does the timer begin for a read timeout in the HTTP requestresponse lifecycle Lets say I have a client with a one minute read timeout and my request contains lots of data large binary for instance.

Negative 13591 pI am making a game using Lua and I need to use Breadthfirst search to implement a fast pathfinding algorithm which finds the shortest path between the enemy AI and the player. p  pI will have up to 3 enemies using this algorithm at once and map is a 2dimensional tilebased maze. I have already implemented collision detection so now all that is left to do is get a way for the enemies to find the shortest path to the player in a way that can be done quickly and and preferably about 8090 times per second per enemy.p  pWhen I previously implemented breadthfirst search, I used a queue in C. From what I have read about Lua, stack implementations using tables are very efficient since the elements dont need to be shifted after codepushcode AKA table.insert and codepopcode table.remove operations. However, I have theorized that queues with large sizes can be very inefficient in Lua, because if you want to insertremove something from index 1 of a table, all other elements in the table must be shifted either upward or downward in the table.p  pThus, I would like to ask some simple questions for those experienced in Lua. What is the simplest andor fastest implementation of a queue in this language Is it even possible to have a fast queue in Lua or is it just generally accepted that Lua will always be forced to shift all elements for a queue operation such as codepopcode or codeappendcode p  pEDIT I understand that the underlying implementation of shifting elements in Lua tables is written in C and is therefore quite optimized. I just would like to know if I have any better options for queues before I begin to write a simple table implementation.p

When I use unmodified time, in other code from here, the clock moves at a standard pace, but when I try to get this code to feed the clock code, something is out of bounds.p  pThe code Ive been working on, as an approximation, isp  precodeNSDate now  [[NSDate alloc] init] NSDate factory  [[NSDate alloc] init] NSDate summerSolstice2013  [factory initWithTimeIntervalSinceReferenceDatereferenceSummerSolstice] double distanceAlong  [now timeIntervalSinceDatesummerSolstice2013] double angleAlong  MPI  2  distanceAlong  2  referenceWinterSolstice  referenceSummerSolstice double currentHeight  cosangleAlong  latitudeAngle  tiltAngle ... if secondsAreNatural      secondsAreShadowed  FALSE     double dayDuration  12  60  60  12  60  60  sincurrentHeight     double midday  fmod24  60  60  longitudeAngle  2  MPI  12  60  60, 24  60  60     double sunrise  midday  dayDuration  2     double sunset  midday  dayDuration  2     double seconds  fmod[now timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate], 24  60  60     double proportionAlong  0     if seconds lt sunrise              naturalSeconds  seconds  sunset  24  60  60  sunrise  sunset  24  60  60          else if seconds gt sunset              naturalSeconds  12  60  60  seconds  sunset  sunrise  24  60  60  sunset  18  60  60          else              naturalSeconds  12  60  60  seconds  sunrise  sunset  sunrise  6  60  60       codepre  pAre there any problems given that this approximation can probably be refined to any extent you can pinpoint in this codep  pThanks,p  pEDITp  pThe code I wrote above was fairly demanding in terms of the loose ends presented to someone reading it.

Negative 13591 pI was looking at the Python speech libraries in this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1936828howgetsoundinputfrommicrophoneinpythonandprocessitontheflyposta. Im in a quiet office environment and I have to speak to people on a handheld phone but Id rather not disturb people around me if I dont have to. p  pI feel that if I typed on a keyboard on a computer and my text was converted into speech and I could feed that speech into the port of a microphone Virtual then Ill be able to communicate simply by typing and they can hear a robot voice on the other end. p  pFor clarity I dont want to use the phone. I want to use the computer. I want to type on the keyboard that is connected to the computer and have that text converted into speech and feed it into the microphone port of my computer so it can send that computerized voice into the GoToMeeting application. This way it looks as though Im speaking into the microphone but Im not, Im just typing. I want the computer to think Im talking into the microphone in order to have other applications e.g. GoToMeeting be able to interpret it.p  pAnd the GoToMeeting chat client is useless due its default setting of hiding the chat. Many people ignore the chat unless youre speaking.p  pMy preference would be some kind of library that would allow me to create a virtual microphone so I could write audio to it. I would ultimately want to run this in Linux with a Windows VM running GoToMeeting. This way I can continue to use Linux, type in the text, and pipe in the speech into the VM so GoToMeeting users can hear me.p  pThanksp

I have concluded that my problem must be recursion.p  pTo confirm this I have wrote a small handler in my main windows procedure to test thisp  precodecase WMCOMMAND     switch HIWORD wParam            case ENUPDATE         if LOWORDwParam  IDCOFMYEDITCONTROL                        static int counter  0    increment it each time we get ENUPDATE               after we receive ENUPDATE 4 times stop testing              if  counter lt 4                                  wchart text[10]   get sample text                  GetWindowText HWNDlParam, text, 10                    change current char to char  1                  which means A will be B, B will be C and so on...                  for int i  0 i lt wcslentext i                      text[i]  wchart 1  text[i]                      SetWindowText HWNDlParam, text     show changed text                               break          break  case WMCLOSE  WMCLOSE and other handlers... codepre  pThis is what happens when I start my program in codeDebugcode modep  pAfter I type letter codeacode the text of the edit control turns into codeecode.p  pThis confirms my conclusion about recursion After I have pressed codeacode it was converted to codebcode, then another codeENUPDATEcode fired off, which repeated the process so codebcode turned into codeccode and so on until codestaticcode variable reached code4code so the result was codeecode.p  pMy question is simplep  pHow should I handle codeENUPDATEcode, or modify my program, in order to avoid this type of recursion p  h2EDIT  February 18th, 2014 h2  pI have modified the above codeENUPDATEcode handler per member emJonathan Potterems instructions.p  pAlthough recursion problem disappeared, the output is not what I have desired.p  pI have verified the correctness of my code for substituting a character with his successor in a simple console application and by doing the same when clicking on a button  it wasnt hard for me to quickly add a button and a handler for clicking on it .p  pSo the problem must be the implementation of the given instructions, therefore I submit the corrected code in hope that someone will point out what did I do wrongp  precodecase ENUPDATE     if LOWORDwParam  IDCOFMYEDITCONTROL              static bool OKtoprocesstext  true          if OKtoprocesstext                       OKtoprocesstext  false              wchart text[10]             memset text, L0, sizeoftext               GetWindowText HWNDlParam, text, 10               for sizet i  0 i lt wcslentext i                  text[i]  wchart 1  text[i]               SetWindowText HWNDlParam, text                OKtoprocesstext  true                   break  break codepre  pNow, after pressing codeacode it properly turns into codebcode, but after I press codebcode I do not get the expected result codebccode but codecccode.p  pThis is expected, since after user presses a key codeENUPDATEcode is generated to display text.p  pTherefore when pressing codeacode it will convert to codebcode. When I press codebcode strongafterwards, a new codeENUPDATEcode message is generatedstrong, so my handler starts over, which means that it takes new string codebbcode and properly converts it to codecccode. p  pIs there a way to suppress temporarily creation of a new codeENUPDATEcode message while manipulating with current text so in the example above I get the result codebccode instead of codecccode when I press codeacode and then codebcodep  h2END OF EDITh2  pThank you for your time and help.p  pBest regards.p

Invalidates all references, pointers, and   iterators referring to the elements of a and may invalidate the   pasttheend iterator.p blockquote  pDoes it mean in C11 an implementation is allowed to deallocate and change the capacity of a vector upon a call to codeclearcode  Can we expect codev.clearcode to have the same effect as codevectorltTgt.swapvcodep  pPS Another question of mine also related to vector storage a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22253355whathappenstotheunderlyingstorageuponvectorscopymoveassignmentWhat happens to the underlying storage upon vector39s copymove assignmentabr Any input is highly appreciated on that one too.p

Negative 13591 pI am creating a website in which I need to show some resources like PDFs,videos online.

Negative 13591 pIm working on an application that stores data in CouchDB and I want to generate UUIDs for new documents within the application, i.e. without using the a hrefhttpscouchdb.readthedocs.orgenlatestapiservercommon.htmluuids relnofollowuuida API or relying on UUIDs to be generated by CouchDB when the documents are inserted. To do this, Im going to recreate the default algorithm that CouchDB uses to generate UUIDs, which works as followsp  pemA generated UUID consists of two parts, a random prefix and a monotonically increasing suffix. The same prefix is used for as long as the suffix doesnt overflow, if it does, a new random prefix is used. The suffix starts at zero and is increased in random steps between 1 and 0xffe.emp  pThis all seems reasonable, especially the part about the random but constant prefix that allows documents that are inserted at the same time to be stored near each other in the document BTree. What I dont understand is why the suffix is increased in random steps instead of just 1 each time. What is the explanation, or a possible explanation, for this decisionp

Negative 13591 pI have a small C not C app that parses command line arguments using codegetoptlongcode.  Im wanting to write another app that shares a number of elements including some common command line parameters but will have some unique stuff too.  As part of this I would like to split the commandline parsing into common in a static library and appspecific.p  pIs it possible to somehow cascade calls to codegetoptlongcode with different option sets, such that if the outer call appspecific options doesnt recognise an option it can try calling the common options parser, without printing any errors to the user unless both dont recognise the option  This would have to be done on an optionbyoption basis as the user would be able to pass the options in any order.p  pI like the simplicity of getopts staticallydefined constant option lookup tables.  I know I could probably generate a single merged table dynamically and just call getopt the once but that seems more painful and Id prefer not to have to do that.p  pMy reading of the docs does not look promising thus far.p

Furthermore, the edit view is rendered identically to the New view, which is wrong.p  pCodep  pUsing Spree Deface, I override a promotions form form.html.erb to yield a New Create view like sop  precode DefaceOverride.newvirtualpath gt spreeadminpromotionsform,                  name gt example3,                  replace gt div.row,                  partial gt sharednewpromotion   codepre  pIn a second override, I override form.html.erb thusp  precode DefaceOverride.newvirtualpath gt spreeadminpromotionsform,                  name gt example3,                  replace gt div.row,                  partial gt shareduploadcsvfile   codepre  pThese overrides currently sit in the same directly. p

Negative 13591 pIve been searching for a solution for a while, but Im coming up empty.  p  pIve got some jQuery logic tied to code.onshown...code for my Bootstrap modal.  Its responsible for modifying select options and disabling fields, along with a few other things.

The modal redisplays with the correct errors, but I need to execute the same jQuery thats tied to codeshowncode.  p  pCurrently, when the modal is redisplayed, the selects contain the unmodified options, for example, the codelt f.input cityid, collection City.active ... gtcode select will show all cities within the codeactivecode scope, but on codeshowncode, I send a code.getJSONcode request to further refine the list of cities in the select, and I need to be able to do that when the invalid form is redisplayed.  p  pIm not sure what other code might be useful to include in my question, so please let me know if I should add other bits.  Im using codesimpleformcode if thats relevant.  p

Negative 13591 pHow do I create an immutable array in Swiftp  pA superficial reading of the docs would suggest you can just do p  precodelet myArray  [1,2,3] codepre  pBut sadly this actually produces a mutable, fixedsize array. This mutability creates the usual puzzles with unsuspected aliasing and functions mutating their argumentsp  precodelet outterArray  [myArray, myArray] outterArray[0][0]  2000 outterArray gt [[2000,2,3],[2000,2,3]]   surprise  func notReallyPurearrInt[] gt   arr[0]  3000  notReallyPuremyArray myArray  gt [3000,2,3] codepre  pNot much better than C.p  pIf I want immutability, is the best option really to wrap it in an codeNSArraycode like sop  precodelet immutableArray  NSArraymyArray [1,2,3] codepre  pThat seems nuts. What am I missing herep  pstrongUPDATE 20150726strongp  pThis question dates from the very early days of Swift. Swift has since then been updated so that immutable arrays are actually immutable, as answers below indicate.p
Negative 13591 pIs there a general practice to validating REST requests, where the data is not the correct datatype E.g. submitting bad value to a int p  pFor example, if we have a Shop item entity, with mixed datatypesp  precodeid int title string price decimal expiry datetime codepre  pAnd we test the add operation on the REST endpoint with a response with bad datap  precode     title New item     price bad value     expiry Not a date  codepre  pstrongQuestionstrong Is there a general practice to replying to requests with bad datap  pSpecifically  Do I need the error codedescription to tell them that the field data is invalid Would it be appropriate to just fall back to a mandatory field required message Either scenario is going back as a HTTP 400p  pstrongAlso, WebAPI  JSON.NETstrong Behind the scenes, I happen to be using Microsofts WebAPIJSON.Net. With the automatic deserialisation to an entity, correct data will map to their propertytypes just fine. Ive also made all properties on the input models to be nullable, so we can validate for missing inputs. So bad data will be treated as a missing required field validation.p  pDropping back to making all properties a string, so we can further validate input seems a step backwards...p

Negative 13591 pIm new to Ruby and am following the Michael Hartls tutorial. Im still on chapter 1.p  pIt says p  precode    undefined local variable or method firstapp for mainObject NameError codepre  pwhich is in my development.rb line 1. p  precode    FirstappApplication.configure do      Settings specified here will take precedence over those in configapplication.rb.       In the development environment your applications code is reloaded on      every request. This slows down response time but is perfect for development      since you dont have to restart the web server when you make code changes.     config.cacheclasses  false       Do not eager load code on boot.     config.eagerload  false       Show full error reports and disable caching.     config.considerallrequestslocal        true     config.actioncontroller.performcaching  false       Dont care if the mailer cant send.     config.actionmailer.raisedeliveryerrors  false       Print deprecation notices to the Rails logger.     config.activesupport.deprecation  log       Raise an error on page load if there are pending migrations.     config.activerecord.migrationerror  pageload       Debug mode disables concatenation and preprocessing of assets.      This option may cause significant delays in view rendering with a large      number of complex assets.     config.assets.debug  true       Adds additional error checking when serving assets at runtime.      Checks for improperly declared sprockets dependencies.      Raises helpful error messages.     config.assets.raiseruntimeerrors  true       Raises error for missing translations      config.actionview.raiseonmissingtranslations  true     end codepre  pI followed other questions on StackOverflow with no solution. Some of them require to changed my app name from p  precode    Rails.application.configure do codepre  pto p  precode    FirstappApplication.configure do  codepre  pwhich didnt resolve anything. Oh and if it helps, Im using Windows.p

We assume the following Atomikos sends a prepare statement to the ActiveMQ broker. After that the broker is shut down. Now the prepared statement is lost at the ActiveMQ side and so Atomikos will try to recover this gone transaction. Because both ActiveMQ broker use the same database we think that the prepared statement should be stored in the database. So the slave broker can resume the transaction. But this doesnt happen.p  pHas anyone an idea if this is a bug of ActiveMQ or if there is a hidden configuration property of ActiveMQ to enable the prepared mode of XA transactionsp  pSide mark we make sure that we use unique ids for the transaction manager name related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6224353activemqjmsxaatomikostransactionnotstartederrorStackoverflow article about Atomikos unique idsap  pThanks.p

I dont know which of the 3 GetXXXXXXXXX functions I need to use to get the palms position.p  pI think the way the shaders calculate the position of the bones is by multiplying them by each of their parent bones.

Negative 13591 pDocumentation tools like YUIDocs allow you to identify and describe Classes object classes using the codeclasscode tag in comment blocks. Each identified Class requires a codestaticcode or codeconstructorcode tag, defined as followsp  ul licodeconstructorcode  Indicates that the class is instantiable created with the new keyword.li licodestaticcode  Indicates that you should not instantiate the class with new. You can call all of the class methods statically.li ul  pIn Ember, you often create subclasses using codeextendcode. To the best of my knowledge, this does not create a new instance of a class. However, many of these definitions e.g. a routes controller are singleton even though you use codeextendcode to define them.p  pThus, my question is in which common situations of documenting Classes in an ember app would you use codeconstructorcode vs codestaticcode Such examples arep  ul liInitializersli liThe Routerli liAdaptersli liSerializersli liTransformationsli liRoutesli liThe Storeli liModelsli liControllersli liViewsli liComponentsli liMixinsli ul  pI dont include Handlebars helpers here because I believe they are actually methods, not classes, but if Im wrong I will correct this question.p

Negative 13591 pMy site uses ASP.Net MVC 5.2.2 and ASP.Net Identity 2.1.0. In CookieAuthenticationOptions I set the ExpireTimeSpan to 30 minutes and the security stamp validation interval is set to 2 minutes so that users will be booted out within two minutes of a call to UserManager.UpdateSecurityStampAsync.p  pThe problem is that if users remain idle for longer than 2 minutes and then click on the Sign Out button, the site fails to log them off. After a bit of sleuthing, I found that in these cases the server returns a new application cookie the cookie sent to the server was different than the one returned from it. What seems to be happening is that the owin code misses the call to AuthenticationManager.SignOut and goes ahead with the generation of a new application cookie, as it normally would have in cases where the old one is more than two minutes old.p  pHas anybody else encountered this issue Any suggestions on how to diagnose and fixp  pI am using VS 2013 Update 3, but this issue existed with previous versions of Identity.p  pUPDATEp  pAs an experiment, I created a brand new ASP.NET Web Application project with the VS 2013 Update 3 templates and noticed the exact same issue I logged in and then waited for an amount of time equal to the security stamp validateInterval by default, 30 minutes. After that I clicked the Log Off link and noticed that, just like in my own project, a I was not logged out, and b a new security stamp cookie was issued to me. I had to click the link a second time to be logged out. In fact, I didnt even need to sit idle for 30 minutes I could keep making requests during that period and the click to the log out button would still fail, as long as it was the first request after the 30minute interval expired.p  pThis seems to be a bug in the OWIN identity code. Basically, if the first request after the validation interval is a signout request, it fails, because the code that validates and issues a new security stamp does not check if the user has logged out as part of the same request. Log out requests will fail, as long as they are part of a request that would cause the reissuance of the security stamp  i.e. the first request that is after validationInterval minutes since issuance of the previous security stamp.p  pI would appreciate it if somebody could confirm this behavior. You dont have to wait 30 minutes and do not have to create a new project. Just take an existing project that uses Identity, temporarily set the validation interval to something really short 30 seconds or a minute, log in, and ensure that the first request after the interval expires is a click on the Logout button. If this is a bug, you should notice that you are still logged in.p

Ultimately these classes must be a hrefhttpswww.khronos.orgopenclsycl relnofollowSYCLa compatible, meaning I am restricted to using C11, including template metaprogramming techniques. stdintegersequence is a C14 STL library addition, and while this restriction of language standard only matters in terms of language features, nothing prevents the STL implementer to use C14 language features while implementing a C14 STL feature, therefore using C14 STL features might not be portable.p  pI am open to suggestions, or even solutions.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pa hrefhttppastebin.comBESRthrd relnofollowHerea is what Iv come up so far. This is the header of Template Metaprogramming tricks I started to collect, and the for loop would be next in line. The helper needs a functor which has the running index as its first parameter, and accepts various predicates. It would keep instantiating the functor as long as the predicate for the next iteration holds true. It would be possible to have the running index increment by any number, be multiplied by a number, etc.p

Example, here is the value i get p  precodevar scaleValue  1.3000 codepre  pI put it as transform attribute this way  p  precodemyItem.setAttributeNSnull,transform,scalescaleValue codepre  pSo now, the svg item has an attribute called transform which contains a scale with a value.p  pLater in my code, i need to get this value back and now come the troubles... I get the value back this way  p  precodevar transformString  myItem.getAttributetransform var scale  transformString.substrtransformString.indexOf,transformString.indexOfscale,01,transformString.indexOf,transformString.indexOfscale1 console.logscale codepre  pConsole.logscale gives me 1.3000... So, the value i get is the good one, BUT i get it as a string Im parsing a string...p  pThen I need to do some stuff with this value, like, on mouseEvent  p  precodevar currentPositionX  event.offsetXundefinedevent.layerXevent.offsetXscale codepre  pSo, at this point, i need the scale to be a float or something I can use to calculate values... and each time i try to do this, i get this message  p  precodeUnexpected NaN value ... codepre  pUPDATE  p  pseems the problem comes from the calculations i have to do. So, first one is get the mouse offset p  precodevar offsetX  event.offsetXundefinedevent.layerXevent.offsetX codepre  pthis gives me a value like 2048, i output it in console like this for example  p  precodeconsole.logparseFloatoffsetX codepre  pand I get the right value displayed. Later i try this  p  precodevar calculated  parseFloatoffsetXparseFloatscale codepre  pand THERE, when i output the result like this  p  precodeconsole.logcalculated codepre  pi get NaN...p  pThanks for help p
Negative 13591 pI have web storage set up for some files in Amazon S3. Im using its PHP SDK to manage these files. I have an automation script running to delete files from a certain bucket after a certain period of time. Ive just realized that I dont believe its actually deleting the files, but replacing them with a delete marker. When I use a program like Transmission Mac to view the bucket, it lists all files since 2013 when I set up the script. But if I go to the management interface in a browser, it only lists files as far back as the cutoff I have set in the script.p  pMy question is am I paying much more money for storage of these markers when I have no need for actually keeping any of these files And how do I permanently delete these files Everything Ive found is that this is only an issue with versioned buckets, but this particular bucket is not versioned. According to the documentation, I need to include the version ID of the object in the delete call to delete the marker, but at this point, how do I retrieve that information since listObjects does not return these.p  pThanks in advancep  pEDIT I should also mention that if I use Transmission to pull down a deleted file, the file still opens and functions as if it were never deleted.p
Negative 13591 pI read a string with some unicode symbols UTF8 in c. The ones I read is stored in 3 bytes, so these characters cant be stored in a single byte, so Im worried about the endianness of these when sent over TCP socket using the functions write and read. Do I need to do anything particular with them to make sure the machine that reads from the stream interprets these unicode characters correctlyp

Negative 13591 pI have hardware that connects to raw TCP socket on any given IP and port combination. It then continually sends characters. The following piece of Python code may give you an idea of what the hardware does.p  precodeimport socket  serverIP  server IP or domain serverPort  60000  Sock  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM Sock.connectserverIP, serverPort while 1 f  open senddata.txt,r while 1     c  f.readline     if not c         break Sock.sendc  n  Sock.shutdown0 Sock.close codepre  pWhen this code is run it exactly behaves like my hardware system. The codesenddata.txtcode file contains characters similar to what hardware sends. p  pI have written a socket server in Python using codeSocketServercode library. It allows connections, receives character stream, and stores it into a local newly created file. Currently, I am running this code on my system, as codelocalhostcode and it works. I would like to serve these files through a webpage.p  pI want to be able to do the same on remote server. As you can see, my hardware limits me to use only raw TCP sockets. From what I understand, Ill need lowlevel access to the server machine like IaaS. I tried a hrefhttpswww.pythonanywhere.com relnofollowpythonanywherea, but I guess they dont allow simple python sockets. Heroku also requires you to write a web app, and I dont know how to go about that or whether itll work with my hardware.  p  pWhat hostingCloud solution out there could act as abovementioned socket server and also as HTTP server which would later serve these files and webpages. p

Negative 13591 pHere is some background to the issue. Ive been looking at it for the past two days and to my knowledge everything is properly configured. To make sure that we are on the same page with versions that are being used I am using the followingp  ul liXcode 6.1li liCode is in Swift with some added ObjectiveC librariesli liOS X is 10.9.5li ul  pI have UISplitView that was added to the storyboard at a later stage of the project. The project was started form Single View template. Normally the left part consist of a UITableView. When Xcode added it to my storyboard it also had a prototype cell setup. Ive added the needed Identifiers and now the prototype cell is accessible in my code. Ive implemented and binded the needed delegate and dataSource protocols and checked that their methods are actually being called and working. Ive also added background colors to the prototype cell and the prototype label and I see a cell when there should be one but it does not have a label. So here is a list what Ive checkedp  ol liData binding is working and data is available. Ive also cross checked this with a second UITableView that is in the project and is working properly. This is also true because I see the background color that was set for the cell when I run the app and data is availablebr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhzgHi.png altenter image description here  li liThe storyboard does not have any errors or warnings. In fact the project itself does not have any warnings on compilationli liIve resetremovedrecreated constraints multiple timesli liIve used the Preview mode and I can see the label rendered properly on my target device and orientation. Ive checked this because storyboard sizing can be easily overseen so that you actually dont have the label for this device and orientation but this is not the casebr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comN5ANt.png altenter image description here  li liIve used the new layout debug feature that Apple added in Xcode 6 called a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comLIBRARYPRERELEASEIOSrecipesxcodehelpdebuggerusingviewdebuggerusingviewdebugger.html relnofollowview debuggera and it does not show a label for this cell.

Negative 13591 pLets say I have four numbers A,B,C,D.p  pThere are four mathematical ways to arrange them with an operator in between. For my example I will use the division operator but the operators could be anything. p  pABCDp  pABCDp  pABCDp  pABCDp  pABCDp  pIf the numbers were 1,2,3,4 the results would be .0416, .375, .375, 6, .666 respectively. p  pSo if the string was p  pSo if I was to replace A,B,C, and D with any numbers and the division operator with any operators how can I parse it so it gives me the correct result  p  pThe way I did it was using a switch statement and having the case be which operator is at certain String indexes and that works but only for the first one where parentheses dont really matter. I could create 5 different parse methods for each of the five different combinations but it seems like there would be a much better way and it seems like that my way would get extremely clunky because I would have to use nested switch statements.  p  pFor example if the string is p  p012345678910p  pABCDp  pI would apply a switch statement for char at 5. Then do the operation with B and C and store that variable into lets say X.Then a switch statement at char 8, apply to D, store in Y, switch at 1, apply, print result. Then repeat those 40ish lines of codes 5 times changing some stuff around. p  pIs that the best way or is there a better way p  pThanksp

Negative 13591 pIm reasonably new to google analytics. The site I am trying to analyse though is very big and has a lot of dynamic content.p  pTo try and make my job easier Ive made a filter to mash all the times users viewed their own profiles into one number rather than counting each one seperately. The trouble is...I cant check if Ive done this filter right as it is working as a new copy of the analytics for my  page, it didnt take the old data with it and I will have to wait until tomorrow for it to fill with a dayss worth of data.p  pWhat I wonder is, is the anyway to make filters that take preexisting data with them and merely change it Or are filters doomed purely to filter incoming data and what has gone before is untouchablep

Negative 13591 pI have to create an iOS app, which needs to know a referral code right after the installation. The code comes from an email or from a link in the browser.

Ive got an email containing an invite to some app, clicked on the link, and because I did not have TestFlight installed on that device so far, it brought me to the App Store, where I clicked install. The device installed TestFlight app. After this Ive clicked the Open button in the Store, which immediately showed the invite for me.p  pI think the solution cant be that it recognized me, and picket up the invite from the server based on my user account, because I might have multiple invites, so it had to know which exact one to show.p  pEDIT Video of this happening a hrefhttpgk.lka.huxtf.mov relnofollowhttpgk.lka.huxtf.movap  pSo the question is How can I transfer information into an app which is being installed after a link is clicked without reclicking the linkp
Negative 13591 pI am working on an M2M application where data volume is strictly limited and the mobile client has to set up at TLS connection frequently. Is there a standard way  or best practice  for the client to cache the server certificate chain such that the server does not need to send the entire chain on each connection setup I can think of a server that does not send along the optional certificate chain. The client proceeds as usual if it holds the chain in its local cache. But then, once the server certificates expire, the client must somehow tell the server that it has to send along the new chain.p  pIs there a possibility to configure popular TLS implementations in apache or ngix in the way described abovep  pThanks very much for your help Ulip

Negative 13591 pIve been recently assigned on a project using Teradata. Ive been told to strictly use DROPCREATE instead of DELETE ALL, because the latter leaves some space allocated someway. This is counterintuitive to me, and I think its probably wrong. I searched the web for a comparison between the two methods, but I found nothing. This only reinforces my belief that DELETE ALL doesnt suffer from the issue above. However, if this is the case, I must prove it both practically and theoretically.p  pSo, my question is is there a difference in space allocation between the two methods If not, is there an official document user guide, technical specification, whatever else that proves itp  pThank youp

Negative 13591 pIm using some generators to build a processing pipeline in Python. However, I noticed that after several processing steps, I need a value that was computed previously in a previous generator. As an examplep  precodefrom itertools import izip, tee   first generator def gen     for i in range10         yield i  second generator that uses gens values def gen2x     for i in x         yield i2   third generator that requires values from gen and gen2 def gen3iter, iter2     for iter1, iter2 in izipiter, iter2         yield iter1iter2 codepre  pI would use it like thisp  precodex, x2  teegen y  gen2x z  gen3x2, y  nextz codepre  pThere are a couple of issues, though. p  ol lipI need to create a copy of codegencodes values because the second generator consumes the values that also need to be used by codegen3code. pli lipIt is a bit awkward to try to obtain previous values in a pipeline. It doesnt seem to be something that generators are suitable for. pli ol  pThe pipeline I have requires previous values only once, so Im a bit hesitant to use OOP for this situation. I cant really use a list instead of a generator in most steps, because memory consumption would be too high. What is a good way to address this issuep
Negative 13591 pIs it possible to add the On and Off methods to jQuery 1.4.3 version without causing any side effects.

Negative 13591 pin my model on opinon exchange I created one table that stores initialopinions of each turtle for all patchclusters in the model.

Negative 13591 pIm trying to read files data with FileReader API, and I read so many questions with this same problem and tried to implement their solutions, but for some bug in my code maybe, it keep doing wrong result. To avoid crashing the browser when the file is too large more than 15MB I decided to start using the slice method. But the problem is that as the FileReader onload event is async, I get at the part of the code where it should have the completed buffer ready to soon, when its still incomplete. And I cant make everything inside the onload event, because it have only part of the total buffer.

How can I process the entire buffer when using the slice method Another secondary question is inside the onload event, I call a synchronous function CryptoJS.AES.encrypt, but as this event is async, I was expecting that the browser wont freeze while processing the buffer into this event. Is there any way that I can implement something to avoid freezing the browser while processing the filep

Negative 13591 pI am trying to build an app supporting user loginlogout.p  pWhen the app launches I check if user is already logged in, and if so, I will directly segue to the main app, which is a tab bar based view and if not, I will go to a login view and then perform a segue to main app after user logs in successfully. These work just fine.p  pThe problem is concerning when user logs out. There are two cases when user logs outp  ol liIf users have already been to the login screen in this times usage of the app, I can directly perform an unwind segue, and shown by the log I added inside deinit, all the view controllers in the main app are released from memory. li liIf users have never been to the login screen which means when they launch the app they are already logged in, so main app shows directly without a login view, here comes the problem If I directly perform a segue to login screen and the user logs in again, another new main app will be created. Since the old main app views are not released, the new main app view actually doubles the memory. So how can I properly release all the existing main app view controllers after user logs out in this caseli ol
Negative 13591 pIve taken a stab at building an Ember CLI addon to share with the world. The purpose of the addon is a Firebase Authenticator for Ember Simple Auth. Ive gotten the code working, but after packaging it up as an addon according to the Ember CLI documentation as well as a few tutorials, Im running into some issues.p  pFirst, when I install the addon directly from a repo or from NPM, I get the following outputp  precodejamesdixon ember install emberclisimpleauthfirebase version 0.2.3 Installed packages for tooling via npm. installing Installing browser packages via Bower...   cached gitgithub.comsimplabsembersimpleauth   component.git0.7.3   cached gitgithub.comfirebasefirebasebower.git2.2.3 Installed browser packages via Bower. installing The ember generate command requires an entity name to be specified. For more details, use ember help. codepre  pAfter the install, when looking at my application directory, I see that my addon has been installed under codenpmmodulescode and that the proper Bower packages have been installed under the codebowercomponentscode directory. Unfortunately, none of the code under the codeappcode directory of my addon has been merged into the codeappcode directory of the project as is supposed to happen. Ive been through the Ember CLI documentation a number of times in addition to reading through a few tutorials, but no luck. p  pThe full source code can be found here a hrefhttpsgithub.comjamesdixonemberclisimpleauthfirebase relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjamesdixonemberclisimpleauthfirebaseap  pNote that Im running the latest version of Ember and Ember CLI 0.11.1 and 0.2.3, respectively. p  pIf there are any other details you need, please let me know.p  pThanks in advancep  pBest, Jamesp

Negative 13591 pOkay, so I have a huge bunch of text strings around 200300 I will be pasting from a Publisher documents tables into Excel. Many of these strings have statements in them to the effect of em1 fish when you have a net and do fishingem. p  pThe point of this excel sheet is to be a form, where the user will select their desired statements from this list of strings this function is already in place and works well using Data Validation and INDIRECT referring to a VLOOKUP table. However, the sheet then needs to be able to count the various 1s in these statements, sum them together, and present that as data.p  pemi.e. The user selects statements 11, 22, 33, 101, 188, 200. These state in their strings that they add 6 fish, 5 apples, and 1 melon to various totals. The excel sheet needs to present to the user that their fish is now 6, their apples is now 5, and their melons is 1 as a result of those choices.emp  pTo complicate proceedings, when certain choices are made, some of those 1s also need to be multiplied by 2 to become 2s. p  pHence, the sheet needs to be able to analyse these strings, make changes to them as needed like the x2 noted above, and then sum the results.p  pstrongSo as for the actual questionsstrong strongFirst of all, is there a quick way to convert my mass of strings into formulastrong In other words, I simply want to append an equals sign and  as a wrapper of sorts. Find and Replace doesnt seem to work since each string will be different. p  pI tried something like strongFindstrong  strongReplace withstrong , but you just end up with alot of stars in strings that way. I feel like this idea was close and Im just being dumb about something though.p  pI also thought about CONCATENATE, but that appears to only support mashing strings together, not making them into formula. I cant do say CONCATENATE,A3,, it just throws an error.p  pIt may just be that I have to manually do it, and if so, so be it, but Id naturally rather have a quick way to process all these strings.p  pstrongSecondly, once they are formula, how do I count the 1s in these statements, ignoring the text around themstrong I thought about a COUNTIF function, which works fine in another part of the sheet, but here may not be useful. It might well recognise that a statement contains fish and be able to add 1 as a result, but sometimes I want it to add 1, sometimes 2 and sometimes even subtract or multiply the fish total. It cant see the context, in other words. p  pAgain, I can manually look at each statement, and then in the cell after write 2 fish or something, and have the sheet count this if the statement is chosen checking that using a flag. p  pi.e. My data table at the moment will be something like thisp  precodeSTATEMENT                                      FISH  APPLES  TOOLS 1 fish when you have a net and do fishing   1    0      Net 1 apples when you sit by a tree.            0    1      NA x2 fish whenever you would get a fish        0    0      NA codepre  pThis is what Im probably going to do as its easy to understand and not a horrendous amount of extra work, but I want to know if, again, there is a more intelligent way. Bonus points if it doesnt use VBA but if does thats fine too.p

Negative 13591 pId like to create a relationship for Django ORM in which I can add objects from a Set, with data associated in that relationship, but only add each item once to any given container. I mean to use the term Set, defined as followsp  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSet28mathematics29 relnofollowA set is a well defined collection of distinct objects.ap  pEach item in the set, strongSetItemstrong, is unique within the set. I am ensuring that they are unique in this case by having its fields defined with the codeuniqueTruecode kwarg at the class definition.

Negative 13591 pI have a web application which provides a dashboardtype display to users on our local network. It gives status updates on a number of different processes and systems via AJAX polling of the server. Were getting to the point where the load on the server is getting to be too much its old hardware with insufficient memory. We will be upgrading within the next couple of months, but Im considering switching from polling the server to websockets and pushing events to the clients.p  pGiven that the number of requests to the server is going to be drastically reduced, since the server will be pushing notifications to the clients, I think the server load should be reduced. Is this correctp  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe application is written in PHP using the a hrefhttplaravel.com relnofollowLaravel frameworka and is running on a set of Docker containers with Apache as the web server using the a hrefhttpsocketo.me relnofollowratcheta library to implement the server side of the websockets. Changing from PHP to another implementation like node is not practical, but changing web servers is possible.p

I looked over everything and it seems to be functional but for some reason whenever I run it, it just gets stuck in an infinite loop and will not cease.  I have looked over this many times and can just not find where this would happen.  Any help with this issue would be greatly appreciatedp  precodeimport java.io.FileInputStream import java.io.IOException import java.util.regex.Pattern       public class Csv       private  FileInputStream fin     private  String line     private  String[] parsedFields       public boolean isEOLchar n          boolean eol          if n  n  n  r              eol  true                   else             eolfalse          return eol           public String getLine              try                      char c             c char fin.read              whileisEOLc                              linec                                 catch IOException e          System.out.printlnInput Error.                return line            public void parseFieldsString s              Pattern CSVLinePattern.compile[]lt,[,],         parsedFieldsCSVLine.splits             public void execute              String fieldgetLine         parseFieldsfield          public void setFinFileInputStream usrFin              finusrFin           public void outputFields              forint i0 iltparsedFields.lengthi                      System.out.printlnparsedFields[i]                    public static void mainString args[]             try             FileInputStream fis            fis  new FileInputStreamtest.txt            Csv test new Csv            test.setFinfis            test.execute            test.outputFields                 catch IOException e          e.printStackTrace             codepre

Negative 13591 pI was trying to describe a set of contours using Fourier Shape Descriptors FSD. Although, the FSDs seem to not be able to describe the type of contours I have at hand, which have a lot of nonsmooth segments example shown belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSYQuI.png altContourp  pSo, my idea to be able to apply the FSDs to the contours, was to first smooth them in order to eliminate the sharp edges. Although, I have been unable to find an algorithm fit for closed curve smoothing, and was looking for suggestions.p

Negative 13591 pI have been using promises for a while, but now and then I stumble into problems that I cannot seem to resolve no pun intended. p  pI have an array of files for which I have to perform asynchronous functions call for each file to fetch some metadata. p  pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.comtildeiorsvp.js relnofollowcodeRSVP.hashcodea and pass an array of promises returned by a function that load some metadata and adds it as a properties to the file. My problem is that the promise returned by the codehashcode function is resolved before any of the passed promises are resolved, and thus, it enters the codethencode function all too soon.p  pIve created a a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.net76pmttfj relnofollowJSfiddlea that illustrates my problem. Ive explored the possibility that this is not due to RSVP, but instead of how the JavaScript interpreter reads the code, and perhaps does an immediate evaluation of the part I thought would run last.p  pAm I using codeRSVP.hashcode the wrong way, missing something, or have any other errors in my code that would cause it to behave this way instead of what my intentions arep  pThe below code snippet is the same as the JSFiddle.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodefunction checkFileStatusitem    return new RSVP.Promisefunctionresolve, reject      setTimeoutfunction        list.appendltligtChecking status for   item.title       resolve     , 1000      function init    var fileList  [     title First object   ,      title Second object   ,      title Third object   ]    var statusCheck  fileList.mapfunctionitem      return checkFileStatusitem       var promises       promisesCheckFileStatus statusCheck       RSVP.hashpromises.thenfunction      list.appendltligtThis should happen last        initcodepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.9.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srccdn.jsdelivr.netrsvp3.0.6rsvp.jsgtltscriptgt ltdivgt   ltul idlistgtltulgt ltdivgtcodepre div div p
Negative 13591 pI am trying to write a small javascript function which takes data from OpenSignal and then displays it in an html table.p  pThis worked fine up until the point where I tried to make it user friendly by adding in an html form to accept the postcodes input.  I tried to avoid using PHP to do this as my client wont have this installed.  p  pI am adding an event listener to the submit button to detect when the form data has been submitted.  I am then taking this and validating the string contains valid postcodes.  If theyre invalid the program spits out an alert which says Sorry but you seem to have entered an incorrect postcode..  p  pIf not then I am taking the postcodes and passing them into my function processPostcodesOnServer.  The thing is that this doesnt work inside the event listener.  When I pass postcodes in manually using javascript arrays and call the function outside of the event listener everything works fine.  When I put it in the event listener it simply doesnt work.  I have checked all the inputs to the function are correct and have stepped through the whole program numerous times and cannot find out what is causing the problem.  It seems to me this is just another case of Javascripts random behaviour.p  pCan anyone help This is my HTML and Javascript files I am using some JQuery so you will have to link with the latest version if you want to run this.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtMobile Signalslttitlegt ltscript srcjquery1.11.3.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcNetworkStats.jsgtltscriptgt

Negative 13591 pSo Ive made a typical Bootstrap navbar and it works well on Desktop sizes. By default, when I added my logo wrapped with the navbarbrand class as in their documentation example, the logo overhangs off the navbar. I solved this problem by adding padding to the links themselves. This works fine until I resize the browser to act like a mobile device. When it collapses, the navbars height decreases to fit the toggle switch and the logo again overhangs. How to I fix this Did I go about making the height of the navbar the right way by adding padding Or should I make it a fixed height by specifically assigning it p  pThe logo is 55px tall by 128px wide.p  pHeres my HTMLp  precode    ltnav idLCnavbar classnavbar navbardefault navbarfixedtopgt         ltdiv classcontainerfluidgt             ltdiv idLCnavbarheader classnavbarheadergt                 ltbutton typebutton classnavbartoggle collapsed datatogglecollapse datatargetLCnavbarcollapsegt                     ltspan classsronlygtToggle navigationltspangt                     ltspan classiconbargtltspangt                     ltspan classiconbargtltspangt                     ltspan classiconbargtltspangt                 ltbuttongt                  lta idLCnavbarbrand classnavbarbrand imgresponsive href..gt                     ltimg classimgresponsive src..assetsimglogohorizontal.pnggt                 ltagt             ltdivgt              ltdiv idLCnavbarcollapse classcollapse navbarcollapsegt                 ltul idLCnavbarlinks classnav navbarnav navbarrightgt                     ltligtlta href..gtHomeltagtltligt                     ltli classactivegtlta href..shopgtShopltagtltligt                     ltligtlta href..teamgtOur Teamltagtltligt                     ltligtlta href..aboutgtAbout Usltagtltligt                     ltligtlta href..contactgtContact Usltagtltligt                 ltulgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltnavgt codepre  pAnd CSSp  precodeLCnavbar      backgroundcolor 202020     border none  .navbarbrand      paddingleft 30px  LCnavbarlinks      paddingright 20px  LCnavbarlinks li      padding 16px 10px  LCnavbarlinks a      fontsize 16px     fontweight 300     texttransform uppercase     color c0c0c0     webkittransition color 0.25s     moztransition color 0.25s     otransition color 0.25s     transition color 0.25s  LCnavbarlinks ahover      color BE1E2D  LCnavbarlinks .active gt a      color BE1E2D     background none  LCnavbarlinks .active gt ahover      color BE1E2D     background none  codepre  pHow would I go about changing styles to the navbar when its collapsed Obviously to change the overhang problem but also if say I want it to have a different background color when collapsed vs when openp

The Person object is also maintained inside the controller so i dont have to maintain the reference to the same object as the object is directly attached to the cart. I can simpply do codescope.person  codebrbr 2. Second Example The ajax state is maintained by the service which now exposes the person object as well as the functions used to manipulate the object. Now i need to maintain the reference to object bby using functions sucn as codeangular.extendcode and codeangular.copycode. Now the ajax state exposed by a controller is divided over multiple services. Advantages are modularity of the code and almost complete logic less controller.p

Negative 13591 pFirst, the fiddlep  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netbsdvc4km1 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.netbsdvc4km1ap  pIm having trouble aligning an inner div to take up the rest of the height of a container. As you can see in the fiddle, the div whole has a header attached to it, and underneath is a content div. This whole div is overflowing the content div with height 100, instead of grabbing the height of its parent content, it grabs the height of the entire viewport. p  precodeltdiv classwholegt      ltdiv classleftgt      ltdivgt      ltdiv classrightgt      ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThis container should properly be fitting insidep  precodeltdiv classcontentgt     ltdiv classwholegt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe reason there are essentially two divs, chrome and content, to hold the left and right divs is that this is for a react app and chrome is a div wrapper around what another component returns.p  pIf I add an overflowhidden to the chrome div, it appears to solve my problem. However, because the heights are still too tall, but merely invisible, the right div, which contains a bunch of assets intended to be scrolled through, breaks as you reach the end of the div with the scroll bar but its cut off. p  pExample of this a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netgy1kpxwk3 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.netgy1kpxwk3ap  pSo, basically Im asking does anyone know how to make it so the whole div does not break out of its parent, the content div, and properly fills the rest of the space not taken up by the headerp  ptldr make container properly fill rest of parent container, and not break an overflowy scrollp
Negative 13591 pI tried using some ObjectiveC code in a Swift project but ended up deleting said code and the bridgingheader when I found an alternate way to achieve result. Everything seems to work fine i.e. running build, existing outlets in IB connecting etc apart from when I try to create new outlet connections by dragging from IB using Assistant Editor to .swift files. I figure this has something to do with deleting my bridging header but Im not sure what. Ive tried running Clean and also restarting computer, no luck.p  pEDIT Should mention the problem isnt inability to drag, its that Xcode crashes after typing name for outlet and hitting enter.p  pEDIT 2 Heres the error output from Xcode upon crashingp  precodeException Codes       0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000  Application Specific Information ProductBuildVersion 6D2105 UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION NSInvalidArgumentException [IDESwiftSourceCodeGenerator     isTeardownCounterpart] unrecognized selector sent to class 0x112de75c0 UserInfo null Hints None Backtrace   0  0x00007fff94e37024 exceptionPreprocess in CoreFoundation   1  0x00000001011d9bb4 DVTFailureHintExceptionPreprocessor in DVTFoundation   2  0x00007fff9212776e objcexceptionthrow in libobjc.A.dylib   3  0x00007fff94e39fad [NSObjectNSObject doesNotRecognizeSelector] in CoreFoundation   4  0x00007fff94d7fe24 forwarding in CoreFoundation   5  0x00007fff94d7f998 CFforwardingprep0 in CoreFoundation   6  0x0000000112d30532 91[IDESwiftSourceCodeGenerator prepareToAddPropertyWithNametypeinClassItemoptionserror]blockinvoke2 in IDELanguageSupportUI   7  0x000000010266ceb4 [IDESourceCodeGenerator prepareToAddSourceCodeForCounterpartsdocumentLocationForCounterpartBlockaddSourceCodeForCounterpartBlockoptionserror] in IDEKit   8  0x0000000112d3013f [IDESwiftSourceCodeGenerator prepareToAddPropertyWithNametypeinClassItemoptionserror] in IDELanguageSupportUI   9  0x0000000112d0b69b [IDEIBSwiftOutletSourceCodeConnectionContext prepareToInsertSourceCode] in IDELanguageSupportUI  10  0x000000010c3f0a86 [IBSourceCodeConnectionEndPointHandler insertOrPrepareToInsertSourceCodeForConnectionContextprepareOrInsertBlock] in IDEInterfaceBuilderKit  11  0x000000010c3f0eda [IBSourceCodeConnectionEndPointHandler insertCodeForConnectionContext] in IDEInterfaceBuilderKit  12  0x000000010c3f1bbd [IBSourceCodeConnectionEndPointHandler configuredAndCompletedConnectionWithSourceObject] in IDEInterfaceBuilderKit  13  0x000000010c184b1b [IBConnectionManager beginOldSchoolConnectingFromObjectwithEventinWindowusingSourceLocator] in IDEInterfaceBuilderKit  14  0x000000010c184e74 [IBConnectionManager beginOldSchoolConnectingFromEditorCanvasFrameControllerinitialEndPointwithEvent] in IDEInterfaceBuilderKit  15  0x000000010c270bf5 [IBEditorCanvasFrameController sendEvent] in IDEInterfaceBuilderKit  16  0x000000010c497689 [IBViewEditorCanvasFrameController sendEvent] in IDEInterfaceBuilderKit  17  0x000000010c25fe85 [IBEditorCanvasFrame mouseDragged] in IDEInterfaceBuilderKit  18  0x00007fff8f0cbf12 [NSWindow reallySendEventisDelayedEvent] in AppKit  19  0x00007fff8ea5dd76 [NSWindow sendEvent] in AppKit  20  0x00000001024a7168 [IDEWorkspaceWindow sendEvent] in IDEKit  21  0x00007fff8ea5a312 [NSApplication sendEvent] in AppKit  22  0x0000000102250c14 [IDEApplication sendEvent] in IDEKit  23  0x00007fff8e983c68 [NSApplication run] in AppKit  24  0x00007fff8e900354 NSApplicationMain in AppKit  25  0x00007fff939b25c9 start in libdyld.dylib  abort called  Application Specific Signatures NSInvalidArgumentException codepre

Negative 13591 pI am using RequireJS to load stylesheets in an SPA, and then applying the stylesheets dynamically to whatever view the user sees. I am pretty much a web newb and I dont know if it makes sense to dynamically both add and remove stylesheets depending on the view, or should I just add all stylesheets to the document when the application starts upp  pI assume in some cases, stylesheets might overlap, i.e. applying different parameters to the same .classes, etc. So surely in some cases it makes sense to remove a stylesheet from the document and add another.p  pSince this is an SPA, it should be the same document object throughout the application lifecycle, so I cant depend on a page reload to remove stylesheets  I will have to add and remove them explicitly.p  pSecondly, if I have loaded a CSS file with the RequireCSS plugin like sop  precodedefine[cssmystylesheetpath],functionsss   how do I apply the stylesheet sss to the document  ltltltlt   codepre  pI hope this question makes sense.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comguybedfordrequirecss relnofollowhttpsgithub.comguybedfordrequirecssap

But the restriction is that, I must select a datein the datepicker  which is only in the database and display this validated date in an alert.

Negative 13591 pI am building a Win7810 x64 Direct3D11 desktop application that allows the user to switch between windowed and fullscreen mode proper dedicated fullscreen mode, not just a maximized window. On a dualmonitor setup I am encountering some issues.p  pThe switch itself is performed manually using codeIDXGISwapChainSetFullscreenStatecode and works as intended The monitor that houses the lions share of the window area lets call it monitor A goes into dedicated fullscreen mode while leaving the other monitor B as it was, allowing the user to interact normally with windows on B as well as the fullscreen application on A.p  pHowever, if a window on B is dragged or resized so that it crosses over to A, the applications fullscreen state gets disturbed Sometimes it just reverts back to windowed mode leaving the applications internal tracking variable out of sync, sometimes it stays in a quasi fullscreen mode where it seemingly refuses further mode switches, and so on. The same thing happens if a window that overlapped both A and B before the application went into fullscreen mode gets focus.p  pstrongIs there any way to prevent thisstrongp  pI wish the OS would honor my applications dedicated fullscreen mode and keep it in a robust state even if other windows are dragged onto that monitor. Id want the behavior to be similar to having an alwaysontop, maximized borderless window in its stead, i.e. have other windows just disappear behind it and not affect the state of my fullscreen window at all.p  pI have tried some workarounds, like responding to codeWMKILLFOCUScode and temporarily switching my application into a maximixed borderless window until it receives codeWMSETFOCUScode again, but the codeWMKILLFOCUScode message has a lag during which there is time for a user to drag another window into the area that is then still in fullscreen mode, thereby setting me back to square one.p  hr  pThe reason I want this feature rather than simply using a maximized borderless window which is also a supported mode, btw has to do with it allowing for much lower mousemovementtorendering latency, vsync control ONOFF etc.. all of which are  in short  important to the nature of this application which is not a game.p

Negative 13591 pSo this is somewhat of a math problem that Id like to solve using JavaScript. Im creating a fixed canvas on a website that outputs a different image based on every X amount of pixels scrolled from a particular .offset.top from the top of the window. I could explicitly map a new image to a particular position but Ive got a lot of images and it would behoove me to create a function that can handle this process multiple times until particular end point. Im sort of stuck on how to express this and was wondering if anyone could steer me in the right direction.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAfter consider Richard Hamilton answer below Ive been able to somewhat successfully implement his solution to my own project. Its a little verbose, but heres what I have... p  precode Preload Images var totalImages  203 var images  new Array for var i  1 i lt totalImages i       var filename  img     if i lt 10 filename  00     if i gt 9 ampamp i lt 100 filename  0     filename  i  .jpg      var img  new Image     img.src  imagestemp  filename      images.pushimg     Set initial frame index var currentLocation  0   Canvas Context var canv  document.getElementByIdcanvas var context  canv.getContext2d canv     .width768     .height432   Frame Starting Location var currentLocation  0   Determin the breakpoint increment to fit inside the context var contextHeight  .aboutcontext.height  200 var frameHeight  contextHeight  totalImages   Set first breakpoint var breakpoint  63   Get top of context in relation to window var contextPos  .aboutcontext.offset.top  window.scrollTop   Set where to start scrubbing through frames var scrubStart  62   Initial scroll direction var lastScrollTop  0,     st,     direction   Output the scroll direction as up or down function detectDirection       st  window.pageYOffset     if st gt lastScrollTop          direction  down      else          direction  up          lastScrollTop  st     return direction    window.addEventListenerscroll, function       var dir  detectDirection      var contextPos  .aboutcontext.offset.top  window.scrollTop     var contextHeight  .aboutcontext.height     var frameHeight  contextHeight  totalImages      if contextPos lt breakpoint ampamp dir  down          breakpoint  frameHeight         currentLocation         context.drawImageimages[currentLocation], 0, 0, 768, 432         console.logBreakpoint    breakpoint  , index    currentLocation          if contextPos gt breakpoint ampamp dir  up          breakpoint  frameHeight         currentLocation         context.drawImageimages[currentLocation], 0, 0, 768, 432         console.logBreakpoint    breakpoint  , index    currentLocation        codepre  pThis mostly works, but there seems to be a discrepancy between how the frames change during scroll between a mouse wheel and a trackpad. The trackpad is much more sensitive and can get the breakpoint increment correctly, but the mouse wheel ends up scrolling through the section much quicker without correctly keeping up with the proper frame rate, so I never end up reach the final frame by the end of the section.
