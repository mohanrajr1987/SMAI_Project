Positive 2095 pIve tried to solve the problem below for a coding challenge but could not finish it in 1 hour. I have an idea on how the algorithm works but Im not quite sure how to best implement it. I have my code and problem below.p  precodeThe first 12 digits of pi are 314159265358.  We can make these digits into an expression evaluating to 27182 first 5 digits of e as follows  3141  5  9  26  5  3  5  8  27182 or 3  1  415  92  65358  27182  Notice that the order of the input digits is not changed. Operators ,,, or  are simply inserted to create the expression.  Write a function to take a list of numbers and a target, and return all the ways that those numbers can be formed into expressions evaluating to the target  For example f314159265358, 27182 should print  3  1  415  92  65358  27182 3  1  4  159  26535  8  27182 3  1  4  159  26535  8  27182 3  14  15  9  26535  8  27182 3141  5  9  26  5  3  5  8  27182 codepre  pThis problem is difficult since you can have any combination of numbers and you dont consider one number at a time.

Negative 2095 pI am trying to implement some sort of MVC in Java. Actually its more of a MVP but this doesnt really matter to my problem.p  pFollowing situation Ive got a GUI, made with Netbeans because of the better GUIeditor which is updated and changed frequently.p  pAs my main project is easier to maintain in Eclipse I chose to import the Netbeans project into Eclipse as a separate project. So here I am with a project codeAppcode containing the controller and the model package and a project codeGUIcode containing the view package. The problem is that the pattern I am following along has a cyclic dependecy between the view and the controller. Whenever the view changes, the controller gets notified decides which data to get from the model and then makes the changes to the view.p  pWhen I add codeAppcode to the build path of codeGUIcode and the other way round, I will end up with this error message A cycle was detected in the build path of project GUI. emI mean thats true, this cycle is already in my design.em p  pCurrently at startup I register a view to its controller in the following way this is no real code, I am trying to shorten itp  precodepackage view import controller. class viewA    ...    public viewA         controllerA.registerthis        ...     package controller import view. class controllerA implements SomeListener    ...    protected viewA[] registeredViews    public static registerviewA interestedView        arrayPushregisteredViews,interestedView        interestedView.addSomeListenerthis            ...  codepre  pSo you see the connection is made by passing a reference to the controller and then registering a listener onto this view. The problem is if I dont have the codeGUIcode project in codeAppcodes buildpath the import cant be resolved, same happens for not having codeAppcode in codeGUIcodes build path.p  pId like to keep this project structure and also stick to my MVC architecture. How can I work around it What are your suggestionsp

Negative 2095 pI have a Windows Service that takes the name of a bunch of files and do operations on them zipunzip, updating db etc. The operations can take time depending on size and number of files sent to the service.p  p1 The module that is sending a request to this service waits until the files are processed. I want to know if there is a way to provide a callback in the service that will notify the calling module when it is finished processing the files. Please note that multiple modules can call the service at a time to process files so the service will need to provide some kind of a TaskId I guess.p  p2 If a service method is called and is running and another call is made to the same service, then how will that call be processedI think there is only one thread asociated with the service. I have seen that when the service is taking time in processing a method, the threads associated with the service begin to increase.p

Negative 2095 pWe are currently implementing a new OpenSSO Server. The server is on a different server from the web server and I am having trouble getting authentication to occur on our PHP Web server.p  pThe cookie set with the openSSO Token is called iPlanetDirectoryPro.

I need to read this from webserver.company.com and then send an HTTPRequest to the authserver.company.com to retrieve the attributes for that OpenSSO Token.p  pCurrently my code looks like this but it isnt working, I suspect due to not correctly reading the cookie.p  precodeurl  httpauthServer.company.com8080openssoidentityattributes r  new HttpRequest rgtsetURLurl rgtsetMethodHTTPMETHPOST valarray  array     Host gt authServer.company.com,     ContentType gt applicationxwwwformurlencoded,     Cookie gt iPlanetDirectoryProCOOKIE[iPlanetDirectoryPro]      rgtaddHeadersvalarray vardumpr vardumpvalarray   request  print ltbrgt print ltbgtwhat im saying to the serverltbgt print ltpregt print iPlanetDirectoryPro cookie COOKIE[iPlanetDirectoryPro] print rgtgetRawRequestMessage print ltpregt  print iPlanetDirectoryPro cookie COOKIE[iPlanetDirectoryPro] rgtsend    response  print ltbgtwhat the server is telling meltbgt print ltpregt responsebody  rgtgetResponseBody print responsebody print ltpregt codepre  pAny ideas about this Am I going about this in the wrong wayp  pstrongUpdatestrong  So the bottom line I found was the server simply couldnt read the cookie as it was coming from another server. As a work aronud I implemented a REST API that allows the user to submit a login page from the webserver. Its send to the AuthServer which gives back a response. The response should typically be a token unless its invalid. If its a token, a new cookie is created with the token in it so that applications can then use that token to communicate with the authserver, but the cookie resides under the webservers domainp

Negative 2095 pIve been wondering if it is possible to use an codeIntentServicecode to do some networking while keeping the queue of pending intents prioritized. My goal to be able to download some images in the background, add more if needed send another codeIntentcode and be able to reset the queue if necessary preferably using a specific Intent. That is all possible with an codeIntentServiecode but when I send that stop codeIntentcode it needs to be processed as the next item in the queue, not the last where it is right now.p  pEDITp  pFor those interested I have taken the AOSP code for codeIntentServicecode and modified it to meet my needs. The reason I cannot just subclass IntentHandler is because of the private codeServiceHandlercode class inside of codeIntentHandlercode.p  pInside of the codeServiceHandlercode I have a new methodp  precode public final boolean sendPriorityMessageMessage msg                      int priority  msg.arg2             Log.iGenericList.TAG,recieved message priority priority               ifprioritygtPRIORITYNORMAL                 return sendMessageAtFrontOfQueuemsg             else                 return sendMessagemsg                            codepre  pThis method is called from codeonStartcode instead of just codesendMessagecodep  precode Override     public void onStartIntent intent, int startId          Message msg  mServiceHandler.obtainMessage         msg.arg1  startId         msg.obj  intent         try             msg.arg2  intent.getExtras.getIntKEYPRIORITY         catchException e             msg.arg2  PRIORITYNORMAL                   mServiceHandler.sendPriorityMessagemsg      codepre  pOverall the code is still limited but I am able to fast track some messages to the front of the queue, which is what I was after anyway.p

Im using RSpec by the wayp  pFirstly, how do I test drive the solution I need to mock the filesystem so I can dictate the results of Dir.entries or similar for the test case. I know I could write the contents of the directory in the beforeeach block and then clean up after the test but that feels clumsy. I know how to create a stub for the Dir objects and how to force the results, but how do I get that stubbed object into the controller. I want to use the mocked object during testing and the real thing for production. How do I do thatp  pSecondly, where should I put the code that inspects the file system. Im not really using a database for this since Im building info by looking at the directory. So should there be a model at all Or should I do the heavy lifting in the controllerp  pIm sure Im staring the solution in the face, but any help you can give will help me make my first tentative steps into Rails loveliness.

Negative 2095 pI have added a UIButton to a toolbar that is only accessible via the RootViewController which has a navigation bar and toolbar of my app. When navigating to another view, I hide the UIButton, but when I go back to the initial screen a map view the UIButton remains hidden and I must unhide it. Since it is the RootViewController I am doing this in, viewWillAppear is not called, so I cannot use that method.p  pI am wondering if there is any way the RootViewController knows when a view is being popped off the navigationController stack, if so, how would you suggest I check for this Is there any way you would recommend implementing thisp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2095 pI have a dialog box that appears when the user clicks a macro button.

The problem is that the date entered is static, so if I entered 3311 itll stay that way until someone changes it.  p  pI was wondering if there was some way for that text box to always display the current date unless the user decides to change it for whatever reason.

I have seen some nice web site examples that use a map to allow for a time zone choice, but they take up too much real estate on the page for my app.p  pWhile there are several ways to list timezones other than just by GMT offset, I think that the best way to organize timezones is to use a hierarchical dropdown menu with sub menus. Then I would list by continent, then submenus to list both country and major cities and perhaps cityregion exceptions that dont follow the geographical or daylight savings time rule. i.e Arizona in MST and some cities in Indiana in CST. p  pIncluded in the widget would be the ability to remember the users last 5 choices and present  these at the top of the list. p  pThe widget would also allow the user to type using autosuggest which will consider the user input as a prefix, suffix and at any other location in the query. which in SQL terms is an equivalent to saying WHERE somecolumnname LIKE query. Their typing would present a reduced set of choices making the list to choose from much shorter. i.e. CST would present the several timezones that use CST as their abbreviation, 7 would present a list of cities that had their current timezone set to GMT7, 5.5 would list the country of Inida, etc. p  pIf someone knows of a widget that comes close to matching this, would be curious know where they are getting their timezone and DST data, since there are several sources and the data is always being updated.p
Negative 2095 pIve got a problem with passing tokens in C clientserver application. Could you help me with that please Firstly I describe the situation, secondly I paste some source code, thirdly i will give a link to visual studio solutions.p  pSo the situation is like this ive created multithreaded clientserver tcp chat. Everything is working fine, all users can write message at one time, and all users see everything. p  pThe problem is that i need server to pass token to one user at a time, so only one user can send messages at time, when all other users will be only listening. Token should be passing to users in order of joining server for amount of 10 seconds. p  pExample user A joined server, user B joined server, user C joined server. Server passes token to user A for 10 seconds, and user A can write messages for 10 seconds for example, sending button is disabled by default, and server pass token  true to client. If token is true, sending button is enabled for 10 seconds, and then token is false again. After 10 seconds server pass token to user B, and user B can write messages for 10 seconds etc..

Negative 2095 pThis is not specifically a C question but it is the C version of codeswitchcode that makes me ask the question.p  pWhy do I have to explicitly state that I do not want to fall through from one codecasecode statement to the next instead of instead indicating when I DO want to fall throughp  pIn C, the compiler will not let you fall through from one codecasecode statement to the next unless the codecasecode statement is empty and yet it forces you to put an explicit codebreakcode at the end of every one. The vast majority of codeswitchcode statements that I write have no fall through.p  precodeint x  4 string result  switch x  case 1    result  One    break case 2    result  A couple    break case 3 case 4    result  Three or four    break  case 5    result  Five    Here be an error A common typo for me  default    result  Five or more    break  codepre  pThe above example is contrived to show the possibilities. The number of times I actually fallthrough like between 3 and 4 above is minimal. If I remove the comments from case 5 above, the C compiler will catch it as an error. Why do I have to fix it manually if the compiler knows full well what I am trying to dop  pWouldnt the following be betterp  precodeint x  4 string result  switch x  case 1    result  One case 2    result  A couple case 3    continue    or even goto 4 case 4    result  Three or four  case 5    result  Five    This would not longer be an error Hooray  default    result  Five or more  codepre  pLet me be clear that I am not advocating fallthrough here. There is an implied codebreakcode at the end of every codecasecode statement. The two examples are meant to be functionally equivalent.p  pThe compiler could still yell at me if I forgot the codecontinuecode statement in case 3. This would not happen very often though and I would be happy for the help. In fact, the chance that I just missed filling in the skeleton code is pretty high in this case. Useful. Telling me that I forgot a codebreakcode statement is never helpful. It is just more busywork to keep the compiler happy.p  pIt seems like this is probably just a holdover from C which does allow you to fall through even when you have code in the case statement. Is there a deeper reason that I do not seep  pI was looking at some compiler code just this morning and there were hundreds of codecasecode statements in a codeswitchcode that did nothing but return opcodes. Every one of them had a codebreakcode statement. So much typing and clutter...p  pWhat do people think Why is the second option not a better defaultp

The consensus seems to be that the consuming applications should be modified, but, unfortunately, I dont control these applications.  p  pAs for the answers stating that this is dangerous since the select or exists may be modified independently of the other I completely agree, and that is actually what prompted me to ask this question.p

Negative 2095 pI am creating an application that will make heavy use of Ajax and performance is required. Ive searched the best ways to handle Ajax requests using the Zend Framework, and saw that the most commonly used ways are the Contextswitch andor an Action per Controler to handle Ajax requests. If I were to use the first way I would have to keep a script in the view for each type of format that I could return JSON, XML, etc., and I think its unnecessary, and the second way, I would get an action full of ifelses.p  pI do not see anyone suggesting the creation of a module only for Ajax, this would be a bad practice In my opinion this would make things easier, and the whole code for Ajax would be in one place, I would like to know what you think about it before making a decision, and of course, constructive criticism is welcome.p

Negative 2095 pI have a JPanel that I want circles in to appear as I left click and for them to disappear when I right click. I can make them appear on screen by drawing ellipses by getting the source from the mouse event click.  However when I right click  to make them disappear I am just coloring the circle with the background colour of the JPanel and calling repaint. This I know is wrong as the initial object wasnt drawn using the paint method. Is there a way of doing thisp  pThanksp

Negative 2095 pSay I have an app with the following entities Page lt BookPosition ltlt Book. My apps job is to empower users to mix and match pages in one or more picture books using a GUI on the main thread.p  pNow, two pointsp  ol liWhen a user modifies a book, BookPositions are created and destroyed, but never changed. li liA page can be shared across multiple books.li ol  pLets say I synchronize a bevy of picture books some already exist, some are new on a background thread using a shared PSC, a separate MOC, and watertight thread isolation. Before I start the process, I make sure users cant modify any one tobesynced book until after the MOC on the background thread has invoked [NSManagedObjectContext save] for that book, and correspondingly generated an NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification, which is merged in on the main thread using mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification.p  pMe being naive, I didnt expect this approach would ever cause a merge conflict since  ostensibly  none of the entities in question ever have the potential to change on one thread before a call to mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification can bring both MOCs up to date. However, merge conflicts emwillem occur on the background thread if users make a change on the main thread that mutates the set of BookPositions associated with a Page shared between an alreadysynced book and a tobesynced book.p  pThe takeaway here is that changing adding or removing entities on the many side of a onetomany relationship results in a new version of the object on the one side, even when nothing else on the one side has changed. Everything makes sense so far, and I figured I could resolve the problem by setting a merge policy either NSMergeByPropertyStoreTrumpMergePolicy or NSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicy should work here on the background MOC. Unfortunately and unexpectedly, after setting a merge policy, I wound up with conflicts on the main thread, which is precisely why Im confused.p  pId like to know at what point the data in my persistent store is going out of sync with my MOC on the main thread. Does the discrepancy occur as the background MOC is saving  before it has a chance to post a NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationp  pI seem to be able to resolve the problem by also setting a merge policy on the main MOC, but if possible, Id like to know exactly whats going on here.p

Negative 2095 pIm working on several projects that share the same base. All of them are using Linq2SQL as the ORM, for those unfamiliar with L2S, 1n table realtions are expressed as EntitySet and 11 are expressed as a property public OtherTable PropName getset.p  pWhat Im trying to accomplish is to create one Core project containing models that will be shared across several project. And the projects need to be able to extend those models and create new override properties that will be saved on the db, and the same for methods.p  p All projects use a Repository Pattern to access the db returning IQuerables or a primitive type. And the DataContext is injected by HttpRequest. p  p I think itll be easier to explain by giving examples.

Despite the fact that Im not manually or programmatically scrolling my view, my WebView is being automatically scrolled to after the data inside it loads.p  pIve got a fragment in a viewpager.  When I first load the pager, it works as expected and everything is shown.  But once I flip the page the data loads and the WebView pops up to the top of the page, hiding the views above it, which is undesirable.p  pDoes anyone know how to prevent this from happeningp  pMy layout looks like suchp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltScrollView xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightfillparent     androidbackgroundcolorbackground gt      ltLinearLayout         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidorientationvertical gt          ltTextView             androidididarticletitle             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidlayoutmarginRight10dp             androidlayoutmarginLeft10dp             androidlayoutmarginTop10dp             androidlayoutmarginBottom2dp             androidtextSome Title             androidtextAppearanceandroidattrtextAppearanceLarge             androidtextColorcolorarticletitle             androidtextStylebold gt          ltLinearLayout             androidididLLSeperator             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheight1dp             androidlayoutmarginLeft10dp             androidlayoutmarginRight10dp             androidlayoutmarginTop5dp             androidlayoutmarginBottom5dp             androidbackgroundcolortext             androidorientationhorizontal gt         ltLinearLayoutgt          ltWebView             androidididarticlecontent             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutmarginRight10dp             androidlayoutmarginLeft10dp             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent gt          ltTextView             androidididarticlelink             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidlayoutmarginBottom5dp             androidlayoutmarginTop5dp             androidlayoutmarginRight10dp             androidlayoutmarginLeft10dp             androidtextView Full Article             androidtextColorcolorarticletitle             androidtextStylebold gt     ltLinearLayoutgt  ltScrollViewgt codepre  pIm also not giving focus to anything.

Negative 2095 pI have a parser written in Perl which parses file of fixed length records. Part of the record consists of several strings also fixed length, made of numbers only. Each character in the string is encoded as number, not as ASCII char. I.e., if I have string 12345, its encoded as 01 02 03 04 05 instead of 31 32 33 34 35. p  pI parse the record with unpack, and this particular part is unpacked as codearray  unpack C44, scode. Then I recover needed string with simple join, like codem  join, arraycode. p  pI was wondering if thats an optimal way to decode. Files are quite big, millions of records, and obviously I tried to look if its possible to optimize. Profiler shows that most of the time is spent in parsing the records i.e., reading, writing, and other stuff is not a problem, and in parsing most of the time has been taken by these joins. I remember from other sources that join is quite efficient operation. Any ideas if its possible to speed code more or is it optimal already Perhaps it would be possible to avoid this intermediate array in some clever way, e.g., use packunpack combination insteadp  pstrongEdited code examplestrongp  pThe code which I try to optimise looks like thisp  precode    while readREAD, buf, recl  recl          my s  unpack A24 C44 H8, buf         my msisdn  substr s[0], 0, 11         my address  join, s[4..14]         my imsi  join, s[25..39]         my ts  localtimehexs[45]      codepre

Negative 2095 pIm trying to build a multicolumn layout that is adaptive fluid, elastic, whatever you want to cll it and have built a test document to try the idea out.  p  pI did some calculations to come up with the figures that would allow x number of columns to fit exactly side by side in a page. 2 was easy 50, as was 4 25 and 10 10.  If you take a margin into account to leave a gutter and subtract that then you get the column widths in percentage you need.  p  pAll seemed to be going well, I built the CSS and HTML see below and tried it out in Firefox and it all worked fine.  However, when I tried it out in Opera, Chrome and Safari, I ran into a problem.  The columns didnt seem to add up to 100 total when placed next to each other, they seemed to fall slightly short.  The more columns there were, the worse the problem got.  By 10 columns, the problem was extremely noticeable.  p  pWhy is this happening  Is the Firefox behaviour the correct one, or is whats happening in the other browsers whats meant to be happening  More importantly, how do I work around it to produce a consistent result in all browsers  p  pIve built a JSFiddle of the below code, which is available a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netkZcHz relnofollowherea.

Negative 2095 pI have a functioning authentication, ACL and session management system for my online software application. As this is a paid service on a peruser account basis, I need to ensure that a user account cannot be shared between employees in the same fashion that  PayPal manages business accounts. p  pMy struggle is finding a way to do achieve such functionality that a competent, technical user couldnt circumvent via modifying Javascript or using a client side proxy. p  pCurrently, each company account has a database on my server with a session table that consists of codesessionid PK, sessionuser, sessiondata, clientip, timestampcreatedcode and codetimestampupdatedcode columns. Whenever a user logs in, the codesessionusercode column is updated with their login name. Should another person log into that account on a different machine, the previously accessed account will have the sessionuser column set to codeNULLcode. The result is that no two rows should have the same value for codesessionusercode. Possibly worth noting is that customers do not have administrative access to their database.p  pThe clientside application runs a Javascript function on a timer every 5 seconds which performs an AJAX call to a Zend Controller. This controller checks the codesessionusercode column for the active session via a DB query using codeZendSessiongetIdcode. This method codeechocodes a JSON encoded response with codesuccesscode set to codeTRUEcode if the codesessionidcode has an associated codesessionusercode in the database, or codeFALSEcode if there is no value in the codesessionusercode column. In the event that the method returns codeFALSEcode, the Javascript function proceeds to alert the user that another machine has logged into their account, and then redirects them to the login page. p  pThe problem with this approach is that anyone with experience in Chromes inspector or Mozillas FireBug can remove the Javascript that performs the AJAX call and proceed to use the application on numerous machines. Worse yet, this easy method is only the beginning of vulnerabilities. p  pI have a feeling that I will need to look into Zends plugin architecture, perhaps implementing a check during codepreDispatchcode to ensure that the current codesessionidcode has value set in the corresponding codesessionusercode table. This check would be complimentary to my current structure, as I feel that the majority of my users will not be well versed in basic hacking per se, and will do just find to prevent account sharing. If this serverside check fails, as it occurs when a resource is requested, an error could be thrown and the requested data would not be pushed to the front end e.g. the data for viewing products.p  pDoes this approach seem like it will work, or is there a better way of achieving such functionality Ive read a bunch of SO posts that derail into arguments regarding whether or not it is a good idea to be so cumbersome on the enduser. We have already decided that since revenue is largely based around company accounts purchasing additional user accounts that there is a significant need to prevent any sort of account sharing. Preventing the user from logging into an account with an existing session is something I want to avoid. Believe it or not, I would rather have users be annoyed by being booted out of their active session by another device logging in, as I feel this will encourage additional user licenses to be purchased.p  pPlease feel free to ask if you would like any additional information, or require clarification about anything I described in my post. p

Negative 2095 pIm using Apple LLVM 4.1 within Xcode 4.5 but I saw the same thing in an earlier beta. I have it targeting C11 and am using libc the new, C11 enabled, LLVM version of the std library.p  pIn a debug build, if I try to step over code that calls into a std library function e.g. a stdvector constructor the debugger stops in the std lib implementation and if I try to step out it steps even deeper It can take several sometimes 10 or more stepouts before I get back to my own code and I never wanted to step in in this first place.p  pThere always seems to be a LIBCPPDEBUG macro in view, as well as LIBCPPINLINEVISIBILITY  but these seem to be everywhere so Im not sure its a correlation.

Negative 2095 pI am building a Web2Print website using PHP, MySQL and jQuery.The main concept of the website is the end users can create a HTML template by adding text, images, dragging, resizing etc dynamically and convert it to highres A4 size PDF and then moves to printing.p  pFor example see the link a hrefhttpoptisolbusiness.comfuneralsitesampleindexid255 relnofollowhttpoptisolbusiness.comfuneralsitesampleindexid255a. This is the sample HTML that is to be converted to PDF. The width and height of the webpage HTML is 356x405px the problem is when I convert it to A4 PDFs size 8.5X11.69inches the HTML shows very small in PDF.p  pSo I have to increase the width and height of the HTML to fit the PDF size, while increasing the HTML size to 8.5X11.69in. The content inside the HTML should also increase proportionally ie the text font size, background image, images width and height, top left should also be increased proportionally. The PDF should fit exactly like the HTML. I am using the online API a hrefhttpwww.htmlpdf.com relnofollowhtmlpdf.coma to convert to PDF.p

Negative 2095 pIve got unity3d and vuforia app ported to Eclipse. I have one starting activity and one extended activity which does extend vuforia activity and is set up as MAIN activity in manifest.p  pIve got some app initializing activities like GA tracing session open and checking version of new app by requesting my own server.p  pMy problem is that I cant manage to run these init stuff only once in app life cycle.p  pWhen app starts, it loads first Extended activity which loads vuforia and unity scene while showing splash screen, then when it is ready it goes to startup activity where it show some info to user. User reads it and then by tapping goes again to unity activity to get 3d scene.  I can put this initialization in either Extended activity or to start up activity. Both are valid from functional point of view. But what ever I do when user navigates between start up activity and unity activity previous activity is destroyed and next time onCreate is called when going back to it. It happens in both of them so if I put my initialization to any onCreate of these two it gets called multiple times as user navigates to them. p  pWhat I have tried so far  starting intent as startActivity and startActivityForResult, both behave same.  check manifest for statement not to retain history as i seen on some other smilar quaestions  in manifest I put androidconfigChanges for all possible values to make sure activities are not restarted due to some config changes, didnt help  tried to use onSaveInstanceState and set some simple bolean that init was done already. But onRestoreInstanceState is not called when activity is started again and no bundle is passed to onCreate method either. Save instance did happen I have logs there.p  pAlso when I leave the app by pressing home button or by putting it to background programmatically or leaving to play market and getting back to app from there by pressing back button my app activity remains loaded properly. So it gets destroyed only when I go internally from one of my activities to other by calling startActivity or startactivityForResult. p  pI could imagine that unity activity is memory hungry and previous is lets say destroyed to be freed up but in such case my bundle should be saved and passed to onCreate but it is not.p  pIm puzzled, Ive been trying to figure out how to work around this for hours. I greatly appreciate any help. Thanks guys.p

Negative 2095 pAn architectural question. p  pMy site needs to allow the user to record video and upload it to the site. Ive been poking around a fair bit and it seems I emhaveem to use some kind of media server to achieve this aim. As Im introducing this secondary server into the system I seek to embed the flash app residing on this server into the HTML delivered by the site it occurs to me that this broadens the scope of security a lot. What scares me is attackers trying to embed the flash app themselves or attempting to impersonate clients or anything else I havent thought of yet.p  pI was therefore wondering how people secure their applications with such an architecture. Sure I can do what is suggested a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma130066321143herea, a decent bandaid for now but afaik the domain information can technically be falsified by the client.p  pI could separate out the auth of the site giving me a WebServer, an AuthServer and a MediaServer enabling the MediaServer to separately auth. Getting the user to log into both sites is obviously onerous and passing around the users login creds and securing all connections sounds ugly and averse to best practice.p  pAs far as I can see my best bet is some kind of temporary token that the auth server creates. So the website kicks the auth server after logging in to generate the token which the site can then pass to the media server as part of the flash vars and the MediaServer itself can use to double check against the auth server.p  pIm relatively new to Red5, Flash and web security so I was wondering if the following sounds sane, secure andor necessary. Also if anyone knows of decent tools to use for such an auth system and whether there is something already kicking about in ASP.NET auth for such a purpose.p

But I was expecting that if the cube was already animating under one animation adding another would cause it to flicker about as the same properties are being animated by multiple animation calls. but this is not what happens the last animation is halted and the new one takes over, even though my callback function at the end shows that the old animation function was still running So why does the cube not flicker about when multiple clicks are sentp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtTest Pagelttitlegt     ltscript srcthreemini.jsgtltscriptgt     ltstylegt                       margin 0             padding 0             overflow hidden              ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltscriptgt         var animate  functionobj, prop, targetValue, length, callback               var startTime  Date.now, inverseLength  1  length, startValue  obj[prop]              if typeof targetValue  string                  iftargetValue.substring0, 2                        targetValue  obj[prop]  NumbertargetValue.substring2                  else                      targetValue  obj[prop]  NumbertargetValue.substring2                                            var animateProp  function                   var elapsed  Date.now  startTime  inverseLength                  ifelapsed gt 1                       obj[prop]  targetValue                      if callback instanceof Function                          requestAnimationFramecallback                                          return                   else                       obj[prop]  startValue  targetValue  Math.coselapsed  Math.PI  1  0.5  targetValue                      requestAnimationFrameanimateProp                                             requestAnimationFrameanimateProp                   var camera, scene, renderer         var geometry, material, mesh          init          function init              camera  new THREE.PerspectiveCamera75, window.innerWidth  window.innerHeight, 1, 10000             camera.position.z  1000             scene  new THREE.Scene             geometry  new THREE.CubeGeometry200, 200, 200             material  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial                 color  0xff0000,                 wireframe  true                          mesh  new THREE.Meshgeometry, material             scene.addmesh             renderer  new THREE.WebGLRenderer             renderer.setSizewindow.innerWidth, window.innerHeight              document.body.appendChildrenderer.domElement             renderer.domElement.addEventListenerclick, function                  animatemesh.rotation, x,   Math.PI  2  10, 5000, function                      alertCALLED BACK                                  animatemesh.rotation, y,   Math.PI  2  10, 15000, function                                            window.addEventListenerload, render             window.addEventListenerresize, function                  renderer.setSizewindow.innerWidth, window.innerHeight                 camera.aspect  window.innerWidth  window.innerHeight                 camera.updateProjectionMatrix                                function render                note three.js includes requestAnimationFrame shim             requestAnimationFramerender              renderer.renderscene, camera               ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pUPDATE 1p  pIn an attempt to find out whats going on I add more meshes and animated them all differently, the code is below, it animates each mesh for each subsequent click and it animates them first by rotation then it moves them forwards then backwards, then back to rotation. You can animate position without halting the animation on rotation and you can animate one mesh at the same time as another mesh without halting previous animations, so why doesnt the animation flicker when multiple animations are running on the same mesh and on the same propertiesp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtTest Pagelttitlegt     ltscript srcthreemini.jsgtltscriptgt     ltstylegt                       margin 0             padding 0             overflow hidden              ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltscriptgt         var animate  functionobj, prop, targetValue, length, callback               var startTime  Date.now, inverseLength  1  length, startValue  obj[prop]              if typeof targetValue  string                  iftargetValue.substring0, 2                        targetValue  obj[prop]  NumbertargetValue.substring2                  else                      targetValue  obj[prop]  NumbertargetValue.substring2                                            var animateProp  function                   var elapsed  Date.now  startTime  inverseLength                  ifelapsed gt 1                       obj[prop]  targetValue                      if callback instanceof Function                          requestAnimationFramecallback                                          return                   else                       obj[prop]  startValue  targetValue  Math.coselapsed  Math.PI  1  0.5  targetValue                      requestAnimationFrameanimateProp                                             requestAnimationFrameanimateProp                   var camera, scene, renderer, geometry, material, mesh1, mesh2, mesh3, mesh4, mesh5, i  0, j  0          init          function init              camera  new THREE.PerspectiveCamera75, window.innerWidth  window.innerHeight, 1, 10000             camera.position.z  1000             scene  new THREE.Scene             geometry  new THREE.CubeGeometry200, 200, 200             material  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial                 color  0xff0000,                 wireframe  true                          mesh1  new THREE.Meshgeometry, material             scene.addmesh1             mesh2  new THREE.Meshgeometry, material             mesh2.position.x  mesh2.position.y  mesh2.position.z  200             scene.addmesh2             mesh3  new THREE.Meshgeometry, material             mesh3.position.x  mesh3.position.z  200             mesh3.position.y  200             scene.addmesh3             mesh4  new THREE.Meshgeometry, material             mesh4.position.y  mesh4.position.z  200             mesh4.position.x  200             scene.addmesh4             mesh5  new THREE.Meshgeometry, material             mesh5.position.y  mesh5.position.x  200             mesh5.position.z  200             scene.addmesh5             renderer  new THREE.CanvasRenderer             renderer.setSizewindow.innerWidth, window.innerHeight              document.body.appendChildrenderer.domElement             renderer.domElement.addEventListenerclick, function                  var mesh                 ifi  5                      i  0                     j                     ifj  3                          j  0                                                       i                  var mesh  window[mesh  i]                 ifj  1                      animatemesh.position, z,   500, 2000, function                          alertCALLED BACK                                          return                                  ifj  2                      animatemesh.position, z,   500, 3000, function                          alertCALLED BACK                      retunr                                  animatemesh.rotation, x,   Math.PI  2  5, 5000, function                      alertCALLED BACK                                  animatemesh.rotation, y,   Math.PI  2  6, 10000, function                                            window.addEventListenerload, render             window.addEventListenerresize, function                  renderer.setSizewindow.innerWidth, window.innerHeight                 camera.aspect  window.innerWidth  window.innerHeight                 camera.updateProjectionMatrix                                function render                note three.js includes requestAnimationFrame shim             requestAnimationFramerender              renderer.renderscene, camera               ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pcomment for WestLangley let me try and explain a bit more, I apologise for not being clear. lets say I click once and it starts an animation from codeposition.x  0code to codetargetValue 200code. and then halfway through that animation I click again which this time animates in the negative x direction which will start with codeposition.x  100code as its starting halfway through the first animation and has codetargetValue 200code. Now I expect that the first animation is still running so it is continuing to animate from codex100code to codex200code, and the second animation is now also running from codex100code to codex100code, so as each animation function is called I would expect to see the cube jump left and right until the first animation comes to an end and then the second animation can continue unhindered. This is what I was expecting to happen, thus I was expecting it to flicker. But apparently multiple animation functions are running at the same time but only the latest one is having any effect updating the mesh properties. S at least as far as I can tell.p  pMy main worry about this is that I can tell from the experimenting that the hidden animation calls are still being processed and so throwing away precious processor cycles, it also leads to problems with adding animation calls in the callback function. To this end my main concern is how can I stop these hidden animation callsp

Negative 2095 pI am using the CKEditor 3.6.5.7647 on Drupal 7 to turn all my filtered HTML text field into WYSIWYG editors. Drupal does this automatically, but it messes up the form validation. Indeed, drupal still correctly aplies the codeerrorcode class to the textarea, but the textarea is now hidden and replaced by the WYSIWYG editor, preventing the user from seeing the effects of that class red border. I thought this would be easily fixed by adding a script which looks around at all the WYSIWYGs and sets their border red if the associated textarea has the codeerrorcode class set, but Im finding that my script is being executed before the WYSIWYGs are built, breaking it.

I know I must be doing something completely wrong but I cant seem to find any info on the net about how to do this.p  pBasically I just want this to be a standard wpf button but with Century Gothic for the font, Green background when clicked, etc.p  pCould anyone point me in the right directionp  precodeltButton xClassIM.WPF.Controls.imButton         xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation         xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml         xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006         xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008         mcIgnorabled         dDesignHeight23         dDesignWidth75gt    ltButton.Stylegt     ltStyle TargetTypeButton            xNameimButtonStylegt       ltSetter PropertySnapsToDevicePixels               ValueTrue gt       ltSetter PropertyOverridesDefaultStyle               ValueTrue gt       ltSetter PropertyContent               ValueimButton gt       ltSetter PropertyBorderBrush               Value006150 gt       ltSetter PropertyFontFamily               ValueCentury Gothic gt       ltSetter PropertyFontSize               Value12 gt       ltSetter PropertyForeground               Value006150 gt       ltSetter PropertyTemplategt         ltSetter.Valuegt           ltControlTemplate TargetTypeButtongt             ltControlTemplate.Triggersgt               ltTrigger PropertyIsPressed                        ValueTruegt                 ltSetter PropertyBackgroundgt                   ltSetter.Valuegt                     ltLinearGradientBrushgt                       ltGradientStop Color006150                                     Offset0 gt                       ltGradientStop Color006150                                     Offset0.5 gt                       ltGradientStop Color006150                                     Offset0.5 gt                       ltGradientStop Color006150                                     Offset0.9 gt                     ltLinearGradientBrushgt                   ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltSettergt               ltTriggergt             ltControlTemplate.Triggersgt           ltControlTemplategt         ltSetter.Valuegt       ltSettergt     ltStylegt   ltButton.Stylegt    ltButton.Backgroundgt     ltLinearGradientBrush StartPoint0,0                          EndPoint0,1gt       ltGradientStop ColorWhite                     Offset0 gt       ltGradientStop ColorE0E0E0                     Offset0.5 gt       ltGradientStop ColorLightGray                     Offset0.5 gt       ltGradientStop ColorDarkGray                     Offset0.9 gt     ltLinearGradientBrushgt   ltButton.Backgroundgt  ltButtongt codepre  pThanksp

Negative 2095 pMy company maintains a number of large time series databases of process data. We implement a replica of a subset at a pseudocentral location. I access the data from my laptop.

Negative 2095 pIm fairly new to Android development but from what I read I am pretty sure there is no direct API access to the incall audio stream.

IE someone calls, we get the answer, mute the microphone so that he cant hear the environment and pass an alternative audiostreamsome kind of recording to the microphone while it is muted...That was the only workaround I can think of and I have no idea if something like that is possible, but I will appreciate any feedback.

In this demo files, I have strictly the same problem alerting some message at the same point of the main.js delivered with the package, and btw when loading the demo files and when clicking to start the upload of a file, the uploads doesnt process and I am thrown to my onwn local diskdrive directory, which is weird. So if there is someone thah knows about this Jquery Upload plugin, it will be of a great help. I tried to google it but it didnt work at all p
Negative 2095 pCurrently trying to figure out what the issue is with this sort. Built directly from the inplace Quicksort pseudocode from Wikipedia, which I am going to assume is reliable.

Negative 2095 pI have been working on a problem for a while I am a chemical engineer, so it takes me forever to understand how to code something of how to have several tabs operating in their own process, but with each tab having its own data to show in a codematplotlibcode plot. I have been running into many pickling errors and I wondered if anyone had any somewhat simple solutions.  I believe the main reasons for the pickling errors is due to the object I am trying to pass as a property into the tab object.  This object holds some data as well as many other objects which help fit the data it holds.  I feel like these objects are very nice and rather necessary, but I also realize that they are causing the problems with pickling.

Negative 2095 pIm trying to create a prototype to convert a PDF file to an XML file. The result is a little strange, all the characters becomes symbols. I think the bug is where the codeStringBuffercode takes the data from the byte array. Can somebody with Java knowledge please helpp  pThis prototype software is using the codeiTextcode API. To read the PDF file, we have used thecodePDFReadercode class. The data is first converted into a byte array, then with the use of codeStringbuffercode, it will again converted into string. Then we have used codeStreamResultcode wich acts as an holder for the transformed result in XML.p  pAfter that, the codeTransformercode class processes XML from a variety of sources and writes the transformation output to a variety of sinks. Then codeTransformerHandlercode listens for SAX codeContentHandlercode, parse events and transforms them to a result.p  pThe methods codestartElementcode and codeendElementcode of codeTransformerHandlercode class have created the tags in the xml file. The Parser invoked codestartElementcode method at the beginning of every element and codeendElementcode at the end of every element in the XML document.p  precodeimport com.lowagie.text. import com.lowagie.text.pdf. import java.io. import javax.xml.parsers. import javax.xml.transform. import javax.xml.transform.sax. import javax.xml.transform.stream. import org.xml.sax. import org.xml.sax.helpers.  public class Cp2x           static StreamResult streamResult         static TransformerHandler handler         static AttributesImpl atts          public static void mainString[] args throws IOException                   try                          Document document  new Document                         document.open                         PdfReader reader  new PdfReaderChelloworld.pdf                         PdfDictionary page  reader.getPageN1                         PRIndirectReference objectReference  PRIndirectReference page                                         .getPdfName.CONTENTS                         PRStream stream  PRStream PdfReader                                         .getPdfObjectobjectReference                         byte[] streamBytes  PdfReader.getStreamBytesstream                         PRTokeniser tokeniser  new PRTokeniserstreamBytes                          StringBuffer stringbuffer  new StringBuffer                         while tokeniser.nextToken                                  if tokeniser.getTokenType  PRTokeniser.TKSTRING                                          stringbuffer.appendtokeniser.getStringValue                                                                                   String test  stringbuffer.toString                         streamResult  new StreamResulttest.xml                         initXML                         processtest                         closeXML                         document.addnew Paragraph..                         document.close                  catch Exception e                                     public static void initXML throws ParserConfigurationException,                         TransformerConfigurationException, SAXException                  SAXTransformerFactory tf  SAXTransformerFactory SAXTransformerFactory                                 .newInstance                  handler  tf.newTransformerHandler                 Transformer serializer  handler.getTransformer                 serializer.setOutputPropertyOutputKeys.ENCODING, UTF8                 serializer.setOutputProperty                                 httpxml.apache.orgxsltindentamount, 4                 serializer.setOutputPropertyOutputKeys.INDENT, yes                 handler.setResultstreamResult                 handler.startDocument                 atts  new AttributesImpl                 handler.startElement, , Document, atts                   public static void processString s throws SAXException                  String[] elements  s.split                 atts.clear                 handler.startElement, , Note, atts                 handler.characterselements[0].toCharArray, 0, elements[0].length                 handler.endElement, , Note                   public static void closeXML throws SAXException                  handler.endElement, , Document                 handler.endDocument           codepre

Negative 2095 pI have to protect my program, which is written in .NET. Ive decided to use the themida protector to virtualize a small dll written in C, which will be loaded into the main program via PInvoke to activate it.p  pFor some specific reason, I need to have the protection dll compiled with a clr key. Library doesnt export any managed types, so it is possible to use themida there.p  pBut I have some issues with the protected dll. When the dll is compiled with clr support and protected by themida, it is deadlocked in DllMain. It looks like themida puts some managed calls into DllMain in this case. Is there any way to workaround this trouble and prevent the deadlockp

Negative 2095 pI need to call a property like codebean.data1Acode, but where the number in the property name is a variable.

How can I achieve thisp  pI have a bunch of properties likep  precodebean.data1A bean.data2A bean.data3A etc codepre  pBecause I cannot call parameterized methods from a bean because of the old JSP Server I have to use.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong as to the reasoning for this, I have a grid of data 18 or 27 rows and 7 columns that displays data from a bean. In this bean, there is a vector, where each element contains the an object that holds the data for the row a, b, c, d, e, f, amp g for a specific row can be retrieved using one element of the vector.p  pTo use the grid, I can change as many cells as I want and then click an update all button. The reason I want to use n as a variable for the row number is that the number of rows will changed based on the year of the data being shown. Im currently using an n variable to print the correct row number on the row labels for the gridp

Negative 2095 pIm working on comments for posts on my website. How to create a button in javascript that will open iframe window with comments when user clicks on that button Something like Facebook have with their comments on posts. If there is a way to create this with other language I would like that you write it. I just wrote javascript because I heard that you can do that in javascript. If there is a more elegant andor better way feel free to write it. So below every posts I would add a button and when user clicks on it, it should open something like thisp  precodeltiframe srccomment.phppostidltphp echo postid gt      width600px      height500pxgt ltiframegt codepre  pAnd is there a way that iframe window loads only when you click on the button, not in the same time as page on which are posts For example, if I have 10 posts on one page, and comments for all 10 posts are loading at the same time as the page with posts, it would slow down a page a lot.p  pAlso do you know how to adjust iframe window size to amount of posts, so that if a post have 1 comment, window size is 100px, and if a posts have 5 comments, window size is 500pxp  pI know that Facebook have something much better than this for their comments, so if you know something better than my idea, please feel free to share it.p

Negative 2095 pMaybe someone could clarify me, as I am not finding that clearly written in documentation...p  pI do have a single application, which is running on multiple machines. With OAuth2 I do have to obtain an Access Token in order to work with Google API. Do I need to use strongsinglestrong Access Token across all my hosts and take care that it would be synchronized across them which increases the complexity level, as once token expires  it must be refreshed and again distributed across all hosts, or it is possible that each host could get its own token and cache it locally p  pI am not really sure either 2nd option is safe though it would be easier to implement, as documentation writes that token can become invalid once it is refreshed. Could it happen, that while one host is creating its own token all other tokens from other hosts become automatically invalidp

Negative 2095 pRecently, I got into a discussion with an Architect who is known to be a seasoned Architect. The discussion was around an ideal Architecture and design for a multitenant Web Based Application that runs in a Web Farm. The applications only job is to allow users to upload n number of Excel files which are being processed by the System to generate very complex reports. Processing of these files takes a long time  an hour for each, lets take it as a constraint. Hence, users after upload wait for the notification from the System to download the generated reports.p  pAt first glance the requirement looks pretty simple, but the expectation is that the application must be 100 scalable. We discussed on various solutions along with the Architectures but we didnt find it satisfactory. I need members from this community to propose solution with design along with Technologies. This is not my professional assignment but its just a survey to find out Architects view on building scalable applications VS just Cloud ready applications where its easy to scale the infrastructure rather than focusing on applications scalability.p

Negative 2095 pI have been asked to revamp an existing codeJDialogcode that is a child container of an inhouse Swing app. I will be rewriting the dialog from scratch and have been asked to lead the charge towards making the Swing app resemble a true MVCMVP architecture so my codeJDialogcode revamp will be the first of many proMVC changes to the app itself.p  pI understand MVCMVP as it pertains to web appsp  ul liController  is what the web app framework dispatches to handle HTTP requests typically consists of multiple methods, where each controller method handles the request for a slightly different URLli liModel  the DAO or POJObean representing callspecific data controller fetches the Model from the DB and injects it into the Viewli liView  the mechanism that ultimately produces HTMLJSP that will be sent back to the clientrequesterli ul  pThis is not how emallem MVCMVP web frameworks operate, but is the general idea.p  pBut Im struggling trying to determine how to translate this to a Swing app. In the Swing app, you havep  ul liThe codeJDialogcode itselfli liAll the UI widgets codeJButtonscode, codeJTextFieldscode, etc. that make up the view of the dialogli liThe actionevent listeners for all the UI widgets which collectively make up the business logic for how the dialog will operate when the user interacts with the viewli liAll the other UI glue code setting which widgets will be enableddisabled, setting their sizes and positions on screen, setting their tooltip texts, etc.li liPlus a lot of other stuffli ul  pSo I ask how do I organize all the code necessary for a functioning codeJDialogcode using an MVCMVP architectural pattern Also, if there are any articles, tutorials, or existing open souce projects that showcase MVCMVP Swing apps, I am interested in them as well. Thanks in advancep

Negative 2095 pIm trying to add a clause to an existing GORM criteria to do some extra filtering.p  pI have various objects in my domain that are owned by an codeOrganisationcode. For example, codeProductcode. Organisations can also own other organisations. I only want codeUsercodes who belong to a particular codeOrganisationcode to be able to see domain objects that belong to that codeOrganisationcode or any of their codeOrganisationcodes child codeOrganisationcodes.p  pThere are a number of places in my application where I need to query for domain objects that are owned by codeOrganisationcodes. I want to create a codeDetachedCriteriacode instance that I can reuse throughout by application wherever I need to filter out objects that a codeUsercode should not be allowed to see.p  pIve denormalised my model a bit to hopefully make things easier. When a new codeOrganisationcode is inserted, it recursively adds itself to the codehierarchyOrganisationscode collection of each of the codeOrganisationscode above it.p  precodeclass Organisation      ...     static hasMany  [hierarchyOrganisations Organisation]     ...  codepre  pOne of the places I want to apply the organisation filtering codeDetachedCriteriacode is in Grails scaffolding controllers codelistcode method, so I need to be able to paginate the final set of results.p  pUsing the codeProductcode controllers list method as an example, Im currently doing something like this p  precodedef hierarchyCriteria  new DetachedCriteriaOrganisation.build      eqid, currentUserOrganisation.id   def productInstanceList  Product.createCriteria.list      inListparentOrganisation.id, hierarchyCriteria.list.each  organisation gt          organisation.hierarchyOrganisations.collect  it.id        codepre  p...which works, but I dont think it will scale. Ill be hitting the database to bring back the collection of codehierarchyOrganisationscode, then iterating over them in the application to pull out the id, and then querying again to bring back the final filtered list of organisations.p  pIf I was using SQL, I could use a join or an inner select, but I cant seem to get the syntax right translating this to the GORM criteria dsl. p

Negative 2095 pIve implemented GCM in my app and Ive come across a strange issue. When my overriding codeIntentServicecode for codeGCMBaseIntentServicecode sits in my root package it works fine. I reference it in my manifest with code.MyGCMIntentServicecode. The root package would be codecom.example.rootpackagecodep  pWhen I move my intent service to a different package, such as codecom.example.rootpackage.servicecode the intent service is never called. At this point I would update my manifest to point to codecom.example.rootpackage.service.MyGCMIntentServicecode and no dice.p  pAm I missing something in Googles documentation on locating it or is this just how it worksp

Negative 2095 pSo I have a project called strongWingStylestrong a hrefhttpsgithub.comIngwiePhoenixWingStyle relnofollowhttpsgithub.comIngwiePhoenixWingStylea It is yet in development, and i need something to make it a little smarter.p  pIn a way I want to get away from some quotes  take html as example. When the user calls a function which isnt there yet, the framework autoloads the class for that purpose and then runs the function. In the process of autoloading, there is a codeconstructcode method being triggered.p  pLets take the function strongcodecolorcodestrong as example. In the normal case, a user would call it like thisp  precodeltWS...     gtcolorwhite gtendgt codepre  pBut as you may know, we have a set of default colors  white, black, red, orange, etc, etc. Now the problem is that when I try to use the above code WITHOUT quotes, I get the typical codeuse of undefined constantcode error. That is why I coded in a loader function which only triggers the initializing code which then adds the constants needed.p  pAs far as I know, the interpreter sees the undefined constant before executing the code  so of course, I cant trigger the initializing code before the constant comes in...p  pIs there a way in which I can make the interpreter first trigger the initializing code and THEN see the constant I dont mind sticking with my loadmethod really, but it just gets annoying adding things to it. I would really like to know of a way in which I could add the constants on the fly.p  pCheck out the projects source to see what I mean.p  pThe functions and mechanisms in questions are found inp  precodeclassesWingStyleBase.php    addDefs classesWingStyleManager.php    get codepre

Negative 2095 pId like to have a compareTo method that takes a Real a class for working with arbitrarily large and precise real numbers [well, as long as its less than 231 in length at the moment] and a compareTo method that takes an Object, but Java isnt letting me and Im not experienced enough to know why.p  pI just tried to modify the class to implement Comparable and I got these error messages below.

Negative 2095 pFor a game I am writing, the world is saved as chunks. Each chunk when saved is just under 200kb they are very large chunks. Whenever a world is loaded 121 chunks need to be loaded. Each one only takes a fraction of a second, but all those fractions add up and lead to taking several seconds.p  pThis would be ok, but saving is even more important. When a player walks into new chunks, all the chunks out of range will be saved and unloaded. As each save takes a fraction of a second, I would get a lag spike of over a second every time the player moves chunks. For this reason, I hope to use Threads to save and load chunks so that a chunk can be savedloaded while the game is still running.p  pI have no idea how I would implement such a thing though. So, if anyone could share a link to a tutorial or give some source code I could play with, that would be greatp  pThanksp

Negative 2095 pI have a windows form parent that takes a value from textbox and then opens child form which then uses that value to select an image from a directory.  When multiple images are found for the particular value, I have the form modified to display a couple of buttons to navigate Next amp Previous  to display the different images.  Upon first opening the parent form, entering a value and then using form.show to display the child form  everything works as expected.  But if another value is entered into parent form child form can still be open or exited hidden and the  Next button is clicked the code in the click event is running over again for however many number of images are in the ListimagesFound.  Say I have 3 images in the ListimagesFound and I step through the code in debug mode the btnNext  click event fires 3 times in a row.  This of course runs GetMultiImages method which causes sequence of displaying the images to be all of.  And again, this doesnt happen the first time a value is entered into parent form.  Ive made sure the list and other variables are cleared out in GetImage method.

In the setup here, a prompt is shown above a blank line, and in that blank line one is to type the appropriate conjugation. Pressing the Submit button is strongsupposedstrong to check the answers against those of the array, but by my own fault or lack of understanding I see the message FAIL even when directly copying what I know to be the correct answer.

Negative 2095 pIm having this strange phenomenon with an extlib dialog which Ive never encountered before. The scenario is pretty much straightforward theres a link control calling the dialog.show method through its serverside conclick event. As soon as the dialog appears, however, it somehow is emgluedem to the right edge of the browsers window. Dragging the dialog to the left doesnt actually move it but increases its width instead p  pI cant see anything special at all looking at the source code through firebug. AFAIK theres only one thing special about this application the Xpage in question is running inside a classical frameset, due to the fact that this a 10 year old Domino web application, and theres simply no budget to completely transform it to XSP logic, so Im doing it one by one Im asked for some adjustments.p  pUp to now this combination runs just great, no flaws so far until now, and Im not at all sure if the one has something to do with the other.p  pHappens in both Firefox and MSIE. I tried this on servers of version 8.5.3 UP1 as well as 9.0.1. Designer version is 9.0.1.p  pCurrently, I worked around this by adding some right margin to the dialog, so at least it appears somewhere eminsideem the frame from where it is called. But it still is pinned to some right edge.p  pAny hint is more than welcome.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pMeanwhile I tried a tooltip dialog instead of a standard one again the resulting control appears is pinned to the right edge, but it also spans across the entire parent frame. And the tooltip marker that should be pointing to the evoking link also is pointing to the rightmost possible position. So its obviously for me now that those controls dont like to be called in the context of a frameset. Or could that be sop  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pThanks to Patrick and Michael I had a few more ideas what I could try. Its still not working as expected, but at least I can now say for sure that the surrounding frameset strongis notstrong the reason for this all in a blank db with frameset and all the dialog works as expected. Whereas the dialog doesnt work in my project db even if I call the page by its own.br Weirdest thing I just found out is if I run the page in firefox strongANDstrong with the firebug split window open then the dialog behaves just normally as I can drag it around like I want to.p

Negative 2095 pI am trying to create a reliable JMS environment using ActiveMQ. I am planning to go for a JDBC master slave clustering approach in which I can persist the messages received by master server to database and slave server can pick those messages and run them in case the master server dies. But I dont have a solution to the situation in which both the master and slave go downdue to any reason. If that happens, will the messages sent by producer get lost for ever I can do something like persisting messages to database and executing them after one of the JMS servers recover, but is there a betterbuiltin solution to handle such scenarios p
Negative 2095 pI was reading up on Load balancing today. From what i know, Rackspace Load Balancing would handle all data. The question i have with me is, why cant the load balancer just redirect connections Instead , it is handling all the connection, it feels like a bottleneck because One is trying to scale but at the same time it has to go through the load balancer, all the data.p  pI read that , the session would be lost. Is there anyway for it to just redirect only Different server has different IP but public has access to one only ... hmmm , I know that session is store in server... Not DB. p  pSo It just has to be that all data just has to go through Load balancer Its like paying for Outgoing Charges for Server  Load Balancing. Data sort of doubld in size. p

Why is the loop not exiting when codeID.sizecode reaches 10p  pI tested the codeID.sizecode by codecoutcodeing the size after each run of the loop and it does indeed reach size 10 after the 10th valid ID input, but the loop still doesnt end. Whyp  pEdit codeIDcode and codestoredIDcode are both string vectors somewhere else in the function. p
Negative 2095 pIm new to Git, and so far loving what it can do.  I started by making a physical copy of my production server and setting up the staging server, then using any conflicts to determine what to add to the .gitignore. Once that was working I added my first commit and pushed everything to github.  then I set up a blank install for my development server and pulled from github, added the local config and ignored files and then did some testing... and learning along the way.p  pNow I want to get the production server in on the action, but I cant mess up production.  I made a backup of my publichtml dir and then the followingp  precodegit init git add remote origin gitgithub.comltaccountgtltrepogt.git git pull origin master codepre  pThen I had a 500 Server error and quickly restored my publichtml from backup.  What did I do What should I do Any suggestionsp  pBTW I couldnt have gotten this far without Stack  so thanks to all of youp

Negative 2095 pI have created a tabbed android application using android.support.v4.view.PagerAdapter.p  pThere are about seven tabs in the application and I plan to add more. Each tab contains a lot of controls TextView, Spinners, Toggle buttons, Check boxes etc.p  pOn the first tab there is a drop down to select a profile. The user can Load or Save a profile he wants.p  pA profile contains data for all the controls in the tabs and I need to update the UI controls in all the tabs.p  pI have all the data loaded from the profile but the UI controls are not getting updated.p  pThere is a UpdateUI function which calls set functions setText, setChecked etc. for individual controls after finding its view by ID.p  pI was informed that only three tabs Previous, Current and Next are kept in memory so I wrote the application such that the UpdateUI function is called to set UI data only when user swipes to that particular tab figuring out the active fragment.p  pUsing DDMS logs I saw that the data loaded was proper but the setText or setXXXXX function does not update the fragment tab.p  pI have also checked several possible issuesp  ol liPossibility of OnTextChanged or an OnListener updating the data again.li liMade sure UpdateUI is called from UI thread.li liUsing notify data change and redrawing UI to make sure UI is updated.li ol  pI am a novice JavaAndroid programmer.

Negative 2095 pI am working with a custom testing framework and we are trying to expand some of the assert functionality to include a custom error message if the assert fails. The current assert is called like thisp  precodeassertcomparefirstterm, neq, secondterm do   puts foobar end codepre  pand we want something with the functionality ofp  precodeassertcomparefirstterm, neq, secondterm, errormessage do   puts foobar end codepre  pso that if the block fails the error message will describe the failure. I think this is ugly, however, as the framework we are moving away from did this and i have to go through a lot of statements that look likep  precodeassert.comparevariablefoo[ARRAY1][2], variablebar[ARRAY2][2], This assert failed because someone did something unintelligent when writing the test. Probably me, since in am the one writing this really really long error statement on the same line so that you have to spend a quarter of your day scrolling to the side just to read it codepre  pThis type of method call makes it difficult to read, even when using a variable for the error message. I feel like a better way should be possible.p  precodeassertcomparefirstterm, neq, secondterm do   puts foobar end onfail This is a nice error message codepre  pThis, to me, is the best way to do it but i dont know how or if it is even possible to accomplish this in ruby.p  pThe goal here is to make it as aesthetic as possible.

Negative 2095 pIs there a reasonable way to detect Gimbal beacons, when the app is in backgroundbr My current solution is to start the Gimbal service when the app launches and also start the visit manager. That way I receive events each time I get into the area of a beacon even in background.br I believe there must be a more elegant solution because I cannot keep the service always started, searching for visits. Also, I observed that the manager will stop sending callbacks at some point. p  pWhen do you think is better to startstop the service and startstop the visit manager if I always want to be informed about beacons visits background includedp

Negative 2095 pAt my company, I have an excel sheet with around 400 records of our inventory. The spreadsheet has sorting built right into it and gets reordered several times a day. As new inventory is entered in, I want to make a conditional formatting rule that keeps the new rows green for 5 days to let our salespeople know that these entries are new. p  pI have tried conditional formatting rules, but the rules stick to whatever row number that entry was in at the time, and does not stay on the same record when I sort the file. Is there a way to set my conditional formatting rules to hold on to a specific inventory tag numberp  pAlso, it might be worth noting that Im currently the only one still stuck on one of our older computers, so Im using Excel 2003 while everyone else accesses this file using 20072010.p  pThanks in advance for your help Collin Helmersp

Negative 2095 pMy graph contains nodes called points and lines. p  pThere is a relationship type called NEXT, which connects two points and has a property called codelineIDcode a long. A line node consists simply of an ID and a reference to a root point. To traverse a line is to start with its root node and follow the NEXT relationships whose codelineIDcode matches the id of the line being traversed. To clarify, if were traversing a line with ID 123, whose root point has id 321, the Cypher traversal would be p  precode START n  node321   MATCH n[relNEXTlineID123]gtx   RETURN collectrel codepre  pA line, then, is essentially a linked list of Next relationships with matching codelineIDcode properties. That said, I dont want to persist this list as a property of lines  I want the list to be constructed by a traversal when a line is loaded. p  pWhat are my options for implementing this in springdataneo4j Specifically, should lines exist as codeNodeEntitycodes, and if so what should they contain p  precodeNodeEntity class Line      RelatedTotypeROOT     Point root     RelatedToViatypeNEXT      IterableltItemgt list codepre  pdoesnt quite fit, because the emlineem is not related via Next relationships to the item, the root point is. It also fails to address the fact that those NEXT relationships need to have a lineID property matching the lines ID which becomes important because some points exist on multiple lines  i.e. they have multiple NEXT relationships with different lineIDs. I have a hunch that the solution will involve annotating the list as a GraphTraversal, but I dont understand how that would work. p  pIm doing this largely as an exercise to wrap my head around data modeling in SDN, in the context of wrapping my head around Neo4j and graph databases in general. If the question Im asking reveals a flaw in my understanding of any of these things, Id be very appreciative if someone could point it out. p

Negative 2095 pI need to generate SSRS report as shown in the above picture the top portion of the image got cut off but it has the header as shown below which should appear on only at top of each page. p  pHEADER is as belowp  pBin ItemNr  Description QtyOnHandp  pMy data output is as below which I need to use to generate report format as shown above.p  p[enter image description here][2]p  pbIssues I am facingbp  pI used 2 tablix. The first tablix has groupby on ItemNr and I show only if the record has binPriority equal to 0. I then added another tablix within first tablix to findout if the itemNumber count is 1 else I hide this tablix. Here I printed rows where binPriority is lt 0.  p  pI get the data output somewhat similar to what I wanted but the header row appears for every item where binPrority is 0.  I want it to appear only per page. So what I did was I set the row header within first tablix as invisible and added the textboxes within the page header. I guess this is not the way to do it but this is where I am so far.p  pAlso when I export to PDF, I see blank lines between each item See image below.  To me this lines looks like the 2nd tablix which is hidden.

Negative 2095 pI have been struggling with this a while. How could I group data in 7 day intervalsp  pEssentially I am trying to stronggroup by a week that starts on Fridaystrong. Dates are picked at random within periods between a Friday and the next Thursday. Due to human error there may be not exactly the same number of observations in every period, although normally there should be 7. It is possible that a whole period or two might be missing.p  pThe ideal way would seem to determine a period i.e. week beginning on Friday number for each date and then add it to the data set in another column.p  precodegt strdata data.frame   55 obs. of  15 variables    id            num  7 8 9 10 11 12 13 16 17 18 ...    q0001        Factor w 2 levels Yes,No 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 ...   q0002        Factor w 2 levels Yes,No 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...   q0003        Factor w 2 levels Yes,No 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...   q0004        Factor w 2 levels Yes,No 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 ...

We take 7 random observations in periods from Fri to next Thu including. So I need to group the answers to questions i.e. count yes in questions 1 to 4 within these 7 day periods.p  pstrongHow data are producedstrong We are looking at 4 quality parameters in hospital cases about 40 to 50 cases per week. Out of the previous 7 day cases 7 are selected using a RNG. Logistically we can do this on Friday, hence the period  previous Friday to Thursday i.e. yesterday. We enter data via LimeSurvey interface. For each selected case we enter the case date AssmDate and YesNo answers to 4 questions q0001 to q0004. I will need to do the operation weekly as we will do a weekly progress chart.p  pThe codelubridate weekcode method suggested below would be greatp  precodedataweekstartingfriday lt weekdataAssmDate5  codepre  pbut unfortunately does not work even if I modify it see below. I believe this is because that method still determines dates belonging to a certain week on basis SunMon or MonSun and I cant think of a way to ask lubridate to consider week being FriThu.p  pAs the project is still quite small I have an option to every time add the week period number manually in a spreadsheet program, which I might resort to eventually. However it would be great to discover a way to automate the process reliably in R. strongThank you guys for all the answersstrong  they have been very encouraging and have given new thoughts on how to work with R as I am just learning R.p

Negative 2095 pI was wondering what would be the best way to detect browser log off, I already have a timer set that invalidates the session after 30 minutes. But what if the user didnt not log off but simply exited the browser Another user opens up the same browser on the same computer, before 30 minutes, because the setting of going back to where you left off is toggled on in your browser settings.p  pSo far, we have a timer set every 30 minutes, we have a log out button, but other than that what could be the best way to log off or to know if a user exited its browser. The reason I am asking for this is because there is a lot of security issues related to the setting in chrome, firefox, etc. that lets users go back where they left off. Especially when browser crashes or forced to quit, if you open it the next day, it will go back to where you left off if you click Restore button when browser prompts you because it quit unexpectedly.p  pWhat about session hijackingp  pCurrently using Java  JSP with Javascript  jQuery on WebSphere.p

The CPU gets starved is pegged initially and memory is constant, so either it is swapping out  loading stuff into memory more than it needs to, or writes to coredata slowing it down.    Adjusting the coredata write frequency yields no difference in this effect though obviously effects performance.   Removing the autoreleasepool calls also yields obvious effects in this process.

No matter what changes I make to the print job, it always prints in the full A4 page and in landscape.p  pHeres my code to printp  precodeUIPrintInteractionController printer  [UIPrintInteractionController sharedPrintController] UIPrintInfo printObject  [UIPrintInfo printInfo] [printObject setJobNameReceipt] [printObject setOutputTypeUIPrintInfoOutputGeneral] [printObject setOrientationUIPrintInfoOrientationLandscape]  UIPrintFormatter printFormatter  [[UIPrintFormatter alloc] init] [printFormatter setContentInsetsUIEdgeInsetsMake0, 0, 0, 0]  [printer setPrintFormatterprintFormatter] [printer setPrintInfoprintObject] [printer setDelegateself] [printer setPrintingItemtargetURL] [printer presentFromRectsender inViewview animatedYES completionHandlerUIPrintInteractionController printInteractionController,BOOL completed, NSError error] codepre  pI also tried implementing the codechoosePapercode delegate method but it didnt help either.

Negative 2095 pI am facing bundle not resolved errors which ultimately lead to strongjava.lang.RuntimeException Application com.xyz.application could not be found in the registry.strong after upgrading to Eclipse 4.2.1. I get these issues when I run my application outside Eclipse and the app wont launch, the splash screen appears and I see a message to check logs.. Weirdly though the jars that are missing are found in the plugins directory of my application, I have checked the dependencies tab in Eclipse and added once again the bundles that are logged as not resolved but no luck, I have checked my MANIFEST file, but I see things are right is bundleversion mandatory in the manifest for every bundle I use I see some bundles dont have that property set in them.p  pThere is one more thing to note here, in my previous Eclipse 3.7.2 builds the application after launching creates many folders in the configuration folder, I see all those folders in 4.2.1 except for org.eclipse.ui.intro.universal, and I see that during my pde build for 4.2.1 I see that ant tries strongemtwiceemstrong to unzip org.eclipse.ui.intro.universal.nl1 and org.eclipse.ui.intro.universal.nl2.. and my nestedJars directory has just nl1 and nl2 jars for these two bunldes but the org.eclipse.ui.intro.universal.nl1.jar file has lot many files apart from nljar  I think nl1 and nl2 jars are supposed to be moved too from nestedJars folder, because I see that all the other bundle folders under nestedJars have no .jar in them and infact only nl1.jar and nl2.jar of org.eclipse.ui.intro.universal.nl1 and org.eclipse.ui.intro.universal.nl2 are remaining in nested jars.

Negative 2095 pIn is well known fact that exceptions are good feature but they are slow. Therefore, it is a good practice to use return flags. Now what if I use return flags, but just in case I wrap my code in trycatch, to be 100 sure that it will work disregarding on exceptional situations. I mean that my code will work mainly on flags, not based on exception handling. Now is this a good practice Is it sill slowp

However, another case has arisen, one in which I need to pull back the team object based on its codelocation     namecode.

Heres a very similar a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net49L2V3 relnofollowJSFiddle demonstrating the changea. But, now it cant seem to find the team object I want to pull.

Negative 2095 pWe are working on a solution which crunches log files generated by systems and does various analysis operations on these logs to come up with different views which can help to triage the issues. For e.g. building a sequence of error messages which are repeating across the logs.p  pCurrently we are loading the logdata in java collections and doing all operations by iteratingsearching through these collections which is affecting the performance. We are thinking to instead load the data in a database and fire queries on the data to get optimized search results. And for the same we are thinking on using an inmemory db which will give a better performance than a persistent store as disk readswrites will be minimized.p  pThe amount of data to be analyzed at a time may go up to few GBs 24 GBs and hence may exceed the RAM size on the machine.p  pQuestion What options can be considered for such an InMemory db Is GridGain a good option for the samep  pMost of our solutions shall be deployed on a single node and hence distributed capabilities are not the priority. What other inmemory dbs can be recommended for this purposep

Negative 2095 pIm using Jython and trying to get the user to input a password.  However, I would like it to show an asterisk rather than the characters that the user is inputting.  I managed to do something similar using getpass, but it required you to type into the cmd line, and it would just not show anything rather than an asterisk.p  pIm looking to have the user type into a dialog box the input command brings up a box that would be perfect.  For example, thisp  precodeimport sys  password  inputPlease enter your password  if password  None     if the user hits cancel     sys.exit0 codepre  pHowever, it does not mask the text.  I am able to do this using the java aspect of jython like sop  precodeimport javax.swing.JOptionPane as JOP import javax.swing.JPasswordField as JPF import sys  pwdF  JPF choice  JOP.showConfirmDialogNone, pwdF,     Please enter your password,     JOP.OKCANCELOPTION  if choice  JOP.CANCELOPTION     sys.exit0 password  pwdF.getText codepre  pA problem I have with this is that I cant get the cursor to default to the text field instead it starts on the ok button.  Primarily, though, Id like a more pythonic way of doing this.p  pI messed around quite a bit with java.swing, using layout and add components however, I didnt understand it enough to tweak it in a way that would work.p  pDoes anyone know a method of creating an input box with masked text different from the java version I postedp  pThanks.p

Negative 2095 pI have a geometry with its vertices in cartesian coordinates. These cartesian coordinates are the ECEFEarth centred earth fixed coordinates. This geometry is actually present on an ellipsoidal model of the earth using wgs84 corrdinates.The cartesian coordinates were actually obtained by converting the set of latitudes and longitudes along which the geomtries lie but i no longer have access to them. What i have is an axis aligned bounding box with xmax, ymax, zmax and xmin,ymin,zmin obtained by parsing the cartesian coordinates There is no obviously no cartesian point of the geometry at xmax,ymax,zmax or xmin,ymin,zmin. The bounding box is just a cuboid enclosing the geometry. p  pWhat i want to do is to calculate the camera distance in an overview mode such that this geometrys bounding box  perfectly fits the camera frustum.p  pI am not very clear with the approach to take here. A method like using a local to world matrix comes to mind but its not very clear.img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0QMN1.png altenter image description herep  pSpecktre I referred to your suggestions on shifting points in 3D and that led me to another improved solution, nevertheless not perfect.p  ol liCompute a matrix that can transfer from ECEF to ENU.

Although this works almost accurately, there is still a small bug i guess. I am not very sure if it a good idea to generate a new bounding box. May be it is more accurate to identify 2 points point1xmax, ymin, zmax and pointxmax, ymax, zmax in the original bounding box, find their values after multiplying with matrix and then do point2  point1.length. Similarly for y. Would that be more accuratep
Negative 2095 pIm trying to create an stdfunction from a movecapturing lambda expression.

Negative 2095 pI am writing test cases to check the contents of DialogFragment, which has a sepparate layout with multiple textviews. I want to assert, if certain textviews in DialogFragment instance are visible, but i cant find a proper way to use findViewById, because i am getting NullPoinerExceptions, when using parent activity as a context. I also tried to use LayoutInflater to create rootview with the layout source of that dialog and use that view as a context. But i am starting to think, that by doing this i am not getting the actual content of displayed dialog, but instead i am creating a new instance of view and its childrens. So when i use findViewById with the newly created view as a context, i am not getting access to the dialog, that was created in test case.p  pSo my question is, what is the proper way to access layout elements of DialogFragment with findViewById functionp
Negative 2095 pI am new to AndroidJava and hoping to get some help on a modification I am trying to make to sample code. I found an example for how to make a simple TCPIP Client here a hrefhttpandroider.blogspot.com201402androidsercerclientexampleclient.html relnofollowhttpandroider.blogspot.com201402androidsercerclientexampleclient.htmla. It works like a charm and I am able to establish a connection with the server. I am trying to modify the code to add buttons that can disconnect from the server, send a data, and display data coming in. p  pI am having trouble with the first modification where pressing the Disconnect Clear in the example button should disconnect the client on my app from the server. Rooting around the code, I figure I will need to use the socket.close command. My problem is that the socket is being created in the onClick for the Connect button and I believe I need to link the socket.close command in the onClick for the Disconnect button to that. How would I go about this Do I place a reference to it in the onClick method for Disconnect button Alternatively, do I place the whole onClick for the Disconnect button inside the onClick for the COnnect button so it would recognize the socket reference Is it just as simple as getting the onClick for Disconnect out of the onCreate Finally, is there a fourth way to do this that I am not even seeing  p  pI realize how basic these questions are but, as I mentioned, I am new to Android and Java so am just trying to move through my first app with advice from the community. The good news is I think that if I can get a grasp on this button and how to reference the socket being created, the others will be much easier to navigate.

So after testing this this is what I get. Since the image is always 100 of the viewport it gets smaller and smaller by height and width because of its aspect ratio. The text and button on the image just stays at a fixed place and after some point it goes out of the image. p  pWhats my mistakep  pP.S found a lot of topics but still, I am messing something up.

However, the variable inputs is undefined because the content doesnt appear to be in the actual HTML when it is called, which is strange because the function isnt called upon until the script has finished.

Negative 2095 pHaving a bit of trouble controlling my filelists when using multiple file type inputs. To be clear, I am not using a file input with multiple, but multiple single file inputs. The scenario is that a user can select 1 to 5 files, clear them all if they want, but still must send at least 1 file. So I have a max of five file inputs that I will be using on the form. For starters, I have two that I have put into a Fiddle and a CodePen for some reason they are not working like they are on my local. The user selects a file, that file and size is added to a separate list which shows the name and size and has a button appended to that which calls the clearfileInput function. The clearFileInput function deletes that file input since that seems to be the only way to truly remove the file so it does not get sent and I need it to clear the list as well.p  pa hrefhttpcodepen.ioisaacweatherspenfnscu relnofollowCODEPEN HEREa a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdpnjv7aa2 relnofollowJS FIDDLE HEREap  pHere is the HTMLp  precode  ltinput typefile namefilesToUpload idfilesToUpload onChangemakeFileList gt   ltinput typefile namefilesToUpload idfilesToUpload2 onChangemakeFileList2 gt   ltul idfileListgtltligtNo Files Selectedltligtltulgt  ltul idfileList2gtltligtNo Files Selectedltligtltulgt codepre  pAnd the script I am using is quite long because I have to duplicate everything but here is the complete script for onep  precodefunction makeFileList      var input  document.getElementByIdfilesToUpload     var ul  document.getElementByIdfileList     while ul.hasChildNodes          ul.removeChildul.firstChild          for var i  0 i lt input.files.length i          var li  document.createElementli         var fileSize  input.files[i].size         li.innerHTML  input.files[i].name ampnbsp ltspan idlblSizegtltspangtltinput onclickclearFileInput typebutton valueClear gt         ul.appendChildli          iful.hasChildNodes          var li  document.createElementli         li.innerHTML  No Files Selected         ul.appendChildli       function makeFileList2      var input  document.getElementByIdfilesToUpload2     var ul  document.getElementByIdfileList2     while ul.hasChildNodes          ul.removeChildul.firstChild          for var i  0 i lt input.files.length i          var li  document.createElementli         var fileSize  input.files[i].size         li.innerHTML  input.files[i].name ampnbspltspan idlblSize2gtltspangtltinput onclickclearFileInput2 typebutton valueClear gt         ul.appendChildli          iful.hasChildNodes          var li  document.createElementli         li.innerHTML  No Files Selected         ul.appendChildli       Code Starts document.readyfunction      filesToUpload.changefunction               var iSize  0         if.browser.msie                      var objFSO  new ActiveXObjectScripting.FileSystemObject             var sPath  filesToUpload[0].value             var objFile  objFSO.getFilesPath             var iSize  objFile.size             iSize  iSize 1024                  else             iSize  filesToUpload[0].files[0].size  1024          if iSize  1024 gt 1                      if iSize  1024  1024 gt 1                              iSize  Math.roundiSize  1024  1024  100  100                 lblSize.html iSize  Gb                          else                              iSize  Math.roundiSize  1024  100  100                 lblSize.html iSize  Mb                               else                      iSize  Math.roundiSize  100  100             lblSize.html iSize   kb                   filesToUpload2.changefunction               var iSize2  0         if.browser.msie                      var objFSO  new ActiveXObjectScripting.FileSystemObject             var sPath  filesToUpload2[0].value             var objFile  objFSO.getFilesPath             var iSize2  objFile.size             iSize  iSize 1024                  else             iSize2  filesToUpload2[0].files[0].size  1024          if iSize2  1024 gt 1                      if iSize2  1024  1024 gt 1                              iSize2  Math.roundiSize2  1024  1024  100  100                 lblSize2.html iSize2  Gb                          else                              iSize2  Math.roundiSize2  1024  100  100                 lblSize2.html iSize2  Mb                               else                      iSize2  Math.roundiSize2  100  100             lblSize2.html iSize2   kb                function clearFileInput     var oldInput  document.getElementByIdfilesToUpload     var newInput  document.createElementinput     newInput.type  file     newInput.id  oldInput.id     newInput.name  oldInput.name     newInput.className  oldInput.className     newInput.style.cssText  oldInput.style.cssText     newInput.setAttributeonclick, makeFileList     oldInput.parentNode.replaceChildnewInput, oldInput  function clearFileInput2     var oldInput  document.getElementByIdfilesToUpload2     var newInput  document.createElementinput     newInput.type  file     newInput.id  oldInput.id     newInput.name  oldInput.name     newInput.className  oldInput.className     newInput.style.cssText  oldInput.style.cssText     newInput.setAttributeonclick, makeFileList2     oldInput.parentNode.replaceChildnewInput, oldInput  codepre

Negative 2095 pIm working on a problem that is a variation of binpacking, but a bit more general form with extra constraints. The problem definition is as followsp  pWe have objects of varying sizes, which can be grouped up into object classes. We have bins that are of differing capacities, which also are grouped into bin classes all bins within the same class have same capacity. The object classes have constraints on which bins they may be placed into for example, an object of class A can be placed in either of the bin classes X or Y. The objective is to find the minimum number of bins in each class, that can yield an optimal packing of a given set of objects.p  pIs there a good mathematical formulation of this problem, and solution methods that you have come across Is this an extension of the binpacking problem where the same methods can be applied I understand it is NP hard. I was unable to find much about how to tackle the problem, so it would be quite helpful if you can point me in the right direction.p

Negative 2095 pHave a headache trying to understand squiggly awks and greps but not gotten far. I have 100 thousand files from which Im trying to extract a single line.

They are actual whitespace tabsp  pIm trying to output just this line that starts with Revenuep  precodeRevenue,444.000,333.000,222.000,111.000 codepre  pThis output line outputs the first word of the line and the comma ie Revenue, It then finds the two tabs ensconced in double quotes, looks backwards skipping the first set of comma separated numbers also assume that instead of numbers, there could be nothing ie just a comma separated blank and then outputs the 4 set of comma separated numbers.p  pIs this doable in a simple grep or awk or cut or tr command on cygwin that wont be a bear to run on 100K files  To clarify, there are 100K files that look very similar. Each file will contain lots of lines separated by new linecarriage return. Some lines will contain the word Revenue at the start, some at the middle as in the 2nd sample line I had paste above etc. Im only interested in those lines that start with Revenue followed by the comma and then the sequence above. Each file will contain that specific line.p  pAs a completion to this kind of task because working on 100K files would require this too, what would have to be added to sed to print out the current file name being operated on too  ie output like thisp  pFileName1 Revenue,444.000,333.000,222.000,111.000 [Ill post the answer here if I find it]p  pThank youp  pThanks to Sputnick for editing my question so it looks neat and thanks to shellter for responding.

So clearly its not a timing issue, because the test completes successfully well within the 10 second timeout in the breakpoint case, but fails after waiting 10 seconds in the nobreakpoint case.

Negative 2095 pIm having troubles with the JScrollPane in the design view of WindowBuilder Pro which Im hoping people can help with since I cant find anything on this anywhere else.p  pMy problem is how I move the scroll bar in the design viewp  pI have my JScrollPane and within that I have a JPanel in absolute layout with a set preferred size. This caused the scrolls bars of the JScrollPane to appear in the design view since they would now be needed due to the JPanels preferred size being greater than the size of the JScollPane.p  pHowever my issue is that I cannot move the scroll bar to actually scroll down and see all of my JPanel.  I cannot find out how to do this, but while testing how the JFrame as a whole would look, I got an error of some sort which I quickly fixed and paid no attention to. However, I then noticed that the scroll bar of the JScrollPane in the design view was no longer set to the top and instead the bar was about 10 of the way down the total bar. p  pNow when I try and run my JFrame, the scroll bar is automatically starting at this position of being about 10 down and not fully at the top. There is nothing else in my code that is causing this so I can only assuming that the scroll bars position in the design view is what is making the scroll bar act like this when I run it.p  pI have already tried what solutions I could find online such as                 scrollPane.getVerticalScrollBar.setValue0 but this does not work.p  pIs there any way I can move the bar back to the top I have not been able to find any key binds or the like which will do this. I can live with not being able to see the whole JPanel since I can just position it roughly and then run it to see how it looks, but the scroll bar not being at the top is quite an annoying issue.p  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 2095 pI ran across some code using codeexitcode to abort process a request as soon as an error was encountered. Im not a PHP expert, but my immediate reaction, knowing FastCGI at a high level, is that would exit the process and is generally a bad idea. This wasnt the case with Nginx and my current PHP, but with ancient Apache versions, a hrefhttpwww.fastcgi.comomarchivemailarchive0224.html relnofollowthis was a problema. PHPs documentation on FastCGI was a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenbook.fpm.php relnofollowpretty sparsea, but it did mention codefastcgifinishrequestcode which looks like a graceful way to finish the request.p  pThe documentation for codeexitcode is unclear on whether it has any performance implications for FastCGI, but there is the subtle distinction that it exists the emscriptem, not the process. The documentation for a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.header.php relnofollowcodeheadercodea actually uses codeexitcode, and I found the pattern in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3553698phpshouldicallexitaftercallinglocationheaderseverala a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2747791whyihavetocallexitafterredirectionthroughheaderlocationinphpStack Overflowa a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8665985phputilizingexitordieafterheaderlocation]postsa, but the justification was so you dont send a body, not if you dont emit a body after the header, the body will be empty and the redirect will work as expected.p  pI also found a hrefhttpserverfault.comquestions84962phpviafastcgiterminatedbycallingexitconflicting answersa on whether or not it causes problems. That, and a hrefhttpwiki.dreamhost.comFastCGINoExits relnofollowDreamhost recommends against codeexitcode when using FastCGIa though their examples in Perl. The one place it definitely causes problems is unit testing.p  pSo my question whats the best practice for using codeexitcode in PHP web pages Is codefastcgifinishrequestcode a better choice Would restructuring the control flow be better Are the problems people reported Apachespecific Or is this just another version of are multiple codereturnscode bad programming practicep

Negative 2095 pI recently started working on a site as a side project. As I am not entirely sure yet what method should I use to handledisplay content, I spent the last two days with trying to find the best method, unfortunately I found nothing useful  most likely because I do not know the correct terms to search by.p  pBasically, the site would use a menu system unrelated to my question to navigate the users to different categories which would let them select a  piece of content. The site then would display that page.p  pHere is a mockup of the content display system I want to buildp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comy423V.jpg altContent layout mockupp  pEvery article would be displayed like this with some modifications in a few special one they have a simple background image, a title, a few paragraphs of information,  one or two links to outside sources and an image which is sometimes can be interacted with clicking on it plays a sound, for example. None of these can be modified by the users and it wont be possible in the future, either  the only way to edit content currently is to edit strings in the database or edit the imagessounds stored on the server.p  pMy biggest problem is that I have not enough experience to be able to determine the best way to do it. Currently I use a lot of JavaScript  probably even too much. When the user clicks on a category, a code runs that generates a submenu as it didnt exists before the button press based on a database. This submenu is filled with buttons that are linked to different articles and use the same method on button press they generate and display the content.p  pI know this is a bad practice  during my research I read that I should not build the entire site from JS, but I used the same method in my previous project, where I had to make a system that lets the users view and modify a huge amount of DB entries in a quick and userfriendly way. Because of this I started to prototype the menu system using the same practices. But I plan to make a site that is available to a bigger user base and it entirely possible that I cant do it the same way  the previous site wasnt built to be usable by people with disabilities, for example.p  pCurrently I have three options to manage contentp  ul lipUse the same method as before have a few prebuilt elements then generate the requested content only when I have to, but do that every time the same content is opened. Its very JS heavy, but the user only have to download the necessary resources.pli lipCreate everything beforehand, so the site only displays the content. It does require less JavaScript and makes it possible to build most of the site with pure HTML and CSS. It comes with bigger downloads.pli lipCombine the two methods generate the content when the user needs it, but also store it, so returning to it only displays the already existing article.pli ul  pCould you advise me about best practice to use p

Negative 2095 pI am learning Boost Python interface especially on exposing the C function to Python. Now I have a problem on how to return a two dimensional array of C function to python side.

Negative 2095 pIm using python2.6s gdb module while debugging a C program, and would like to convert a gdb.Value instance into a python numeral object variable based off the instances .Type. p  pE.g. turn my C programs codeSomeStructgtsomefloatval  1.6code to a Python gdb.Value via codesfvgdb.parseandevalSomeStructgtsomedoublevalcode, but THEN turn this into a double precision floating point python variable  knowing that codestrsfv.type.striptypedefsdoublecode and its size is 8B  WITHOUT just converting through a string using codedblfloatstrsfvcode or codeValue.stringcode but rather something like unpacking the bytes using codestructcode to get the correct double value.p  pEvery link returned from my searches points a hrefhttpssourceware.orggdbonlinedocsgdbValuesFromInferior.htmlValuesFromInferior relnofollowhttpssourceware.orggdbonlinedocsgdbValuesFromInferior.htmlValuesFromInferiora, but I cant see how to convert a Value instance into a python variable cleanly, say the Value wasnt even in C memory but represented a gdb.Value.address so cant use codeInferior.readmemorycode, how would one turn this into a Python int without casting string valuesp

I want the thickness of each line to be the relative frequency with which each kind of ending occurred in that batch. p  pIn order to do this, I need to add another column to this data, count, that counts the number of times a particular ending occurs in a batch of runs grouped by dimensions and connections, and then have that number appear in each row characterized by that ending.p  pSo, lets say runs 1 through 10 are dimensions4 and connections2. Four of those runs end in stability, two in instability, and two in unity. Id like the count column to be 4, 2, and 2, for each row in that batch of data that got each respective ending. p  pThis is a tough one. Thanks in advancep

Negative 2095 pstrongSituationstrong I have a form for the user to change their profile. p  pThe form has input fields with event listeners attached for the codeonchangecode event so I can tell if the user has made any changes to the form. One of those fields is a password field. p  pIn the case where the browser is set to remember passwords, when the form loads, it fills in the password field and triggers my listener.p  pstrongWorkaroundstrong p  pI have set a timeout to reset my dataChanged flag after the page loads. Not very elegant. It seems that crawling the event.callee.caller stack is not recommended, nonstandard, and unlikely to distinguish user from browserinitiated events.p  pstrongQuestionstrong p  pIs there a way I can determine events triggered by the user interaction and javascript onlyp  pI dont want to emcancelem the event though, I just want to emignoreem it.p  pstrongClarification on choice of eventstrongp  pThis code is in our formhandling js library used throughout numerous applications. We need to know if the field has actually changed its contents so we can warn the user on leaving the form that data has not been saved. It is also used to trigger recalculation of other codependent fields.p  pUsing onkeyuponkeypress will trigger when the user presses nonediting keys like Tab, cursorarrow, Shift etc. We want to avoid having to store the contents as loaded, and compare that to the content after onkeyup to determine whether the contents have actually changed.  p  pBrowsers also trap conditions where the user edits the field, changes their mind and presses ESC or CTRLZ  onchange is not triggered. Event onkeypress fires many times during that process.p  pTherefore we would want to stick to onchange as the event of choice since it designed for our purpose  fire when content actually changes, once only when user exits the field.p

Negative 2095 pI have a Gray32Float bitmapsource which I want to render to a PNG. The issue Im having is that the bitmapsource has a low value that should be transparent. This value is arbitary, but I have written a routine that gives me the statistics of the image values back, which I can callp  precodeDictionaryltstring, dynamicgt statistics1  getPixelFloatStatisticsbitmap double transparentPixel  statistics1[min] Dictionaryltstring, dynamicgt statistics  getPixelFloatStatisticsbitmap, transparentPixel codepre  pNext I copy the bitmapsource to a bufferp  precodeint stride32  bitmap.PixelWidth  bitmap.Format.BitsPerPixel  8  float[] pixels32  new float[bitmap.PixelHeight  stride32] bitmap.CopyPixelspixels32, stride32, 0 codepre  pThis seems to fail. When I check the pixels32 array, I get a lot of zeros at the end, it seems the image is squished into the front part. The values look ok, the whole image just seems to be squished into a quarter, repeats itself 4 times and then the rest is blank.p  pThe rest of the code is just rescaling the image into a new gray8 bitmap source.p  precodeint stride8  bitmap.PixelWidth  PixelFormats.Gray8.BitsPerPixel  8 byte[] pixels8  new byte[bitmap.PixelHeight  stride8]  double span  statistics[max]  statistics[min] int strideRatio  bitmap.Format.BitsPerPixel  PixelFormats.Gray8.BitsPerPixel  for int i  0 i lt bitmap.PixelHeight  stride32 i  bitmap.Format.BitsPerPixel  8       pixels8[i  strideRatio]  pixels32[i]  transparentPixel  byte0  bytepixels32[i]  statistics[min]  span  254  1   return BitmapSource.Createintbitmap.Width, intbitmap.Height, bitmap.DpiX, bitmap.DpiY, PixelFormats.Gray8, null, pixels8, stride8 codepre  pThe result is that the image is squished into about a quarter, repeats 4 times and the rest is a solid color. As I wrote, this seems to happen already when I copy the gray32float into the float buffer. The solid color makes sense, since it takes the 0 and assigns it a color based on what my minmax values are and scales it.p  pThere may be other ways of solving this problem, when I directly convert the Gray32Float to Gray8, it sets 0 to a bunch of values so I cant separate out what should be transparent, areas that shouldnt be transparent will be transparent.p

Negative 2095 pIm using SDL in VS2013 and Im trying to load an image from the folder that my working directory should be using a relative path. Which is where the .vcxproj files are. However I discovered that the working directory is not the folder it should be, it is actually in CWindowsSystem32. I have realised that this is only the case when I go to linker, system and then change the subsystem to CONSOLE. In a WINDOWS subsystem it uses the correct working directory. Why is this happening and how do I fix itp  pI think it may have something to do with VS2013 using cmd.exe which is in the system32 folder but I cannot be certain and would not know how to fix it even if that is the case. p

I need for each item to be a slide and when you click one of the slides, that slide slides all the way to the left of the div and becomes active in color. p  pI cant figure out how im going to do this. My initial idea is a div with overflowhidden and then have a LONG div inside that with a huge width so all the items lay out horizontally, but they are hidden. Then when you click any item, the whole unordered list shifts left or right so that the active item is aligned left in the container div.p  pWhat i guess im looking for is some kind of example or solution that someone has seen in the browsing of the internet that I can look at for an example or any ideas on how to accomplish this.p

Negative 2095 pThe headline seems lengthy but what Im trying to do is quite simple.p  pI have a couple of identical buttons lined in a row and set their tags to 0...n. Clicking on any of them the 2nd for example would bring up a popover view in which there are several buttons representing different options A, B, C, D. What I want to do is to turn the 2nd Buttons title to B if we click on option B.p  pThe problem is that the popover view does not know which Button presented it, since all popoverViews are instances of the same UIViewController class. So I am thinking of distinguishing the n buttons by setting their tags to different values. However, I dont know how to get the UIButtons tag from a button inside the popover this UIButton presented.p  pMany thanks in advancep

But of course the coderefreshcode function can not be found, because of the isolated scope.p  precode   lthtmlgt     ltbody ngappquestiongt         ltdiv ngcloak ngcontrollerAppControllergt             ltmyitem ngrepeatitem in list datalistgt             ltmyitemgt             ltinput typetext maxlength50 ngmodelnewitem gt             ltbutton ngclickaddnewitemgtltbuttongt         ltdivgt         ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsangularjs1.4.5angular.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscriptgt          function                var app               app  angular.modulequestion, []                app.controllerAppController, [                  scope, http, function scope, http                       scope.list  []                       function refresh                          http.getapiitems.then                              functionresponse                                  scope.list  response.data                                                                                                     scope.add  functionitem                          http.postapiitems,  item item .thenrefresh                                             refresh                                ]               app.directivemyItem, function                   return                       scope                           item data,                      ,                       directive template with delete button                      template  item  ltbutton ngclickdeleteitemgtltbuttongt,                      restrict E,                       directive controller with delete function                      controller [ scope, http, functionscope, http                           scope.delete  function card    This is where it goes wrong refresh does not exist                              http.deleteapiitems  card.id.thenrefresh                                                ]                                                   ltscriptgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pOne thing I could do is add ngchange to the myItem directive, but that would involve requiring ngModelController which seems overkill.p  pOther things I can think ofp  ol lipAdd something like codeonchange code to the codescopecode attribute of the directive, then set codeonchange  refreshcode in the html. Call the onchange expression instead of refresh inside the codedeletecode function. But this feels like Im reimplementing  codengchangecodepli lipAdd coderequire AppControllercode to the directive. Then I guess I could call coderefreshcode on the parent controller directly. That seems like it violates loose coupling.pli lipDont use isolate scope at all. That would mean we inherit from the parent scope and coderefreshcode is available. But then my directive implicitly assumes that the scope will hold an codeitemcode. Which also violates loose coupling, but in an implicit way.pli ol  pSo my question is which is the correct way to let the parent controller know it should refresh its contentsp

Negative 2095 pI have recently discovered that you can connect the strongEclipse Task Liststrong with GitHub directly thus allowing a nice synchronization between a selected repository and what your are doing in the IDE related to that repository taskwise. Im using strongEclipse Mars 4.5.0strong.p  pI have created a GitHub Task Query you can see my settings belowp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqaNd3.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqaNd3.png altGitHub task query settingsap  pAt first I was able to create two issues that also appeared on GitHub. Both issue were however placed in a folder in the Task List interface saying strongUnmatched Automatic container for repository tasks not matched by any querystrong. Weird...But since today things got even worse  all tasks I create are placed in the strongUnsubmittedstrong folder. This makes perfect sense with one exception  whenever I try to submit the task I getp  blockquote   blockquote     pSubmit failed Unexpected error Requires authentificationp   blockquote blockquote  pSo basically after two tasks I can no longer even submit anything. Upon creating a task I make sure I select the task query I have selected for my repository. Also the idea of all this task synchronization is supposed to be bidirectional right When I create a task in the strongEclipse Task Liststrong I expect that it will be displayed on the repositories strongIssues page on GitHubstrong and the other way around  when someone creates an issue on that same page it should appear in my task list. This is at least my understanding of synchronization. The task query doesnt show any issue whatsoever. Validating it returns that everything is perfectly fine. Pressing on the synchronization button even though I have enabled automatic synchronization also doesnt return any errors.p  pAm I missing something or this is one of the buggiest plugins for Eclipsep
