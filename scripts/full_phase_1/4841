Positive 4841 pI have a dependency jReddit.jar in my local repo. When I build my project that has a reference to jReddit in its pom, I keep getting error when server startup because it cant find jReddit.jar in the target web inf. I check the target web inf, and the jReddit is there, only its a folder and not a jar. It looks like jReddit.jar but it is a folder not a jar. If I copy and paste the actual jar in my server it works, but I need it to build correctly. Inside my local repo the jReddit is there as a jar and looks normal.p  pI am not sure why this is happening because one day everything was working, then the next I cant build or deploy correctly. p  precode          ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtcom.github.jredditltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtjredditltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt1.0.5ltversiongt     ltdependencygt codepre  pI havent changed this since it broke, so I think its finep  pwhole pom p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt lt     JBoss, Home of Professional Open Source     Copyright 2013, Red Hat, Inc. andor its affiliates, and individual     contributors by the authors tag.

Positive 4841 pIt seems to me that it would be really useful to have the dependencies of a jar listed in its Manifest, possibly as an optional field. Without this feature, it is near impossible to know what a jar depends on, without finding it on the web somewhere, or using a dependency management tool, or something along those lines. Now that everyone is using the whole artifact ID, group ID, version convention, I would imagine this would greatly simplify the tools needed to setup a project.p  pI find myself needing to use maven more than I would like to because its such a hassle to figure out if something needs Apache commons or logging or whatever the case may be, why not just have the jars listed in some Manifest Fieldp

Positive 4841 pI am working on building a web application that needs to use a standalone JAR file at its core. Essentially, I have an application module packaged as a JAR file that I can run successfully on the Command prompt using a command like codejava jar myapp.jarcode and can pass some additional parameters as needed basically the file name to process. This JAR has some dependencies on other JAR files, which are placed in the libs folder located in the same folder as the codemyapp.jarcode file. All this is working fine as a standalone JAR file executed through the command prompt.p  pNow, I need to use this JAR inside a web application and do the same kind of processing. I have already got a Grails based web application setup with the required UI, etc. and I have added all the required JAR libs inside the codelibcode folder of my Grails web application. I have placed codemyapp.jarcode file as well in the same lib folder.p  pI am a little confused about how to run this codemyapp.jarcode file through my web applications Controller methods Basically, I have a form in my web application in which the users would specify the required file path needed to be processed by codemyapp.jarcode and then user would click the RunSubmit button. Upon that I need to launch codemyapp.jarcode with the supplied parameters of the file path and put the resultingprocessed file at some specified location.p  pSo, essentially do the processing similar to the standalone JAR execution on command prompt through the Web applications controller method.p  pCan someone kindly guide me regarding the right process to accomplish thisp  pAny help in this regard would be greatly appreciated.p

Positive 4841 pIve made this program with Eclipse. When I launch it emfromem Eclipse, it works flawlessly, but when I export to a runnable jar and launch that, it whitescreens. I tried running it through command prompt to see if I could get a decent error message. Turns out apparently it had something to do with image loading, specifically the case of the image title still strange that it worked in Eclipse but not standalone. Anyway, fixed those issues, now I have a similar one  still something to do with image loading if Im correct. p  pHeres my error output a hrefhttppastebin.comvPP0gWns relnofollowhttppastebin.comvPP0gWnsap  pCan anyone offer any insight Let me know if you need more info, any help is greatly appreciated.

Positive 4841 pShould you use .class files or .java files in a .jar libraryp  pI want to take a class that Ive written in a .java file and add it to a jar so I can use it as a library in my tomcats WEBINFlib directory.p  pI understand that jars can contain .class files, .java files, or both or just about anything else. Im wondering what is specifically needed at runtime for my jar to be readable by the JVM. The answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7232448newtojavalibrarieswhattoincludeinajarfilethis questiona told me that .class files will work, but will .java files work as well p  pIve found many descriptions of how to create a jar, and lots of information on the differences between .java files and .class files. What Im lacking, I guess, is an understanding of how the jar libraries are interpreted by the JVM. Are they compiled at runtimep  pThank youp
Positive 4841 pSo I was just playing with the idea of user plugins. I wrote a simple class that prints out a String. Then I wrote an interface which requires a single method for editing that String. Now, Id like to have the user be able to insert a Jar file into a folder packaged with the program and my program reads it in, and uses it as a class which implements the interface which I created. So basically I am looking for a way of reading in a jar files contents, and using its class as one of my programs classes. Apologies in advanced for any incorrect terminology, I am very new to this. If this is the wrong way to approaching the problem let me know, Im open to a better way.

Positive 4841 pI have a Maven project. It includes 2 jars A and B, each of them requires com.zeroc.Ice jar. Problem is, jar A requires Ice 3.4.2, and jar B requires Ice 3.3.1.p  pProblem is, that when running project with Ice3.4.2, some deep internal class of jar B throws NoSuchMethodError and in fact, there is no such method in this version, and it works the same way with Ice 3.3.1, but now jar A throws NoClassDefFoundError somewhere deep inside. Looks like there was a significant change between those versions of Ice, and 3.4.2 is not backward compatible.p  pIs there any way I could include both jars and tell which Ice version should be used for each of them A and B I am looking for solution, where there is no need to play with code of jars A or B  is it possiblep
Positive 4841 pIm having problems with a packaged program I built using the NetBeans IDE and Java Swing. When the project is built from netbeans, it copies all the libraries the program is dependent on, including the sqlite4java API that I use into a folder called lib within the folder dist. Dist also holds the executable .jar file. When the file is opened, the normal jFrame opens and the program runs fine until a SQLiteConnection is called. No errors are returned, but the program always fails to go past that point in the executable .jar file.

Positive 4841 pI have been trying to figure this one out for a bit, not coming up with the right approach.  I read through a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28243315attachjavafileassourceforjarinintellijthis questiona, which Id already tried, but its not working quite right.. using IntelliJ EAP 142.4675.3p  pWhat I am trying to do, is to debug a junit test using a jar extending the Provider class file Ive placed into JAVAHOMEjrelibext. I want that jar to be debuggable as well.p  pThe problem is, if I attach my source directory as the source for a jar, then, in a stack trace, when I click the named file containing a method I wish to view, IntelliJ asks me to choose between two of the same file, presumably because it knows about the source its in a module in my project and its also been told about the source via the jar source path I added.p  pI tried adding the provider.jar to the project module dependencies tab, which caused intellij no end of grief.  Reverted back to having it in jrelibext, and, in the Platform SettingsSDKs1.8Sourcepath tab, I added the module sourcepath.  This lets intellij step into the .java file for the jar, vs the .class file, but, when it does so, I now get a banner at the top of my code windows which says Alternative source available for the class xxx and theres a combobox at the RHS with the module name listed twice in the latest EAP, it actually lists the module and the jar [same name as module, with .jar].  And, as mentioned earlier, the IDE asks which which of the very same file I wish to edit when I click a file in the stack trace.p  pClearly, there is something not quite right.. what am I missing  I find it odd that the ide will not open the source code when stepping into the jar until I attach the code as above, but, when I do, it sees it twice.p

Negative 4841 pIm currently working on a raytracer in C as a hobby project. Im trying to achieve a decent rendering speed by implementing some tricks from a c implementation and have run into a spot of trouble.p  pThe objects in the scenes which the raytracer renders are stored in a KdTree structure and the trees nodes are, in turn, stored in an array. The optimization Im having problems with is while trying to fit as many tree nodes as possible into a cache line. One means of doing this is for nodes to contain a pointer to the left child node only. It is then implicit that the right child follows directly after the left one in the array.p  pThe nodes are structs and during tree construction they are succesfully put into the array by a static memory manager class. When I begin to traverse the tree it, at first, seems to work just fine. Then at a point early in the rendering about the same place each time, the left child pointer of the root node is suddenly pointing at a null pointer. I have come to the conclusion that the garbage collecter has moved the structs as the array lies on the heap.p  pIve tried several things to pin the addresses in memory but none of them seems to last for the entire application lifetime as I need. The fixed keyword only seems to help during single method calls and declaring fixed arrays can only be done on simple types which a node isnt. Is there a good way to do this or am I just too far down the path of stuff C wasnt meant for.p  pBtw, changing to c, while perhaps the better choice for a high performance program, is not an option.p

Negative 4841 pHope I can explain this somewhat decently, as its blowing a fuse in my brain today. Im learning TDD in C, so Im still trying to rewire my brain to fit it.p  pLets say I have a strongUserstrong class, that previously had a static method to retrieve a User object simplified below.p  precodepublic static User GetUserstring username     User user  GetUserFromCacheusername    ifuser  null            user  GetUserFromDatabaseusername        StoreObjectInCacheuser        return user  codepre  pSo Im trying to rewrite this to use dependency injection so I can fake out the GetUserFromDatabase method if it needs to go there. That means I have to make the function not static. Whereas the data access layer would construct the user object from the database, mapping the returned columns to the object properties, a retrieval from cache would return a trueblue strongUserstrong object. However, in a nonstatic method, I cant just sayp  precodethis  GetUserFromCacheusername codepre  pBecause it just doesnt work that way. Though Im by no means the world expert in how to dance around this with OO, it looks like Id almost have to grab the User object from cache and write another mapping function that would store the returned User object properties into the new User instance.p  pWhats the solution here Any OO magic Im missing Is the only solution to refactor everything to use factories instead of having the instantiation logic in the object itself Or have I been staring at this too long and missing something completely obviousp

Negative 4841 pI am trying to convert compressed swf files to uncompressed swf files using the cws2fws utility written by Alex Beregszaszi and which is part of the ffmpeg set of conversion routines.  The compressed files I am using are valid files as they can be opened and played by Firefox and other programs, but when I run them through cws2fws the program gives an error 5 indicating that the files is corrupt.  I have downloaded the source for the program and compiled it using Visual Studio.  When I run my file through the newly compiled program I get the same result as from the program I downloaded from the web.  While debugging the program I noticed that the two of the four bytes that are used to determine the uncompressed file size of the swf are negative see line 64 below.p  precode00056     if bufin[0]  C  bufin[1]  W  bufin[2]  S 00057      00058         printfNot a compressed flash filen 00059         exit1 00060      00061  00062     fstatfdin, ampstatbuf 00063     complen  statbuf.stsize 00064     uncomplen  bufin[4]  bufin[5] ltlt 8  bufin[6] ltlt 16  bufin[7] ltlt 24 00065  00066     printfCompressed size d Uncompressed size dn, complen4, uncomplen4 codepre  pSo, my questions arep  p1  I am feeling a bit dense, so could someone please explain the logic of determining the file size from the 4 bytes as shown in line 64.

But main problem is that I want to sort positions in destination div. I dont know how to make all elements time update with sortablechange event. I want time to appear after each div as my code show. This is a time when clip should start. I believe that I have to clear all attributes with codeb.removecode I only want to update time and then use code.eachcode function to recount all elements ant then append time to them. Can anyone help me with thatp  pHere is my code a hrefhttplukasz.webh.pltest.html relnofollowhttplukasz.webh.pltest.htmlap  pTo clarify what I want to achieve  For example lets say Itll be internet radio station program schedule. On the left hand we have available programs. We are choosing program witch we want to add to schedule and were dragging it to destination DIV. Then script is collecting its time and show when it should start. So every element time should be sum op previous elements. And theoretically it work until we want to change program position...p

Negative 4841 pIm using NetConnection, NetStream and a flash.media.Video control to play back video files stored on the local machine.  Works great for FLVs, and for H.264encoded MP4s, but for nonH.264 MP4s, I often get audio, but no video.p  pI realize this is to be expected.  What Im wondering is whether theres a way to reliably detect that the video portion of the file is unplayable, irrespective of the audio.  Of the many events available in NetStream, and even in the client callbacks onMetaData, etc., I dont see anything that explicitly informs for an unplayable video track  I see NetStream.Play.NoSupportedTrackFound, and NetStream.Play.Failed, but for these videos  i.e., playable audio, nonplayable video  I dont get either one, presumably because the audio works.p  pIs there anything better than attempting to make an inductive guess about this  Anyone solved this issue before  Im sure Im probably just overlooking something.p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 4841 pI have JAXWS style web service client that was autogenerated with the NetBeans IDE.p  pThe generated proxy factory extends javax.xml.ws.Service delegates proxy creation to the various Service.getPort methods. The application that I am maintaining instantiates the factory and obtains a proxy each time it calls the targetted service.p  pCreating the new proxy factory instances repeatedly has been shown to be expensive, given that the WSDL documentation supplied to the factory constructor, an HTTP URI, is reretrieved for each instantiation.p  pWe had success in improving the performance by caching the WSDL. But this has ugly maintenance and packaging implications for us.p  pI would like to explore the suitability of caching the proxy factory itself.  Is it safe, e.g., can two different client classes, executing on the same JVM and targetting the same web service, safely use the same factory to obtain distinct proxy objects or a shared, reentrant onep  pIve been unable to find guidance from either the JAXWS specification nor the javax.xml.ws API documentation. The factoryproxy multiplicity is unclear to me. Having Service.getPort rather than Service.createPort does not inspire confidence.p

Negative 4841 pA question about querydatabase performancep  pI have a table that records how many points a user has earned.   There is 1 row for every 1 point.  When someone gains 20 points, 20 rows are inserted into the database.  When someone looses 20 points, I will add a row with the value of 1 in the database.  Thus the number of points someone has can be calculated by performing a simple SELECT query that sums the points together.p  pPotentially, each individual user could have thousands rows to indicate points gainedlost, and my database could have thousands of users.p  pI need to show the points for the one user who is logged in on every page of the website.p  pThe question is will it hurt database performance to perform this SELECT query upon every page load, or is it more efficient to run the query once, store the value in a Cookie, and just display the Cookie on the page  The only risk I foresee is that if the users browser does not support Cookies, and that the Cookie is always updated to show the correct value.p

Negative 4841 pIm trying to understand how these languages work under the hood. Unfortunately I only ever read very superficial things.  Ill summarize what I know already, I would be really happy if you could correct me, and most of all, help me enhance my little bits of halfknowledge.p  pCp  pThe C compiler preprocesses all source files. This means, that it actually inserts strings into the places where macros where originally. After that, it creates an .obj file for each source file containing machine independant bytecode.  The linker then links all external .obj files from libraries with the custom made .obj files together, and compiles it into an .exe.p  pJavap  pJava code is compiled into machine independant bytecode which sits in .class files, which in turn can sit in .JAR files, which get run on the JRE. The virtual machine is just doing garbage cleanup then. Java code is compiled justintime like C, but with hotspot optimization developed by SUN.p  pCp  pPractically the same as Java C source code gets compiled into CIL Common Intermediate Language code, which is still human readable. This code will be run by the CLR JustinTime. This compilation turns methods into machine specific code just when they are first called.p  pIm actually interested in pretty much every language...but Java and C are almost the same, and I always wondered how the differentiate. And C is the classic so to speak. The father of both without any kind of virtual machine. Appreciate the helpp  pedit I know that this is a broad subject, but I really couldnt find any solid knowledge. If you have links or books that explain this sort of thing Im happy to go to work.

Negative 4841 pTwitter is a popular social networking service where users can write short messages in a onetomany fashion you can read more about it at Wikipedia.

Negative 4841 pI guess this question falls under best practices for PGP keys.  First a very quick background.  I lead an open source project, and have been getting numerous requests to publish to the Apache Maven repository.  To do this, I need to sign each release with a PGP key.p  pSo I used PGP and generated a publicprivate key on my local computer.  I exported and encrypted the secret key and transferred it to my build server.  The build server refuses to import the key, saying it is invalid.  Further analysis lead me to believe that because our build server runs under a different user id than I used on my local computer, they are incompatible.  p  pI would have thought, that since the PGP key pair is tied to my name, that emIem as a person should only own ONE PGP key  But is this really the case  Should I be generating one per machine  And just use the importexport to back them up   I can do this just fine, its when I try to replicate a PGP secret key over several machines it just seems really difficult and as though I am maybe using PGP in the wrong way.  Namely, I am thinking I create one key for myself and copy it to the build server, maybe also use it to encrypt email from myselfshould I need to do it, etc.  p

However, Im trying to remove the cart object from the process, and just process an order individually.

Negative 4841 pIve attempted to add Flurry analytics to my app project.  It is driving me nuts.  The app has logged some user data on a few occasions.  On others however I get a link warning when I build the app.  When that happens, it seems like it isnt logging the analytics.  I dont know what to do.  I move around the FlurryLib file and sometimes the error disappears. Then without changing anything, the error comes back.  p  pWhat causes a Link warning Is it possible that this error is what is keeping Flurry from logging analyticsbr How can I fix itp  pMy biggest concern is that the error reads a directory that doesnt exist.

By now, Ive isolated the code to the part thats causing me headachesp  precodeid initWithCoderNSCoder aDecoder      if self  [super initWithCoderaDecoder]          self.backgroundColor  [UIColor greenColor]         self.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, 320, 60         NSLog, NSStringFromCGRectself.frame          return self  codepre  pThis code is called when my custom view is loaded from a XIB file. This code attempts to resize the view. It does that, and the NSLog statement gives the same CGRect back as I pass to the view. However, whatever value I provide, the rectangles height is consistently 50 points smaller than its supposed to be.p  pIf I create the view programmatically with similar code, the rectangle is drawn correctlyp  precodeid initWithFrameCGRectframe      if self  [super initWithFrameframe]          self.backgroundColor  [UIColor orangeColor]         self.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, 320, 60         NSLog, NSStringFromCGRectself.frame          return self  codepre  pIt drives me nuts. What could cause thisp  pAs an additional question, what methods could I use to analyze  visualize the dimensions of views once the app is running in the iPhone simulatorp  p Updatep  pI finally found what caused the weird behavior of this UIView subclass. The view controller that loaded this view as its subview was loaded from a Tab Bar, which has a height of 49 points, so that got me thinking. Apparently, the default autoresizing options that are selected in interface builder cause the  view to resize, after the views bounds get reset in my custom initializer method. Setting no autoresize behavior in Interface Builder solves the issue.p

Negative 4841 pIm writing a library in C that I will later use for an application, and I want the library to be as efficient as sanely possible ie. dont overcomplicate things too much to make it more efficient. However, I have this question about how to most efficiently use reflection on a classmethods and to illustrate the question Ive simplified my class a lot down to thisp  precodeclass MyClass      private static Dictionaryltstring, objectgt methods      public void Method1               Do something.           public void Method2               Do something else.       codepre  pNow, what I want is from within the class a private method yet to be created, take a string containing the methodname, then fire the method, simple as that. The easiest way of doing this would be to just look at the name, get a method with that name, and execute it, but that forces me to use reflection a lot of times. This private method can potentially be called thousands or tens of thousands of times, and it need to be quick. So I came up with two possible solutions. As you can probably see Ive added a static dictionary containing stringobject replacing object with actual type, just wrote object cause that works with both my examples. Then Id add a static constructor that goes trough the class and adds all the methodinfos to the methodsdictionary. And then comes the question, on creation of a new instance of the class, should I create bound delegates to the methods and put those in a nonstatic private dict, or should I simply fire the methods using the MethodInfo in the methodsdictionaryp  pThe average usecase will create 10 instances of this class, and have 1000 calls to the method that should fire either Method1 or Method2 depending on its stringargument and no, switchcase is not an option because of the extensibility of the class, as said, this was a simplified version. What would be the most efficient way of achieving thisp

It would then do the same, masking the 2nd layer and showing the 3rd and so on.p  pI may have gone about it in completely the wrong way but any guidance would be appreciated.p  pThanksp
Negative 4841 pI have a codegridviewcode where images should be displayed. I have saved all the images in databases as blobs. Iam using a codehashmapcode and adding it to codearraylistcode. I also have a title along with each image.

The method is as followsp  precodepublic byte[] toBitmap Object obj            byte[] bytes  null       ByteArrayOutputStream bos  new ByteArrayOutputStream       try          ObjectOutputStream oos  new ObjectOutputStreambos          oos.writeObjectobj         oos.flush          oos.close          bos.close         bytes  bos.toByteArray          return  bytes               catch IOException ex         return null TODO Handle the exception        codepre  pThis method is returning codebyte[]code correctly. But, i could convert it into a bitmap codeBitmapFactory.decodeByteArrayblob,0,blob.lengthcode returns codenullcode. so could not set it to codeimageviewcode.p

If I set the pool to use NETWORK SERVICES, I cant create a local file, even through the domain account Im using has permissions and can do so interactively. If I grant the NS account permission to the files, it works. So I know for a fact that even though the view confirms that Im impersonating, resource requests dont use that account, but rather the pools.p  pIf I turn off impersonation, I see the pool ID in view, as expected.p  pFrom what Ive read I should be able to use basic authentication to access the remote sql server, right Not to mention the local disk.

Negative 4841 pI am browsing the code of a large open source application and would like to learn how it is designed and how it works. Is there a tool that can reverse engineer the C and C code into sequence diagramsp  pMay be this could be a bit far fetched but what about a tool which can give me the list of functions called in various modules and in right order when say the application is processing an input Or help me quickly analyze a given application esp one with a large code basep  pLooking forward to the answers as I am thinking this must be a well covered topic.p
Negative 4841 pI cant find much info on whether drawing from multiple vertex buffers is supported on opengl es 2.0 i.e use one vertex buffer for position data and another for normal, colors etc. This page  a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentation3DDrawingConceptualOpenGLESProgrammingGuideTechniquesforWorkingwithVertexDataTechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentation3DDrawingConceptualOpenGLESProgrammingGuideTechniquesforWorkingwithVertexDataTechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData.htmla and listing 9.4 in particular implies you should be able to, but I cant get it to work on my program.

No opengl call ever returns an error, and Ive inspected the vertex buffers extensively and am confident they have the correct sizes and data.p  pHas anyone successfully rendered using multiple vertex buffers and can share their experience on why this might not be working Any info on where to start debugging stalledfailed draw calls that dont return any error code would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 4841 pI just started using MongoMapper to manage nested models in a Sinatra app. In this particular case, I just need to check one of the fields when an EmbeddedDocument is initialized, and add a leading slash if one isnt already there.p  pMy idea was to write a check in the initialize method that will take care of it, except writing my own initialize will completely override the default, whereas I want to use the default with my own code added on. Ive been trying to find some resources on extending MongoMappers constructors, using super, or anything like that but I havent found much.p  pEven if this isnt the best way to solve my current problem ensuring a leading slash on a String field, Id also like to know how to extend MongoMappers default constructor, just for future reference. Thanks in advance.p  pEdit I found the MongoMapper Validation docs that solve my current issue of the leading slash. a hrefhttpmongomapper.comdocumentationpluginsvalidations.html relnofollowhttpmongomapper.comdocumentationpluginsvalidations.htmlap  pStill curious about the constructor extension though...p

Negative 4841 pI am trying to install Aptana as an Eclipse plugin for Zend Studio because the HTMLJavascript editor  is so much better in Aptana, but I still want Zend Studio to handle PHP.  I am receiving an Unsupported content type in editor message when I try to edit PHP files.  It appears that Aptana is trying to take over my PHP editing.  I am not sure if the message is Aptana complaining because the Zend Studio is opening the file or Zend Studio complaining because Aptana wants the file.  Obviously, a conflict exists as if I make the Aptana editor the default for PHP or uninstall the Aptana plug in, the message goes away.p  pI am wondering if I can just completely disable or remove the PHP Plugin from Aptana Studio 3 and see if that solves the issuep

What Im trying to do is package a python module which requires a library to be compiled which itself depends on other libraries which I need to somehow include in the package .I suspect that my problem is very similar to this one a hrefhttpmail.python.orgpipermaildistutilssig2009February010960.htmlhttpmail.python.orgpipermaildistutilssig2009February010960.htmla but that one was not resolved, I thought perhaps since its two years old a resolution has been foundp  pstrongUPDATE 2strong For now I have solved this by doingp  precode      datafiles[usrlocallib, glob.globunixx8664lib] codepre  pThat is to say, I am copying the libraries I need into usrlocallib. Im not hugely happy with this solution however, not least because it requires my users to have root privileges and also because this may still not work Redhat distros.

Negative 4841 pI have a VS11 beta WPF application with a Microsoft Datagrid based on a table from an Entity Framework 5.0b2 model from an sql server database.  The grid uses whatever code was autogenerated by adding a data source from an entity framework model and dragging and dropping a table from that model to the design surface..  I then used the EF5.0 DBContext code generator addin to generate DbContext types that I could use in the app.  p  pThe result was not good.  I got a compile error that seems unfixable at least my attempts made things worse.  The datagrid does not like DbContext and doesnt coexist with it when both the datagrid and DbContext are based on the same database and tables.  Is there a workaround, maybe by changing the code generator templatep  pThe error message is pasted at the end.  Thanks for any help or insight on this. p  pnote the following closely related post isnt an answer because though I can convert dbcontext to objectcontext, I cant get datagrid to work properly with it when I do and if I convert objectcontext to dbcontext, I dont have the autogenerated dbcontext types  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8059900convertdbcontexttoobjectcontextforusewithgridviewConvert DBContext to ObjectContext for use with GridViewa. Im looking for a fairly simple workaroundIm sure theres a workaround if I start hand coding all types and conversions, but I want to keep the ease of using the autogenerated codeI dont want to be occupied with work the code generator can, and so should, do.  If there isnt a solution, I suppose Ill base the controls on ado.net and leave entity framework for nonui code.  p  pErrorbr Cannot implicitly convert type  System.Data.Entity.DbSet to  System.Data.Objects.ObjectQueryp  pDocumentsVisual Studio 11ProjectsWpfApplication3WpfApplication3MainWindow.xaml.csp  pThe line that caused the error created by Microsoft drag and drop of the datagrid with an EF table as the source System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery myTblsQuery  myDbsEntities.MyTbls  p

Negative 4841 pI am looking for advice on most efficient table structureSQL code for a project I am working on for my company.  I am not a profesional developer so a simpler solution is preferable. p  pProject Requirementsp  pI want to create an HTML table that displays aggregate spend by vendor category by fiscal quarter where each of the categories is a link that can be clicked on to expand to get vendor level x business unit level spend.p  pI already have this up and running.  I built in PHP and MySQL.  However, the queries I run to expand the table are running VERY SLOWLY in some cases.  I want to overhaul my table structure and querying to make the whole process more efficient and flexible. p  pstrongSummary of the data that I havestrongp  pI get raw data every quarter from every business unit with spend by vendor.  I also have a decoder ring that matches vendor name to vendor category e.g. starbucks  restaurant.  p  pstrongMy Current Processstrong I roll up  quarterly data into a table called spendfile with the following columnsp  ul livendornameli listandardvendorname corrects misspells in vendor name, etc.li livendorcategory li liquarterli lispendli ul  pWhen I a request from a user for the first time to see the HTML table with the categories down side and spend by quarter in separate columns I create a temporary table called treetable with the following columnsp  ul lirowlabel name of categoryvendor that appears down side of tableli lispendQ1 separate column for spend with vendor in every quarterli lispendQ2 li lispendQ3li lispendQ4li lispend...li ul  pNote that in order to get this table I need to select all unique vendor categories, then sum spend by quarter for each quarter and finally join the quarterly total spend for each quarter to the category list so I am doing 56 joins, 1 for every time period.  p  pThen I render as html table fairly straightforwardp  pWhen the user clicks on a category to get more detail, I go through a similar process gettting unique list of vendors, summing spend this time for all vendors across a particular category and join all the time periods as separate columns.  p  pThe last step is to union the new drilled down data to the treetable table in the right spot underneath the category all the vendors belong to.  p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on better ways to do this  Does what I am trying to do make sensep  pThanksp

The purpose of the app is to let the user set the clock time and alarm time, and then the alarm should go off when the system time is equal to the alarm time.p  pThe clock class contains a Calendar and Date object.p  pThe clock is referred to from a main method outside the class. In that main method, I have built a simple command line user interface, where the user can set the time of the clock and alarm. By default, the clock is initialized to the current system time.p  pHowever, here is where the problem is for both the automatically initialized and the user defined clock objects  they arent ticking or updating.p  precodeClock regularClock  new Clock Defaults clock using a Date to the system time  while userInput  Quit     switchuserInput           ...Other choices here...       case Set Time  System.out.printEnter hour                      hours  kb.nextInt                 System.out.printnEnter minutes                  minutes  kb.nextInt                 ACR.regularClock.setTimehours, minutes                 System.out.printlnClock has been set         case Set Alarm System.out.printEnter hour              hours  kb.nextInt             System.out.printnEnter minutes              minutes  kb.nextInt             ACR.alarmClock.setTimehours, minutes             ACR.alarmClock.setAlarmOntrue             System.out.printlnAlarm has been set.             break       ...Other choices here...    userInput  keyboard.next     codepre  pAs you will see, there are no loops or anything to refresh or keep the regularClock ticking. For some reason, when I started I thought Date and Calendar objects just kept running once created  sort of like a stopwatch.p  pSo now Im wondering what the best way to update them would be, in this while loop. If only the default system time clock was allowed, it would be easy  I could just create a new Date object at the beginning of the while loop each time. However, that would override the user created clock time if they chose that.p  pAlso, if the user werent to enter any input  and instead just let the app sit there  where heshe would enter input  shouldnt it still be refreshing the times and checking if the regularClock  alarmClock time How can I do thisp  pI realize Im sort of rambling now, so Ill leave it at that. Ive been working at this but cant figure out the best solution. If you have any questions, please let me knowp  pShort summary questionsp  ol lipHow do I keep a the time in a Date or Calendar object ticking, even when it has been modifiedpli lipHow can I continuously update these objects, while waiting for user inputpli ol

Negative 4841 pIm passing a clientside JS array to serverside VB.NET code using a jQuery AJAX post request. I have a way that works, but Im wondering about best practices.

So I can leave the .toString offp  precode.ajaxurlmyhandler.ashx, datamyArraymyArray, type POST codepre  pWhen I did that, on the VB side I found that HttpContext.Request.Form no longer has a key myArray  It is now called myArray[], and lo and behold, it is a comma separated string Apple,Banana.p  pHere are my questionsp  p1 Is there a built in way to deserialize in VB.NET that converts the comma separated string back into an array of stringsp  p2 Is the Ajax serialization of my array just calling toString, and if a deserialize function exists is it just calling Split like I amp  p3 Are there any advantages of using the built in serializationdeserialization other than just being standard  I can think of a disadvantage.

Negative 4841 pThis is a longshot question, so bear with me. p  pI like to have my code warning free so that I can quickly determine if I have a warning that truly needs to be dealt with.  I have it set that if certain javadoc items are not correct, it will display a warning.  In the team I work with, they are not concerned with javadoc warnings in the unit tests.  These tests are always at srctestjava.  Unfortunately if there is a warning in the test, it not only shows the warning icon on the code folder srctestjava, but also on the project itself.  Im tempted just to javadoc all of their unit tests, but its not a good use of my time.  Is there a way to tell eclipse to ignore warnings from srctestjava or trigger different warnings for my tests than for my implementationp

Negative 4841 pAlthough Im technically working in the android platform with OpenGL 2.0 ES, I believe this can be applied to more OpenGL technologies.p  pI have a list of objects enemies, characters, etc that Im attempting to draw onto a grid, each space being 1x1, and each object matching.  Presently, each object is self translating... that is, its taking its model coordinates and going through a simple loop to adjust them to be located in the world coordinates in its appropriate grid location.  i.e. if it should be at 3,2 it will translate its coordinates accordingly.p  pThe problem Ive reached is Im not sure how to effeciently draw them.  I have a loop going through all the objects and calling draw for each object, similar to the android tutorial, but this seems wildly ineffecient.p  pThe objects are each textured with their own square images, matching the 1x1 grid they fill.  They likely will never need their own unique shaders, so the only thing that seems to change between objects is the verticies and the shaders.p  pIs there an effecient way to get each model into the pipeline without flushing because of uniform changesp

Negative 4841 pI am using extjs 4.0 and having a combobox with queryMode remote. I fill it with data from server. The problem is that the number of records from server is too large, so I thought it would be better to load them by parts. I know there is a standart paginator tool for combobox, but it is not convinient because needs total number of records.  The question, is there any way to add dynamic scrolling for combobox When scrolling to the bottom of the list I want to send request for the next part of records and add them to the list. I can not find appropriate listener to do this.p  pUPDATED Found out solution, it is posted in the answersp

Negative 4841 pWe have a caching solution which relies on StructureMap to provide the correct cache implementation to developers. Im trying to reduce the amount of StructureMap configuration needed, but have gotten stuck... The cache providers such as local cache, distributed, ... all implement the interface codeICacheltTgtcode, and types are registered against different cache profiles as per the need for crossserver consistency. A profile is then mapped agains some cache provider. Currently, it is required to specify for each type cached how it should be cached, which gives a lot of lines like these in initializationp  precodeCacheSetup.CacheTypeltFoogt.WithltLocalMemoryCachegt CacheSetup.CacheTypeltBargt.WithltLocalMemoryCachegt CacheSetup.CacheTypeltBazgt.WithltDistributedCachegt codepre  pEach of these lines basically fetches the cache provider for the requested profile and the registers that provider implementation of codeICacheltTgtcode for that type.p  pWhat I want to do, is to be able to set a default cache profile that will be used for types that are not explicitly registered. In the above example, Id like to set codeLocalMemoryCachecode to the default profile, and then when codeGetInstanceltICacheltFoogtgtcode is called, it should be resolved by the cache provider associated with that profile. Ive been reading the documentation extensivly, especially the interception parts, but there doesnt seem to be a way to intercept strongbeforestrong the instance is created, which I would need. p  pAny ideas how this could be accomplished p

The server works locally under localhost80, but I cannot get it to work on the EC2 instance.p  pI connected an elastic IP to the instance, and it at least works to access ssh on that IP.p  pI think the problem is that Im setting the serveraddress for the HTTPServer incorrectly a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2librarybasehttpserver.htmlBaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer relnofollowPython HTTPServer documentationa Since I really dont have a clue, at home I configured the router to forward HTTP requests to the computers local IP, 192.168.1.xxp  pI thought that it might be a security group issue, so I added inbound HTTP with source 0.0.0.00 which I thought should allow all incoming IPs and sets port 80 without any option to change.p  pAdditionally, I think that running the server script under sudo on port 80 is a potential security risk. Is there any way to forward the request under another port like 8080 instead of 80p

Negative 4841 pIm relatively new in COM, so appologies if this is a stupid question. Im having a bunch of COM interfaces compiled into a type library emAem. This type library is a resource in one of the DLLs ema.dllem in my solution. In a separate type library emBem that goes into a separate DLL emb.dllem I would like to define a coclass that implements an interface from type library emAem. See the IDL code below as a simplified example of what I have in mindp  precodeimport oaidl.idl import ocidl.idl   Import IMyInterface, which is part of MyLibA.tlb import MyInterface.idl  [     uuidE80492A81E8C4ABFB4DE9C252C445AFE,     version1.0,     helpstringMyLibB Type Library ] library MyLibB      importlibstdole32.tlb     importlibstdole2.tlb     importlibMyLibA.tlb       [         uuid25E3CD5EFA064845BE3EF260985AFB20,         helpstringMy CoClass     ]     coclass MyCoClass               [default] interface IMyInterface       codepre  pI can compile the above ok, but when I open the tlb file generated by MIDL in oleview, I get an error message codeTYPEECANTLOADLIBRARYcode. Im beginning to suspect what I want to do is not possible. My experimentation so far suggests that type libraries need to contain all the interfaces that a coclass implements along with the coclass definition itself. Is this truep  pIf I remove the codeimportlibMyLibA.tlbcode statement, I can view the compiled tlb file in oleview without errors, but emMyLibB.tlbem then also contains the definition of the codeIMyInterfacecode interface, i.e. the interface is defined twice in both type libraries. I dont want this because in my application I load both ema.dllem and emb.dllem using registrationfree COM. In this scenario, the activation context generation fails when it encounters the same interface definition in more than one type library.p  pAny suggestions how I can achieve the desired interface and coclass separation in separate type librariesp

When the colour shuffle is applied though its the default red,blue,green if you were to put them in the css.p  pI have had a look online but i am unsure of where else to look as it is working just not on the jQuery snippet so i assume its something to do with the jQuery function.p  pPHP at top of headerp  precodeltphp colours  arrayred, yellow, pink, blue, green  shufflecolours  random  colours[0] gt codepre  pOn the body tag its echoed as an idp  precodeltbody idltphp echo random gtgt codepre  pLink codeltscript typetextjavascript srcajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjqueryui1.10.0jqueryui.min.jsgtltscriptgtcodep  pAnd on any divs or elements i want them to change colour before them in the css is green,red ect and the colour so if i wanted the share class  to change my css is like thisp  precodegreen .share      color79b74c  red .share      color900  codepre  pNow this all works apart from my hover shuffle states with the jQuery functionp  precodedocument.readyfunction      colour rollover navigation     .share.hoverfunction         this.stop.animate color ltphp echo random gt , 300     ,function         this.stop.animate color fff , 300      codepre  pIt must be something to do with the jQuery as it works well when its removed, and does work when applied but its taking the colours from the php as csss default colour hex codes.p  pThanks.p

Negative 4841 pI need to add a new method that computes connected components to OpenCV 2.4.4 to use in one of my own projects.  I already have the code for the function from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4641817blobextractioninopencv1011659110116591this questiona Thanks to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers1327999jasonjasona, I navigated my way to a hrefhttpcode.opencv.orgattachments467opencvconnectedcomponents.patch relnofollowthe patcha where I found both the code and the header.p  pWhat I did was to add a new file codeconnectedcomponents.cppcode in codeCopencvmodulesimgprocsrccode, in which I placed the code for this new function.  Next, I went to codeCopencvmodulesimgprocincludeopencv2imgproccode and I added the appropriate export header to codeimgproc.hppcode.  Finally, I rebuilt the codeopencvimgproccode project in the OpenCV source code using Visual Studio 2010.  Everything builds fine, and generates the codeopencvimgproc244.dllcode, codeopencvimgproc244.libcode, and codeopencvimgproc244.expcode files for me.p  pNow, I copy these files except for the .exp, where I cant find where it should go into my existing OpenCV directory and replace the old files.  When I now try to build my own project, everything still builds fine, but I cannot access the new method from here.  I include codeinclude ltopencv2imgprocimgproc.hppgtcode, and from here I can access all the other methods in the file, except for the new one that I want.p  pThe fact that everything compiles but that the method is not exposed leads me to think there is some other file that I should have changed as well, however, due to lack of experience I do not know where or what this file could be.p  pExtra information I am using Visual Studio 2010, OpenCV 2.4.4 and built OpenCV with CMake 2.8.10.2 I am aware that there are libaries such as a hrefhttpopencv.willowgarage.comwikicvBlobsLib relnofollowcvBlobsLiba that compute connected components, and I have successfully used these in my project.  However, I want a faster and more recent solution cvBlobsLib still uses the old IplImage.p

In reality each page uses the same template just populates with different data.

Ex. newpage1 has been created and now exists in the DB. Now when I type in www.mysite.comnewpage1 this needs to go to a controller that looks up newpage1 in DB and if it exists loads a view THIS VIEW WILL NEED TO BE USED FOR ALL 600 pages which then takes other data from the DB and populates various sections.p  pSo essentially, over 600 pages need to use the same route array and map to the same controller which then maps to the same view.p  pIve tried using route[any]  customcontrolercreate1 and as well as the same array key but using main and remap. No matter what every single time it tries to look for the page name in my views which it will never exist because Im using one generic view for 600 pagesp  pAny ideas on how to accomplish thisp  pUPDATE routes.php this is the last line in the filep  precoderoute[any]  maincreate1 codepre  pmain.php controllerp  precodeclass Main extends MYController   public function construct      parentconstruct  public function createpage      c  new Category     cgtgetbynameucfirstpage     thisgtloadgtviewsiteindex,c  codepre  pp  pthe URL Im attempting is sitename.servername.comhealth    sitename and servername obviously substituted.p  pThe error I get isp  pAn Error Was Encounteredp  pUnable to load the requested file healthmaincreate.phpp

Negative 4841 pIve had to migrate many Wordpress web sites from different domains on the same server to different domains on different servers. In few cases, a simple export was sufficient. In many cases, an import failed to load the media correctly and I was forced to use a common work around.p  pWorkaround for those wondering I download from the original site and upload to the new site the uploads folder where my media is stored via FTP. Once this transfer is complete, I use the plugin Add From Server to select each individual image, one directory at a time.p  pThis is the best workaround Ive found, but its hardly efficient. Its incredibly time consuming and stressful on your bandwidth.p  pIf you have any better suggestions, Im all ears. But primarily, I want to know the Why to this question. What causes Wordpress to have such a hard time managing media migration while migrating posts, pages, and users are much less of a headachep

Negative 4841 pI am new to Angular and Ive learned quite a bit in the last few weeks, however I have several questions. So currently I have a jQuery prototype that I would like to convert to use Angular.js. For any animations or page transitions I am using css transitions. To change pages I am changing the body class with jQuery which in turn animates elements on or off the page. p  pIn Angular, views are displayed and removed with no animation at all. The way I need it, some views would use some elements from the last view.p  pFor example, There is a start view and a search view that contains a search input field that animates. When the page is loaded, the start view is loaded. When the user clicks submit, it would then load the search view but the search bar should stay there and animate to the top for future searches.p  pI am somewhat confused as to how to go about doing this. Any suggestions Thanks.p

Negative 4841 pFirstly, apologies for the length of this question, but I want to explain myself fully from the outset.p  pOK, a bit of background. Ive been working on some code that implements the Weak Event pattern using the codeWeakReferencecode object. In doing so I ran into the usual problem of objects being leaked in certain scenarios where a publisher stops raising events. If you are interested then theres a fair bit of a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles29922WeakEventsinC relnofollowinformationa on the pattern out there. The WPF team implemented the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.weakeventmanager.aspx relnofollowWeakEventManagera to tackle the problem which I believe uses a scheduler to check for any leaked objects and gets rid of them.p  pI decided to try a different approach. Instead of using a scheduler I wanted to trigger the detection and unsubscription of leaked objects using garbage collections. This seems logical to me as the targets of any codeWeakReferencecode objects are only dropped as a result of collections. This then led me to code up something which would raise an event when a garbage collection had taken place. Firstly I looked into using the frameworks codeGC.RegisterForFullGCNotificationcode mechanism but quickly realised it wasnt feasible as it a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc713687.aspx relnofollowcannot be used with concurrent garbage collectionsa. Then I did a fair bit of reading on the topic and found Jeffrey Richters a hrefhttpwintellect.comblogsJeffreyRreceivingnotificationswhengarbagecollectionsoccur relnofollowsolutiona but this has a couple of problems and only alerts you gen0 and gen2 collectionsp  pLong story short, I build the following simple class. The purpose of this class is to generate event notifications that a garbage collection has occurred. However, the mechanism for generating these notifications is based on the finalization of a detector object. As such, the events are NOT raised when a garbage collection is taking place but afterwards when the finalizer thread is run.p  precodeusing System  namespace Test       ltsummarygt      Class responsible for monitoring garbage collections.      ltsummarygt     public static class GarbageCollectionMonitor              private static readonly object syncLock         private static int generation0CollectionCount         private static EventHandlerltEventArgsgt generation0Subscriptions         private static int generation1CollectionCount         private static EventHandlerltEventArgsgt generation1Subscriptions         private static int generation2CollectionCount         private static EventHandlerltEventArgsgt generation2Subscriptions          public static event EventHandlerltEventArgsgt Generation0GarbageCollected                      add                              lock GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock                                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation0Subscriptions  EventHandlerltEventArgsgtDelegate.Combine  GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation0Subscriptions,                                                                                                                     value                                            remove                              lock GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock                                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation0Subscriptions  EventHandlerltEventArgsgtDelegate.Remove   GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation0Subscriptions,                                                                                                                     value                                                 public static event EventHandlerltEventArgsgt Generation1GarbageCollected                      add                              lock GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock                                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation1Subscriptions  EventHandlerltEventArgsgtDelegate.Combine  GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation1Subscriptions,                                                                                                                     value                                            remove                              lock GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock                                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation1Subscriptions  EventHandlerltEventArgsgtDelegate.Remove   GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation1Subscriptions,                                                                                                                     value                                                 public static event EventHandlerltEventArgsgt Generation2GarbageCollected                      add                              lock GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock                                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation2Subscriptions  EventHandlerltEventArgsgtDelegate.Combine  GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation2Subscriptions,                                                                                                                     value                                            remove                              lock GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock                                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation2Subscriptions  EventHandlerltEventArgsgtDelegate.Remove   GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation2Subscriptions,                                                                                                                     value                                                  ltsummarygt          Constructs the garbage collection monitor type          ltsummarygt         static GarbageCollectionMonitor                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock  new object               Construct a detector object                           N.B.

A local reference to the subscriptions delegate is required because                  this method is run on the finalizer thread which is started AFTER the                  garbage collector has finished running. As a result it is likely that                  the application threads that were frozen by the garbage collector will                  have been thawed. Since delegates are immutable, by getting a local                  reference the processing of the subscriptions is made threadsafe as any                  attempt by another thread to asynchronously add or remove a subscription                  will result in a separate new delegate being constructed.

In this example the 6th and 13th collections of generation 0 are not raising events.p  pNow finally comes the question.p  pIm baffled by this and need to understand why it is happening. My reasoning is that since there is no guarantee when the finalizer thread will run it is possible that multiple garbage collections of any generation may occur between instances of the finalizer thread being run.p  pIf this is the case then the only guarantee that can be given is that if an event is raised then a garbage collection of that generation has taken place since the last time the event was raised.p  pThats the best I can come up with but I would really appreciate if someone with more knowledge of garbage collection internals could confirm if it is correct and I dont have huge implementation error in my solution.p  pThanks for bearing with me.p
Negative 4841 pI have read about how boolean columns dont serve much as searching indexes..

Negative 4841 pTo explain the issue, I had codeViewControllerAcode with a codeUITableViewcode called codecommentTableViewcode inside of it. and from codecommentTableViewcode i would segue to codeViewControllerBcode but I needed to add an addition codeUITableViewcode called codementionedFriendTablecode to codeViewControllerAcode. But once i did add codementionFriendTablecode I started to have issues with the tables that caused the app to crash. p  pstrongIssue Im Havingstrongp  pI decided to place codecommentTableViewcode into a different class called codejustCommentsTablecode which is a codeUITableViewController classcode and add that class to codeViewControllercode.

Negative 4841 pI have embedded a WebControl in a Windows Forms application to access a serverside page, which is available after a login. Normally, when the user logs in, the application written in RoR creates a cookie on the clientside. I am using CookieStore Rails session store for storing the session data on the client side. Additionally, I am using a web session provider, set up with a specific data path, to store the session on disk. To add to the issue, I am sharing that data path among several web session providers.p  pNow, my problem is that if the user logs out by clicking the logout link, the page is updated fine. The user can no longer perform operations that require authentication. However, as I can see the Cookies database does not get updated immediately I see it from the files modification date, as well as from the cookie value which stays the same. I am guessing some inmemory storage is updated first, which is then dumped into disk. I cant quite determine when, but I notice that after some time seemingly randomly the Cookies database is updated on disk. However, this still creates a problem, because if the user closes the application immediately after logging out, and the Cookies database hasnt updated yet, then it would have a reference to the old cookie. Expectedly, strongwhen the user opens the application again, he will be displayed as logged instrong. I know this could be strongpartlystrong mitigated by storing sessions on the server side, but I would prefer to keep things this way.p  pSo, my question is Is there a way to force an automatic Cookies database update on diskp

Negative 4841 pWe have a Tomcat ValveBase class implementation that is doing the authentication for our servlet container apps. One way to authenticate our http REST calls is to sign them and then check the signature on the server side. We do this check in the ValveBase class. p  pThe problem is that after we consume the InputStream of the request for validating the signature, we pass the request org.apache.catalina.connector.Request to the next valve implementation and by the time it hits the servlet, the inputStream is gone. No content to be delivered, since it was consumed at the signature verification procedure.p  pIn the javax.servlet api, you can use an HttpServletRequestWrapper to implement your own ServletRequest and pass the real request as a constructor argument. In that case, we were able to avoid the situation where the content was read only once, but in the case of the catalina Request, seemed to be more delicate than we thought. Any ideas Thanks.p

Negative 4841 pHow can I use codenewsyslogcode to trigger a script everytime my log file is rolled over or rotated The script is a parser which collects the important information from the log and archives it. p  pIs using the codepathtopidcmdfilecode in newsyslog.conf the only way to do something like this The problem I have with this approach is that this means my parser script would need to always be runningsleeping in the background and I would be signalling it. p  pI was wondering if there was a cleaner way to do this Just before the logfile is to be rotated, the parser script should be run and data archived after which the parser dies.

I want the GridSplitter to be applied to all rows of a group. I understand that this is because I make a new Grid for every item. For the attached properties to work the items have to be a direct child of the Grid.  A DataGrid also isnt an option because the GridSplitter is only available between column headers. p  pSo to make a long story short how can I use a Grid in an ItemsControl with a GridSplitter that applies to all rows of ideally a group or the entire Grid if that isnt possible.  p

Negative 4841 pApologies for the fairly generic nature of the question  Im simply hoping someone can contribute some suggestions andor ideas as Im out of bothp  pThe background We run a fairly large 35M hitsmonth, peak around 170 connectionssec site which offers free software downloads stricly legal and which is written in ASP .NET 2 VB .Net  . We have 2 web servers, sat behind a dedicated hardware load balancer and both servers are fairly chunky machines, Windows Server 2012 Pro 64 bit and IIS 8. We serve extensionless URLs by using a custom 404 page which parses out the requested URL and Server.Transfers appropriately. Because of this particular component, we have to run in classic pipeline mode. DB wise we use MySQL, and have two replicated DBs, reads are mainly done from the slave. DB access is via a DevArt library and is extensively cached.p  pThe Problem We recently past few months moved from older servers, running Windows 2003 Server and IIS6. In the process, we also upgraded the Devart Component and MySql 5.1. Since then, we have suffered intermitted scalability issues, which have become significantly worse as we have added more content. We recently increased the number of programs from 2000 to 4000, and this caused response times to increase from lt300ms to over 3000ms measured with NewRelic. This to my mind points to either a bottleneck in the DB relatively unlikely, given the extensive caching and from DB monitoring or a badly written query or code problem. We also regularly see spikes which seem to coincide with cache refreshes which could support the badly written query argument  unfortunately all caching is done for x minutes from retrieval so it cant always be pinpointed accurately. All our caching uses locks like this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions39112whatisthebestwaytolockcacheinaspnetWhat is the best way to lock cache in asp.neta, so it could be that one specific operation is taking a while and backing up requests behind it.p  pThe problem is... I cant find it Can anyone suggest from experience some tools or methods Ive tried to load test, Ive profiled the code, Ive read through it line by line... NewRelic Pro was doing a good job for us, but the trial expired and for political reasons we havent purchased a full licence yet. Maybe WinDbg is the way forwardp  pLooking forward to any insight anyone can add p

Negative 4841 pI would need to migrate a SQL database from Sybase to MS SQL Server.

The test migration was successful and I would now like to deploy my SSISpackage to the real servers.p  pHowever, it seems I cannot simply run the package in Management Studio choosing different data sources for it  it only runs on the same databases for which it was created. Now, it can be edited in something called SQL Server Business Intelligence Development Studio or BIDS for shortI am using the SQL Server 2008 version, but going through every data flow task changing the destination source manually for each of the  150 tables I am moving is ineffective and also introduces a possibility for error.p  pI there a way to quickly change what data source is to be used for ALL destination sources in ALL the flow tasks of an SSISpackage If not, what simple method is there for testing migration with test databases first and simply changing the data sources when deploying p  pI am using ODBC data sources, but for some the package shows OLEsources in BIDS instead.p  pI hope I was clear enough.

So let say, I want to translate the above string, it would do something like thisp  precodeifntranslateThe lthinputText valuemyBean.val1 validatormyBean.validator1 gt ifntranslateis.using.for lthinputText valuemyBean.val2 validatormyBean.validator2 gt ifntranslatedays codepre  pHowever, these does not work well with let say Japanese translation. First, in Japanese, there is no codeThecode. Second, the positions of the codeinputTextcode are only make sense for English, but for Japanese, the codeinputTextcode need to be some other locations. One solution I see is to embed the html component in the translation string in code.propertiescode file, like thisp  plabelen.propertiesp  precodemy.StringThe ltinput gt0ltinputgt is using for ltinput gt1ltinputgt days codepre  plabeljp.propertiesp  precodemy.Stringltinput gt0ltinputgt XXX XXX XXX ltinput gt1ltinputgt XXX XXX XXX codepre  pHowever, this solution wont work for JSF component like codehinputTextcode, so can anyone suggest another solution for this.

Negative 4841 pIm a researcher in applied mathematics. I code on a daily basis, but my focus has always been science not coding so Ive never learned about good software engineering practices. Im trying to change that at least a little.p  pCurrently Im working on a few simulations that are relatively similar lets call them S1 S2 and S3. I wrote the code for S1 first. Then lets say I want to write code for S2. Its similar enough that it would make sense to just copy the code for S1 and change things around a little. Is the proper workflow for this kind of situation to setup a branch in git Im not sure if that functionality is intended for versions of code that are meant to live concurrently or if its intended for trying out some modifications and perhaps eventually making the branch the main version of a code.p  pThe other thing Im finding is that sometimes when I edit S2 I see something thats either a mistake or an inefficient way to do something. So Id like to change this code but I would also like to have the change reflected in S1. Any ways to do this efficiently or do you basically have to propagate the change in all your codes by hand Of course an automated tool wouldnt be able to distinguish which changes Im making are essential to the difference between S1 and S2 and which should propagate. But perhaps if the tree structure in git is exploited, the extra information it provides could be useful herep  pThanksp

Negative 4841 pI have an Asp.Net MVC 5.1 website. Weve got 3 types of users and I want to add support for chat between one type of them. I have thought of some models like thisp  precodepublic class Conversation      public NormalUser A  get set      public NormalUser B  get set      public ListltPrivateMessaagegt Messages  get set    public class PrivateMessaage      public NormalUser Sender  get set      public NormalUser Receiver  get set      public string Message  get set      public DateTime Created  get set   codepre  pAlso, Im using SignalR in other parts of the project and thought like its a very good solution to add the chat interface on top of the SignalR. Everything looks good so far. However, I think hitting the database to insert a new message EVERY time a message is being typed is not a good idea. Ive created so many strategies to implement custom donut caching in my website to make every single page as fast as possible and it seems like this would cancel all of them out What is the preferred solution to this problem I think I might take some approaches like thesep  ul liPush them to the database in batches. For instance once a message is past a threshold its datetime difference is more than X or the message count is more than Y.li liDont support offline messages, just push them inmemory to the other side through SignalR.li liSame as the 2nd, but support offline when the target user is offline. I imagine not many messages will be sent to offline usersli liDont cache anything. Ill work outli ul  pOne issue with the first one is that, there might be a situation where the website would go down for update, power failure, apocalypse, etc. and all the messages in memory would be lost. I can add a custom action to flush everything but its never quite safe. Since theres a lot of chat solutions out there, I think there are very convenient solutions to this.p

Negative 4841 pIm trying to visualize some data I have in a C form. Ive been thinking of several ways I can do this, but cant figure out what would be the best way in C.p  pFirst, let me show an example I made in paint.p  pimg srchttpwww.interstyles.nlexample.png altexamplep  pSome ways I figured I could do it p  ol lipDraw one huge picture with all data in it, and just scroll the picture in the form. This is not very nice, since the data can become quite wide. Normally Id expect to have  data thats about 36000 pixels wide, so that would be quite a huge picture so its easy to program, but takes a lot of memory.pli lipSame as one, but have a separate picture for each row of data thats only 1 pixel high, and expand it when i show it on the screen. More difficult to program, but saves a lot of memory. Also makes it easier to sort data and turn rows onoff. In short the screen gets build up by several pictures above each other.pli lipDraw only the visible data in a picture the size of the form, depending on the position of the scrollbars. More difficult to program, and I wonder if this would be fast enoughpli lipThere is also graphing capability in c, but I cant find how to make something like this.pli lipSome other library that I didnt know about yet.pli ol  pId also like if I could get information about a particular event when I hover my mousepointer over it, that would be difficult in options 1, 2 and 3.. or at least take quite some programming effort..p  pSuggestions pleasep

In order to preventing the branch prediction I jump randomly over RAM line wich are all inside the set 63  Instead of doing jumps by step of 64 I do it randomlyi dont care about others sets jmp L63  jmp L447  jmp L255  jmp L127  jmp L383  jmp L319  jmp L191  jmp L511p  pinstead of jmp L63  jmp L127  jmp L191  jmp L255  jmp L319  jmp L383  jmp L447  jmp L511p  pbut doing that will cause misprediction for each jmp doesnt itp  pconcerning outoforder, i now use mfence before rdtsc. Also i measure the time for mfencerdtsc with a program still a kernel module with interrupts disabled. you can found it at 2a hrefhttppastebin.comEQVPA3iA relnofollowhttppastebin.comEQVPA3iAa which mesure how long are these instrutions. I do this measure many time and the output of 2 give me ...56,60,60,60,60,60,60,56,60... . there is 4 cycles of difference where does it come from On average these instructions takes 58 cycle.p  pnow I start the kernel module 1 which give me  ...102,108,102,108,102,... there is 6 cycles of differenceinstead of more than 14442102 from the first version of my program but there is still a difference one time in two where does it come from on averge L1 cache access with mfencerdtsc give me 105 cycles. So without mfencerdtsc L1 cache access is 1055847 maybe because of mispredictionp

Negative 4841 pI was browsing the stackoverflow to find out the common pieces of advice regarding using jUnit for tests, but still have a couple of questions.

I believe from what Ive read that it would be better to use embedding only if my meetings had users unique to a single meeting. In my case these same users are shared across meetings. Also, although updating users would be infrequent e.g., change username, password I still feel that using a reference feels right  although Im open to opinions.p  pAssuming I went with references I have the following simplified schemap  precodevar MeetingSchema  new Schema   description      type String,     default ,     required Please fill in a description for the meeting,     trim true   ,   location      type String,     default ,     required Please fill in a location for the meeting,     trim true   ,   users [      type Schema.ObjectId,     ref User    ]   var UserSchema  new Schema     firstName          type String,         trim true,         default ,         validate [validateLocalStrategyProperty, Please fill in your first name]     ,     lastName          type String,         trim true,         default ,         validate [validateLocalStrategyProperty, Please fill in your last name]     ,     email          type String,         trim true,         default ,         validate [validateLocalStrategyProperty, Please fill in your email],         match [...., Please fill a valid email address]     ,     username          type String,         unique true,         required Please fill in a username,         trim true     ,     password          type String,         default ,         validate [validateLocalStrategyPassword, Password should be longer]       codepre  pFirst, you will notice that I dont have a collection of meetings in users.  I decided not to add this collection because I believe I could use the power of a MongoDB find to obtain all meetings associated with a specific user  i.e.,p  precodedb.meetings.findusersObjectIdx123 codepre  pOf course I would need to add some indexes.p  pNow if Im looking to deference my users for a specific meeting, how do I do that For those who understand rails and know the different between a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1208636railsincludevsjoinsinclude and joina Im looking for a similar concept.  I understand we are not dealing with joins in MongoDB, but for me in order to dereference the users collection from the meeting to get a users first and last name I would need to cycle through the collection of ids and perform some sort of a db.users.find for each id. I assume theres some easy MongoDB call I can make to get this to occur in a performant way.p
Negative 4841 pI would like to find out how to do the below, without actually doing the DB Query.. i.e. I would like to know if someData would pass whereClause without putting it in a table and asking for it back again. I.e. Run the logic inside findOne without the overhead of insert and select. Just to make it more fun, please consider that I need to have it thread safe, thats why im messing with a Guid kinda thing below.. Also please note the where clause is probably gonna be more complex than the below, like  a   ne  1   p  pGiven Sourcep  precodesomeData   a 1, b 2  whereClause   b 2  codepre  pMy code that needs fixingp  precodesomeData.GUID  ObjectId   DB QUERY  insert db.workspace.insertsomeData  whereClause.GUID  inputsValues.GUID   Check if the data passes the whereClause  DB QUERY  findOne var whereResult  db.workspace.findOnewhereClause   DB QUERY  remove db.workspace.remove GUID whereClause.GUID   if whereResult  null   alertFail else    alertPass codepre  pIn SQL what I want can be expressed kinda like this pseudo syntaxp  precodeif      Select Count from Select 1 as A, 2 as B Data where B  2 Result   1 then pass else fail codepre  pThe above query never actually touches a table  that is my main goal.p

Note I am running this app on a Tablet emulator provided by eclipse.p  pI am using this following code to implement the fragment transaction animation, the same code that I see all over the internet as the RIGHT way to do it p  precodeTipContainerFragment fragment  new TipContainerFragment FragmentManager fragmentManager  getSupportFragmentManager  FragmentTransaction transaction  fragmentManager.beginTransaction transaction.setCustomAnimationsR.anim.abcfadein, R.anim.abcfadeout transaction.replaceR.id.skilldetailcontainer, fragment  transaction.addToBackStacknull transaction.commit codepre  pI currently have this code in the SkillListActivity which is the main activity that manages both the master and the detail part of the app. I have tried putting it in the specific fragment detail part but I get the same result the fragment transaction is successful but still with no animation. Any advice or solutions would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4841 pI just cant get behind this.p  pIm writing a website in html,ajax,php,css and on chrome everything just looks fine like it should. Opening the site in firefox gives the impression that the site is zoomed in about 120. But the zoom level in firefox is at 100 and when I change it manually to 80 the website is shown correctly.p  pI tried several things like changing the layout.css.devPixelsPerPx property in firefox,checking my csscode and so on  no result. However its just my website that seems to be zoomed other sites on the web appear totally normal. Does anyone of you guys already had the same issue and knows a solution Thanks.p  pUPDATE Fixed it. I was trusting Chrome blindly. In the end the default zoom in Chrome was at 75. So Chrome was the problem. Thx anyway p

The customer selects the product from the dropdown menu then the price field is automatically populated via the dataprice attribute. I have added a button to add more products clone the row containing the product and price fields... When I do that, it still populates the dropdown menu in the added row, but the price field only automatically populates on the first row.

Negative 4841 pI have a Azure Cloud Service based HTTP API which is currently serving its data out of an Azure SQL database. We also have a in role cache at the WebRole side. p  pGenerally this model is working fine for us but sometimes what happening is that we get a large number of requests for the same resource within a short period of time span and if that resource is not there in the cache, all the requests went directly to our DB which is a problem for us as many time DB is not able to take that much load. p  pBy looking at the nature of the problem, it seems like it should be a pretty common problem which most of the people build API would face. I was thinking if somehow, I can send only 1st request to DB and hold all the remaining till the time when 1st one completes, to control the load going to DB but I did get any good of doing it. Is there any standardrecommended way of doing it in AzureIISp

Negative 4841 pIs there a common ancestor class in plsqlp  pFor example, in Java the Object class is a common ancestor for all classesp  precodeObject o o  new Stringhi ancestor           a String is an Object codepre  pBut in plsql we cant sayp  precodeo Object                                Object class doesnt exist o  new myclasshi ancestor codepre  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong The question was more theoretical than practical, just to know if plsql had a common ancestor root class for all classes, since I didnt found anything on it in the documentation. The responses have confirmed that there is not such a common class. Anyway, Im going to give some examples on how to simulate the common root class, based on the sugestions from the responses.p  pA way to do it is the trick given by Alex, by using the anydata type, that simulates the casting to a generic class. It can be useful to admit any class as parameter in functions. Example of usep  precodecreate or replace type cla as object     class      name  varchar250    declare     co  cla          cla class object     co2 cla          another one     o   anydata      Object class simulation object     ok  plsinteger  to take value returned by the recast begin     co  new clahi                 create cla object     o  anydata.convertobjectco      cast to anydata not automatic     ok  anydata.getobjecto, co2     recast to cla      dbmsoutput.putlineco.name    co.name     dbmsoutput.putlineco2.name   co2.name end codepre  pAnother way, proposed by user272735, is to simulate the common root class by creating a class that will be the parent of all of your root classes. For examplep  precodecreate or replace type obj as object     Object class simulation      oid  varchar21000  not final  create or replace type cla1  under obj   explicit inheritance      name  varchar250   create or replace type cla2  under obj   explicit inheritance      money  number6    declare     o1  cla1        cla1 class object     o1b cla1        another one     o2  cla2        cla2 class object     o2b cla2        another one     o   obj         common ancestor begin     o1  new cla11, hi           create cla1 object     o  o1                             cast to obj automatic     o1b  treato as cla1             recast to cla1      dbmsoutput.putlineo1.name    o1.name     dbmsoutput.putlineo1b.name   o1b.name      o2  new cla22, 222            create cla2 object     o  o2                             cast to obj automatic     o2b  treato as cla2             recast to cla2      dbmsoutput.putlineo2.money    o2.money     dbmsoutput.putlineo2b.money   o2b.money end codepre

Negative 4841 pI have an html page with an object tag containing an svg object.  The svg object reloads every time the display on the containing div changes from none to block.  This is causing a load event to get generated   for the svg object.  This happens in Chrome but not in Firefox.p  pIs this a bug in Chrome, or is this correct behavior  I know browsers will sometimes defer load until an element is visible, but I didnt think they should reload every time the display changes.  I know I could use visibilityhidden but this is part of a large, legacy library that has many styling dependencies and so it is not so easy to change.p  pHere is a minimal code snippet that demonstrates the problem on chrome.

Negative 4841 pI have a pandas DataFrame that has 2 columns one of the columns is a list of dates in this format 4Dec14 the other column is a list of numbers. I want to plot a graph with the dates on the xaxis and numbers that correspond with that date on the yaxis. Either a scatter plot or line graph. I was trying to follow the tutorial on Matplotlib a hrefhttpmatplotlib.orgusersrecipes.html relnofollowhttpmatplotlib.orgusersrecipes.htmla Fixing common date annoyances but it will not accept my date format. When I try using the codeplotcode function it returns an error codeValueError invalid literal for float 4Dec14code. How would I change my date format so it will work. Or is there some other way I can plot this DataFrame. Thanksp
Negative 4841 pIm making a CMS for my website and I have columns in my blogs database for whether or not the blog post is visible or not, and if comments are enabled or not.p  pAt the moment in my form Ive got p  precode            ltdiv classinputgroupgt                 ltspan classinputgroupaddongtCommentsltspangt                 ltinput typetext classformcontrol nameblogcomments idblogcomments placeholder1 or 0 required maxlength1 valueltphp echo data[blog]gtblogcommentsgtgt             ltdivgt codepre  pso if Im editing a blog it will already pull the value, otherwise itll just show the placeholder.

I guess I could just have a default value in the column of 0 and have the checkbox value to 1 I dont really like that idea though.p  pIve also no idea how to check the existing value if there is one and set the checkboxbuttonwhatever accordingly so if the value is already 1 in the column it would be checked already.

Negative 4841 pIm wondering if there is a Google Chrome Extension that allows you to select a specific portion of a webpage, much like a screen capture tool that allows you to click and drag a specific region to capture and save.  However, unlike a screen capture tool, Im wondering if theres an extension where I can select by clicking and dragging my mouse a specific region of the screen, and then only view the contents that pass through that region Ive selected.  So, when I scroll down the page, it only reveals whats in the region Ive selected, through clicking and dragging the arrow to create a rectangle or square region.  Thanks for your helpp

Negative 4841 pI am using Processing under Fedora 20, and I want to display an image of the extending tracks of objects moving across part of the screen, with each object displayed at its current position at the end of the track. To avoid having to record all the coordinates of the tracks, I usecodesaveimage.pngcode to save the tracks so far, then draw the objects. In the next frame I use codeimg  loadImageimage.pngcode to restore the tracks made so far, without the objects, which would still be in their previous positions.. I extend the tracks to their new positions, then usecodesaveimage.pngcode to save the extended tracks, still without the objects, ready for the next loop round. Then I draw the objects in their new positions at the end of their extended tracks. In this way successive loops show the objects advancing, with their previous positions as tracks behind them. p  pThis has worked well in tests where the image is the whole frame, but now I need to put that display in a corner of the whole frame, and leave the rest unchanged. I expect that codecreateImage...code will be the answer, but I cannot find any details of how to to so. p  pA similar question asked here has this recommendation The PImage class contains a save function that exports to file. The API should be your first stop for questions like this. Of course Ive looked at that a hrefhttpsprocessing.orgexamplescreateimage.html relnofollowAPIa, but I dont think it helps here, unless I have to create the image to save pixel by pixel, in which case I would expect it to slow things down a lot. p  pSo my question is in codeProcessingcode can I save and restore just part of the frame as an image, without affecting the rest of the framep

Negative 4841 pstrongContextstrongp  pI have a need to detect the collisions of high speed objects within a physics simulation. Due to the truncating of numbers from a grid and the digital representation of objects, there is a high chance that fast moving objects will pass through each other or miss. I am trying to perform an interpolative collision by emulating the properties of analog or real life motion where an object moves through every point. Objects in the real world dont normally teleport to their next point on a macro levelp  pstrongResearch and forethoughtstrong We are able to find the final and initial points of a projected object, displacement in time and velocity. I am using a per pixel collision to get a pixel map so we have a pixel cluster. Currently my approach to this problem is to use the newtons method to calculate a linear intersection.p  pstrongThe questionstrong emHow does one calculate the intersection of a pixel cluster like they would a single pixel or normal line.emp  pstrongBonusstrong what about nonlinear motion velocity with an acceleration or calculating multiple collisions within an interpolation where an elastic collision would make one of the colliding object collide with another additional object that would otherwise be moving close by, but missing, the initial collision. This is all preferably within the interpolation calculation.p

Negative 4841 pI have a moderatly complex script made up of a PS1 file that does codeImportModulecode on a number of PSM1 files, and includes a small amount of global variables that define state.p  pI have it working as a regular script, and I am now trying to implement it for Remoting, and running into some very odd issues. I am seeing a ton of .NET runtime errors with eventID of 0, and the script seems to work intermittently, with time between attempts seeming to affect results. I know that isnt a very good description of the problem, but I havent had a chance to test more deeply, and I am just wondering if I am perhaps pushing PowerShell v2 further than it can really handle, trying to do remoting with a complex and large script like this Or does this look more like something I have wrong in code and once I get that sorted I will get consistent script processing I am relatively new to PowerShell and completely new to remoting.p  pThe event data is p  blockquote   p.NET Runtime version  2.0.50727.5485  Application ErrorApplication   has generated an exception that could not be handled. Process ID0x52c   1324, Thread ID0x760 1888. Click OK to terminate the application.   Click CANCEL to debug the application.p blockquote  pWhich doesnt exactly provide anything meaningful. Also, rather oddly, if I clear the event log, it seems like I have a better chance of not having an issue. Once there are errors in the event log the chance of the script failing is much higher.  Any thoughts before I dig into troubleshooting are much appreciated. And suggestions on best practices when troubleshooting Remote scripts also much appreciated.p

Negative 4841 pI recently started experimenting with the DirectShow Examples of the BlackMagic SDK.

I think it has something to do with DirectShow interpresing i.e. 59.94i as a framerate of 29.97 and so it cant populate that framerate twice.p  pThanks in advance and sorry for any misspells  from Germany, Marcop

Negative 4841 pI am building a pseudointelligent GUI for a gimp plugin using Glade. The main part of the GUI has two frames and imports the contents using the reparent method. The main objective is to have the contents of the second frame determined by the selections made in the first frame. Eventually, the intention is to import this GUI as the content for the tabbed pages of a notebookp  pTo start with, I made a simple window, consisting of a RadioButtonBox and a ComboBox which is populated usingp  precode create the cell renderer self.cell  gtk.CellRendererText populate the default choice into the Selection  combobox self.SelectionBox  self.builder.getobjectSelectionBox self.SelectionBox.setmodelself.EditCommands self.SelectionBox.packstartself.cell, True self.SelectionBox.addattributeself.cell, text, 1 self.SelectionBox.setactive0  End populate the selection combo box section codepre  pThis works and I can successfully import and reparent the simple GUI as the first frame of the larger, more complex GUI without any problems. However, as the design progressed, it has become more convenient to have the code for the first frame as an integral part of the main GUI, and this is where my problems begin.p  pI have reproduced the contents of the simple GUI in the first frame of the larger GUI and copypasted the code from the simple GUIs stronginitstrong function. In otherwords, everything is identical.p  pUnfortunately, when I run the code I get the following errorp  precodeCDocuments and SettingsanonymousDesktopGladetutorialBatchEditMainBatchEditLibraryTab.py46 GtkWarning gtkentrysettext assertion text  NULL failed   self.SelectionBox.setactive0 codepre  pCould someone please explain what the problem isp  pThanks in advancep  pIrvinep

Negative 4841 pIn my DynamoDB table the timestamp is a GSI that I need to query on. One of the usecases is to fetch the records that lie between two dates.

Negative 4841 pThis question might be stupid but i am really curious on what is the recommended way. I am making demo rest api for my iOS app. I am iOS programmer and getting into learning php to write my own quick demo api.p  pOn one of my table i have column of type TIMESTAMP. I am sending unix timestamp value to my api that will insert that value into that column.p  pI checked database and default timestamp value format is stored like p  blockquote   p20150415 164825p blockquote  pand unix timestamp is like p  blockquote   p1430233486p blockquote  pMy API receives unix timestamp from my iOS app. Now my question is do i have to convert this timestamp that my app sends to the format that mysql saves  I need to save data in single format. One more info Sometimes if timestamp is not sent by app, then mysql inserts the current timestamp itself and this current timestamp is in format strong20150415 164825strong again.p  pMy preference is to save in traditional unix timestamp format. Is there any settingsquery that if mysql decides to store current timestamp in column than its always in strong1430233486strong format p  pNote My assumption is that TIMESTAMP type in mysql means unix TIMESTAMP. There are DATETIME type too in mysql. I may be wrong with my assumption as i can simply use INT type for storing my unix timestamps but i like the feature of mysql inserting current timestamp as default without business logic code if i dont provide any timestamp from app.p

Negative 4841 pI am currently involved in a mediumscale 300400k lines project written in Apache Wicket. At this time, majority of its source code is not really reusable, breaks a lot of wickets best practices like passing raw objects instead of models or passing whole componentspages to other components, its prone to all kinds of errors and does not handle extending functionality well. As far as Wickets documentation goes, it is great way to scratch the surface, but I can not really say its sufficient source of information for projects of this scale. What I am interested in is, how large scale applications are actually written in Wicket Are there any sourcesexamples you could recommend And as for something specific, I also have few questionsp  ul liHow to handle communication between several components Are events preferred over abstractnoop methods or vice versali liAre anonymous implementations considered bad practice How to establish a boundary on what should stay in a component and what should go into services ie. when overriding onClickli liHow to properly encapsulate component functionality, if it depends on other componentsli liHow to avoid conditional adding of componenta ie. if... add.A else addB Is there any other way around this except setting either one to visiblefalseli ul  pI would really wish to dig deeper into wicket and take few more steps to mastering it, but I feel like there is not much to learn from.p  pThank you in advance for your answers, anything will be appreciated p

Negative 4841 pheres my first SO questionp  pI use jquery datetimepicker to allow a user to easily select the date and time of an event.p  pThe HTML input field has an ajax routine that updates the database whenever the input field changes. eg  But when you drag a slider in the time picker, the field changes many times very quickly as you drag, and therefore send a whole heap of updates via AJAX when really only the the last change matters. Can I stop timepicker from updating the text field until the datetimepicker window gets closedp

This class have some parameters like person name, person second name, etc. In Person.m i have a function that calls to my rest API, retrieve all data what i need, parse JSON response, create Person objects and insert it to NSMutableArray. Here is an example of my Person.h p  precodeimport ltFoundationFoundation.hgt  interface Person  NSObject propertynonatomic, assign id delegate   property NSString  name property NSString  secondName   voidgetPersons  end codepre  pAnd Person.m filep  precodeimport Person.h import ltAFNetworking.hgt import ViewController.h  implementation Person synthesize delegate   Call this function to get all persons voidgetPersons      AFHTTPRequestOperationManager manager  [AFHTTPRequestOperationManager manager]     [manager GETwww.myApi.compersons parametersnil successAFHTTPRequestOperation operation, id responseObject          NSMutableArray allPersons  [[NSMutableArray alloc]init]          Parsing JSON response and getting array with all persons         allPersons  [self parseaJsonresponseObject]          Calling my callback function in my ViewController.m         [self.delegate callbackallPersons]      failureAFHTTPRequestOperation operation, NSError error          NSLogError , error     ]    This function will parse json response and create array with Person objects NSMutableArray parseaJsonNSDictionary jsonResponse     NSMutableArray allPersons  [[NSMutableArray alloc]init]     NSDictionary resources  [jsonResponse objectForKeyresources]      for NSDictionary jsonObject in resources          Person personObject  [[Person alloc]init]         personObject.name  [jsonObject objectForKeyname]         personObject.secondName  [jsonObject objectForKeysecondname]          [allPersons addObjectpersonObject]           return allPersons   end codepre  pAlso i have my ViewController class.

Negative 4841 pIm using the stringByReplacingMatchesInString method of NSRegularExpression to separate input strings into parts so that I can rearrange them. This was working well until I tested it against a string containing an accented .p  pHeres an XCode playground demonstrating the problem. In this cut down example its not very real world but it does demonstrate the problem, Im matching everything then creating a new string using a template which simply repeats those matches 1  1.p  precodeimport Cocoa  var err NSError var regex  NSRegularExpressionpattern ., options nil, error amperr  let test  homer simpson let r  NSMakeRange0, counttest  var str  regex.stringByReplacingMatchesInStringtest, options nil, range r, withTemplate 1  1 codepre  pThe string str ends up being homer simpso  homer simpson. As you can see, the first instance of 1 is truncated by 1 character, and Ive found that this is because of the accented . If you edit it to use a plain e, its fine.p  pBut heres the weird thing. If you edit it again to put the accented  back in the string, it behaves like it should and doesnt truncate.p  pIm inclined to suspect the range passed to the method, but I thought that count was smart enough to handle the presence of unicode charactersp
