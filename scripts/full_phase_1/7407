Positive 7407 pMy site is structured pretty typically, paths likep  precodehome homesearch categories categoriesmisc codepre  pWhat I need to happen is to have a dynamic set of prefixes put on the path and have it map to the same place, and more importantly, have that prefix kept throughout the site. The prefix wont always be there, but when its there, it needs to be kept.p  pFor example, I want codeclient1program1homecode to map to the same controller actionview as codehomecode, and if theres a link on codehomecode that references codeUrl.Contentcode or codeUrl.Actioncategoriescode, the generated URL needs to keep the codeclient1program1code prefix of the request, for example in the latter case codeclient1program1categoriescode. I need that prefix to remain on every request to maintain custom functionality for that specific clientprogram. We typically manage this with subdomains and DNS, leaving paths alone, but this particular client has compliance problems with running on multiple domains.p  pThe codeclient1code part is static and can be set in code, as those change infrequently, but the codeprogram1code part is dynamic and I need to support changes there without deploying new code.p  pIve been trying to get something working with some combination of URL rewriting, routes, or a custom VirtualPathProvider, but cant seem to get it to work. Session and cookies arent really reliable enough, as they time out and can be cleared. There would be too many places to change to try to get it consistently on the query string. p  pURL rewriting strips the path info away before the application can see it. It still needs access to read what client and program it should be displaying.p  pRoutes can get the request to the right controller, but subsequent requests from that page then ignore whatever the clientprogram was.p  pA custom codeVirtualPathProvidercode feels like the most promising direction, but the underlying physical path isnt actually changing. It seems more useful for having a separate application in another directory running in the root of a site. Changing it doesnt just change all the route and path handling, it alters the ability of the engine to find views.p  pAny suggestionsp  pstrongEditstrong Routes handle paths that go through that engine, so things like codeUrl.Actioncode work okay with routes. I have other URLs that are generated from codeUrl.Contentcode, so thats probably the question Im really asking stronghow can I change what codecode maps to in codeUrl.Contentcodestrong I think thats why I started looking at codeVirtualPathProvidercode which Im now pretty sure not at all what I need. It is more focused on mapping to local physical file paths.p

Negative 7407 pIn VS .NET, when you are selecting a folder for a project, a dialog that looks like an OpenFileDialog or SaveFileDialog is displayed, but is set up to accept only folders.  Ever since Ive seen this Ive wanted to know how its done.  I am aware of the FolderBrowserDialog, but Ive never really liked that dialog.  It starts too small and doesnt let me take advantage of being able to type a path.p  pIm almost certain by now theres not a way to do this from .NET, but Im just as curious how you do it from unmanaged code as well.  Short of completely reimplementing the dialog from scratch, how do you modify the dialog to have this behaviorp  pId also like to restate that I am aware of the FolderBrowserDialog but sometimes I dont like to use it, in addition to being genuinely curious how to configure a dialog in this manner.  Telling me to just use the FolderBrowserDialog helps me maintain a consistent UI experience but doesnt satisfy my curiosity so it wont count as an answer.p  pIts not a Vistaspecific thing either Ive been seeing this dialog since VS .NET 2003, so it is doable in Win2k and WinXP.  This is less of a I want to know the proper way to do this question and more of a I have been curious about this since I first wanted to do it in VS 2003 question.  I understand that Vistas file dialog has an option to do this, but its been working in XP so I know they did emsomethingem to get it to work.  Vistaspecific answers are not answers, because Vista doesnt exist in the question context.p  pstrongUpdate Im accepting Scott Wisniewskis answer because it comes with a working sample, but I think Serge deserves credit for pointing to the dialog customization which is admittedly nasty from .NET but it emdoesem work and Mark Ransom for figuring out that MS probably rolled a custom dialog for this task.strongp

Negative 7407 pI am developing an ASP.NET web application at work, and I keep running into the same issuep  pSometimes I want to write HTML to the page from the codebehind. For example, I have a page, Editor.aspx, with output which varies depending on the value of a GET variable, view. In other words, Editor.aspxviewapples outputs different HTML than Editor.aspxvieworanges.p  pI currently output this HTML with StringBuilder. For example, if I wanted to create a list, I might use the following syntaxp  precodemyStringBuilder.AppendLineltul ideditormenugt myStringBuilder.AppendLineltligtList Item 1ltligt myStringBuilder.AppendLineltulgt codepre  pThe problem is that I would rather use ASP.NETs List control for this purpose, because several lines of StringBuilder syntax hamper my codes readability. However, ASP.NET controls tend to output convoluted HTML, with unique IDs, inline styles, and the occasional block of inline JavaScript.p  pMy question is, is there an ASP.NET control which merely represents a generic HTML tag  In other words, is there a control like the following examplep  precodeHTMLTagControl list  new HTMLTagControlul list.ID  editormenu HTMLTagControl listItem  new HTMLTagControlli listItem.Text  List Item 1 list.AppendChildlistItem codepre  pI know there are wrappers and the such, but instead of taming ASP.NET complexity, I would rather start with simplicity from the getgo.p

Negative 7407 pI have a basic Ruby app that I am building with Sinatra, Datamapper and has user authentication using OAuth. When I receive the data back from the Oauth service, I save a record of a new user in an sqlite3 db. p  pWhat I dont know how to do is how to go about verifying the user record doesnt already exist on the user database table. I can use the users unique id uid to cross check whether the uid is already stored, but I am just unsure where to do this. p  pI have 2 classes and a strongcallbackstrong route. The strongUserstrong class is the db model, and an strongAuthenticationstrong class has assorted methods for connecting to the OAuth, and the strongcallbackstrong route which will have the Authentication.save method being called. p  pShould I be checking for an existing record within the strongAuthentication.savestrong method and return a boolean or something else Create a new method in strongAuthenticationstrong that would be like Authentication.exists and what would that look like Or should I be checking within the strongcallbackstrong routep  pI apologize if this wasnt 100 clear, I am having a difficult time describing my issue and am an absolute Ruby beginner...p
Negative 7407 pIve got trac working with mylyn in eclipse obviously through xmlrpc.  Yay for six hours of my life.  I can attach and retrieve context to tasks in trac.p  pQuestion setup I have a project checked out into two workspaces.  In workspace 1, I activate a task, open some files, edit some stuff, commit the changes to svn, and attach the context to the task.  p  pIn workspace 2, I update from svn, retrieve the context of a task and activate it.  The correct files show in the Package Explorer on the left, but the files which I left open in workspace 1 do not open automatically and the cursor isnt placed at the last edit point.p  pIs it possible to get trac working that way  I checked this test project out from svn into two different workspaces in the exact same way to test this functionality out  I read something about project names needing to be the same so I eliminated that variable.  It seems as if the way its working now is still pretty great, but it would be even better if I could get it that last step.p  pps question  I didnt setup the postcommit hooks from svn to trac yet because it seems like all they do is update ticket status for you.  Am I missing some other cool thing they can do, or maybe updating ticket status is a bigger deal than I think it isp
Negative 7407 pim wondering how i can manually start execute a controller action of my MVC application. My goal is to integrate the html output of myControllermyAction into another php application typo3 using a simple include. I thought of manually instantiating the controller, the view and the layout, to bypass the dispatcher. Sadly i cant get it working. My current approach looks like thisp  precode standard bootstrap ... setting up autoloader, database etc.  layout  new ZendLayout layoutgtsetLayoutPathapplicationdefaultlayouts layoutgtsetLayoutmain layoutgtsetContentKeycontent  view  new ZendView  controller  new IndexControllernew ZendControllerRequestHttpcurrenUrl, new ZendControllerResponseHttp controllergtview  view controllergtinit controllergthinweisAction  layoutgtcontent  viewgtrender  echo layoutgtrender codepre  pInstantiating the layout is no problem, but it becomes complicated when creating the controller. Setting the view instance after calling the constructor does not work, because the view is needed already during the instantiation.p  pWhat would be the right way for such a scenario Maybe implement a simple user defined dispatcher which uses predefined controller and action names from mep  pGreetsp  pGeorg Wchterp

Negative 7407 pIm using Sandcastle Help File Builder to build the documentation for an open source project, and Im facing two issues p  ul lipThe documentation content is in French. I set the language to French in the SHFB project, but most of the generated text is still in English Properties, Inheritance Hierarchy, See also.... I saw that there are a few localized files in the SharedContent folders which are actually not fully localized, but they allow to translate only a few things, mostly details feedback, disclaimer, privacy statement and such. strongHow can I localize the rest of the text strong Note that I have an English version of Visual Studio 2008  could that be an issue pli lipThe documentation is generated as HTML and will be hosted on an LinuxApache server. Unfortunately many filenames generated by Sandcastle have inconsistent casing, so it doesnt work on a Linux server. For instance Index.html is not considered the default document by Apache it should be index.html, and the CSS files are not found because of the wrong casing... I could fix the casing manually, but I would have to do it again every time I rebuild the documentation. strongIs there a known solution to that issue strong I guess Im not the first one to host documentation generated by Sandcastle on a Linux server, but I couldnt find any useful information about that...pli ul  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 7407 pThere is a table in our database that acts very much like a standard lookup table ID, Description.  However, this particular one is not static, the client wants the ability to add entries on the fly.  Some entries that will come prepopulated are special in that there will be code that checks for them various business rules.p  pNormally, Id create the table without autoincrementing IDs so I can be safe in the knowledge that the enum that mirrors the entries in the table always match.  Then its just a matter of checking if this objects ID matches up with the enum value Im checking for.p  pI could attempt the same approach, with IDs that dont autoincrement and an enum that only covers the entries that arent added on the fly.  We would shortly run into the issue of coming up with the next ID when the user adds a new entry.  Basically reimplementing in code the databases autoincrement feature.p  pIf I switch to using identity columns, thered be the whole issue of getting out of sync with the enum values.p  pOf course I could always match on the textual Description attribute but thats bad for obvious reasons.p  pIs there a nice way to deal with something like this  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1186736bestwaytoimplementmanytomanylookuptablewithuserentereddataThis questiona doesnt really answer it for me.p

Negative 7407 pI receive a daily XML file that contains thousands of records, each being a business transaction that I need to store in an internal database for use in reporting and billing. I was under the impression that each days file contained only unique records, but have discovered that my definition of unique is not exactly the same as the providers. p  pThe current application that imports this data is a C.Net 3.5 console application, it does so using SqlBulkCopy into a MS SQL Server 2008 database table where the columns exactly match the structure of the XML records. Each record has just over 100 fields, and there is no natural key in the data, or rather the fields I can come up with making sense as a composite key end up also having to allow nulls. Currently the table has several indexes, but no primary key.p  pBasically the entire row needs to be unique. If one field is different, it is valid enough to be inserted. I looked at creating an MD5 hash of the entire row, inserting that into the database and using a constraint to prevent SqlBulkCopy from inserting the row,but I dont see how to get the MD5 Hash into the BulkCopy operation and Im not sure if the whole operation would fail and roll back if any one record failed, or if it would continue.p  pThe file contains a very large number of records, going row by row in the XML, querying the database for a record that matches all fields, and then deciding to insert is really the only way I can see being able to do this. I was just hoping not to have to rewrite the application entirely, and the bulk copy operation is so much faster.p  pDoes anyone know of a way to use SqlBulkCopy while preventing duplicate rows, without a primary key Or any suggestion for a different way to do thisp

My question is how does my Bitmap data get into the WebView Do I have to write it to a file first, which I would have to remove again later, or is there an easier wayp  pOr are there even better ways to accomplish my main goal, which is displaying Bitmap data as zoomable and panable imagesp

Negative 7407 pHow would I prevent the browser from opening the pop up window that was displayed from the previous page when the user clicks the back buttonp  pI hope that made sense but Ill explain it in point form belowp  pThere are three pages Page1, Page2, Page3p  ol lipUser loads Page1 and clicks a link to load Page2 in a new window using JavaScript i.e. window.open....

Negative 7407 pIm starting to think about and develop an architecture for a big web application, and I wanted to get suggestions andor recommendations on which technologies andor frameworks to use.p  pThe application will be an Intranetbased web site using Windows authentication, running on IIS and using ASP.NET.  Itll need to be structured as a main web application with subweb applications.  Essentially, the entire scope is a composite browserbased, Intranet application that is composed of discrete, functionally complete modules or subapplications.p  pThis composite web client application would have a main or shell module to provide the overall user interface structure.  Additionally, the shell module would provide access to common services that all the individual subapps or modules could use.  Then each subappmodule would contain its own functionality and implementation, but integrate with the shell user interface.p  pNext, based on the user and which of the subapps are available, the main or shell app would dynamically build tabs or buttons or something as a way to access each individual application.  And, well be storing the user and application data in a database table.p  pSo, for example, were going to have a reports application, a display application, and probably a couple other distinct applications.  On startup of the mainshell application, after determining who the user is, the main app will query the database to determine which subapps the user can use and build out the UI.  Then the user can navigate between available subapps and do their work in each.p  pI hope all this makes sense.p  pAnyway, Im wondering which, if any, preexisting technologiesframeworks would work best for architecting and developing a system such as this.p  pWould the Web Client Software Factory be a good choice Would some other MVP solution be a good choice Would ASP.NET MVC be a good choice Something else Would none of these be a good choice and we should just develop everything from the ground up using web forms Any other info I should know aboutp  pThanksp

Im ignoring return values for clarity  production code would check them. Specifically, I need to read in many potentially 10s to 100s of millions 2byte 16bit ushort integer data samples fixed format, no parsing required stored in binary in a disk file. The nice thing about the C way is that it reads the samples directly into the uint16  buffer with no CPU involvement, and no copying. Yes, it is potentially unsafe, as it uses void  pointers to buffers of unknown size, but it seems like there should be a safe .NET alternative.p  pWhat is the best way to accomplish this in C I have looked around, and come across a few hints unions using FieldOffset, unsafe code using pointers, Marshalling, but none seem to quite work for this situation, wout using some sort of copyingconversion. Id like to avoid BinaryReader.ReadUInt16, since that is very slow and CPU intensive. On my machine there is about a 25x difference in speed between a for loop with ReadUInt16, and reading the bytes directly into a byte[] array with a single Read. That ratio could be even higher with nonblocking IO overlapping useful processing while waiting for the disk IO.p  pIdeally, I would want to simply disguise a ushort[] array as a byte[] array so I could fill it directly with Read, or somehow have Read fill the ushort[] array directlyp  precode DOES NOT WORK public void GetDataFileStream f, ushort [] buf, int startsamp, int nsamps      f.Position  startsampsizeofushort     f.Readbuf, 0, nsamps  codepre  pBut there is no Read method that takes a ushort[] array, only a byte[] array.p  pCan this be done directly in C, or do I need to use unmanaged code, or a thirdparty library, or must I resort to CPUintensive samplebysample conversion Although safe is preferred, I am fine with using unsafe code, or some trick with Marshal, I just have not figured it out yet.p  pThanks for any guidancep  hr  p[UPDATE]p  pI wanted to add some code as suggested by dtb, as there seem to be precious few examples of ReadArray around.

Negative 7407 pI am dealing with a concept for a project that involes absolutely critical data.p  pThe most important part is that it needs to be stored encrypted.p  pAn encrypted file system that is mounted from which the webserver serves the files is not enough.p  pThe key to decrypt the data should be passed in the request URI on a secured connection along with a hash and a timestamp.p  pThe hash, based on timestamp, key and filename validates the URI and stores it on a list, so it can only be accessed once.p  pThe important part now is that the webserver should take the file from the disk, and serve it decrypted using they key he got from the request URI.p  pIt should also be efficient and fast. This also requires an encryption method that does not require the whole file to be scanned. so that the file can progressively be decrypted. I think AES can do this with specified block sizes that are encrypted atomic.p  pSo one option would be reading the source file into a php script in chunks of some megs where i decrypt using aes and print the decrypted content. The script then forgets the previous data and continues with the next chunk until eof.p  pIf aes doesnt support that i can just encrypt chunks of defined size of the file seperately, concatenate them and do it the same when serving the files. however i would like to stick to one standard that i dont have to re invent, so i can also use standard libraries to encrypt the files.p  pHowever this will be very inefficient. p  pDo you know of any apachelighttpdnginx module or some better methodp

Negative 7407 pEmacs is officially named a text editor but used by many as an operation system. More precisely, Emacs can be described as an Lispinterpreter and an environment for developing interactive applications. It has a clientserver architecture and a sheer overwhelming amount of well documented functionality. As a Lispinterpreter, it is extremely configurable too. p  pHowever, besides all this merits, I never heard about commercial or lets say high load clientserver applications based on Emacs. It seems to be used mainly by highly skilled individuals with ITmath background.

Negative 7407 pI wondered if FileOutputStream.writebyte[] is always blocking the current thread, leading to a ThreadContext switch, or can it be that this operation does not block if the OS buffers are large enought to handle the bytes.p  pThe reason for these thoughts are, I wondered if the logging I do with log4j in my application is a real performance hit, and if it would be faster to use a Queue of logging messages which is read by a separate thread and written to the logfiles I know the disadvantages of swallowed logging statement if the app quits and the statements in the queue are not flushed to disk.p  pNo, I didnt profile it yet, these are rather conceptual thoughts.p

Negative 7407 pI have a webpage aimed at mobile devices e.g. iPhone amp Android. This page has an codeltiframegtcode that obviously includes another webpage to render. On the iPhone the page and the iframe render OK. I have set the codeltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth gtcode, which should make it set the viewport width to about 320ish or whatever safari uses now. However the content in my iframe is wider than 320ish pixels wide.p  pThis causes a problem because the iframe is truncated. The iPhone web browser only displays the left hand side of the iframe content. Since I have codewidthdevicewidthcode, I am unable to scrollpan left or right to see the rest of the content. I am also unable to zoom outin to give myself more screen room.p  pI can get around this problem by setting a wide viewport e.g. codewidth800code, which ensures that the iframe is visible. But a the rest of the page looks worse since its all wider than it should be and b Im not sure I can rely on it always fitting within 800 px, so I cant be sure this will fix everything.p  pIs there anyway to ensure that the contents of the iframe will always be seen, and preferably, keen the codewidthdevicewidthcodep  pFTR Im using a iPhone 3.

Im learning python from a hrefhttpopenbookproject.netthinkcspythonenglish3eindex.html relnofollowhttpopenbookproject.netthinkcspythonenglish3eindex.htmla  and everything had been quite nice until now, where I just got stuck for hours.

After some debugging I found out  that the problem occurs when the program checks if the given card is present in the deckhandetc.  It cant ever make a match.  Then after some looking back on the chapter, in ch16, I found out that if card in deckhandetc removecard etc looks up the .strongcmpstrong of the object to determine if the card actually exists in the deckhandetc.  This is my version of the strongcmpstrong after doing the additions for aces on the given code from the ebook.p  precodedef cmpself, other      Compares cards, returns 1 if greater, 1 if lesser, 0 if equal       check the suits     if self.suit gt other.suit return 1     if self.suit lt other.suit return 1      suits are the same... check ranks      check for aces first.     if self.rank  1 and other.rank  1 return 0     if self.rank  1 and other.rank  1 return 1     if self.rank  1 and other.rank  1 return 1      check for nonaces.     if self.rank gt other.rank return 1     if self.rank lt other.rank return 1      ranks are the same... its a tie     return 0 codepre  pThe strongcmpstrong itself seems fine afaik, ofc I could use some tips on how to make it better like with ace checks.

Negative 7407 pI have a WPF program with two listviews which display information from two different observable collections. These observable collections are updated on a timer which fires every second.p  pFor some reason, these listviews do not update when the data collection is updated... they will update occasionally but there is no guarantee that it will ever happen. I can run the whole program for 10 minutes and have nothing displayed... There are no databinding errors in the output window, either. In fact, if I populate the collection during startup, to test the binding, it is all displayed without problems. Its only when I am adding items dynamically during the execution of the program that there is a problem.p  pWhen trying to debug it is impossible to follow the program because for some reason Ive got a whole load of worker threads running which I never defined or asked forp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comwq5ND.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comwq5ND.pngap  pI think these extra threads might be part of the problem.

So I want to reload Page1 whenever page2 updates the database. I thought of just using setTimeoutsomething, timeInterval in Page1 but it doesnt seem appropriate since the components of Page1 are flickering everytime it reloads. I want Page1 to reload if and only if there are changes in my database. I also thought of just putting the Page1s function inside an infinite while loop but it doesnt seem appropriate either, since the page just loads..p  pAnother thing is, I was informed about JSON and REST. So I could just access the database from the script file. But Im not that knowledgeable in it. Neither am I in jQuery.p  pIve tried searching about refreshing a page from another but the answers I found were either vague or difficult for me. And my pages have the same name, they only differ with the user logged in. But If I can find a way to do this, then Ill just do something with my pages names.p  pIs there any other way I can do this Thank you.p

Negative 7407 pMy question is related to many existing questions concerning handling WebView after orientation change.p  pI know that the activity is than destroyed, so I use onSaveInstanceState to save its state and later I restore it with restoreState.p  pAnd this works fine most of the time. But it doesnt when I change the orientation too quickly  immediately after starting my activity or creating WebView object after return from different layout. Debugging shows that my WebView state gets saved and that all the objects are already created and prepared when the orientation change occurs and it tries to restore the state but somehow it cannot. There are no errors of any kind but the page is never loaded, I see infinite white screen. Calling WebView.reload also doesnt help.p  pAny idea why this happens As I said, all the object are created at the time of orientation change and loadUrl method was called, so the state should be saved correctly. p

Negative 7407 pI am working on a project that uses hibernate and spring. Hibernate is encapsulated in a DAO layer and the DAO layer has corresponding service layer as well, theres also the controllers that is mapped for requests and JSP pages. I was told not to pass objects between these layers Controllers lt Service lt DAO as it is performance overhead. One particular instance was when I needed to update a boolean value in a domain object ORM class, I wrote a method that passed the domain object between Service layer and DAO layer, and I was told to pass the object ID and the particular boolean value only and to write separate methods in the layers for that. Is this right I feel doing so will invalidate many advantages of using an ORM tool Hibernate. Am I wrong to think this Any advice and insights will be useful.... p
Negative 7407 pstrongSOLVEDstrong  the problem is that doing a rotation puts half of the element behind the neutral zero Zaxis for the webpage, and WebKit apparently doesnt allow mouse events through that neutral plane. So changing the rotation point to the rightleft edges of the panels solved it. Weird but for now it works.p  pI have a simple HTML5CSS3 page with four panels. These panels use webkittransform to form them into a nice arrangement. On hover, I use webkittransform to bring the panel up to the foreground. The code is below.p  pWhat happens is that the hover action is unreliable. If I swipe the mouse over the panels, its common to stop moving the mouse with it hovering over a panel but the panel is still in its original position. Specifically, swiping from left to right, the leftmost two panels appear to work fine, but the rightmost two dont scale up until the mouse is halfway across the panel.p  pWhat would cause thisp  pEDIT Quick followup, it appears that links placed in the transformed elements will only be clickable on the leftmost for the two left panels or rightmost for the two right panels halves of the elements. In other words, the click zone is only active for the closer half of the element.p  pFirst, the HTML minimal examplep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt ltheadgt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hreftest.css gt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltsection idtestgt     ltarticle classtrleftgtltarticlegt     ltarticle classtrmidleftgtltarticlegt     ltarticle classtrmidrightgtltarticlegt     ltarticle classtrrightgtltarticlegt ltsectiongt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pAnd the CSSp  precodetest article      display inlineblock     height 150px     width 160px     backgroundcolor blue     webkittransition webkittransform 0.2s ease   test article.trleft      webkittransform perspective400px rotateY20deg scale1   test article.trmidleft      webkittransform perspective400px rotateY8deg scale0.9   test article.trmidright      webkittransform perspective400px rotateY8deg scale0.9   test article.trright      webkittransform perspective400px rotateY20deg scale1   test articlehover, test articleactive      webkittransform perspective400px scale1.2  codepre

Negative 7407 pI have a VB.NET application. When strongTexterstrong or strongPhraseExpressstrong is installed and enabled, the program behaves poorly. Debugging has revealed that at times I can press Enter in a field and no event will be fired i.e. no breakpoints in the event handlers get hit, then I press it again, and they will be fired twice. Basically these cycle if I keep pressing enter  one time nothing will happen, the next I get two events, the next keypress does nothing, the next triggers two events, etc.p  pSince Enter is used in certain places to trigger searches, or to move between fields for fast data entry using the numeric keypad, this effectively breaks the program in these spots.p  pThe problem is highly repeatable  disabling Texter or PhraseExpress causes the program behaves perfectly normally. Enabling them again causes it to break.p  pNote that in both text expansion programs, I have assigned NO events to the Enter key. In fact, with Texter havent done this particular test with PE yet, it happens even if NO replacements have been defined at all, simply based on whether Texter is enable or disabled.p

What is seen is that the field codekeyhashcode is stored, we call libc codeputscode and then codekeyhashcode is loaded. If codeputscode is removed, the constant is correctly propagated.

Negative 7407 pstrongIn briefstrong  p  pSuppose an codeintcode type field in my table contains any binary four digit number combination of 0s and 1s, e.g. 1010, 0110 etc.. How do I selectively update only some of those digits without changing the others.p  pstrongDetailsstrongbr I have a codeuserrelevancecodecode field in my codepermissionscode table which is of type codeint10code which stores four digits which represents which account types this particular permission is relevant to. These four digits store a 1 or 0 each meaning whether or not it is relevant. From left to right, the relevance to these account types  codeManagercode, codePublishercode, codeAdvertisercode, codeDevelopercode is stored. So, a value code0110code stored in this field would mean it is relevant to Managers, Publishers and not relevant to Advertisers. p  pNow, at any point of time, suppose I need to mark some of these permissions as relevant to managers, or make them relevant to advertisers and publishers and at the same time make them not relevant to managers, and all such random operations. For all such cases, I need to keep the other digits untouched. This means, if I need to update the manager relevance digit only, I should not touch the publisher and advertiser digits.p  pstrongProblemstrongbr It is obvious that I need to do binary OR of the code I need to apply with the current value of codeuserrelevancecodecode and store it, but this is not working for me.p  pFor the operation of making some permissions relevant to publishers, I tried this query  p  precodeupdate permissions set userrelevancecode  0100  userrelevancecode where ltcondition to update some permissionsgt codepre  pBut this did not produce desired results. Those records which were having code1000code earlier, got updated to code1004code, where I wanted them to become code1100code update only the 2nd digit to 1 and leave others as they are.p  pI also tried changing the type of that field to codebinarycode.

If I watch the same videos directly through YouTube then the videos load quickly and play smoothly. p  pCould it be the youtubeplaylist script that is causing the slow down Or, could it be the fact that I am loading the video in at a custom size p  pAlso, does YouTube give preference to the videos played directly on their sitep
Negative 7407 pOn my jsp page I have a loop that loops elements in a collection, which create dynamic fields.  Each iteration creates a field type called editType and names it as editType1, editType2...p  pThere are 3 possible options for editType.  Based on what the user choosese for editType, I need to hide the irrelevant fields and only show the fields that pertain to the editType that they have chosen.  For each editType option there is a cooresponding tbody named editTypeA, editTypeB and editTypeC.  An example is if editType  A then tbody name EditTypeA should show and EditType B and EditTypeC should be hidden.  Since the tbody for each edity type will be created each time in the loop, how can I have the jquery function display the appropriate tbody for just the clicked editType field and not for all the editType fields on the page.  p  pThe jsp page looks likep  precode ltcforEach itemssurveyInfo.allSurveyEdits varsurveyEdits varStatusstatusgt                                            lttr

Negative 7407 pThis is Oracle 11.2.0.3.p  pWeve got a problem where we use Oracles JMS over OracleAQ.  This works fine except we started noticing the queue getting filled with 1000s, then millions of messages over time.  Some of these are in the PROCESSED state, but most are READY.  We traced down this behavior to zombie or dead subscribers to the topic.  When a Java process is terminated and doesnt get the chance to unregister itself, it leaves the subscriber record in the queue and ORacle doesnt seem to detect that it is dead.  So much so that MONTHS later, a new message sent into our multisubscriber queue will then get multiplied by the  of subscribers, which it thinks is much higher than it actually is.  We first noticed this when we reached the maximum subscriber limit.p  pWeve got the qmon processes running  I even tried increasing the minimum  of processes to no effect.  The queue cleanup happens really nicely as long as there are no dead subscribers in the queue.p  pAnyone see this before, and hopefully found a solutionp

Negative 7407 pSo heres the situation, I have to develop a multiplayer game using c in unix. Now i created the sockets and the server and client are communicating ok. Now this game includes a board, so each client has its own 2d array of 100x40, and they are sending the x and y position using the readwrite which is working ok too to the server.p  pNow, in the server, Im using fork so that new clients can join the game. In the childs section, Im receiving the x and y position. Now my question is, how can I store the x and y position to a global board[100][40] found in the server so I may check for collisions etc. The difficulty Im finding is that each child is having its own version of the board since Im using fork, and Im only updating the board of that particular child. I would like that each time the client sends it x and y position, I place them in the board found in server. p  pIve read that I would need to use some sort of IPC, like shared memory, but cant figure it out. If anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated, Thanks.p

Negative 7407 pI am using Coda 2 and MAMP Pro. Many sites I have built work great with the pair, and when it works, it works. By allowing me to specify a SiteSpecific URL and then letting Coda know what that URL is, the preview feature works fantastic. Until I started using CakePHP...p  pThe problem is that say I specify the URL myawesomesite and point it to my local site directory in MAMP Pro, and then run the servers. I can navigate to httpmyawesomesite8888 and everything works great, even on sites using CakePHP. However, when I click preview in Coda, even after specifying the correct Local URL, Coda tries to append the file structure as it should in most cases to the URL. Meaning that I get a URL like this httpmyawesomesite8888appViewPassesindex.ctpp  pIs there any way to override the normal URL formatting of Coda 2s preview function Or any other solutionsp
Negative 7407 pI have created a public facing website which allows you to login using a usernamepassword, or with Twitter, or with Facebook.p  pWhen logging in with Twitter for the first time for example, a user is created in my database with a nickname matching the Twitter screen name. I want this nickname to strongalwaysstrong be unique.p  pThe problem is that in some cases a user with that nickname already exists, so the user cant be added. I am unsure as to the accepted approach for this problem, the only solution I can see so far is to ask the user to override their nickname, but this doesnt seem too elegant.p  pThe reason the nickname needs to be unique is not a code issue, but an interface issue, for example there are forums and I want each user to be uniquely identified by their nickname.p  pAre there any other methods anyone can suggest for dealing with this problem p  hr  pEdit At the request of some of the replies I will clarify an examplep  pLets say I have a user named Joe Bloggs who is a member on my website. He is not a member of Twitter or Facebook. His nickname on my site is JoeBloggs.p  pThen, another Joe Bloggs comes along, and wants to sign in with his Twitter account. His Twitter name is JoeBloggs, so when he signs in with Twitter, my system attempts to automatically set his nickname to JoeBloggs. However, this nickname already exists. What is the normal or best practice in the cases where nicknames like this overlap The only thing I can think of is to prompt the user to specify a different and unique nickname just for display on my site.p  pThe reason I ask is that this must be a common issue for sites which let you login via Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo  there must be an overlap in the names which are returned from said websites, so I wondered what the normal process is.p

Negative 7407 pNot so recently Ive published a game that is written entirely in Java on Android platform. Currently Im trying to get as much of the performance as possible. It seems that the problem in my games case is that Im using more too often codeArrayListcode container in places where codeMapcode could be better suited. To explain myself I did it because I was afraid of dynamic memory allocations that would be triggered behind the scene codeMapcodecodeTreecode structures on Android. Maybe there is some sort of structure on AndroidJava platform I dont know about, which will provide me with fast searching results and additionally will not allocate dynamically extra memory when adding new elementsp  pUPDATE For example Im using an ArrayList structure for holding most of my games Particles. Of course removing them independently not sequentially is a pain in the bt as the system needs to iterate through the whole container just to remove one entity object of course in the worst case scenario.p

Negative 7407 pI am planning to use codelog4netcode in a new web project. In my experience, I see how big the log table can get, also I notice that errors or exceptions are repeated. For instance, I just query a log table that have more than 132.000 records, and I using distinct and found that only 2.500 records are unique 2, the others 98 are just duplicates. so, I came up with this idea to improve logging.p  pHaving a couple of new columns codecountercode and codeupdateddtcode, that are updated every time try to insert same record.p  pIf want to track the user that cause the exception, need to create a codeuserlogcode or loguser table, to map NN relationship.p  pCreate this model may made the system slow and inefficient trying to compare all these long text... Here the trick, we should also has a codehash columncode of binary of 16 or 32, that hash the message and the exception, and configure an index on it. We can use a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms174415.aspx relnofollowcodeHASHBYTEScodea to help us. I am not an expert in DB, but I think that will made the faster way to locate a similar record. And because hashing doesnt guarantee uniqueness, will help to locale those similar record much faster and later compare by message or exception directly to make sure that are unique.p  pThis is a theoreticalpractical solution, but will it work or bring more complexity what aspects I am leaving out or what other considerations need to have the trigger will do the job of insert or update, but is the trigger the best way to do itp

Negative 7407 pI have a very complex problem at least i think so implementing a custom module in Magento. I have created a module that displays products of a single main category in default catalog. For example,p  precoderoot catalog   main category      cat 1      cat 2        sub category 1      cat 3 codepre  pSo what i need to do is, display all these categories in a drop down list and when you select any one category all its products will be loaded. Seemed pretty strait forward. I added the code to display this sort by category drop down list in my modules list.phtml file. Instead of loading default product collection I loaded the bmain categoryb and then fetched all its sub category and populated the drop down list. And I fetched the product collection of the selected category from the drop down list. My code is like thisp  precodebaseCategory  MagegetModelcatalogcategorygtload62 productCollection  baseCategorygtgetProductCollectiongtaddAttributeToSelect codepre  pThe products are loaded alright but the problem arises with pagination. the code for pagination goes like thisp  precodethisgtgetToolbarHtml codepre  pI have used the bthisgetToolbarHtmlb instead of bthisb so in pagination also I need to change the object. Its not working due to that I think. The toolbar is shown but regardless of number of products per page selected it always displays all products. Can anyone tell me please how to get the toolbar working with my changed code in list.phtml file p

Negative 7407 pWhat is the best way to store metadata that describe a collection in MongoDBp  pI have a collection with an arbitrary and changing number of documents within.  As I create new documents, I want to assign a new, temporary name String based on the number of documents currently in the collection, e.g. Doc 1, Doc 2, ...  Since documents could be removed, just doing a count will not yield a useful result.p  pOne option is to store metadata describing a collection within a different collection, but this seems awkward.p  pSince Mongo is schemafree, I could keep the collections metadata within the collection itself, perhaps within a document with the name metadata.  In that case, how would I access that document quickly  Would I need to build an index for metadata to get at it immediately, without On search timep  pIs there a more standard, or simpler, way than what I described in the previous paragraph  I may end up with more metadata in the future than just a count.p

In theory, for every whole number that is scrolled scrollTop, the background image changes accordingly. p  pAll the images are basically named imgname1.jpg, imgname2.jpg, imgname3.jpg etc. So the imgname is paired with the scrollTop number. p  pAnd here is what I have regarding only the scrolling not the preload p  precodefunction getPos      var Pos  window.scrollTop   Pos  scrollTop and is added onto imgname return Pos    function   window.scrollfunction  Defines that this function will be triggered as the scrollbar is moving       var imageurl  httpwww.examplehost.comimgname  Pos  .jpg      if getPosgt1  If the vertical position of scrollbar is above 1 display imgname  Pos  .jpg ex imgname30.jpg and add to url          body.cssbackgroundimage, imageurl                                        else  If the vertical position of scrollbar is at 1 display start image         body.cssbackgroundimage, urlhttpwww.examplehost.comimgname0.jpg          function ends codepre  pI dont know how much of a mess that is and yes Ill be brushing up on the basics, since it is logical in my mind but completely wrong Im sure.

Negative 7407 pI am trying to undock a JPanel in a JFrame in such a way that i can move the JPanel seperated from the JFrame when it is undocked. The problem im encountering is that the JMenuBar that im using disappears when i focus on the undocked JPanel. Im currently using a JDialog for undocking the JPanel. The disappearing of the JMenuBar is because of the JDialog, because when using mac osx, the JMenuBar on the top of the screen is not available for JDialogs.p  pDoes anyone have any idea how the undocking can be done different in such a way that i can keep the JMenuBar, or maybe even fixing the problem that im havingp  pHere are pictures to give the visual idea with the problem.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com945dr.png altenter image description herep  pIn the second picture, the JMenuBar in the top disappeared.

Negative 7407 pIn Processing 2 I am currently creating a Java class diagram in a UMLish sort of style. Classes, Interfaces and the like are represented as rectangles, created using processings coderectcode method. A class is created for each rectangle to be displayed storing information about it, with a codedisplaycode method which draws the rect.p  pIn order to implement zooming in and out of this diagram to facilitate very large or very small projects, I have added code which changes a codescalecode variable each time the mousewheel is scrolled in and out. The code then uses Processings codescalecode method each time the class rectangles, etc, are drawn.p  pI am also attempting to detect when one of these rectangles is moused over. This is currently done with the following code inside the class representing a rectanglep  precodeChecks to see if a mouse X and Y posX and posY position is inside the rectangle.         public boolean positionCollidesint posX, int posY          boolean xCollides  false, yCollides  false          ifcentreX  width2 gt posX ampamp centreX  width2 lt posX             xCollides  true                   ifcentreY  height2 gt posY ampamp centreY  height2 lt posY         yCollides  true                   ifxCollides ampamp yCollides             return true                  else             return false                codepre  pWhere codemouseXcode and codemouseYcode are fed into that method. Note in this code codecentreXcode and codecentreYcode are variables which contained the coordinates of the centre of the rectangle when it was first created.p  pHowever, when I zoom in and the scaling is applied to the rectangles codedisplaycode method, the mousing over breaks  presumably because the things are displayed at slightly different X and Y coordinates and its still checking the old ones.p  pIs there a way I can change my above codepositionCollidescode method to help it deal with the result of the scaling How can I get this sortedp  pIve attempted to sort this by putting the code which calls codepositionCollidescode after the codescalecode call in the display method in an attempt to get the mouseX and mouseY values to scale as well, and by multiplying mouseX and mouseY by the scale ie 0.9, 1.1 to try and get them to the correct values.p  pPerhaps theres a way I can alter the objects centreX and centreY dynamicallyp  pThanks for reading my wall of text.p  pstrongtldrstrong  How can I detect if the mouse pointer is inside a shaperectangle which has been scaled in Processingp

So please do not killing me for implementing an answering machine.p  pstrongUPDATE 15.11.2012strongp  pI figure out that codeMapKeyname  datecode does the trick. But this doesnt solves the hole problem. JPA just support the codeCollectioncode and the codeMapcode interface. With hibernates codeSortcode I can use codeSortedMapcode. But the least common interface is codeNavigableMapcode TreeMap. So I stuck again.p

Negative 7407 pIve been reading some JSON tutorials and the structure and syntax makes sense to me.. but I am trying to do a project that requires me to do a GET, and it seems to be implying that I can do that with JSON.p  pIve read that JSON and AJAX can be compared pretty well, so I would assume that this is possible. If I could be directed towards some reading about how to use JSON in this manner, or have it explained, I would be very grateful.p  pThanksp  pEdit Please reopen this... The fact that it was closed in the first place is appalling. There was a perfectly legitimate discussion going. And not ONE of the people who closed it bothered adding anything.p

Negative 7407 pIm new to JavaEE starting today. Im reading a book and doing example simultaneously. At first I wrote a very simple program that takes users information in index.jsp via a form, and then shows them in output.jsp. Then I tried to convert it to MVCbased architecture, using Beans as the Model. So, users data first goes to a servlet called ControllerServlet.java, data is SET in the Bean, and in the view output.jsp data is GET from the bean. But it gives me errors, regarding incorrect use of Beans.p  pHere is my codep  pindex.jspp  precode    lt      Document    index     Created on  Dec 8, 2012, 41648 PM     Author      mohsen gt  ltpage contentTypetexthtml pageEncodingUTF8gt ltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt     ltheadgt         ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetUTF8gt         lttitlegtDeveloper surveylttitlegt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         lth1gtWelcome to SHITlth1gt         ltpgtPlease indicate shit, so we could be able to do further shit later.ltpgt         ltform actionoutput.jspgt             lttable border0gt                 lttbodygt                     lttrgt                         lttdgtFull Namelttdgt                         lttdgtltinput typetext namefullName value gtlttdgt                     lttrgt                     lttrgt                         lttdgtJavalttdgt                         lttdgtltinput typecheckbox nameprogLang valueJava gtlttdgt                     lttrgt                     lttrgt                         lttdgtGroovylttdgt                         lttdgtltinput typecheckbox nameprogLang valueGroovy gtlttdgt                     lttrgt                     lttrgt                         lttdgtScalalttdgt                         lttdgtltinput typecheckbox nameprogLang valueScala gtlttdgt                     lttrgt                     lttrgt                         lttdgtClttdgt                         lttdgtltinput typecheckbox nameprogLang valueC gtlttdgt                     lttrgt                     lttrgt                         lttdgtRubylttdgt                         lttdgtltinput typecheckbox nameprogLang valueRuby gtlttdgt                     lttrgt                     lttrgt                         lttdgtlttdgt                         lttdgtltinput typesubmit valueSubmit gtlttdgt                     lttrgt                 lttbodygt             lttablegt          ltformgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pHere is SurveyData.java the Beanp  precode   To change this template, choose Tools  Templates   and open the template in the editor.    import java.beans. import java.io.Serializable       author mohsen   public class SurveyData implements Serializable       public static final String PROPSAMPLEPROPERTY  sampleProperty     private String fullName     private String[] progLang     private PropertyChangeSupport propertySupport      public SurveyData          propertySupport  new PropertyChangeSupportthis           public String getFullName          return fullName           public String[] getProgLang          return progLang           public void setProgLangString[] value          String[] oldValue  progLang         progLang  value         propertySupport.firePropertyChangePROPSAMPLEPROPERTY, oldValue, progLang           public void setFullNameString value          String oldValue  fullName         fullName  value         propertySupport.firePropertyChangePROPSAMPLEPROPERTY, oldValue, fullName           public void addPropertyChangeListenerPropertyChangeListener listener          propertySupport.addPropertyChangeListenerlistener           public void removePropertyChangeListenerPropertyChangeListener listener          propertySupport.removePropertyChangeListenerlistener       codepre  pHere is ControllerServlet.javap  precode   To change this template, choose Tools  Templates   and open the template in the editor.    import java.io.IOException import java.io.PrintWriter import javax.servlet.ServletException import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse       author mohsen   WebServletname  ControllerServlet, urlPatterns  ControllerServlet public class ControllerServlet extends HttpServlet              Processes requests for both HTTP       ltcodegtGETltcodegt and       ltcodegtPOSTltcodegt methods.             param request servlet request       param response servlet response       throws ServletException if a servletspecific error occurs       throws IOException if an IO error occurs           protected void processRequestHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response             throws ServletException, IOException          SurveyData surveyData  new SurveyData         surveyData.setFullNamerequest.getParameterfullName         surveyData.setProgLangrequest.getParameterValuesprogLang         request.setAttributesurveyData, surveyData          request.getRequestDispatcheroutput.jsp.forwardrequest, response             lteditorfold defaultstatecollapsed descHttpServlet methods.

Negative 7407 pI like and use the Yii framework, particularly its components, which are lazilyinstantiated and you can swap them in or out in your configuration file.  Kind of like a dependency injectionlite.  p  pI try to keep the business logic of my code completely independent of the Framework, in case I ever want to repurpose that code, or even change frameworks.  p  pLets say I have a class in my service layer called AccountService, which implements IAccountService and has a oneargument constructor.p  precodeinterface IAccountService    function getUserByIdid   class AccountService implements IAccountService    private userRepository    public function constructIUserRepository userRepository      thisgtuserRepository  userRepository       public function getUserByIdid      return thisgtuserRepositorygtgetByIdid     codepre  pGreat.

Im not really happy with any of them they both look overengineered and Im detecting a distinct smell from them.p  pstrongOption 1  composestrong  I create a class called AccountServiceComponent which implements Yiis IApplicationComponent.  It cannot extend my AccountService class, because of the constructor, but it could instantiate one as a private member and wrap all of its methods, like sop  precodeclass AccountServiceComponent implements IApplicationComponent, IAccountservice    private accountService    public construct      thisgtaccountService  new AccountServicenew UserRepository       public getUserByIdid      return thisgtaccountServicegtgetUserByIdid     codepre  pstrongConsstrong Ill have to wrap emeveryem method like that, which is tedious and could lead to baklava code.  Especially considering that therell be multiple service classes, each with multiple methods.p  pstrongOption 2  mixinstrong Or behavior or trait or whatever its called these days.p  pYii having been written prior to PHP 5.4 offers behaviors in the form of a class which implements IBehavior.  I could create a behavior class which extends my service, and attach it to a componentp  precodeclass AccountServicesBehavior extends AccountService implements IBehavior     Implement the few required methods here   class AccountServiceComponent implements IApplicationComponent    public function construct      accountService  new AccountServicenew UserRepository     thisgtattachBehavioraccountService  codepre  pstrongConsstrong My component no longer officially implements IAccountService.  Also seems to be getting excessive with the layering.p  pstrongOption 3  optional constructor parametersstrongp  pI could just make the constructor parameter to my service class optional, and then extend it into a componentp  precodeclass AccountService implements IAccountService    public userRepository    public function constructIUserRepository userRepository  null      thisgtuserRepository  userRepository       public function getUserByIdid      return thisgtuserRepositorygtgetByIdid      class AccountServiceComponent extends AccountService implements IApplicationComponent   codepre  pstrongConsstrong The optional constructor parameter means this class coudld now be instantiated without supplying it with everything it needs.  p  p...so, any other options Im missing  Or am I just going to have to choose the one that disturbs me the leastp
Negative 7407 pI am trying to have two different stylesheets on my wordpress blog, so that one stylesheet is used when the page is accessed via the web, and the other stylesheet is used when the blog content is accessed via our iOS app.  Right now we are appending apptrue to URL requests from our iOS app in hopes that in our blog we could search for this string and load a different stylesheet.

Negative 7407 pIs there any way to search for methods  types by just some keywordsp  pFor example, imagine the method codeGetLocalPathForOriginalFilecode.  Say, doing a search for codeget local originalcode would return that method or a list of methods by relevance.p  pVisual Studio 2012 does this from the Search Solution Explorer, but only up to classes.  It does not search method names.p  pI am also using Resharper v7 and Visual Studio 2012, so if that does it it would be good as well. p

Negative 7407 pI have a simple MySQL stored procedure that takes two parameters and inserts a row into a table. I can execute it just fine from Zend Framework 2 like thisp  precoderesult  thisgtdbAdaptergtqueryCALL spregisteruser, , arrayusername, password codepre  pI can also access any result sets returned from my stored procedure.p  pWhat I want now is to have an output value from my stored procedure as a third parameter, so something like thisp  precodeDELIMITER  CREATE PROCEDURE spregisteruserIN username VARCHAR50, IN password VARCHAR128, OUT code INTEGER NOT DETERMINISTIC COMMENT Registers a user   BEGIN     INSERT INTO user VALUES username, password     SET code  123   END  codepre  pThe question is how I can access this output variable from PHP ZF2. I have only been able to find examples of how to do it directly through PDO, which I am using. a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenpdo.preparedstatements.php relnofollowExample 4 on this pagea shows how to do it through PDO directly. My concern is that if I use the PDO object directly, I am losing some abstractions and I am thereby assuming that I will always be using PDO.p  pStill, I tried to make it work with PDO directly, like thisp  precodeusername  myusername password  mypassword code  0  stmt  thisgtdbAdaptergtcreateStatement stmtgtprepareCALL spregisteruser, ,  stmtgtgetResourcegtbindParam1, username stmtgtgetResourcegtbindParam2, password stmtgtgetResourcegtbindParam3, code, PDOPARAMINT, 3 stmtgtexecute codepre  pHowever, I get an error saying that the statement could not be executed.p  pThe ideal solution would be one where I could make use of ZF2s abstraction layer, but any ideas on how to access the output parameter are welcome and appreciated.p

Negative 7407 pWhat is the cost associated with calling codenotifycode on an Object on which no other Objects have called codewaitcode in Javap  pThe reason I am interested in this is because I have a worker thread that has a queue of Objects. p  pThe thread loops continuously checking if it has any Objects in the queue that it needs to work with. If it loops and there is nothing in said queue the thread calls wait on on a separate Object. p  pWhen another thread adds an Object to the queue it calls notify on the Object that the worker thread would be waiting on regardless if the working thread is actually waiting. p  pBefore anyone says anything, it is all synchronized correctly and wont throw any exceptionserrors. p  pMy question is is this setup slower then just having the worker thread just continue checking and never call codewaitcode and what is the cost of calling codenotifycode without any threads waiting on the Object p  pThanks for the help in advance p

Given the driver comment, I thought that may be relevant.  I tried updating the northbridge drivers, though they were up to date.  Ill look to see if there are other drivers that need attention.p  pUpdatep  pIve watched memory, nonpaged pool, cpu, handles, ports and none of them are at alarming rates at any time while the system is responsive.  Its possible something spikes at the end, though that is not visible to me.p  pUpdatep  pWhen the system hangs, it stops rendering and does not respond to the keyboard.  The last frame that it rendered stays up though.  The system sounds like it is still running and when the system comes back up there is nothing in the event viewer saying that it crashed.  There are no crash dump files either.  I interpret this as the OS is being blocked out of execution.p

Negative 7407 pI want to create a serialized Python object from outside of Python in this case, from Java in such a way that Python can read it and treat it as if it were an object in Python. Ill start with simpler objects int, float, String, and so on but Id love to know if this can be done with classes as well.p  pFunctionality is first, but being able to do it quickly is a close second. The idea is that I have some data in Java land, but some business logic in Python land. I want to be able to stream data through the python logic as quickly as possible...right now, this data is being serialized as strings and I think this is fairly wasteful.p  pThank you in advancep
Negative 7407 pI want to make a 2x4 array of plots that show distributions changing over time. The default codeggplotcode arrangement with codefacetwrapcode is that the top row has series 1amp2, the second row has series 3amp4, etc. I would like to change this so that the first column has series in order 1234 and then the second column has the next 4 series. This way your eye can compare immediately adjacent distributions in time vertically as I think they should be.p

Negative 7407 pThis is an interview question design a distributed backend for autocomplete.p  pI would answer it as followsp  pAutocomplete is a search in a dictionary by a given suffix. The dictionary should be probably organized as a emtrieem. The dictionary is built from the most frequent queries but its another story.p  pNow I assume the dictionary is not changed frequently e.g. once a day rather than every millisecond. Thus we can just replicate the dictionary across a number of servers that handle autocomplete queries e.g. with a load balancer and roundrobin policy.p  pWe should also think about dictionary but this is also another story.p  pDoes it make sense Am I missing something p

Negative 7407 pIve got a send routine in Delphi 6 that accepts a variablesized block of data a fixedsize header followed by varying amounts of data and the routine eventually calls sendto in Winsock.  Ive coded it two ways, once where the passed block is a var somewhat misleading, but it works and once where a pointer to the block is passed.  A simple version used for benchmarking looks something likep  precodetype    header  record destination, serialnumber integer end   pheader  header  var   smallblock record h header data array[1..5] of integer end   bigblock record h header data array[1..100] of integer end  procedure send1var h header size integer begin h.destination  1  typical header adjustments before sendto h.serialnumber  2 sendtosock, h, size, 0, client, sizeofclient end  procedure send2p pheader size cardinal begin p.destination  1 p.serialnumber  2 sendtosock, p, size, 0, client, sizeofclient end  procedure doit1 begin send1smallblock.h, sizeofsmallblock send1bigblock.h, sizeofbigblock end  procedure doit2 begin send2smallblock, sizeofsmallblock send2bigblock, sizeofbigblock end codepre  pThe send routine will be called often, with many different block sizes, and should be as fast as possible.  After doing a few runs of some simple benchmarks by timing calls with gettickcount, the pointer technique doit2 seems to run about 3 faster on my machine than the var technique doit1, although I dont see any real difference between the two techniques in the object code not that Im an assembler guru.p  pIs the 3 an illusion due to my crude benchmarks, or is the pointer technique really beating the var techniquep

Hope someone can help  this ones been driving me crazy and Ive tried and tried to find an answer but to no avail.p  pBasically, Im updating a friends website with a few stylistic scrolling elements. I chose SuperScrollorama as it looks completely amazing, although Im ready to accept that its complete overkill for what Im trying to achieve. Im really interested in SuperScrollorama anyway, so I suppose I partly chose it just so I could try to use itp  pAnyway, the idea Im trying to implement involvesp  pSingle page website, where section one is simply a centred, large 650px width image and a navigation menu codeltulgtcode centred and fixed to the top of the page containing 6 codeltligtcode elements.p  pOn scrolling down, I want the image to shrink to 250px width, and I want to make a space of 250px between the third and fourth codeltligtcode for the shrunken image to scroll into and then remain for the duration of the scroll. Im trying to create the space by adding a marginright to the third codeltligtcode. I appreciate this may give me undesirable sideeffects, one being that it wont be completely centred. Suggestions welcome here too The problem that Im about to describe, however, I also experienced when trying other methods based around floating and using two separate divs so the marginright itself doesnt seem to be the root causep  pNow, Ive managed to get the image to shrink and attach itself to the top of the page without too much trouble.p  pThe problem that Im having is with the marginright. On page load, the codeltulgtcode appears centred and uniformly spread, as I want it to. The marginright value on the third codeltligtcode is 0. However, the value jumps from 0 to 89px following the tiniest of scroll events. Continuing the scroll works as desired, but on scrolling back up, the margin returns to 89px and then stops.p  pHeres the code that Ive gotp  pHTMLp  precodeltbodygt ltnavgt         ltulgt             ltligtlta hrefhomegtHOMEltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefprogrammegtPROGRAMMEltagtltligt             ltli idgrowmargingtlta hrefticketsgtTICKETSltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefmenugtMENUltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefvenuegtVENUEltagtltligt             ltligtlta hreffaqgtFAQltagtltligt         ltulgt     ltnavgt  ltheader idfixitgt      lth1gtltimg idscaleit srcimageslogo.png gtTITLElth1gt  ltheadergt codepre  pCSSp  precodehtml  height 100 width 100   body      height 100     width 100   nav  position fixed top 0 width 100 height 5 textalign center     nav ul  liststyle none height 100   nav ul li  display inlineblock height 100   nav ul li a  colorbbbbbb textdecoration none margin 8px   header  width 100 position fixed   header h1  width 100 textalign center margin 0 padding 0  codepre  pAnd the JSp  precodeltscriptgt     document.readyfunction          var controller  .superscrollorama         reverse true              var windowHeightwindow.innerHeight         var scrollDuration  windowHeight           controller.addTweengrowmargin,              TweenMax.to growmargin, .25, cssmarginright250px, immediateRendertrue, scrollDuration         controller.addTweenscaleit,              TweenMax.fromTo scaleit, .25, csswidth650px, immediateRendertrue, easeQuad.easeInOut, csswidth250px, easeQuad.easeInOut,              scrollDuration         controller.addTweenfixit,              TweenMax.fromTo fixit, .25, csstop40, immediateRendertrue, easeQuad.easeInOut, csstop4, easeQuad.easeInOut,              scrollDuration           ltscriptgt codepre  pAny help would be so much appreciated Its driving me absolutely crazyp  pThank youp  pRobp

Negative 7407 pI have an installer from a third party.  Through trial and error I discovered it was an innosetup installer.  When I call it with the silent flag it installs just fine, until it executes installers for 3 dependencies direct X is one, for example which then require user input to cancel.  I want to be able to run the installer and have it either install the dependencies silently or not at all.  When going through the installer GUI normally it does give me 3 checkboxes at the end on the last page of the wizard before I would hit the Finish button that allows me to choose whether or not to install the dependencies. Is there a way of doing this that I dont know about  From my research it seems impossible without knowing the types and components available and executing the installer with the help or  options had no effect and I will probably need to get a new installer from the third party.  The only other option I can think of would be to have some sort of timeout that after a certain period of time of inactivity from the installer I kill the install process since the files I was interested in had already been installed at that point I think.p
Negative 7407 pWhat are the advantages to using a private NuGet server as opposed to having shared library projects which are then included in every solutionp  pWe have several libraries which are shared across our codebase which currently Ive included using a relative path to the project within each solution.p  pThe current problem I can see with a shared project, is that TFS uses folders for its branching strategy and that breaks the projects relative path links in each solution.  So a NuGet server would get round this issue.p

Negative 7407 pIm new to the world of threading, but a few aspects of an app Im working on require me to use a BackgroundWorker control to prevent the UI freezing up while its doing some file operations.p  pWhat Im trying to do is update a couple of form labels from within the BackgroundWorker.

Ive done some further reading, and Im wondering if Im going about this the right way.  The reason Im using a BackgroundWorker is to ensure that the UI remains responsive while Im performing file operations.  The issue is, I still need to wait until the BackgroundWorker has done its job so I can return a boolean indicating the success of the operation.  Theres ways to work around this, but from my reading, having to wait for a BackgroundWorker to complete its work is defeating the purpose of using it in the first place.  So, whats the best way to go about preventing the UI from locking upp

Negative 7407 pSo this is a weird one.p  pIm working on a Wordpress theme, and the theme is supposed to be fully responsive. I created a gallery of sorts that consists of multiple rows of 3 thumbnails that when clicked open in a lightbox.  I found a snippet of code online for creating responsive square elements elements whose height adjusts to match their responsive width using only CSS.  This involves setting a width in percentage say 50, and then setting codeheight0pxcode and codepaddingbottom50code.  I went ahead and placed every image in a responsive container that resize like this, and then I set the images max width and max height so they wouldnt overflow their responsive square container.p  pThis displays as expected in all browsers save for ie7.  In ie7, the image seems to disappear.

The map is being called somehow in the javascript, but I dont know where, and Im a little confused how you know youre using the new version of google maps.p  pPlease helpp  precodefunction   function Mapaddress, desc, title, markerico, spanId      var me  this  this.spanId  spanId  var latlng  new google.maps.LatLng0, 0  var blue           stylers [          saturation 60 ,          lightness 20 ,          hue 0000BB     ]      var myOptions       styles blue,     zoom 15,     mapTypeId google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP,     center latlng       this.map  new google.maps.Mapdocument.getElementByIdmap  this.spanId, myOptions this.contentString  desc this.directionsDisplay  new google.maps.DirectionsRenderer this.directionsDisplay.setMapthis.map  this.directionsDisplay.setPaneldocument.getElementByIdroute  this.spanId this.marker  new google.maps.Marker     position city,     map this.map,     title title,     icon markerico,     animation google.maps.Animation.DROP     var infowindow  new google.maps.InfoWindow     content this.contentString   google.maps.event.addListenerthis.marker, click, function       infowindow.openme.map, me.marker   this.directionsService  new google.maps.DirectionsService  this.geocoder  new google.maps.Geocoder  var city  address  this.geocoder.geocode address city , function results, status      if status  google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK          address  results[0].formattedaddress          me.map.setCenterresults[0].geometry.location         me.marker.setOptions         position results[0].geometry.location               else          alertGeocode was not successful for the following reason   status        if document.getElementByIdstart  this.spanId      var input  document.getElementByIdstart  this.spanId      var autocomplete  new google.maps.places.Autocompleteinput      google.maps.event.addListenerautocomplete, placechanged, function           input.className           var place  autocomplete.getPlace         if place.geometry              input.className  notfound             return                                Map.prototype.route  function      var me  this     var radioButtons  document.getElementsByNametravel  this.spanId     for var i  0 i lt radioButtons.length i          if radioButtons[i].checked          var selectedMode  radioButtons[i].value                   var request           origin document.getElementByIdstart  this.spanId.value,         destination document.getElementByIdend  this.spanId.value,         travelMode google.maps.TravelMode[selectedMode]           me.directionsService.routerequest, function result, status          if status  google.maps.DirectionsStatus.OK          me.directionsDisplay.setDirectionsresult          else if status  google.maps.DirectionsStatus.NOTFOUND          alertNo corresponding geographic location could be found for the specified address.

Negative 7407 pIm trying to get my screen shot image to be displayed in a picture box held on my Control panel form.

I suspect you need to pass screenCap to the   constructor of Form1 which would need to store it in a field so that   you could use the same instance when you call CaptureImage within   Form1p blockquote  pI have no idea how to implement the advice that was given to me. In my first two lines of code I simply tried to take away the creation of a new instance of my ScreenCapture class and write p  precode  ScreenCapture.CaptureImageshowCursor, curSize, curPosition, startPoint, Point.Empty, bounds, screenPath, fi codepre  pBut this generates the following errorp  blockquote   pError 1   An object reference is required for the nonstatic field, method, or property DotFlickScreenCapture.ScreenCapture.CaptureImagebool, System.Drawing.Size, System.Drawing.Point, System.Drawing.Point, System.Drawing.Point, System.Drawing.Rectangle, string, stringp blockquote  pSo to get rid of this error I turned the Method being called to a static class but this generated a whole host of different errors with my code trying to store the image takenp  precode     Image img  Imagebitmap      if OnUpdateStatus  null return       ProgressEventArgs args  new ProgressEventArgsimg      OnUpdateStatusthis, args codepre  pIt claims that my OnUpdateStatus require an object reference and that using the THIS keyword where I have is not valid in a static field or environment. p  pIs anyone able to help with getting my image to be displayed in an image box p
Negative 7407 pI have migrated all my personal, pet projects to Dropbox, and this includes source code.p  pI enjoy using Python because I can switch to Windows or Linux machines, and I just to execute scripts and they work right away, no matter which OS or which specific machine I am using.p  pHowever, I would like to improve my workflow regarding REUSE of python functionality, which is overwhelmingly duplicated. Due to ineptlazy handling of imports, and the tendency to copypaste my own module files to the same folder of every new script, not to say reimplementing the same microfunctionality over and over, I am seriously motivated to stop this workflow and adhere to strong reuse by using bettercrafted, DRYed modules, and structured importing, ending up with higherlevel, lean, problemspecific scripts.p  pIts important context that Ive been bitten by the way .Net works in VisualStudio, you just go on codeusingcode namespaces right away well, sort of, provided the right references have been added, we know.p  pI have read quite a lot about .pth files, stronginitstrong.py files, appending to codesys.pathcode, but that has been quite confusing to me.p  pMy goals would bep  ul liHave a folder inside Dropbox or GDrive, or whatever, with two subfolders codeScriptscode and codeModulescodeli licodeScriptscode folder would contain only independent, singlefile scripts, possibly inside subfolders in arbitrary levels of nesting, but they should not reference one another in any way, just reference the systeminstalled Python modules AND the modules packaged in codeScriptscode folderli licodeModulescode folder should contain some hierarchical structure of folders and namespaces, with higherlevel modules importingreusing lowerlevel modules, and any of these modules using systeminstalled Python modules.li ul  pAn additional desireable feature would be the ability to move some script elsewhere in the computer copy it to desktop folder, for exemple and with minimal or no modification it would still run, by still referencing modules inside codeDropboxthatMagicFolderModulescode.p  pA typical workflow that would reflect my needsp  ol liI create a script in one machine, and make it run properlyli liThen I go to another machine also with Dropbox, install some lacking python modules say, Numpy, or PIL, and then run the script I created in the other machineli liI update the script, adding some imports to more alreadyexisting modules from codeModulescode folder, and make it run properly. Ideally, the scripts would contain minimal if any boilerplate codeli liI come back to the previous machine, wait for Dropbox to sync, and run the updated script right awayli ol  pI dont have a firm idea on how to achieve this, and my few previously mentioned tries with codeinitcode files and .pth files instead of simplify ended up making everything more complicated. But I still think this is something so natural, so obvious, that probably I am just missing something that is widely known by the initiated.p  pAny help is welcome, thanks for readingp  pEDIT an interesting, more detailed question on an almost identical problem with no accepted answer is thisp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq15026634401828Local collection of Python packages best way to import themap

Negative 7407 pIm using the common RelayCommand class. Far up the visual tree, I have a number of my commands tied to UserControl.InputBindings with some common letter shortcuts. I also have a TextBox. However, when my TextBox has focus and I press any of the keys that are bound to commands, the command executes and the character never shows in the TextBox. I had thought that the focused element would have the first chance to use the key and mark it as handled.

Negative 7407 pIm currently building a tool which pulls data from Bloomberg prior to making different computations and running data. The tool works great except when one of the tickers or other inputs is invalid in which case it throws an infinite loop. This occurs bc Bloomberg data requires an x second delay to be programmed in to make sure that cells load which i have and works great, however if the ticker or other input is invalid itself... the cell the timer is checking for validity will always return and error and the check subs will get caught within themselves.p  pWhat I want to do is set a global variable time.p  pSet the timer to 0 sec in the beginning of the sub..p  pIf the timer reaches 40 sec lets say... break the sub and increment the loop.p  pMy code is too difficult to understand to post here... but I was wondering if anyone could provide some light exactly on the conditions above. Im not sure how to initialize and set variables equal to time and how to use the time to break subs. A generic example would be extremely helpful.p

Negative 7407 pWell, in the proccess of converting an image from TIFF to PNG format, I really want the final image to be the smallest possible so I am setting the bit depth to 1 blackampwhite, I am working with images of signatures.

Negative 7407 pIn a book I am reading Querying SQL Server 2012 the author talks about theory of how databases work. He mentions relations, attributes and tuples etc.p  pHe frequently stresses the fact that some aspect of TSQL is not relational. Like in the following excerptp  blockquote   pUnlike in previous phases where the result was relational, the output   of this phase isnt relational because it has a guaranteed order. The   result of this phase is what standard SQL calls a cursor. Note that   the use of the term cursor here is conceptual. TSQL also supports an   object called a cursor that is defined based on a result of a query,   and that allows fetching rows one at a time in a specified order. You   might care about returning the result of a query in a specific order   for presentation purposes or if the caller needs to consume the result   in that manner through some cursor mechanism that fetches the rows one   at a time. strongBut remember that such processing isnt relationalstrong. If you   need to process the query result in a relational mannerfor example,   define a table expression like a view based on the query details   later in Chapter 4the result will need to be relational. Also,   sorting data can add cost to the query processing. If you dont care   about the order in which the result rows are returned, you can avoid   this unnecessary cost by not adding an ORDER BY clause.p blockquote  pI would like to know, since every implementation of codeSQLcode pretty much has an codeORDER BYcode clause which makes it nonrelational, strongwhy does it even matterstrong that the set after codeORDER BYcode is used its not relational anymore since its like that every wherep  pI can understand if he said it was non standard, for example using codecode instead of codeltgtcode for inequality because that affects portability etc. but I do not understand why something is better being relational.p  pPlease enlighten.p

In the second case, I get an error message about fpermissive or something like that. I just want to confirm that the index goes out of scope whenever the loop ends, because that seems to be what is happening. I was trying to use the index for something later on, I guess I just have to put a second index in the loop to increment as i or j do, and then I can use this value later. i.e.p  precode int index  0  forint j  0 jltn j  . . .  index    cout ltlt index ltltendl codepre  pWould someone confirm this for mep

Negative 7407 pSo, Im not sure how to properly explain this one, so if something is unclear ask in the comments, Ill try to use the exam question layout so you can easily spot restrictions.p  pProblemp  pYoure given an input of codePanelcode with fixed size, an array of codePointF[]code of fixed size codencode, and the distance data that contains distances between each pair of points in indexed arrays of size codencode which are accessed via codeDistanceDatacode field in the following wayp  pcodeDistanceData[i].getDistanceskcode returns codeintcode which represents the distance between ith and kth point. As a corollary, the codeDistanceData[k].getDistancesicode returns the same value. If codeikcode, it returns code0code.p  pYour task is to update the codePanelcode so that it honestly represents the codeDistanceDatacode i.e. if codeDistanceData[1].getDistances3 lt DistanceData[1].getDistances4code then the panel should display 1st and 3rd point closer than the 1st and 4th point etc.p  pNote The distance data is inputted independently of the Points previously drawn on the Panel. Or rather, the Panel only contains the number of Points and you need to distribute them according to the values found in codeDistanceDatacode.p  pNote2 The tag travellingsalesman is there to remind you that all the points are dependent on each other i.e. all pairs have unique distance.p  pMy take The problem Im facing is if I iteratively solve this  point by point, I find that I break the solution I did in the previous steps. To illustrate this If I run a loop for 4 points and in the first iteration I draw the points based on the distances from the first point, the next step will almost certainly scrap that solution if it looks at the distances from the second point and so on...p
Negative 7407 pOk, so Im new to IndexedDB and not particularly experienced with Javascript. Right now, Ive got code working such that the user can browse to a file on their file system, and, when selected, the file is broken up into chunks by using slice, those chunks are converted to Hex strings, and the strings along with a key are stored in IndexedDB.p  pThe nice thing about this modality is that a user could select a very large file, and, since Im using the right constructs, the whole file doesnt have to be loaded in memory all at once.p  pNow Im attempting to read those Hex strings back out and have the browser pop a Save as dialog when the user clicks a button. The issue is that I havent managed to find a way to stream the data out of IndexedDB into a Save As input. Are any of you aware of a way to do this Im coming up pretty short on my end.p  pThanksp

Negative 7407 pIm writing some code that has to transform a number of vertex coordinates to clipprojection space on the CPU to integrate with an existing application shaders are not an option here as the application provides its own shaders at a later point, for which I have a test case which intends to have the result be a basic camerastyle transformation  projection looking down a camera rotated around the X axis.p  pThe test case is as followsp  precodeinclude ltwindows.hgt include ltxnamath.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  int main      XMVECTOR atPos  XMVectorSet925.0f, 511.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f     XMVECTOR eyePos  XMVectorSet925.0f, 311.0f, 200.0f, 0.0f     XMVECTOR upDir  XMVectorSet0.f, 0.f, 1.f, 0.0f      XMMATRIX viewMatrix  XMMatrixLookAtLHeyePos, atPos, upDir     XMMATRIX projectionMatrix  XMMatrixPerspectiveFovLHXMConvertToRadians55.f, 1.0f, 0.1f, 5000.0f      XMMATRIX viewProjMatrix  viewMatrix  projectionMatrix      XMVECTOR coord1  XMVectorSet925.0f, 500.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f     XMVECTOR coord2  XMVectorSet925.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f     XMVECTOR coord3  XMVectorSet925.0f, 1000.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f      coord1  XMVector3TransformCoordcoord1, viewProjMatrix     coord2  XMVector3TransformCoordcoord2, viewProjMatrix     coord3  XMVector3TransformCoordcoord3, viewProjMatrix      printf    0 g g gn, XMVectorGetXcoord2, XMVectorGetYcoord2, XMVectorGetZcoord2     printf 500 g g gn, XMVectorGetXcoord1, XMVectorGetYcoord1, XMVectorGetZcoord1     printf1000 g g gn, XMVectorGetXcoord3, XMVectorGetYcoord3, XMVectorGetZcoord3      getcstdin  codepre  pIf I just transform by the view matrix, Im noticing the Y value correctly moving correlated with the input Y value of the coordinates but adding the projection matrix the Y value seems to wrap around making both the coordinate that are to the north of the view and the coordinate to the south of the view extend in the same direction in projection space, which results in the eventual faces transformed using similar code in the target application overlapping each other instead of drawing in the correct order.p  pWhat am I doing wrong in this regard, and how can I get a valid result for at least this input i.e. extending in the same manner as the input Y is advancing, even though these vertices are out of the given projection range, which I doubt should be a problemp

To be more precise when the client does not reply with an ACK, thus leaving the server hanging with memory that is reserved for them.p  pI had a look through the available software out there, but I didnt manage to find anything that would allow me to simulate the TCP Three Way Handshake.p  pThen I found strongJava Socketsstrong. I had a look through a number of tutorials, but I find them very unclear. Also, they seem to have a highlevel view, which would not allow me to manipulate the SYN, SYNACK, ACK sequence.p  pTherefore, I stepped down into the actual strongjava.netstrong with a decompiler tool. I had a look at various classes, but I cant find any references to the actual SYN messages being sent. Some methods sound like they do the thing, but I can find only method calls and their interface definitions.

Negative 7407 pI have a class that extends from ImageView well actually are three classes that extends one from the other, but thats not relevant to perform some custom drawing around the drawable drawn by the ImageView. Now, my code is fine or at least I think is fine, after having profiled it it takes just a bunch of ms to run but when setting the image image loaded as a Bitmap everything hangs for about 500 ms, not a lot but enough to be noticeable. p  pSadly this class has to be used inside a GridView or ListView and everything is fine until, after the images have been load through a hrefhttpsquare.github.iopicasso relnofollowPicassoa, so obviously my problem is not the loading of the image on the main thread, the images are set in the imageviews. Now, since each ImageView takes some hundreds ms to display the image it makes the GridView lag while scrolling if images are being set. p  pNow as you can see from the image below results of method profiling provided by DDMS what takes so much time is the method codeGLES20Canvas.nDrawDisplayListcodep  pNote The images are down scaled to a size a little lower respect the ImageView, so this solution has already been tried.p  pNow to the question How can I display in an efficient and fast manner this Bitmapp  pThank you all in advancep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comhECgS.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhECgS.png altdrawing profileap  pstrongEDITstrong Time for some code, as asked by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers132047jakewhartonJakeWhartonap  precodeOverride public boolean onPreDraw      if mNeedRedraw         updateAttrs     return true   Override protected void onDrawCanvas canvas      canvas.save     if mClippingPath  null          canvas.clipPathmClippingPath          super.onDrawcanvas     canvas.restore     if mBorderPath  null ampamp mBorderPaint  null          canvas.drawPathmBorderPath, mBorderPaint       codepre  pNow the other three subclass have a really similar code, obviously the codemNeedRedrawcode flag is set only when really needed since it recalculate all the things needed for a correct drawing but always reusing objects, no object allocation is done in the codeupdateAttrscode method.p  pJust for completeness sakep  pThe draw of the first subclassp  precodeOverride protected void onDrawCanvas canvas      super.onDrawcanvas     if mBackgroundPaint  null ampamp mBackgroundPath  null          canvas.drawPathmBackgroundPath, mBackgroundPaint         canvas.drawTextOnPathmText, mBackgroundPath, mHorizontalOffset, mMidTextHeight, mTextPaint         if mIcon  null ampamp mIconTransformationMatrix  null              canvas.drawBitmapmIcon, mIconTransformationMatrix, mTextPaint                 Override public boolean onPreDraw      boolean result  super.onPreDraw     if mFooNeedRedraw         updateAttrs     return result  codepre  pThe draw of the second subclassp  precodeOverride public boolean onPreDraw      boolean result  super.onPreDraw     if mBarNeedRedraw         updateAttrs     return result   Override protected void onDrawCanvas canvas      super.onDrawcanvas     if mArc  null ampamp isInEditMode           canvas.drawPathmArc, mArcPaint       codepre  pAnd finally the code of the last subclassp  precodeOverride public boolean onPreDraw      boolean result  super.onPreDraw     if mBazNeedRedraw  mTrackNeedRedraw         updateAttrs     return result   Override protected void onDrawCanvas canvas      super.onDrawcanvas     ifmTrackVisible         canvas.drawBitmapmThumbTrackIcon, mThumbIconTransformationMatrix, mThumbPaint  codepre  pThis is all.

Negative 7407 pI have a desktop app that clients are using at the moment and each client has access to their own local network database.  My manager has decided that its best to merge these databases and only have one. All clients would then access that one database through a webservice that sits on the cloud. I would like to weight the pros and cons before we go ahead with this decision. The one option we have is to have a ClientID in each of the tables which will result in each table having a composite key .p  pI have heard that another option would be to use schemas .Please advise how the schema way would work and is this the best way in comparison to having a composite key in each table. Thank you.p

Negative 7407 pIm attempting to implement a camera controller for a first person, mouselook based camera for OpenGL. This is a simple problem when the camera is always oriented normally camera up vector  world Y axis. However, Im having real trouble getting everything working properly with a camera that can be used seamlessly for any orientation. The purpose is to allow a player to move around an entire planet. An additional requirement is that the direction remain the same relative to the orientation as the cameras orientation changes. An example would be, if youre walking around a planet, the direction remains the same relative to the ground, so as you go down along the side from a pole, the direction is also automatically rotated.p  pSo far, Ive attempted a number of different things to get this working, but as I see it, there should be two different ways of doing this. The first is to do regular camera rotation based on yaw and pitch angles from the world axes, and then transform the resulting look direction by the camera orientation to obtain the final look direction. The second approach is to rotate the camera with yaw and pitch angles based on calculated up and right vectors. The up vector is easy here its just the orientation. I havent gotten any right vector Ive found to work correctly though.p  pOK, heres the code for these two approaches.p  pstrongCommon codestrongp  precode morientation calculated from planet center to current position mhorizontal  horizontal mvertical  vertical  while mhorizontal gt TWOPI      mhorizontal  TWOPI   while mhorizontal lt TWOPI      mhorizontal  TWOPI   if mvertical gt MAXVERTICAL      mvertical  MAXVERTICAL  else if mvertical lt MAXVERTICAL      mvertical  MAXVERTICAL    code from either implementation  mview  glmlookAtmposition, mposition  mdirection, morientation codepre  pstrongFirst approachstrong with yaw, pitch about world axes and then transformp  precode check for morientation  WORLDUP... glmvec3 axis  glmnormalizeglmcrossWORLDUP, morientation float angledegrees  acosfmorientation.y  RADSTODEGREES glmmat4 trans  glmrotateglmmat4, angledegrees, axis   can also be determined with two rotation matrices about world axes, end result is identical mdirection  glmvec3cosfmvertical  sinfmhorizontal,                         sinfmvertical,                         cosfmvertical  cosfmhorizontal mdirection  glmvec3trans  glmvec4mdirection codepre  pstrongSecond approachstrong with yaw and pitch about appropriate up and right vectorsp  precodemright    tried literally everything glmmat4 yaw  glmrotateglmmat4, mhorizontal, morientation glmmat4 pitch  glmrotateglmmat4, mvertical, mright glmmat4 trans  yaw  pitch mdirection  glmvec3trans[2]  z axis codepre  pOK, so heres the problem. The first approach works almost perfectly, but near the south pole of a planet within 15 degrees of orientation0,1,0, effect gets stronger closer you are, the camera is automatically rotated toward the south pole as the orientation changes. So if the camera orientation does not change, near the south pole, the camera works perfectly. Any change in orientation results in the camera rotating toward the south pole. The more orientation change, the more the camera rotates. Now I have tried removing either the pitch or yaw from the world axis camera rotation, and this effect appears only with the pitch calculation included. With only yaw, then the camera behaves perfectly lacking any pitch control ofc. As far as I can tell, emmy transformation to go from regular up0,1,0 to the current orientation is incorrectem. Any help on thatp  pNow the other way to do things appears to work somewhat correctly, but I simply have not found a good right vector. Everything Ive tried results in strange behavior of both horizontal and vertical movements. The most obvious solution, cross product of previous frames direction and current orientation to produce the right vector doesnt work. Any suggestions for a good right vectorp  pIm also happy to see completely different solutions to this problem. I know its possible, but no amount of searching has given me a good solution. Thanks very much in advance.p  pEdit 1 Tried a few more things in response to Pawe Stawarzp  pResults in incorrect orientation of camera and weird mouse movement. I made sure my matrix multiplication was in the correct order. I also tried the transpose.p  precodemview  glmlookAtglmvec30.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, mdirection, mup mview  trans  mview trans is rotation from orientation0,1,0 to orientationmorientation codepre  pResults in the same problem as previously, with the camera rotating toward the south pole by itself. Also the vertical mouse rotation is not correct, causes camera to go in circles.p  precodemview  glmlookAtglmvec30.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, mdirection, mup mview  trans  mview mdirection  glmvec3mview[2]  mview  glmlookAtmposition, mdirection  mposition, morientation codepre  pEdit 2 Using the RIGHT vector method, with no transformation between orientations is working a little better. However, it causes the camera yaw to oscillate wildly with pitch near to vertical at least 5 degrees away from vertical. In addition, the range of motion for pitch is not adjusted by the orientation, so for example on the side of the planet, vertical motion is restricted to directly in front of you to behind you 0,1,0 to 0,1,0.p  precodeglmmat4 yaw  glmrotateglmmat4, mhorizontal  ONEEIGHTYPI, morientation glmmat4 pitch  glmrotateglmmat4, mvertical  ONEEIGHTYPI, mright  glmmat4 cam  pitch  yaw  mright  glmvec3cam[0] mup  glmvec3cam[1] mdirection  glmvec3cam[2]  mview  glmlookAtmposition, mdirection  mposition, mup mvp  mperspective  mview codepre

How can I exclude the child pages and prevent them from displaying in the first part of the loopp  pMany thanks.    p  precodeltphp  echo ltulgt if  haveposts   while  haveposts       thepost     echo ltligtlth1gt.getthetitle.lth1gt      argsarray             orderby gt menuorder,             order gt ASC,              postparent gt postgtID,                  posttype gt getposttype postgtID ,             postsperpage gt 10           childpages  new WPQueryargs      ifchildpagesgtpostcount gt 0   display the children content           echo ltulgt         while childpagesgthaveposts               childpagesgtthepost              echo ltligtlth2gt.getthetitle.lth2gtltligt              echo ltligtlth2gt.thecontent.lth2gtltligt                  echo ltulgt          wpresetquery      echo ltligt               echo ltulgt  gt codepre  pstrongUpdatestrong Managed to get a little bit further, almost there I think.

Negative 7407 pI wanted to make an audiorecording app. I added the WasappAudioComp API VC project  to my existing project but it does not show its existence. I build it and rebuilt it many times but the error persisted. I cant attach the screen shot where the C project has been loaded but it does not show in the class.p  pPlease do help.p
Negative 7407 pI started having this weird problem recently. My application uses both C and C, and Ive been able to debug and step through the code in either my C Dlls or my C assemblies.p  pFor some reason, I cant put braeakpoints in my C code anymore, because Im unable to use the mouse once the breakpoint is reached.  Clicking anywhere in windows 7 seems to hang the entire O.S. for a few seconds, with a smallgreenprogressbar filling up slowly where the mouse is located. When I get control of the mouse again, its as though I did emnotem click anywhere.  I cant click stop debug, I cant click applications in the Windows Taskbar, I cant do anything with the mouse except hang the system for a few seconds.p  pOnly when I hit F5 continue the execution of the code and the application runs again, then I can use the mouse.p  pNote 1 this problem also happens if I attach to process Note 2 this doesnt happen when I debug in C.p  pAny ideas  I realize this is a vague question about a vague problem... but any help would be appreciated at this point.p  pThank you.  p

Negative 7407 pSo I have a bunch of methods, all of which take in various parameters of different data types, what im trying to achieve is a way to call into another method, passing in all the parameters that the current method takes in as well as its values, and in that method i will eventually be doing different types of validation based on the data type of the parameter. The idea being that I will have one validation method that I will be able to call at the beginning of each method, rather than going through each method and validating the parameters one at a time within each method. Below is a rough outline of what im trying to achieve, ive looked around and seem to found some uses with Reflection, but it seems passing the parameter types as well as their values is a bit trickier and was wondering if anyone else had come into a similar form of problem.p  precodepublic void doStuffAint a, string b, string c, bool d      var params       if validateInputparams               do stuff        public void doStuffBstring x, string y, int z      var params       if validateInputparams               do stuff        public bool validateInput params       do validation  codepre

Negative 7407 pPlease consider the following codep  precodeBase b if something     b  DerivedA else     b  DerivedB codepre  pIts well known that in such a case, slicing occurs In C we cant assign a variable of a base type an object of the derived type the object would be sliced off anything that isnt defined in the base type. If we want to do such a thing, we have to use pointers or references.p  pI want to understand the actual reason for this. I.e., the reason why a codeBasecode variable cant hold a codeDerivedcode object without slicing it.p  pMy assumption is that the reason for this is that a codeBasecode object and a codeDerivedcode object might not be of the same size, thus we cant make guarantees on being able to store an entire codeDerivedcode object in a codeBasecode variable. A codeBasecode might take up 4 bytes, while a codeDerivedcode is 7 bytes. So we settle to always slicing the derived object to fit the size of the base type.p  pWe emareem able to do this with pointers, because they all occupy the same amount of memory.p  pIs this assumption correct If not, what is the actual reason for slicingp

How can I abstract this behavior so the next time I want an AnimalQueue or a CustomerQueue I can just create one in my applicationp  pI know I can make a generator which will create the model code with names and methods like Job hardcoded in, then call p  precoderails g MyCoolQueue Job codepre  pbut this seems quite complicated. There are routes and names and views and strong parameters methods to be set up. Is there another way Can use inheritance or interfaces to make this work Something likep  precodeclass QueueItem lt ActiveRecordBase end  class JobQueueItem lt QueueItem     belongsto Job end  class QueueItemsController lt ApplicationController      all my queue controls, reference the foreign key and associated model in a generic way... end  class JobQueueItemsController lt QueueItemsController      suddenly I have the controls to queue jobs end   And also some views that generically reference the necessary fields and models in a QueueItem  Suddenly I have views for JobQueueItems codepre  pHow does one go about making an abstract data type, tool, or other abstract relationship that is easily inserted in to a rails app One could imagine any number of scenarios where behavior and relationships can be abstracted and only need the names of models and fields to be filled in. Im sure experienced rails developers dont recode everything from scratch every time or just copy and paste. As I said before, I am new to ruby and rails, so I would like to learn the standard RoR way to do something like this. Is code generation the only wayp  pThanksp

Negative 7407 pI have a MultiDataTrigger where if a property in my view model is true AND the IsMouseOver on the TabItem is true, then the Border should appear red with 2.5 thickness.p  pI couldnt get both the property and IsMouseOver to work, so I tried just my property. That worked correctly, but still had the expected issue where it would be red with 2.5 thickness, up until I hovered over the tab. So I then tried taking out my view model property and just had the IsMouseOver check as a condition. This doesnt work.

Negative 7407 pIve got a coffeescript based project that does not use CommonJS style for its modules. I am trying to get coverage reports for my unit tests using a hrefhttpsgithub.combenbriacoffeecoverage relnofollowcoffeecoveragea, but am having absolutely no luck.p  pIn this app, each module is exposed on codewindowcode, scoped to our namespace such as codewindow.NA.MyModulecode. Since the modules are not CommonJSified, we cant coderequirecode them in our test files, so I followed a hrefhttpsgithub.combenbriacoffeecoveragestaticcompilation relnofollowthe coffeecoverage static compilation stepsa. My testing environment uses codejsdomcode to create a headless browser and load a single concatenated file that contains all the instrumented JS. After days of struggling with things I believe that I have a setup that emshouldem  but refuses to  work. My setup is using codegulpcode, spawning tasks with codegulpshellcode for codecoffeeCoveragecode and codemochacode, using the codehtmlcovcode reporter.p  pAs I said, my tests are running fine they pass or fail as one would expect, and a coverage report is generated at the specified path. My problem is that the coverage report is always empty, claiming that no code was run whatsoever and showing a 0 for every single line...p  pHere are the details of my setup and my build processp  pCoffeeScript files are organized in many subdirectories under codesrccodep  pcodegulpcode task runs codecoffeeCoveragecode as a shell task on the entire directory, exporting instrumented files to codetmpcode with this command...p  precodecoverageCmd  [   coffeeCoverage   path relative   i .jstestinit.js   .pathtocoffeescript   .pathtoinstrumentedfiles ].join   gulp.task coffeecoverage, shell.taskcoverageCmd codepre  p... which generates a copy of the directory structure found in codesrccode at codetmpcode  with all coffeescript files replaced by instrumented js files  and an codeinit.jscode file that looks like it shouldp  pAnother codegulpcode task concatenates all the instrumented files into one large file so it can easily be loaded into a codejsdomcode browser context for testingp  precodetask buildtest, [coffeecoverage], gt   gulp.src pathtoinstrumentedfiles     .pipe concat testapp.js     .pipe dest pathtotestdir codepre  pAnother codegulpcode task runs codemochacode as a shell command with the following options note that Im requiring the codeinit.jscode file that codecoffeeCoveragecode generatedp  precodemochaCmd  [   mocha   compilers coffeecoffeescriptregister   reporter htmlcov   bail   require jstestinit.js   jstestspecinit.coffee   jstestunit.coffee   gt coffeecoveragecoverage.html ].join   task testswithcoverage, [buildtest], shell.taskmochaCmd codepre  pMocha runs my codespecinitcode file first, which creates a codejsdomcode instance that loads the concatenated, instrumented js file in the codeltheadgtcode of the DOM inside a codebeforecode callp  precodebefore next gt   config      html ltbodygtltbodygt     scripts [pathtoconcatenatedinstrumentedjsfile]     features       FetchExternalResources [script]       ProcessExternalResources [script]     done error, window gt       if error then console.log error.stack  error       root.NA  window.NA       next   jsdom.env config codepre  pAll tests run properly, using this codejsdomcode instance modules are instantiated and destroyed, events are triggered and heard, and then a coverage report appears in the specified folder that says not a single line was run.p  pIs there something wrong with my setup The best that I can understand it is that the codeinit.jscode that is required by codemochacode is where the report is coming from. My suite ignores the fact that there is instrumented code being run in the tests, but it sees that there are lines that should be running thanks to the init file. I cannot require the entire test file into codemochacode because there are numerous calls to codewindowcode, which does not exist in the context of codemochacode until codejsdomcode is instantiated. What I feel like needs to happen is that I need to tell codemochacode to use the codejscoveragecode variable inside the file loaded by codejsdomcode and emnotem codeinit.jscode.p  pThanks in advance for any help.p

Negative 7407 pI am working on reporting on our Salesforce solution with Tableau, and am loving it so far. I do have a question however which I have not been able to crack.p  pWe utilize contact roles and team members in our opportunities module, both of which reside in separate tables. Each opportunity can have multiple contacts and multiple team members. I have tried the following methods to try and display all of this information in a reportp  ol lipI set up data connections to each table individually to avoid hitting the SF API limit. I had to use the team members table as the primary data source, but was then able to pull in other opportunity information. This worked great, but of course when adding contact roles I got the elusive asterisk indicating the aggregation was finding multiple values for each opportunity in the blended secondary source.pli lipI tried joining one of the tables contact roles or team members to the opportunities table, and then blending it with the other table I needed. I got the same results as in 1.pli ol  pSo my question is if theres a better way to go about this I couldnt join both tables to the opportunities table in the data connection tool as they dont show up for selection in the multiple tables mode. Is there a way to lookup data from another worksheet that could display the items neededp  pI cant really post a sample data file as the data I work with is highly confidential.

I understand futureget will block till the respective thread is completed. The problem I encounter is, however, it never returns. I commented out the single line of Futureget and it proceeded.p  pI looked into the code in cacheloadCache and find it tries to retrieve data from a DB table, like service.getData, underneath it call DAO which in turn use Springs getSqlMapClientTemplate and iBatis SQL.

First my apology that the earlier info is not sufficient for people to pinpoint the issue. p  pThis is a Spring project and the code in the 2nd section is inside a stronginitmethodstrong called eminitem of a bean. The aforementioned DAO is also registered in Spring. So the problem seems to be that the method init is hanging up bcoz of the block f.get and Spring config cant be completed is it kind of circular dependencies I still havent figured out the best approach to it...p  pThanks,p  pJonp

Negative 7407 pThe following is a homework assignment, so I would rather get hints or bits of information that would help me figure this out, and not complete answers.p  blockquote   pConsider S an algorithm solution to a problem that takes as input an array A of size n. After analysis, the following conclusion was obtainedp      ul   lipAlgorithm S executes an Ontime computation for each even number in A.pli   lipAlgorithm S executes an Ologntime computation for each odd number in A.pli   ul      pWhat are the best and worst case time for algorithm Sp blockquote  pFrom this I understand that the time complexity changes in accordance to n being even or odd. In other words, if n is even, S takes On time and when n is odd, S takes Ologn.p  pIs it a simple matter of taking the best case and the worst case of both growthrates, and choosing their boundaries Meaningp  pBest case of On is O1, and worst case is On.p  pBest case of Ologn is Ologn and worst case is Ologn.p  pTherefore the best case for Algorithm S is Ologn and the worst case is Onp  pAm I missing something or am I wrong in assessing the different bestworst case of both cases of bigOhp  hr  pstrong1st attemptstrongp  pOk, so I completely misunderstood the problem. Thanks to candu, I can now better understand what is required of me, and so try to calculate the best and worst case better.p  pIt seems that Algorithm S changes its runtime according to emEACH number in Aem. If the number is even, the runtime is On, and if the number is odd, we get Ologn.p  pThe worst case will be composed of an array A of n even numbers, and for each the algorithm will run On. In other words, the worst case runtime for Algorithm S should be nOn.p  pThe best case will be composed of an array A of n odd numbers, and for each the algorithm will run Ologn. The best case runtime for algorithm S should be nOlogn.p  pAm I making any sense is it true then thatp  pBest case of algorithm S is nOlogn and worst case is nOnp  pIf that is true, can it be rewritten for example, as Olognn and Onn or is this an arithmetic mistakep  hr  pstrong2nd attemptstrongp  pFollowing JuanLopes response, it seems like I can rewrite nOn as Onn or On2, and nOlogn as Onlogn.p  pDoes it make sense now that Algorithm S runs at Onlogn at the best case, and On2 at the worst casep

Negative 7407 pMicroservices seem to be a very good fit for my software after watching and reading number of articles from Martin Fowler, Sam Newman, Adrian Cockcroft and Sudhir Tones. However, when thinking deeper into the implementation, there are number of concernsp  ol liMy software has an UI, lets call it a webbased component. This component will need to coordinateorchestrate calls to 1020 different microservices internally lets call it private microservices and return data to the AJAX call. Is it a good design to couple the orchestration logic in this component Or should I create another microservice that does the job and the webbased component should be very thin to delegate the call to this microserviceli liI will need to expose some public APIs. Should I have a separate layer to delegate the call like in the case above li ol  pI think it might be more or less about the design pattern for publicprivate microservices. p  pWhat would be a good pattern to address the above concernsp  pstrongUpdated on 9 Apr 2015strongp  pAPI Gateway Pattern actually addresses my concerns. I also agree with other answers regarding EAI patterns or security consideration.p  pTo extend more regarding my findings, I think Netflix architecture is having, socalled edge service, which is the front tier that is serving requests coming from either webbased or devices and the middletier services are actually your microservices. So i think to promote a middletier service to be an edgeservice, this has to be a delegate. It will keep the middletier clean and consistent. p  pHave a look at a hrefhttpsgithub.comcfreglyfluxcapacitorprojectoverview relnofollowhttpsgithub.comcfreglyfluxcapacitorprojectoverviewa to have more ideas.p

Negative 7407 pI am building a node.js application and have a set of attributes that I need to look up on every action they are associated with permissions.  I am using a mysql database as my persistant storage.   I was initially going to use redis to store these attributes as they dont change that much and so can be loaded from the mysql database when the application is started and refreshed if they ever change.  The point being that I need the lookup to be quick as possible since it happens often, but the data doesnt need to persist so redis instead of mysql.p  pAs I was thinking about this today, it occurred to me that I could maybe use a global associative array to store this data.  I am always going to be looking things up by the same key and always getting the full list of attributes. I figure that when I start the application on the server, it can just load the data into an array attached to the global object in node rather than sticking it into redis so I can reduce the complexity of the app stack.   Plus Im assuming that the javascript array would be a faster lookup as well since its less overhead.p  pAm I missing something  Is there something about the way either redis or the global object in node works that would make the former faster   I anticipate the most likely situation would be 100s of keys but there could be situations where I could have 10000s.   That still doesnt seem too big in the grand   scheme of things though.p

Negative 7407 pI asked a question on how to save checkbox state using a textfile but was recommended to use shared preferences.

Negative 7407 pDistributed System being the correct term i think.p  pAt the moment i am developing a webapp. I am developing it locally, and when it goes into Beta it will be running on one machine, a Linode server probably.p  pThe thing is, this application will be handling and processing large amounts of data based on user requests, and will have numerous scripts running fulltime in the background of the server performing data processing. There wont be a massive amount of users using this system during Beta testing, so one machine will probably have enough resources to run the application smooth enough.p  pBut i cant imagine scaling this application on machine. So probably in the future i will have to spread the application across a distributed system.p  pI have no idea what this would involve and find it hard to find simplistic material about this subject online.p  pI have ideas on how it might be divided up though. The application is consists of a PHP framework, a MySQL database and has some Python scripts that will be ran forever handling automated tasks and data processing.p  pMaybe each seperate part gets its own machine, the PHP on one machine, this is the one that handles user requests and the related processing, the database on its own machine, and the Python scripts running on their own machine.p  pBut i have absolutely no idea how this might be achievedp  pWhat i would really like is if you guys could give some simple explanations, or a general overview, of how you would divide up an application across multiple machines. Technologies involved, general concepts, anythingp  pany help or discussion greatly appreciated Thanksp

Negative 7407 pCurrently I am working on a hospital queue system. I have a long called Time in the patient constructor. The time is set to the system.milliseconds. The method below is part of thread. It contains and iterator that gets the patients time and compares it to the current system time. Once the patients time reaches 2 minutes I want to move the element that has reached two minutes to the top of the queue. Every element that reaches 2 minutes should be moved to the top of the queue thereafter and ordered. The linkedlist is ordered by the patients severity automatically however if a patient is waiting too long they will be moved to the front. Hence the 2 minute intervals. p  precodeListIteratorltPatientgt checktime  MainPatientQueue.patientslist.listIterator              whilechecktime.hasNext                  Patient P  checktime.next                  long max  120000                 long start  P.getTime                    long end  System.currentTimeMillis                  System.out.printlnendstart                      ifendstartgtmax                        MainPatientQueue.patientslist.removeP                      MainPatientQueue.patientslist.add0, P                                      codepre  pOverall, I would like to know if there is a method that I can use within an iterator to move elements Currently I am throwing a concurrent modification exception each time I try to move an element.p  pThank you M Shaw.

Negative 7407 pCurrently Im working on a project where a user enters a lot of data constantly for a hour long window.  Im looking to have one user control all the data via some control panel and then have a link they can distribute to other users that will allow them to view that data without the ability to edit it.p  pRight now Im doing some extremely weird methods. I have an XHR request on the control page that fires whenever a field is finished being edited.  From there the data is sent to a php file that converts the data into a simple text file.  Then the distributed link file will load that file one time and translate it into the necessary format.  p  pSome potential problems Ive run into are it seems odd that Im sending starting as javascript data then going to a php file then to a text file then translating the data all the way back into javascript data again.  Another problem Ive come into is Im not sure of a way to force users to reload the page when a field is edited in the control panel after the user has opened the view page.p  pHave I totally gone overboard here What are some better concepts I could employ to accomplish this taskp

Negative 7407 pI set up a node js web server, which is serving images links in a JSON file. One link is referring to an image on the internet, and the other link is referring to a local directory in my home server.p  pThe web server is online, not on my home server. emFor bandwidth usage purposesem, the web server is only serving image links. If the client is connected trough my home connection, it uses the local link, and if it is not, it uses the internet link.p  pCurrently, I serve a JSON file containing the links, and always select the internet one, on the client side, because I do not know how to make the client understand that he is on my local network.p  pIs there something existing I have done research about getting the mac address of the router first hop, the network ssid, ... but it doesnt seem to be achievable only with JavaScript.p  pso, basically, here is my setup p  pstrongHome network strongp  ul liHome server images stored locallyli liPotential client connected through this connectionli ul  pstrongWebhosted content strongp  ul liWeb server node jsli liFTP images storedli liPotential client connectedli ul  pIn any situation, the client needs an internet connection, since the node server is online. However, if the client is on the same my local network network as the local home server, he should use the local links for getting image.p  pI need one of these two solutions  p  ul liThe client knows if he is on my local network, and then picks up the  good linkli liThe web server knows where the client comes from, and serves directly the good link so, no problem on client side.

Negative 7407 pI am using a MVC application that is retrieving a Webhook Json Payload.

I have to use a try catch to prevent the runtime error.p  pSo how can I prevent the runtime error and display the details in a viewBag like this p  precodeViewBag.result  issue.issue.key codepre  pThe email will have the correct information eg  OP155 Reopened, that will change it the issue changes so it is getting the correct information but for some reason when it is read in it is null and breaks the application adding a try catch prevents the application from breaking which allows it to send the issue information, how is this possible and how can I fix thisp  pIs there any way that I can implement something that will only display on the screen when a value is changed in a variable or it has a value in it.  How would I implement an update type function that runs constantly in MVC Would I have to use jQuery p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThe reason this happens is because of the sequence of events that leads to the error,  Firstly I will submit a HTTP Post to JIRA, which will then simultaneously redirect to the submit success View page, but also fire a webhook from JIRA to my submit success page to show that it has been submitted.  p  pThe problem is that my application is then first using a HTTP GET to retrieve the View page, then the application will not display the HTTP POST from JIRA, but storing it in a trycatch block to prevent a run time error of null, it will store the value in the correct variable once the webhook successfully hits the application, then it will send it in an email because it does not require a HTTP GET POST to do so.p

Negative 7407 pAfter reading about how to ensure that remember me tokens are kept secure and reading the source code for psecios Gatekeeper PHP library, Ive come up with the following strategy for keeping things secure, and I wanted to find out if this is going to go horribly wrong. Im basically doing the following thingsp  ol liWhen a user logs in, generate a cryptographicallysecure string using the systems random number generator. random.SystemRandom in Python This is generated by picking random characters from the selection of all lower and uppercase ASCII letters and digits. code.joinrandomgen.choicerandomchars for i in rangelengthcode, as per how Django does the same. coderandomgencode is the secure random number generatorli liThe generated token is inserted into a RethinkDB database along with the userid it goes along with and an expiration time 1 minute into the future. A cookie value is then created by using the unique ID that RethinkDB generates to identify that entry and the sha256hashed token from before. Basically code.joinuniqueid, sha256crypt.encrypttokencode. sha256crypt is from Pythons passlib library.li liWhen a user accesses a page that would require them to be logged in, the actual cookie value is retrieved from the database using the ID that was stored. The hashed cookie is then verified against the actual cookie using codesha256crypt.verifycode.li liIf the verification passes and the time value previously stored is less than the current time, then the previous entry in the database is removed and a new IDtoken pair is generated to be stored as a cookie.li ol  pIs this a good strategy, or is there an obvious flaw that Im not seeingp  pEDIT After rereading some Stack Overflow posts that I linked in a comment, I have changed the process above so that the database stores the hashed token, and the actual token is sent back as a cookie. which will only happen over https, of coursep

I used codeCountdownTimercode to achieve this. It worked fine it sends codeLatLngscode as long as I move. But, if I stop before the ArrayList fills it sends the ArrayList whatever it has after 20 minutes. Not a problem with that. But, after that it keeps sending SMS in one minute interval.

Negative 7407 pIn my android project, in one of the layout.xml I have a listview and below it I have an editText and below this editText I make a keyboard to appear. Well. Everything happens fine in certain devices. In certain devices, what happens is, that when the keyboard appears it pushes the editText pushing upwards and hence the user is unable to use this editText . When I analyzed, I found that  this problamatic keyboard was with a number row or a speaker row on top of the  normal keyboard. I dont want this type keyboard.

I dont just want to link to some other website that makes everything easy for me.  I want to learn how this is done.li liJQuery I have not taught myself any JQuery yet.  I would like to do this in only CSS3, HTML5, and a bit of JS if that is possible.  I know JQuery is powerful and I am getting to it.

Please let me know your thoughts.li ul  pWhat I have gathered from my research is that Im looking to make an SVG Scalable Vector Graphics image of the world and regions I want selected.  I am rather good at Photoshop and Illustrator so this should be no problem.  From there I am going to need to use coordinates and apply it with map or area tags.  And then from there Im not sure what to do.  Also I have gathered I cannot do this with just CSS and HTML, but also need a little Javascript but JQery seems optional and I definitely dont want to use Flash.p  pQuestionsp  ul liDoes anyone have a good step by step tutorial on this featureli liDo I really need to use plugins to make this workli liUpsides and downsides to JQuery use for thisli ul  pAny pushes in the right direction, any tips you learned on image mapping, and any articles on things I may encounter while building this map are GREATLY appreciated.
