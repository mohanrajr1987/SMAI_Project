I define the following classp  precodeclass SetOfDataPoints  public QGraphicsItem  public   ltconstructorgt   QRectF boundingRect const  ...    void paintQPainter painter,              const QStyleOptionGraphicsItem option,              QWidget widget  NULL  ...    ltother methodsgt  codepre  pAt regular intervals, I read a new data point, add it to the instance of codeSetOfDataPointscode, and shift the codeSetOfDataPointscode to the left by calling codeQGraphicsItemmoveBycode on the codeSetOfDataPointscode, so the new data point becomes visible. As a result, codeSetOfDataPointspaintcode gets called, and in that method I have to draw the strongentirestrong set of data points. The drawing currently consists only of line segments that connect the data points, but will become more elaborate in the future.p  pNow, it feels inefficient to redraw the whole set of data points, when most of the graph is actually just shifted to the left. I would like to shift the pixels of the unchanged part of the graph to the left, and draw only the one line segment that connects the last two points. At least I would like to try, and measure how much that improves performance.p  pIs there a way to do that in Qt 4.8p

Positive 5832 h2The Problem h2  pI have an application, from which I open a modless child window by clicking on a button. This child window contains an embedded matplotlib figure. I would like this child window to be destroyed, along with the matplotlib figure, after is has been closed.p  pThe problem is that, even though the child window seems to be properly deleted on the Qt side, there seems to be no memory deallocated from the process. The problem seems to be cumulative, i.e. the memory taken up by my application increases if I open multiple child windows and then close them manually with X.p  pemMy system em Ubuntu 15.04  Matplotlib 1.4.2  python 2.7.9 or 3.4.3  PySide 1.2.2p  pemNote em I currently circumvent the memory leak problem by not destroying the child window and reusing the same artists to update the figure with new data. I would like however to be able to release completely the memory taken up by this child window when it is not needed.p  h2What Ive tried so far h2  pIve tried all the combination I could think of with codegc.collectcode, codesetParentNonecode, codedeleteLatercode, codedelcode, codesetattributesQtCore.Qt.WADeleteOnClosecode, Ive tried to be extra careful with the namespace and to use only weak links to matplotlib artists, Ive also tried with and without using codepyplotcode, but with no real success... Ive been able to release some of the memory taken by the matplotlib child windows by reimplementing the codecloseEventcode method of the child window class and cleaning stuff manually, but still, its not working perfect and its not pretty.p  pBelow is a MCVE that illustrates the problem with a basic implementation of the best solution I have so far.

Below is an extract of the relevant part of the current code.p  pWhat is blocking me right now is how to implement the highlighting for titles underlined with codecode, for the main title, or codecode for subtitles. The method that is used by QtPySide to highlight the text is a hrefhttpdoc.qt.ioqt4.8qsyntaxhighlighter.htmlhighlightBlock relnofollowhighlightBlocka, which processes only one line at a time.p  precodeclass MySyntaxHighlighterQtGui.QSyntaxHighlighter     def highlightBlockself, text          do something with this line of text         self.setCurrentBlockState0         startIndex  0         if self.previousBlockState  1             startIndex  self.blockStartExpression.indexIntext          while startIndex gt 0             endIndex  self.blockEndExpression.indexIn                 text, startIndex             ... codepre  pThere is a way to recover the codepreviousBlockStatecode, which is useful when a block has a defined start for instance, the codecode syntax at the beginning of a codeblock. Unfortunately, there is nothing that defines the start of a title, except for the underlining with codecode or codecode that take place on the next line. All the examples I found only handle cases where there is a defined start of the expression, and so that the codepreviousBlockStatecode gives you an information as in the example above.p  pThe question is then strongis there a way to recover the text of the next line, inside the highlightBlockstrong To perform a lookahead, in some sense.p  pI though about recovering the document currently being worked on, and find the current block in the document, then find the next line and make the regular expression check on this. This would however break if there is a line in the document that has the exact same wording as the title. Plus, it would become quite slow to systematically do this for all lines in the document. Thanks in advance for any suggestion.p
Positive 5832 pThere is a change between QT4 and QT5 when handling Menubar menus access keys and QActions shortcuts that have conflicting key combinations.p  pIn Qt4 when a MenuBar contains a menu with an ampersand like ampFile it can be opened by tapping on Alt and then tapping F.  If a QAction is created using the same hotkey combination like AltF then the QAction s signal will be fired if Alt and F are pushed simultaneously or alt is held down and F is pushed.br This is similar functionality to Visual Studios and other MS programs.p  pIn Qt5.4 and Qt5.5 when a MenuBar contains a menu with an ampersand like ampFile it can be opened by tapping on Alt and then tapping F. If a QAction is created using the same hotkey combination like AltF then the QAction s signal will be NOT fired.  Instead nothing happens and a warning message is sent to the application output.p  pQActioneventFilter Ambiguous shortcut overload AltFp  pThis issue can be duplicated using a QTcreator example like menus and changing the setshortcut for newAct to AltF or another shortkey that is the same as a menubar.p  precodefileMenu  menuBargtaddMenutrampFile fileMenugtaddActionnewAct  void MainWindowcreateActions      newAct  new QActiontrampNew, this     newActgtsetShortcuttrAltF   This will work in QT4 but not in QT5 and will send a message QActioneventFilter Ambiguous shortcut overload AltF     newActgtsetStatusTiptrCreate a new file     connectnewAct, SIGNALtriggered, this, SLOTnewFile codepre  pMy question is what is the correct functionality for windows QT4 or Qt5.  If QT5 is correct is there a way to setup Qt so it acts like QT4 instead.p

Negative 5832 pIm currently using Eclipselink, but I know now days most JPA implementations have been pretty standardized. Is there a native way to map a JPA entity to a view I am not looking to insertupdate, but the question is really how to handle the Id annotation. Every entity in the JPA world must have an ID field, but many of the views I have created do not conform to this. Is there native support for this in the JPA or do I need to use hacks to get it to work Ive searched a lot and found very little information about doing this.p

Negative 5832 pMy application will have a per machine not per user Startup shortcut.  I can create a shortcut during the installer process no problem.  My problem comes when the user later removes it and then tries to reenable.  In otherwords, they turn off RunOnStartup which deletes the Startup ink and at a later time they decide they do want it to run on startup so they go back into preferences and reenable.    p  pApparently, this is a pretty common gripe with .NET that there isnt a native way to create shortcuts.  But, havent found a very good solution.p  pSolutions Ive FoundConsidered p  ul lipRather then create a shortcut.  Just copy one.  This might be a good solution.  I cant depend on there being a Start Menu link.  But, I guess I could probably create one and keep it in Program Directory... This shifts the problem over to my installer to have to create the shortcut with the appropriate path which would be specified at install time.  pli lipDo what a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions234231howdoyoucreateanapplicationshortcutlnkfileincornetthis other stackoverflow answera is and use a COM wrapper object.  Id like to avoid COM.  It was also written in 2003.  So, Im not sure how well its going to support vista.  Id give it a shot but dont have a vista box handy.  pli lipUse the registry instead.  This is how I currently do it... but run into issues on Vista.  It seems the general consensus that Startup Menu shortcuts are the proper way to do this so thats what my goal is.pli ul  pAlso, I have to handle the case that a regular user not an admin tries to change this preference.  In this case, I need to gracefully fail or in the case of vista allow the user to enter the Admin password to get a Admin security token.  An answer which already properly takes into consider this case would be awesome.  p  pI apologize if this topic has already been covered.  I searched around before posting. p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Copying a shortcut which your installer created is the best solution.  Ill post code once finished... ran into some hurdles with a Environment.GetSpecialFolder not having a reference to the StartMenu which has been resolved...

Negative 5832 pI am spending a good amount of time trying to figure out why Linq2Sql is changing my SQL query.  It is rather difficult to explain, and I cant find any reason why this is happening.  The low down is it appears that adding multiple contains around an IQueryable seems to overwrite each previous IQueryable Expression. Let me try and explainp  pSay you have a Linq2Sql query that provides you the basic framework for query. something that is the base of all your queriesp  pI am dynamically adding in parts of the where query shown as partQuery in the examples below.  The Expression generated from the where query is correct, and when I add it to the finalQuery  it still is correct. The problem comes when I add another partQuery to the final query, it seems to overwrite the first query in the final query, but adds a second query into it. or as shown below, when adding a thrid query, overwrites the first 2 queriesp  pHere is some source examplep  precode        foreach var partQuery in whereStatements                      finalQuery  finalQuery.Where                 dataEvent gt partQuery.ContainsdataEvent.DataEventID                           codepre  pthe partQuery is of of type IQueryable finalQuery is the query that will eventually be executed at the SQL serverp  precode         the list of the wheres that are sent         var whereStatements  new ListltIQueryableltlonggtgt          var query1  DataEvent.GetQueryBasecontext         query1  query1.Where             dataEvent gt             dataEvent.DataEventKeyID  shortDataEventTypesEnum.TotalDollarAmount ampamp dataEvent.ValueDouble lt 50          whereStatements.Addquery1.Selectx gt x.DataEventID           var query2  DataEvent.GetQueryBasecontext         query2  query2.Where             dataEvent gt             dataEvent.DataEventKeyID  shortDataEventTypesEnum.ObjectNumber ampamp dataEvent.ValueDouble  6          whereStatements.Addquery2.Selectx gt x.DataEventID codepre  pThe first where Query query1 has an expression that turns out like thisp  pSELECT [t0].[DataEventID]  FROM [dbo].[DataEvents] AS [t0]  INNER JOIN [dbo].[DataEventAttributes] AS [t1] ON [t0].[DataEventID]  [t1].[DataEventID]  WHERE [t1].[DataEventKeyID]  p0 AND [t1].[ValueDouble] lt p1  p  pNotice that the where line has a ValueDouble lt p1  less thenp  pand then when added into the final query, it looks like thisp  pSELECT [t0].[DataEventID], [t0].[DataOwnerID], [t0].[DataTimeStamp]  FROM [dbo].[DataEvents] AS [t0]  WHERE EXISTS   SELECT NULL AS [EMPTY]   FROM [dbo].[DataEvents] AS [t1]   INNER JOIN [dbo].[DataEventAttributes] AS [t2] ON [t1].[DataEventID]  [t2].[DataEventID]   WHERE [t1].[DataEventID]  [t0].[DataEventID] AND [t2].[DataEventKeyID]  p0 AND [t2].[ValueDouble] lt p1    AND [t0].[DataOwnerID]  p2  p  pAt this point, the query is still correct. Notice how ValueDouble still has a lt sign.  The problem occurs when I add 2 or more to the query. Here is the expression of the second query in this examplep  pSELECT [t0].[DataEventID]  FROM [dbo].[DataEvents] AS [t0]  INNER JOIN [dbo].[DataEventAttributes] AS [t1] ON [t0].[DataEventID]  [t1].[DataEventID]  WHERE [t1].[DataEventKeyID]  p0 AND [t1].[ValueDouble]  p1  p  pand when added to the final query.. you will notice that the first query is no longer correct....

Is there a neat way to start listening to UDP Specifically Id love to be able to write a UDPController and have a particular method called on each Datagram message.

Negative 5832 h2The Situationh2  pI am creating a video training site for a client on the RackSpace Cloud using the traditional LAMP stack RackSpaces cloud has both Windows and LAMP stacks. The videos and other media files Im serving on this site need to be protected as my client charges money for access to them. There is no DRM or funny business like that, essentially we store the files outside of the web root and use PHP to authenticate users before they are able to access the files by using modrewrite to run the request through PHP.p  pSo lets say the user requests a file at this URLp  precodehttpwww.example.comuploadspreviewimage29.jpg codepre  pI am using modrewrite to rewrite that url top  precodehttpwww.example.comfiles.phppath2Fuploads2Fpreviewimage2F29.jpg codepre  pHere is a simplified version of the files.php scriptp  precodeltphp  Setups the environment and sets loggedin  This part requires SESSION requireonce....includesuserconfig.php  if loggedin       Redirect nonauthenticated users     headerLocation login.php    This user is authenticated, continue  contenttype  imagejpeg   getAbsolutePathForRequestedResource takes   a Query Parameter called path and uses DB  lookups and some string manipulation to get  an absolute path.

On local test machines it works like a charm. However once deployed to the cloud it stops working. After some debugging it turns out that if a request to the cloud has certain file extensions like .JPG, .PNG, or .SWF i.e. extensions of typically static media files. the request is routed to a cache system called Varnish. The end result of this routing is that by the time this whole process makes it to my PHP script the session is not present.p  pIf I change the extension in the URL to .PHP or if I even add a query parameter Varnish is bypassed and the PHP script can get the session. No problem right Ill just add a meaningless query parameter to my requestsp  pstrongHere is the rubstrong The media files I am serving through this system are being requested through compiled SWF files that I have zero control over. They are generated by thirdparty software and I have no hope of adding or changing the URLs that they request.p  pAre there any other options I have on thisp  pstrongUpdatestrong I should note that I have verified this behavior with RackSpace support and they have said there is nothing they can do about it.p

Negative 5832 pBasically, I simply want to do many searches on a given lucene index.p  pTherefore, I made a class Data with final analyzer, reader, searcher and parser fields, all properly initialized in the constructor. The class also provides a search method to search the index. This is all shown in the code below. p  pThe problem is however that memory gradually becomes filled after many calls to search with different queries. I did not check what happens when always the same query is used. I looked around already for possible answers, and it seems to be best practice to keep the searcher etc open across different searches, so I guess that is not the problem.

Negative 5832 pLets say theres a Teacher object and that Teachers holds a list of Courses objects. The courses for the Teacher can change. Some get added, some get deleted. Whats the best approach to update this changes in the database. 1. Right after every change, update the database. e.g. A course get added, immediately add that into the database as well . 2. After all changes are made to the entityobject Teacher courses are added, courses are deleted, only then update the database with all the changes. 3. Others p  pI can see for both 1 and 2 advantages and disadvantages. For 1 I dont know how good it is when data models have direct access to the database. For 2 The algorithm its more complex because you have to compare the information in the data models with information in the database all at once.p  pThank youp

Negative 5832 pIm having an issue with Nunit where I cannot find an image file when I run my tests and each time it looks for images it looks in the Nunit folder instead of looking inside the folder where the binary resides.  Below is a detailed description of whats happening.p  ol liIm building a binary that is under test which contains the definition for some game elements and png files which will define the sprites Im using for sanity sake call it Binary1li liNunit runs tests from a seperate binary Binary1Test executing test methods against the first binary Binary1.li liAll tests pass, unless the test executes code in Binary1 which then requires Binary1 to use one of the image files which are defined via a relative path.  When the method is called, Nunit throws a file not found exception stating that it cannot find the file and states its looking inside of the Program FilesNunit.net 2.0 folderli ol  pSo I have no idea why the code is doing this, and to make matters more confusing when I pull up Enviornment.CurrentDirectory it gives me the correct path the path to my debug folder and not the path to nunit.  Also if I use this instead of using the relative path, my tests will run without issue.  So my question is, does anyone know why in the case of loading relative paths from within my binary that nunit decides to use its directory instead of the directory where the binary is located and where the images are stored  Thanks.p

Negative 5832 pI have a few different applications that share some common DLLs. At the moment I am copying each DLL into the application root folder for each application and it all works fine.p  pObviously this isnt exactly the most efficient way as if I need to make a change in one, I need to redeploy this several times to all the different folders. Ideally I would like the DLLs to be installed into the codeCommoncode folder in the codeProgram Filescode dir and my application just pointing to them. I can do this through my setup application.p  pHowever, the issue is, how do I tell my application to look for those DLLs in the common folder and not its root I currently reference the DLLs by adding the actual Lib projects to the solution and then just adding them from the codeProjectscode tab. So in order for the application to realise it needs to look in the common do I need to move those files to that folder first and then reference them I would imagine there must be a neater way than thisp

Negative 5832 pFor an event system I need to check if there are enough resources available for an event. Events have a a start and end timestamp, and needs a number of resources for the sake of simplicity well assume that there is only 1 type of resource.

All events are doctrinebased php objects, the timestamps dont need to be any more specific than minutes.p  pIm running into troubles in an example like the followingp  ul li1 resource is needed from 1200 to 1300li li1 resource is needed from 1300 to 1400li lia new event is created that wants 1 resource from 1200 to 1400li ul  pLets assume we have a total of 2 resources, then this should be possible. I currently select all events that have an overlap with the new event so from 1200 to 1400, and take the sum of all resources needed by these events. This would mean that the new event is not possible.p  pHow can I check efficiently if a new event is possible Either using only a doctrine query, or making a basic selection using a doctrine query and doing filtering with php afterwards. The only solution I came up with so far is select all events from 1200 to 1400, and in check for every minute so 120 iterations if a resource is overbooked.p

Negative 5832 pThe time zone handling on the iPhone seems a little confusing to me.  As far as adding a new EKEvent to the device calendar it looks like you always just set the startend times in local time, there is no timezone or offset we need to work with.  Is this truep  pI assume the device knows the time zone at the time the entry is made.  The confusion comes in when you look at the devices SettingsMail, Contacts, Calendars and scroll to the bottom for the time zone data.  Whether to have time zone support ONOFF, a set time zone, etc.p  pSo if I am in California and add an event to the device and the time zone is set to New York and time zone support is ON, what time will the EKEvent actually show inp  pHas anyone dealt with the iOS calendar via EventKit and have lessons to learn regarding time zone handling  Or is it straightforward, just use the local time and enter the event and the device will take care of the restp  pThank you.p

Negative 5832 pHi All    I met a tricky problem here I need to read some files and convert its content into some XML files. For each line in the file, I believe most of them are valid ASCII code, so that I could just read the line into php and save the line into an XML file with default encoding XML as UTF8. However, I noticed that there might be some GBK, GB2312Chinese character, SJISJapanese characters etc.. existed in the original files, php have no problems to save the string into XML directly. However, the XML parser will detect there are invalid UTF8 codes and crashed. p  pNow, I think the best library php function for my purpose is probablyp  precode decodestr  mbconvertencodingstr, UTF8, auto codepre  pI try to run this conversation function for each line before inserting it into XML.

Negative 5832 pI would like to write an algorithm that compares one memory block with another and provides an objective value, so as to determine the quality of the match.  Ive investigated codememcmpcode, and all it is really useful for is to determine whether two memory blocks are identical or not.  Ive written a recursive function to accomplish this, but its not working quite right.p  precodeDWORD CMemoryCompare LPBYTE pDst, LPBYTE pSrc, DWORD len       DWORD dwDiff      if  len  0               dwDiff  0          else              dwDiff  pSrc  pDst  len   len is attempt to weight difference by MSB         dwDiff  thisgtCompare pSrc  1, pDst  1, len  1            return dwDiff  codepre  pThe idea is that the more closely the two memory spaces match, the lower the return value will be.  For example, lets say there are three memory blocks containing codeHello World 0 code, codeHello World 1 code, and codeHello World 2 code, respectively, and I would like to find out which memory block is a best match with candidate codehello world 1 code.  The idea is that I would run the codeComparecode function three times comparing the candidate with each memory block in turn, and codeComparecode should return the lowest value for the memory block containing codeHello World 1 code.  However, what its doing in reality, is returning the lowest value for the last memory block containing codeHellow World 2 code.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on how I can improve this function  Thanks.p
Negative 5832 pIm trying to reconcile the definition of referential transparency with how OCaml handles polymorphic types and sideeffects. I read on a hrefhttpwww.csc.villanova.edudmatuszeresourcesocamlocaml.html relnofollowhttpwww.csc.villanova.edudmatuszeresourcesocamlocaml.htmla thatp  blockquote   pA definition is said to have referential transparency if its meaning does not depend on the context it is in. Functions in OCaml have referential transparency, that is, changing the context other variables and other functions does not change the meaning of any functions you have already defined. This fact can be crucial when you are debugging a program, because you are likely to be redefining functions fairly frequently.p blockquote  pBut the way I understand things, this cant be true in OCaml because it is possible to perform a whole bunch of sideeffects like writing to files and performing other calculations before returning whatever was fed into the function.p  pYou could potentially have a function codef  string gt stringcode so that codef acode does not equal codef acode.  We can drop in some sideeffecting expressions into the body of the function that are completely invisible in the type description of codefcode.p  pAs an example codefcode could be defined to return the first line of some file.  There could be a function somewhere in the context of codefcode that is changed which affects what first line codefcode returns.  Or worse, some function in the context could delete the file that codefcode depends on which would make codefcode undefined. p  pSo is OCaml referentially transparent or am I missing somethingp

Negative 5832 pI have developed a quiz application using flash. The swf file calls a couple xml files to populate its questions and other aspects of the quiz. At the conclusion of the quiz, the user has the opportunity to submit their score. The user enters hisher name and email and click submit. The site then uses a php file to send an email to me with the users name score and the time they took the quiz. I uploaded the php to our godaddy hosting account and left the rest of the site on my desktop for testing and tweaking. In this configuration entire site minus php local everything worked fine with sending the emails and such and calling to the php out on the server. When I move the site up to the godaddy server the quiz works fine, but the email will not send even though it is calling the same php file as beforep  pAny ideas on how I can look into the issues would be much appreciated.p  pother info I have tried moving the php file and changing the necessary paths in my code to different levels of the directory with no luck. I am really stumped as to why it works when i run the html quiz pages from my desktop but not when they are up on the server with the php file.p

Negative 5832 pI am working on a Silverlight 4 project where I get a memory leak because every time some xaml views are loaded they create their own instance of a class that then gets hooked with event triggers and dont get garbage collected. Removing the event listeners has proved too tricky under the circumstances for me to handle it that way. So Instead I want the instance of the class to be reused every time the xaml view loads.p  pTo do this I was planning on adding a Resource Dictionary to each project that this error is occurring in. My concern though is that I dont know when this Resource Dictionary will be created. When the solution first loads will it load the project then the resource dictionary, immediately creating the class for use Or will it wait until something asks for it and then create it. Will what actually happens create a copy of the class that gets reused by everyone that accesses itas in not another copyp  pI also realize I can place the resources in app.xaml but I need to add many such classes and it will really clutter up the area which shouldnt be bothered with this problem.p

Negative 5832 pI wanted to know if there exists a somewhat simple, but secure, method to encrypt stringsnot passwords, with a password which is not stored on the server, in PHP.p  pIve checked a hrefhttpwww.tonymarston.netphpmysqlencryption.htmlA reversible password encryption routine for PHPa, but Im unsure if it is secure enough if intruders have access to the server and source.p  pWere talking about a automatic system where a computer sends a request to a server, which stores information in a log. So Im thinking I could send the encryption password in the request header, preferably encrypted, but then it would be difficult to decrypt without storing the password somehow on the server. Wait, I think i might be complicating things a bit too much, but I hope you get the idea... Its meant to keep the information safe, even if hackers have full control over the server.p

In my SQL database, the table.field corresponding to those workings is job.phase, so when I put, in my report details, the field job.phase, I get 3 rows for that job.p  pThe point is that my report printout always has to show 5 different text objects one below the other, corresponding to the descriptions of all the 5 possible table.fieldrecords, and a X should appear next to text objects when each one of the workings listed there is a part of my job otherwise nothing should appear. p  pWhat I have done is the following  created a subreport containing the job.phase field  put it near my first text object  specified in my subreport the following show string formula    emif codejob.phasecode  working1 then X else em  and it works a X appears if working1 is part of my job, nothing appears if working1 is not part of my job. Then I have created 4 subreports more, equal to the first one, and specified the same for job.phase  working2, working3, working4 and working5, strongBUTstrong, after doing that, no X is shown even though working 1, 2 and 3 are part of my job...p  pIs there anybody who can help me, please Its so frustrating...p

Negative 5832 pI am a .NET Developer and as part of a refactoring project, I have a few questions.p  pOur software is currently using an Active Record pattern one to one mapping between the data objects and the business objects. The bad thing is that the business objects inherits from the data objects, inducing highly couple between the layers.p  pOur goal is to switch from our custom data access layer based on ADO.NET to Entity Framework. The constraint we have is not to break the code so that our older applications will still compile and run using the old data access layer while allowing us to use EF for the new projects.p  pMy first idea to do so is to break the inheritance and have the data object as an attribute of the business object and use an interface or abstract class in order to inject the data object, whether it is our custom layer or Entity Framework. The properties would be migrated from the Data objects to the business objects which would act like some kind of proxy to access the properties of the data objects.p  pWould that be a viable solution  That would still use the active record pattern and I dont like this a lot, since our business layer has become quite large so if you have any other idea, please dont hesitate.p  pMy other question is about the Entity framework generation. We need the entities properties to have the same name as the old data objects we would use an abstract class in order to allow the business objects to call the properties of the data object, whether it is our custom data object or the EF entities. What would be the best way to accomplish that  Using T4 to generate the entities or have an EF Code first approach p  pI am very open to any suggestion, so please do not hesitate to propose other approaches. Thanks for your time.p

I stepped through the AuthenticationLoggedIn eventhandler in LoginStatus.xaml and for some reason the users AvatarURL property is only a partial value. If the value in the database is httplocalhost52878ImagesDefault.jpg. The value I get when I do the stepthrough is httplocalhost528.p  pI have double checked the database values and ensured they are correct. If I input the XAML Images Source value manually httplocalhost52878ImagesDefault.jpg it displays the image no problem. It appears to be a problem between the communication between the silverlight app and the asp.net website project. Due to the fact Ive only made miniscule changes to the solution, and written none of the code that wires the 2 projects together, I have no idea where to look to solve this problem, anyone have any ideasp  pI can post some code if necessary but its not much different than the default business template.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5832 pstrongSummarystrongp  pI want to write a .png file as quickly as possible, without a concern for compression. That is, I dont care much about the file size, but I do care that the write happens as quickly  as possible.p  pstrongMotivationstrongp  pI am making a webbased map application using OpenLayers on the client side and pythonC on the back end. The application needs to be able to draw dynamic content quickly as the user moves around the map. I have both tilebased 256x256 tile and singleimagebased single tile versions working, but in both cases the slowest part of the backend render is actually saving the image as a png file whether ondisk or inmemory. For instance, I may be able to generate a raw, tga, or tiff version of a certain view in about 200 ms, but it takes more like 1.2 seconds to generate the .png version just because the .png save takes almost a full second, whereas the time to actually save the other formats is 100 ms or less and even though the raw file is five times the size of the .png file. And this file save time is also significantly more than the time to transfer the resulting image from the server to the client. One important property of my app is that in general the back end will be running on the same machine as the browser, so transfer times are negligible, even for largeish files.p  pI thought I could make .png writes fast when using libpng from C by callingp  precode    pngsetcompressionlevel pngptr, 0  codepre  pbefore calling any codepngwrite...code functions. However, while that call does indeed seem to stop libpng from compressing the file the resulting file is about the same size as the .raw file, it doesnt make saving the .png noticeably faster.p  pstrongPlease helpstrongp  pI need to use .png for these image, because I need them to be transparent overlays on top of the base map, and I need more than the 256 colors offered by GIF. OpenLayers is simply using html img tags, so my understanding is that I can only use valid img formats.p  pI would think there would be a way of writing a .png file quickly by not doing any real compression I understand that .png is always compressed but I imagined this could include null compression. It seems like you should be able to write like a simple fixed header, followed by the uncompressed data, followed by some fixed footer. Or maybe that same idea but in a linebyline way. The point being that I can do all sorts of looping through this 2.5 MB of raw data in memory in C very quickly, and can dump it to various file formats very quickly, so it seems like I should be able to dump it in a fixed, uncompressed .png format quickly also.p  pDoes that sound right Do you know where I can find examples of code that does thatp

Negative 5832 pI have a codeoracle stored proccode that needs to be called from my Java program. I had used codeCallableStatementcode to pass parameters to the stored proc. I am using oracle thin driver configured in web logic server against the relevant jndi entry.This stored proc does not have any OUT values. This stored proc accepts a numeric value and does a lot of updates in the db based on the value received. p  pI get a connection object and then call this stored proc in loop 20 times for passing 20 numbers. When I directly call this stored proc from an oracle client , the execution gets completed in 23 seconds. However the behaviour is not predictable from my java code. Some of the calls take even 3040 seconds to get completed. p  pI tried to use codePreparedStatementcode instead of codeCallableStatementcode and could see marginal performance improvement though the behaviour is still inconsistent.p  ol liIs it OK in my case to use codePreparedStatementcode instead of codeCallableStatementcode given that the storedproc does not have any OUT parametersli liIs there any reason why codePreparedStatementcode has some performance gain over codeCallableStatementcode or is it something that I might have observed incorrectlyli liIs there a better approach for solving this performance issueli ol

Negative 5832 pI have developers working on the backend of my app using phonegap and once the user clicks facebooktwitter share a browser pops up and you can log in and share but after that you cannot escape back to the app, if you get out of the apps altogether then try and return to my app youre right back at the facebooktwitter screen instead of in my app.  This is only happening on iphon because on android they have a back button.  The only way to get back into the app is to restart the iphoneipod to get back to open the app from beginning.  I cannot have this as the only option for people to share from my app as it would be horrible and could ruin my app before I launch it.  They say their is no way to fix it but Im sure its fixable so I am trying to get any info on this that I can.p  pThe other issue is the facebook post itself. currently it post like thisp  pSent from Appnamewith link to app www.appname Text herep  pbut this is kinda counter intuitive because the actual message should be on top otherwise it will get lost in the other text.  They said this is the only way facebook allows it.  Is it possible to get it like thisp  pText here Sent from appnamelinke here www.appname.comp  pAgain any help on these two issues would be great so I can pass the info to my developers.p

Negative 5832 pIm working on a program in C that takes screenshots of a potion of the users screen. For the most pert it works as it should, but Ive recently run into one issue. There seems to be at least one pixel color that always appears as transparent in the output image. Any instance of the color 0D0B0C RGB 13, 11, 12 appears transparent in the saved png. This is with the PixelFormat set to Format32bppArgb. If I set it to Format32bppRgb or Format24bppRgb, that same pixel color appears as black in the saved png.p  pI have no idea what could be causing this, but the only thing Ive been able to do to fix it is to clear the graphics object to that color before doing CopyFromScreen. Im loathe to do that though for a few reasons. First, I dont know if thats the only color that has the issue what with 16,777,216 colors theres quite a few possibilities, and second, I hate hack fixes, this seems like a hack fix.p  pCan anyone shed any light on what might be causing this issue Ive messed with the PixelFormat on the bitmap creation and with the CopyPixelOperation in the CopyFromScreen method, nothing seems to work. The fact that clearing the graphics object to that color fixes it seems to tell me that the transparency is coming from the screen data itself, but that doesnt make sense. Ive been staring at this for too long, I think I need a fresh perspective on it. If anyone has any idea why this might be happening Id love to hear it. Thank you.p

Negative 5832 pI am writing a view controller for adding a new item to my app. It is a perfect fit for MonoTouch.Dialog, as it can be done easily with a table based interface, with a field per relevant property of my item.p  pThis is the code I have currently for showing the add item view simplified, but the core idea remainsp  precodeItem item  new Item TapHandler handler  new TapHandler  BindingContext bc  new BindingContexthandler, item, Add Item DialogViewController dv  new DialogViewControllerbc.Root, true this.NavigationController.PushViewControllerdv, true codepre  pWhile that works, I would prefer if I could encapsulate the details of the view into its own view controller, so the code could look like thisp  precodeUIViewController controller  new AddItemViewController this.NavigationController.PushViewControllercontroller, true codepre  pHowever, I cant figure out how to implement this. I thought the logical thing to do would be to make a subclass of codeDialogViewControllercode. However, all the constructors of codeDialogViewControllercode require a codeRootElementcode. To get that, you need to firstly create the codeBindingContextcode. As you cant run any code before calling the base constructor, it doesnt end up working.p  pMy second approach was to implement subclass of codeUIViewControllercode, create the codeDialogViewControllercode, and the add the dialog view controller as a child of my subclass using codethis.AddChildViewControllerdvcode and codethis.View.AddSubViewdv.Viewcode. While this works initially, if you have the new view controller in a UINavigationController, and you click a date element, the date view appears as a modal popup rather than in the navigation controller hierarchy. This makes sense, as the codeDialogViewControllercode isnt part of the codeNavigationControllercode hierarchy in this design.p  pFrom there Im stuck. I couldnt find any examples of using MonoTouch.Dialog like this in the examples either. Is this possible to do Or if its not, is there a good reason as to why writing code like this is a bad ideap

Negative 5832 pIm working on an application that process pipelines in separate threads.

Not a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8733857mvc3overridevalidationmessagecssthis questiona, the accepted answer just ADDS the class, I want to override it completely. In looking at the MVC3 source Ive found the codeValidationInputCssClassNamecode property on the HtmlHelper class. It is settable and it stores the value in a storage provider if set. The get method for the property returns [the provider value] codecode [the default class name].p  pNow if you just type in codeHtmlHelper.ValidationInputCssClassNamecode a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.mvc.htmlhelper.validationinputcssclassname.aspxMSDN entrya in your controller code youll see that it is a static readonly field.

Negative 5832 pI am creating an app where there is a page which enables users to create a small project, I mean painting with the brush, adding labels, text fields, and adding UIImageViews and placing an image in them using the iOS library. then a screenshot is taken for now and it is uploaded on dropbox. from a tableview the users will be able to see all the uploaded documents. but the point is that it is only a screenshot. I wanted to upload things in a way that the textfields could be scrolled, and when I add the video feature, see the video. then add comments. I thought of uploading all the images, photos, textviews separately, and then save all the position of the pieces in an XML, so that the projects can be viewed from the table view when a row is selected the app opens the XML and in base of that composes all the pieces like a puzzle. I decided to use Google library, data, but I cant seem to find where to download the sample project with the library. so I put it at a side. I then tried to use NSXML parser, but I only see tutorials that enable asccess to an xml file, not actually create one according to each project Help How can I proceed Any suggestions or tutorials May be were to give me the link to data project, and please not to the google developer page or trunk, because it is a messp  pthanks for the help in advancep

Negative 5832 pWell the basic idea is to get the wrapper automaticaly expand height depending on the height of the children. The problem though is that the menu child has a float attr, and if its bigger than content  its simply sticking out, this you can see by loading the code. I dont like playing with relative position, tablecells.. And if I set floatleft on the wrapper it actually bugs my whole markup for some reason.

Negative 5832 pIve been looking at performance tuning an environment and Ive setup a number of parameters to improve NFS performance, from the simple things like setting mount options, to the advanced like setting sysctl parameters and even considered enabling jumbo frames on the NICs and firewall.p  pIm running NFS and memcached on the same server, and I feel like I could possibly gain a performance improvement by removing the memcached networking overhead.p  pSome environment info is in order firstp  p4 load balanced web servers in a dsr setup, connected to an ASA 5510. 2 mysql servers in mastermaster replication. 1 appfile server running memcached and nfs.p  pAdding additional servers is not on the table for discussion.p  pWeb servers serve their content off of exported NFS mounts. NFS mounts on the web servers are setup to use udp instead of tcp.p  pWeb servers run varnish in front of apachephp, varnish is setup to only serve images, css, and javascript, via separate subdomains for each.p  pSite loads within 5 seconds most of the time, but occasionally, even at night when traffic is low, we will see it take longer to load. Sometimes its up to 10 seconds. Sure thats not bad, but theres no reason we shouldnt be able to see better performance. All files are served over NFS. By the way I acquired this customer recently, after their original tech switched positions.p  pWhat I thought I couldshould do since the server is optimized now for NFS connections, was to setup memcached to run in unix socket mode, which disables its network functionality, and then place the unix socket on an exported filesystem. That way the web servers could still connect to memcached, but it would remove some of the overhead because I have NFS mounts running udp instead of tcp.p

Since the current sub menu ul is outputting the dark gradient background I cannot use another background image.

Negative 5832 pIm working on a control where youd have two multiselect lists with collections of items that can be moved between one another.p  pTheres a possibility that the contents of one or both lists will be wider than Id like the item itself to be, and so I have them each represented by two divs and a select as followsp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt     ltdiv classconcealergt         ltselect size4gt             ...         ltselectgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pPutting the select within a div allows horizontal scrolling since select doesnt.  The select is resized size attribute is set to fit its contents as items are added or removed.  The concealer div avoid double scroll bars hides the vertical scroll bar on the select, and it is vertically sized when the select changes as well.p  pIm using html5.  IE9 in standards mode and Firefox are fine.  The problem that Im having is with Chrome actually Safari as well, so... webkit.  If the control is in a window or container a div for example with vertical scrolling, and you have it scrolled to the point where you cant see the top of the select, if the bottom of the select is visible or would be visible in the outer container, if overflow could be seen, when you click an item in the select, causing the select to focus, Chrome scrolls the outer container either to its top or far enough so that the top of the select would be visible if you could see it through the divs which contain it.p  pAs noted, if the bottommost option in the select is visible in the containing window, but the top of the select is not, chrome will scroll.p  pI have written script to adjust the scrollTop of the scrolled window back to its current position, and that emwouldem work, except that I am finding that in my staging and production environments, the adjustment being done by chrome is also causing the actual option selection to happen AFTER chrome has done its own adjustment, which means the click registers on the wrong option its off by however much the browser scrolled up, Its a problem whether theres an onfocus event on the select or not.p  pI havent been able to get the option select problem to happen in a barebones test like this, but the scrolling itself is a problem.p  pThe only way Ive found to prevent this from happening is to size the select to some number thats large enough to put the bottom of the select well outside the bottom of the outer container, but this is not at all ideal, as it leaves lots of whitespace, is a bad user experience, and fights a problem that while fairly profound only affects webkit.p  pDoes anyone know how else I might prevent or counteract this behaviorp  pI did have images to go with this, but understandably, new users cant post images.

Negative 5832 pOk, I know there are similar questions out there, so before you say go google it I have already tried and it seems my situation is unique. Once again, I have an arrayList of Student objects. The objects all have common properties such as first and last name, UID university ID number GPA, and then there are subclasses for graduate and undergraduate. I have been stumped as to how to sort the arraylist based on the UID number in order of lowest to highest. The UID number is a STRING in the format of U123456. There is always a U, and then a varied amount of integers. Because of the U, I cannot parse into an int and sort that way, I have seen the Comparator class being used, but I do not understand it, as it seems to only compare two objects IF the comparator class will work for this, could someone please explain to me what it does and how it works Thank you for your helpp

Negative 5832 pI am trying to write a program that will convert a number from ieee to TNS big endian, and vice versa.  Im very new to ARM and assembly in general.  Im not getting an error, its just not working as intended and Id appreciate it if anyone could look at it.  Every line is commented, the sub routine actually in question here is the unpack ieee procedure, it is not working as intended and I cannot see why. EDIT IEEE and TNS numbers have 3 parts, I am attempting to grab or seperate the 3 parts using the masks.  The unpack procedure is using the masks to place each part into a seperate register so that I can manipulate each part in order to convert it.  Currently I am trying to confirm that the unpack procedure works by calling it, and then printing the registers.  The numbers are either not printing or printing incorrect results.emend editem I have not written the conversion routines yet, but I have a psudocode algorithm I can post if youd like.  Just let me know if there is anything else youd like to know.

Negative 5832 pstrongThe backgroundstrongp  pIn trying to make the codebase CC for my app more portable, I would like to minimize my use of androids native AAssetManager and switch to libzip for loading assets from the APK. I had a look at libzip merged it into the project and  lo and behold  I can read my files directly from the APK using libzip.p  pNow, I would like to obfuscate my assets or at least make access to them nontrivial, so I thought Id package them into an encrypted zip archive and include that archive in the APK basically, a zip in a zip.p  pstrongMy questionstrongp  pemWhat would be the easiestmost effective way to access the files in the archive directly from within the APK using native codeemp  pI was hoping for a similar approach as with libzip, where I can simply specify a filename and then get a buffer with uncompressed data.p  pI have tried opening the compressed archive directly from within the APK using libzip, but Im coming up empty... it appears libzip will only open a zip file using a directory and not from a buffer in memory which is as far as I got.p  pI suppose zlib would be an obvious choice, but I admit I have no clue how to go about it.p  pI also thought about copying the archive out of the APK, but I would like to waste as little space as possible lots of assets  big archive. Delivery of the assets as a separate download is also something Id like to avoid.p  pHelpful suggestions or pointers are welcome.p

Negative 5832 pIm working on a shiftreduce parser generator in C11 and I am not sure how to specify the interface type of the input productions and reduction action functions such that they will hold the information I want to put in them.p  pI want to specify the grammar statically but using C types not a separate build tool.  p  pFor each symbol terminals and nonterminals the user provides a string name and a type.p  pThen each production specifies a head symbol name and one or more body symbol names.p  pFor each production an action function is provided by the user the hard part that returns the head nonterminal type and has parameters corresponding to the production body symbols of their corresponding types.p  pstrongThe main problem is statically binding the parameter types and return type of these action functions to the corresponding symbol typesstrongp  pSo for examplep  pSuppose we have nonterminals codeXcode, codeAcode codeBcode codeCcodep  pTheir namestypes might bep  precodeX Foo A string B string C int codepre  pAnd in the grammar there might be a productionp  precodeX gt A B C codepre  pAnd there will be an action function provided by the user for that productionp  precodeFoo fstring A, string B, int C codepre  pIf that production is reduced than the function f should be called with the production body parameters.  The value returned by f is then stored for when that symbol is used in a higher up reduction.p  pSo to specify the grammar to the parser generator I need to provide something likep  pI know the following is invalidp  precodestruct Symbol      string name     type T   struct Production      string head     vectorltstringgt body      functionlthead.Tbody[0].T, body[1].T, ..., body[n].Tgt action   struct Grammar      vectorltSymbolgt symbols      vectorltProductiongt productions  codepre  pAnd to specify the earlier example would bep  precodeGrammar example        symbols               X, Foo ,          A, string ,          B, string ,          C, int      ,       productions                            X,              A, B, C ,             []string A, string B, int C  ... return Foo...                 codepre  pThis wont work of course, you cant mix type parameters with runtime parameters like that.p  pOne solution would be to have some generic basep  precodestruct SymbolBase      ...   templateltclass SymbolTypegt struct SymbolDerivedltSymbolTypegt  SymbolBase      SymbolType value  codepre  pand then make all action functions of typep  precodetypedef functionltSymbolBasevectorltSymbolBasegtgt ActionFunction codepre  pand sort it out at runtime.  But this makes usage more difficult, and all the casting is slow.  Id rather have the function signatures checked at compiletime and keep the mechanics hidden from the user.p  pHow can I restructure the Symbol, Production and Grammar types to carry the information I am trying to convey in legal C11p  pYes I have looked at Boost Spirit and friends, it is a fine framework but it is recursive descent so the languages it can handle in a single pass are fewer than a LALR parser and because it uses backtracking the reduction actions will get called multiple times, etc, etcp

Negative 5832 pIve looked at the few topics here that I thought would answer this, but they dont seem to be exactly what Im looking for.p  pBasically, I have a database that, among other things, has a user table.  Due to those very same users, we often end up with duplicates.  In other words, one person has two separate accounts and uses both of them until we catch on and merge them into one account, tell them which it is and to stop trying to use the second account.  Unfortunately, the decision of which account to keep and which to axe isnt always something that follows a formula, but rather an admins knowledge of the situation and Im informed on a linebyline basis of which stays and goes.  p  pPart of the merge involves modifying several tables by replacing any occurrences of the discarded ID with the ID were keeping.  The last guy to have this job had a script to do this, but it simply assumed that the most recent login was the one to keep and pulled those pairs of IDs and made the mods.  I, however, cant rely on that being the case.  I have a spreadsheet with pairs of IDs that I would love to be able to run through and process.  Until now, Ive been doing this all by hand, one at a time.p  pSo, what Im looking for is something to the effect ofp  precodeforeach x,y in oldID1, newID1, oldID2, newID2, ...    go through tables and change all instances of x to y     codepre  pHopefully, that was clear enough.p  pThanksp

Negative 5832 pI have a multiprocess PHP CLI application that runs continuously. Originally, I was using the standard Ubuntu 10.04 package build of PHP 5.3.21ubuntu4.18. However, I am trying to optimize the memory usage because the amount of memory used by each process limits the number of forks that I can run at any given time since I have a finite amount of memory available. Following the advice given by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma14877107896660preinheimera, I recompiled PHP, disabling all extensions and then reenabling only those needed for my application mysql, curl, pcntl, posix, and json.

Is it possible that I am missing some php extension which somehow optimizes the script to use less computing resources Or is the Ubuntu build perhaps optimized for the Ubuntu architecture, whereas my custom build is lacking these optimizations If so, how can I figure out which optimizations are used in the Ubuntu build, in order to recreate them in my bare bones buildp  pHere is a snippet of the output from codeps aux  grep phpcode, which is used to demonstrate my point in the comments belowp  precoderoot  12952  0.3  0.9  33176  4968 pts2    S    Feb14  1115 s.php 5 root  12955  0.3  0.9  32664  4732 pts2    S    Feb14  1112 s.php 5 root  12958  0.3  0.9  32664  4796 pts2    S    Feb14  1051 s.php 5 root  12961  0.3  0.9  32740  4752 pts2    S    Feb14  1107 s.php 5 root  14162  0.3  0.9  33000  4904 pts2    S    Feb14  1051 s.php 5 root  14165  0.3  1.0  33256  5340 pts2    S    Feb14  1056 s.php 5 root  23426  9.5  1.1  13492  6040 pts2    S    Feb15 15138 s.php 1  codepre

But here are the strange thingsp  ol liWhen I remove just one a from the testBuffer, the conversion works, the testString is created properly. When I add one or more a, it doesnt work.li liWhen I damage the utf7 encoded symbol at the end the only one in this example, ADw, it works fine. I can change it to .ADw or ADw. and the buffer is converted properly. Of course, the damaged symbol is not decoded, its just written literally but the conversion works. It produces aaaaa.ADw in NSString. I can also cut the buffer by 1, so Ill have aaaaaADw and it will also be converted properly as the UTF7 symbol is incomplete.li liWhen I add any ASCII character at the end of the buffer, after the UTF7 symbol, it works. So I.e. aaaaaAdwa is converted into NSString aaaa.li liWhen the buffer contains more UTF7 symbols, the length when it starts failing changes. So its not always 508 or more characters.li liI can use any other UTF7 symbol at the end. It doesnt matter.li ol  pIve also tried to replace initWithBytes method with initWithCString. I didnt check all the possible cases, but in all tested ones it behaves the same like initWithBytes.

I have tried to set different auth headers with encoded loginpass but it doesncodet help and it doesncodet need because it should work without it, I thinkat least FF and iOS app work without this header.

Negative 5832 pHow can WPF resources  including styles, templates, etc.  be organized, so that I can use them across Windows, Pages or even Projects. What options do I have to achieve maximum reusability of my resources and a maintainable structure for example one file per Template p  pFor example I am creating a WPF application and I want to use a TabControl, but I want to make major changes to it. So I could create a style in  and apply it to the TabControl and TabItem. Thats ok, but where can I place my resources to keep my Window XAML clear and have the style accessible from other Windows or projects as wellp  pI found that I can add it to App.xaml but that is only a solution for one project and allows sharing just between items of this project. Also, I think it would be better to have these templates a little separate from other code, than placing it all in some page or app.xamlp

Negative 5832 pIve recently written my first Symfony2 app and all is well, except now I want to add in some query caching to improve performance and cut down on unneeded queries.

Negative 5832 pI have linked databases from MAS accounting system in SQL Server 2008 R2. The way payroll records work in this database is that each quarter, an archive of the payroll tables are made, and a new current quarter table is made with any terminated employees removed. It does have unique employee IDs. The structure is identical in the archive and current versions.p  pSo, in the 2nd quarter of the year, an employee who was terminated in the 1st quarter, is only in the 1st quarter copy of the database. An employee who worked in both the 1st and 2nd quarters is in the 1st quarter copy and the 2nd quarter copy. An employee who was hired in the 2nd quarter only occurs in the 2nd quarter.p  pI need to be able to build a set temp table, view, whatever to work with that includes the most recent record for each employee. This set will be the basis for queries like turnover, average wage by position, etc. p  pI can build a list of IDs quickly enough with a codeUNIONcode of the codeEmployeeIDcode column, but other columns change over time pay rate, address, etc, so I cannot simply codeUNIONcode all of the columns, as I will have duplicates for some employees.p  pIs there a reasonably efficient way to merge the historical databases together, keeping only the most recent row for each employee Having phrased the question that way, should I just make a series of codeMERGEcodes, stepping back through the archive copies from newest to oldest, inserting when not matched Is there a better wayp

The application also receives notifications from the bus and commits these changes to the local database.p  pThe problem is that when the application commits changes to the local database, the changes then show up in CDC causing the application to retransmit the changes on the bus.p  pIs there a reliable way to exclude specific changesets from CDCp  pI would like to avoid making changes to the source table schema if possible.p

Java does not really use IPv6 in the default configuration even if the OS uses IPv6.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase1.5.0docsguidenetipv6guideusinghttpdocs.oracle.comjavase1.5.0docsguidenetipv6guideusinga I set codejava.net.preferIPv6Addressescode to codetruecode to let it use IPv6. Result have been user bug reports about broken internet connection.p  pIt seems Java only switches to use IPv6 address instead of IPv4, but does nothing else. All CC based software I maintain has been changed to check and try all available IP addresses, so broken IPv6 or IPv4 addresses are skipped as long as one of the addresses works. For me it looks like Java only tries once, which does not work in real world.p  pAlso usually the OS prefers IPv4 over IPv6, when IPv6 is tunneled. It seems like Java does ignore this settings as well.p  pSo my question is Are there any good ways to get a Java application to use IPV6 by default when available without breaking the application for IPv4 users.p  pUserbug reports a hrefhttpjosm.openstreetmap.deticket8562httpjosm.openstreetmap.deticket8562a, a hrefhttpjosm.openstreetmap.deticket8627httpjosm.openstreetmap.deticket8627a.p

Heres how to force those files into a conflicted state so you can merge manually at your convenience.p      pIn TortoiseSVNSettingsSubversion configuration file, click on the edit button.   Change the [helpers] section by adding diffcmd  Cfalse.bat diff3cmd  Cfalse.bat note the double backslash       Create the file Cfalse.bat which contains two linesp blockquote  precode    type 9     exit 1 codepre  blockquote   pThis effectively makes automerge fail every time, forcing the file into conflict.p      pThe reason for the curious type 9 line is that the diff3cmd sends the merged output to stdout. Subversion then takes this and overwrites your local file with the merge results. Adding this line avoids getting an empty local file.p blockquote  pBut it doesnt seem to work because it is impossible to manually correct conflicts. The tortoisesvn tool used for editing conflicts, despite it enables editing these conflists, it doesnt write down the edited file correctly. The changes I make arent respected. The old file is completely overwriten with a new one.p  pThese files are created index2.php.mergeleft.r152, index2.php.mergeright.r157, index2.php.working and contain the oryginal content without additional changes like addtional strings like this one  that indicate what changes were made.p  pHow to correctly apply changes to the found conflicts  Or this solution is for the conflicts visualisation onlyp

Negative 5832 pAt first, Ill show the standard way to build a custom codeUpdateCommandcode for a codeDataAdaptercode used commonly when the Select has many tables involved and we cant use codeCommandBuildercode to build all the commands automatically for a codeDataAdaptercode.p  pHere is code for my DataAdapterp  precodeSqlDataAdapter myAdapter  new SqlDataAdapterSELECT ID, Name FROM MyTable, myConnection codepre  pHere is code for building a standard codeUpdateCommandcode for codemyAdaptercode. The example above involves only 1 single table, however, thats just for simple and demonstrative purpose.p  precodemyAdapter.UpdateCommand  new SqlCommandUPDATE MyTable SET IDid,Namename WHERE IDid2, myConnection myAdapter.UpdateCommand.Parameters.Addid, SqlDbType.VarChar.SourceColumn  ID myAdapter.UpdateCommand.Parameters.Addname, SqlDbType.VarChar.SourceColumn  Name myAdapter.UpdateCommand.Parameters.Addid2, SqlDbType.VarChar, 20, ID.SourceVersion  DataRowVersion.Original codepre  pThe problem is I dont want to bind the the codeParametercode to a codeSourceColumncode exactly. I want to change the value from codeSourceColumncode a little before the values are passed to the corresponding Parameter. For example, my ID column contains all the values like 1,2,3,4,... I would like to append some string e.g 000, 001, A, B, C, ... before it and pass this custom codeSourceColumncode to my Parameter. With the code above, the passed values are exactly what the codeSourceColumncode ID has 1,2,3,4... and what I want is for example C1,C2,C3,C4,...p  pThats is some kind of parsing value using some middle layer, I would like to know if this is possible. Parsing the value of codeSourceColumncode outside is OK however there is some case I have to parse it right when building the codeUpdateCommandcode for my Adapter. Here is a casep  pI have a codeDataGridViewcode which has a column of Gender, this column is of type codeDataGridViewComboBoxColumncode with 2 items Male and Female. The underlying datasource should have a corresponding Gender column and the values should be Male and Female, all the unmatched values not contained in the Items list of the codeComboBoxColumncode wont make the ComboBoxCell display the value correctly. Ive tried codeCellFormatingcode and codeCellPaintingcode but it didnt work. codeCellPaintingcode is too complex and codeCellFormatingcode didnt work at all. In fact, Im not using a standard .NET codeDataGridViewcode, Im using a custom codeDataGridViewcode also inherits from the standard codeDataGridViewcode. All Ive done to this codeDataGridViewcode didnt work. The only solution is to prepare all the underlying values to include only Male and Female. However I designed my codeGendercode column as a booleanbit column. Here is the SELECT commandp  precodeSqlDataAdapter myAdapter  new SqlDataAdapterSELECT ID, Name, CASE WHEN Gender  1 THEN Male ELSE Female END Gender FROM MyTable, myConnection codepre  pThe codeGendercode column now is type of varchar or text and not a booleanbit as I did before. But the codeGendercode column in the original table is type of bit. How can I build my codeUpdateCommandcode for the SELECT command above A solution is include a hidden codeGendercode column and use this column for the SourceColumn to build the UpdateCommand, the visible codeGendercode is just for displaying. This is however a little much more work to do. If I could do some kind of Custom codeSourceColumncode, it would be better to use.p  pYour help would be highly appreciatedp

Negative 5832 pI have been for a few days researching on a suitable auto or semiautomatic way of mass merging files this way. Basically, what I want to achieve is inserting the same clip, before a bunch of other clips.p  pIn this case Ive been trying with .flv, .mp4, .avi files always merging same codecs, and I didnt succeed after testing all the programs available in both Windows and OSx. Believe me, Ive tried them all. The only ones which are supposed to handle quite well this quite of tasks are from Videocharge emWatermark Masterem and emVideocharge Studioem. None of them could perform correctly the task. Maybe there was some way I could have achieved this by scripting with emAfter Effectsem or emSony Vegasem, I just didnt find any.p  pNow Im trying to find some way to achieve the same thing either by shell, unix scripting... I dont care. I just dont want to mount Ubuntu only for these tasks. Im not a programmer, but Im quite stuborn which sometimes leads me to neverending nights so I would appreciate some help or guidance from anyone keen and good enough on batch video processing or scripting.p  pRight now, the only useful paths Ive found drive me into either using strongmencodestrong or strongffmpegstrong through commands, but I am not able to perform the merge on batch. I dont care about the way to sort the videos out. But taking into consideration that the operation would be performed on hundreds or thousands of videos, it wouldnt be suitable to have them all in separate folders each accompanied by the unique intro clip. I guess that the most logic way would be storing the bunch videos in a folder, and the intro clip on the same folder as the encoder or renderer.p  pThanks in advance for any help or guidance,p

Negative 5832 pIm been trying to help an uncle of mine do some PHP and MYSQL Coding. His task is to take a P.O. Number, refer to a table that lists that P.O., and return to the browser specific columns of each row. Im not sure if that made sense. Basically what we are building is a web app where a user can enter a purchase order number, and itll run a script that will search a specific column in a table for that P.O. Now there are usually multiple rows that have the same P.O. so we need it to be able to send back all the different rows. Now to make it more fun we only need specific columns of those rows for data processing. We have an access database that does all this for us but we are looking at using MYSQL and PHP to see if its easier. Any help would be appreciative, just a point in the right direction would help Thanks guysp

Clicking on the New Window command there creates a new such window, which also behaves as expected.  Indeed, as long as you keep creating new top level windows, everything continues to work as expected.  However, once you delete close any one of those windows, then, in a subsequently created new window, the Choices cascade on the new menu is not functional.  It is still OK in the windows created before the closing of one.p  pThe situation in which I initially encountered this symptom was much more complex, but I was able to simplify it down to the above example which exhibits the issue. I have discovered that I can avoid the problem by having each instance of Top create its own checkmenu as an attribute but I do not understand why this should be necessary.  Please point me the way if there is one to avoid the problem without such replication of a cascade menu used in multiple windows.p

Negative 5832 pa hrefhttpipython.orgnotebook.html relnofollowIPython notebooksa hosted on github can be easily viewed with a hrefhttpnbviewer.ipython.org relnofollownbviewera. I have a number of notebooks that I would like to host there and expose to nbviewer but some of the notebooks import a python package I developed which can be installed via pip or easyinstall and use an external data file  10 MB.p  pIve read that if a notebook is hosted as a gist recommended and requires access external data files, the data files should sit in the same gist repo as the notebook. If I understand this correctly, I would need to rehost both the data file and the python package in the notebooks gist. That seems ok for a single gist but if there are multiple notebook gists using the same package amp data, then I would need to host them separately for each gist. Plus, if there is an update to the python package, I would need to update that code in multiple gist repos.p  pSo given this situation, is that the rightpreferred way to host the notebooks on github for use with nbviewer The other option I am considering is placing all the notebooks in a single emnormalem github repo where I would only need to place the datapackage once but that would lose the simplicity of having each notebook as a gist.p

Negative 5832 pI have a number of full screen CALayers as part of a single UIView. Depending on how the user interacts with the view, I need to show one layer and hide all others. Im currently doing this by changing the opacity, i.e. p  pLayer to hide [layer setOpacity0] Layer to show [layer setOpacity1]p  pFor a reason I dont quite understand, this seems to create a flashing effect on the screen. Partially to avoid this, but also because I have the impression that opacity changes can affect performances, Im wondering if changing opacity is actually the best way to hide andor show CALayers, e.g. should I consider changing the zPosition or changing its position so that it no longer appears on screen.p  pI dont want to animate the transition by the way.p  pThanks in advance for any pointers or help.p

So I stared deleting caches and setting the cache duration time down to 1 second.  Only occasionally did it behave as expected because the html seemed cached.  The only way I found to consistently get it to work as expected either when commenting in or out the line was to delete the cache and restart the browser firefox.  Then whenever I would put in the htmlscript again after restarting firefox, cake would work without the permission error.  Im sure the problem will come back, because I cant seem to find the root cause.p

I did a little research at google and came out with the following optionsp  ol lipGetting a virtual private server or dedicated machin out there in the cloud and implement a server that will replay the communication between the devices later on, a more sophisticated nat traversal technic can be used. The adventage A. Not tying myself to specific smartphones platform. B. The server can handle some of the logics. C. Implementation of more feathers such as statistics and advanced logging can be added. The disadvantages A. Developing another software  the server. B. paying a lot for the server hosting 80  500 per month. C. Taking care of server security and maintaining the server.pli lipUse the Apple game center. The advantage A. Simple and fast. Using gamekit B. free or low cost I couldnt find any reference for that The disadvantage A. I can use only the feathers that game center supplies. B. I wouldnt be able to make my game crossplatform.

Negative 5832 pIn previous versions of the SDK, specifying codealign  centercode to a coderallygridcode column config would result in both the column contents and column header being horizontally centered.

But I want to code defensively, and am trying to determine whether any C standard permits me to emrelyem on this behavior, or whether its undefined or implementationdefined.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma3751937272427This answera points out that the C99 standard does specify that passing a size of 0 to these functions shall be valid. Here is the text, from section 7.21.1p  blockquote   pWhere an argument declared as sizet n specifies the length of the array for a function, n can have the value zero on a call to that function. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the description of a particular function in this subclause, pointer arguments on such a call shall still have valid values, as described in 7.1.4. On such a call, a function that locates a character finds no occurrence, a function that compares two character sequences returns zero, and a function that copies characters copies zero characters.p blockquote  pReading section 7.1.4, on the other hand, seems to say that passing codeNULLcodes is not definedp  blockquote   pEach of the following statements applies unless explicitly stated otherwise in the detailed descriptions that follow If an argument to a function has an invalid value such as a value outside the domain of the function, or a pointer outside the address space of the program, or a null pointer, or a pointer to nonmodifiable storage when the corresponding parameter is not constqualified or a type after promotion not expected by a function with variable number of arguments, the behavior is undefined.p blockquote  pIs that your understanding too Can anyone confirmdeny whether the standard leaves this behavior undefinedp  pIm mainly targeting C99, but feedback about other C standards is also welcome.p

Negative 5832 pI have a function evaluation which is somewhat slow. Im trying to speed it up by using threading, since there are three things which can be done in parallel. The singlethreaded version isp  precodereturn dEdxshortE  dEdxlongE  dEdxquantumE codepre  pwhere evaluation of those functions takes 250us, 250us, and 100us respectively.

Negative 5832 pSo what Im trying to do with this program is take two arrays, and then merge them into a third array. The main method takes the data from a specified file and then creates arrays for each line, and there are only two lines.

I forgot that arrays arent called by their name and brackets, but merely the variable name. After realizing this, I figured out that I had to move the line that had the error into the Try block. Ive updated the code above to reflect these changes. p

Negative 5832 pIm really confused i spent alot of time searching for a solution and nothing satisfied me.p  pThe problem is that i have a masterpage with a form runatserver and a page with a masterpage called GestionUtilisateurs.p  pWhen i open the GestionUtilisateurs page all asp buttons events are not firing when i click on nothing happens, no exceptions ....  I tried to fix this so i deleted the form runatserver located in the masterpage and the buttons events returned working. The problem is that i cant remove the form from the masterpage because i have asp controls needs to be located in that form. And of course i cant add a specific form for the other page because itll be 2 runatserver forms in the same page when the page will execute...p  pThis is the GestionUtilisateur.aspx p  precode  lt

Negative 5832 pIm working on a booking application, and in the backend, the user will be able to specify which days of the week he wants his venue available on.

Negative 5832 pI have some template classes.

Negative 5832 pI am trying to broaden by OOP skills by trying to program a 2D graphical game. Using Javas swing utilities.p  pNow what I have so far is 4 general classes, an abstract class, an interface and a KeyListener class. Dont worry its a very small game at the moment.p  pOf the 4 general classes, the main class sets up two other classes as objects within it. These two objects are my graphics and my gamestate. Gamestate in turn sets up the last remaining object player within it.p  pThe problem I have is that when I initially got it all working so the player could move via keyPressed the way input is read from the keyboard meant the player would jerk forward slightly, then run in a continuous motion. This is exactly how if you hold down a letter key on your keyboard a single letter comes up before a string of letters begin to form.p  pSo I thought Oh its so obvious. I should try and tackle this with booleans so that when a key goes down I have boolean right  true. And Ill have some code somewhere going off in a loop with conditional statements for the moving of the player.p  pThis is where I am stuck. Because I cannot figure out how to do get into this loop without jamming up my program. In attempts I have run my program and been treated to nothing. The program hangs because its in the loop and hasnt brought up the swing window yet. I have a feeling the answer is thread related implements runnable, but I am in such new territory with this that I want a right and good way to do it.p  pSo I suppose this is a very open ended question to a variety of answers.

Negative 5832 pI am fairly new to Objective C and am attempting to develop an app using Xcode5.p  pI am storing strings either composed of numbers 19 or NA in a codeNSMutableDictionarycode.p  pWhen users get to the Review your inputed results page I want them to be able to manually go into a text field, delete the value present and retype their new value if necessary. However, I dont know how to reload this information into the system so that the new values will carry over into the email client, which basically sends the results to whatever email address the user wishes.p  pCurrently, the values are being loaded using codeViewDidAppearcode upon entering the codeUIViewcode, but I think I need to call it again if, for example, codetextField1code is updated.p  pI have methods for all the codetextFieldscode that are codetextFieldcodeinsert correct number hereIsUpdated and inside those I want to store the new value to the codeNSMutableDictionarycode which I believe I can already do. p  pThe issue is I cannot figure out how to get the current version of the dictionary that was loaded upon entering the codeUIViewcode to update so that the information in codeViewDidAppearcode updates for the email.p  pHope that made sense.

Negative 5832 pAlright, a short insight, I recently set up my new Lenovo y50 to dual boot Arch with Windows 8.1. I use Arch linux as my dev environment. I can launch Android Studio 5.6 and then it updates to 6.1. After the update this happened both on 6.0 and 6.1 it barely starts to load my project and the it kills my laptop.

Negative 5832 pFirst of all Im a total newbie in image processing, so please dont be too harsh on me. That being said, Im developing an application to analyse changes in blood flow in extremities using thermal images obtained by a camera. The user is able to define a region of interest by placing a shape circle,rectangle,etc. on the current image. The user should then be able to see how the average temperature changes from frame to frame inside the specified ROI.p  pThe problem is that some of the images are not steady, due to small movement by the test subject. My question is how can I determine the movement between the frames, so that I can relocate the ROI accordinglyp  pIm using the Emgu OpenCV .Net wrapper for image processing. What Ive tried so far is calculating the center of gravity using codeGetMomentscode on the biggest contour found and calculating the direction vector between this and the previous center of gravity. The ROI is then translated using this vector but the results are not that promising yet.p  pIs this the right way to do it or am I totally barking up the wrong treep  pEditp  pstrongHere are two sample images showing slight movement downwards to the rightstrongp  pa hrefhttppostimg.orgimagewznf2r27n relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimagewznf2r27nap  pstrongComparison between the contoursstrongp  pa hrefhttppostimg.orgimage4ldez2di1 relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimage4ldez2di1ap  pAs you can see the shape of the contour is pretty much the same, although there are some small differences near the toes.p  pIf necessary I can provide more details of course.p  pThank youp

In another words, I dont know how to put together the codethreadcode which I create to iterate the model, the codeWaitHandlecode and the codeQueryProcessCycleTimecode, even though I have read some a hrefhttpwww.yoda.arachsys.comcsharpthreadswaithandles.shtml relnofollowexamplesa of using codeWaitHandlecode I just cant mix everything together.p  ol liHow can I accomplish thatli ol  pIt would be something like thisp  precodeclass ModelSimulator      public Model1 model1  get private set   implements IModel     public Model2 model2  get private set   implements IModel   other methods       public void RunModelobject obj              IModel model  IModelobj         Int32 t  model.maxTime         while t gt 0             model.TimeStep       codepre  pAnd inside the codemaincode method, I dop  precode[DllImportKernel32, ExactSpelling  true, SetLastError  true] [return MarshalAsUnmanagedType.Bool] private static extern Boolean QueryProcessCycleTimeSafeWaitHandle processHandle, out UInt64 CycleTime  static void Mainstring[] args      ModelSimulator ms  new ModelSimulator     Thread thread  new Threadms.RunModel     thread.Startms.model1      here I start the thread, but how can I use QueryProcessCycleTime to measure      the thread execution  codepre  pPS mine is not a duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6526828howtogetthenumberofcpucyclesusedbyaprocessthis questiona, because I need some more specific answer, which is not there...

You may not wish to hardcode       things such as file lengths into your executable... and you may wish to       turn this code off during application development.           private static class XAPKFile          public final boolean mIsMain         public final int mFileVersion         public final long mFileSize          XAPKFileboolean isMain, int fileVersion, long fileSize              mIsMain  isMain             mFileVersion  fileVersion             mFileSize  fileSize                           Here is where you place the data that the validator will use to determine       if the file was delivered correctly. This is encoded in the source code       so the application can easily determine whether the file has been       properly delivered without having to talk to the server. If the       application is using LVL for licensing, it may make sense to eliminate       these checks and to just rely on the server.           private static final XAPKFile[] xAPKS               new XAPKFile                     true,  true signifies a main file                     4,  the version of the APK that the file was uploaded                         against                     240000L  the length of the file in bytes             ,             new XAPKFile                     true,  false signifies a patch file                     3,  the version of the APK that the patch file was uploaded                         against                     24000L  the length of the patch file in bytes                                           Go through each of the APK Expansion files defined in the structure above       and determine if the files are present and match the required size. Free       applications should definitely consider doing this, as this allows the       application to be launched for the first time without having a network       connection present. Paid applications that use LVL should probably do at       least one LVL check that requires the network to be present, so this is       not as necessary.              return true if they are present.           boolean expansionFilesDelivered          for XAPKFile xf  xAPKS              String fileName  Helpers.getExpansionAPKFileNamethis, xf.mIsMain, xf.mFileVersion             if Helpers.doesFileExistthis, fileName, xf.mFileSize, false                 return false                  return true                  Calculating a moving average for the validation speed so we dont get       jumpy calculations for time etc.           static private final float SMOOTHINGFACTOR  0.005f             Used by the async task           private boolean mCancelValidation             Go through each of the Expansion APK files and open each as a zip file.

Negative 5832 pemDisclaimer My DB knowledge comes mostly from Mysql so I might misunderstand some things in vertica...emp  pI would like to know if there exist a technique of insertingupdating values in vertica while enforcing unique constrains across multiple sessions. Lets assume I have a tablep  precodeid, uniquefield, somefiled codepre  pAnd there is a unique constraint on uniquefield. My understanding is that in vertica one first needs to do an insert and then do ANALYZECONSTRAINTS to verify if the constraint was violated. In my specific case, I have multiple sessions preforming INSERTS to the same table and they may try to push the same record. The sequence for a single session appears to bep  precodeInsert into table id, uniquefield, somefield values 5, abc, data SELECT ANALYZECONSTRAINTStable COMMIT codepre  pIf I run this sequence in two separate sessions, there is a chance that both queries try to insert the same uniquefield and for each of them there will be no constrain violation  detected as theyre in separate transactions, which will result in duplicate data.p  pIs there a better way to prevent this from happening  Or Im missing something. p

This is just getting the latest records before a specified time, where a different time may be provided for each account that is being queried thus the table valued parameter.

Negative 5832 pI realize that a hrefhttpsgithub.comjoyentnodeissues7543issuecomment41970902there are a ton of Node modules that provide an async API for parsing JSONa, but many of them seem to read the entire file or stream into memory, construct a giant string, and then pass it to codeJSON.parsecode. This is what a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma25710749396304the second answer to How to parse JSON using NodeJS suggestsa, and is exactly what the a hrefhttpsgithub.comjprichardsonnodejsonfileblobmasterlibjsonfile.jsjsonfile modulea does.p  pConstructing a giant string is exactly what I want to avoid. I want an API likep  pcodeparseJsonFilepathToJsonFile Promisecodep  pwhere the codePromisecode that is returned resolves to the parsed JSON object. This implementation should use a constant amount of memory. Im not interested in any sort of SAXlike thing that broadcasts events as various pieces are parsed just the end result.p  pI think a hrefhttpsgithub.comcreationixjsonparsejsonparsea may do what I want it clearly includes logic for parsing JSON without using codeJSON.parsecode, but there is no simple example in the codeREADME.mdcode, and the a hrefhttpsgithub.comcreationixjsonparseblobmasterexamplestwitterfeed.jsone file in the examples directorya seems overly complicated.p

Negative 5832 pIm working on Cordova application projectandroid. I have installed Cordova Push Notifications plugin to allow push notification for the application.

Negative 5832 pI have a simple two line bash script that copies a csv file list of users from a webapp to a remote server.p  precode binbash   homejamesbinUserList.py gtgt homejameslogsTMTUserExportLog amp date gtgt homejameslogsTMTUserExportLog  rsync homejamesdataTMTUsers.csv myserver.comdataTMTtest.csv gtgt homejameslogsTMTUserExportLog 2gtgt homejameslogsTMTerrlog codepre  pThe first just calls a python script that generate the csv file, stores it in homejamesdataTMTUsers.csv and outputs some data that I store in a log file. The second line rsyncs that file to the remote server ssh is set up to use passwordless authentication p  pNow here is the bizarre thing. When I run this script, either interactively from the command line, or as a cron job, the python script works fine and generates the correct file but rsync only transfers about 1015 of the file approx 100kb of an 800kb file and it seems to stop at a different point each time. There is no error output which as you can see I redirect to a log file. But when I run the exact same rsync command from the command line, it works perfectly the whole file is transferred. I tried using rcp instead of rsync and the same thing happens. p  pI am running Ubuntu 12.04 on the local server and 14.04 on the remote server.p  pAny thoughts p

Negative 5832 pIve been wondering about a way to include a random number of maps in a web page. Im currently working with GWT and embedding my javascript code into a JSNI function. I have an array of maps but due to my architecture, every map does know nothing about the others. My problem is that I have to include the gmaps script this way asynchronouslyp  precodevar script  doc.createElementscript script.type  textjavascript script.src  httpmaps.googleapis.commapsapijssensorfalseampinitializeMaps doc.body.appendChildscript codepre  pThe issue here is that I dont know the ids of the maps when loading the script, so I cannot load all of them within the initializeMaps function. p  pI would like to know whether it is possible to load each map separately instead of depending on the initializeMaps callback, where as I have said, I dont know the maps ids yet.p
Negative 5832 pLets say I have a simple piece of code like thisp  precodeifhardware.produceMeSomeData   somehowHandleFailure codepre  pNow I want to have my HW run on a separate computer which I want to communicate with remotely with CORBA. So the CORBA layer on both sides would look similar to thisp  precodeHardwareData HardwareClientproduceMeSomeData    IDLHardwareDatavar hwDataIdl   hardwareRefgtproduceMeSomeDatahwDataIdl.out    HardwareData hwData  nullptr    here Id like to do sth like this   ifCORBAisnilhwDataIdl     HardwareDataFromIdlhwDataIdl.in, hwData   return hwData   HardwareServantproduceMeSomeDataIDLHardwareDataout hwDataOut    HardwareData hwData  hardwaregtproduceMeSomeData   ifhwData     HardwareDataToIdlhwData, hwDataOut.ptr   else        codepre  pThe problem is, CORBA doesnt seem to allow returning nullpointers in any way. If I directly assign nullptr to the out type, the call will throw a BADPARAM exception as also stated in the docs, same if I dont assign anything to it. So it basically forces me to create an object and with that its kind of hard to design the logic I need here. Concretely Id have to abuse a valid object to represent a nullpointer just so I can differentiate both results on the client side. Another idea of mine would be to wrap the return type into a struct with a boolean that tells me whether the object is valid or not.p  pThe quick hack Im using right now is just to catch the BADPARAM exception on the client side and return nullptr in this case but this doesnt look like good and stable design either.p  pIs there a better and simpler solution for thisp

Negative 5832 pIve searched extensively for the answer to this question and could not find a good answer. Ive looked into several restore DB articles and a few rollbacks too but still no success.p  pMy situation is I have a very large database in which I did execute a wrong update query for a single column of a single table, and I have a full backup of this database until yesterday which is more than enough to correct the problem. But the other tables of this same DB were updated in the meantime, and I require them to keep their current values.p  pso after all the reading my plan was  Restore the full backup to a new location then get the values of the column I need and input those in the current database.p  pMy problem is Im not being able to restore this full backup without affecting the production DB. When I try to restore it, the sql studio says the mdf file cant be overwritten which is good because Ill be using the table further, then i saw some articles telling me to use the MOVE query. But if I do use it the mdf files from the originalproduction table will be relocated thus affecting the table right  I also saw a few articles telling me to roll it back if I have transaction logs backups. I wasnt actually able to tell if I do have those, nor what are those. even after googling it outp  pAny thoughts on how I should proceed p  psorry if it is a newbie question, but Im not originally a programmer yet I have been doing this for work and I really need it done fast  So any help would be strongly appreciatedp  pIm using SQL Server Standard 2005 with SQL Server Mangmt Studio 2008.p

The app is a simple todo listp  precodepublic class NewToDo extends Activity       private PendingIntent pendingIntent      private AlarmManager manager   ... codepre  pWhen the user creates a todo with a notification, I create it in one of the methods of this class like thisp  precode  int interval  30000   Intent alarmIntent  new Intentthis, AlarmReceiver.class   Lets let the putExtras apart, as documentation says theyre not considered when comparing intents, but I add some of them   manager  AlarmManager getSystemServiceContext.ALARMSERVICE   pendingIntent  PendingIntent.getBroadcastgetBaseContext, id, alarmIntent, alarmIntent.FILLINDATA   Printing id we see 3, for instance, but is a unique identifier to associate the notification with this todo item   I use the flag alarmIntent.FILLINDATA because I want to send extras to create a custom notification                     manager.setInexactRepeatingAlarmManager.RTCWAKEUP,                 System.currentTimeMillis  interval, interval,                 pendingIntent codepre  pI quit from the app but no difference if I dont quit.Then the notification arrives correctly each 30 seconds, and selecting it the app launchs on the detailed view of the item. An actionbar button allows editting it, calling again the same class, NewToDo.  While editting I can cancel the notifications associated with the todo, and  my code makes that like this in the NewToDo classp  precode  AlarmManager alarmManager  AlarmManager getSystemServiceALARMSERVICE   Intent i  new Intentthis, AlarmReceiver.class creating a matching Intent    Log.vgetStringR.string.appname, id   id  the 3 aforementioned    PendingIntent displayIntent  PendingIntent.getActivitygetBaseContext, id, i, alarmIntent.FILLINDATA   alarmManager.canceldisplayIntent codepre  pBut the notifications keeps appearing each 30 seconds, so theyre not cancelled.    p  pI saw the following suggestion in another postp  blockquote   pIntent intentYouWantToCancel  new Intentthis, AlarmReceive.class   intentYouWantToCancel.setActionaRelevantStringp      pwhen you set the alarmmanager as well as when you want to delete it.  p blockquote  pSo I put in both intents as aRelevantString a cast to String of the unique identifier.

Negative 5832 pI am in the early stages of framing stuff out on a new project.p  pI defined a function with a return type of boolp  pI got this output from PCLintp  precode    Including file sockets.h hdr bool sockcloseuint8t socketid  LINT sockets.h 52, 1 Note 970 Use of modifier or type Bool outside of a typedef [MISRA 2012 Directive 4.6, advisory] codepre  pI went ahead and defined this in another header to shut lint upp  precodetypedef bool boolt codepre  pThen I started wondering why I had to do that and why it changed anything. I turned to MISRA 2012 Dir 4.6. It is concerned mostly about the width of primitive types like short, int, and long, their width, and how they are signed.p  pThe standard does not give any amplification, rational, exception, or example for bool.p  pbool is explicitly defined as Bool in stdbool.h in C99. So does this criteria really apply boolp  pI thought Bool was explicitly always the smallest standard unsigned integer type large enough to store the values 0 and 1 according to section 6.2.5 of C99. So we know bool is unsigned. Is it then just a matter of the fact that Bool is not fixed width and subject being promoted somehow thats the issue Because the rational would seem to contradict that notion.p  blockquote   pAdherence to this guideline does not guarantee portability because the size of the int type may determine whether or not an expression is subject to integer promotion.p blockquote  pHow does just putting codetypedef bool booltcode change anything  because I do nothing to indicate the width or the signdedness in doing so The width of boolt will just be platform dependent too. Is there a better way to redefine boolp  blockquote   pA type must not be defined with a specific length unless the implemented type is actually of that lengthp blockquote  pso codetypedef bool bool8tcode should be totally illegal.p  pIs Gimpel wrong in their interpretation of Directive 4.6 or are they spot onp

Negative 5832 pDisclaimer Im a git newbie.p  pI followed the following post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma125278391022935Setting up your git repos the normal way here on stackoverflowa to get a bare repo set up at codehomewwwdatathemename.gitcode and a postreceive hook working that copied everything to my codevarwwwdomain.comhtdocswpcontentthemesthemenamecode folder. I followed the instructions on that post exactly. Everything was working perfectly. p  pHowever, today I wanted to take a look inside that codepostreceivecode hook and ran codecat  homewwwdatathemename.githookspostreceivecode. If you didnt notice, I accidentally placed two spaces after codecatcode instead of one. Which overwrote everything in the file rather than displaying it. Looking back, I should have just used codenanocode. So I opened the post again, and copied the code snipped from the post and pasted it into my codepostreceivecode hook again. But now it doesnt do anything. The files arent copied. p  pThinking that maybe it was a permissions issue, I ran codechown R wwwdatawwwdatacode on codevarwwwcode and that didnt work. I also ran codechown R wwwdatawwwdatacode on codehomewwwdatacode and that also didnt work. Lastly I ran codechmod x homewwwdatathemename.githookspostreceivecode to make the file executable in case it stopped being, and that also doesnt work. p  pAlso, codegit pullcode still works correctly in the codevarwwwdomain.comhtdocswpcontentthemesthemenamecode directory. p  pAny suggestions to fix this Or should I just create the repos and directories from scratch againp
