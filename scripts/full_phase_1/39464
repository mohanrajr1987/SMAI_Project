If I set it before that, then it uses only the one font I added. If I set it after i.e. codeeditor.on pluginsLoaded,...code  then its too late. The only solution I was able to find was to edit the font plugins codeplugin.jscode file to add my font into their list.p

Thus he clicks on the image and selects the upload button again, chooses another image and uploads it.

The phones internal camera is very good 4 megapixels but in j2me I only seem to be able to get a maximum of 1360x1020 image out.  I drew largely from this example a hrefhttpdevelopers.sun.commobilitymidparticlespicturehttpdevelopers.sun.commobilitymidparticlespictureap  pWhat I did was start with 640x480 and increase the width and height by 80 and 60, respectively until it failed.  The line of code isp  pjpg  mVideoControl.getSnapshotencodingjpegampquality100ampwidth  width  ampheight  heightp  pSo the two issues are  1.  The phone throws an exception when getting an image larger than 1360x1020.  2.  The higher resolution images appear to be just smoothed versions of the smaller ones. E.g. When I take a 640x480 image and increase it in photoshop I cant tell the difference between this and one thats supposedly 1360x1020.p  pIs this a limitation of j2me on the phone  If so does anyone know of a way to get a higher resolution from within a j2me application andor how to access the native camera from within another applicationp

Negative 39464 pIve been working on a Stored Procedure that checks the time, then retrieves records going back over the last full 24 hour period between 8am and the previous 8am.  So, for instance, assume that its currently 10am.  The stored procedure looks at the current time, notes that it is past 8am, and sets the query to run backwards 24 hours, from 8am today to 8a yesterday.  If it were, say, 7am, the query would be set to check from 8am yesterday to 8am the day before.  This was actually relatively simple to do.  The SP is meant to be used to retrieve records for a report tracking jobs completed in the given time span.p  pHowever, theyve come back at me and asked me to change the stored procedure such that the hour the report ends at, and the span of time checked, is configurable from the frontend of the site.

I know that setting the day range works properly in the ELSE portion of the toplevel if.  Im reasonably certain that the issue with setting the hour offset lies in how Im using the DATEADD and DATEDIFF function here, but I havent been able to figure out just where Im making my miss step.  Any help here would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 39464 pOccasionally Ill write a PHP function with a single input, an associative array containing all of that functions inputs. This has benefits such as not having to remember the correct order of inputs, but Ive also noticed it makes implementing changes to large codebases much easier when I need to add another variable, and that variable has to pass through 4 or 5 preexisting functions, its much easier when I can just stick it in the array and pass it along.p  pMy question is, is there a downside to doing thisp  pI rarely see functions written this way in examples, or in open source I use, which leads me to believe there is probably a downside. If there emisntem a reason not to do it then why not write all functions this wayp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThanks for all your answers. It looks like two major problems stand outp  pstrongCode readabilitystrong  impossible to tell what variables are going into a function and what theyre forp  pstrongVariable creepstrong  Could wind up with massive arrays bouncing from one function to the next one should not pass parameters to functions that dont require themp  pWhich are both great points I did not think about.p  pIt seems the general gist as well is that code where this is an issue, should probably be converted to a class. Unfortunately in this specific project such a refactoring is beyond the scope, but I also think Bill Karwins solution is good  pass an array of optional variablesp

Negative 39464 pHeres the situation  Ive got a class that is doing too much.  Its mainly for accessing configuration information, but it also has the database connection.  Its implemented as a singleton, so this also makes unit testing it difficult as most code is pretty tightly coupled to it.  This is even more problematic as it creates an importtime dependency were doing this in Python, which means that certain modules must be imported in a certain order.  Ideally, Id like to both split this into two classes and make it a nonsingleton.p  pFortunately, my employer has warmed up to the fact that this kind of testing is good and is willing to permit me to make changes like this if it makes code more testable.  However, I doubt that they will be willing to allow me to spend emtoo muchem time on it.  And Id rather fix this incrementally rather than trying to be too radical.p  pSo, I see three choices herep  ol liBreak the configuration object into a singleton configuration object and a nonsingleton database object.

Negative 39464 pMy original question from a while ago is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1587672msmqslowqueuereadingMSMQ Slow Queue Readinga, however I have advanced from that and now think I know the problem a bit more clearer.p  pMy code well actually part of an open source library I am using looks like thisp  precodequeue.ReceiveTimeSpan.FromSeconds10, MessageQueueTransactionType.Automatic codepre  pWhich is using the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.messaging.messagequeue.receive28VS.8029.aspxMessaging.MessageQueue.Receivea function and queue is a MessageQueue.  The problem is as follows.  p  pThe above line of code will be called with the specified timeout 10 seconds.  The codeReceive...code function is a blocking function, and is supposed to block until a message arrives in the queue at which time it will return.  If no message is received before the timeout is hit, it will return at the timeout.  If a message is in the queue when the function is called, it will return that message immediately.p  pHowever, what is happening is the codeReceive...code function is being called, seeing that there is no message in the queue, and hence waiting for a new message to come in.  When a new message comes in before the timeout, it isnt detecting this new message and continues waiting.  The timeout is eventually hit, at which point the code continues and calls codeReceive...code again, where it picks up the message and processes it.p  pNow, this problem only occurs after a number of daysweeks.  I can make it work normally again by deleting amp recreating the queue.  It happens on different computers, and different queues.  So it seems like something is building up, until some point when it breaks the triggeringnotification ability that the codeReceive...code function uses.p  pIve checked a lot of different things, and everything seems normal amp isnt different from a queue that is working normally.  There is plenty of disk space 13gig free and RAM about 350MB free out of 1GB from what I can tell.  I have checked registry entries which all appear the same as other queues, and the performance monitor doesnt show anything out of the normal.  I have also run the TMQ tool and cant see anything noticably wrong from that.    p  pI am using Windows XP on all the machines and they all have service pack 3 installed.  I am not sending a large amount of messages to the queues, at most it would be 1 every 2 seconds but generally a lot less frequent than that.  The messages are only small too and nowhere near the 4MB limit.p  pThe only thing I have just noticed is the p0000001.mq and r0000067.mq files in CWINDOWSsystem32msmqstorage are both 4,096KB however they are that size on other computers also which are not currently experiencing the problem.  The problem does not happen to every queue on the computer at once, as I can recreate 1 problem queue on the computer and the other queues still experience the problem.p  pI am not very experienced with MSMQ so if you post possible things to check can you please explain how to check them or where I can find more details on what you are talking about.p  pCurrently the situation isp  ul liComputerA  4 queues normalli liComputerB  2 queues experiencing problem, 1 queue normalli liComputerC  2 queues experiencing problemli liComputerD  1 queue normalli liComputerE  2 queues normalli ul  pSo I have a large number of computersqueues to compare and test against.p

The TabGroupPane does have a SelectedTab property, as well as each ContentPane having an IsActive property.  p  pSo the question is how do I set that information in my ViewModel  Making my VM a dependency object seems like a bad idea since I already implement INotifyPropertyChanged.  Using a CLR prop in my VM also doesnt work, since you cannot bind to it.p  pHow can I get my VM to know if it is the datacontext of an active tabp  pThanksp

At this point, all records past 3112010 were again missing except for one or two that were created right before the backup.p  pThis is just affecting one table in the database and it doesnt happen with every backup, just with the ones happening around 611 and 711.p  pAny ideas Im completely stymied about how to even diagnose this.

Negative 39464 pI have a problem with an Ajax app that Im trying to get working with the browsers Back and Forward buttons. I am using the jQuery History plugin to enable the browser history.p  pThe app consists of a page of products. There is a sort bar that enables the user to sort products by various values. The user may select a product clothing category dresses, tops, bottoms, skirts, etc, a subcategory department skirt mini, maxi, highwaisted, bohohippy, etc, a size XS S M L XL XXL XXXL, a color white, black, gray, blue, red, etc, and an era and materials. p  pMost options are enabled by using Ajax to load the latest selected option into the appropriate DIV. p  pSo for instance, to select the color Black, the following code would be executedp  precodecolorSort.loadcolorSort.phpcolorBlack codepre  pThen if the user selects Brownp  precodecolorSort.loadcolorSort.phpcolorBrown codepre  pThen if the user deselects Blackp  precodecolorSort.loadcolorSort.phpcolorRemoveBlack codepre  pThis works fine so long as we dont need to support the backforward buttons, but when add back button capability via jQuery History we run into problems. For example using our previous example, the user selected the colors black and brown. Now lets say the user clicks the back button. The user would expect their Brown color choice to be removed, but that isnt the case, because the URL being loaded is p  precodecolorSort.phpcolorBlack,  codepre  pand not p  precodecolorSort.phpcolorRemoveBrown  codepre  pwhich is what it needs to be.p  pI tried workingaround this problem by appending a set of undo params to the query string. So for instance, p  precodecolorSort.phpcolorBrowncolorRemoveBrown  codepre  pcontains the current query string before the double slashes and the back query string after the slashes. So using this code, if I knew a new link had been clicked, I could load the current query string before the slashes and if I knew the back button had been clicked, I could load the back query string following the slashes. p  pBut the problem is that there does not appear to be any way to detect whether the BackForward buttons were clicked. jQuery History operates under the hashchange event, and that event makes no distinction as far as I know as to what event fired it.p  pThis is my problem. I would be very grateful if the supersmart folks of StackOverflow.com could help me find a solution. Thank youp

Negative 39464 pLets take a simple example, a blog post.  I would store comments to a particular post within the same document.p  precodemessages   id  ObjectId4cc179886c0d49bf9424fc74,              title  Hello world,              comments  [  userid  ObjectId4cc179886c0d49bf9424fc74,                               comment  hello to you too,                              userid  ObjectId4cc1a1830a96c68cc67ef14d,                               comment  test,                             ]             codepre  pThe question is, would it make sense to store the username instead of the users objectid aka primary key  There are proscons to both, pro being that if I display the username within the comment, I wouldnt have to run a second query.  Con being if John Doe decides to modify his username, I would need to run a query across my entire collection to change his username within all commentsposts.p  pWhats more efficientp
Negative 39464 pIm building a server that serves two clients using streamreaderswriters using networkstreams, using newline symbols to indicate the startend of a new command.  Because readline and writeline too, but thats not an issue, will block until there actually is a line to read, I use socket.select in order to determine when there is a line to read.  However, because I dont know how many lines there are to read, I just read one, and loop back using socket.select again.  Which, according to the documentation a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.net.sockets.socket.select.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.net.sockets.socket.select.aspxa says that if its still readable, it will make the list to the readable sockets and continue, or if youve read everything, it wont.  Here is my codep  precodeDateTime startTime  DateTime.Now DateTime endTime  startTime.AddSecondsDouble.ParseplayTime ListltSocketgt clients double secondsLeft while secondsLeft  endTime  DateTime.Now.TotalSeconds gt 0      clientSockets  new ListltSocketgt  clientSocket1, clientSocket2      Socket.SelectclientSockets, null, null, intsecondsLeft  1000000     if clientSockets.ContainsclientSocket1              handlePlayerreader1, writer1, writer2          if clientSockets.ContainsclientSocket2              handlePlayerreader2, writer2, writer1       codepre  pHowever, in a unit test, when the clients send a lot of words in rapid succession, it will only read the first word from each player and then scoekts.select will freeze until the timout is reached.  So is this the right way to see if theres more data in the network stream As a streamreader.p

Negative 39464 pIve got some code that needs to scan through a hierarchical database schema, looking for properties defined in the schema that have certain interesting properties. I want to make a flat list of the names of these properties. p  pTo hopefully reduce confusion, Ill call the classes that are defined in the schema Kinds, because the schema does not describe a C class hierarchy.p  pThe schema is available to me as a tree of .NET objects I dont need to parse any XML or anything.

Negative 39464 pIn MSVS when I include ltsomeHeadergt it is searched in a different folder than the headers included with include someheader.

The help message from this options says that it will solve my problem, but...p  blockquote   pIf enabled, both include   ltheader.hgtstyle and include   header.hstyle directives will   search the paths in User Header   Search Paths before Header Search   Paths, with the consequence that user   headers such as your own String.h   header would have precedence over   system headers when using include   ltheader.hgt.

And codemcode is a parameter that ranges from code1.1code to codeinfinitycode and codeccode is the number of clusters. The distance used is the euclidean norm.p  pIf I had to implement this formula in a banal way Id dop  precode    forint i  0 i lt X.length i              int count  0         forint j  0 j lt V.length j                          double num  D[i][j]                 double sumTerms  0                 forint k  0 k lt V.length k                                       double thisDistance  D[i][k]                      sumTerms  Math.pownum  thisDistance, 1.0  m  1.0                                  U[i][j]  float 1f  sumTerms                 codepre  pIn this way some optimization is already done, I precomputed all the possible squared distances between codeXcode and codeVcode and stored them in a matrix codeDcode but that is not enough, since Im cycling througn the elements of codeVcode two times resulting in two nested loops. Looking at the formula the numerator of the fraction is independent of the sum so I can compute numerator and denominator independently and the denominator can be computed just once for each pixel. So I came to a solution like thisp  precode    int nClusters  V.length     double exp  1.0  m  1.0     forint i  0 i lt X.length i              int count  0         forint j  0 j lt nClusters j                       double distance  D[i][j]              double denominator  D[i][nClusters]              double numerator  Math.powdistance, exp              U[i][j]  float 1f  numerator  denominator                codepre  pWhere I precomputed the denominator into an additional column of the matrix codeDcode while I was computing the distancesp  precode    for int i  0 i lt X.length i              for int j  0 j lt V.length j                      double sum  0             for int k  0 k lt nDims k                              final double d  X[i][k]  V[j][k]                 sum  d  d                           D[i][j]  sum             D[i][B.length]  Math.pow1  D[i][j], exp               codepre  pBy doing so I encounter numerical differences between the banal computation and the second one that leads to different numerical value in codeUcode not in the first iterates but soon enough. I guess that the problem is that exponentiate very small numbers to high values the elements of codeUcode can range from 0.0 to 1.0 and codeexpcode , for codem  1.1code, is code10code leads to very small values, whereas by dividing the numerator and the denominator and strongTHENstrong exponentiating the result seems to be better numerically.

Negative 39464 pLittle by little i begin to understand the power of Rspec, though i still do not see why i would need to use it to test controllers or views im sure there are reasons behind it.p  pIm creating a browser game where users attack monsters. In my head, Rspec would be really really useful if it could provide a bruteforcing mechanism for me. For instance, lets say that i want to have a certain user fight all the monsters one by one and provide some conditions that will trigger the tests to fail.p  pFor example, if a user fights a monster of the same level, hp, and about the same strength, it would be really weird if heshe is killed while the monster still has more than 70 of its hp thats just a scenario.p  pIt seems to me that this kind of behaviour is tested with rspec in combination with cucumber  I would really like to get some insight on that topic.p

Negative 39464 pDear all. I was exploring matplotlibs 3d plot capabilities yesterday and was pleasantly surprised, it looks good. Just to be clear, withp  precodefrom mpltoolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D codepre  pHowever, when I try to continuously redraw the plot with draw, I get the error that draw for 3d plots takes an additional argument aside from self. This argument is called renderer, and is not optional. Looking through the code for 3d axes, I couldnt find a specification of what I should put as renderer.p  pDo you have any idea how I should work around this problem Just to be clear, I can use draw with normal plots turning ion on etc., so my issue is only with Axes3D.p  pBasically, I want to mimick some code I already wrote in matlab, which draws a 3d plot and then updates it with drawnow.p  pEDIT I realized that the renderer argument might be computer specific. I am sitting on a Windows with the Enthought installation of Python. If you need more information, let me know.p

Interestingly what I did was create a Shared Pref to store the state of the service as running or stopped and toggle it from onCreate and onDestroy. Now before I call startService I check the state of the shared pref and if an instance of the service is still running I call stopService first and then startService. I am still testing it but after coding this workaround the problem hasnt occurred yetstrongp

In order to accomplish this, a user recommended I use the codeselectcode command to wait for this input.p  pHowever, I have run into some difficulty with this approach.  Initially, codeselectcode would return the value indicated a timeout on the response every time even though the modem was sending back the correct responses, which I verified with another program running at the same time.

Negative 39464 pSuppose we have a stage with two squares, like so img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwVifT.png altOur example Flash stagep  pSuppose wed like the yellow square to be initially hidden, and wed like that as long as the mouse cursor is inside the bounds of the red square  the yellow square will be visible, and as long as the mouse cursor is out of the bounds of the red square  that the yellow square will be hidden.p  pThe intuitive approach is to write something like thisp  precodeinSqr.visible  false outSqr.addEventListener MouseEvent.ROLLOVER,sqrOver outSqr.addEventListener MouseEvent.ROLLOUT,sqrOut  function sqrOvereMouseEvent      inSqr.visible  true   function sqrOut eMouseEvent      inSqr.visible  false  codepre  pWith this code, however  any time you move the mouse cursor to within the strongyellow squarestrong   it, apparently, counts as a strongROLLOUTstrong for the strongREDstrong square   thus the sqrOut function is triggered  making the yellow square disappear, and once the yellow square is not there  the cursor is suddenly within the bounds of the strongREDstrong square again  so the sqrOver function gets called  bringing back the yellow squares visibility  triggering sqrOut and so on and so forth, thus creating a flickering yellow square when the mousecursr is over him the yellow square disappears and reappears repeatedly over and over again.p  pA possible fix for this is to remove the listener for the reds rollout event while the cursor is inside the yellow if its inside the yellow it surely is inside the red as well, and bring it back when it is out, by adding this to the code abovep  precode inSqr.addEventListener MouseEvent.ROLLOVER,insqrOver  inSqr.addEventListener MouseEvent.ROLLOUT,insqrOut  function insqrOvereMouseEvent       if outSqr.hasEventListener MouseEvent.ROLLOUT           outSqr.removeEventListenerMouseEvent.ROLLOUT,sqrOut            inSqr.visible  true    function insqrOuteMouseEvent       if outSqr.hasEventListener MouseEvent.ROLLOUT           outSqr.addEventListenerMouseEvent.ROLLOUT,sqrOut         codepre  pThis works. But it is cumbersome. You have to do it for each any object inside the bounds of the red square  resulting in long code and many event listeners and continuous listenerregistration and unregisteration.p  pbr A few years ago someone suggested to me this techniquep  precode outSqr.addEventListener Event.ENTERFRAME,hoverCheck   function hoverCheck eEvent       if e.currentTarget.hitTestPointstage.mouseX,stage.mouseY,true           inSqr.visible  true            else           inSqr.visible  false         codepre  pThis is a simple short code that works. But, if your project doesnt really need to use the ENTERFRAME event it creates the unnecessary overhead and cpucycles of repeatedly running the hit test. Also, if the red square covers the entire stage has the same dimensions as the stage   it creates problems strongit doesnt workstrong.p  pbrp  pIs anyone aware of a simple elegant way to accomplish this  one that would not involve  too cumbersome and long code and that would not have to use a repeated timer that hittests over and over again...p

Negative 39464 pAlright, this is melting my brain. It might have something to do with the fact that I dont understand Upstart as well as I should. Sorry in advance for the long question.p  pIm trying to use Upstart to manage a Rails apps Unicorn master process. Here is my current codeetcinitapp.confcodep  precodedescription app  start on runlevel [2] stop on runlevel [016]  console owner   expect daemon  script   APPROOThomedeployapp   PATHhomedeploy.rbenvshimshomedeploy.rbenvbinPATH   APPROOTbinunicorn c APPROOTconfigunicorn.rb E production  gtgt tmpupstart.log 2gtamp1 end script   respawn codepre  pThat works just fine  the Unicorns start up great. Whats not great is that the PID detected is not of the Unicorn master, its of an codeshcode process. That in and of itself isnt so bad, either  if I wasnt using the automagical Unicorn zerodowntime deployment strategy. Because shortly after I send codeUSR2code to my Unicorn master, a new master spawns up, and the old one dies...and so does the codeshcode process. So Upstart thinks my job has died, and I can no longer restart it with coderestartcode or stop it with codestopcode if I want.p  pIve played around with the config file, trying to add D to the Unicorn line like this codeAPPROOTbinunicorn c APPROOTconfigunicorn.rb E production Dcode to daemonize Unicorn, and I added the codeexpect daemoncode line, but that didnt work either. Ive tried codeexpect forkcode as well. Various combinations of all of those things can cause codestartcode and codestopcode to hang, and then Upstart gets really confused about the state of the job. Then I have to restart the machine to fix it.p  pI think Upstart is having problems detecting whenif Unicorn is forking because Im using rbenv  the coderubylocalexeccode shebang in my codeAPPROOTbinunicorncode script. Here it isp  precodeusrbinenv rubylocalexec   This file was generated by Bundler.   The application unicorn is installed as part of a gem, and  this file is here to facilitate running it.   require pathname ENV[BUNDLEGEMFILE]  File.expandpath....Gemfile,   Pathname.newFILE.realpath  require rubygems require bundlersetup  load Gem.binpathunicorn, unicorn codepre  pAdditionally, the coderubylocalexeccode script looks like thisp  precodeusrbinenv bash   rubylocalexec is a dropin replacement for the standard Ruby  shebang line      usrbinenv rubylocalexec   Use it for scripts inside a project with an .rbenvversion  file. When you run the scripts, theyll use the projectspecified  Ruby version, regardless of what directory theyre run from. Useful  for e.g. running project tasks in cron scripts without needing to  cd into the project first.  set e export RBENVDIR1 exec ruby  codepre  pSo theres an codeexeccode in there that Im worried about. It fires up a Ruby process, which fires up Unicorn, which may or may not daemonize itself, which all happens from an codeshcode process in the first place...which makes me seriously doubt the ability of Upstart to track all of this nonsense.p  pIs what Im trying to do even possible From what I understand, the codeexpectcode stanza in Upstart can only be told via codedaemoncode or codeforkcode to expect a maximum of two forks.p
Negative 39464 pI am tying to make a cross domain http request to WCF service that I own. I have read several techniques for working around the cross domain scripting limitations. Because my service must accommodate both GET and POST requests I cannot implement some dynamic script tag whose src is the url of a GET request. Since I am free to make changes at the server I have begun to try to implement a workaround that involves configuring the server responses to include the, AccessControlAllowOrigin header and preflight requests with and OPTIONS request.

Negative 39464 pI have an osCommerceshop where I need to access a variable from inside an included phpfile. For the sake of simplicity here is a short example of what I am talking about without anything related to osCommercep  pThe file inside.php shows a picture and is only displayed on the homepage by being somehow required in index.php. Depending on what language has been selected it should show either picture 1 or 2. Currently only the first picture is displayed because I have no way of knowing which one should be used. Normally there is a languageid variable which I can check if it is either 1 english or 2 german. Unfortunately languageid in inside.php is empty or at least it looks like it so I need a way to access the variable from index.php. Is there a way to do this without passing this variable or something like that Since it is a osCommerceshop I am not sure how I could to thatp  pI hope what I tried to explain is somewhat understandable, if not, please ask and Ill try to clarify.p

Negative 39464 pI have an ASP.NET MVC 3 application running in Azure. p  pIn one part of my application I want the user to be able to Create,Edit,Delete Documents Word, Excel in browser. p  pEDITp  pIve looking a three options right now, all with road blocking issues. p  p1 Open XML looked very appealing at first, since it does Almost everything I need and plays well with Azure. However, the one thing it doesnt do is allow a User to actually edit the doc in browser.p  p2 Using a WYSIWYG editor such as CKEditor or TinyMCE, since they allow the User to edit a doc in real time However not excel. The issue is I cant find a way to convert between Word and WYSIWYG formats HTML.p  pI was trying to find something in OpenXML that would convert the two formats. Essentially merging 1 and 2 together.p  p3 Lastly, which seems like the easiest and most comprehensive, is to integrate Office365 into the App. All I would need is for Office Web Apps Word,Excel to save files to Blob storage. Also if a User clicked on a file, it would open up Office and allow the user to edit and again save the file. There are a few issues Ive ran into with this tho. The only way Ive seen the functionality I want work is to use SharePoint Online, which is not an option for me. Also Im a little worried about salablityp  pIm leaning way more towards 3 since it seems like it would be the fastest and most graceful solution.p  pHave you come across a good way of directing Office Web Apps to store and edit files on Azure without involving SharePoint   p

Negative 39464 pIn a bash script I would like to parse the names of all subdirectories and find all subdirectories that have a matching string, but I do not want subdirectories of a match. I am interested in automating construction of my PATH and PYTHONPATH variables based on directory structure.p  pHeres an example Lets say I want to go through my dev and bin folders and find all subdirectories with bin which holds programs that I will want to run at the shell. I can get a list with p  precode ls lR HOMEbin HOMEdev grep    grep bin Usersdat5hbin Usersdat5hbinprojectbin ... codepre  pThese can all be appended to codePATHcode and have all available scripts ready to run. p  pBUT, lets say I was searching for directories with python modules and packages to add to codePYTHONPATHcode. I could conceivably look for all directories that start with codepycode. So, I tryp  precode ls lR HOMEbin HOMEdev grep    grep py  Usersdat5hbinpytest Usersdat5hbinpytesttestpackage Usersdat5hbinpytesttestpackagenestedtest ... codepre  pMy thinking is that I would not want to put package directories and subdirectories into the path. Im pretty sure that would be strange, but I am actually new to python so suggestions would be helpful. How would I go about constructing a test case to only get directories with py but non of the subsequent subdirectoriesp  pI triedp  precode ls lR HOMEbin HOMEdev grep    egrep py.[] codepre  pBut this doesnt get the job done either. Maybe a better regex Any help would be greatly appreciatedp  hr  pstrongSOLUTIONstrongp  pThe solution I ended up satisfied with was the find suggested below with a cutoms regexp  pcodefind HOMEbin HOMEdev type d  regex .pywwcodep  pThis will find all subdirectories of bin and dev that are some variant of pySOMETHING, pySOMETHING, pySOMETHINGELSE, or pySOMETHINGELSE but does not grab any subdirectories of those unless they also match this string. This ensures that I can have some simple naming convention for all of my directories with python modulespackages and import them this way without accidentally being able to import nested packages without the hierarchy.p
Negative 39464 pI have a python django web application. It uses an external web service Facebook Graph.

Negative 39464 pI am trying to use python to help do some automation around an incremental build function in the Android build system.  Generally, from a given directory, I would execute the following command to build whatever is in that directory and subdirectoriesp  precodemm j8 codepre  pThis is analogous to a make command, only it is incremental build and is defined as a function in a bash file called envsetup.sh.

To execute this, I can also dop  precodebash c . pathtoenvsetup.sh mm j8 codepre  pThis method of calling it will be important in calling the function from python.  I have followed the solution a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5826523343381herea which shows how to call a function within a bash script from python.  I have used this method in a simple script that, in theory, should just spit out the STDOUT and STDERR from executing the commandp  precodeimport subprocess  command  [bash, c, . pathtoenvsetup.sh mm j8] stdout, stderr  subprocess.Popencommand, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, stderrsubprocess.PIPE, shellTrue.communicate  print stdout   stdout print stderr   stderr codepre  pThe call to codePopencode, however, never returns.  What am I doing wrong that would allow bash to execute the command properly, but Python hangs when executing the commandp

Negative 39464 pIn our app under development we are using Core Data with a sqlite backing store to store our data. The object model for our app is complex. Also, the total amount of data served by our app is too large to fit into an iOS iPhoneiPadiPod Touch app bundle. Because of the fact that our users are, typically, interested only in a subset of the data, weve partitioned our data in such a way that the app ships with a subset albeit, 100 MB of the data objects in the app bundle. Our users have the option of downloading additional data objects of size 5 MB to 100 MB from our server after they pay for the additional contents through iTunes inapp purchases.  The incremental data files existing in sqlite backing stores use the same xcdatamodel version as the data that ships with the bundle there is zero changes to the object model. The incremental data files are downloaded from our server as a gzipped sqlite files. We dont want to bloat our app bundle by shipping the incremental contents with the app. Also, we dont want to rely on queries over webservice because of the complex data model.  Weve tested the download of the incremental sqlite data from our server. We have been able to add the downloaded data store to the apps shared persistentStoreCoordinator. p  precode  NSError error  nil  NSDictionary options  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys  [NSNumber numberWithBoolYES], NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption,   [NSNumber numberWithBoolYES], NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption, nil]   if [persistentStoreCoordinator addPersistentStoreWithTypeNSSQLiteStoreType configurationnil URLdefaultStoreURL optionsoptions erroramperror]     NSLogFailed with error , [error localizedDescription]  abort      Check for the existence of incrementalStore   Add incrementalStore  if incrementalStoreExists   if [persistentStoreCoordinator addPersistentStoreWithTypeNSSQLiteStoreType configurationnil URLincrementalStoreURL optionsoptions erroramperror]     NSLogAdd of incrementalStore failed with error , [error localizedDescription]  abort        codepre  p However, there are two problems with doing it this way.p  ol liData fetch results e.g., with NSFetchResultController show up with the data from the incrementalStoreURL appended to the end of the data from the defaultStoreURL.li liSome of the objects are duplicated. There are many entities with readonly data in our data model these get duplicated when we add the second persistentStore to the persistentStoreCoordinator.li ol  pIdeally, we would like Core Data to merge the object graphs from the two persistent stores into one there are no shared relationships between data from the two stores at the time of the data download. Also, we would like to remove the duplicate objects. Searching the web, we saw a couple of questions by people attempting to do the same thing we are doingsuch as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9403319saveobjectsfrommultiplestorestosinglepersistentstorethis answera and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3741668combiningtwosqlitestoresintoonethis answera. Weve read a hrefhttpwww.cimgf.com20110822importinganddisplayinglargedatasetsincoredataMarcus Zarras blog on importing large data sets in Core Dataa. However, none of the solutions weve seen worked for us. We dont want to manually read and save the data from the incremental store to the default store as we think this will be very slow and error prone on the phone. Is there a more efficient way of doing the mergep  pWeve attempted to solve the problem by implementing a manual migration as follows. However, we havent been able to successfully get the merge to happen. We are not really clear on the solution suggested by answers 1 and 2 referenced above. Marcus Zarras blog addressed some of the issues we had at the outset of our project importing our large dataset into iOS.p  precode NSError error  nil  NSDictionary options  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys  [NSNumber numberWithBoolYES], NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption,   [NSNumber numberWithBoolYES], NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption, nil]    NSMigrationManager migrator  [[NSMigrationManager alloc] initWithSourceModelmanagedObjectModel destinationModelmanagedObjectModel]  if [migrator migrateStoreFromURLstateStoreURL  typeNSSQLiteStoreType   optionsoptions   withMappingModelnil  toDestinationURLdestinationStoreURL   destinationTypeNSSQLiteStoreType   destinationOptionsnil   erroramperror]    NSLog, [error userInfo]  abort    codepre  p It seems that the author of answer 1 ended up reading his data from the incremental store and saving to the default store. Perhaps, weve misunderstood the solution suggested by both articles 1 amp 2. The size of our data may preclude us from manually reading and reinserting our incremental data into the default store. My question is what is the most efficient way to get the object graphs from two persistentStores that have the same objectModel to merge into one persistentStore p  pAutomatic migration works pretty well when we add new entity attributes to object graphs or modify relationships. Is there a simple solution to merging similar data into the same persistent store that will be resilient enough to stop and resumeas automatic migration is done p

Because I need to store this on the server ASP.NET and because I want to resume the count when they reload the page, I get two variables from the server.

All statements of cause PreparedStatements Im using during the import are initialized only one time and reused for every set to import. p  pNow Im  facing following problem The first call of an procedure of the package takes over 90 of the time for one set. I have to call about 10 procedures during the import and the first one takes about 4 seconds the rest about 0.4 seconds. It doesnt matter if its the 10th or 100,000th set to import the first procedure call allways takes that time.p  pImportant to know is, if Im calling another procedure on first position this on takes the 90. So, may be Im wrong, it is something about the package initialization But if Im reusing prepared statements, shouldnt that happen only at first callp  pThe PLSQL package has about 10,000 lines of code and also calls several other packages during the import.p  pSo now my questions arep  pWhat are possible reasons for this problem And what are potential solutions Are there any tools I can use to identify the causerp  pstrongEDITstrong I could identify the cause of the slow import.

Negative 39464 pIf I understand correctly, with set you can create class variables on the fly, which will be public, as well as access privateprotected properties.p  pIt seems like usingp  precodesetname,value    thisgtdata[name]  value  codepre  pORp  precodesetname,value    thisgtname  value  codepre  p... would both result in all kinds of garbage in and out.p  pWith individual setters mutators, 1 for each protectedprivate property, you have individual validation control, but you have to write a bunch of setters.p  pIs there some way to take advantage of magic set and still validate depending on the property.p  pE.g. lets sayp  precodeclass stuff     private name  alphabet, limit 10 chars   private size  integers 1  10   private price  decimals 0.000  999.999    setproperty,value      thisgtproperty  value       thing  new stuff thinggtname  1234 thinggtsize  b thinggtprice  40 codepre  pHow would you validate the bad assignmentsp
Negative 39464 pI am trying to get a set of nine .c files and nine related .h files to compile under Windows.p  pThe code was originally designed in Linux to take command line arguments using the standard GNULinuxC library getopt.h.

For those of you familiar with this Clibrary getopt.h will it be possible to build and run my code in Windows if it depends on POSIXstyle commandline arguments  Or will I have to rewrite the code to work for Windows, passing input files differently and ditching the getopt.h dependencyp

Negative 39464 pWell, im designing a small affiliate system using PHP and Neo4J in order to teach myself a little more about Neo4J and how graph databases work. My original affiliate system was in MySQL and the performance gain by just migrating the design and storage to Neo4J is absurd.p  pHowever, there are some features that im probably doing VERY wrongly and im willing to see how better it could be, with some help from more experienced developers. For example, each month the system has to calculate the amount of dollars to pay to each affiliate. This follows some rules that force me to search through an entire user network. p  pFor example, in order to calculate Joes monthly pay, the system has to p  precodeFind Node Joe function Calculate   Calculate amount of people referred all tiers   Calculate the number of referral tiers all tiers   Calculate points   Store information inside object properties codepre  ul litiers Joe refers Mary who in its turn refers Bob. Mary is Tier 1, Bob is Tier 2, under Joe.li liall tiers calculate number based on Joe, Mary and Bobli ul  pSo, the Calculate function looks like a recursive function. Foreach user referred by Joe, i have to run the Calculate function on him, and any of his children, until i get back to Joe and get my numbers. p  pThis is slow as hell. I thought about using RabbitMQ or ZMQ and creating a queue for each children process of Joes calculation. I also thought about using pcntls forking. How can i make this recursive process inside my graph network better Whats the best way to go through the entire tree Queuing Process Forkingp  pAnother examplep  precodeCalculateJoe   Joe referred Mary, Bob, Peter   CalculateMary   Mary referred Sara, Megan     CalculateSara     CalculateMegan   CalculateBob   Bob referred Billy, Michael     CalculateBilly     CalculateMichael   CalculatePeter   Peter referred Charles, Max     CalculateCharles     CalculateMax codepre  pNow, multiplicate this for someone with 500 referrals, and each of his referrals can have more 500 people. Its slow as hell and i have to show this on Joes Dashboard, each month. p

Negative 39464 pI created some data classes inside of my WCF service to transport data back and forth between the service and the client. As such, these objects are decorated with [ServiceContract] and [DataMember] thus exposed to the client so that I can instantiate one, fill it in and send it off to the service. Now, I noticed that I can use polymorphism within the service, but Im not having so much luck doing it between the client and the service. For instancep  pIn the service, there is a class called Ticket and a class called MOCTicket that derives from Ticket. There is also a method that accepts Ticket as an argument. Normally, I should be able to send that method an MOCTicket object and itll work fine since it derives from Ticket, and I can do this within the service. However, if I instantiate an MOCTicket object on the CLIENT side and try to send it to the service method that accepts Ticket, it throws errors. Im guessing this is a serialization issue. p  pIm just kind of confused about sort of behaviors I can get out these data classes. You get some but not others. Like I cant serialize behaviorsmethods or constructors, but I can serialize a lazy loaded property or so it would seem. At any rate, if someone could  help me out with achieving what I described above or if its possible. Any additional clarification about these objects would be appreciated as well. Ive googled around trying to find answers, but couldnt find anything written clear enough to answer this. Thanks.p

Negative 39464 pIm in the process of designing the base architecture of a web application. The project follows the strongDomainDriven Designstrong approach because the business model and logic is very complex.p  pThe project also aims to be a strongSOAstrong project Service Oriented Architecture. So Im learning a lot about Services and how to construct the project around it.p  pFollowing a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5850249zfdoctrine2heavymodelclassesorlightweightmodelservicelayerprevious question of minea, I have a question regarding strongassociations in model classesstrong.p  pI understand that model classes shouldnt know and do anything related to persistence. However I have trouble deciding for situations with association between model classes.p  pFor examplep  ul liclass codePersoncodeli liclass codeCarcode has one driver for the exampleli ul  pWhere should the codegetDrivercode and codegetCarscode bep  ol liin the model classes codecargtgetDrivercodeli liin the service layer with primitive types codepersonServicegtgetPersoncargtgetDriverIdcodeli liin the service layer using OOP codecarServicegtgetDrivercarcodeli ol  pSolution 1. seems the more natural. Im using Doctrine 2, so the model associations are handled with DB mapping annotations. That way, the model doesnt do anything related to persistence even though it strongdoesstrong through Doctrine actually. Its my favorite solution, but then whats the point of the Service except load the list of cars to start withp  pSolution 2. seems just stupid because it throws away OOP and the ModelService user has to know about the Database model to fetch association he has to know that this ID is a Person id. And he has to do the association himself.p  pSolution 3. is a bit better than solution 2, but still strongwhere is the OOPstrong in thatp  pSo, for me solution 1. is the best. But I have seen Solution 2. and Solution 3. used in real projects sometimes mixed together, and so I have doubts.p  pAnd the question becomes more complex when there are additional parameters, for examplep  precodepersongtgetCarsnameFilter, maxNumberOfResults, offset codepre  pin this case, it really looks like a SQL querypersistence queryp  pSo, which one should be used for a strongModelService architecturestrong on a project following the strongDomainDriven Designstrong approach With SOA, should my model be only dumb data container with no logic If so, then where is the DDD approachp

Negative 39464 pIm trying to retrieve a value set by a custom Tomcat Valve in a JSF2 backing bean or servlet.  I cant see how to do this and I cant find any examples using Google.p  pBACKGROUND In my JSF2 web app, Im required to add a timezone attribute to each user.  The easiest way of implementing this would be to add a timezone dropdown to the users profile page, so that each user can choose their appropriate timezone.  However this could be automated because a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1809974226513bit of JavaScript in the browsera is able to automatically calculate the timezone.p  pSo Ive put a new parameter on my Tomcat login page which supplies this value, which the web app can capture at login time.  The Tomcat form authentication mechanism is responsible for processing the login page via an HTTP POST to jsecuritycheck. I implemented a Java EE Servlet Filter to catch this, but Tomcats  login mechanism circumvents Filters, so this code would never see the POST to jsecuritycheck.p  pIve now implemented a Tomcat Valve and I can successfully catch the POST to jsecuritycheck.  In the code I extract the timezone value and put it... wherep  pI understand that the valve which has to be placed in TOMCATHOMElib has a different classloader to my regular JSF2 code.  This means that I cant access any static members of the valve from my JSF2 code.p  pSo inspired by the source code for the standard Tomcat valves, I have tried this within the valvep  precodefinal org.apache.catalina.Session session  request.getSessionInternaltrue session.setNotecom.conexa.timezoneOffset, timezoneOffset codepre  pHowever, in my JSF2 managed beans I am unable to get a reference to the org.apache.catalina.Session.p  pThis code returns an object of type StandardSessionFacade which doesnt let me get at the org.apache.catalina.Session.p  pFacesContext.getCurrentInstance.getExternalContext.getSessionfalsep  pRunning in debug mode, Ive been able to find the org.apache.catalina.Session, but the notes field is actually empty.p  pI also think that Tomcat may use one session for login and then create a new session afterwards possibly related to a hrefhttpwww.tomcatexpert.comblog20110425sessionfixationprotection relnofollowSession Fixation Protectiona.  If this is indeed the case, the problem would be compounded I think.p  pDo any Tomcat gurus have any bright ideas  A solution for plain servlets would also be acceptable because Im sure Id be able to adapt it.p

Negative 39464 pI have a lot of data which is date based in nature but with irregular reporting intervals. What I was hoping to do is to have my PHP backend send the data to the frontend JSjQuery to display but in order to report effectively I need to be able to report by week, month, etc. I could try and do the SQL on the backend and structure different data series for each interval but that would be CPU intensive on the backend and Id like the frontend to be a bit dynamic in being able to move between these intervals aka, show me monthly, no wait, show me weekly, etc.p  pWhat Im looking for  I think  is a JSjQuery library that will help me take tabular data and groupaggregate it based on date based conditions. If need be I could try adding a column to the tabular structure which specifies the week number and thereby simplifies the data math on frontend. In any case, Im flexible at the moment and just hoping to hear of some good resources or approaches that have been tried before to solve this kind of problem.p  pstrongNotestrong I am using a hrefhttpwww.trirand.comblog relnofollowjqGrida for tabular views on the frontend and a hrefhttpwww.highcharts.com relnofollowHighchartsa for graphical presentation.

Negative 39464 pI have a mobile app currently IOS and soon Android which talks to a web service. There is no login and the data is not private. Basically, the app POSTs a marker lon, lat and GETs the nearest 25 markers to display on a map.p  pIts a very trivial app and I cannot imagine anyone putting great effort into abusing the web service. However, I can see there is fun for someone in POSTing many markers. What most concerns me is someone running a script that pushes many requests using expensive bandwidth and making nonsense of my app data.p  pI am slowly reaching the conclusion this cannot be secure. The best answer is do not do this. Do not provide a web service without authentication. Not many services are so open. Googles You Tube API is open but most are not. Unfortunately, I have no choice. So after days of looking at this heres my thinking. Be aware I am very far from a security expert and I am confident my approach could be improved upon. But it might point you in the right direction. Hopefully, someone more experienced might chime in and correctimprove upon this. I found a hrefhttpwww.thebuzzmedia.comdesigningasecurerestapiwithoutoauthauthenticationthis articlea and comments particularly helpful.p  pstrongMessage Level Securitystrongp  pI will secure the msgs with a hash encryption. The clients and web service all retain a copy of a shared secret which is used as a salt to create a hash from the URL and all the POST arguments. The hash is passed as an additional argument and the hash is rebuilt and compared at the other end using the shared key as a salt. This is pretty good until you understand that any mobile client code can be reverse engineered in minutes. At which point this line of defense is utterly useless.p  pstrongClient Measuresstrongp  pThe client includes rate limiting of messages as a measure to restrict the number of messages sent by honest users. Yet again this is useless against an attacker who jailbreaks the mobile device.p  pstrongServer Side Securitystrongp  pSo the server side must have as much additional security measures as possible, to stand alone on the assumption that your client and shared secret is compromised. Here is what I havep  pOne msg arg is a UTC time which is used to limit replay attacks. This should prevent an attacker from firing the same msg at the server repeatedly.p  pThe server performs rate limiting by IP. Yes, IPs are easily spoofed and proxy switching is childs play but everything helps when you have so little.p  pOf course, the server strictly validates all arguments, uses parametised queries and doesnt return exceptions.p  pstrongTransport Level Securitystrongp  pUnfortunately, I am fairly confident that issuing individual client SSL certs is not possible without a registration process. And because I am using the msg hash check and my data is not private I am not entirely sure what SSL brings to the table. However, I will probably use SSL with one app wide cert because it adds another level of security that is easily and cheaply deployed albeit at a cost of additional connection time for every msg.p  pstrongThe Gaping Great Big Hole In My Approachstrongp  pI am warned that should the app become popular that someone will compromise the shared secret on the client. Just because they can and they will probably post it on the internet. So really it all comes down to the server side. Unfortunately, emI have no way to identify and block an attackerem.

Negative 39464 pI have a project that utilizes the Facebook SDK 3.0, which I built it in Xcode 4.3.2.  I now must update the project to Xcode 4.5 which also requires me to update the Facebook SDK to 3.1.

SO, I went through all the tutorials on the FB developers site, and changed the code that they highlighted, BUT when I put the new code in, I get all kinds of errors.

Negative 39464 phow to implement such a functionality to access private members p  pJava checks access permissions during compilation only. Are you surprised I was surprised very much to find out this fact.p  pSo you can create skeleton of the third party class even with empty implementations.. The interesting method should be protected instead of private. Now write your subclass and compile it against your stub. Then package only your subclass and try to run it with the real class. It should work. I have tried it when I had to access private method or field and it worked fine for me.p  pref. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma44400511312423httpstackoverflow.coma44400511312423ap

So, you have a main initially blank canvas area, and you drag items onto that from the toolbox to build up a model of something. Once youve dragged items into the canvas from the toolbox, you then need to be able to bring up a bunch of properties etc.. Kind of like Visio, or the workflow designer in visual studio.p  pBefore I set about building this from scratch, I was wondering if there are any toolsframeworkslibraies that will help me achieve this with minimal work. It seems to me to be a common use case so I was thinking that there should be something to help. I actually looked at rehosting the workflow designer because that has a lot of what I want to do, but since Im not in any way modelling workflows I figured that wouldnt be the best way forwards. p  pIs there anything that provides a starting point for this, or is it a case of jumping in and getting started from scratchp

Why is this not the default behavior Im unfamiliar with C, so its hard to wrap my head around it. The only time I can see when it might not be more beneficial to use a pointer is when the struct literal is unique, and wont be in use for the rest program and so you would want it to be garbage collected as soon as possible. Im not even sure if a modern language like Go even works that way. p  pMy question is this. When should I assign a pointer to a struct literal to a variable, and when should I assign the struct literal itselfp  pThanks.p

This is done fairly easily using the new Facebook iOS SDK v3.1.1. p  pThe problem is that I also want my applications to be available for any noniOS 6.0 adopters. This made me face a very ugly situation in which I need to create an elaborate social wrapper that would have to be compiled differently with different FB SDKs and to run separate code in order to support earlier iOS versions. Because a lot of the Facebook SDK already includes fallbacks and handles a lot of old, deprecated calls to the feed and dialog APIs, I figured that there must be a better way, while taking this in account, to create such a social wrapper.p  pI guess what Im asking for here is any clue as to where to proceed from here. If anyone has ever tackled this issue even in earlier versions of the SDK I would be glad to know.p  pThanks in advancep

Apparently, contentWindow.location.replace will not create an entry in the history object.  However, this caused some other issues related with the contents of count.html, which is actually a page to youtubevimeo content.  The youtubevimeo content REQUIRES that you load information via the attrsrc approach instead of .contentWindow.location.replace.  So perhaps the solution is to find a way to make attrsrc NOT create an entry with the history objectp  pstrongExperiment 2strong Another possible solution I tried was changing the order of the attrsrc and history.pushState call.  I tried calling attrsrc first then history.pushState second, and also history.pushState first then attrsrc second.  But in both cases, when I push the browsers back button, it is the iframe content that goes back first.  So theres no way for me to capture pass myself a message via the history object to do a double back, since information in the history object is available LAST in the sequence of events.p  pstrongExperiment 3strong I also tried working with History.js.

Negative 39464 pFor a custom server I intent to use  the codeint zmqpoll zmqpollitemtt  itemscode, codeint nitems, long timeout  1code. function which is I think is a wrapper around the unix poll function but includes codezmqsockettcode next to file descriptors. The function works as I expected until I press ctrlx or run codekill myserverpidcode in the terminal. I would expect that the poll to terminate with 1 or throws a codezmqerrortcode which derives from codestdexceptioncode which includes a codeerrnocode and the codestrerrcode message. This should indicate there was a interrupt. Then my server should handle the signal gracefully and save some data and shut down.p  pBelow I have a fragment of code that demonstrates the problem.

Negative 39464 pMy Visual Studio 2013 console application has suddenly started causing an access violation error just before exiting.

Also, when I run it from a command window instead of from the Visual Studio debug environment, it works.

The operating system is Windows 7, freshly installed on an older computer.p  pWhile I know that this type of error is usually cryptic and intermittent and may not have anything to do with cin.get at all, can I rule anything in or out  Since the only things I added are standard library calls, programming error on my part is not likely.  The package Im working with is very complex and fragile, but I dont know where to start in using the error information Im given to track down the problem.  Is it possible this is an operating system setting matter that doesnt require a code fix  Is it a threading issue thats outside my expertise  p

Negative 39464 pSuppose I have a single line of text that is in all caps e.g. with codetexttransform uppercasecode.  I want to center this text vertically in a codedivcode.  I dont need to worry about multiline text.p  pThere are several ways to center things vertically in CSS e.g. check a hrefhttpwww.vanseodesign.comcssverticalcentering relnofollowthisa out.  Unfortunately, all these methods take a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDescender relnofollowdescendersa into account, and my text doesnt have any descenders so it isnt centered perfectly.  Basically, I want to center the portion of the text from the baseline to the cap height.p  pIs there any way to vertically center a line of capitalized text  Right now Im using codeposition relativecode and manually tweaking it until it is centered e.g. with codetop 2pxcode, but this is clearly not a robust solution it is very dependent on the way the browser renders text, what fonts are available, etc..

Negative 39464 pIm working on a WordPress plugin that I started developing before I started using Git. At one point, I created a copy of the plugin in a different folder to experiment with an alternate way of writing one part of the plugin. I recently purchased Tower and started using Git to track changes for my plugins. Ive created a local repo using the first version of this plugin. However, Id like to add in that second version I created earlier as a branch of the main plugin.p  pUsing Tower as the OS X Git client, how does one add existing files from a different folder as a branch to an existing repop  pIve already tried Refs  Add New Local Branch, but it doesnt add the second versions files, nor does it have a way to point to those files. If I drag the second versions folder from Finder to the Tower icon, it creates a whole new repo. Would I need to do that and somehow merge that in as a branch p  pIm fairly new to Git as a whole and Im sure theres probably a way to do this easily through CLI, but Id love to make this work through Tower.p

Negative 39464 pDear stackoverflow readers,p  pToday I had the idea to build a very simple web application, which would be powered by a REST backend.

I was wrong...p  pI imported the basic Jetty server and servlet dependencies since I thought that were the only server requirements for a basic REST only Jetty server I alto tried to use the webapp

Negative 39464 pI have a divgame. In here I want some data from the server to appear. So when I use the initialize function I request data from my server in my game model with an ajax call.p  precodeGame  Backbone.View.extend      id game,      initialize function               this.model.ongetGame, function          this.model.getGame       codepre  pBecause a callback doesnt seem to work in backbone a trigger has to be made. So the app listens to the trigger codegetGamecode which is triggerd when the data from the server has been returned and saved into a variable in the model.p  pSo far so good, this all works. The only problem now is that I want my divgame to fadeIn when its done appending all data from the getGame function.p  pBut I think because off the model.ontrigger the initialize function thinks its ready after running the getGame function, without actually having the data from the server appended yet.p  pSo the parent divall running the following p  precodethis.el.appendnew Game.el codepre  palso thinks the divgame is ready and appends the divgame to itself and gives it a fadeIn.p  pdivgame doesnt contain the server data yet, so when it actually does come back the images and text pop into existence instead of fadeIn in nicely...p  pDoes some one know how to resolve this problem Thanks in advancep  pp  pSOLVEDp  pThe problem was in the asynchronous property of the .get and .post functions. This is why the initialize was ready before the results had come back from the server. I changed it into a .ajax and made the async false. Now it all loads in the order I programmedwant.p  pThank you for your detaild explaination Tallmaris, it will come in handy for sure since Ill be using a lot of triggersp
Negative 39464 pIm in the process of porting a C library to WinRT. It uses Winsock. Winsock isnt supported in WinRT. Microsoft directs you to use Windows.Networking.Sockets instead. Im running into questions trying to map the Winsock API to the Windows.Networking.Sockets API. Ive used sockets in managed code, but not in C. Im unfamiliar with the Winsock API.p  pIm sure I will run up against other questions, but first off, I need to determine the right way to get socket error codes. I think this is the correct mapping WSAGetLastError  SocketError.GetStatushresultli p  pCorrectp  ul liThis doc details possible error codes using winsock bra hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms740668vvs.85.aspx relnofollowWindows Sockets Error Codesali liThis doc details an enumeration which I think is the equivalent, but is very different bra hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappswindows.networking.sockets.socketerrorstatus.aspx relnofollowSocketErrorStatus enumerationali ul  pThe number of error codes is very different between these two. Also, WSAGetLastError returns the error status for the last Windows Sockets operation that failed, where SocketError.GetStatushresult requires an hresult as input, presumably from exception handling of a specific attempted operation. This is going to require a good bit of refactoring to make this change, so I want to make sure Ive got it right before I do the work.p  pLastly, is there a document someone can refer me to that defines the mapping Im looking forp

Negative 39464 pIm trying to work with strings. In my case i have this string p  precodeString test mntsdcardDownloadimages.jpegmntsdcardDownloadimages.jpegmntsdcardDownloadimages1.jpegmntsdcardDownloadimages2.jpeg codepre  pThis string contains 4 paths of images in my android emulator. Every path is separated by the    character as you can see. What i want to do is enough simple. I have to create a for loop where i find every single path without the    character and on each loop i need to remove the path founded, but in this case with the    character. I have implemented the code but im not understanding what im doing wrong. In fact it remove correctly the image path but not the    character. So for example after the first loop the test string become p  precodemntsdcardDownloadimages.jpegmntsdcardDownloadimages1.jpegmntsdcardDownloadimages2.jpeg codepre  pthat isnt correct because there is the    character at the start. Here there is my code.p  precodeforint i0 ilt3 i      find the characters number before you find the first    character available     int indexOfStatic  test.indexOf      this find the string that we want remove from the test string that contains all paths     int indexOfStaticToRemove  test.indexOf1       String testPath  test.substring0, indexOfStatic this is the correct path of the image     String testPathToRemove  test.substring0, indexOfStaticToRemove this is the path with the    character that we want remove from the test string     Log.iPATH TO REMOVE,testPathToRemove      here i remove the path with the    character. I use the replaceFirst method because if the test string contains two equals paths how in my example i want to replace only one at time for avoid crash during the loop     test  test.replaceFirsttestPathToRemove,     Log.iTEST REPLACE,test Replace the first  with nothing  codepre  pIm not understanding which is the problem, but in fact it shouldnt be difficult.p
Negative 39464 pHeres the situation Ive inherited the previous developer decided it was a good idea to create two stylesheets, one called main.css and the other color.css, with color.css being called inside of main.css using import.  p  pWhat that means is, there are multiple declarations for the same selector split into multiple rules across these stylesheets.  For example, in main.css there will be p  precode.contentmain        marginbottom 10px   codepre  pwhile in color.css there will bep  precode.contentmain        backgroundcolor 9D937A   codepre  pThis type rule duplication targeting the same selector is repeated through 1136 lines of CSS.  p  pBecause I find this to be completely valueless, I want to combine both stylesheets into one stylesheet while preserving the cascade of the style rules when they page is rendered in the browser.p  pRather than do this by hand, my belief rather hope is that someone has already created either a command line tool or an online tool to do this.  I have researched and found that there are a number of tools to minify, beautify andor concatenate stylesheets but I have not yet found one to combine and preserve the cascade as I am suggesting here.p  pIf such a tool exists and I missed it, please forgive me in advance.  Likewise, if this specific question has already been answered on SO and I missed it it was not for lack of trying to find it, so please accept my humblest apologies.  Otherwise, any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 39464 pI have a page that has 3 text boxes. Of the first two, only one or the other is required to be filled out, or both. The third text box is a date and is required.p  pThe issue is that if I fill in all of the fieldsthe first textbox4 char integer, the second textboxup to 9 char string and the third textboxdate and check the database using a stored procedure, it returns that it was found. Same goes if you only fill out the first and third textboxes. But if you fill out the second and third it refuses to return that it is found, even if I enter the exact information that is stored in the database.p  pThe second textbox is for a school ID number that can vary from 4 characters to 9, depending on the schools ID system, and can contain letters as well as numbers.

Negative 39464 pI have created a custom model binder to bind int, to handle when the string value is greater than int.maxvalue  we have a lot of legacy code using UpdateModel, and this method throws an exception if the string value to be converted to an int is greater than int.MaxValue.

The model binder works fine, however I have an Action similar to the followingp  precode   public ActionResult ListListCriteria criteria, int page codepre  pThe class ListCriteria has a property on it as followsp  precodepublic int Page  get set codepre  pMy custom model binder implements IModelBinder.

Negative 39464 pWe are using an oracle text query to perform a search of a table based on user input.p  pSo if the user types in blue sky  we want to search for each word on an OR basis, so we do  codewhere containscolumnname,blue or sky,1gt0codep  pso we take the user input and replace spaces with the word codeorcode before passing to the query.p  pThis works fine and we are able to order descending on the score to give us the most relevant entries first.p  pHowever we have then had problem with codespecial characterscode  it started with a comma but then I found in the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdB2835901text.111b28304cqspcl.htmCCREF2093 relnofollowdocumentationa there are loads of them.p  pSo we wrote some code which detected each codespecial charactercode and prefixed it with an codeescape  charactercode. This also works ok. But then there are also the reserved words, eg AND  so if a user types in codejack and jillcode  we convert to codejack or and or jillcode and this gives a text query parser syntax error because of the use of the word and  so then trying to cater for those too but having to try to determine where they are prefixed and suffixed with spaces so as not to pick out handy for example. Except of course it could be the first or last word.....grrr there must be an easier way to do this.....p  pThen I read up on the code braces optioncode so this escapes the whole string. p  pstrongQuestionstrong  can I just do this, even if there are no special characters in the stringp  pAlso I cant see how this caters for the OR functionality we need for each word  so if I do containscodecolumnname,jack or xxxxx,1 gt 0code it does not return anything.p  pAny advice will be greatfully received, thanksp

Negative 39464 pSorry I did not research this issue deeply on the internet or on SO. So down voting is welcome. After all I have a feeling this may be a dump question. However I am giving a shot.p  pI have a project which will contain all of the unit tests. All of the unit tests require a setup which basically creates a jndi namespace. I am doing this with Before tag on each of my unit test class. So I am doing lots of copy paste which is irritating me a little. Is there a way of creating a singleton class which creates this jndi namespace for all of my unit tests possibly with spring or any other way.p

Negative 39464 pRecently I got a task which is to generate html page based on user interactionThis is completely a webapp. User can interact through the web browser to create a template and save template . I know it is pretty simple. p  pBut the problem comes when I have to allow the users to change the div size,content size, image size etc dynamicallyusing mouse movements also user can drag drop image to html etc. As I thought it is difficult to develop the entire thing using html5 and jquery it did some googling and found the html5 canvas can do all these job we can drag drop, change size etc . Only thing which I found difficult is export it as an html5 document. Is it possible to convert the canvas element a html5 document. p
Negative 39464 pSo I have been writing some racket extensions for some C classes using the tutorial a hrefhttpdocs.racketlang.orginsideoverview.html relnofollowhttpdocs.racketlang.orginsideoverview.htmla  on the racket site and have been able to successfully load them into racket. However I was wondering if I can use inheritance to reuse some code. p  pFor example I have two classes that I have written in C, Foo and Bar. p  pClass Foo looks like this p  precodeFoo       func1   ... do stuff      codepre  pClass Bar looks like this p  precodeBar  Foo       func2  ... do more stuff     codepre  pIve currently written a single .cpp racket extension that creates Bar and creates the extensions for both func1 and func2 however, Id like to create two racket extension classes. One extension that does only functions inside Foo and then I just want to include Fooext.h my racket extension to Foo in Barext.h so I have access to all the functions. p  pSo I currently have this p  pBarext.cpp p  precodefunc1racketext  ... do racket stuff and run func1     func2racketext  ... do more racket stuff and run func2      Scheme initializes etc...  codepre  pBut what I really want is p  pFooext.h p  precodefunc1racketext  ... do racket stuff and run func1       Scheme initializes etc...  codepre  pBarext.cpp p  precodeinclude Fooext.h    func2racketext  ... do more racket stuff and run func2       Scheme initializes etc...  codepre  pIs this even possible I feel like namespace might be an issue. This would be extremely useful for me because it would allow me to not write lots and lots of redundant code since I have many classes that use class Foo as a super class. p  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated and if you could point me to an example maybe there is something in the underlying racket code you can point me to p

Negative 39464 pIm looking to use SSRS for report generation in an app and am finding that using datasets with SQL defined within the SSRS report to be quite restrictive. As far as I can see, I could get around that by actually passing the SQL query to the report as a parameter and set the dataset to use that parameter as the SQL query. I do know dynamic SQL of the sort is usually frowned upon, but I need to see what my options are.p  pSome background here, my reasoning is that I have some very complex queries, and within my PHP app I have a lot of constructs joins, subqueries, etc. abstracted out, making it much easier to formulate queries and also reusable clauses accross different parts of the app. I could probably achieve the same in the report builder using functions would still need dynamic sql, but Id still be duplicating a bunch of stuff I already have in PHP bear in mind the specific language is irrelevant since I need some of those same SQL constructs in my application. I also dont want to use stored procs, from past experience Ive found them to be a pain to work with once queries get very complicated and you have a lot of different possible conditions, it gets ugly. And dynamic SQL in stored procs is a nightmare to debug, beside making you lose the performance benefits of using stored procs.p  pSo what Im curious about is what are the performance implications of passing a SQL string to the report as opposed to having the query inline bearing in mind I would not be using stored procs no matter what. Would it somehow make the query slower, or would it be the equivalent of executing the query in PHP Secondly, what are the other problemsrisks associated with this practice Provided I sanitize the SQL prior to passing it in, would there be any other major security risks to doing this Thirdly, is there an alternative Im not thinking about that would be betterp

Negative 39464 pAssuming that the client and server send packets according to the order of sequence as shown in the figure.     The client sends hello and prints the hello message on the screen echoed by the server successfully. Then it sends hello again to the server after the server process was killed and FIN was arrived. The server responds to the client with an RST and the RST reaches the client,too. Then if the client begins to block on a read operation, why it returns 0 due to the FIN instead of 1 because the RST In the Effective TCPIP programming, it tells us that the core will return ECONNRESET error and read should return 1.

Negative 39464 pOkay, very new to both javaScript and Node.js.p  pBasically what I am trying to do is to use the asynch module a node.js module to make a number of asynchronous calls to a number of different websites.p  pFor example, just send a GET request to 5 websites, and print their response.p  pThe issue is that I am trying to use the XMLHttpRequest javascript object, but it doesnt seem to work in Node.js, saying it is undefined. I believe this is because that object needs to be used within a browser. Is this truep  pAt anyrate, how can I send a get request using Node.js Without have embedded javascript in HTML or anything like that. Strictly Node.JS.

Negative 39464 pI have found somewhat similar questions however the answers that I think could work are too complex for me to morph into what I need. I could use some help figuring out how to accomplish the following in Pythonp  pI have a CSV file which contains three columns of data. In the first column I have duplicate values as in duplicated in other rows of which I need to combine to a single row along with specific data from columns two and three. The result should be another CSV.p  pIn addition, for each set of rows that have duplicate column one data there are a number of situations for data in columns two and three which need combined. In other words, for any first instance of column one value, if value in column two is not empty, grab it and place in a final row in column two, else if column two is empty, grab value in column three and place in final row in column three. The rule I need to implement is The first and last instance of column one values need to combine whatever column two and three data exists, while maintaining column two data in column two and three in three. Also, there are never three full values in a given row of source CSV.p  pTo better explain, here are the data situated as listed in source CSV These are examples of sets of rows in source CSV that need to be combinedp  pExample1 Here I have four rows with matching column one data, as for all examples I need the result to be a row containing column one value followed by values found in first and last instance of column one value.p  precodewp.xyz03.def02.01195.1,wp03.xyz03c01lc08m00, wp.xyz03.def02.01195.1,wp02.xyz03, wp.xyz03.def02.01195.1,,wp01.def02 wp.xyz03.def02.01195.1,,wp02.def02c02lc14m00 codepre  pSo the desired result for this group would bep  precodewp.xyz03.def02.01195.1,wp03.xyz03c01lc08m00,wp02.def02c02lc14m00 codepre  pExample2 Here I have three rows with matching column one data, again I need the result to be a row containing column one value followed by values found in first and last instance of column one value.p  precodewp.atl21.lmn01.01193.2,wp03.atl21c06lc14m00, wp.atl21.lmn01.01193.2,wp02.atl21, wp.atl21.lmn01.01193.2,,wp03.lmn01 codepre  pSo the desired result for this group would bep  precodewp.atl21.lmn01.01193.2,wp03.atl21c06lc14m00,wp03.lmn01 codepre  pExample3 Here I have three rows with matching column one data, again I need the result to be a row containing column one value followed by values found in first and last instance of column one value.

It works fine when called directly, or in an iframe in a page called by most browsers tested in various versions of Firefox, Chrome, IE11, IE10 and IE9. However, in IE9, it runs excruciatingly slowly. Javascript functions bound to buttons do not respond unless the page is allowed to sit for a very long time. As the user base for my client includes a large number of users stuck with IE9 by institutional policy, this is a serious problem for my client. p  pHeres an example of the direct link to the widget a hrefhttpbankers.confedge.comapwidgetevents.cfmwidgetKey29lQuI25oLhxi0vOZwq8ampgrpMT relnofollowhttpbankers.confedge.comapwidgetevents.cfmwidgetKey29lQuI25oLhxi0vOZwq8ampgrpMTap  pHere it is in an iframe a hrefhttpwww.texasbankers.comwebTexasBankersWebinarCatalog.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.texasbankers.comwebTexasBankersWebinarCatalog.aspxap  pIt does take a while longer to load in the iframe than Id like, regardless of browser it is a very dataintensive application, but in all other browsers it is fully responsive once loaded. Only in IE9 and earlier does it hang up. I do notice a great degree of variability in the load times at different times of day, suggesting that my clients server load may be exacerbating this problem.p  pLet me know if theres any code I can provide that might help identify the problem, or if theres anything that can be done to optimize this for IE9.p

Negative 39464 pVery often, I have to use multiple libraries that handle errors differently or define their own enums for errors.  This makes it difficult to write functions that might have to deal with errors from different sources, and then return its own error code.  For examplep  precodeint dofooandbar      int err     if err  libfoodosomething lt 0           return err and indication that it was caused by foo          if err  libbardosomething lt 0           return err and indication that it was caused by bar           ...     return 0  codepre  pIve thought of two possible solutionsp  ul liCreate my own list of error codes and translate these error codes to new ones, using functions like codeint translatefooerrorint errcode, and I would write my own string representations for each error.li liCreate a codestruct myerrorcode that holds both an enum identifying the library and the error code.  The translation to string would be delegated to an appropriate function for each library.li ul  pThis seems like a problem that would come up very often, so Im curious, how is this usually handled  It seems like the former is what most libraries do, but the latter is less work and plays on the tools already provided.  It doesnt help that most tutorials just print a message to stderr and exit on any error.  Id rather have each function indicate what went wrong, and the caller can decide from that how to handle it.p

Can anyone explain to me why Seen as I can reference my codescenecode and codecameracode variables from there. p  precodeltscriptgt                 Variables                 var container, stats                 var camera, scene, renderer                 var mouseX  0, mouseY  0                 var windowHalfX  window.innerWidth2                 var windowHalfY  window.innerHeight2                 init                 animate                  Initialisation                 function init                     container  document.createElementdiv                     document.body.appendChildcontainer                     camera  new THREE.PerspectiveCamera45, window.innerWidth  window.innerHeight, 1, 2000                     camera.position.z  2                      scene                     scene  new THREE.Scene                      Light                     var ambient  new THREE.AmbientLight0x101030                     scene.addambient                     var directionalLight  new THREE.DirectionalLight0xffeedd                     directionalLight.position.set1,0,1                     scene.adddirectionalLight                      Texture                     var manager  new THREE.LoadingManager                     manager.onProgress  function  item, loaded, total                           console.logLoading   item, loaded, total                                            var texture  new THREE.Texture                     var loader  new THREE.ImageLoadermanager                     loader.loadskin.jpg, functionimage                         texture.image  image                         texture.needsUpdate  true                                           Model                     var loader  new THREE.OBJLoadermanager                     loader.loadtest.obj, functionobject                         object.traversefunctionchild                                 ifchild instanceof THREE.Mesh                                     child.material.map  texture                                                                                     Resize the object...                         object.position.y  .10                         object.position.x  .10                          Scale                         object.scale.x  0.5                         object.scale.z  0.5                         object.scale.y  0.5                          console.logobject                          scene.addobject                                           Renderer                     renderer  new THREE.WebGLRenderer                     renderer.setSizewindow.innerWidth, window.innerHeight                     renderer.setClearColorHex 0xffffff, 1                      container.appendChildrenderer.domElement                      Event Listeners                     document.addEventListenermousemove, onDocumentMouseMove, false                     window.addEventListenerresize, onWindowResize, false                                    Declaring Event Listeners                 function onWindowResize                     windowHalfX  window.innerWidth2                     windowHalfY  window.innerHeight2                     camera.aspect  window.innerWidthwindow.innerHeight                     camera.updateProjectionMatrix                     renderer.setSizewindow.innerWidth, window.innerHeight                                   function onDocumentMouseMoveevent                     mouseX  event.clientX  windowHalfX2                     mouseY  event.clientY  windowHalfY2                                  Declaring Event Listeners                  Animation                 function animate                     requestAnimationFrameanimate                     render                                   function render                     camera.position.x  mouseX  camera.position.x  .05                     camera.position.y  mouseY  camera.position.y  .05                     camera.lookAtscene.position                     renderer.renderscene, camera                              ltscriptgt codepre  pProblem is here Cant codeconsole.logobjectcode or anything.p  precodefunction render                         camera.position.x  mouseX  camera.position.x  .05                         camera.position.y  mouseY  camera.position.y  .05                         camera.lookAtscene.position                          renderer.renderscene, camera                      codepre

Negative 39464 pI have a large data frame 200k rows consisting of monthly trial data. Each variable records the result of the trial in that month positive 1 or negative 0.

Negative 39464 pIve recently been informed that my sbt plugins dont work using the magical new Auto Plugin feature, which is the recommended mechanism.p  ol liwhy are sbt doing thisli liwill all plugins have to be updatedli liwill it support sonatype snapshot releasesli ol  pIve been informed by one of our users that snapshots are not supported but I cannot find a definitive answer on this. We will have serious problems as we use rolling releases between stable releases.p  pIn my opinion, it would be a disaster if sbt expects all authors to make changes to support this. The real value in sbt is that there are so many plugins for it, and if changes are made that exclude some of those plugins then we all suffer.p

Negative 39464 pI was wondering if someone could advise me on what I might want to do in a particular situation.  I have a client who asked fro a Twitter Bootstrap based WordPress theme.  The theme has a slider carousel on the front page.  One slide has a green background, another orange, and another red.  The client showed me a site where the slider ran right up next to the top navigation bar.  When the current slide is the one with the green background, the top navigation bar is green to match... and similarly with Orange and Red.  So, when the slide changes to the image that has a background of orange the top navigation bar changes to have that same colored background.p  pI tried to use CSS3 animations to sync with the slider by setting the animation to change after 5 seconds, just as the slider was changing every 5 seconds.  The results were not so great.  I guess the problem is that the CSS3 color animation doesnt change directly from one color to another but animates the transition, going through various intermediate colors during the transition.p  pPutting the navbar inside the carousel didnt seem to work.  I was hoping that this would help me to synchronize the navbar background color styling with the slider, applying a new style class that could be targeted by CSS to change the navbar background.  This was not a good solution at all.  Depending on where I placed the navbar code, it might not show up at all or definitely in the wrong place.  p  pSo, perhaps with JQuery I could find out what slide is currently showing and use that to change the class on the navbar to display a different navbar background.  Or I could just use a timer that adds different classes at different times and then use that to change the color of the navbar background at different times, e.g. every 5 seconds. Thanks in advance for any help, Bruce    p

Negative 39464 pFirstp  ul liUsing excel 2010, Win 7li liAll additional addons have been disabledli liAll spreadsheets have had the last used cell reduced to its minimum row, column valueli liI have an old machine in todays standards, Dell Inspiron 6400, 1.73 GHz, 3.3 Gig ramli ul  pI have a spreadsheet that when open and active it uses at least 50 of the cpu even when idle.  If I then run other programs this has caused the computer to over heat and shut down.  I posted this problem on a different forum a few months ago and the end advice was, Dont worry about it.  Well, I can no longer do this.  Its become a problem.p  pAt first I thought it was any workbook with macros.  I have since convinced myself this is not the case.  I then thought it might be addons that I have add.  This isnt the case either.  I read to minimize the spreadsheets to their smallest size.  This didnt help.  This workbook has an autoopen which saves a backup, gathers some data off the internet and does some manipulations with that data. I totally removed this subroutine, and no effect.  Another thing to note is if I open another workbook, leaving this open too, and make this second workbook the active workbook, te cpu usage goes to nearly zero.  One last thing to note is I have several precursors to this final version of this workbook.  They all do not have this cpu problem.  Somewhere, somehow, I have added some code to this final version that is causing this problem.p  pIm hoping someone can give me some clues as to what else to look for.  I will be comparing these old backups to the current version, but this is going to be the long way around.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.p

In my bootstrap dialog box, the form was loaded and it has a button that listens to an event where enter key is pressed and it works fine but if the percentage field is focused and the enter key is hit the page redirect to the form action and not performing the ajax call.

Negative 39464 pI have a question. I have a method codeProcessrequestcode which supports multithreading, can each thread create one class instance of codeRequestclasscode and work on its own.p  pEg.,p  precodepublic class Requestclass  producerclass       public override string Generaterequest    public class producerclass      public virtual string Generaterequest      Public void Processrequest         string request  Generaterequest         HttpWebRequest here          process the request here        codepre  pFor one instance of Requestclass, it works fine. But I would like to know how to proceed in this scenariop  ol liI have multiple request classli liThese request class name will be dynamic.li liSince it supports multithreading i.e., each thread should process one request class concurrently.li ol  pEdit If I have multiple Requestclass, how to create instance in Processrequest method.

Negative 39464 pI use gcc on Ubuntu to compile a c program that had few string values that I dont want the end user to know. Like strings used in authentication , a passcode file path  passcode etc. but when I compile the program the object file has these string values in readable text format. there are other machine only readable characters but these strings are also present in the file. Is this expected  is there a way to tell the compiler not to print the values as plain text. I thought of having the strings encrypted within the program, but that looks like over engineering. p

Negative 39464 pIm learning about Concurrency and how the OS handles interrupts such as moving your cursor across the screen while a program is doing some important computation like large matrix multiplications. p  pMy question is, say youre on those old computers with a single core on it, wouldnt that single core need to constantly contextswitch to handle your interrupts because of all the cursor moving and therefore more time is needed for the important computation But I assume its not that huge of a delay because perhaps the OS will prioritize my calculation above my interrupts Maybe skip a few frames between the movement. p  pAnd if we move to a multicore system, is this generally less likely to happen as the cursor moving will probably be processed by another core So my calculations will not really be that delayed p  pWhile I am at this, am I right to assume that the singlecore computer probably goes through like hundreds of processes and it contextswitches throughout all of them So quite literally, your computer is doing one instruction at a time for a certain amount of time a time slice and then it needs to switch to another process with a different set of instructions. If so, its amazing how the core does so much.... Jump, get the context, do a few steps, save the context onto stack, jump yet again. Rinse and repeat. Theres obviously no parallelism. So no two instructions are EVER running at the same time. It only gives that illusion. p

Negative 39464 pIm trying to write an android app that contains a database that would dynamically change its schema based on user input.p  pFor example, suppose that you initially have a table in which the only column is a column for different breeds of puppies.

Negative 39464 pI am sure someone has run across this issue before, I just havent been able to find anything on it anywhere.  Anyway here is the scenario.p  pI have a PHP website that a user will login, then their account id is set as a session variable, then once they are in it basically acts as a single page app.  The session account id is for tracking their activities as they do different things throughout the app.p  pThe site will be accessed primarily on mobile devices.  I have PHP that sets the session timeout length, then using JS, gives them a popup warning a couple minutes before the timeout ends.  Then after the end of the timeout, using a meta refresh, it redirects them back to the login page.p  pOn a desktop, this all works like it is supposed to.  On mobile, it is behaving differently.  On a mobile device, a user may login, do some stuff on a page, then without logging out, put their phone in their pocket and not come back to it for a couple hours.  When they open up the browser it keeps them on the page they were on, but the JS was obviously not running during the time their phone was sleeping, or whatever else they were doing in the interim. The meta refresh as well also does not work as expected, but the session is still timed out.  So when they open the app back up, and try to do stuff, I am getting errors in the DB saying that id cannot be empty.p  pI can use ajax to check if their session still exists on every click of a button, but for speed of the app I would prefer not to do that.p  pHas anyone else ran into this and found a solution for automatically logging out people on single page apps viewed on a mobile devicep

Negative 39464 pthis is my first question on Stack Overflow and Im nonprogrammer trying to pick it up. Familiar with HTML, CSS, starting to get into a bit of PHP, did some tutorials on JavaScript and Ruby on Rails but forgot most of that stuff.p  pIm currently doing a writing project, where Im writing 1,000 blogposts of 1,000 words each, published to a Wordpress blog, hosted on BlueHost. Im up to about 315 posts published, which means 315,000 words and 315 publishing dates. When I finish the project, it will be over 1,000,000 words and 1,000 published posts. With about another 100 summary posts, and probably a 100 more common threads or themes posts.p  pIm hoping to use this project to as motivation teach myself some programming. For example, I want to print a graph of all the publish dates of my blogposts, so I can see at a glance what my publishing frequency is like.p  pFor the time being, Ill be happy just to be able to look at a graph that was generated by anything other than my own manual labor.

Negative 39464 pI have a WiX package that should always deliver files, but should only uninstall the files when a condition is met.

The date is the indexed primary key no duplicates. p  pstrongWhen a user creates a new record I would like the date to autofill based on the last record.strong p  pSo if the last estimate was for 07022015, the date for the new record should autofill as 07032015.

Second i have this question wich appear like never asked before  how to get the characters from a passworded files like zip or winrar by brute forcing ofcourse but with this Steps  treating the hash file of this protected file and start detect first the length of the password if it is possible and after try to Smart Detect the first word or character of the password one by one and When each one is detected we Skip it and save it as part from this password and Start again to Detect the next ... And so on... and this is the best and the fast way to get passwords in few minutes . finally im just asking if it is possible  thats all. Thanks.p
Negative 39464 pIm using the following code in order to check when the user clicks a crossdomain iframep  precodevar myConfObj     iframeMouseOver  false  window.addEventListenerblur,function   ifmyConfObj.iframeMouseOver     console.logWow Iframe Click      document.getElementByIdYOURCONTAINERID.addEventListenermouseover,function    myConfObj.iframeMouseOver  true  document.getElementByIdYOURCONTAINERID.addEventListenermouseout,function     myConfObj.iframeMouseOver  false  codepre  pIm using this to check if a user clicked a Google Ad, and it works fine the first time you click it. However the second click on the banner doesnt get registered unless you refresh the page again.p  pWhat Ive noticed, though, is that if I click anywhere OUTSIDE the iframe after the first click, and then I click the banner again, the click gets registered.p  pWhat I tried to do was use window.focus on mouseover, but it doesnt fix it.p  pCan you help mep
Negative 39464 pThis is my first question on stackoverflow. Pardon me if I havent searched properly but I do not seem to find an explanation for this. Was just attempting an example from Bjourne Stroustroups papers. Added my bits to see the array get resized as I type the text.p  pBut it doesnt seem to work that way getchar simply waits till I am done with entering all the characters and then it will execute the loop. As per the logic, it doesnt actually go into the loop, get a character, perform its actions and then iterate. I am wondering if this is implementation specific, or intended to be like thisp  pI am on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using Codeblocks with gcc 4.8.2.

Negative 39464 pIf you would like to present a view controller modally yet continue to see the underlying view controller, you can change the codeUIModalPresentationStylecode to Over Full Screen, then set the views codebackgroundColorcode to codeclearColorcode, or a color with a lowered alpha value. The default Full Screen presentation causes the underlying controller to disappear, so youll see black underneath unless you use Over Full Screen or Over Current Context.p  pNow I would like to instead use the adaptive Popover presentation style, which will cause the view controller to be presented full screen on the iPhone in portrait or in a form sheet if run on iPhone 6 Plus in landscape. But I want to preserve the over full screen style  I want to be able to see the underlying view controller through the new view controller. How can that be accomplished, when by default it disappears therefore is black underneathp

Negative 39464 pi am doing implementation of web service discovery and semantic web service discovery. UDDI and ebXML are the traditional approach for web service discovery. UDDI is the de facto standard. There are many custom proprietary solutions for the web service discovery and semantic web service discovery in the literature. Solutions like using peer to peer architecture with agent based programming. Another solutions uses the hadoop ecosystem for entire web service processes management.p  pService Registry contains information about web services and have a web service that will perform the discovery of web service from the catalogue. I want to know that what logic it contains to perform the web service discovery task. Does it parse the WSDLs early and store that metadata in table Does it parse the WSDLs for operation name,input parameter and output parameterp  pfor the semantic web service discovery,  suppose we have parse the WSDLs for operation name, input and output. Stored that information in relational database. creating RDF form of that relation databse. Perfoming the Sparql query on that RDF. I dont know where the ontologies for that semantic web service discovery comes into picture. where do we have to use the ontologies of those web services to perform the semantic web service discoveryp

Here is result set i want to getp  precode    Item No              Level Code       100A                   1       100B                   2       100C                   2       100D                   3       100B                   3       100F                   3 codepre  pYou can see 100A will not be assigned with level 3 since it is already there for that branch on level 1. But 100B is assigned with both level 2 and 3 which is not violate the rule. Any help will be appreciated p
