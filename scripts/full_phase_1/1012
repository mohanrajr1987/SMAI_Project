That is, it should say something likep  precodeFile name is abc.txt Last modification date is 20091231T0123 Readonly attribute is True Hidden attribute is False codepre  pThe listings will persist for years in a longterm archive, so the language should be selfevident to an information archaeologist of the future.

Can anyone point me to a language which already exists for describing hierarchical structures of file attributes and directory attributes, as in a file system  Im hoping to benefit from the work those language designers did to get the semantics right, create the schema or DTD, work out the niggling details of whether something should be an XML element or attribute, etc.p  pIve looked in the obvious places ema hrefhttpxml.coverpages.com relnofollowhttpxml.coverpages.comaem, web search engines, the archives of emXMLLem and emcomp.text.xmlem, and here.  I didnt find any traces of such languages.  The search was complicated a bit because the search term file attributes gets lots of hits on the term attributes as used in XML. p  pPlease suggest languages I should investigate.

I also have a button at the botton of that list, which should add the whole list of items.p  pIt seems to me that the easiest way to do this is to trigger the click event for all these icons the reason Im doing it via the icons is that itemsspecific values are stored as attributes of the div in which the icon resides.p  pHowever, I cant get it to work the event handlers for the individual icons work perfectly, and the event handler for the addthemall button does give me an alert if I put that in.

Negative 1012 h1The problemh1  pIve been struggling with this partiular problem for two days now and just run out of ideas. A little... background we have a WinForms app that needs to access a database, construct a list of related inmemory objects from that data, and then display on a DataGridView. Important point is that we first populate an appwide cache List, and then create a mirror of the cache local to the form on which the DGV lives using List constructor param.p  pBecause fetching the data takes a good few seconds DB sits on a LAN server to load, we decided to use a BackgroundWorker, and only refresh the DGV once the data is loaded. However, it seems that doing the loading via a BGW results in some memory leak... or an error on my part. When loaded using a blocking method call, the app consumes about 30MB of RAM with a BGW this jumps to 80MB While it may not seem as much anyway, our clients are not too happy about it.p  h1Relevant codeh1  pstrongFormstrongp  precodeprivate void MyFormLoadobject sender, EventArgs e      MyRepository.Instance.FinishedEvent  RefreshCache  private void RefreshCacheobject sender, EventArgs e      dgvProducts.DataSource  new ListltMyDataObjgtMyRepository.Products  codepre  pstrongRepositorystrongp  precodeprivate static ListltMyDataObjgt Products  get set  public event EventHandler ProductsLoaded  public void GetProductsSync      ListltMyDataObjgt p      using MyL2SDb db  new MyL2SDbMyConfig.ConnectionString              p  db.PRODUCTS         .Selectp gt new MyDataObj Id  p.ID, Description  p.DESCR         .ToList           Products  p       tell the form to refresh UI     if ProductsLoaded  null         ProductsLoadedthis, null    public void GetProductsAsync      using BackgroundWorker myWorker  new BackgroundWorker              myWorker.DoWork  delegate                      ListltMyDataObjgt p             using MyL2SDb db  new MyL2SDbMyConfig.ConnectionString                              p  db.PRODUCTS                 .Selectp gt new MyDataObj Id  p.ID, Description  p.DESCR                 .ToList                           Products  p                    tell the form to refresh UI when finished         myWorker.RunWorkerCompleted  GetProductsCompleted         myWorker.RunWorkerAsync        private void GetProductsCompletedobject sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e      if ProductsLoaded  null         ProductsLoadedthis, null  codepre  h1Endh1  pGetProductsSync or GetProductsAsync are called on the main thread, not shown above.

Negative 1012 pI used to be a C expert a decade ago, but for the past 10 years Ive been programming Java. I just started a C project that uses a small thirdparty XML parser. The XML parser accepts an STL istream. My XML data is coming from a Windows COM IStream. I thought Id do the Right Thing and create an adapter to take the IStream data and present it to the XML parser through an istream.p  pI followed the excellent tutorial at a hrefhttpwww.mredd.co.ukblogbeginnersguidestreambufhttpwww.mredd.co.ukblogbeginnersguidestreambufa and created a COMStreambuf that takes data from the underlying COM IStream, and used it as a buffer for a custom COMIstream. Everything looks good, but I get a read error from the parser.p  pTurns out the parser reads the whole file into memory by using seekg on the istream to find out its size and then goes back to the beginning with seekg to read it in one go. Unsurprisingly, the aforementioned tutorial decided to save [instructions on implementing seeking] for another post which was apparently never written.p  pCan someone tell me what I need to do to implement seekg with my custom istreamstreambuf I would venture out doing it myself my first inclination would be to override stuff in istream, but with my inexperience this deep in the STL and with my Java mentality I fear I would do something incomplete and have a brittle solution. Without reading tutorials, for example, I never would have guessed that one makes a custom istream by writing a new streambuf, for example, or that I would need to call imbue with a default locale, etc.p  pThanks for any help.

Negative 1012 pOur project is a content management system supporting several dozen of our websites.  The development group started off small and in one location, and we dealt with a fairly standard codingdeployment strategy.p  pWe coded off of trunk and insisted on a clean trunk.  Every few days we would tag trunk and deploy to the test server.  If all worked out, wed deploy to Production and move on.p  pThat worked well for a while until the team grew.  We frequently faced situations where the revision that was tagged had problems that needed to be fixed before going to Production.  While the developer responsible was working on those fixes, we had other developers committing changes to trunk.  Once the original developers fixes were complete, the new commits that were added would have to go along for the ride, further delaying the build because now theres additional validation that needs to be done.p  pIn an attempt to rectify this, we created a separate trunk used strictly for releases.  People would work in the main trunk, and then ask the project manager or development lead to merge their changes into the release trunk.p  pThis worked for a while until the team got even bigger and more disjoint.  We have teams of 35 people working in 4 geographic locations  some on the same components, others on different components with different priorities and release schedules.  This was pretty much a fulltime job and became a nightmare for the person managing the builds.p  pIn an attempt to work around that, we started creating release branches off of whatever the latest Production tag was.  People would commit to there ONLY what is ready to be tested and go to Production.  Others would commit to trunk until it was their turn to merge.  That took the burden of merging and resolving conflicts off of the build manager and on to the person owning the code.p  pThis worked for about a week until we started having to do several high priority emergency releases.  This effectively  meant that we wouldp  ol liCreate a branch off of the latest Production tagli liAdd the emergency stuff to that branchli liTag that branch and release to Productionli liMerge all of the changes that were made in that branch into the regular release branch that is sitting in QA.li ol  pThis is every day.  Sometimes twice a day.p  pIve tried to relate this a bit to an open source project where there are developers all over the place who dont even know each other and they still seem to get by... but that comparison falls apart when new stable, tested, productionworthy builds are expected for public consumption several times a week or day.  If Firefoxs daily build is a buggy mess, for example, at least users can go back to a previous version or use the latest stable release.  Thats not the case for our users.  If our release is not perfect, they cant work.p  pBackstory completed, I now pose the questionp  pGiven an environment where...p  ol liDevelopers are all over the place and working on different components.li liChanges to some components can wait a week before being released, others cant wait even a day.li liThe application is missioncritical and changes must be tested and stable before being released.li ol  p... what suggestions or alternative workflows can you recommend to promote a saner process where the majority of the burden is not on one personp
Negative 1012 pI know 3D rotation is well documented on SO and many other sites, but despite reading countless explanations I still havent figured out where Im going wrong.

Rather than paste a patchwork of my dismal code, Im including an image describing my problem. What Id really like is a stepbystep worded breakdown of how to solve it. Pseudo code is useful, but I will learn more if someone will just aim me in the right direction or point out common pitfalls.p  hr  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjsAwk.jpg altalt textp  pRed  XAxis, Green  YAxis, Blue  ZAxisp  pMagenta vectors  origin  some X,Y,Z pointp  pMagenta cube  average of the endpoints of the two magenta vectors is there a better name for thisp  pWhite vector  cross product of the two magenta vectors extended for display, actual vector is normalizedp  pCyan cube object  rotation failp  hr  pIve previously used Away3D and Papervision in these libraries, applying Euler angles to an objects rotationX, rotationY, or rotationZ properties will rotate the object locally, as if its at the origin regardless of its actual position. With Three.js, this is not the case. Modifying an objects rotation.x and rotation.y properties produces a bizarre effect where the object apparently tilts a bit on the Z axis. Even more confusing is that this happens when the object rests at the origin. I thought that maybe using QuaternionMatrix or AxisAngleMatrix functions would solve my problem, but no dice. It seems theres a core concept Im not getting.p  pAnyway, what Id like to do is orient the cube to the cross product vector white, so that the top of the cube is facing the direction of that vector. Then Id like to rotate the cube along the same axis. The image Ive attached shows the result of more hours than Id like to admit trying to achieve this result.

Negative 1012 pI want to create one so that I could check whether a certain word is in the set using setfindp  pHowever, Cstrings are pointers, so the set would compare them by the pointer values by default.

The word I might want to check could be part of a longer string, and I dont want to create a new string due to performance concerns.

Negative 1012 pI have a website that allows users to upload a csv file. This calls a service that reads the information from the csv, puts it into DynamicEntity objects and calls the CRM service to CreateUpdate entities in CRM. When this service createsupdates an entity this kicks off other plugins to apply certain business rules. These rules can also Create or Update entites in CRM. p  pThe issue here is that the handle count of the w3wp.exe process that the website is calling increases every time the an entity is created or updated and it never comes back down. p  pI tried putting Garbage Collection code in the business rules and this reduces the handle count of the CRM w3wp process run by the Network Service, but not the other w3wp process. Should I have Dispose methods on the Web Service that calls the CRM service p  pI hope that makes sense. Im not overly familiar with memory management issues so any help is appreciated. Can anybody give me some tips on how to stop this from occurring p  pThanks, Neilp  p EDIT Okay well the handle count goes up when I call the Service.CreateDynamicEntity method. I dont think placing any code here would be beneficial. When I exit the methodclassservice that contains this call the handle count stays as it is. What I need to know is whether this is something I should be managing or is it something CRM takes care of or doesnt take care of but I cant do anything about itp  p Another Editp  pRight this is how it works. p  p1 We have CRM and its related servicesp  p2 We have another service independent of CRM that uses the CRM services number 1 above to create entities based on csv info passed into itp  p3 We have a website that allows a user to upload a csv, and calls service no 2 above to CreateUpdate entities in CRMp  p4 We have plugins fired by CRM which use Service 1 above to createupdate entitiesp  pSo the user uploads a csv to the website 3, this fires a service2. When service 2 creates an entity using service 1, Service 4 fires. Service 4 calls also uses service 1 to Create entities, and when these services are called using the Service.Create method the handle count of the process increases. When the methodclassservices finish the handle count remains the same, and so when the whole process occurs again the handle count will increased again.p

Negative 1012 pHere is some background on the problem.  p  pWe have a database of vehicles.  The data is purchased from a third party and imported.  Some columns in the database have symbols in their values Trade mark, Copyright etc...p  pexamplep  pKawasaki Ninja ampreg tm.p  pWe have a Controller which handles the displaying the vehicles from a database but one of the parameters from the route is used as a criteria in pulling data from the database.p  pSo we will have routes that look like thisp  pKawasakiNinjap  pwhich will display all Kawasaki Ninja bikes.  There is a single action in the controller which takes the values from the route Kawasaki and Ninja and generates a SQL statement to pull all Kawasaki Ninjas from the database.  Here is where the problem is the data in the database is not always going to be clean like I stated above it will have different symbols.  p  pIs there a elegant solution to this where I can easily look up data in my database by using the Route that zend provides me.  Having the special characters in the URL isnt a valid solution according to the business rules so that has been ruled out.  We have also looked into cleaning the data in the database and removing any unwanted symbols.  That however would require changes to the way data is imported or having a script run through the database and do cleaning.  We would like to be able to leave the data in tact and avoid any type of wild card searches against the database.  This mapping needs to be able to be done both ways from the database to url and the url to databasep  pThanks in advancep
Negative 1012 pGood day everyone.p  pRecently I was given a task to develop an application to automate some aspects of stocks trading. While working on initial architecture, the database dilemma emerged. What I need is a fast database engine which can process huge amounts of data coming in very fast. Im fairly experienced in general programming, but I never faced a task of developing a highload database architecture. I developed a simple MSSQL database schema with several manytomany relationships during one of my projects, but thats it.p  pWhat Im looking for is some advice on choosing the most suitable database engine and some pointers to various manuals or books which describe highload database development.p  pSpecifics of the project are as followsp  ul liOS Windows NT family Server 2008  7li liPrimary platform .NET with Cli liDatabase structure one table to hold primary items and two or three tables with foreign keys to the first table to hold additional information.li liDatabase SELECT requirements Need superfast selection by foreign keys and by combination of foreign key and one of the columns presumably DATETIMEli liDatabase INSERT requirements The faster the better li ul  pIf therell be significant performance gain, some parts can be written in C with managed interfaces to the rest of the system.p  pSo once again given all that stuff I just typed, please give me some advice on what the best database for my project is. Links or references to some manuals and books on the subject are also greatly appreciated.p  pEDIT Ill need to insert 35 rows in 2 tables approximately once in 3050 milliseconds and Ill need to do SELECTs with 02 WHERE clauses with similar rate.p

Negative 1012 pLet me use a piece of code and a more succinct description instead.p  precodeimport numpy as np from PIL import Image as im  realimg  im.opentest.jpg.convertL comment the .convertL and it no longer works oldimg  np.arrayrealimg newimg  np.zerosoldimg.shape for irow in xrangeoldimg.shape[0]     for icol in xrangeoldimg.shape[1]         newimg[irow][icol]  oldimg[irow][icol] newrealimg  im.fromarraynewimg.convertL comment the .convertL and it no longer works newrealimg.savetest2.jpg codepre  pThis code just takes an image and tries to copy it in my code Im doing more than that, but this is enough for the example as this illustrates my problem. If you run it as is with an image called test.jpg at the same folder, it works. However, if you remove the codeconvertLcode on the two lines it appears, it no longer works. I also cant convert it to codeRGBcode or some other useful format.p  pSo the problem seems that I cant use ndarrays with PIL as long as Im using color images. Is there a way to fix thisp

Negative 1012 pI got stumped within my code. I think classes will be simpler than structures, but the chapter within my book makes me do structures.   I am currently getting an error message that my function was not matched up for an overloaded function. The book does talk about them, but the examples of overloading functions in the book arent helping me out. Also the book wants me to enter account numbers and fill in the objects and when they are asked for an account number they should have the opportunity to QUIT entering numbers and proceed onto the next part of the program that whole way of thinking has my brain a bit fried and I was hoping I could get some help. I apologize if the formatting of my code is messy, I tried to reformat it within here so it would all go into the code brackets.p  pThe Error happens at line... 161 at the displayAccounts function. Parameters were different within the top and bottom of the two functions I changed it and it works. I am going to go over different parts and if its correct post the correct code.p  pI figured out exactly the question that I need. I need the QUIT loop to be allowed to be followed up within the account numbers. This would allow the user to enter in a 0 at any time when asked to enter an account number and this was what was confusing me the most.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltiomanipgt  using namespace std  struct BankAccount      void enterAccountsDataBankAccount accounts     void computeInterestBankAccount accounts     void displayAccountsBankAccount accounts, const int QUIT      int accountNum  holds the account number.     double accountBal  holds the account balance.     double annualInterest  holds the interest rate.     int term  holds the term for the accounts.   int main      const int MAXACCOUNTS  100  The maximum number of bank accounts.     const int QUIT  0  sentinal value.     int input     int num  0     BankAccount data[MAXACCOUNTS]     BankAccount display      cout ltlt Enter  ltlt QUIT ltlt  to stop, otherwise enter 1 and procreed.     cin gtgt input      whiletrue              ifinput  QUIT                      data[MAXACCOUNTS].enterAccountsDatadata             data[MAXACCOUNTS].computeInterestdata                  else                      break                    display.displayAccountsdata, QUIT     systempause     return 0   void BankAccountenterAccountsDataBankAccount accounts      cout ltlt setprecision2 ltlt fixed      const int NUMOFACCOUNTS  100  the number of bank accounts. change the number for more bank accounts     int found     int quit  0       First for loop which asks and holds the account information     entered in by the user.      forint num  0 num lt NUMOFACCOUNTS num              do                      found  0             cout ltlt Enter in account   ltlt num  1 ltlt endl             cin gtgt accounts[num].accountNum  holds the value of the account number               Checks if the account number is valid.             whileaccounts[num].accountNum lt 999  accounts[num].accountNum gt 10000                              cout ltlt Account number must be four didgets ltlt endl                 cin gtgt accounts[num].accountNum                           Checks if the account numbers are the same.             forint check  0 check lt num check                              whileaccounts[num].accountNum  accounts[check].accountNum                                      cout ltlt endl ltlt Account Numbers cannot be the same, enter in a new account number. ltlt endl                     found  1                     break                                        whilefound  end of do while.

Negative 1012 pDear All,  I am working on a Java script capable of loading historical market data from files to MySQL tables, where each data record contains date and timestamp field. A usual record is represented asp  p01112010,100000.007,P,210.8,210.86,6,2,R,,2486662,P,P,,0,,N 01112010,100000.577,W,210.51,211.61,1,1,R,,2487172,W,W,,0,,Np  pwhere the first column represents date and the second represents timestamp with a millisecond granularity. Since MySQL do not support millisecond granularity, I am using BIGINT long representation of the timestamp field.p  pCurrently the load query is as followsp  precodeLOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE path to file  INTO TABLE table FIELDS TERMINATED BY , date, time, remaining columns ...

Ive tried different format patterns but am having problems working out the conversion from string to timestamp, before converting to unix timestamp. Google isnt helping either. I would really appreciate if anyone could suggest reasonable solution. Unfortunately, changing MySQL to other database is not an option.p  pRegards,p

Negative 1012 pHey guys, Im implementing a Table View into my project. First I populated my table, then I manage to successfully create 4 categories and give a number of rows in each of those categories, but heres my problem. The first category which has 7 objects is working fine when each data in that category opens their own nib files. But on the second category which has 3 objects, the 3 objects are actually opening nib files from the first category, which is not what I want. I created and assigned each objects in my Table View their own nib files to open, but like I said the objects from the second and also the third and fourth categories are opening the nib files from the first category.

Up until that moment, the develop branch reflected changes for the next release, but it is unclear whether that next release will eventually become 0.3 or 1.0, until the release branch is started.

Prior to switching to a release branch, what version does a ticket belong to when in the development branch Do you have a version in your issuetracker for every branch p  pAnd what about feature tickets that you know you are going to implement not in the upcoming release but in the release thereafter Am I supposed to create a version upcoming and future for this kind of ticketsp  pAny insight in how this branching workflow reflects in ticketissue management is appreciatedp

Otherwise, the initial URL is   processed as usual.p blockquote  pSo following this logic, foo.combar is successfully caught by my 404 url expression before it can be redirect to my foo.combar url expression. strongpWhat is the best way to maintain a friendlycustom catchall 404 page while also being able to use APPENDSLASH or something with similar functionalitystrongp  pbr br emstrongeditanswerstrongem pSomehow I missed that you just need to add a template named 404.html, and also make sure DEBUG  False pThanks DTingp

Negative 1012 pI have a fairly complicated web application that is written using Grails. I am trying to set up a functional testing framework, initially using Selenium, but have run into two problems.p  ol lipPart of the page I wish to test involves a treelike data structure that is displayed using jstree. The problem here is that the action I wish to simulate  the user clicking on a node to display its children  seems to be triggered by a click on a specific coordinate within a div, which is proving hard to test. I have managed to work around the problem by opening this node using Javascript passed directly to the browser by Seleniums executeScript method.pli lipThe webapp makes heavy use of file uploads, and this is something that I definitely need to test. There is no straightforward way to submit file uploads using Selenium.pli ol  pWhat is the best way of going about this I am considering trying Tellurium but its not clear from my reading whether or not file uploads work or iMacros on the assumption that a browser extension will handle file uploads better. This cant be a rare situation that Im in can anybody suggest a better alternative p

One can be misled if one thinks that everything is OK, if after doing the changes, the Perl program runs OK after doing some tests to check.p  pA comprehensive test suite might be a solution, but this is always going to be custom to the program and takes additional time to implement, when time is scarce.p  pRather, I think an effective tool would be generic to blanket exerciseparsewhatever every execution path e.g. checking for undeclared variables, change to functionsubroutine names e.g. due to refactoring etc.p  pI have ActiveState Komodo IDE which does a good job at detecting errors but being a commercial tool, I wont always be able to use it in all the environments I work in. So I would prefer something free and open source.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThanks Nylon Smile for PerlCritic  the answer below  I didnt have it as standard in my Perl setup so had to use cpan to try to install it, of course p  pIm seeing lots of Successes in the verbose install progress see below, but a few failures too  and also a Bailing out the installation for PerlCritic1.116 which doesnt look good p  pThis is not uncommon whenever I try to install or upgrade Perl modules.

For example, a customer calls in and we need a technical resource to make a return call to diagnose the issue in detail, so a Task is assigned to that resource.  Once that Task has been marked as completed, Id like the Status to be updated.  I tried creating a workflow using codeJoinFieldValuecode, which wasnt working.  I tried a more basic approach and tried to just have a field on the Service Request be populated with the Status of the Task, but that did not work either.p  pUpon further investigation in the Help File, there is a relationship from the Activity object to the Service Request object, but not one the other way.p  pSo, has anyone else run into this limitation and found some other method to have a Status change on the Task update the Status of a Service Requestp  pAlso, Id like to try and avoid writing a custom web service for this purpose, which is why Im trying to use the tools in the appp  pThanks in advance for any ideasp

The first picture is the WF Service that has the two entry points for the workflow  the second is the workflow itself.p  pThis workflow is an orchestration mechanism that constantly restarts itself, and has some failover mechanisms e.g. exit on error threshold and soft exit so that we can manage our queue of durable transactions using WFp  pNow, we had this workflow working great when it was all one WF Service because we could call the service, get a response back and send the value of that response back into another entry point in a trigger to issue a soft exit.  However, a new requirement has arrisen asking us to make the workflow itself a WF activity in another project and have the ReceiveSendReply sequences in the WF Service Application project.p  pHowever, we need to be able to startup this workflow and forget about it  then let it know somehow that a soft exit is necessary later on down the road  but since WF executes on a single thread this has become a bit challenging at best.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwWxhE.png altWF Service Sequencep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTFnLe.png altWF Activity Sequencep

Negative 1012 pSome servers want permissions at 777, some block any files at more than 755, some block the chmod function you want to use to change it anyway, etc etc. I want to use filegetcontents to write simple files to servers, but in scripts that are going to be distributed and used on many different servers that are quite varied. Assuming at least PHP5, what is the most crossserver and crosshost way to writeoverwrite a simple text file I was previously using something like thisp  precodechmodfilePath, 0755 result  fileputcontentsfilePath, fileData codepre  passuming it would work on as many servers as possible set the permissions right if you can, but without errors if you cant cuz some servers the fileputcontents works fine but it throws an error at the chmod that wasnt actually needed, but other servers need the chmod. But there has to be a solution that works on dang near every server imaginable assuming PHP5. Does anyone here have more experience with a better wayp  pstrongCLARIFICATIONSstrongp  pIm not expecting anyone to save the world, maybe it cant work for EVERY server, but we can still make it work on as many as possible, and thats what Im hoping to accomplish. Lets at least exhaust all ways of solving as many problems as we can, and attempting to write it in as many ways as we can.p  pFor examplep  precodefileputcontentsfilePath, fileData codepre  pWrites files. Yay But on some servers or in some situations it may fail because of file permissions. Dang. So lets make it a bit better.p  precodechmodfilePath, 0777 fileputcontentsfilePath, fileData codepre  pNow it changes the permission first Cool, works on a few more peoples servers But wait, some servers reject 0777, so maybe 0755 is going to work for a few more servers than 0777 would.p  precodechmodfilePath, 0755 fileputcontentsfilePath, fileData codepre  pSweet, now it works for more peoples servers. But wait some servers block the chmod function. But that doesnt mean that the file isnt writable already, that was just a backup just in case it wasnt writable, so still at least try to write it, but make it not throw errors on the servers where chmod doesnt work, since it may very well work anyway and we can always test whether it did afterwards so it doesnt fail silently.p  precodechmodfilePath, 0755 fileputcontentsfilePath, fileData codepre  petc etc etc. See how Im adding functionality to try more ways of making it work while making sure I dont break places where it already would have worked Im not asking anyone to make chmod work no matter what. Im asking if anyone has experience continuing down this path of thought, has found more places where file writing fails that can be avoided and accounted for them in a snippet of theirs until it is the best file writing snippet that it can be, working in as many places as it can. Maybe not everywhere, but in more places that the above snippet does. I know theres gotta be someone with experience on more varied server environments than me and can do it or already has done it better than I can, so Im askingp  pstrongADDITION BASED ON FEEDBACKstrongp  p1 One feedback is that permissions dont work different on different servers. Technically, yes. But in certain ways its not that simple.p  pSome servers are set up to...rebel is as good a word as any...if you set your file permissions more loose than 755, such as 777, and not let the file be readwrittenexecuted at all, just return a 500 error. On other servers, your php code seems to not be the owner of the file according to the server, and in that case Im assuming group needs to be 7 as wall, or the file ownership would need to change which brings up a whole other group of crossserver intricacies. I admit I could be understanding the root of whats going on incorrectly and thats yet another thing Im hoping to clear up if thats the case, someone having a deeper understanding of the problem and presenting a more elegant solution because of it, but I can very much tell you that simply trying to set the permissions to 755 and then use fileputcontents very much strongdoes notstrong work on every server as it should in theory in fact Id say it only works on about 90ish of the servers my clients have installed this type of code snippet on. So Im asking if anyone has dealt with many servers in this way, and has a more bulletproof method one that can make its way around the various differences between how random hosts set up their servers. Id assume it would have multiple steps of first ensuring that the file is writable and then multiple attempts at various ways of writing the file itself.p  p2 and yes, the file needs to persist, that is the whole point  Such as editing an XML file or creating a new html page within a CMS. And to nip this in the bud dont give me you should be using databases for info, not writing files. That has its place too, Im asking a emdifferentem question though, about writing files, because sometimes you need to do that too Pp  p3 I get that there are situations where you simply wont be able to write the file. But what Im asking is if anyone has experience with emminimizingem that so that it works in as many situations as possible. I know what I have above isnt the most universal snippet humanly possible, so Im asking what might be p

Negative 1012 pPreface I write iPad apps for a museum to be used as permanant informational kiosks. They need to run 1 app all the time. My question pertains to this situation and not App Store distribution or worrying about outofhouse users as these are enterprise apps. I am the only developer and am still new to app development, operate under strict deadlines and cant always fix every bug before the app has to go on the floor. Our guests are sometimes the apps intial testers. These are iPad 2s and news running iOS 5.1. Some apps are running the Cocos2d ver 2.0 framework.p  pI need to prevent museum guests from even getting to the iPads desktop. I have disabled the home button using a mobileconfig file after finding out about codeSBStoreDemoAppLockcode and with a metal frame enclosure. Obviously I want, and work towards, my apps never crashing. However, when the iPads are running 247 and sometimes deal with 2000 children tapping, swiping, and beating on them per day, the app does occasionally crash.p  pAs I work on better coding to prevent crashes from even happening, is there any way to prevent an app from fully closing if it experiences a crash Meaning if it needs to crash, can a simple imageView be displayed saying contact IT I know that sounds contradictory, because if an app needs to crash, its going to crash, but Im not sure how else to word it. p  pAlternatively, and even less likely, is there a way to relaunch the app automagically after a crash Ive looked into the URL scheme approach and adding that to codeapplicationWillTerminatecode, however that has been deprecated since iOS 4 came on the scene. I prefer to avoid jailbreaking, but if someone knows a dead easy way to do this with a Cydia app, Id like to hear about it as a last resort option. p  pI have the iPads fully restricted as far as is available under the settings tab, but kids and adults today can find all sorts of things to mess up, such as inverting colors, turning on assisted zoom, etc.  p

Negative 1012 pI suspect many have had this case  you present modal view controller, which then present navigation view controller, that has many table view controllers pushing onto the stack. Basically, pushing and presenting controllers. When you get to last you have to dismiss them all, and return to root view controllerp  pDo i have to call for every modal controller dismiss, and for every pushed controller pop, or is there a better way to do thisp  pI am using iOS5 storyboards if that is relevant somehow.p  pEDIT Thanks for answes but its little more complicated than that  basically i present modal view controller from root controller, than push couple of controllers, then present one more modal view. At that time I want to go to root controller. So just poping view controllers want do it, some of them have to be dissmisedp

Negative 1012 pDoes jQuery Mobile even support ajax form submits  This probably sounds like a ridiculous question, but after fighting with it for hours, and then checking the jquerymobile.com docs, Im starting to think that it doesntp  pIll skip my own code, and go right to jquerymobile.com.p  pa hrefhttpjquerymobile.comtestdocsformsformssample.html relnofollowhttpjquerymobile.comtestdocsformsformssample.htmlap  pThis page has a section called Default Ajax form example wherein the author very briefly tells us how jQuery mobile handles ajax form submission.  In hisher words, jQuery Mobile will make sure that the Url specified is able to be retrieved via Ajax, and handle it appropriately.  Obviously, lots of detail there.  And ironically, the sample provided does NOT call results ajaxily.  It merely redirects to the results php script.  No ajax is performed.  The form is a standard html form with an action and method.  It looks like should behave exactly as it does, redirecting to a new location.  Somehow JQM is supposed to jump in and set up ajax automatically but it doesnt do that on my iPhone, or in Safari, Firefox, or Chrome.p  pAm I going crazy, or is JQM simply incomplete, and advertising this functionality falselyp

To keep this working inventory as accurate as I can and not based on a variable, I would like to reset column B everyday. That way, if a count is off slightly, I dont have to reset everything. p  pI have been working on this for awhile and I know there is a better way to do this than the five I have tried and failed at. It needs to be column based though, my sheet has 465 rows that this needs to apply to and as businesses grow, so will the rows on this sheet.p  pThe code that got me the closest is thisp  precodeSub CommandButton1Click      ColumnsCC.Select     Selection.Copy     ColumnsBB.Select     Selection.PasteSpecial PastexlPasteValues, OperationxlNone, SkipBlanks          False, TransposeFalse      Dim r As Long     For r  CellsRows.Count, 2.EndxlUp.Row To 1 Step 1         If Cellsr, 2  na Then Cellsr, 2.value  0     Next r  End Sub codepre  pThe major problem I have is every time I run the code it ups the count on some of my other products.  If you look at the bike frame, you can sell it separately but you also get a bike handle when you do.  When this code resets it always adds the bike handles.  If I run it 10 times without changes my inventory grows higher then excel is willing to show. Any idea how I can fix this or any ideas of a different way all togetherp

Negative 1012 pstrongNotestrong While the two answers provided so far on September 6th are interesting, they unfortunately dont address the question. p  pOne of my Android test devices is a HTC One X. This device is known for frequently killing background applications even including the launcher, most infuriatingly because it tends to live on the edge in terms of RAM allocation, presumably due to HTC bloatware. However, for my purposes, this has been extremely useful as it has helped to highlight the effects of various low memory situations and allow me to improve my application to cope with such events. One of the things I have learnt, for instance, is that the codeApplicationcode instance and other codestaticcode resources can be killed even though the codeActivitycode backstack is retained. So, to give a good user experience, the backstack can remain even though the single process running the application, and all the codestaticcodes it holds, has gone. For this reason, my application is now very rugged in terms of gracefully checking the state, and actioning the reinitialization if necessary, of the Singleton data it needs on the resuming of any codeActivitycode.  p  pTo move onto my specific question, I have been seeing a rare symptom that, through code inspection, I believe could only have been caused by a codestaticcode member of one class having been killed and then subsequently reinitialized, while another static resource in one of my library classes has emnotem been reinitialized. I appreciate that such a dependency between two separate codestaticcode resources represents bad design on my part, and I will refactor to avoid this. However, I would like to know if I could possibly be correct in my analysis  that is, is it possible to have a sitation where the backstack is retained, but only emsomeem codestaticcode resources are killed, particularly on a perlibrary  package basisp  pstrongEdit 1strong Ill give a bit more information about the two classes concerned. p  pClass 1 is a class well call codeControllercode. Its emnotem used as a Singleton, but contains a codestaticcode codeMapcode of data to be common across all instances. Its initialised like sop  precodeprivate static MapltString, Stringgt sSomeMetaData  static      sSomeMetaData  new HashMapltString, Stringgt  codepre  pNext, I have a class called codeMyFlyweightFactorycode. This class lives in a emseparate libraryem. This class is a Singletonp  precodeprivate static MyFlyweightFactory instance  new MyFlyweightFactory  public static synchronized MyFlyweightFactory getInstance     return instance      private MyFlyweightFactory   TreeMapltString, MyParserRenderergt images  new TreeMapltString, MyParserRenderergt  codepre  pNow, here is the dependency. The factory class has a getter method to obtain a certain named image object which is constructed by parsing a file from the file system. If the factory hasnt been asked for that image since factory initialization, it parses it from an file its actually an SVG image parser library of mine. The image is parsed into a codeMyParserRenderercode object. When this image parsing happens, the factory also populates some data in the codeControllercode class codesSomeMetaDatacode member. All of the images that the factory holds onto are kept in the codeimagescode member codeTreeMapcode you see above. So, these images are a nonstatic member of a codestaticcode Singleton factory instance. p  pThe rare problem situation seems to be that instances of codeControllercode find that codesSomeMetaDatacode is empty, even though I know that codeMyFlyweightFactorycode has provided some objects from its codeMapcode. This could surely only happen, I believe, if the intance of codeMyFlyweightFactorycode has stayed around and therefore didnt need to reparse the image objects which means that it will emnotem populate codesSomeMetaDatacode ever again, but in the meantime the codestaticcode initializer of codeControllercode has since executed again. I can confirm that codesSomeMetaDatacode is emnotem being codeclearcodeed anywhere else in code. p

Negative 1012 pI built a database of MYSQL in windows environment, I found a lot examples C API for MYSQL in visual studio environment. But I am not sure that if I write a program to test the C API by using gcc or other tools in LINUX environment just compile and run the program, without the platform like codeeclipsecode. Because in visual studio, I need to add some lib and dll for MYSQL. Shall I need to write a configuration file How can I do this, thanks a lotp  pI want to make it more clear. The database is built in WINDOWS, I want to run my cprogram in Linux. So how to compile them with some lib required by MYSQL. And is there something different when I am not in visual studio p

Negative 1012 pI have a UITableView driven by a NSFetchedResultsController.  The tableview has a custom footer view, and Im using RestKit to fetch data from an api and map the response into Core Data.p  pAfter a RestKit request returns, Im experiencing a very odd behavior where the response is mapped into core data, my FetchedResultsController sends its delegate my tableview controller updates, and the tableview is partially updated, all in less than 1 second.  Then, several seconds later, the tableview finishes updating.  I say the tableview is partially updated because at first, the tablefooterview is not redrawn, and cells are added below it.  Its not until after the delay that the footer moves into place.p  pIve tried profiling the app with instruments, and this doesnt seem to be a CPU based delay in drawingloading cells. Ive also tried simply setting the title label of the cell only when configuring cells to minimize complexity.  I also see the same behavior both on the device and the simulator.p  pId really like to track down and eliminate this delay, as it really causes a bad user experience.p  pAn except from the logsp

Negative 1012 pIve seen the solution to a hrefhttparshaw.comjsfullcalendar1.5.4demosexternaldragging.html relnofollowdrag and drop external events in fullcalendara. But, in this demo, all the external events have a duration of 2 hours because defaultEventMinutes parameter is set to 120. Im trying to change this demo in order to manage events with different durations. Say, My event 1 is 45min long, My event 2 is 165min, etc.p  pAt the beginning I though there may be an attribute to store the duration in the eventObject, but according to the documentation, its not the case. Then, I thought it would be possible to change the value of defaultEventMinutes when starting dragging the event. But apparently, I cant do it without rebuilding the whole calendar.p  pAccording to you, what is the best means to meet this requirement Thanks in advance for your advice...p

Negative 1012 pto check the divisibility of an integer say A by another integersay B , i have tried an approach by factoring B and checking if A is divisible by all the prime factors of B . However im not sure if its correct  Could you please suggest what can be done  For e.g if we have a very large integer say 10100 and we want to check if its divisible by another integer say 200 then i was trying if 10100 is divisible by 2 and 5 by noticing the last digit.  If A is small enough we could directly have checked if AB0 but i was trying this for larger numbers. Thanks,p

Negative 1012 pSpring 2.5, Hibernate.p  pOur application is architected to have a services layer and a manager layer. The services layer provides all read only services and communicates to the UI the results. For services requiring changes to the database, the services layer performs all initial readonly functions, then calls the manager layer.p  pWe have set up a transaction advice around our manager layer to catch all exceptions coming out of the manager layer and rollback those transactions. This works pretty well for the most part.p  pThe problem is in situations where we have one manager call another manager to perform some functionality. This functionality throws an exception, which is a real exception when called from the UI, but is handled internally in the client manager and a successful result is returned.

Negative 1012 pI am trying to follow a hrefhttpbartoszmilewski.com20081201catomicsandmemoryordering relnofollowthis articlea in the section about publication safety. My case is no different than the trivial example in the article, but the published data is not a single value, but several fields in a codestructcode. The publisher will write each field singularly, so by wrapping up each write with a store with codememoryorderreleasecode I should be ok.p  pThe consumer will first check with codememoryorderacquirecode that the data is ready. Then, Im tempted to use a codememcpycode to copy the entire published codestructcode somewhere else because that fits better into the rest of the preexisting code, but this doesnt seem to be safe because I cannot specify the memory model.

Negative 1012 pI have solution split into 2 projectsp  ul liThe emindependentem project contains interface codeExampleInfcode and declares some services needed for the application. Those services are provided by the third party API a hrefhttphadoop.apache.org relnofollowHadoopa client API. This project contains GUI components and other application logic but does not link third party libraries that provide services declared by codeExampleInfcode. There is no class implementing codeExampleInfcode in this project.li liThe emdependentem project that contains links to third party libraries. This project contains class codeExampleImplcode that encapsulates third party API and implements codeExampleInfcode.li ul  pIn the emindependentem project there is class lets call it class codeAcode that consumes uses services declared by codeExampleInfcode. Because the emindependentem does not link the emdependentem project, in order to use codeExampleInfcode it needs to load its implementation codeExampleImplcode dynamically in runtime. Also it needs to dynamically load all the third party libraries required by codeExampleImplcode.p  pCurrently this is done by a bunch of constants codepublic static final Stringcode attributes that contain paths to emdependentem project where dynamically loaded resources are located and a lot of messy codeClassLoadercode code. I do not consider this to be a good solution. Is there any pattern, best practice or common way how this can be done What would you recommend in your experiencep  pThis pattern reminds me a bit of dependency injection in Java EE. At least I think it is good idea to externalize the locations of classes and libraries .jars that need to be loaded dynamically to XML and then load them all in cycle instead of calling codeClassLoader.loadClasscode separately for each constant. Is there any nice clean way how to load XML in the same package and load classes and jars specified by that XML Code example would be much appreciated.   p

Negative 1012 pI am working on a portion of an app that requires a Photos type presentation of multiple thumbnail images.  The full size images are quite large, and generating the thumbnails every time is taking too long, so I am going to cache the thumbnails.p  pI am having a hard time determining how best to store the thumbnails on the filesystem once I create them.  I can think of a few possibilities but I dont like any of themp  ul liSave the thumbnail in the same directory as the original file, with Thumb added to the filename image.png and imageThumb.png.  This makes for a messy directory and I would think performance would become a problem because of reading so many different files to load at once.li liSave the thumbnails in their own subdirectory, with the same filename as the original.  I think that this is slightly cleaner, but Im still opening lots of different files.li liSave all of the thumbnails to a Thumbnails file.  I think that this is commonly done in Windows and OS X  I like the idea because I can open one file and read multiple thumbnails from it, but Im not sure how to store all of them in the same file and associate them with the original files.  strongEDITstrong I thought of using codeNSKeyedArchiverunArchivercode but from what I can find, anytime a thumbnail is addedremoved, I would have to recreate the entire archive.

Negative 1012 pI have finally finished the app that I was working on.  It is a scoreboard app for basketball.  It works exactly as expected but during the development phase I have hardcoded all of the variables in.  This is fine for me but if this app is useful for anyone else then some of the variables need to be able to be changed.p  pI figured the best way to do this is with the us of the Options Menu.  Ive got the menu appearing on the screen when the user clicks on the Settings option in the menu.  I created a new Activity called SettingsActivity and was able to show this XML layout by using the startActivityR.layout.settings method.  But when I click the BACK button on my device it exits the program.p  pIm curious of a couple of things... My understanding is that if I use the startActivity method that it will essentially erase my current Activity and go to the new one.  However, in the unlikely situation a user does this in the middle of the game, I dont what it wiping everything out.  I need it to just continue where it left off from when the user hits the BACK button.p  pHow should I go about accomplishing thisp

I also read this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4607425dependencyinjectionwithninjectmvc3andusingtheservicelocatorpatternDependency Injection with Ninject, MVC 3 and using the Service Locator Patterna which discusses the issue as well.p  pHowever, my question concerns this particular casep  precodepublic class MyController      public void GetData              using var repository  new Repository                       Use the repository which disposes of an Entity Framework              data context at the end of its life.                     Lots of other methods.  codepre  pHere I have a controller which contains a method that calls a repository which automatically instantiates an internal Entity Framework data context. This single data context is used, because the context is called by every method in the repository so it seems to make sense to share a single context for the entire lifetime of the repository object.p  pNow, as the controller class is large, there is a greater chance than not that this given repository will not be used. As I assume perhaps incorrectly that this instantiating a DC is an expensive operation, I would prefer to avoid doing so. Using the service locator pattern allows me to defer instantiation until the context is actually needed, but given the valid arguments against it in the above links, I would prefer to avoid it.p  pSo what I would like to know is if there is a more efficient way of using dependency injection in the above case that would prevent me from instantiating my repository and underlying data context unnecessarily.p

Currently, I have a set of URLs that are set up as domain.comscript.phpa1p  pWhile I know how to change those URLs to domain.coma this doesnt quite help me with this one because variable A is just a numerical identifier, so going from domain.comscript.phpproducts1 to domain.com1 doesnt do me a lot of good.p  pInstead, its variable B which is actually the descriptor, ProductName. So what Im trying to do is have it so that rather than domain.coma, I can get domain.comb. There is a complication. The reason that the original set up used variable A is that multiple products use the same descriptor in variable B, so I also need to include variable C which differentiates them, so I need the URL to be domain.combc.p  pBonus Remember how I said I had another script that Id changed from domain.comscript2.phpd1 to domain.comd Well, itd be super awesome if I could set up my this current script to display not as domain.combc but instead as domain.comdbc because domaind is actually the search page for this other script, so its a really logical flow and would really simplify browsing, and would let users intuitively move between the search and the products without much work.p  pI have no idea if this is even possible, but any help would be appreciated.p

This does not only evaluate the value given to the left, but it can also be used for comparing anything. Alright enough talk about javascript. The thing is, I am a litle bit unexperienced in c, but actually, I wanted to write a function, that takes a string as an input, searches for the word sectionboth caps and mixtured and does something when it sees it.

One of the solutions I thought about was, in pseudocodep  precodeif CertainCoordinate  red pixel     return A codepre  pWhereas CertainCoordinate Could be the unchangeable coordinates x and y of A, B,C and D Then I would use 4 ifs, but I dont really know how to implement even that.

So for instance, in the first image I would like it to open a MessageBox and say Hey user I found the exit, its D, instead of showing me the image with the red path on it. The problem is, I dont know how to teach MatLab where is D and to make him recognize that he found D. So, are there any suggestions on how to do thatp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1012 pFrom an answer in a previous question, given by codeHans Passantcode I understood that p  precode MyImage  new BitmapopenFileDialog1.FileName  pictureBox1.Image  ImageMyImage codepre  blockquote   pYes, that code puts a lock on the file. The lock is produced by a   memory mapped file object that GDI creates to efficiently map the   pixel data of the file into memory without having to allocate space in   the paging file. You will not be able to delete the file as long as   the image is displayed in the picture box and not disposed, the lock   prevents that.p blockquote  pThe question was about an errorsometimes when I tried to delete a previously used image from the codePictureBoxcode. It seems that in this exact situation even callingp  precodeif MyImage  null      MyImage.Dispose  codepre  pdoesnt guarantee that when the time comes to delete the imagei guess this could be any kind of unmanaged resource it will be disposed.p  pSo I have two questions  the first is related to my current problem with using codeBitMapcode in the codePictureBoxcode and the locking of the resource caused by that. I saw that this is not the only way to show an image inside the codePictureBoxcode so is there another way which wont cause this problem and will guarantee that the image is released to be deleted anytime I need to.p  pAnd my second question  what is the basic approach when I have to work with unmanaged resources in .NET and I need to do operations like codeDeletecode with them. I guess this problem may come up when working with any kind of unmanaged resource in .NET, is there a common approach to solve the problem with the lockingreleasing the resource in a certain moment and not relaying on the codeGarbage Collectorcode which obviously will fail you from time to time since it may take different time for releasing. I saw that some use codeGC...code methods to call explicitly codefinilizercode and stuff like that but a college mention that its better to not use those methods since they may cause unpredictable problems.p  pSo any guidelines, suggestionsp

Negative 1012 pUsing the App Engine Trusted Tester Sockets to connect to APNS. Writing to socket works fine.p  pBut the problem is that the Socket gets reclaimed after 2 minutes of inactivity. It says in the Trusted Tester Website that any socket operation keeps the socket alive for further 2 minutes. It is nicer to keep the socket open until APNS decides to close the connection.p  pAfter trying pretty much all of the Socket API methods short of writing to the Output Stream, Socket gets closed after 2 minutes no matter what.

Negative 1012 pIm writing some Clojure code using Enlive to process a set of XML documents. Theyre in an XML format that borrows heavily from HTML but adds some custom tags, and my job is to convert them to real HTML. The custom tag thats bothering me the most right now is codelttabgtcode, which is being used in all kinds of places it shouldnt be. For example, its often used to make lists which should really have been made with codeltolgtcode and codeltligtcode. Heres an example of the kind of thing Im encounteringp  precodeltp classNormalgtSome textltpgt ltp classListWithTabsgtalttab gtFirst list itemltpgt ltp classListWithTabsgtblttab gtSecond list itemltpgt ltp classListWithTabsgtclttab gtThird list itemltpgt ltp classNormalgtSome more textltpgt ltp classAnotherListgt1.lttab gtAnother listltpgt ltp classAnotherListgt2.lttab gtTwo items this timeltpgt ltp classNormalgtSome final textltpgt codepre  pI want to turn this intop  precodeltp classNormalgtSome textltpgt ltol typeagt ltli classListWithTabsgtFirst list itemltligt ltli classListWithTabsgtSecond list itemltligt ltli classListWithTabsgtThird list itemltligt ltolgt ltp classNormalgtSome more textltpgt ltol type1gt ltli classAnotherListgtAnother listltligt ltli classAnotherListgtTwo items this timeltligt ltolgt ltp classNormalgtSome final textltpgt codepre  pTo do this, I need to get the codeltpgtcode elements that contain codelttabgtcode descendants easy with Enlive selectors, and somehow cluster them according to the natural groupings they had in the original XML documents much harder.p  pIve looked through the documents and determined that I cant rely on the codeclasscode attribute sometimes these codeltpgtcodethatshouldbecodeltligtcode elements have the same class as the codeltpgtcode elements around them, and sometimes there are two successive groups of codeltpgtcodethatshouldbecodeltligtcode elements with the same class as each other i.e., as if the example I posted had both clusters having the class codeListWithTabscode. The one thing I think I can rely on is that there are never two different lists without at least one nonlist element separating them in other words, any cluster of successive codeltpgtcode elements which all have the property has at least one codelttabgtcode element as a descendant are all part of the same list.p  pWith that in mind, I did some experimenting at the REPL, with Enlive loaded under the namespace codeecode that is, coderequire [net.cgrand.enlivehtml as e]code should be assumed to be in effect for all the rest of my question. It was easy to write a selector to pick out the elements I want, but codeeselect snippet [ehas [tab]]code returns a list well, its really a lazy sequence of 5 elements. But what I want is a list of lists the first with three elements and the second with two. Something vaguely like this pardon the nonstandard indentationp  precode[   [tag p, content ... First list item ...    tag p, content ... Second list item ...    tag p, content ... Third list item ...   ]  3 items in first list   [tag p, content ... Another list ...    tag p, content ... With just two items ...   ]  2 items in second list ] codepre  pI was able to create the following selectorsp  precodedef firstoftabgroup [ehas [tab]                          eleft complement ehas [tab]] def restoftabgroup [ehas [tab]                         eleft ehas [tab]] codepre  pBut now Im stuck. Id like to do something like codeeselect snippet [[estartat firstoftabgroup etakewhile restoftabgroup]]code, but as far as I know Enlive doesnt have any functions like codestartatcode and codetakewhilecode.p  pIt feels like Im very close, but just missing one final key step. So how do I take the last step How do I select just a cluster of elements that match certain rules, but omit other elements that would match the same rules but arent part of that first clusterp

Then , i need my PHP server , to look in the database in which events this emidem is subscribed to and return the events.p  pSo i need to make a GET request , where i send as parameter the emidem and i get back a json file with the events.

But how do i return it to my htmljquery page thoughp  pOr should the GET request target only XMLJSON files The way i see what i described till now is that my jquery makes a POST request to my server with the id and the server makes a POST request to my web page with the events. Is not exactly a GET ...p

Negative 1012 pI have been using the below Google Maps script without problems. However, after adding Jquery Mobile to the page the map wont show when I access the page through a link. If I reload the page the map shows. Searching for a solution I have found that it probably is a problem with the script not initializing but I have not been able to implement any suggested solution.

Negative 1012 pThe point of all this is to run a separate Thread  can be something similar Task, Action  and to log the start and the end, preferably minimizing code impact changes and logging being strongtransparent to the code, just using a different classstrong.p  pRecently I decided to inherit from class codeSystem.Threading.Threadcode as a way to implement logging for things like Thread x started. and Thread x ended. to a file, for debugging. Since the class is sealed I used composition to add the Thread as a member and call respective function, accessors and all necessary. I had a simplistic idea of how to do it so I thought something likep  precodenamespace MyNamespace      class Thread              private System.Threading.Thread thread          wrap constructor properties methods...         ...          public void Start                          logthread.name   start.                 thread.Start                 logthread.name   end.                   ...       codepre  pNow after all this trouble of wrapping existing functionality and using the new namespace instead of System.Threading... this turned out to be bad since this call if Im not mistaking is from the strongcallingstrong Thread and second the end does not log. The logging is mainly for debugging and having a nonvolatile state of what happened.p  pEDITp  pHeres a simplified code using Ahmeds answer, which is good, and still ongoing issue is that if the codeSimulatedThreadcode throws an exception the Ending... doesnt log for either MainThread or CustomThread. If the CustomThread abnormally terminates, Ending... for MainThread and CustomThread should be recorded.  The exception handling is not relevant .

So therefore I wont be able to cache the Images in the browser which would have been a good choice. Is there anyway to do still in javascript I cant have the validity of those urls for longer due to security issues. And secondly within that time frame if someone got hold of that url he can view the file without running through authentication from the app.li liOther option is to serve the file from my express app itself after streaming it from S3 servers. This allows me to have http cache headers, therefore enable browser caching. It also makes sure no can view a file without being authenticated. Ideally I would like to stream the file and a I am hosting using NGINX proxy relay the other side streaming to NGINX. But as i see that can only be posible if the file exist in the same systems files. But here I have to stream it and return when i get the stream is complete. Dont want to store the files locally.li ul  pI am not able to evaluate which of the two options would be a better choice I want to redirect as much work as possible to S3 or cloudfront but even using singed urls also makes the request first to my servers. I also want caching features. p  pSo what would be ideal way to do with the answers for the particular questions pertaining to those methodsp

Negative 1012 pSo, Im trying to implement Lua as a scripting language in C. Its simple enough, really, if you use it as part of a console application. But I want to be able to create a game console within XNA. The problem is that Lua.DoString seems to return a console line, rather than a string  which, as I said, is fine for console applications, but I want to add it to an output buffer as a string so I can display it ingame, rather than in a console window. I apologize if this is confusing  hopefully the code will clear it up.p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using LuaInterface  namespace LuaConsoleLibrary      public class LuaConsole              private Lua lua          private bool isRunning  true         private string input         private Listltstringgt outputBuffer          public bool IsRunning                      get  return isRunning                    public LuaConsole                      this.lua  lua                   public void Run                      int i  0             whileisRunning                              outputBuffer.Addgt                   input  Console.ReadLine                 outputBuffer.Add                  try                                      lua.DoStringinput                                  catchException e                                      outputBuffer.Adde.Message                                  finally                                      outputBuffer.Add                                              codepre  pBasically, Im confused as to why codelua.DoStringinputcode should work as opposed to having to use codeConsole.WriteLinelua.DoStringinputcode. Ive even tried codeoutputBuffer.Addlua.DoStringinput.ToStringcode, which, being that ToString is valid there, should work in theory. Instead it performs codelua.DoStringcode and then throws an exception  Object reference not set to an instance of an object. Unless Im mistaken, the object in question is codeLuacode, which makes codeluacode a valid object reference. Anyway, seeing as these two solutions dont work, I was wondering if anyone knows enough about LuaInterface to suggest an alternative way to get the same result. I essentially want something to the effect of codeoutputBuffer.Addlua.DoStringinputcode. By the way, the Lua command Ive been using to test this is codeprinttestcode  maybe codeprintcode is somehow returning a console line instead of a string, but I cant think of another way to return a string from Lua.p  pI apologize if my problem is rambling or poorly explained  I tried to be as concise as possible, but its kind of a niche issue and I dont know how else to explain it, really. Oh, and I did try Google, and I browsed all 65 or so LuaInterface questions on Stack Overflow, so Im 95 sure Ive done my due diligence before asking this question. LuaInterface is just not that wellknown of a tool, I guess.p

Negative 1012 pHeres my situation, I have a web site that I just load using Apache HTTPD that then makes Ajax POST requests to a servlet which returns only JSON data. That JSON data is then used to update tables, etc..p  pNow I want to add user logic to my site, and also maintain servlet sessions for requests made by individual users.p  pI understand that the servlet needs to return the session id generated by the first call to request.getSession, so that the client can add this sessionid to future Ajax requests in order for the servlet to know which session in memory to use.p  pI also understand that the two ways that this session id can be returned to the client is either using cookies JESSIONID or URL Rewriting.p  pIf I cant use URL Rewriting, because Im just returning JSON data, are cookies the only way I have left to send back the session id to the clientp  pAlso, as a side question, currently I noticed that there is no JSESSIONID cookie in any of my HTTP responses from the servlet. Someone suggested to me that this was something new in Tomcat7 and that I had to activate them in the global context.xml.

Negative 1012 pI am pulling a list of invoices filtered by a starting and ending date, and further filtered by type of invoice from a SQL table. When I specify a range of 20130701 through 20130930 I am receiving 2 invoices per company when I expect 3. When I use the built in select top 1000 query in SSMS and add my date filters, all the expected invoices appear.p  pHere is my fancy query that Im using that utilizing variables that are fed inp  precodeDECLARE ReportStart datetime DECLARE ReportStop datetime  SET ReportStart  20130701 SET ReportStop  20130930  SELECT EntityCompany.CompanyName, ReportingAgreementTypes.Description, ReportingInvoices.InvoiceAmount, ISNULLReportingProductCost.ProductCost,0, ReportingInvoices.InvoiceAmount  ISNULLReportingProductCost.ProductCost,0, ReportingAgreementTypes.Description  EntityCompany.CompanyName, ReportingInvoices.InvoiceDate FROM ReportingInvoices JOIN EntityCompany ON EntityCompany.ClientID  ReportingInvoices.ClientID LEFT JOIN ReportingProductCost ON ReportingProductCost.InvoiceNumber ReportingInvoices.InvoiceNumber JOIN ReportingAgreementTypes ON ReportingAgreementTypes.AgreementTypeID  ReportingInvoices.AgreementTypeID WHERE ReportingInvoices.AgreementTypeID  SELECT AgreementTypeID FROM ReportingAgreementTypes WHERE Description  Resold Services AND ReportingInvoices.InvoiceDate gt ReportStart AND ReportingInvoices.InvoiceDate lt ReportStop  ORDER BY CompanyName,InvoiceDate codepre  pThe above only returns 2 invoices per company.

Still only get 2 invoices instead of the expected 3. Ive also tried manually entering the dates instead of the  variables, same result. I confirmed that InvoiceDate is defined as a datetime in the table. Ive tried making all JOINs a FULL JOIN to see if anything is hiding, but no change. Here is how I stripped down the original query to keep all other tables out of the mix and yet Im still getting only 2 invoices per client ID instead of 3 I manually entered the ID for the type filterp  precodeDECLARE ReportStart datetime DECLARE ReportStop datetime  SET ReportStart  20130701 SET ReportStop  20130930  SELECT EntityCompany.CompanyName, ReportingAgreementTypes.Description, ReportingInvoices.ClientID, ReportingInvoices.InvoiceAmount, ISNULLReportingProductCost.ProductCost,0, ReportingInvoices.InvoiceAmount  ISNULLReportingProductCost.ProductCost,0, ReportingAgreementTypes.Description  EntityCompany.CompanyName, ReportingInvoices.InvoiceDate FROM ReportingInvoices JOIN EntityCompany ON EntityCompany.ClientID  ReportingInvoices.ClientID LEFT JOIN ReportingProductCost ON ReportingProductCost.InvoiceNumber  ReportingInvoices.InvoiceNumber JOIN ReportingAgreementTypes ON ReportingAgreementTypes.AgreementTypeID  ReportingInvoices.AgreementTypeID WHERE ReportingInvoices.AgreementTypeID  22 SELECT AgreementTypeID FROM ReportingAgreementTypes WHERE Description  Resold Services AND ReportingInvoices.InvoiceDate gt 20130701 AND ReportingInvoices.InvoiceDate lt 20130930  ORDER BY ClientID,InvoiceDate codepre  pThis strikes me as really weird as it is pretty much the same query as the SSMS generated one that returns correct results.

Negative 1012 pRecently I was asked in an interview to convert the string aabbbccccddddd to a2b3c4d5. The goal is to replace each repeated character with a single occurrence and a repeat count.

Also I need to write a function to reverse the format back to the original one eme.g.em from the string a2b3c4d5 to aabbbccccddddd. I was free to use either C or C. I wrote the below code, but the interviewer seemed to be not very happy with this. He asked me to try a smarter way than this.p  pIn the below code, I used codeformatstringcode to eliminate repeated chars by just adding the repeated count and used codereverseformatstringcode to convert back to the original string.p  precodevoid formatstringchar target, const char source    int charRepeatCount  1   bool isFirstChar  true   while source  0      if isFirstChar         Always add the first character to the target       isFirstChar  false       target  source       source target      else         Compare the current char with previous one,        increment repeat count       if source  source1          charRepeatCount         source        else          if charRepeatCount gt 1             Convert repeat count to string, append to the target           char repeatStr[10]           snprintfrepeatStr, 10, i, charRepeatCount           int repeatCount  strlenrepeatStr           for int i  0 i lt repeatCount i              target  repeatStr[i]             target                      charRepeatCount  1  Reset repeat count                  target  source         source target                  if charRepeatCount gt 1       Convert repeat count to string, append it to the target     char repeatStr[10]     snprintfrepeatStr, 10, i, charRepeatCount     int repeatCount  strlenrepeatStr     for int i  0 i lt repeatCount i        target  repeatStr[i]       target           target  0   void reverseformatstringchar target, const char source    int charRepeatCount  0   bool isFirstChar  true   while source  0      if isFirstChar         Always add the first character to the target       isFirstChar  false       target  source       source target      else         If current char is alpha, add it to the target       if isalphasource          target  source         target source        else           Get repeat count of previous character         while isdigitsource            int currentDigit  source  0           charRepeatCount  charRepeatCount  0                currentDigit  charRepeatCount  10  currentDigit           source                   Decrement repeat count as we have already written          the first unique char to the target         charRepeatCount           Repeat the last char for this count         while charRepeatCount gt 0            target  target  1           target           charRepeatCount                           target  0  codepre  pI didnt find any issues with above code.

Negative 1012 pGiven a cloud storage folder with say 1PB of data in it, what would be the quickest way to sort all of that data Its easy to sort small chunks of it, but then merging them into a larger sorted output will take longer since at some point a single process will have to merge the whole thing. I would like to avoid this, and have a fully distributed solution, is there a way If so, is there any implementation that would be suitable for using to sort data in S3p

Negative 1012 pIm developing a game on iOS and Android in C using cocos2dx. I have a function that implements the A pathfinding algorithm. I have developed and tested this on iOS and it works flawlessly. On Android, however, this function causes a crash. How is it possible that the same C logic will run smoothly on the one device, but not on the otherp  pUnfortunately the function is a rather large one, but Ill post it anyway. If its too long to read through, Ill be happy with some general pointers regarding the sort of pitfalls that may cause a crash on one device device but not the other. Heres what I think is happening. A pathStep struct which contains a few ints, and also has a pathStep pointer to its parent the previous step for the initial step is created. Its index is set to equal the start index, and its address is added to the open list. Somehow, though, when its retrieved from the open list at the beginning of the loop, its index has changed from whatever it was set to to 0.p  pHeres the functionp  precodestdvectorltpathStepgt

Negative 1012 pMy question is more focused on a navigation stack scenario... I have a, lets say, main view with several table cells. Each of the cells navigates to a new view, by pushing it to the navigation stack, whose view controller stores data and subviews in several codeNSMutableArraycode and codeNSArraycode. The common flow for the app is going back and forth from the main view controller to another of the view controllers, a common scenario. Ill appreciate some recommendations regarding memory management operations Id perform in such scenario, taking into account that Im under ARCp  pa Which cleaning staff should I perform Is it recommendable to clean the arrays whenever the views disappear, or would it be better to keep them in case the user navigates again to the viewp  pb Regarding the views and subviews, should I also nilify them when the view disappears All of them, including those defined in the codenibcode file, or only those I create in codep  pThanks p

Negative 1012 pI need to add Application Feedback functionality to all of our existing web applications ASP.NET.  The purpose of this is for the user to be able to click Give Feedback to give feedback regarding the app theyre using.  Say they want to submit a suggestion for an enhancement, report a bug, etc.  Theyll click this link.  p  pSo, with these requirements in mind, I think the easiest, most simplest solution, considering that this functionality will have to be added to all existing web apps, will be to create a separate application, called something like AppFeedback.  This will be a single page, ASP.NET app.  The hyperlink that will be tied to Give Feedback will be the URL for this new AppFeedback app.  The hyperlink will open in a new window a small, resized popup.  The URL will contain query string parameters for appName and userId.  So, something like codehttpserverAppFeedbackappNamemyAppNameampuserIdmikecode.  When the user is on this popup window, they will provide feedback in the feedback text box and click Submit.  Clicking Submit will save the feedback data to a common Feedback database  it will insert the Feedback comment, the apps name from the query string, and the current user Id.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrong Do you recommend a different approach  Im not entirely confident in this approach as Ive never done something like this before.  Is there anything about this approach that concerns you  This is not an opinion based question, Im soliciting feedback as to whether this approach is decent, given common best practices.p
Negative 1012 pIm trying to reskin an existing site using CSS only.  I will be taking one of their CSS files and redoing it to match a new design, without changing any HTML.  I want a good way of continually updating and then testing, but I have to do it locally because they do not have a dev environment.  The site itself is dynamic and authenticated, so I cant just download pages from the site and test the entire thing locally.  I was hoping that there is a way to tell my browser Firefox, preferably to disable that specific remote CSS file and replace it with a local file.  p  pI dont want to use something like Web Develop Toolbar or Firebug because that requires me to manually make the changes each time I load a page.  I want something more seamless.p  pI was thinking one possibility is to load my new stylesheet in userContent.css, but I would still need a way of telling the browser not to load the original stylesheet from the server.p  pAny ideasp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I found this Mozilla bug report a hrefhttpsbugzilla.mozilla.orgshowbug.cgiid208641 relnofollowhttpsbugzilla.mozilla.orgshowbug.cgiid208641a discussing the issue of being able to change userContent.css without restarting Firefox.  One of the posters Simon Wilper posted some files and info about adding a menu item to refresh userContent.css, but it talks about modifying browser.xul and I cant find that file on my system.  This seems like the last piece of the puzzle.p

Here is an example of how I have the code setupp  precodepublic async TaskltActionResultgt Indexint[] ids      Listltintgt listOfDataPoints  dataPointServiceids     ListltTaskgt dpTaskList  new ListltTaskgt     foreach var x in listOfDataPoints              dpTaskList.AddCAsyncx           await Task.WhenAlldpTaskList     return View    private async Task CAsyncint id      this method executes very fast     var idTemp  paddIDid     await DAsyncidTemp   private async Task DAsyncstring id      this method executes very fast     await EAsyncid   private async Task EAsyncstring url      this method performs the actual async IO     result  await new WebClient.DownloadStringTaskAsyncnew Uriurl     saveContentresult  codepre  pAs you can see the controller calls CAsyncx asynchronously then there is a chain of async methods to EAsync. There are methods between the controller and EAsync and all have the async modifier. Is there a performance penalty since there are methods using the async modifyer but not doing any async IO workp  pstrongNotestrong This is a simplified version of the real code there are more async methods between the controller and the EAsync method.p

I CAN use the same script to insert multiple rows via phpMyAdmin, however. Via SequelPro only the last row is enteredp  precodeinsert into country countrydesc, countrypop values Monaco, NULL insert into country countrydesc, countrypop values Mongolia, NULL insert into country countrydesc, countrypop values Montenegro, NULL insert into country countrydesc, countrypop values Montserrat, NULL codepre  p...though i think my tests have shown it isnt the script at fault. The country table has an autoincrement column, countryid, which is working fine for the single row inserted. p  pIve tried restarting Sequel Pro and my local server MAMP but no joy.

Negative 1012 pI am trying to store some data in a table view controller achieved from an integer and a text string in a normal view controller.p  pComplete descriptionp  pA new random integer will be generated each time you tap a button. Basically the integer will then be visible in the normal view controller in a label. Then you can tap a Save button which basically will let you enter a string of text and then tap Done. After tapping Done, the text you entered, will be shown in a newly generated cell in the table view controller. The text you entered will be shown to the left and the integer which was saved as well when tapping done will be shown to the right in the cell. I am just setting up the cell style as Right Detail in order to do this.p  pI guess this is pretty simple to do but I havent found the completely right way to do it yet.p  pHope you guys have a couple of good ideas on how to set this up. p

Negative 1012 pI have a server application which renders a 30 FPS video stream then encodes and muxes it in realtime into a a hrefhttpsdvcs.w3.orghghtmlmediarawfiletipmediasourcewebmbytestreamformat.html relnofollowWebM Byte Streama.p  pOn the client side, an HTML5 page opens a WebSocket to the server, which starts generating the stream when connection is accepted. After the header is delivered, each subsequent WebSocket frame consists of a single WebM SimpleBlock. A keyframe occurs every 15 frames and when this happens a new Cluster is started.p  pThe client also creates a a hrefhttpsdvcs.w3.orghghtmlmediarawfiletipmediasourcemediasource.html relnofollowMediaSourcea, and on receiving a frame from the WS, appends the content to its active buffer. The codeltvideogtcode starts playback immediately after the first frame is appended.p  pEverything works reasonably well. My only issue is that the network jitter causes the playback position to drift from the actual time after a while. My current solution is to hook into the codeupdateendcode event, check the difference between the codevideo.currentTimecode and the timecode on the incoming Cluster and manually update the codecurrentTimecode if it falls outside an acceptable range. Unfortunately, this causes a noticeable pause and jump in the playback which is rather unpleasant.p  pThe solution also feels a bit odd I know exactly where the latest keyframe is, yet I have to convert it into a whole second as per the W3C spec before I can pass it into codecurrentTimecode, where the browser presumably has to then go around and find the nearest keyframe.p  pMy question is this is there a way to tell the Media Element to always seek to the latest keyframe available, or keep the playback time synchronised with the system clock timep

Negative 1012 pI am writing a vector class and I would like it to have the following characteristicsp  ol liUse static allocation on the stack whenever possible to avoid calling new for efficiency.li liBe able to be instantiated from a pointer if the user prefers to provide a previously allocated array.li liThe class needs to be easily converted to a simple pointer. This allows to use previously written routines in C.li ol  pFind below this simple test problem with the solution I came up with. I use inheritance so Vector inherits from Vectorbase which provides a common interface pure virtual for all vectors. Then I define an empty class Vector that allows me then using partial specialization to have different storage schemes static or dynamic.p  pThe idea behind this is that I just want vector to be a C wrapper to the oldfashioned static array. p  pI like the implementation below. Id like to keep the interface I came up with in main. p  pWhat I dont like is that sizeofVector3  32 when in C a vector of three doubles is 24 bytes.

It does not start the application unless clicked on but seems to be closest to the target.pli lipTile Message is shown if the application has been pinned. But they may be difficult to notice unless the tile is pinned fairly high on the start screen.pli lipRaw Works in more power states but requires the application to be running. This doesnt seem to be a match because I want the notification to be received when the application is not running. I couldnt find information about which application states where raw notifications are handled. I would prefer all.pli ol  pDid I miss something in my research If anyone has a hint of how to put an application in the foreground from a push notification without user interaction it would be greatly appreciatedp  pMy first attempt was to trigger the application start using SMS but that seems to be a no go.

Negative 1012 pIm looking for a way to change the default directory of cd, and Im wondering if this is possible. I tried addingp  prealias cdcd DocumentsGithub pre  pto .bashrc, but this obviously doesnt work because it breaks the cd command so that you cannot use cd for anything but going to that directory. Is there some export that I could put in .bashrc to do this I do not want to change my home directory, just the default directory cd goes to.p

Negative 1012 pIm new to ios development, and Im running into issues relating to memory management and my approaches to dealing with large datasets.p  pRight now, I am loading the csv files and storing the relevant data as objects in memory at app initialization. Some of the csv files are larger than 1MB, and in total, my app uses about 180MB of memory. This is obviously way too high of a number unless the info I found is wrong and this is an acceptable number, then please let me know.p  pI feel as though there is a fundamental flaw in my approach is there a way I can avoid storing the csv files in the project itself Or, is there a kind of lazy loading I can do so that I can simply look up info in the csv file, as opposed to loading all of the data from it at oncep  pAny help would do. I think that I need a new perspective in how to manage this more efficiently.p  pEDIT Most of the information that I need is some sort of key lookup, and the search tree of these lookups may span multiple csv files.p
Negative 1012 pThis is not a homework problem, I promise.p  pIm writing a time series database implementation as a way to learn C.p  pI have a clientserver pair that Ive written. The server is currently an echo server listening to a socket on a port. The client connects to that port and sends lines of input to it. It uses codereadlinecode to get input, codesendcodes it to the client socket, coderecvcodes a line from the client socket, and prints the line to the terminal. Rinse, repeat. The client returns when it gets an codeEOFcode from coderecvcode, at which point it knows the connection is closed.p  pThe problem is that codereadlinecode is blocking, such that if the server process is killed, i.e. I codeSIGINTcode it, the client is still blocking on codereadlinecode. It isnt until after it codesendcodes, then coderecvcodes an codeEOFcode, that it will know the server is gone.p  pWhat I strongwantstrong to happen is for the client to get signaled if theres an codeEOFcode on coderecvcode and immediately exit.p  pWhat I emthinkem I need to do is to create 3 codepthreadscode  2 for a network client codesendcode and coderecvcode and 1 for the terminal. The terminal calls codereadlinecode and blocks. It accepts input, and then uses a codepthreadcondtcode to signal the waiting network client codesendcode thread to send. The network client coderecvcode thread is constantly coderecvcodeing, which will block. If it is an codeEOFcode, it raises codeSIGINTcode, the handler to which codepthreadkillcodes all 3 threads, codefprintfcodes something like Connection closed by server., and calls codeexitcode yes, I know codeexitcode will terminate all threads anyways  its an exercise in cleanliness and to see if I understand C.p  pIs this the appropriate approach Obviously network client terminals do this all the time. Whats the right approachp

Negative 1012 pWere in a period of development where there are a lot of code that is created which may be shortlived, as its effectively scaffolding which at some point gets replaced with something else, but will often continue to exist and be forgotten about.p  pAre there any good techniques for finding the classes in a codebase that arent used  Obviously there will be many false positives eg library classes you might not be using all the standard containers, but you want to know theyre there, but if they were listed by directory then it may make it easier to see at a glance.p  pI could write a script that greps for all codeclass XXXcode then searches again for all instances, but has to omit results for the cpp file that the classs methods were defined in. This would also be incredibly slow  ON2 for the number of classes in the codebasep  pCode coverage tools arent really an option here as this is has a GUI that cant have all functions easily invoked programmatically.p  pPlatforms are Visual Studio 2013 or Xcodeclangp  pEDIT I dont believe this to be a duplicate of the dead code question.

What should I do I know there are a lot of questions like this, but I wanted to ask specifically for what I am trying to do. Also, once I get back to the last commit, can I just pull again from the remote branchp

Negative 1012 pIn order to wrap an integration test around an old legacy process that builds detailed files based on certain inputs, I have the need to dynamically load a DLL by providing the full path to the file.p  pThis test will run on many different developers machines which do not always share the same physical application directory, but will also run on many servers as it makes its way through a Continuous Integration process, and sometimes multiple instances of the application will be running on the same physical machine.

Negative 1012 pFirst off, let me just say that Im still a noob at this real world database stuff, and I was hoping to get some light shed on this situation.p  pI have recently put together a basic asp web application to manage a SQL database with two tables. The tables are as followsp  pKey tablep  pKeyid Keydesc Keynumber  Keylocation Issuedby Empidp  pEmp tablep  pEmpid Empfname Emplname Empphonep  pAs you can see, the tables are linked by the empid field. However, the key table allows for null values in the empid column in case the key is not assigned to an employee.p  pSince this is the case, Im concerned about the overall relationship in the database, and orphan records are becoming a concern. p  pSince the key table allows for null values for that column, does this mean it is not in 1NFp  pAs of now, the web application assigns keys by pulling all records from the key table by selecting all records where empid is null, and then assigning an empid to a selected key.p  pBut the relationship only exists if the key has an associated employee, and it seems like there must be a better way to do this. p  pIts probably a little late to change the app, so Im more or less asking this out of sheer curiosity.p  pI thought I may need an assigned key table and an unassigned key table, but I dont know how I would link them with the current database fields. Can anyone give me some advice on this Or maybe help me figure out a better way to link the database togetherp  pMy main concern is orphan records p  pThis was typed on a mobile, so please forgive me if there are errors.p  pEDIT Thanks a ton to those who responded to this.

Negative 1012 pIt would be difficult to post the code Im working with here, but this what Im trying to dop  pI start with a 300x200 ScrollPane and a 300x200 Canvas, put canvas in scrollpane.p  pWhen a key is pressed, the key should be drawn on the canvas. When multiple keys are pressed, they are added in front of each other.p  pWhen the area for the key to be drawn extends the 300 width limit of the Canvas, the size of the Canvas is increased accordingly and the key is drawn in the new space and the slider is sent further to show the key being pressed. essentially like Notepad or any code editor p  pThe issue is that the slider doesnt actually update its bounds until about 1015ms after the width of the content is increased. To compensate for this, I end up waiting 20ms than changing the slider but this is giving me alot of glitches frames are choppy, other operations are occuring before that mess up slider position, etc.p  pHow do i force the extents of the slider to update so that I can display the new keys in the same frame that they are addedp  pe sample codep  pp  precode  To change this license header, choose License Headers in Project Properties.

Negative 1012 pBy default, there are a default of 1,000 messages stored in the ring buffer on the server.p  pIt doesnt make sense for me to send a lagging client 1,000 updates, but rather just the most recent update.

I have tried a million things, but cannot seem to get a Customer to serialize its Addresses.

We do have a writer interceptor code follows that is used to satisfy some specific requirements.  In it, I call proceed, so the entity is serialized by Jackson.

Negative 1012 pI am trying to store different objects in one global table with void pointer. Problem is how to retrieve the void object back. If I have one common base class, say Object , I can always store the void pointer as Object and then cast back to Object. From Object I can cast further to the specific type.p  precodeclass Object class A  public Object virtual A class B  public A   class C  public Object virtual C  class D public C  A aObj  new B void v  staticcastltObjectgtaObj         scenario 1, try to get as A Object obj  staticcastltObjectgt v A vaobj  dynamiccastltAgt  obj  ok   scenario 2, try to get it as C Object obj  staticcastltObjectgt v C caobj  dynamiccastltCgt  obj  ok, caObj will be null so I can throw exception if this happens codepre  pI know that the solution when I have one common base class is safe, but problem is I cant have common base class, because I dont control all the different types, and cant derive them from Object. The code when I dont have common base classp  precodeclass A virtual A  class B  public A class C virtual C  class D  public C  A aObj  new B void v  dynamiccastltvoidgtaObj to actually store the address of B   scenario 1, try to retrieve object as A A aObj2  staticcastltAgtv A aa  dynamiccastltAgt aObj2  aa should be non null   scenario 2, try to retrieve object as C C cObj  staticcastltCgtv C cc  dynamiccastltCgtcObj  cc should be null codepre  pQuestions p  pScenario 1 I store the void pointer with the address of B  that dynamiccast to void does . then I do  staticcast with A which I know it is not safe, because I originally stored the object in the void ptr as B, and I know that we must store and retrieve the same type of pointer in void. But, then I do further cast with dynamiccast to verify that the object is actually right. so this should work, and dynamiccast should give me the right object p  pScenario 2 Same, but now I am fist staticcasting to C, and then further dynamiccasting , and this time I should get NULL, cause the stored object was actually B.p

Negative 1012 pIve been having an issue with my code concerning arrays and int variables. In the section that I have issues with, Im trying to check if an array in which the user inputs their own integers is in an increasing order, and if it is in an increasing order, the array is printed if not, an error message is displayed. I am trying to do this using int two variables, one called c1 and another called orderCheck1 both initialized to 0.p  precodeint[ ] list1  new int [10000]  int a1 0 int b1 0 int c1 0 int value1 int orderCheck1 0  while a1 0   if b1 lt list1.length     value1  scan.nextInt     checks to see if value entered is positive     if value1 gt0       list1[b1]  value1       b1          else       a1 1           while c1 ltlist1.length1   if list1[c1] gtlist1[c11]     orderCheck1 1      c1   if orderCheck1 0   for int i 0 i lt b1 i     System.out.print list1[i]        else   System.out.println ERROR One or both arrays are not in an increasing order.  codepre  pBasically, if a number in the array is larger than the number following it, orderCheck will become 1. Later in the code, it checks if orderCheck1 is either zero or one. If orderCheck1 is zero, then the ints in the array are printed if it is one, then the error message is displayed. The issue is, no matter what I enter, orderCheck1 always becomes a one, so the error message is always printed. What is wrong with my codep  pNote When the user enters values into the array, they are supposed to enter a negative number to stop entering values.p

Negative 1012 pI know very little about VBA, but Im trying to design a userform for an excel workbook. The idea is click the button, bring up the userform, enter info, hit OK, and your info is formatted correctly and inserted into the worksheet. p  pI have 3 userforms that all work fine, but any macro I create that references one of them just does not recognize that that particular userform exists. p  pThe code Im having a problem with is pretty straightforwardp  precodePrivate Sub LiquidFormButtonClick  LiquidEntryUserform.Show  End Sub codepre  pEdit Update So I tried making a new userform, with a different name. I copied and pasted all of the controls from the object over to the new userform, changed the name of the macro to bring up the userform, and voila, it works. However, now the userform itself doesnt do anything because none of the controls actually have any codes behind them telling them what to do. Thats fine, Ill just copy over the codes from the broken form and BOOM now it doesnt work. Soooo something in the very very simple coding within the userform itself is preventing it from being shown, even though the new userform AND the broken one both, in fact, do everything else they need to do besides show up. Ill post the full userform code up later on after some dabbling. Thank youp

Negative 1012 pCant seem to articulate this problem well enough to look this up.

If my table contains 1.2 million records where Something  something, I dont want to retrieve all of them at the same time. Instead, I want to page the data, grabbing as few records as possible. But with this method, it seems that this is a moot point. p  pstrongIf I understand it correctly, the first statement is still retrieving the 1.2 million records, emthenem it is being paged as necessary.strongp  pstrongDoes paging in this way actually improve performance If the 1.2 million records are going to be retrieved every time, whats the point besides the obvious UI benefitsstrongp  pAm I misunderstanding this Any .NET gurus out there that can give me a lesson on LINQ, paging, and performance when dealing with large data sets p

Negative 1012 pI hope this is the right place to post.p  pI am a a full stack dev with a  focus on the backend for the last few years so I am trying to make sure I am approaching this the right way and that there isnt a newer way to do this then my proposed solution belowp  pSee the attached screen shot. This is the main nav  for a freelance project I took on. It is not a problem on the pages without a hero image, but where there is a hero, I need the image to be masked as shown. If you cant see it, the selected nav item has a triangle underneath it that is attached to a 2px red line that extends the width of the screen. This triangle is made by this same 2px red line and if there is a hero image, the top of the image is masked by this red line and some white space about 8 pixels equal to the height of the triangle.p  pstrongMy Proposed Solutionstrong I was going to have the designer prepare a graphic for me that is a long png, about 3000 by 8, the only transparency being the part underneath the triangle. When the page loads I was going to load the graphic and position it absolutely underneath the selected nav item with JS, masking the image beneath it.p  pstrongMy Questionstrong  Is there a better way to achieve this in 2015  ie clip paths Is there a good tutorial on the subject  everything I see is for more elaborate things that dont involve added graphics ie the red line and white mask at the top.p  pstrongThe Effectstrong img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqe8LQ.png altenter image description herep  pEDITp  pThis is the js I will use to get the proper offset for my lofi 2011ish solution, observant devs will notice the wordpress generated classesp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt         var x  mainnav .currentmenuitem a.offset.left         var y  mainnav .currentmenuitem a.offset.top         var w  mainnav .currentmenuitem a.width         var cx  x  w  2          get target width and set x offset         tw  maskingselection.width         tx  cx  tw2          move the masking item         maskingselection.offsettop y20, left tx      ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 1012 pI am new to PHP and very likely I am using the incorrect approach because I am not used to think like a PHP programmer.p  pI have some files that include other files as dependencies, these files need to have global code that will be executed if codePOSTcode contains certain values, something like thisp  precodeif issetPOST[SomeValue]        code goes here    codepre  pAll the files will contain this code section, each one its own code of course.p  pThe problem is that since the files can be included in another one of these files, then the code section I describe is executed in every included file, even when I post trhough AJAX and explicitly use the URL of the script I want to POST to.p  pI tried using the codeSERVERcode array to try and guess which script was used for the post request, and even though it worked because it was the right script, it was the same script for every included file.p  pQuestion isp  ul liIs there a way to know if the file was included into another file so I can test for that and skip the code that only execute if codePOSTcode contains the required valuesli ul  pstrongNotestrong The files are generated using a python script which itself uses a c library that scans a database for its tables and constraints, the c library is mine as well as the python script, they work very well and if there is a fix for a single file, obviously it only needs to be performed to the python script.p  pI tell the reader empotential answererem about this because I think it makes it clear that I dont need a solution that works over the already existant files, because they can be regenerated.p

Negative 1012 pI have a project for a web application developed in java using a database in postgres 9.4, for versioning of code we use SVN, creating branches for changes in the project and when the change is ready and tested is merge to the trunk having a working project without errors.p  pNow, the problem is that the database is unique and is not versioned, and we make the changes directly into a single database and then if we want to use it for the trunk version may be errors because the database has changes which are not yet implemented in the trunk version.p  pWe tried to work on a copy of the database along with the branches but what happened to us is that after change we dont always update the DB trunk so we generated errors.p  pIs there any way to include the database changes in SVN How could be the best way to handle these changesp

So, i make sure i only have one jquery.. version resident at a time. p  pMy second thought was, is my System.Web.Helper.dll at 2.0.0.0 and was my local copy property changed to true. p  pMy last thought was if my page was the only DOM displayed during this issue, i fixed that by doing Layout  null for testing my page is NOT a partial page. p  pSo, My question is, what causes an ajax call to fire twice when using webgrid.Pager    p  pthanks for your time p

Negative 1012 pWould it be naive to create a TCP socket with a listen backlog set to minimum as a way of rate limiting new incoming connections The server workload in question doesnt expect many new connections at any time but spends a lot of time servicing long open persistent connections. It appears that new incoming connections shouldnt affect established connections, though Ive been unable to find any definitive answer in any text. Is it possible for failed new incoming connections to create some kind of TCP traffic congestion on the server with the packets its receiving or are they dropped fast enough that it has no effect on any buffers or other part of the network stack p  pSpecifically the platform in use is Linux, and although it may be handled differently in different OSs, I expect them to all behave roughly the same.p  pstrongEDITstrong What I mean by the same is that backlog doesnt affect established connections, though I do understand Linux discards them while Windows sends a reset.p
Negative 1012 pI am having some trouble with my code currently. I have a button that is supposed to loop through an ImageView array list I have created and display 4 cards everytime it is pressed. Right now I can get my Play button to work, its main function is to just display the cards 1 time and then be disabled. The Deal button is supposed to display 4 random cards every time I press it, until all of the cards are gone. Right now I can get it to change 1 card 1 time and then I get a Duplicate Children error. I know that the issue has to do with looping through the same border panes each time, but I was hoping for some advice on a good way to fix this issue. I know it might involve changing my code around a good bit and thats okay.

Negative 1012 pI am new to Elastic Search. I am using Java, Elastic Search and Spring. My scenario is that I have a jQuery Table on a page. This table is a list of all the Users. Associated with users is a codeSetcode of extra information, well call this codeextraDataValuescode. This could be anything, the most important thing is that the value stored is a codeStringcode value, which could be a formatted codeDatecode or codeDateTimecode String value. Here it is in JSONp  precodeextraDataValues [              id 3,         extraDataValueObject              id 12,             label Metadata Date,             displayable true         ,         value 01012015 000111     ,              id 4,         extraDataValueObject              id 13,             label Metadata TextBox,             displayable true         ,         value zzzz      ], codepre  pThis brings me to the problem. Given that I have a nested codeextraDataValuescodeset in Users with codeextraDataObjectscode, how can Ip  ul liPerform a sort on a specific extraDataObject with either ID 12 or 13 that resides in extraDataValues. Basically, in Java I would get the codeSetcode of codeextraDataValuescode and within there I would search for all the codeextraDataValueObjectscode with ID 12, then I would see if that is a Date Time and sort it as a Date Timeli liPerform a sort on a String value if it is a Date or Date Timeli lihow can I dynamically change the mapping during runtime so I can perform such a dynamic sortingli liHow can I do this in plain Elastic Search and how can I translate this to Javali ul  pI can figure whether the value is going to be a codeDateTimecode or a String in Java but I have no idea how to translate this to Elastic Search in Java. p  pUser object return from Elastic Search after a simple queryp  precodeUser      id 1,      extraDataValues [                      id 1,

Negative 1012 pFor those how not know about inversion.p  pInversionp  pGiven an array A of N integers, an inversion of the array is defined as any pair of indexes i,j such that i lt j and A[i]  A[j].p  pInshortp  pstronginvA     Ai,Aj,  i lt j  and  Ai  Ajstrongp  pFor example, the array a2,3,1,5,4 has three inversions 1,3, 2,3, 4,5, for the pairs of entries 2,1, 3,1, 5,4.p  pTotal inversion count  3.p  pWell, I tried to solve this question by utilizing the standard merge sort. Here is how I think it works.p  pAssume that at some stage, partA and partb of your merge sort is p  ppartA [1,2,3].p  ppartB [4,5]p  pNow, Let X be the element of the first array, partA.

Negative 1012 pSo I am currently working on a WinForms project that requires the use of a WebService. This WebService is referenced in the Project, so there is only one WebService running, this WebService is placed in a Cloud Service with Azure.

Negative 1012 pIve been using Mayavi to make some very nice vector plots lately.

Namely, the magnitude of all the vectors is 1. The quiver3d function gives a vector its color based on its magnitude, so right now every vector is one color. However, the information I need to convey is based on orientation of the vectors.p  pId love if someone could help me figure out how to color vectors in Mayavi using the vectors direction and NOT its magnitude.p

Negative 1012 pI know that I should measure children in codeonMeasurecode and layout them in codeonLayoutcode. The question is in what of these methods should I addrecycle views so I could measure all children together with an eye on how they are mutually positioned i.e. grid, list or whateverp  pMy first approach was to addrecycle views in codeonLayoutcode but from that point I cant measure my children because they arent added to AdapterView yet and codegetChildCountcode returns code0code in codeonMeasurecode.

One of the properties of the Fields class is this checkbox.

I put the results into an annonymous type YogaSpaceResults and you can see that it contains the LocationPoints data that I want to store in my viewmodel.p  precodevar events  from u in context.YogaSpaceEvents     orderby u.YogaSpace.Address.LocationPoints.DistancemyLocation     where         u.DateTimeScheduled gt classDate ampamp         u.YogaSpace.Address.LocationPoints.DistancemyLocation lt 8047             select new YogaSpaceResults                                  LocationPoints  u.YogaSpace.Address.LocationPoints,                 Title  u.YogaSpace.Overview.Title,                 Summary  u.YogaSpace.Overview.Summary,                 Date  u.DateTimeScheduled             .ToPagedListpage, 10 codepre  pand in my view Im doing something like thisp  precodeforeach var space in Model.YogaSpaces              ltdivgt             lth4gtspace.Titlelth4gt             ltdivgt                 space.Summary                 ltbrgt                 space.Date             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         lthr gt      codepre
Negative 1012 pIm using the reactnativeinvertiblescrollview for my messaging app. p  pWhen new messages come, I unshift the new elements to the immutable list in order to show them on the bottom of the screen which is the top of the invertible scroll view. If I use layout animation, the effect is not as what I expected because the index of every previous messages changes. So instead of movingshifting up, the messages change to new messages.p  pIs there a better way to animate the effect just as the effect when appending an element to the list Thanksp

Negative 1012 pI have a ViewController that uses a class call it codeAcode from a framework outside of my control. codeAcode provides a class function I need call it codefcode. I want to make codeAcode easy to mock out in tests. p  pSo my idea was to create a protocol codePcode that has the same signature as codeAcode, extend A to implement P, and then create a mock class codeMcode that also implements codePcode and has a dummy implementation of codefcode. Then in my tests, I could just do codeviewController.dependency  Mcode and everything should be dandy.p  pThis is easier said than done, for reasons Im hoping youll help me understand.p  pInside my viewController, its easy to declare a variable that contains a protocolconforming instance and then reassign the variable to another Protocolconforming instancep  precode works var dependency P  A dependency.f dependency  M dependency.f codepre  pBut it doesnt work to do the same thing with just the typesp  precode doesnt work var dependency  A.self dependency  M.self   cannot assign value of M.Type to a value of type A.Type   also doesnt work var dependency P  A.self  type A.Type does not conform to protocol P codepre  pIs there a way to make this work I thought maybe I could use a generic type for codedependencycode but I cant figure out a syntax to declare a generic type for a variable assignment.p

Negative 1012 pI am trying to port some code that works in Delphi XE8 to Delphi 10 Seattle. This code calls the GetPath function in Winapi.Windows.p  pThe new Win32 API function signature isp  precodefunction GetPathDC HDC Points PPointL Types PByte nSize Integer Integer stdcall codepre  pIn XE8, previously the function had var Points,Types which is known commonly as a var untyped parameter.p  pFixing the code to work with Delphi 10 Seattle means unifying the arbitrary types in the application code to use exactly the types declared in the unit itself. However what is confusing me is that there are two types, PPointL, and TPoint, and when I get the GetPath function working, the data it populates is populated into an array of POINTL records, declared thus in Winapi.Windowsp  precodetype   POINTL  record       ptl      x Longint     y Longint   end   EXTERNALSYM POINTL   PPointL  TPointL   TPointL  POINTL codepre  pHowever, there is also another type TPoint, declared in System.Typesp  precode TPoint  record     X FixedInt     Y FixedInt   public codepre  pElsewhere, FixedInt is aliased to Longint for both 32 bit and 64 bit Windows, and so TPoint and POINTL are equivalent, as far as I can tell, on the Windows platform at least.p  pIf existing application component code is all using a type named TPoint, like thisp  precodeprocedure AddPointconst PTPoint codepre  p... What sense am I to make of the situation on the ground inside the RTL sources in Delphi 10 What should my approach to fixing this be  Alias TPoint to POINTL at the unit level p  pHow do I fix this and proceed  Since this code is a commercial component, Im thinking Ill wait until the vendor fixes this, but then, I think that understanding the POINTL and TPoint in the RTL, and why these structures are redundantlyduplicated in definition, would help others porting low level Win32 Code from Delphi XE8 to Delphi 10 Seattle.p  pUpdate As a workaround, I find I can redeclare an import of the function GetPath, and have it remain as var untyped in my own private unit implementation area import, and continuep  precodeifdef D23 POINTERMATH ON        Delphi 10 Seattle function GetPathDC HDC Points PPointL Types PByte nSize Integer Integer stdcall        previously had var Points,Types untyped, const    gdi32      gdi32.dll  EXTERNALSYM GetPath function GetPathDC HDC var Points, Types nSize Integer Integer stdcall external gdi32 name GetPath endif codepre

Negative 1012 phave looked but cant find a solution to this on SO.p  pstrongThe problemstrong I would like to add buttons to a UIImageView that is zoomable however when the image zooms in, the buttons remain in the same place on the image but do not zoom ie they stay the same size. This is similar to what Maps does if it has many pins on the map, when you zoom in on the Map if the pins are close together they spread apart and stay the same size, rather than zooming to huge sizes with the mapp  pstrongMy attemptstrong I understand how to make the image zoom, through use of a scroll view however I am unsure of what the view hierarchy should be. The button locations depend on the image and so you cannot add the buttons to just the scroll as they wouldnt move when zooming. However, if I add the buttons to the image view then they zoom with the image since I return the image view for the delegate method viewForZoomingInScrollView. I have tried tinkering with an overlayer for the buttons with clues from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11204837zoomingabackgroundimagewithoutzoomingtheoverlayZooming a background image without zooming the overlaya but havent found anything that works yet.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated, thanks a lotp

Negative 1012 pServices can always be shut down by the OS.  As such they seem less reliable to me than an AlarmManager.  I have to do periodic updates every 12 seconds.  Is it better to use background thread in a service or AlarmManager. Since there are ways to use AlarmManager without waking up the app.  See a hrefhttpvikinghammer.com20120422androidusealarmmanagerinsteadofaservicewithatimertask relnofollowhttpvikinghammer.com20120422androidusealarmmanagerinsteadofaservicewithatimertaskap  pI wonder what advantage all the Timer, Thread, and Service code have  One thought I had against AlarmManager is that the task code must execute somewhere, so upon receiving it a BroadcastReceiver seems like wrong place to execute code. How about passing off to an IntentService  Is this higher overhead than all the thread management inside a running background service  Without AlarmManager how can we guarantee the background service really stays up and runningp  pJust to clarify, my app will run in background while other apps are allowed to be run by user. I will stop some of them, but let others run for long time. As such I dont think service checking every 2 seconds, guarantees it will be kept around while users are engaged with other apps. But if alarm manager, I can guarantee checks are always done rightp
