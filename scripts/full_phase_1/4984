Positive 4984 pOn a our Heroku Rails 4.2 web app running Unicorn workers, where each worker needs about 230MB, we can run 2 per 1X Heroku dyno, or 4 per 2X Heroku dyno.

Negative 4984 pI have four tables A,B,C,D where A is the parent of one to many relationships with B and C.  C and D are parents to a one to many relationship with table D.  Conceptually, the primary keys of these tables could bep  ul liA Aid li liB Aid, bnum with foreign key to Ali liC Aid, cnum with foreign key to Ali liD Aid, bnum, cnum with foreign keys to B and Cli ul  pWhere the num columns auto increment based on each parent id in the relationship rather then on each record.   I used this approach on a previous application, and it was not an issue since the creation of B and C records was done by a sequential process by generating a new num value via a select max query.  I was never really satisfied with the approach, but it got the job done.  p  pFor the specific case I am working on now, records in tables A and B are entered by users so autogeneration of ids is not an issue.  In the case of tables C and D, records in these tables are being generated by multiple concurrent batch processes so their identifiers will need to be generated some how.  The previous method I listed will not work do to the race condition.  p  pNote that this is for an Oracle database so I will be using sequences and not autoincrement columns.p  pGiven the constraints above, how you would you design tables to represent A,B,C, and D so that the relationships between the entities are properly enforced AND application code would not be required to generate any identifiersp

Negative 4984 pWe are experiencing random intermittent slowdowns in our ASP.NET application. Most pages take between 100500ms to render depending on which modules are used on the page. Occasionally however  perhaps 1 in 100 requests, these figures are more like 500010000ms. This is not a database related issue  I have checked for slow queries, and is not related to the complexity of the page  e.g. a page which takes 100ms is just as likely to take 10000ms when it slows down.

If this returns with status code 500, the webserver will be restarted. The server will restart in under a minute, so theres no need to check for restarts already running.p  pThe server in question is a ubuntu 8.04 minimal installation with just enough packages installed to run what it currently needs. There is no hard requirement to do the task in bash, but Id like it to run in such a minimal environment without installing any more interpreters. p  pIm sufficiently familiar with scripting that the commandoptions to assign the http status code to an environment variable would be enough  this is what Ive looked for and could not find.p

Negative 4984 pIm going to be tracking different versions of potentially millions of different files, and my intent is to hash them to determine Ive already seen that particular version of the file. Currently, Im only using MD5 the product is still in development, so its never dealt with millions of files yet, which is clearly not long enough to avoid collisions.p  pHowever, heres my question  strongAm I more likely to avoid collisions if I hash the file using two different methods and store both hashes say, SHA1 and MD5, or if I pick a single, longer hash like SHA256 and rely on that alonestrong I know option 1 has 288 hash bits and option 2 has only 256, but assume my two choices are the same total hash length.p  pSince Im dealing with potentially millions of files and multiple versions of those files over time, Id like to do what I can to avoid collisions. However, CPU time isnt completely free, so Im interested in how the community feels about the tradeoff  is adding more bits to my hash proportionally more expensive to compute, and are there any advantages to multiple different hashes as opposed to a single, longer hash, given an equal number of bits in both solutionsp

Negative 4984 pIve got a codenavigationBarcode that does not autoresize when rotating the device anymore. So the navigationBar keeps its portrait height of 44 pixels and does not shrink down to 32 pixels. Im using a custom codeUITabBarControllercode subclass which initializes the codeUINavigationControllercodes and adds them to its codeviewControllerscode array. Since Im adding a codeUIImageViewcode as a custom background to the codenavigationBarcode  which is being updated nicely when rotating  I always see the 12 pixel difference under my custom view. This differnce overlaps the codeUITableViewcode also by the 12 pixels. So everything seems to be working fine except the ordinary codeUINavigationBarcode.

Negative 4984 pIve been working on creating a SAAJ based client. Everything seemed to be working fine, until I implemented the logic to send attachments as part of a webservice request.p  pThe webservice operation is simple  it expects a string element for filelocation, and a base64binary element for the file content.p  pIve tested the ws operation using SoapUI, and everything seems to be in order. However, when i send the file attachment from my SAAJbased client, the webservice operation would only receive the filelocation elements value. I wrote a handler at the wsserver to intercept the WS operation request, in order to see whether the attachment even reaches the webservice. As expected, the attachment was reaching fine, and i could access its contents using the SAAJ api within the handler. p  pThat just leads me to wonder  is there any compatibility issue when sending attachments using SAAJ and receiving them through JAXB bindings is there something im missing outp  pthanks for any helpp

Negative 4984 pI am just starting out on an idea of a Google App engine app that interacts with Facebook.  All my coding experience is number crunching in Matlab, which is so high level, a lot of real coders havent even heard of it.  I am attempting to extend the example provided by facebook a hrefhttpsgithub.comfacebookpythonsdkblobmasterexamplesappengineexample.py relnofollowherea.  So far, the only thing Ive tried to add is reading in a list of the users friends.  Ive put comments ahead of the lines I added in my version of the code below.  The code succeeds in loading in the user from facebook.  I can access the various user properties and display them.  However, the friends property that I tried to add is always a blank list.  I think the difference is that things like name and id are JSON strings that can be handled like Python strings but graph.getconnections returns an array of JSON objects as the list of friends.  I think I should be turning this JSON array into a python dictionary but I dont know how.  Of course, I may be completely wrong about that.p  pI would really appreciate a tip as to how I can get the users list of friends into a python list of some kind that I can manipulate.p  pThanks,p  pDessiep  precodeusrbinenv python   Copyright 2010 Facebook   A barebones AppEngine application that uses Facebook for login.

Negative 4984 pI have made an application, called MemoryLauncher, that pulls the binary of another applications executable into memory and runs it.  The purpose of MemoryLauncher is to allow me to overwrite the .EXEs of the other programs when an update is available without having to worry about another user running and locking the program.  This works really well for me except for one thing dragdrop.  I have created a device manager program that MemoryLauncher will execute and this program requires the dragdrop feature but it seems to be disabled when the .EXE is called into memory.  If I launch the device manager normally, then the dragdrop feature works fine.

The way the program is set up is so that users are able to check Keep Me Logged In, which the program will then do. So I think the issue is actually that Firefox isnt letting the user logout.

Negative 4984 pa noob question here.p  pI have an app that does number calculations. I support different foreign languages and try to test them in the iOS simulator as much as I can. p  precently I got a bad review from a Korean user where the complaint seems to be something to the extent of getting only input errors ... something ... floating point ... something. The online translation does not work that well.p  pnow, my app checks the input entered by the user and displays input error message when it detects characters that are not valid for that particular input field. I check the asc value of each character entered. maybe this is part for the problem. but on the other hand isnt asc 48 number zero in ANY input language p  pso my question is ... if I setup the iOS simulator to lets say Korean language, test my application enter numbers, make calculation, etc and it seemingly works just fine ... whats out there in the real Korean world that my application might not be agreeing with ... or that I am unable to testsimulate with the iOS simulator.p  psigh I wish there was a way to communicate with people that leave reviews ... it would make life so much easier.p

Negative 4984 pI will start by saying I have already looked thoroughly in stack overflow, nhusers and the documentation for a possible solution to my issue.p  pI need to be able to query only the base class table in parts of my multifuture query when eagerly loading associations although from the research I have done I dont think this is possiblep  pI have started to map an existing schema using fluent nhibernate as a proof of concept. I have mapped an inheritance hierarchy using table per sub class The mappings all work perfectly fine so I wont paste them all in here. The hierarchy has around 15 sub classes and the base class has some additional associations. E.g.p  precodeBase Dictionaryltstring, Attributegt Attributes ListltEntityChangegt Changes codepre  pI need to eagerly load both of the collections as in the given scenario they are required for post processing and lazily loading them causes performance issues. I am eagerly loading them by a multi  future queryp  precode    var baseQuery  session.CreateCriterialtBasegtb         .CreateCriteriaNested, JoinType.LeftOuterJoin         .CreateCriteriaNested2, JoinType.LeftOuterJoin         .CreateCriteriaNested2.AdditionalNested, JoinType.LeftOuterJoin      var logsQuery  session.CreateCriterialtBasegtb.CreateAliasChanges, c, JoinType.LeftOuterJoin,             Expression.AndExpression.Gec.EntryDate, changesStartDate, Expression.Lec.EntryDate, changesEndDate             .AddOrderOrder.Descc.EntryDate      var attributesQuery  session.CreateCriterialtBasegtt.SetFetchModeAttributes, FetchMode.Join      logsQuery.FutureltBasegt     attributesQuery.FutureltBasegt     var results  baseQuery.FutureltBasegt.ToList codepre  pThe queries execute and return the correct results. But just to eagerly load the associations in this manner means that the attribute and changes queries have to perform a polymorphic fetch the addition of about 15 left outer joins per query that arent required. I know this is required for polymorphic querying but the base query will return the hierarchy that I desire. The other parts of the multi query that are issuing a polymorphic query are redundant.p  pI havent yet mapped the whole of the hierarchy so there will be additional unecessary joins being performed and there are also other associations that could be loaded up front. These two combined without the addition of an increase in volume will lead to performance issues. The performance currently of this query is about 6 seconds which admittedly is better than the 20 its currently taking but by messing around a bit with the query and taking out the extra joins I can get it down to about 2 seconds this is a common query so getting it as low as possible is beneficial not just pleasing to me. It will also be run from multiple distributed machine so I would rather not get into a discussion about caching  2nd level caching. p  pI have triedp  ol liusing the class modifier in the query class  base. I initially done this blindly but believe this is for discriminator values. Even if it is for the case statement in the SQL this will not prevent the extra joins.li liDoing everything in a single query. This is slower than splitting it up as above and gives the cartesian productli liUsing Polymorphism.Explicit in the fluent mappings. This has no effect as I am using ClassMap with SubclassMaps so it is ignored. I tried changing all the maps to ClassMaps and using Join but this didnt give the desired behaviour.li liTried to trick nhibernate into joining the base class table onto itself for loading associations basically load a more concrete type to prevent the polymorphic query  create a derived class BaseOnlyLoading which uses the same table and primary key as the base class. This was obviously a hack but I was just trying to see whats possible. NHibernate doesnt allow the class and sub class to use the same table.li liDefine the BaseOnlyLoadingMap to be a classmap with the same assocations as the BaseMap with a join back onto the Base. This was hopeful as assocation collections are resolved in the context based on full type name. li liUse an interceptor which modifies the SQL that before its execute.

Negative 4984 pI have long known that you can load style rules into a page dynamically by using addRule and insertRule, depending on whether it is IE or a standards compliant browser.  But I just discovered that on Chrome, a much more generallyuseful for me approach works just fine create a style element, add a texnode to it with arbitrary css text it could be the contents of a css file, then add that to the document.  You can also remove it by removing that style node from the document.  For instance this function works fine when I send it the string div backgroundcolor red n p fontfamily georgia p  precodevar applyCss  function cssString    var scriptNode  document.createElementstyle   scriptNode.appendChilddocument.createTextNodecssString   document.getElementsByTagNamehead[0].appendChildscriptNode   return scriptNode  codepre  pWhile I understand the benefits of doing it on a rule basis in some scenarios, this shortcut which is kind of analogous to using innerHTML instead of building elements part by part using DOM techniques would be particularly useful to me in a lot of situations if I can count on it working.p  pIs it consistently supported  Is there any downside to this approach  Im particularly curious because Ive never seen this approach suggested anywhere.p
Negative 4984 pI have this application Windows form application written in Visual C from a colleague of mine and I face some serious problems. The application is neither a service neither a normal application, I mean it has a GUI but most of the time it runs in background it should react as a service but its not. This application is preventing the user to log off, and I need to be able to do that.p  pI know that Windows sends the codeWMQUERYENDSESSIONcode message to all running applications when the user tries to log off. I have tried to catch this message on my codeWndProccode function and to kill the application by force but it only works once. When I login again and try to log off the operation is not terminated because my application wont close.p  pIf I try to use codeSessionEndingcode event, the application is only put to the system tray and remains there without logging off but this I believe its because the codeFormClosingcode method performs this operation instead of closing the program this was the requirement and I cant change that.p  pMaybe another useful information is that the application starts automatically because it has an entry in the codeHKLMcode registry and there are always 2 instances of this application running one should supervise the other one and restart it in case of crash but not in case of manually shut down.p  pAny suggestions will be well received.p  pThanks.p

The authentication part is very critical and took a long time to implement, and would take as long to implement again, so I was thinking, after authentications finished, can I convert the blocking socket that I have into a SocketChannels socket so that a Selector can handle its messages in a nonblocking mannerp

I think this is because the Error does not occur within the OperationContract ReturnMyDTOMethod, but instead within the MyDto when is being serialized In other words, it appears the horse has bolted method returns successfully, and it is to late for the IErrorHandler to be of any use  Specifically ProvideFault does not fire but HandleError does fire. Consequently i still get a channel broken message, which requires me to go back to the drawing board  i.e. ensure MyDto does not do anything fancy such as generate an errorp

Negative 4984 pWhats the best design to use in an iphone app that uses core data when you have several view controllers that make similar core data callsp  pCurrently I have an app which has several view controllers which all perform similar functions like adding objects to an entity, deleting an entity, etc.  I figure there are a few ways to handle thisp  p1 Each view controller has its own addItemblah class.  Downside is this results in some copypasta between the classesp  p2 Create a superclass which has the core data methods, and inherit from that class.

Might be useful to have this so I can queue requests and do data management outside of each view controller.  Downside is this feels like a bad idea in generalp
Negative 4984 pIm coding a simple roguelike game in C using SDL library, and I have some problems moving my character on the screen. Each time a frame needs to be rendered, I update the position of the sprite using the update function, which does nothing if the player is standing still. To issue the movement command, and thus starting the animation, I use the step function called only once per each player movement from one tile to another. Upon receiving the up command, the game behaves fine and the character moves smoothly in one second to the new position. However, when the down command is given, he moves at about half the speed, and obviously after one second has passed, he is instantly teleported to the final position, with a sudden flicker. The code for the movement is basically identical, but for the fact that in one case the delta movement is summed to the y position, in the other case is subtracted. Maybe the fact that the position is an integer and the delta is a double is causing problems Does sum and subract behave differently maybe different rounding Here is the relevant code sorry for the lengthp  precodevoid PlayerstepPlayerDirection dir      ifmstatus  STANDING  no animation while standing         return      switchdir          case UP         ifmcurrMapgttileAtmxPos, myPos  mcurrMapgttileHeightgtmtype  TileFLOOR                       if  next tile is not a wall, set up animation             mstatus  WALKINGUP             myDelta  mcurrMapgttileHeight  sprite have to move by a tile             myVel  mcurrMapgttileHeight  1000.0f  in one second             myNext  myPos  mcurrMapgttileHeight  store final destination                  break     case DOWN         ifmcurrMapgttileAtmxPos, myPos  mcurrMapgttileHeightgtmtype  TileFLOOR                      mstatus  WALKINGDOWN             myDelta  mcurrMapgttileHeight             myVel  mcurrMapgttileHeight  1000.0f             myNext  myPos  mcurrMapgttileHeight                  break      ...      default         break           manimTimer  SDLGetTicks   void Playerupdate      manimTimer  SDLGetTicks  manimTimer  get the ms passed since last update      switchmstatus          case WALKINGUP         myPos  myVel  manimTimer  update position         myDelta  myVel  manimTimer  update the remaining space         break     case WALKINGDOWN         myPos  myVel  manimTimer         myDelta  myVel  manimTimer         break      ...      default         break           ifmxDelta lt 0 ampamp myDelta lt 0  if im done moving              mxPos  mxNext  adjust position         myPos  myNext         mstatus  STANDING  and stop          else         manimTimer  SDLGetTicks  else update timer  codepre  pstrongEDITstrong I removed some variables and only left the elapsed time, the speed and the final position.

Negative 4984 pI have a Java client that consumes SharePoint 2010 standard web services sitedata.asmx, permissions.asmx, etc written with JAXWS implementation from the JDK 6.p  pSo far, authentication is done with NTLM using a custom codeAuthenticatorcode implementation and codeAuthenticator.setDefault...code approach.p  pWhen running on my test environment which has only one SharePoint server, it works fine. I can see all the NTLM negotiation using WireShark.p  pBut, if running on a costumer which has multiple servers, hardware load balancing and multiple SharePoint alternate access mappings I get Error 401 Unauthorized from the web service calls. I havent had a chance to use WireShark to debug on that environment.p  pI run my client from a Windows machine on the costumer setup, so according to Java documentation it should be fine for NTLM. Also, I used the default URL from SharePoint to access the web services not the load balanced URLs.p  pThe machine running the client application, is not a SharePoint server. It has Windows Integrated Authentication with NTLM configured.p  pAlso, due SharePoint administration policies, Im unable to access SharePoint Central Administration or do any change to the configuration nor IIS.p  pI want to ask if anyone knows what the issue may be And hopefully if anyone knows how to fix itp  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIts important to mention, that the same permission levels were granted on both environments.p

Negative 4984 pIm having trouble with zooming TIFF images loaded into a codeQGraphicsViewcode with codeQGraphicsPixmapItemcode.p  pThe problem is more maintaining image quality along with having a zoom speed that doesnt make the application choke. To begin with I was just replacing the image with a scaled codeQPixmapcode  I used codeQt.FastTransformationcode while the user was holding down a horizontal slider and then when the slider was released replaced the pixmap again with another scaled pixmap using codeQt.SmoothTransformationcode. This gave a nice quality zoomed image but the zooming was jerky after the image size started to increase to larger than its original size zooming out of the image was fine.p  pUsing QTransform.fromScale on the QGraphicsView gives much smoother zooming but a lower quality image, even when applying code.setRenderHintsQPainter.Antialiasing  QPainter.SmoothPixmapTransform  QPainter.HighQualityAntialiasingcode to the QGraphicsView.p  pMy latest approach is to combine the two methods and use a codeQTransformcode on the codeQGraphicsViewcode to have the smooth zooming but when the user releases the slider replace the image in the codeQGraphicsViewcode with a scaled pixmap. This works great, but the position in the view is lost  the user zooms in to one area and because the scaled pixmap is larger the view jumps to another location when the slider is released and the higher quality scaled pixmap replaces the previous image.p  pI figured that as the width height ratio is the same in both images I could take the percentages of the scrollbars before the image swap and apply the same percentages after the swap and things should work out fine. This works well mostly, but there are still times when the view jumps after swapping the image.p  pIm pretty sure Im doing something quite wrong here. Does anybody know of a better way to do this, or can anyone spot something in the code below that could cause this jumpingp  pThis is the code to saverestore the scrollbar location. They are methods of a subclassed codeQGraphicsViewcodep  precodedef storescrollbarpositionself     xmax  self.horizontalScrollBar.maximum     if xmax         x  self.horizontalScrollBar.sliderPosition         self.scrollxpercentage  x  100  floatxmax      ymax  self.verticalScrollBar.maximum     if ymax         y  self.verticalScrollBar.sliderPosition         self.scrollypercentage  y  100  floatymax   def restorescrollbarpositionself     xmax  self.horizontalScrollBar.maximum     if self.scrollxpercentage and xmax         x  xmax  floatself.scrollxpercentage  100         self.horizontalScrollBar.setSliderPositionx      ymax  self.verticalScrollBar.maximum     if self.scrollypercentage and ymax         y  ymax  floatself.scrollypercentage  100         self.verticalScrollBar.setSliderPositiony codepre  pAnd here is how Im doing the scaling. codeself.imageFilecode is a codeQPixmapcode and codeself.imagecode is my codeQGraphicsPixmapItemcode.

Negative 4984 pI am developing a fairly large C support library, and have found myself moving towards a headeronly approach. In C this almost works because you can implement where you define in classes. For templated methods, the implementation has to be in the same file anyway, so I find that it is much easier to just keep the implementation with the definition.p  pHowever, there are several times where sources must be used. As just one example, circular dependencies sometimes occur and the implementation has to be written outside the class definition. Here is how I am handling itp  precodepart of libfoo.h class Bar    void CircularDependencyvoid   ifdef LIBFOOCOMPILEINLINE void BarCircularDependencyvoid    ...  endif codepre  pThen the project that uses libfoo would do the following in main.cppp  precodemain.cpp define LIBFOOCOMPILEINLINE include libfoo.h codepre  pAnd in any other .cppp  precodeother.cpp include libfoo.h codepre  pThe point is that the compileinline section only gets compiled once in main.cpp.p  pAnd finally my question is there a name for this idiom or any other projects that work this way It just seems to be a natural outcome of the implementation and definition being blurred by templating and class methods. And are there any reasons why this is a bad idea or why it would potentially not scale wellp  pemQuick aside I know that many coders, with good reason, prefer their headers to resemble interfaces and not implementations, but IMHO documentation generators are better suited to describing interfaces because I like to hide private members all together emp

Negative 4984 pIm looking at wrapping some c libraries in c and Im not sure what is the best way to wrap opaque pointers. p  pWhen the Cstructure is part of the public APIp  precodetypedef struct SomeType      int a     int b  SomeTypet codepre  pWhere there are several member functionsp  precodevoid SomeTypeFoo SomeTypet obj, ...  void SomeTypeBar SomeTypet obj, ...  codepre  pI like the approach of deriving from the base to simply associate these member functions as actual class members. i.e.p  precodeclass SomeTypeWrapper     public SomeTypet      void foo ...      void bar ...   codepre  pAs far as my understanding goes, I believe that codeSomeTypeWrappercode is binary compatable with codestruct SomeTypecode such that codeSomeTypeWrappercode can be casted tocodeSomeTypetcode so that the c method implementation might bep  precodeSomeTypeWrapperfoo ...       SomeTypeFoo SomeTypetthis, ...   codepre  pSee Note[1]. p  pHowever, in some libraries they like to keep the definition of the structure private I suppose this is to allow changes to the implementation without changing the headersAPI . So in the headers I have something like thisp  precodetypedef struct SomeType SomeTypet codepre  pAnd then all of the member functions deal with these opaque pointers. In order to wrap these methods into an interface, what Ive done so far is to provide a class which contains the pointer. p  precodeclass SomeTypeWrapper      private         SomeTypet mdata      public         SomeTypeWrapper SomeTypet data  mdatadata         void foo...         void bar...  codepre  pThis means that for any function in the c library which returns such an opaque pointer, I have to allocate a new object to carry that pointer around. For a lot of libraries that is probably fine but this design complicates implementing the wrapper and for speedy clibraries that do a lot of smallobject allocation, I suspect that this extra object overhead can lead to a significant performance penalty. In addition, the underlying object may be reference counted so in some cases I have to make decisions about whether SomeWrapperType increases the reference count, implements a copy constructor, has a private constructor, etc.p  pIn most cases Im happy to pay that penalty for the nicer interface, but Im looking for other options. Is there a cleaner way of dealing with opaque cpointers in a c wrapper library Related is there a good way to implement wrapper classes so that the c headers dont have to include the clibrary headers AND doesnt require wrapper object allocationp  pNote[1] I believe this cast is safe as long as the same compiler is used and codeSomeTypeWrappercode adds no additional members and has no virtual methods. By same compiler, Im assuming the clibrary compiled by gcc will work with the c wrapper compiled by the same gcc. Perhaps that is not guaranteed p

Im trying to connect ViewControllers with custom segue. p  pI research a lot of solution across the Internet and found one, which can fit, but the code is scatter all around ViewControllers and AppDelegate Im not certain if Apple will accept it. Im trying put whole code to a CustomSegue.m h. The success is partial because using technique below it segues to the second ViewControler but I cant figure out how to dismiss the second and come back to main screen. I tried various techniques but when I run it the compiler terminates app with bunch of errors. Neither errors nor warnings before building and running. I also tried to dismiss it with a button using [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedYES] or [self dismissViewControllerAnimatedYES completionnil] they work when I try modal segues but with my code with bad result. p  pDoes anyone have a suggestion on a neat way of doing this. Im stack on this problem for the last couple of days. I see that kind of segues transitions in a lot apps so it seems to be quite popular, easy solution. Im not much experienced in Xcode only couple of mo.

Negative 4984 pI want to ask if there is a possible way to conditionally implement interfaces or if there can be a workaround to what I want to do. I want to make two interfaces LangA and LangB that will only hold a very large number of final variables that are Strings used to print messages. As you probably imagine LangA is one language and LangB another one. What I want is have my messagehandling class conditionally implement the interface needed based on the systems locale. I have no idea if this is possible at all in any way even with some custom ibrary, so if not, explain me if it can be worked around at least. Quick question is this possible in Scala thanksbr I have thought of a possible, but maybe not a very resourceefficient workaraound, which will have the classs constructor check the locale and set its own finals based on the values of some methodless class that will only feature the finals for each language e.g. constructor learns that locale is locA so it sets finals myF1LangA.myF1 myF2LangB.myF2 etc. Thanks in advancep

Negative 4984 pIm building a custom jQuery slideshow which effectively looks at each slide and hides all frames within it one at a time, and looks and the next slide, and unhides all the frames within that.

Negative 4984 pGiven an image such as the CakePHP logo, how can this image be converted back into a PSD with the layers. As a human, I can easily work out how to translate this back to a PSD with layers. I can tell that the background is a circular shape with star edges. So the circular star part is at the back, the cake image is on top of this and the words CakePHP is over all of these two images.p  pI can use PhotoshopGimp tools to separate these images into three images and fill in the areas inbetween. Then I have three layers.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNgyRf.png altenter image description herep  pAs a human, it is easy to work out the layering of most logos and images and many images have multiple layers, the CakePHP logo is just one example. Images in the real world also have a layering, there may be a tree layer on top of a background of grass. I need a general way to convert from an image back to the layered representation, ideally a software solution.p  pIn absence of a programmed solution, are there any papers or research which solve this problem or are related to this problem I am mostly interested in converting human constructed images such as logos or website titles back to layered representation.p  hr  pI want to point out some benefits of doing this, if you can get this image to a layered representation automatically then it is more easy to modify the image. For example, maybe you want to make the cake smaller, if the computer already layered the cake on top of the red background, you can just scale the cake layer. This allows for layer adjustment of images on websites which do not have layer information already.p

However it looks like the EXISTS function only verifies if the element exists at the specified index.

Negative 4984 pIs it possible to make it so that MySQL does not flush the cache when the table updates and holds that cache for at least 10 minutes before cache is flushedp  pBasically, Im caching a query that analyzes about 200k records and returns 10 rows of data. The query takes about 1.5  3 seconds. Im using SQLCACHE to cache that query, which after the first time takes 0.007 seconds. The table updates very often multiple times in less than a minute. So I want to make MySQL hold the cache for at least 10 minutes before it flushes that cached query to recalculate.p  pBy the way, the query data is unique to each user on the site.p  pIm using the Codeigniter framework, I know they have a builtin query caching feature however its filesystem based. Which is why I prefer MySQLs caching feature...p  pThanks for all help guysp

Negative 4984 pIf you have a very large say too big time slice for a round robin scheduler what kind of performance effect should I expect in the Operating Systemp  pMy only thought is that processes that require a lot of time would benefit but most processes use a small amount of time, so it would cause a delay in finishing all the smaller processesp  pExample timeslice of 50, and processes P1400, P210, P3  150, P4  20, P5  10, P6  10p  pThis is my best guess I am wondering if there is anything you guys could share as far as a time slice being too small or too large.p

Negative 4984 pI have a numerical code that solves an equation codefx  0code, in which I have to raise codexcode to a power codepcode. I solve it using a bunch of things, but in the end I have Newtons method. The solution happens to be equal to codex  1code, and thus is the cause of my problems. When the iterated solution gets close to code1code, say codex  1  1e13code, the time necessary to compute codestdpowx, pcode grows tremendously, easily by a factor of 100, making my code unusable.p  pThe machine running this thing is AMD64 Opteron 6172 on CentOS, and the command is simple codey  stdpowx, pcode. Similar behavior shows up on all my machines, all x64. As documented a hrefhttpentropymine.comimageworsenerslowpow relnofollowherea, this is not only my problem i.e., someone else is pissed too, appears only on x64 and only for codexcode close to code1.0code. Similar thing happens to codeexpcode. p  pSolving this problem is vital to me. Does anyone know if there is any way of going around this slownessp  pEDIT John pointed out that this is due to denormals.

Negative 4984 pI have a game that I need to figure out a specific issue.p  pWhen you maximize, move or resize the window the DirectX device resets. But before it resets all graphically allocated objects should be released that are not part of the managed pool. As for this game there seems to be 30 unreleased objects when the application quits from basic directx debug library output which leads me to assume that when the device is reset, the same issue occurs. This causes the game to crash when you maximize, move or resize the window which is obviously not acceptable.p  pMore research has resulted in that you can enable excessive debugging in DirectX via DirectX Control Panel, except if you have Windows 8 no such thing is available. You can install the DirectX sdk and open the DirectX Control Panel, but all the features on Direct3D tab is grayed out. This excessive debug output level would then print out the addresses of allocations that have not been released upon exit, which could give me a clue of what is actually not released during a reset device event.p  pThe game is built in C using DirectX 9 libraries with Visual Studio 2010. Ps. Windows 8 comes with DirectX SDK by default but no control panel options, you must manually install the DirectX SDK to get it.p  pMy question is, how can I enable excessive directx debugging on my environment Windows 8 Pro Are there any way you could potentially enable excessive debugging per application in the source while its compiled with directx debug libraries, or must you use the DirectX Control Panel for thatp  pCheers, Nicco.p

If a client has multiple NICs, or changes subnets, the original IP is registered in DNS until the corresponding DHCP record expires this is an AD environment where DHCP registers DNS addresses.p  pIn this scenario DNS has one, incorrect, record for the client. I want to query DHCP by client name, to see all IPs that are leased to it.p  pThe only possible solution I have found is to dump all subnet info from DHCP supported by the below API then query against that, but that is not feasible in my environment, since multiple people would use this application, and I dont want the additional strain on DHCP.p  pI cannot change any configuration for DNS or DHCP.p  pThanks,p  hr  pThis is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2224877queryingadhcpserverincsharpthisa question, but with the referenced API a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa36337928vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowherea, I can only query via IP. Is it possible with this API, or any other, to query DHCP by hostname The issue being, DNS gives me an old IP for MachineA, I want to retrieve any other IPs being leased by MachineA from the DHCP server.p  pEdit To clarify, I want to write a program that I can type in a hostname, it will then query a DHCP server for all IPs for that hostname in any subnet administered by that DHCP server. This is to workaround the issue of a machine with multiple NICs registering an IP that is useless to me wireless, so for instance the DNS result may be NICA wireless but I want NICB wired.p

Negative 4984 pI have a situation where I have nested divs. I have a parent div that has an onclick event and a few divs inside that are being dynamically populated.  Im given to understand that through bubbling, the onclick event should propagate up through the DOM, triggering the onclick event in all parents.  All of the research I have done has shown a bunch of people who are trying to PREVENT this, whereas I cant get it to work.  The only way I can get the onclick to work, is to click near the edges of the div, presumably where the child divs dont exist, and Im clicking directly on the parent.p  pIve included the applicable code below.

Negative 4984 pAttempting to unit test a Grails 2.1.x controller that calls a template to show a list of history items with a status. This controller works fine in manual testing but were attempting to automate things and Im getting stuck on this part. Part of our issue may be that the domain object is over engineered.p  pThe setup for this test may be more integration rather than unit testing but Im not sure I can test the function with out it.p  pThe controller action generates a list of history items via a createCriteria query.

Now the question is, when I use codeModalViewControllercode how can I close the app in a normal way when the longrunning operation failsp  pFor example, my longrunning code is downloading some configs from server. Then, the download fails. I show a codeUIAlertViewcode to the user that reads, Download failed, continue. When user taps Yes, the app continues, but what about No What should I do p  pI believe that the best option is closing the app, but I found that it is not recommended and the app may be rejected during the app approval process. So, I just hide the AlertView and ask the user to press the Home Button to close the app. However, when user starts the app again, the application is not starting from coderootcode, rather it is just resuming from the previous state.p

Negative 4984 pOk, so I have a frontend Silverlight GUI and a backend Windows service running on the server. The front end puts requests in a SQL Server DB and the service deals with them. The bulk of the request is an object that I would like the Silverlight to serialise to an XML string and put in the DB. The Windows service needs to deserilise it.p  pSo I need a class that can be referenced by both Silverlight and a normal C Windows program and can be at least serialised to a string by Silverlight and deserialised from a string by a Windows service.p  pThe object itself does not have anything specific to Silverlight but it has to be in a Silverlight dll for the front end to use it. But that means I have to use Silverlight methods to deserialise it and they dont work when called from the service.p  pThe only thing I can do is write a Serialise method in the class, using Silverlight, and a Deserialise method in the Windows Service, using normal .Net. p  pIs there a better wayp  p Alistair.p

However if I leave it as an NSNumber object when I try and fetch it, its coming back inconsistently as in if I have an NSLog printing it, it comes back as a different value each time I run.p  pI can figure out a fairly obvious workaround, setting unlocked as an NSString to yes or no and compare that at the relevant point, but I wanted to know if anyone knew why this was happening or if there is way to keep it as a Boolean.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 4984 pIm using MVC 4, .Net 4, and Visual Studio 2012.p  pIm trying to use a fairly complex model with one of my views, and Im having serious trouble getting it to bind properly.p  pThe model wraps a Dictionary with integer Keys, and Values that are Lists of Lists of bools.p  pBasically, a search was done on items indicated by the integer, each item had several search terms, and for each of those terms we have a list of results. I display the results on a page, and have a checkbox next to each result. For each result, the user will indicate whether they want some stuff done by the next Action by checking the box. p  pAt the moment, the checkboxes display properly, including the preset values from the controller, but when I press the submit button at the bottom of the form, I get this errorp  precodeSpecified cast is not valid. Description An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code.

Negative 4984 pIve been working on adapting the stacked bar chart example a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock1134768 relnofollowhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock1134768a. The problem Im having is that theresbr always outerpadding. The API lists the outer padding as a 3rd option, but omittingbr it or setting it to 0 still leaves some padding. In most cases, it isnt too bad,br but with large data sets it tends to be a huge amount of padding. For all the codebr relevant to my issue, you can check the link above. Its not very noticeable in thatbr example, but the first bar isnt drawn until about 12 pixels in larger data sets Im usingbr this can be at 100 or more pixels I want it to start at 0 pixels.p  pThanks If you need any more explanation just let me know and Ill do my best.  p  pEDIT After testing, it appears rangeBands starts at 0, but Im still not sure why the roundingbr from round bands would round as much as it did. Oh well, I can deal with using rangeBands.p

I am having trouble in retrieving the data i wanted from the two dates i selected from the date picker. once i select the 2 dates, it just keep displaying all the data out and not the dates that i have selected and i also have problem closing a connection as it gave me this error  Adding the specified count to the semaphore would cause it to exceed its maximum count.p  pThis is my codep  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e                  getting data          string startdate  stringSession[startdate]         string enddate  stringSession[enddate]          DateTime one  Convert.ToDateTimestartdate         DateTime two  Convert.ToDateTimeenddate          if two gt one                      DataSet ds  new DataSet             SqlConnection conn  new SqlConnectionData SourceIntegrated SecurityTrue             conn.Open             SqlCommand sqlcmd  new SqlCommandSELECT  FROM StudentTransactions WHERE TimeDate BETWEEN   startdate  AND   enddate , conn             SqlDataReader reader  sqlcmd.ExecuteReader             GridView1.DataSource  reader             GridView1.Visible  true             conn.Close         codepre
Negative 4984 pIm trying to create an interactive UI for a puzzle like game where I have a set width for a container and within it 6 square divs each will be 150x150px. 1 div will expand open on page load. Only 1 div can be open at a time. If you click another div then the open div must close first then all divs slide over to make room for the div you clicked to open and expand. When they slide they cannot overlap each other. When the div is expanded it will measure 300x300pxp  pAny ideas on how to get started I tried using jQuery .animate but the code got to be a mess when I went to reverse the actions of the last click before proceeding with the actions of the new click. p  pSorry for being so abstract, lemme know if there is any clarification needed. Here is what I built so far...its a lot of spaghetti code. Also Im doing this   .yellow, .blue, .black, .grey, .purple, .pmadbig, .pmadsmall, .cache.attrstyle,  just to clear everything done previously and reset the puzzle. I need it to fully reverse properly instead of just snapping back into place. p  precode                ltDOCTYPE htmlgt              lthtmlgt             ltheadgt                  ltstyle

Negative 4984 pWhen writing a batch processor in PHP as in, it will obviously have to be croned, what are the practical differences between using Gearman and simply storing data to be processed in Redisp  pMy observations thus far are that while Gearman is capable of pushing work in real time, because the PHP code only runs at intervals, using a regularly scheduled command with Redis seems more or less equivalent.p  pMoreover, it seems like using Gearman adds unnecessary complexity to the app by binding it to the Gearman librarys dispatch lifecycle.p  pAll this said, would it be right to assume that GearmanPHP offers no benefits over RedisPHP given that the batch processor will not be constantly runningp

Negative 4984 pIve recently been challenged on my view that singletons are only good for logging and configuration. And with Dependency Injection I am now not seeing a reason why you cant use your services or repositories as singletons. p  pThere is no coupling because DI injects a singleton instance through an interface. The only reasonable argument is that your services might have shared state, but if you think about it, services should be stand alone units without any shared state. Yes they do get injected with the repositories but you only have one way that a repository instance is created and passed to the service. Since repositories should never have a shared state I dont see any reasons why it also cannot be a singleton.p  pSo for example a simple service class would look like thisp  precodepublic class GraphicService  IGraphicService      private IGraphicRepository rep     public GraphicServiceIGraphicRepository rep             rep  rep           public void CreateGraphic             ...       rep.SaveGraphicgraphic       codepre  pNo state is shared in service except repository which also doesnt change or have its own state.p  pSo the question is, strongif your services and repositories dont have any state and only passed in, through interface, configuration or anything else thats instantiated the same way they then why wouldnt you have them as singletonstrongp

Negative 4984 pI am attempting to decouple my domain from my entity and opted to use AutoMapper to accomplish some of this.

Negative 4984 pMy Java application involves generating many random numbers at various places.  I am very careful to make sure my application retrieves the java.util.Random object from a factory class so that I am able to replace it with a mock object that generates a constant during unit test. But still that is not a satisfactory unit test strategy since some of the branches can only be reached if the sequence of random numbers generated is of certain pattern.p  pHow should we unit test when java.util.Random is involved but we want to control how numbers are returned in a deterministic way  It is still not very satisfactory to hard code a specific sequence of random numbers to return in my Mock java.util.Random as this also hard code the calling sequence in the unit test which is very likely to change if I add another call to retrieve a random number in some unrelated method in my application.p

Negative 4984 pWere using Spring MVC to create a web application and we support, that the users may change their desired locale in the web application. This all works fine and dandy, however we have encountered an issue which doesnt seem to be covered by Spring WebMVC or we simply dont find the part where it is. p  pWe have several forms that use an  which formats its date to yyyymmdd according to the HTML5 specification. On browsers not supporting this we use a polyfill to show a date picker. The date picker formats the date to the locale specific representation e.g. for German dd.mm.yyyy. Now when the form is sent to us we get it one time as yyyymmdd and another time as dd.mm.yyyy and even in more different formats when we support more locales later on. By default Spring MVC seems to be unable to handle this. You can specify a DateTimeFormat annotation at your form bean but this simply covers one possible format and you cannot add more than one of these annotations.p  pSo we dug a bit deeper and wrote a custom property editor for dates which tries to parse the date in different formats and returns the parsed date once a fitting format has been found. We registered this one in our controller baseclass using an InitBinder annotationp  precode InitBinder     public void initBinderWebDataBinder binder          String outputFormat  messageSource.getMessagegeneric.date.format, null, LocaleContextHolder.getLocale         binder.registerCustomEditorDate.class, new MultipleDateEditoroutputFormat, ACCEPTEDINPUTFORMATS      codepre  pThis basically gets the current locale and feeds the property editor with the date format that is suitable for the locale of the current caller. This is actually more work than I expected when using a web framework. p  pAlso there is another problem when the submitted form contains an error and we need to print the parsed date back into the form. Wed like to print the value out with the same format in which we got it. With the property editor we could solve this by remembering internally which format we used to parse the date to use this format again to format the date back into a string. Again, this looks like more work than it should be when using a web framework.p  pId love to hear your solutions to this issue. This is something that is needed in almost every web application supporting multiple languages, so there must be some standardized way or at least a best practise to do so.p

Negative 4984 pSay I have a router with IP 42.98.1.70, with 2 NiCs connected to it with IPs 192.168.1.200 and 192.168.1.300. The router has port forwarding on port 10433 to redirect packets to 192.168.1.200. The routers internal network IP is 192.168.1.100. p  pWhen NIC 192.168.1.300 sends a packet to socket 42.98.1.7010433. the host 192.168.1.200 gets a packet from socket 192.168.1.10048900, which as far as I know, looks like a hole punched socket setup by the router. p  pSo theoretically, if host 192.168.1.200 replies with a packet to socket 192.168.1.10048900, that packet should eventually get back to host 192.168.1.300, since the router should bridge the two via its internal table mapping, aka UDP hole punching. p  pHowever, the packet sent back to 192.168.1.10048900 from 192.168.1.200 never reaches 192.168.1.300. p  pim suspecting that what could be going on is that UDP hole punching doesnt work in between NICs on the same network. It only works between a source that is external to the network and one that is within it. Is that the casep

Negative 4984 pOk so Im going to explain the situation before I actually ask my question. I have two mail servers set up. One is setup for websites to use and the other is an exchange system which is the main mail system for the domain name im using.p  pBoth work fine independently, however what Id like to do, is have Exchange hand off any email address that doesnt exist in it, to a second server for processing, and if the email doesnt work on that server, it would send the rejection notice.p  pFor examplep  pstronguser1domain.tldstrong exists on the exchange server, so it would be directed there.br strongsupportdomain.tldstrong doesnt exist on the exchange server but it does exist on the second mail server.p  pIve tried this using DNS, and Ive looked into using SMTP Connectors, nothing seems to be working. It would be beneficial to have both servers working as I need one for the website to function properly and it does not work with exchange, but I dont want the emails sent from a domain that is not ours it will confuse customers. Is there a more simple way to do thisp  pSomeone please enlighten me. p  pstrong UPDATE strong I created a receive connector in exchange, and it worked for about 10 minutes, then it stopped working. So I believe Im heading in the correct direction.p

Negative 4984 pIve been reading all the other questions asking about this error and it seems like Ive followed their solutions but Im still having this problem. I removed all the existing provisioning profiles and app ids. I created a new app id that has push enabled. I created a development provisioning profile with push enabled. On the Apple dev site, that provisioning profile has a green active indicator next to it. In xcode5, under preferencesaccounts, the provisioning profile is listed. Under windoworganizer, the provisioning profile appears under my device with the status valid profile. But the error is still occurring. What am I missing here p  pEdit I want to make it clear that I created my provisioning profile AFTER creating the APNS certificate since that seems to be the most common solution to this. p

Negative 4984 pI am deploying a webapp on Tomcat, which should eventually become a platform offering several services. Sometimes I need to be able to authenticate the user with client certificates, but only when she visits some servleturl , in order to validate the certificate and read some attributes.p  pI came to the conclusion that with Tomcat and jspservlets alone, it is not possible to make only a part of the web app to request client certificate authentication. It is either the whole tomcat server that requests user certificates everytime everywhere clientAuth true or want, or web.xml authorization settings that are not useful for this scenario.p  pIs there a framework, application server, or some particular proven architecture I can use to achieve this requeriment I thought of maybe having a separate server instance dedicated to mutual ssl authentication, redirecting the user and forwarding session parameters, but this option seems rather complex to manage. I bet there are similar solutions, just wondering if there is some reference implementation, guidelines, whatever... Thanks.p

It looks like codethis.response  this.request.GetResponsecode line 395 is what is hanging, then timing out, and throwing an exception.p  pI looked at the traffic with fiddler and it looks to me like everything is okayp  pRequest p  blockquote   pGET http8091poolsdefaultbucketsStreamingsyncpuppylocalbucketuuid HTTP1.1   CacheControl nocache   Authorization Basic    Host 8091   Connection Closep blockquote  pResponsep  blockquote   pHTTP1.1 200 OK   TransferEncoding chunked   Server Couchbase Server   Pragma nocache   Date Sun, 16 Dec 2007 214924 GMT   ContentType applicationjson charsetutf8   CacheControl nocachep blockquote  pThe test cluster is running the latest version of Couchbase server version 2.5.0 enterprise edition build1059relp  pAny help would be appreciatedp  pThanksp
Negative 4984 pIm actually really new to java. Ive noticed a lot of people take on a similar task, but I cant seem to find the answer I think Im looking for. Im making a very simple Pokemon game learning purposes. Long story short, my question is about handling the abundant amount of creaturescharacte0rsobjects that need to be created.p  pThe technique Ive been using is with a pokemon superclass with setters and getters. Was wondering about xml files to store the list of 150 different pokemon each with different attribute values, but all with the same set of attributes. But it seems like that involves a lot of coding as well. I like that I can also create a class to read and write the xml file, to recieve data and potentially createchange data as well.p  pBUT, Ive seen use of a listlike sheet that basically looks something likep  pcodePikachu,12,30,20,15,Thunder Bolt,Quick Attack,electric,none,etc...codep  pcodeBulbasaur, 20,52,16,Leech Seed,Growl,plant,fire,etc...codep  pcodename,atk,def,speed,move1,move2,type,weakness,etc...codep  pWhere the different attributes of the objectpokemon are stored in a line seperated by commas. If i understand correctly, these attributes are then read by a method that needs very little coding to read the whole line, and then plugs in the values on the line to their proper variable in the object without having to restate the name of each variable.p  pIm a complete java noob, sorry if this is completly wrong. Im really just curious what this technique is called and where i can find resources for learning it. If its even a viable option for what im doing. Also curious if this techniquedatasheet is capable of being edited by java like xml is.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 4984 pIve been at this for a few hours. Im relatively new with Django and I need help in a setup that doesnt seem all that common.p  pIm serving my website with Nginx and UWSGI where most of the pages are static and not served using Django. The only reason Im using Django is for implementing a form. Therefore, I decided to SSI just the form template itself into a ltdiv within an existing HTML outside of the Django server. The form actually works great when DEBUG  True, but when False the form would render but throws an error when trying to submit. The error is Forbidden 403 CSRF verification failed. Request aborted. Reason given for failure CSRF cookie not set. Now the solutions Ive found only assume that the whole website is served by Django. However, for me, only a snippet of Django template is served using Nginxs SSI. Im wondering what the issue is and if the community can help me.

Negative 4984 pThis is more of a question where Im trying to see if my thinking is correct before I start coding something that winds up not working. Let me see if I can explain what Im trying to do first. My main issue is wanting to know if Im on the right track or not.p  pIm creating a game using the page viewer and fragments so I can have a tabbed layout. Thats not a problem. Where Im getting confused and turned around is that I have multiple activities, each handling a different part of the game so that I avoid having too much on the screen at any one time. I had wanted to have all of the game methods in a single class and have each activity pull from it. Can I do so if the class is private I assume if I had a GAME class for example that I would have to instantiate a particular version of it somewhere but if I did, how can I be sure that everything is pulling from that same instancep  pAnother approach I had thought of was basically just making one game class that did everything and then just spit out the variable values to the various activities as needed which would then update the UI. Would that be a better approach I think if I do it this way I can avoid having to pass data directly from one activity to the next. I can just have them all pull whatever values they need directly from the class.p  pDoes any of this make any sense or am I way out in left field somewhere Any direction to go in to start would be helpful as Ive been going around for days trying to chart some kind of course.p

Negative 4984 pim having an issue with how eloquent is formulation a query that i have no access to. When doing something like p  precodemodelgtwheresomething gtdistinct gtpaginate codepre  peloquent runs a query to get the total count, and the query looks something likep  precodeselect count as aggregate from ..... codepre  pThe problem is that if you use distinct in the query, you want something like p  precodeselect countdistinct id as aggregate from ..... codepre  pto get the correct total. Eloquent is not doing that though, thus returning wrong totals. The only way to get the distinct in count is to pass an argument through the query builder like so countid in which case it will add it. Problem is that this query is autogenerated and i have no control over it.p  pIs there a way to trick it into adding the distinct on the count query p  pP.S Digging deep into the builders code we find an IF statement asking for a field on the count method in order to add the distinct property to the count.

Negative 4984 pI have a very specific use case for which I am developing an application prototype. I have a USB device which for all purposes acts as a webcam capable of transferring i.e. DMA raw, fullHD RGB data to RAM. I want to render this RGB data on a screen but am constrained by the available CPU power. All this needs to happen in a Linux environment. The best solution I have so far is to use the Xvideo extension to X with a shared memory segment to efficiently allow the X server to access the image data. The only problem is that the available video adaptor only supports YUV rendering with the Xv API this works, but is not optimal, because the webcam also supports the appropriate YUV format. I have also investigated in the VA API, but that doesnt support direct RGB rendering either. So the question is whether you can think of any suitable way of doing this.p  pOpenGL is an option although I have not used it before, so some help would be appreciated as long as the solution is not too CPU hungry. The software is supposed to run on a device with an Intel Atom CPUp

Negative 4984 pIm dabbling with using PubNub for various parts of my app.  Im using their AngularJS library for this.p  pRight now, Im just testing it for doing analytics.  Basically, I want to track ever more a user makes in the app  buttons pressed, states navigated to, etc.  So, I track actions and publish on a channel.p  pIt all works great  when the user is online.  However, when offline, I lose all this tracking.  I was sort of hoping that PubNub client would automatically queue all the publish requests.  It does not seem to do this.p  pSo, Im thinking Ill have a service to collect all publish requests and put them in a queue if the device is offline.  Once the device is back online, Ill publish any queued requests.p  pIs this the best approach  Does anyone have a better suggestion  Does PubNub already have this ability and Im just not finding itp

Negative 4984 pI have a question concerning upload speed to Google Cloud Storage using resumable uploads. Ive wrote a desktop java client to upload large files to GCSit has some specialized features thats why gsutil was not an answer for my company. During tests runs about 2 months ago it was utilizing available connection bandwidth very well with about 20Mbps out of 25Mbps connection. The project was frozen for almost 2 months and now when it is reopened the same client is uploading with very poor speed at about 1.4Mbps out of 25Mbps availible. Ive wrote simple Python script to check if it will have same problems and it is a little faster but still at about 2Mbps. Gsutil tool is performing almost the same like my Python script. Ive also run the test on different network infrastructure with over 50Mbps upload speed.p  pThe results are also quite poorp  ul liJava client 2.4Mbpsli liPython script 3.2Mbpsli ligsutil 3.2Mbpsli ul  pThe only thing that have changed is the Google Cloud Storage API version.

At the moment theres no difference if Im still using depreciated API or the new one.p  pHas anyone encountered same upload speed degradationp  pWhat are your average upload speedsp  pWhat could be a possible reason of such a dramatic upload performance decreasep  pWill parallel uploads of composite objects help me to fully utilize available bandwidthp

Negative 4984 pour application currently uses a procedure that dynamically builds a large portion of the SQL statements to be executed. And this procedure is executed every weekend about 10,000 times. p  pThe Issue Recently our DBA noticed that the Soft Parse times for this procedure execution is a lot and he suggested that we use a Package that builds the sql statements once for each combination of inputs. This since there are only limited number of possible input combinations. But he was very unsure about what other parameters need to be set for this design and how caching of SQL works.p  pThe current procedure crudely looks likep  precodeProcedure P v1 IN NUMBER, v2, IN NUMBER     vtablename            VARCHAR230      vtablename  X  v1     vsql   INSERT INTO   vtablename  values..     EXECUTE IMMEDIATE vsql USING aaa      vtablename  Y  v2     vsql   SELECT abc FROM   vtablename      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE vsql     INTO bbb USING kkk END codepre  pSo based on the recommendations, the new package replacing this should look likep  precodePACKAGE BODY PK AS  vsql1 VARCHAR2   vsql2 VARCHAR2   vsql3 VARCHAR2  .... many more  PROCEDURE P v1 IN NUMBER, v2, IN NUMBER IF condition A THEN         ltConditions can occur many timesgt    IF vsql1   THEN       vsql1  INSERT INTO   vtablename ...  ltConstruct oncegt               EXECUTE IMMEDIATE vsql1 USING aaa    ELSE       EXECUTE IMMEDIATE vsql1 USING aaa    END IF END IF  IF condition B THEN    IF vsql2   THEN       vsql2  SELECT abc FROM   vtablename....  ltConstruct oncegt               EXECUTE IMMEDIATE vsql INTO bbb USING kkk    ELSE       EXECUTE IMMEDIATE vsql INTO bbb USING kkk    END IF END IF codepre  pDoes this design improve CachingExecution Plan Does it need any further modificationsadjustments to improve on our Soft Parse timesp  pAll feedback is appreciated.p

Negative 4984 pI am developing an application which is designed to display rotating media content including images, videos, web sites etc.  p  pThe application has been working correctly on Android 4.2 but when trying it on Android 4.4 I noticed that it would execute for about a 24 hours and then quit from a memory allocation exception.  It uses a VideoView which is created to play the video and then removed.  I have tried using a single VideoView which is not recreated but that does not make a difference.p  pI have determined that the probable cause for this is a thread leak in the MediaPlayer object when playing videos.  After placing lots of logging code into the application and collecting the logs I notice that the thread count is continually growing and that there are numerous threads still running the android.media.MediaPlayer1.run function.  See excerpt below which is a thread dump performed by the program and is showing in excess of 302 threads for this application after many hours of operation.p  precode[4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads300Trace information for the thread Thread[Thread1662,5,main] [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads300Thread status RUNNABLE alive true [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads300android.os.MessageQueue.nativePollOnceNative Method [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads300android.os.MessageQueue.nextMessageQueue.java138 [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads300android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java123 [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads300android.media.MediaPlayer1.runMediaPlayer.java1491 [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads300java.lang.Thread.runThread.java841 [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads301Trace information for the thread Thread[Thread1469,5,main] [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads301Thread status RUNNABLE alive true [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads301android.os.MessageQueue.nativePollOnceNative Method [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads301android.os.MessageQueue.nextMessageQueue.java138 [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads301android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java123 [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads301android.media.MediaPlayer1.runMediaPlayer.java1491 [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads301java.lang.Thread.runThread.java841 [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads302Trace information for the thread Thread[Thread1636,5,main] [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads302Thread status RUNNABLE alive true [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads302android.os.MessageQueue.nativePollOnceNative Method [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads302android.os.MessageQueue.nextMessageQueue.java138 [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads302android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java123 [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads302android.media.MediaPlayer1.runMediaPlayer.java1491 [4471]20141202 065304DEBUGlogThreads302java.lang.Thread.runThread.java841 codepre  pThis issue does not seem to happen in Android 4.2 with the same program.

Negative 4984 pI am working on an electronic gradebook program that sends an http post request from a Java SE application to a Java EE application.

Negative 4984 pIm playing with 2D graphics in OpenGL  fractals and other fun stuff . My basic setup is rendering a couple triangles to fill the screen and using a fragment shader to draw cool stuff on them. Id like to smooth things out a bit, so I started looking into supersampling. Its not obvious to me how to go about this. Heres what Ive tried so far...p  pFirst, I looked at the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationGraphicsImagingConceptualOpenGLMacProgGuideopenglfsaaopenglfsaa.html relnofollowApple docs on antialiasinga. I updated my pixel format initializationp  precodeNSOpenGLPixelFormatAttribute attrs[]       NSOpenGLPFADoubleBuffer,     NSOpenGLPFADepthSize, 24,     NSOpenGLPFAOpenGLProfile, NSOpenGLProfileVersion41Core,     NSOpenGLPFASupersample,     NSOpenGLPFASampleBuffers, 1,     NSOpenGLPFASamples, 4,     0  codepre  pI also added the codeglEnableGLMULTISAMPLEcode line. codeGLMULTISAMPLEFILTERHINTNVcode doesnt seem to be defined docs appear to be out of date, so I wasnt sure what to do there.p  pThat made my renders slower but doesnt seem to be doing antialiasing, so I tried the RendertoFBO approach described on the a hrefhttpswww.opengl.orgwikiMultisampling relnofollowOpenGL Wiki on Multisamplinga. Ive tried a bunch of variations, with a variety of outcomes successful rendering which dont appear to be antialiased, rendering garbage to the screen fun, crashes app evaporates and I get a system dialog about graphics issues, and making my laptop unresponsive aside from the cursor got the system dialog about graphics issues after hard reboot.p  pI am checking my framebuffers status before drawing, so I know thats not the issue. And Im sure Im rendering with hardware, not software  saw that suggestion on other posts.p  pIve spent a fair amount of time on it and still dont quite understand how to approach this. One thing Id love some help on is how to query GL to see if supersampling is enabled properly, or how to tell how many times my fragment shader is called, etc. Im also a bit confused about where some of the calls go  most examples I find just say which methods to call, but dont specify which ones need to go in the codedrawcode callback.

I then got rid of the code 2code multiplier, and it still drew garbage to the screen. I then turned off the codeNSOpenGLPFAcode options related to multisupersampling, and it rendered normally, with no antialiasing.p  pI also tried using a nonmultisample texture, but kept getting incomplete attachment errors.

Negative 4984 pI have a circle which i need to fill with rectangles.Piled one over the other.The rectangles are available in specific sizes only.And we are also given the number of rectangles we must put.I need to get the set of rectangle lengths which cover the most area of the circle.For eg if the circle has a diameter of 100,rectangles of lengths [100,95,90,85,...15,10,5] can be put.I have tried using a brute force method by parsing through all the possible combinations.It yields good results when the numbers are small.Another algorithm i tried is to restrict the range of lengths which each rectangle occupies.Like the first rectangle will have a length of 95 or 90 to give the best result.But even this method is cumbersome when the number of rectangles to be put is really high.Here is how the rectangles are arrangedimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGOne1.png altenter image description herep  pIf the first rectangle has a length l,and diameter of circle is d,its thickness is sqrtd2l2.The thickness of second one if its length is k is sqrtd2k2sqrtd2l2.p  pIs there any algorithm so that i can go formulate the results.p

Negative 4984 pSo Ive dynamically created several SVGRectElements in my page using d3 in the   block. Next I use jQuery to fetch the objects Ive created by their name and now I have an array of the elements Im working with. Then I create listeners for these rectangles and have them turn to a different color when Im hovering over them using mouseover and mouseout in d3. Then I make an click listener which bases the rectangles object to the function. That function looks like this p  precodefunction clickBarbar         var barnum  getBarNumbar         outputbarnum      function getBarNumbar     var bars  rect     outputbar.id bars[0].id     fori0 iltbars.length1 i              output bars[i]   bar i         ifbars[i].idbar.id             return i                          return 1          codepre  pVia output Im seeing that in fact SVGRectElements are being compared every time, except never is the index being returned. I know its a different index every time too so asynchronous problems which Ive had before cant explain the failure in this comparison. I know  is generally for primitives, but a .equals didnt result in anything different either. How do I do this comparison so that I figure out what index the bar is that I have just clickedp

Negative 4984 pI need to find the largest triangle of ones in a matrix of zeros and ones using dynamic programming. So if this is my matrixp  precode 1 0 0 1 1  0 1 1 1 1  0 1 1 1 0  1 1 1 1 1  1 1 0 0 1 codepre  pThen there are two largest triangles with the right corner at [2,2] and [4,4]. I only have to look for the right isosceles triangles which have the angles 90, 45, 45 and I also need to look at only one orientation, because all the others are symmetric. So basically I need a function which takes the matrix and returns a triangle, with triangle being an object. I dont need complete code pseudocode is fine too me. p  pFirst I thought of just using the square algorithm here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1726632dynamicprogramminglargestsquareblockDynamic programming  Largest square blocka, and when you have found the largest square, then the largest triangle must be in there. But I can easy find counter examples where this doesnt work. After that I tried to look at the upper cell and counting this with dynamic programming, but I am not sure what to do next... So my count will look like this with the matrix from abovep  precode1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 3 0 1 3 3 4 1 2 4 0 0 2 codepre  pI think have to use this in some way.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI think I am pretty close now, when you walkthrough the matrix nm and and make count[i][j]  1 mincount[i1][j], count[i][j1], so look at the left and upper cell. We get thisp  precode1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 2 2 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 4 1 1 2 0 0 1 codepre  pThis looks pretty good to me, you can the see where the right corner is of the [4,4] solution. Can anyone think of any counter examples I only I have to return one solution, so returning this solution is fine.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong I have found a counterexample, let position [4,4] be 0, we then get the following matrixp  precode 1 0 0 1 1  0 1 1 1 1  0 1 1 1 0  1 1 1 0 1  1 1 0 0 1 codepre  pCount will look like this after walking through the matrixp  precode1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 2 2 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 1 2 0 0 1 codepre  pNow it will return the triangle with right corner [3,4] third row fourth column, which is incorrect it should find [2,2]. So I thought maybe just going from the top left what we have done so far and from the right bottom and take the max from that. So count with right bottom will look like this look at the cell below and to the rightp  precode1 0 0 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 3 2 1 0 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 codepre  pNow we do find the solution of [2,2]. So I think using these methods will give me the solution, can anyone think of a better solution or a counter example for this onep  pstrongUPDATE 3strong kraskevich made me realize that we have to use this algorithm four times. From the top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right and then just take the maximum, because then you have taken all the possibilities. Anyone has a better way to do this Is this algorithm then correct So just four times the same algorithm, only an other start point in the matrixp  pAlso for the people who dont really understand what I am doing I might go a little fast take a look again at this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1726632dynamicprogramminglargestsquareblockDynamic programming  Largest square blocka the approach is very similar and it is very well explained there what there is done.p

Negative 4984 pIm designing a networking app similar to a social networking app. First, the user has to login in with Facebook, then he can join an event. To implement these features, Ive created a REST API which handles all the requests from the user on the frontend.p  pAll around the app, the user has to make numerous requests to the API. And since I wanted to make all my requests to the server completely secure, I always retrieve the UID and Access Token before making any connexion to the server. So that I can, on the serverside, easily reject requests from the user if his access token is not valid I check w the FB Graph API.p  pstrongSummarystrong  emWhen making every request, we retrieve UID and Access Token, then send it with the request to the server. The server check on his side if the token associated to UID is valid or not, and then respond.emp  pMy issue is simple, all of these requests are strongverystrong intensive networkingwise. I have to wait at least 34 seconds when making every single request which can be as small as a vote on a post.p  pHow can I be frugal with this authentication design without compromising the security of my app, knowing that the delay is mainly caused by the facebook calls inside the app p  pIf you have any suggestions, please feel free to respond, also dont avoid criticizing stronganystrong of the design choices stated above. Im always open to constructive criticism.p  pThank you .p

How can I create a script that automatically selects the images then uploads them I already know the path of each images on the clients PC. I just dont want to script a click on the file upload button since I get a headache trying to make that work. My current goal is to script it in Autoit with something likep  precodefiles1  CTeamBuildingTeam Games.jpg files2  CTeamBuildingTeam Prayer.jpg oIE.getelementbyidfile.upload files1, files2 codepre  pThen after the image upload the form is submitted. Obviously the code above is a fantasy D I just need the part to script uploading the images instead of clicking the upload button. My Autoit script will modify the innerHTML of this form to add the script for autoupload. Is this doablep  pSummary Instead of clicking the Upload File button I want a script to upload certain .jpg files. Right now what Im doing is manually clicking the Upload File button then selecting all the JPEG files. Somebody suggested a script that will click the upload button then types the path of each images but I already tried those, was a headache, Im asking for a script in VB since Autoit seem to be VBScript language. Once I get that script, what I will do is just modify the innerHTML of my companys site so instead of a plain codeltinput typefile namefile multiplegtcode it will automatically upload the pictures without having the user manually placed the picturesp

Negative 4984 pI am working on a PythonMySQL cloud app with a fairly complex architecture. Operating this system currently generates temporary files plain text, YAML and log files and I had intended to store them on the filesystem.p  pHowever, our prospective cloud operator only provides a temporary, nonpersistent filesystem to apps. This means that the initial approach with storing the temporary and log files wont work.p  pThere must be a standard approach to solving this problem which I am not aware of. I dont want to use object storage like S3 because it would extend the current stack and add complexity. But I have the possibility to install an additional, dedicated app if there is anything made for this purpose on a different server with the same provider. The only limitation is that it would have to be in PHP, Python, MySQL.p  pThe generic question emWhat is the standard approach to storing files when no persistent filesystem is availableemp  pAnd for my specific case emIs there any solution using Python andor MySQL which is simple and quick to implement Is this a usecase for Redisemp

Negative 4984 pIm relatively new to mac and now trying to setup a dev. environment for Cordova based iOS app. Im using Yosemite 10.10.3p  pIve installed xcode 6.3.1 and the commandlinetools for 6.3.1, under ApplicationsXcode.appContentsDeveloper I can see usrbin and usrlib, also xcodeselect p is pointing to this path, so I think the command line tool is fine.p  pHowever, when I run xcodebuild I got command not found. Ive manually added the path above into the PATH environment variable to make xcodebuild visible, but not sure why this is needed, I thought the installation should have taken care of this.p  pThen when xcrun was executed in certain script  npm install g iosdeploy , I got the following errorp  pdyld Library not loaded rpathlibxcrun.dylib referenced from usrbinxcrun, reason image not found.p  pI see xcrun is available in usrbin as well as in the usrbin under command line tool installation path. But the libxcrun.dylib is only available in the installation path.p  pI manually copied this dynamic library to usrlib and xcrun worked.p  pThough it seemed working but I got suspicious, such manual actions shouldnt be the normal postinstallation procedure, should they p  pIs there something I forgot to do after the command line installation What if theres more such little files I need to copymove around Can I simply specify the installation path somewhere p  pBTW, I added the install pathusrlib into PATH, but didnt work with xcrun, had to copy the .dylib.   p  pTheres other mac which the Xcode and CLT were upgraded from previous version, and there no such issue. p
Negative 4984 pWhat would be an elegant solution to proportionally scale and center an entire website to fit a browser window and updating as its resizedp  pAssume the base layout is 720x500pxp  pContent should proportionally scale to fit, and then recenter.p  pEssentially, operating like this Flash plugin a hrefhttpsiteold.greensock.comautofitarea relnofollowhttpsiteold.greensock.comautofitareaa though base size is knownp  pSite will contain several different types of elements in that 720x500 area... ideal solution would just scale the whole thing, not needing to style each individual element in case it matters images will be SVG and so scaling should have no negative affect on resolutionp

Let me try to clarify a lot here.p  pSay we have Cell1, which will hold the counting formula.  I have a list of values in a twocolumn table, Table1.  The range, Range1 that Cell1 will be counting from is a range of cells that have List Validation in them.  Table1 holds references to all values that can result from those Lists, in column 1.  I have another cell, Cell2, which holds a number value.  Column 2 of Table1 holds values that reference Cell2.  I need to count the number of values from Range1 whose row matches in Table1a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comE8yPP.png relnofollow2a match the value in Cell2.  Is there a way I can do this with COUNTIF without referencing each cell individually  Is there some shorthand like Range.currentValue that I can use to get the value of the cell currently being checked  The range is 11 rows long, and I need to do a second range that has 12 rows counted.p  pMan, I really dont know how to clarify that any more...

Negative 4984 pIt is typical to use the codewithcode statement to open a file so that the file handle cannot be leakedp  precodewith openmyfile as f      codepre  pBut what if the exception occurs somewhere emwithinem the codeopencode call  The codeopencode function is very likely not an atomic instruction in the Python interpreter, so its entirely possible that an asynchronous exception such as codeKeyboardInterruptcode would be thrown at some moment before the codeopencode call has finished, but after the system call has already completed.p  pThe conventional way of handle this in, for example, POSIX signals to use the emmasking mechanismem while masked, the delivery of exceptions is suspended until they are later unmasked.  This allows operations such as codeopencode to be implemented in an atomic way.  Does such a primitive exist in Pythonp  hr  p[] One might say its doesnt matter for codeKeyboardInterruptcode since the program is about to die anyway, but that is not true of all programs.  Its conceivable that a program might choose to catch codeKeyboardInterruptcode on the top level and continue execution, in which case the leaked file handle can add up over time.p

Negative 4984 pIm trying to run a program that will allow the user to input both a char keyCharacter and a String theString. Then, using these inputs, I will mask the keyCharacter if it occurs in theString with a , remove the keyCharacter from the theString, and finally, count the number of times the keyCharacter occurs in theString altogether. p  pEvery method is working fine, except the method getKeyCharacter where the user has to input a char The user can only enter a single letter e.g. q, or z. p  pIf the user enters anything other than that single letter which can be anything from a word, phrase, sentence, special character like  or , blank space or tabs, or just pressing enter, then the program returns the user to the original question that asks for the keyCharacter from the user. This should continue looping back to that original question until the user enters a valid input.p  pSince Im still a beginner to java and loops are my weakness so far, this part is causing me a lot of trouble. I know I should be using a while loop, it is the logic behind the nested loops that is really confusing me. p  pFrom searching for possible solutions, I know there are these things called regex and trycatch exception that could help with my issue, but since we havent gone over that explicitly in class, Id prefer not to deal with that for now.

Negative 4984 pIm trying to swap two codeintcodes  codexcode and codeycode in the example, and do it in one line without a library function.p  pSo I started with thisp  precodeint x  4 int y  3  System.out.printlnx System.out.printlny  x  y  System.out.printlnx System.out.printlny  y  x  System.out.printlnx System.out.printlny  x  y  System.out.printlnx System.out.printlny codepre  pThe output was code4, 3, 7, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4code as expected. All good so far.p  pNext up was this p  precodeint x  4 int y  3  System.out.printlnx System.out.printlny  y  x  y  System.out.printlnx System.out.printlny  x  y  System.out.printlnx System.out.printlny codepre  pThe output was code4, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4code as expected once again.

Now I know that the code0code is a result of code4  4code because the codexcode assignment wasnt complete at that time  why is this happening Why doesnt the codex  ycode actually assign code7code to the codexcode variable so that it becomes code7  4code for the last assignmentp

Negative 4984 pI am placing custom child views into a ViewPager.  I dont have any significant experience with intercepting touch events so this is all quite new to me.p  pIve looked at a large number of questions related to this on SO and other blogs, but so far none of the suggested advice has helped me too much.  p  pMy custom view has two panels which overlap one another.  I need to allow the user to swipe away the frontmost panel without passing those touch events to the parent ViewPager.p  pIm having a lot of difficulty understanding this since it seems that my views codeonTouchEventcode is always called despite returning codefalsecode when appropriate in my views codeonInterceptTouchEventcode.

is nothing happening that doesnt normally happen in a ViewPager.  My child view completely ignores the touch input.  Im sure Im doing something stupid here, but I dont have enough experience with this portion of the Android SDK to know what it is.  p  pIve tossed a codeGestureDetector.OnGestureListenercode in on the suggestion of some blog, but I havent found much use for it and dont know how it might help me to begin with.p  pCan you find something obviously wrong with my code  Am I even on the right trackp  pstrongUpdate 20150901strong Ive discovered that codeViewParentrequestDisallowInterceptTouchEventbooleancode method should probably be called on my views parent at a couple of points.  It seems like perhaps codeonInterceptTouchEventcode might be a good place to set the flag and in codeonTouchEventcode in the case for codeACTIONUPcode might be a good place to cancel it.  This is obviously not correct, since when I scroll to a page that has a front panel that the user needs to swipe away, the ViewPager stops scrolling entirely and there is no uservisible response from the app.  How can I make this workp  pWorking example app repo a hrefhttpsgitlab.comdm78ViewPagerTouchExampletreemaster relnofollowhttpsgitlab.comdm78ViewPagerTouchExampletreemasterap

It looks fine while there are not too many jobs in the flow, but if the flow is large and complicated graph seems to be less readable it doesnt go towards the right hand side of the screen, descending towards the bottom instead, which causes the arrows between jobs to intersect making one struggle to see the flow progress and connections.p  pstrongIs there a possibility to change this so that graph goes rightstrongp  pNeed use horizontal scroll bar does not scare me  the question is how can this be implemented, or rather if this can be implemented without rewriting  extending the plugin itselfp  pI do not consider a usage of different plugin as an acceptable solution to this in my case.p

I create it, insert some data, then I drop it, but I cannot understand the error or the cause of it.p  pIf you wanna ask why I am creating a temp table and dropping that at the end, there are just some business reasons and there will be some codes between them, but for now I delete all the queries but the result is the same and it does not depend on what is between the query, when I insert just one row to table, I cannot drop it anymore. I am working on it for some days, and I have no idea how to that. Any help will greatly appreciated, Thanks in advancep
