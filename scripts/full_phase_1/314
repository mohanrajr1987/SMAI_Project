Positive 314 pHow can I apply a dynamic width and height to a reactbootstrap modal window I have checked the reactbootstrap docs a hrefhttpsreactbootstrap.github.iocomponents.htmlmodals relnofollowherea but could not figure out how to do that.

Positive 314 peverybody seems to use pixels to determine screen size of a device, but it is not a good practice anymore. You can use bootstrap to create a responsive website, but it will fail on full hd screens, because a lot of pixels, dont mean big screen anymore.p  pMy example on bigger screens, I dont want website to take the entire screen and on smaller screens I do. The easy solution is to use maxwidth, but it doesnt work if a device has a full hd screen, because its small with a lot of pixels.p

Positive 314 pI have some labels and a textview that are set to be uninstalled for compact width and installed for any other size class. They are part of a cell in a tableview. Using the app on the simulator, they are correctly uninstalled for iPhone in portrait. By clicking on the cell, the app navigates to new view. Upon navigating back, with the iPhone still in portrait, the labels and text views are now visible, even though they should be uninstalled for the current size class.

Positive 314 pI am creating a landing page using the The Landing Page theme in Wordpress. a hrefhttpwww.seniorcarecompliance.com relnofollowhttpwww.seniorcarecompliance.coma The issue I am having is regarding any photos I add, either upload directly to Wordpress or using links from Photobucket, and when I add media using the Visual Editor widget in Page Builder it is not letting me resize images at all. In fact it is forcing the image size, whether I have cropped before using a different program or in Wordpress, to the largest it can go and making my images way too big. Any time I try to resize using the Media Manager whether it is Full Size, Thumbnail, or Custom nothing happens. Even if I drag the size smaller or larger in the visual editor nothing happens. And again I have tried changing the size and dimensions with Photoshop and reuploading with the new file size and still the same thing happens.p  pI have been googling all morning and havent found a solution to my problem. Maybe I am typing the wrong phrases in. I dont know.

Positive 314 pIve run into an issue where I need to communicate between a class that is a subclass of nstextfield and the view controller I am using in a cocoa swift project.p  pThe subclassed nstextfield changes the size of its frame. The field itself is within a table within the view controller. Essentially, when the nstextfield changes its frame size, I want the view controller to become aware of that. Im able to signal to the view controller that the frame has changed via the use of Nsnotification Centre where an observer in the view controller listens for the notification, that works fine. But now when that notification is triggered, I need to view controller to return to the subclassed nstextfield in order to retrieve the size of the frame. I dont believe that I can pass for example a frame size with the notification message.p  pCan anyone give me an idea as to how I retrieve the frame size of the nstextfield from within the view controllerp  pThanks for your assistance in advance.p

Negative 314 pIm developing in Java and using JUnit to test some of my methods. Some of my methods send emails. The emails are actually sent by a separate thread that is spawned. The problem is that whenever I test these methods everything goes fine except that the emails are not actually sent. Ive followed the execution through the whole stack and every method related to sending the emails is being called and executed correctly. So I tested the methods outside of JUnit and the emails send fine.p

Negative 314 pI dont use Mercurial, but id like to start, so im reading about it. The only SCM system ive used extensively is CVS. Most of what ive read about Mercurial makes sense, and sounds good. But im alternately shocked and perplexed by that way it does tags.p  pA tag is just a nickname for a changeset and by changeset we really mean the state resulting from the changeset. Cool. The mapping from tags to changeset IDs is stored in the code.hgtagscode file. Also cool. The code.hgtagscode file is versioned.p  pemWhatemp  pThis has lots of counterintuitive consequences. For instance, if i commit a changeset which i then want to tag say, the code which will form release 1.0, i have to commit again after tagging, to put the updated tag file into the repository. And if i then update to that tagged changeset at some later date, the working copy wont contain any knowledge of that tag. If i do some work, thus founding a new branch say, for bugfixes, heading towards 1.1, that branch wont have any knowledge of the tag from which it grew. Unless i copy it over manually, that is.p  pAnd as development continues both on the original trunk and my new branch, with tags being created to mark important changesets the 2.0 release on the trunk, the 1.1 and 1.2 bugfix releases on the branch, both branches will proceed in ignorance of the other branchs tags. So, if i finish working on one branch, and want to switch to some particular changeset on another say, i finish the 1.2 bugfix release, but now have to start on the 2.1 bugfix, based on 2.0, i am now stuffed. My current changeset doesnt know about 2.0p  pWhat can i dop  ul liI can ask someone whos working on the 2.x branch to read out the actual changeset ID for 2.0, and use that explicitly, but this is appalling.li liI could name my branches, as well as using tags, so that i could hop across to the head of the 2.x branch, thus learning about the new tags, and then skip back to the 2.0 tag. Assuming that branches, unlike tags, are universally visible  is that the case Even if it is, this seems clunky.li liI could maintain a single global codehgtagscode file outside the repository, and use a couple of hooks to pull in a copy on an update, overwriting the local copy, and to copy back any changes on a commit. Im not sure how this would work in a multiuser environment, where developers are pushing changes to a shared repository i might need a separate repository just for the codehgtagscode file.li liI could use local tags, which stand outside the versioning mechanism, and so avoid the whole problem. As with shared global tags, i would have to put in place a mechanism to synchronise the codelocaltagscode file between developers.li ul  pNone of these solutions seem totally great. What should i dop  pAn assumption here is that im managing branches using named branches in a single repository, rather than repositoryperbranch. Would the situation be any better if i did the latterp

Negative 314 pIm working on a class library and have opted for a route with my design to make implementation and thread safety slightly easier, however Im wondering if there might be a better approach.p  pA brief background is that I have a multithreaded heuristic algorithm within a class library, that once setup with a scenario should attempt to solve it. However I obviously want it to be thread safe and if someone makes a change to anything while it is solving for that to causes crashes or errors.p  pThe current approach Ive got is if I have a class A, then I create a number InternalA instances for each A instance. The InternalA has many of the important properties from the A class, but is internal an inaccessible outside the library.p  pThe downside of this, is that if I wish to extend the decision making logic or actually let someone do this outside the library then it means I need to change the code within the InternalA or provide some sort of delegate function.p  pDoes this sound like the right approachp

Negative 314 pI have a StackOverflowlike tagging system for a database Im working on.

Negative 314 pIm currently designing an application which I will ultimately want to move to Windows Azure.

Ideally Im wanting the components i.e. web apps and worker service to know as little as possible about each other.

Negative 314 pI have a custom built application framework written in PHP which I have been tasked to optimize. This framework is a shared codebase which loads MVC modules to provide various functionality. Each module is a directory containing multiple PHP classes for controllers and models and PHP files for views.p  pThe entire framework loads for almost all requests, including images and stylesheets. This is because the modules are designed to be self contained packages, and they may contain images, stylesheets, javascripts or other static files within them. Because of this, there is overhead in serving what would normally be a very simple request because the system has to load all the modules just to determine what modules are available from which to pull static files.p  pThe general process for handling any given URI is as followsp  ol liAll base system classes are included liA global exception handler and some global variables are set liA systemwide configuration file is read. This is a file filled with PHP statements to set config variables liA connection to the database is made liThe modules folder is scanned via opendir and each module is verified to be valid and free of syntax errors, and then included. liA second configuration file is loaded which sets up configuration for the modules liA new instance of each module is created calling its construct method and possibly creating other database connections, performing individual startup routines, etc liThe URI is examined and passed off to the appropriate modules ol  pSteps 1  7 will almost always be exactly the same. They will always perform the exact same operations unless new modules are installed or the configuration file is changed. My question is, what could be done to optimize the process Ideally, Id like some sort of way of handling multiple requests, similar to the way KeepAlive requests work. All the overhead of initializing all modules seems like a waste just to readfile a single image or css file, just to have that same overhead again to serve another request.p  pIs there any way to reduce the overhead of a framework like this I dont even know if anyone can help me without studying all the code, this may be a hopeless questionp

As overlapped IO is very efficient leaving it out is obviously an unacceptable trait which is being adressed in version 2 which is in alpha.

Negative 314 pstrongShort questionstrongp  pI have one strongCstrong domain model. It has some methods used by the stronginternal API as well as other public methodsstrong. strongI dont want to exposestrong those API methods. Im thinking of using the strongproxy pattern to hide those methodsstrong. Do you think this is a good idea Is there some design pattern to achieve thisp  pstrongLong examplestrongp  pLets say theres a robotic arm in some remote location that can be controlled by the software but can also be manually moved by some technician. It has some sensors that allow it to know which kind of object it is holding. In my project its something completely different, but Im just using this as an example. So Id have one emRoboticArmem class which contains a emRoboticHeldObjectem abstract class. emRoboticArmem lets you know which emRoboticHeldObjectem it is holding, appart from letting you move the arm. However, you cant decide to pickup and release an object. This is decided by a technician operating the robot. So it would be something likep  precode RoboticArm   heldObject             RoboticHeldObject  moveUp  moveDown  releaseObject  holdObjectRoboticHeldObject   heldObject               RoboticHeldObject  service                  RobotService codepre  pSince the implementation is quite complex, I use an external class, emRobotServiceem which actually performs the hard work. However, its not an Anemic Domain Model since its emRoboticArmem who actually uses emRobotServiceem thus has functionality and the rest of the world doesnt know anything about emRobotServiceem.p  pThe question here is emreleaseObjectem and emholdObjectem are API methods here used by emRobotServiceem only. They are called only by emRobotServiceem whenever a technician releases the object being hold by the arm or places a new object. Thus, they are called when some network event is handled by emRobotServiceem remember the arm is in a remote location, so events are received through a network. For examplep  precodeRobotServicehandleObjectReleaseEventevent   RoboticArm arm  correspondingRoboticArmevent  armgtreleaseObject  codepre  pstrongMy approachstrongp  pTo hide those methods, I would rename emRoboticArmem to emRealRoboticArmem and create a emRoboticArmem proxy classp  precode RoboticArm        the proxy   heldObject             RoboticHeldObject  moveUp  moveDown   realArm                  RoboticArm     RealRoboticArm    the real object   heldObject             RoboticHeldObject  moveUp  moveDown  releaseObject  holdObjectRoboticHeldObject   heldObject               RoboticHeldObject  service                  RobotService codepre  pSince emRoboticArmem is a proxy, RoboticArmheldObject would call realArmheldObject, RoboticArmmoveUp realArmmoveUp and so on.p  pThe emRobotServiceem would have a pointer to the emRealRoboticArmem instance, so it could call the API methods such as releaseObject. However, other parts of the application would only be able to use the methods in emRoboticArmem, since they dont have a pointer to emRealRoboticArmem. Thus emreleaseObjectem and emholdObjectem would be effectively hidden from the audience.p  pstrongThe questionstrongp  pI am not 100 sure if this is the proxy pattern or the adapter pattern. Do you think this is the proper way to model such a system Is there a better patternp

Negative 314 pI can certainly do this by iterating through results with PHP, but just wanted to know if someone had a second to post a better solution.p  pThe scenario is that I have a list of transactions.

Negative 314 pthe problem is probably simple, the post is longer than I wished, but Ive tried providing as much info and detail as possible. I didnt write this GUI app, nor designed, however like most of us Ive inherited it.p  pIt had a regular ListView, actually the app has several ListViews, not sure if that matters yet.  Because the  of items arriving to this one ListView screenform can get very large 10K I decided to convert it to virtual list, however Im experiencing some early problems.p  pOne of the biggest problems, is that the items are being populated asynchronously by hitting a button on the form.  When they arrive from servicenetworkdatabase the items are built into ListViewItems and added to someListItems which is an ArrayList.p  pIn my RetrieveVirtualItem method I need to handle both cases when the list is empty and when I already have something after the button was hit and thats when I hit the wall no pun intended  with the following line of code p  precodeif  someListItems.Count gt e.ItemIndex   codepre  pIt basically causes no idea why a call to Dispose method on the main form which results in the entire application crashing hard. BUT, it only happens when I click on the form and list. If the form is just loaded and populated it is fine..the second you left click on the mouse, BOOMp  pIt took my couple of hours to figure out that the line above was the culprit, as the call stack wasnt very apparent to point that out, and another minute to find out that codee.ItemIndexcode is the culprit.

Negative 314 pFolks,p  pHere is my problem  I am in charge of testing an enterprise web application that makes heavy use of AJAX.  I need to build a system that allows continuous running of tests without human intervention.  Currently I am mostly interested in load testing but I want the same scripts used to generate load to be used in functional tests.p  pCurrently for loadtesting I am using the a hrefhttpgrinder.sourceforge.netgrindera.  We record scripts and then process the heck out of them to handle among other things the asynchronous requests.  This system works for now however the scripts are delicate and I cant maintain them during our development cycle.  I need to be able to run a browser via a programming language that abstracts over the details of html and javascript but it must be headless.  In other words if my testing script breaks it must represent an actual breakage of the application. Running firefox in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiXvfbxvfba does not work as firefox still uses too much resources even on a headless linux machine running with a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiXvfbxvfba.  I tried driving firefox with webdriver under the headless x server.p  pI have been working on a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHtmlUnitHTMLUnita for days since this is the ideal solution.  I have been writing a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHtmlUnitHTMLUnita drivers in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiJythonJythona and hence I can use them with the grinder.  Unfortunately I am running into javascript errors that are not real errors in firefoxchromeIE and I think I am at the end of the road for this.  In any case I am well aware of a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHtmlUnitHtmlUnita and I really need an alternative.p  pI know there are some other solutions a hrefhttpwww.envjs.comenvjsa and a hrefhttpzombie.labnotes.orgzombie.jsa however I dont know how developed these technologies are and I dont want to waste another week going down a dead end. p  pHow hard would it be to take the source code for either Firefox or Webkit and comment out all the renderingGUI calls and create a real headless browser  Has this been done  Would one be easier to do this with than another  Honestly I cannot fathom why this has not been done already, so I am guessing it is much harder than I am anticipating.p  pI am assuming that if I can get a truly headless browser with reasonable performance characteristics I have a large server fleet to throw at this problem, but its not big enough for real firefox with GUI rendering then I will be set.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 314 pIve inherited two fairly nontrivial codebases that uses spring for configuring the applications. Now I need to reconfigure the applications. But lots of the configuration is provided through autowiring so it is almost impossible to find out what the actual configuration is.  p  pThe projects are moderately sized, some 20ish maven modules per project including  integration test modules and such. Most modules define a few application contexts for various purposes, that contain one or two local spring config files along with one or two from the core modules it depends on. The result is a myriad of configurations, and that I cannot alter a class or variable name or setter method without risking breaking dependencies in some upstream or downstream module, even if no such dependency is visible anywhere in the project. p  pHow do I work effectively with autowired dependencies in springp  pCan anyone, perhaps someone who actually likes autowiring, provide some insight into how you work with them effectivelyp  pI also inherited a small project that combines xmlfiles, autowiring and annotationdriven config, making dependency relations completely intractable, but Ill save those annotations for a separate question laterp

Negative 314 pDisclaimer I have little experience with linq.p  pOne of my tasks at my work is to maintain an e commerce web site.

I even tried putting both of the calls to codeloader.loadcode in the same function, using a random number generator to create an id on the flex side because rails needs to know that the two calls are for the same car, and without chaining I cant use the response from the first call to pass back the car id, but I ran into a race condition where the second call somehow got to the server before the first one.

Negative 314 pIve been working with images in the frequency domain by taking the DFT or FFT of an image and I know that convolution in the space domain is multiplication in the frequency. p  pSo my question is, if I wanted to apply a specific kernel lets say a 9x9 smoothing kernel in the space domain, I would just convolve the whole image by the 9x9 filter.  Now, if I wanted to do the same thing in the frequency domain, do I take the FFT of both the image and the kernel  Then howwhat do I multiply  After I have that new set of data image multiplied by kernel, I just reverse the direction of the FFT and that should give me the same result as the kernel convolved with the image in the space domain, rightp  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 314 pI have a very very strange problem and I am without a clue as to why its happening. Simply enough I have a class which stores an NSString and an NSURL. There can be many of these classes so I store them in a  mutable array.p  pThis array is used to populate a tableview. When a user hits a table cell I get one of the list classs from the array, get its URL property, and pass that to a detail view. This works fine 99 of the time but the other 1 of the time the URL property that Im passing sometimes has become released.p  pSpecifically in the debugger the NSURL says invalid summary and its urlstring property says p  pIve commented out every place that I release the NSURL. Oddly enough the NSString variable in the same class does not suffer from the same unwanted behavior.p  precode list data interface ListData  NSObject      NSURL URL     NSString Title    propertynonatomic,retain NSURL URL propertynonatomic,copy NSString Title  end  import ListData.h   implementation ListData synthesize URL synthesize Title  voiddealloc      [URL release]     [Title release]       [super dealloc]   end   table delegate method   voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      ListData rldnil      rld[listDataArray objectAtIndexindexPath.row]      if self.listView          [remixView closeRemix]          [self.listView release]         self.listViewnil            occassionaly the value of rld.URL is being released somehow     self.listView  [[ListView alloc] showWithDatarld.URL ]       self.listView.title  rld.remixTitle      [table.navigationController pushViewControllerlistView animatedYES]    population of list array  listArray [[NSMutableArray alloc]init]   while listelementnil        listData rld  [listData alloc]      [rld setURL[NSURL URLWithString[TBXML textForElement[TBXML childElementNamedurl parentElementlistelement]]]]     [rld setTitle[TBXML textForElement[TBXML childElementNamedtitle parentElementlistelement]]]      [listArray addObjectrld]      [rld release]     listelement  [TBXML nextSiblingNamedlist searchFromElementlistelement]  codepre  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pI think I found the problem but I dont really understand whats going on.p  pIn the listview showWithData method I was passing in a url and assigning it to a nsurl var of listview like this.p  precodeid showWithDataListData  data       if   [super init]            baseURLdata.URL  codepre  pbaseURL was being released somehow in the bowels of TBXML I think and this was making the NSURL from the parent tableview class be released.p  pI changed the showWithData method to the following and the problem has ceased to occur. It seems that using copy protected the original NSURL from being released. I dont understand it though because when I check in the debugger both the NSURl being passed to the method and the baseURL var both have the same memory address.

Negative 314 pI want to sort a XML file with LINQ. The XML is below and is only an example. Normally it is much bigger and more complex. The XML should be sorted by title, ascending. Not the whole XML at once, but every parentNode for itself. Leafs are always at the bottom. Folder or nonleafs are at the top. The following XML is already well structured, but the titles are in the wrong order. The sort algorithm should also replace wrong positioned nonleaf nodes. I have already some code which does the job, but I want to know if there is a more elegant or a shorter way. At the moment I have to call a function recursive to make the traversion. Maybe this can be done in another way.

Negative 314 pIm new to entity framework. I used other data persistence layers before, and would like to accomplish the following things Im used to, in the other applications I developed. And Id like to ask if its possible with EF and get few guidelines on how to do p  pI would like that every time I save an entity to database Add  Update, to have a hook where I can attach, through Provider pattern, various functionalities which have to be invoked before  after save, in a transactional way. For example, I might want to implement a AuditProvider. This will be called if the entity being saved implements an Interface, IAuditEnabled, which adds properties SysAddUser, SysAddDate, SysUpdateUser, SysUpdateDate which allow to set which user added  updated record, and at what moment. Another functionality would be to call a BusinessEntityEnforcerProvider, which check if business objects implements IBusinessEntityEnforcer interface and calls method EnforceBusinessRules. Just few thoughts.p  pJust to clarify, I want to have the possibility to hook various functionality to business object before  after save, which I dont want to call specificaly, but to make sure they are always called before  or after BO is to be saved.p  pI appreciate any suggestion.p  pThank youp

The setup is thisp  ul licodeapp.flacode, which has an attached ActionScript class, codeAppMain.ascodeli licodeskin.flacode, which contains UI componentsli ul  pcodeAppMain.ascode will obviously contain all of the applications logic I then want to be able to affect the UI components contained within the loaded skin file based on instance names defined in that particular skin.p  pSo for example, if I have  a codeTextFieldcode with an instance name of codemyTextFieldcode Id like to be able to set the codetextcode property of that text field programmatically in codeAppMain.ascode.p  pThe exported codeapp.swfcode to load a skin file based on a codeflashvarcode parameter would be loaded into an HTML document that looked like thisp  precodelthtmlgt     ltheadgt       lttitlegtTestlttitlegt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt       ltdiv idswfgtltgtltdivgt       ltscript srcjquery.jsgtltscriptgt       ltscript srcswfobject.jsgtltscriptgt       ltscriptgt           document.readyfunction                swf.flash                   swf app.swf,                   width 550,                   height 400,                   flashvars                        skin skin.swf                                                    ltscriptgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThis simply loads codeapp.swfcode into the codeswfcode codeltdivgtcode. Any help on how to get the skin SWF into my main app SWF would be grateful. I currently have the following which does not work.p  precodepackage      import flash.display.Loader     import flash.display.MovieClip     import flash.net.URLRequest      public class AppMain extends MovieClip              public function AppMain                      var myLoaderLoader  new Loader             self.addChildmyLoader             var myRequestURLRequest  new URLRequestskin.swf             myLoader.loadmyRequest                   codepre  pThe skin Im trying to load is simple in that it has a red background so I can see if its been loaded or not its not as my HTML page where Im exporting to still has a white background.p  pDo I have an error above The console in Flash Professional CS5 is not giving me any errors under the Compile Errors tab.p
Negative 314 pMy website has a wysiwyg editor logged in users save text to an SQL database.p  pWhen I retrieve this text later there are occasional malformed characters. For instance an HTML bullet point which I suspect is an codeltulgtcode and codeltligtcode tag  comes out as a question mark in a black diamond.p  pIs the wysiwyg editor spitting out bad code  I did use nicEdit I know tinyMCE is better, but nicEdit is really lightweight.  Ill switch if I have to.p  pOr should I run the text through some kind of filter function p  pMy pages are build w PHP any idea how I can fix this bugp
Negative 314 pI already have an application on App Store. Im now finishing the LITE version of this application. The way I created the LITE version was to copy the FULL version project and change the relevant features so they match what I want to have in the LITE version. I also changed the Project Name from AppName to AppName Lite. I also created in the Provision Portal new App ID, Provision and Distribution Profiles, downloaded the Certificates and dropped them on the XCode icon.p  pThe LITE version runs perfectly on Simulator and on Device. Now I wish to create this strongipastrong file so I can upload it via Application Upload. but... I get an error saying strongCode Sign error The identity iPhone Distribution doesnt match any identity in any profilestrongp  ol liIf anyone had simliar scenario, please share what you did to solve it.li liIf anyone knows of a good TUTORIAL explaining all the related steps required to upload an App to App Store and please please please dont share a link directing to Apple Provision Portal, following it caused all the confusion I have now, maybe something that also explains the rational behind their longweirdunintuitive process. li ol  pthanks...p

Negative 314 pI know there are stark differences in performance between the iOS simulator running on a desktop and the device.  However, does anyone know what kind of difference this or other settings has on gesture recognitionpassingp  pI have a few different gestures setup on overlayed UIScrollViews I know, problems abound in order to achieve complex pagingscrolling behaviours.  I have singlefinger dragging scrolling up and down, and twofinger dragging paging left and right.  My gestures and the interaction between the UIScrollViews is flawless on the iOS simulator.  However, on the device it seems that things like twofinger drags are emusuallyem being registered as two singlefinger events instead.  About 1 in 10 will work as it should.  I can elaborate on the scrollviews if necessary, but as it works seemingly perfect on the simulator I suspect this to be a simulator vs. device problem.  However Ive not found much information on how gestures are recognized and passed, and always assumed something like that would be similar on both devices.p  pNormally Id blame error in my fingers movement in relation to the exactness of the simulators touch points, but theyre not exactly complex gestures...p  pThanks for any and all help.p

Negative 314 pSo Ive been having trouble with laying out some things in IB.  I deleted my old .xib completely, and dropped in a new one.  To make sure everything was clean, all I did was add a label at the bottom.  I run my project, and it still runs the old project in the simulator to the last state of my .xib before I deleted it.  I tried the reset settings in the iOS simulator as well as cleaning my XCode project, and then rebuilding.  I still get the same .xib.  Any thoughts  Thanks.p

Negative 314 pI am on project team that is maintaining a few legacy VB6 applications. These applications are installed in over 600 customers worldwide mostly in the USA. These applications all connect to a database back end but the problem is that the SQL Login ID and password are hard coded inside of the application. With these projects we are using ODBC API to connect to the database.p  pWhat we would like to do is to provide a way for the users to set their own SQL Login ID password. We have thought of using Active Directory Authentication but we have dismissed this idea due to the fact that a user would be able to connect to the database using MS AccessExcel or Crystal Reports.p  pWe are currently working on an idea where we would store the encrypted Login ID in either a INI file or in the registry but we are not liking these solutions at all.

Negative 314 pI have such a conception, to build a  simple web application using some phpmysql hosting service. Id also like to create a local version of that app. The local version should work similarly as the online one i.d. using browser as the ui and have the ability to communicate with the server. I want it to be as lightweight as possible. p  pProfessionally, Im a c.net programmer. I also have some experience with  cc,javascript, python and java. I know very little about php, and honestly, I dont like the feeling  coding in that language, hence, dont have much willingness to dig into it. .Net, python or java theyre all too unwieldy, I cant force the users to install any of them. So I thought about haxes multitargeting. If I were to code the project in haxe it seems pretty straight forward to learn, for some one with my background, I might use the same logic on both side of the server and the client, by targeting both php and neko. p  pAs a novice, I have some doubts. Im not sure if haxe for php alreadly mature enough for this kinda job. I know haxe is a cousin of ActionScript, it primarily targets AS, and because the author is also the inventor of nekoVM, therefore, these two targets should be fine. But uh, how about php Is it really good for that as well Any hints or suggestions Is haxes builtin libraries ok for a simple web app or should I use a framework Does neko have a httpRequest functionality at allp  pMuch gratitude in advance. p

This means it is a pathing issue with it finding the XMLElement from the JDKs bootclasspath instead of finding it first in the dependencies list before looking in the JDK classes.p  pThe source files build fine in Eclipse, where it seems to put the dependencies before the JDK classes.p  pI have tried using codecompilerArgumentscode and either codebootclasspathcode or codeXbootclasspathpcode in the pom.xml to pickup the jaxbapi jar file before the jdk classes, but neither seems to include it with the command line options when I build with codemvn X clean compilecode. I also tried to change which mavencompilerplugin version it used, but from the codeXcode it didnt change it.p  pI created a stripped down project to demonstrate the error. You should only need the first two files to replicate. The other files are included as a working sample assuming the build works that exposes a web service using a standalone jetty web service and spring.p  pCXFMavenText.javap  precodepackage cxfmaventest

Negative 314 pI have a codeVideoViewcode playing video at the center of the screen.After sometime, a msg view will pop up.p  pThe position for this msg view is part of the view is inside the codeVideoViewcode area which means this part actually is overlapped with the codeVideoViewcode while the other part is outside range of the codeVideoViewcode area. p  pMy problem is I found out that when the msg view pops up, the part which is outside the codeVideoViewcode area will be shown immediately, however the other part, i.e.the part that is  overlapped with the codeVideoViewcode is shown around 1 sec later.p  pI have no idea why it is so and how to solve this issue. p
Negative 314 pI have written some code that works great, but I dont understand why it works. I want to serialize a class, with lets say an integer. So here is the code of the class.p  precode[Serializable] public class TestClass      public int Variable  codepre  pNow I want to have the possibility to create an instance of this class and setting the codeVariablecode right away. So I create a constructor and also a private default constructor for the serializer.p  precode[Serializable] public class TestClass      public int Variable      private TestClass       public TestClassint value              Variable  value            codepre  pSo in the code where Im using this, default parameters become handy. So I applied that technique to the public constructor.p  precode[Serializable] public class TestClass      public int Variable      private TestClass       public TestClassint value  0              Variable  value            codepre  pAnd this all works fine, but why Do we dont have now two constructors with the same definition Even if I make the default constructor public, everything works fine. Once I remove the default constructor, it fails on serialisation. My first guess is that the XmlSerialize of .NET doesnt check for constructors with default parameters. But why does the compiler still allows this codep  pIm just curious on this, but also hope to learn and better understand how things work internally. Googling doesnt bring up anything useful, maybe just because I couldnt think about the right search terms.p

Im thinking of a userland software rather than hardware solution.p  pI want to produce PWM signals lets say for a small number of digital GPIO pins, but more than 1. I would probably write a program which created a Pthread, and then infinitely looped over the duty cycle with appropriate codesleepcodes etc in that thread to get the proportions right.p  pWould this not clobber the CPU horribly I imagine the frequency would be somewhere around the 100 Hz mark. Ive not done anything like this before but I can imagine that the constant looping, context switches etc wouldnt be great for multitasking or CPU usage.p  pAny advice about CPU in this case use and multitasking FWIW Im thinking of a singlecore processor. I have a feeling answers could range from emthat will make your system unusableem to emthe numbers involved are orders of magnitude smaller than will make an impact to a modern processoremp  pAssume C because it seems most appropriate. p  pEDIT Assume Linux or some other general purpose POSIX operating system on a machine with access to hardware GPIO pins.p  pEDIT I had assumed it would be obvious how I would implement PWM with sleep.

Negative 314 pI am working on a web service, that can be accessed by web site and by mobile clients without permanent internet connection.p  pThe idea is to have synchronized database on the internet and also on all clients. When the user changes data on a mobile client, it is flagged as changed in local db. When the user updates data on a website, the changeset in online DB is increased. After the synchronization, the clients remember changeset of their actual data. The problem is, when I change the data on one client, and then on another client and then I trigger the syncronization, the web server does not know, which data are the last.p  pHere is an example how it currently worksp  ol liLets say that everything is synchronized on the beginning.  data is Ali liFirst client changes the data and flags it as changed.  data is changed to B in client local dbli liSecond client changes the data and flags it as changed  data is changed to C in local dbli liFirst client goes online and updates the online database text is now B. The changeset in online DB is increased.li liSecond client goes online, detects new changeset in online DB and downloads new data local C is rewritten with online B text is now Bli liEverything is now synchronized, but text is B instead of Cli ol  pI think the problem is in step 6. The client knows, that there is both a local and an online change, but it is not able to decide what is the correct value.p  pCould you please help me, how to solve this problem I was thinking about timestamps instead of changesets, but I can not ensure that all clients have correct time.p  pPS The server runs WCF service with MSSQL and clients are ASP.NET website and Andorid and WP7 smartphones. It is not able to save any information about clients in online db. I expect the client synchronization to be run  once a day.p  pI hope my question is understandable  Thanks.p

Negative 314 pI need some suggestionsp  pI have been given a mandate to design and implement a system that will allow customers to submit orders upload. The orders will be submitted in batches multiple at a time Basically each order can be look at as a record row. The fields are either free text, numeric, or a selection form predefined text values dropdown list style. p  pFirst i need to define a standard for the data. What the fields are and the type of data that is excepted. The fact that the majority of the data are predefined text values gives me a issue p  pThen i need to determine how that data is to be transferred. What medium and protocol is used   p  pSo this is what i got so farp  p1 xml     i can use a XSD to define the data standard. This will allow validation on the     clients end. But the predefined values can change so the xsd must be generated dynamically   the client can then upload the xml. I phrase the xml into objects and persist it to my dbp  p2 have them use a delimited text file. I must provide them with a document on the data stranded. Here i cant validate until i try to read the file so i can except a lot of errorp  pThese are the two options i came up with.  I was wondering if there are any other methods or solutions to thisp  pI am developing in grails p

Negative 314 pIm working with two entities codeItemcode and codeAttributecode, which look something like the followingp  precodeItem  itemId  Attribute  attributeId name codepre  pAn codeItemcode has codeAttributescode, as specified in an association tablep  precodeItemAttribute  itemId attributeId codepre  pWhen this data gets to the client, it will be displayed with a row per codeItemcode, and each row will have a list of codeAttributecodes by name. For examplep  precodeItem  Attributes    1     A, B, C 2     A, C 3     A, B codepre  pThe user will have the option to sort on the codeAttributescode column, so we need the ability to sort the data as followsp  precodeItem  Attributes    3     A, B 1     A, B, C 2     A, C codepre  pAt present, were getting one row of data per codeItemAttributecode row. Basicallyp  precode  SELECT Item.itemId,          Attribute.name     FROM Item     JOIN ItemAttribute       ON ItemAttribute.itemId  Item.itemId     JOIN Attribute       ON Attribute.attributeId  ItemAttribute.attributeId ORDER BY Item.itemId codepre  pWhich produces a result likep  precodeitemId  name    1       A 1       B 1       C 2       A 2       C 3       A 3       B codepre  pThe actual codeORDER BYcode clause is based on user input. Its usually a single column, so the ordering is simple, and the appside loop that processes the result set combines the codeAttributecode names into a commaseparated list for presentation on the client. But when the user asks to sort on that list, itd be nice to have Oracle sort the results so that  using the example above  wed getp  precodeitemId  name    3       A 3       B 1       A 1       B 1       C 2       A 2       C codepre  pOracles codeLISTAGGcode function can be used to generate the attribute lists prior to sorting however codeAttribute.namecode can be a very long string, and it is possible that the combined list is greater than 4000 characters, which would cause the query to fail.p  pIs there a clean, efficient way to sort the data in this manner using Oracle SQL 11gR2p

Negative 314 pThis is about OSX  iOS is irrelevant to me. I have created an NSButton in InterfaceBuilder and set its bezel to Radio. The button is not checked by default. In my application I can check it of course but when clicking it again it wont be unchecked  as radio buttons usually arent.p  pNow my question is is it possible to get the NSButton with a bezel of Radio which seems to fix the type to Radio, too to act like its type was Switch instead the type Switch cant be selected when the bezel is Radio so I assume this will have to done by code. p  pThe question is not if this makes sense to do  It is if it can be done and by what means.p  pbEDIT b When selecting bevel Radio and then setting type to Push On Push Off or On Off in Interface Builder the bezel switches to Bevel for the button but the radio button appearance stays nonetheless as long as one does these changes in that order and touches nothing else afterwards. The button works as on  off, too.  However there is one difference to the original Radio bezel I try to get.

The left sidebar is set to be the same, but changes opacity of the div and img.p  pI designed it this way as the client wanted to see what both look like before coming to a decision which one to keep. Once that decision is made it will just be one or the other, so I need to get the right sidebar fixed upp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langen xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gt lttitlegtGiterman Designslttitlegt      ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstyle.cssgt    ltscript typetextjavascriptgt function changeOpacityelm, value     elm.style.opacity  value  100    elm.style.MozOpacity  value  100    elm.style.KhtmlOpacity  value  100    elm.style.filter  alphaopacity  value      elm.style.MsFilter   progidDXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alphaopacity  value    ltscriptgt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt  lt Left Side Hover over Div, DivImage shifts opacity gt ltdiv idleftNav classsidebar onMouseOverchangeOpacitythis, 70 onMouseOutchangeOpacitythis, 20gt     ltimg srcimageleftNav.png idleftButton classarrow altgtltdivgt  lt Right Side Hover over Div, Image shifts opacity gt        ltdiv idrightNav classsidebar2 onMouseOverchangeOpacityrightButton, 70 onMouseOutchangeOpacityrightButton, 20gt     ltimg srcimagerightNav.png idrightButton classarrow altgtltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pand the CSSp  precodebody background urlimagebg.jpg norepeat center center fixed webkitbackgroundsize cover mozbackgroundsize cover obackgroundsize cover backgroundsize cover  divleftNav positionabsolute left0  divrightNav positionabsolute right0   Left Sidebar  .sidebar background000000 width 55px height 100 top0 opacity0.20   Right Sidebar  .sidebar2 background urlimagebar.png repeaty width 55px height 100 top0   Needed to seperate arrow opacity for Right Sidebar attempt  rightButton opacity 0.20  img.arrow position absolute top 50 left 50 margin 0 0 0 35  codepre

Negative 314 pIm developing a codeRichTextEditorcode that user can add images that I transform to base64 and after insert in codeHTMLcode. When the User insert about 10 images, the DOM consumes a lot of memory to open and show the content. The problem is I see that ARC dont free all this content when I pop the codeRichTextEditorcode codeViewControllercode, making this way the memory continue allocated. I dont know what is the problem. If I open about 2 instance of this codeRichTextEditorcode, one to each different HTMLs, the memory uses grow up, and the app crashs. I dont know how free the memory uses of this content, I thinked that ARCs does it.p

Negative 314 pSo Ive been working on a project that allows me to add tabs to a tab control and within each new codeTabItemcode. I have a bunch of programmatically generated controls.

As per my current approach, adding codeTabItemcode programmatically works but makes editing the template a little more cumbersome and, what I believe, contrary to the philosophy of WPF disconnecting code from design.p  pIm rather new to WPF but already see the power and advantages to it over WinForms so Im sold on that avenue but because Im new, my terminology is sometimes a bit confusing, which also makes my attempts to search fail, from time to time.p  pAny help would be appreciated.

Negative 314 pDoes anyone had the experience with color matching and frametoframe tracking of it video when the exposure settings and white balance are constantly changingp  pIm working on color tracking app that uses iPad 2 frontal camera to capture video. I need to detect colored objects of predefined color we took earlier on each frame. My problem is that the camera software are like to adjust WB and Exposure each frame. So if we remember one color at frame N, on N10 frame the WB will be different and this can lead to big difference in color.p  pFor calculating color distance Im using strongLABstrong color space and strongCIE76strong formula img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3bJGG.png altenter image description herep  pYes, i know there is much better CIEDE2000 distance function, but Im working with ARM processor and Im afraid this formula will be too heavy even for ARM NEON manually optimized assembly code that i use already. p  pCIE76 provides a good results in general, but in poor or very bright lighting scenes the camera either generate too much noise or oversaturate the image so the colors becomes too far from their original. In addition to simple thresholding using color distance i implemented percomponent thresholding of LAB pixel values based on standard deviation of the calibrated color. This had also increased correctness of the detection, however, this isnt solving the main issue.p  pThe camera itself provide frames in RGB color space, but the API doesnt provide functions to get white point or color temperature of the current frame. Currently i assume D50 illuminant to  perform RGB  LAB conversion.p  pAnd this is the my main doubt. strongMy idea is to compute the white point of the given RGB image, and then convert it to XYZ color space and then convert XYZ to LAB using calculated white point.strong Is it possible p  blockquote   pstrongFrom Wikipedia White Pointstrongp      pExpressing color as tristimulus coordinates in the LMS color space, one can translate the objects color according to the von Kries transform simply by scaling the LMS coordinates by the ratio of the maximum of the tristimulus values at both white points.

Negative 314 pI am developing an ASP.NET website in which I have some tables of data. I want to generate images of this data, so that I can display those images on forums for example. The method I have used in the past is quite simple I create a System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView control yes, winforms control in memory, style it, load some columns and rows, and then use its DrawToBitmap method to generate an image basically a screenshot of the control.p  pExamplep  precode    private static Image WriteGridListltobject[]gt data              var grid  new DataGridView         grid.Columns.AddColumn 1, Column 1           grid.Columns.AddColumn 2, Column 2          grid.Columns.AddColumn 3, Column 3                   Ensure columns are large enough to display all data         grid.AutoSizeColumnsMode  DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnsMode.AllCells          foreach var row in data             grid.Rows.Addrow                   var width  GetWidthgrid         var height  GetHeightgrid          grid.Width  width         grid.Height  height          var bmp  new Bitmapwidth, height         grid.DrawToBitmapbmp, grid.Bounds         bmp.SaveUtil.Server.MapPathImagesgrid.png, ImageFormat.Png         return bmp      codepre  pThis works really well, however I am having trouble calculating the size of the image I should generate, as well as the size of the DataGridView control itself. By default, it is 100x100 I think which therefore cuts out most of the data, which is useless for image generation since you cant scroll the image obviously...p  pSo I want to calculate the width and height that the DataGridView should be so that it can display all data without scrollbars. p  pI thought this would be pretty simple loop through the columns and add up their Width property to get the total width, then loop through the rows and add their Height property to get the total heightp  precode    private static int GetWidthDataGridView grid              int width  0         foreach DataGridViewColumn col in grid.Columns                      width  col.Width                  return width           private static int GetHeightDataGridView grid              int height  grid.ColumnHeadersHeight         foreach DataGridViewRow row in grid.Rows                      height  row.Height                  return height      codepre  pHeres where the trouble comes in though... The Width property of each column always returns 100, which I am assuming is the default MinimumWidth of the column rather than the actual width of the column. Therefore with three columns my grid is always 300 pixels wide, even if the columns are actually much wider than 100 pixels each.p  pI am guessing its caused by the fact that Im creating the grid in memory rather than actually drawing it to some Form I believe this should work, but for some reason whatever I do the column widths are always 100... This makes my entire idea useless because I have no way to calculate the necessary width of the grid and image. I suppose I could measure all the strings of data in each column and basically resize them manually, but Id really rather not... There must be a better wayp  pWhat am I doing wrong Thanksp

Negative 314 pMy WinForms C.NET application requires a tablegrid control to display records to the end user.  The records will be simple, containing only two fields, a string and a datetime field.  I need to persist the data and I am wondering what the most efficient control and storage backend is to use.  The data is noncritical i.e.  not health or financial records, or anything sensitive requiring extensive safety or any encryption.p  pOne solution I have found so far is the DataGrid control in conjunction with SQL Server Compact Edition.  I learned about this solution from this tutorialp  pa hrefhttpwww.dotnetperls.comdatagridviewtutorial relnofollowhttpwww.dotnetperls.comdatagridviewtutorialap  pIt seems though that this may be overkill for my application.

Negative 314 pIm trying to build a chess game in C.  p  pI have a base class gamePiece and a derived class rook.  My original idea was to create a vector of gamePiece objects and insert all of the different types of gamePieces rooks, queens, pawns inside there.  As I found out in my last question, I cant do that  the gamePiece vector only takes base class i.e. gamePiece objects.p  pHowever, smart pointers and other techniques were suggested.  I will try that soon.p  pBut Im still curious as to why the technique below wont work. What if I instead create a vector of pointers to gamePieces, and then attempt to store pointers to my derived objects inside that vectorp  precodevectorltgamePiece gt vectorOfPointersToGamePieces   vectorltgamePiece gtiterator itOfPointersToGamePieces codepre  pFor example, suppose I insert a pointer to a rook object inside the above vector at the first location.  Initially what I thought might work was this strategyp  precodevectorOfPointersToGamePieces.pushback amprook1, Rook, A, 1, White, Up    itOfPointersToGamePiecesvectorOfPointersToGamePieces.begin       itOfPointersToGamePieces.displayPieceInfo codepre  pThe constructors appear to run fine, everything initializes.  But when it comes time to display the values of the data members onscreen with cout, the variables appear to be emptyunitialized.  Its like they disappeared.    p  pMy second crack at it was to try to dynamically cast the rook pointer to a gamepiece pointer before inserting it in the vector, like this.p  precodevectorOfPointersToGamePieces.pushback dynamiccast ltgamePiece gt amprook1, Rook, A, 1, White, Up     codepre  pBut that yielded the exact same output as above.  EmptyUnitialized variables.p  pOn my third attempt, I took a step back and tried a simpler operation.  Here, I tried to insert a pointer to a gamePiece in the vector instead of a pointer to a rook.p  precodevectorOfPointersToGamePieces.pushback ampgamePiece1, Rook, A, 1, White, Up  codepre  pThere were issues with even this third operation Only some the variables I initialized in the constructor were retained when I attempted the display operation  p  precodeitOfPointersToGamePiecesvectorOfPointersToGamePieces.begin     itOfPointersToGamePieces.displayPieceInfo codepre  pMore specifically, the ints, and the char were retained and displayed properly.  But the strings were empty and disappeared.p  pAnyone have any ideas as to why my strategy isnt workingp

Negative 314 pI have transfered my eclipse project from my pc to a laptop. It is a java 3d project, and it should show the main frame with some buttons on the buttonbar at the top, and on the rest of the screen the display of a codeSimpleUniversecodebr What happens is that all the button stuff is displayed, but not the actual java 3d thing, the usual black of the codeSimpleUniversecode and all the interactions supposed to be available are not. Instead, there is just everything gray inside the frame.br   Now the wierd thing comes along. When I do a command from the buttons which modifies in any way the codeBranchGroupcode atached to the codeSimpleUniversecode, everything is back to normal, all functions work.  I think this might be due to the fact that I detach the codeBranchGroupcode, do the required changes and then attach is back. But still, the question remains.. Why does not is work properly in the first place  p  pP.S. All the libraries are included and the laptop works better than the PC, has better video card, 1Gb RAM more and a better processor, so I dont think it is a hardware problemp

Negative 314 pIve been bashing my head against this for a few days now and cannot for the life of me figure out what is going on. Im pretty green with Core Data, but I know it well enough to avoid deadlock scenarios. However for this project I decided to try and incorporate AFIncrementalStore. I built a sample project to test the APIClient in order to map keysvalues appropriately without messing with my actual project. It worked flawlessly.p  pNow Im using it in my actual project and things are finicky. The NSFetchedResultsController is used in a UITableViewController that gets pushed off screen slide in menu similar to Facebook app. About 50 of the time I dont get a deadlock. Ive made sure that the NSFetchedResultsController managedObjectContext is the same as my AppDelegate. Nearly everything is setup identical to the AFIncrementalStore examples. Even my sample project to test out the usage works perfectly. p  pHere is an image of the Debug Navigator when I pause during the deadlock. It looks like the problem lies between AFIncrementalStores background context and the main threads context. However Im not sure what to do since I didnt write AFIncrementalStore and am just going off of the existing docsexamples.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXVA2L.png altDebug Navigatorp  pedit Adding the backtrace of the 2nd threadp  precodethread 2 tid  0x2103, 0x925d180e libsystemkernel.dylibsemaphorewaittrap  10 frame 0 0x925d180e libsystemkernel.dylibsemaphorewaittrap  10 frame 1 0x0258cf08 libdispatch.dylibdispatchthreadsemaphorewait  16 frame 2 0x0258ab3a libdispatch.dylibdispatchbarriersyncfslow  149 frame 3 0x0258aa5c libdispatch.dylibdispatchbarriersyncf  37 frame 4 0x00b64c8b CoreDataperform  187 frame 5 0x00b67659 CoreData[NSManagedObjectContextNestedContextSupport managedObjectContextDidUnregisterObjectsWithIDs]  73 frame 6 0x00bdf2db CoreData97[NSManagedObjectContextNestedContextSupport managedObjectContextDidUnregisterObjectsWithIDs]blockinvoke0  75 frame 7 0x00b64cc1 CoreDatainternalBlockToNSManagedObjectContextPerform  17 frame 8 0x0259b014 libdispatch.dylibdispatchclientcallout  14 frame 9 0x0258ad5f libdispatch.dylibdispatchbarriersyncfinvoke  58 frame 10 0x0258aaa3 libdispatch.dylibdispatchbarriersyncf  108 frame 11 0x00b64c8b CoreDataperform  187 frame 12 0x00b67659 CoreData[NSManagedObjectContextNestedContextSupport managedObjectContextDidUnregisterObjectsWithIDs]  73 frame 13 0x00b71c8c CoreData[NSManagedObjectContextNSInternalAdditions disposeObjectscountnotifyParent]  444 frame 14 0x00b71305 CoreData[NSManagedObjectContextNSInternalAdditions dispose]  597 frame 15 0x00b70e15 CoreData[NSManagedObjectContext dealloc]  325 frame 16 0x00bd872f CoreDatainternalBlockToDeallocNSManagedObjectContext  79 frame 17 0x0259b014 libdispatch.dylibdispatchclientcallout  14 frame 18 0x0258b418 libdispatch.dylibdispatchqueuedrain  239 frame 19 0x0258b2a6 libdispatch.dylibdispatchqueueinvoke  59 frame 20 0x0258c280 libdispatch.dylibdispatchrootqueuedrain  231 frame 21 0x0258c450 libdispatch.dylibdispatchworkerthread2  39 frame 22 0x971cde12 libsystemc.dylibpthreadwqthread  441 codepre

Negative 314 pI have a header file which begins with p  precodeif definedGLOBALH define  GLOBALH codepre  pthen some code followed byp  precodeendif codepre  pThe code contains only function declarations, some include of other header files and the a few template functions. However, the problem occurs when I add one single line of code. I get linker error that the function I added has already been defined in an object file. Im using Visual Studio 2012 Premium as compiler. I have tried to remove any existing function from the header file, and that also goes through the compiler. On the other hand, if I add any new line that may be new to the compiler, it refuses to compile saying it has already been defined. Does anyone have any clue what might be wrong or can I have stumbled upon an error inside the compiler itself which I highly doubt Edit The solution was to declare the function the the header file, but to define it in the CPP file. But the real issue was that when I include a header file for returning an object of the type declared in the header file, it does not compile. It many of the errors Missing  in front of  which was types declared in other header files.p

Negative 314 pIm attempting to make a translusent popup that covers the entire screen using WPF. The idea is to effectively create the light box style effect that we all see regularly when using assorted webpages.  The application runs full screen no option to close, minimise, etc and replaces the windows shell.  Because of this the window needs to stretch to cover the entire of the screen.  The desired effect is to have a new window pop up covering the full screen.  This window will have a translucent background with some central content that will be completely opaque. Interaction with the central content will be the only way for the user to interact with the application.p  pThe problem that I am facing is the when AllowsTransparency is set to False the Window is not transparent, as you would expect. But when I set AllowsTransparencyTrue then the window and all its contents including the central content is completely transparent. The new window, while invisible is there and is stopping any interaction with they system.p  pHas any one else encountered this problem, of windows not being visible at all when AllowsTransparencetrue is set, or even better found a solution or work around for it p  pThe xaml for the window isp  precodeltWindow xClassViews.BorderedPopupView                  xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation                  xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml                  xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006                   xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008                   mcIgnorabled BackgroundDynamicResource WindowBackground AllowsTransparencyTruegt         ltWindow.Resourcesgt             ltSolidColorBrush xKeyTranslusentBrush Opacity0.1gt             ltSolidColorBrush xKeyWindowBackground ColorTransparentgt         ltWindow.Resourcesgt         ltViewbox StretchDirectionBoth StretchFill Margin5,0,13,8 gt             ltGrid Height768 Width1024 BackgroundStaticResource TranslusentBrushgt             ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                 ltColumnDefinition Width2gtltColumnDefinitiongt                 ltColumnDefinition Width6gtltColumnDefinitiongt                 ltColumnDefinition Width2gtltColumnDefinitiongt             ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt             ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                 ltRowDefinition Height2gtltRowDefinitiongt                 ltRowDefinition Height6gtltRowDefinitiongt                 ltRowDefinition Height2gtltRowDefinitiongt             ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                 ltGrid Opacity1 Grid.Row1 Grid.Column1gt                     ltContentControl xNamePopup Grid.Row1 Grid.Column1gt                 ltGridgt              ltGridgt             ltViewboxgt     ltWindowgt codepre

Negative 314 pI have taken over maintaining an Android app that has been built to use both HttpURLConnection and HttpClient from threads. A new instance is used each time, rather than reusing a shared instance I know that this is not good practice, at least for HttpClient, and I intend to change it. Most of the connections are made to the same server I find that when some connections are busy, other threads are blocked. I understand from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4654480androidhttpclientperfomanceAndroid HttpClient perfomancea that  HttpClient per default allows only two concurrent connections to the same target host. I also see from the answer in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9551058urlconnectionorhttpclientwhichoffersbetterfunctionalityandmoreefficieURLConnection or HTTPClient  Which offers better functionality and more efficiencya that with HttpUrlConnection concurrent connections to the same host get serialized. p  pHow do I change the concurrent connections limit for HttpClient and HttpUrlConnection Can HttpURLConnection and HttpClient coexist in the same app without problems, or would it be better to use just one of them Thanks.p

Negative 314 pThis might be a basic problem Im facing during integration of application over sailfin with a PSTN gateway. The initial INVITE is received from the gateway and processed internally then the 100 trying and 200 OK response is sent back to the gateway. But the gateway never responds back with ACK. p  pInitial investigation shows that the INVITE has been received from remote port xxxxx any random UDP port while inside INVITE Header, the  via header contains port as 5060 and the contact header also contains 5060. As the via header has port information 5060, Sailfin always sends responses back to the port 5060 instead of port xxxxx on which the request has been received. p  pIs there any way in Sailfin to ignore the via header information and send back the response to the port on which it has received the request Or do I need to manipulate the via headerp
Negative 314 pI have currently coded a registration page with facebook on one of my netsuite sites. The thing that I am having an issue with is, I do not know how to take the data from the registration page and have it be read onto another script and then sent over to the netsuite registration page.p  pNetsuite has not integrated facebook with their site yet, and were limited to what we can do on there, which makes this problem a little scarce. p  pThis is the third step to my problem and I should be solved. The issue is I need to know how I am to take the data from the JSON and have it sent to the netsuite registration script properly. p  pNetsuite is limited to JavaScriptASP code I believe, so something done around JavaScript would be the most logical workaround.p  pThanksp

Negative 314 pI am trying to write a Java program that when you click on a certain element in the JFrame, the background of a JLabel is changed. The function that the event handling method calls to change the background does not work when called from the event, however it does work whenever you call the method somewhere independent of any event. Does anyone know how you would go about changing the background on MouseRelease event, since using an event handling method like so doesnt workp  precodeprivate void MouseReleaseEventjava.awt.event.MouseEvent evt                                                    Do some random stuff, like a println.      This println works as a normal println statement should.     System.out.printlnHello World      Now lets try the method that changes the background.      This method will not work within this event handler, but trying it outside      of it does work.     changeBackground     codepre  ul liNote The above code is solely for showing my problem. It is not actually part of my code. I am not releasing the code because I am working on the program with a friend, and he does not want to release the code, even if it is just a small part of it with which nothing valuable can be done.li ul  pstrongEditstrong As per the request of all of those trying to help me, I have uploaded the NetBeans project workspace to FileDropper in a zip file, which you can download a hrefhttpwww.filedropper.commousereleaseeventstackoverflowdemo relnofollowherea. You will notice that when I call the method from the main class, it does flash another image and return to the current one as I want, but when you release the mouse from clicking on Play, it does not call it, even though it should. Feel free to experiment with the code as you wish.p  pstrongEdit 2strong Since it has also been requested that I post the code for those that do not want to download the workspace, here it isp  pSimon.javap  precodepackage simon  public class Simon      public static void mainString[] args           Load all of the other class files into this main class.

Negative 314 pI really try not to ask questions on here, but Ive been googling for a bit now and cant find the answer or another method to try. I have a CentOS box at my house hooked to a router.

In iptables Ive run it just how it is and Ive run it through tcp dport 8000 and sport 8000 with the same results. Just cant quite seem to crack the code. Ive also setup port forwarding on my router so port 8000 is directed at 140.

Negative 314 pIm trying to find the way to debug a PHP web site, htmlcssjavscript client side code.p  pIm familiarized with VS2008 and VS2010, creating ASP .Net applications. This type of sites are very easy to debug with VS2010, only adding breakpoints.p  pi.e. I add a breakpoint on onclick event of a button, and the code stops this point when click the button.p  pBut... I cant find any approoach like this with PHP. All the examples Ive seen talks about a simple php file, debugged with ElcipsePDT or similar rapidphp, aptana, and no event listening appears on these tutorials.p  pOther problem with ASP .NET projects, you can set the default aspx file. Later, you click debug button, and all thing goes on, thats simple. But I cant find how can I do that with PHP with EclipsePDT or Aptana.p  pCan somebody help mep
Negative 314 pI wrote a simple JSF 2.0 Webapp that collects data, stores it in an ArrayList, then generates a JSON file.  This process executes every n seconds.  My webapp has a button to start and stop this process.  To do this I created a daemon thread.  The problem is I assume at first launch that the daemon is not started.  What I would like to do is every time the webapp has been launched check to see if my daemon thread is running or not.  This way if I navigate away from my webapp and come back it will correctly give me a start or stop option.  Ive googled around a bit and havent been able to find a solution for this.p  pIs there a way to check if a specific thread is currently running in the JVMp

Now comes the discount part. See the points belowp  pConditionsp  ol lipIf No discount has been given, than 1 of BSP will be allocated to Incentive to the Sales Person.pli lipIf Discount given to booking is between .1 to 1, than .75 of BSP will be allocated to Incentive to the Sales Person.pli lipIf Discount given to booking is between 1 .1 to 2, than .50 of BSP will be allocated to Incentive to the Sales Person.pli lipIf Discount given to booking is between 2 and above, than .25 of BSP will be allocated to Incentive to the Sales Person.pli ol  pIn the above tables it us clear that 578 has booked 4 units, two with discounts an two without discounts.p  pSo his incentive will be calculated as p  precode  var incentive  totalnoofunitsbookedwithagent  2500   since there might be a possibility that more than one units can be  booked by a sales person.No we have to find if there is any discount   applied there, if its there, then extract the incentive for each unit  and total it using the above condition.

Negative 314 pIve got an application with 3 distributed dataSources com.atomikos.jdbc.AtomikosDataSourceBean. Im using Atomikos transaction manager as JTA implementation.  Every dataSource works with PostgreSQL database. Now, Im invoking my queries consequentially to each dataSource, and everything is working ok. p  pIm wondering, if it is possible, using  JTA, to invoke my queries in parallel multithreading, concurrentlyp  pIve tried simply to invoke query in newly created thread, using jdbcTemplate Spring. Firstly, Ive faced a spring issue. Spring stores the transactional context in ThreadLocal field, so it wasnt resolved properly in my new thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16835974springtransactionmanagerandmultithreadingSpring transaction manager and multithreadinga. Ive solved this issue, by setting same transactional context into newly created threads ThreadLocal. But the same issue Im facing in the Atomikos code. They also store the CompositeTransactionImp in the thread scoped map BaseTrancationManagergetCurrentTx. But in Atomikos case it isnt possible to set there values for new thread. So I cant perform my queries concurrently because it seems that Atomikos doesnt support such approach.  But Ive also looked through JTA specification and found their the following Multiple threads may concurrently be associated with the same global transaction. 3.2 TransactionManager Interface, a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comotndocsjcpjta1.1specothJSpecsubmitDownloadhttpdownload.oracle.comotndocsjcpjta1.1specothJSpecsubmitDownloadap  pstrongQUESTIONstrong How can I invoke two or more queries to different dataSources concurrently, using JTA 2 phase commit, in scope of one global transactionp  pstrongDataSources config in tomcat contextstrongp  precodeltResource namejdbcdb1 authContainer typecom.atomikos.jdbc.AtomikosDataSourceBean           factorycom.company.package.AtomikosDataSourceBeanFactory           xaDataSourceClassNameorg.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource           xaProperties.serverNamelocalhost           xaProperties.portNumber5451           xaProperties.databaseNamedb1           uniqueResourceNamejdbcdb1           xaProperties.usersecretpassword           xaProperties.passwordsecretpassword           minPoolSize5           maxPoolSize10           testQuerySELECT 1  gt  ltResource namejdbcdb2 authContainer typecom.atomikos.jdbc.AtomikosDataSourceBean           factorycom.company.package.AtomikosDataSourceBeanFactory           xaDataSourceClassNameorg.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource           xaProperties.serverNamelocalhost           xaProperties.portNumber5451           xaProperties.databaseNamedb2           uniqueResourceNamejdbcdb2           xaProperties.usersecretpassword           xaProperties.passwordsecretpassword           minPoolSize5           maxPoolSize10           testQuerySELECT 1  gt  ltResource namejdbcdb3 authContainer typecom.atomikos.jdbc.AtomikosDataSourceBean           factorycom.company.package.AtomikosDataSourceBeanFactory           xaDataSourceClassNameorg.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource           xaProperties.serverNamelocalhost           xaProperties.portNumber5451           xaProperties.databaseNamedb3           uniqueResourceNamejdbcdb3           xaProperties.usersecretpassword           xaProperties.passwordsecretpassword           minPoolSize5           maxPoolSize10           testQuerySELECT 1  gt codepre  pstrongTransaction manager config in spring contextstrongp  precode ltbean idtransactionManager classcom.atomikos.icatch.jta.UserTransactionManager   initmethodinit destroymethodclose lazyinittruegt   ltproperty nameforceShutdown valuefalse gt  ltbeangt codepre  pstrongCodestrongp  precode    final SqlParameterSource parameters  getSqlParameterSourceCreator.convertentity       Solving Springs ThreadLocal issue saving thread local params     final MapltObject, Objectgt resourceMap  TransactionSynchronizationManager.getResourceMap     final ListltTransactionSynchronizationgt synchronizations  TransactionSynchronizationManager.getSynchronizations     final boolean actualTransactionActive  TransactionSynchronizationManager.isActualTransactionActive     final String currentTransactionName  TransactionSynchronizationManager.getCurrentTransactionName     final AtomicReferenceltThrowablegt exceptionHolder  new AtomicReferenceltThrowablegt       Running query in a separate thread.     final Thread thread  new Threadnew Runnable          Override         public void run              try                   Solving Springs ThreadLocal issue setting thread local values to newly created thread.                 for Map.EntryltObject, Objectgt entry  resourceMap.entrySet                      TransactionSynchronizationManager.bindResourceentry.getKey, entry.getValue                                  if synchronizations  null ampamp synchronizations.isEmpty                      TransactionSynchronizationManager.initSynchronization                     for TransactionSynchronization synchronization  synchronizations                          TransactionSynchronizationManager.registerSynchronizationsynchronization                                                       TransactionSynchronizationManager.setActualTransactionActiveactualTransactionActive                 TransactionSynchronizationManager.setCurrentTransactionNamecurrentTransactionName                   Executing query.                 final String query  insert into ...

Negative 314 pSO I want to monitor multiple system calls mkdir, fork, write, open, pipe, read, rmdir, etc. I have gotten a kprobe solution to work where I can monitor a single system call. my First attempt at doing this was to create multiple system calls like sop  precodeprobe[0].symbolname  sysmkdir probe[1].symbolname  syswrite int i fori  0 i lt 2 i      probe[i].prehandler    sysmoninterceptbefore  called prior to function      probe[i].posthandler   sysmoninterceptafter  called on function return      probe[i].faulthandler  sysmoninterceptfault     if registerkprobeampprobe[i]              printkKERNERR MODULENAME registerkprobe failedn         return EFAULT          printkKERNINFO MODULENAME loaded probe dn,i  codepre  pthis crashes the VM So now I am looking for another way to monitor multiple system calls. My only idea so far is to fork the process. I know kprobe works on setting a register and then checking that register So I assume the reason it crashed earlier was because multiple kprobe instances tried to write to a single register. So Forking it seems like it might work because every system call monitor will have its own memory space registers, heap, stack, etc. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 314 pI have created a board game in Java that is not different in principle from checkers. It works fine in the console but now Im trying to create graphics. I have a Piece class, a Tile class that checks if it is empty or occupied by a white or a black checkers piece, a Grid class that keeps track of the tiles in a matrix, and a Game class. p  pCurrently, the game can be played in the Grid class when we run the Grid class, the user specifies the size of the board in the console and then plays the game by giving the x and y coordinates of the tile that the user wishes to select. What I would like to change is to run the game in the Game class, which is an extension of JPanel and implements MouseListener code given below. The game board will be a fixed size Ill begin with 5x5 and I have drawn a picture of a grid which should be in the background of the game. There will be an instance variable Grid g  new Grid5,5. I have also drawn pictures of the different checkers pieces which will be used, they should be distributed in the foreground on specific tiles. What I want to happen is that when the user clicks a tile, the checkers pieces move. Ideally, I would do this so that the program sees the coordinates of the place that the mouse clicks say that the JPanel is 500x500 pixels and the user clicks the pixel with the coordinate 0,500, then we check if 0,500 belongs to some tile, if it doesnt then nothing happens, if it does belong to a tile on the Grid g then g.playsomething,something.p  precode            import java.awt.Color             import java.awt.FlowLayout             import java.awt.Graphics             import java.awt.event.MouseEvent             import java.awt.event.MouseListener             import javax.swing.JFrame             import javax.swing.JLabel             import java.util.             import java.awt.             import java.awt.event.             import java.awt.FlowLayout             import java.awt.event.MouseEvent             import java.awt.event.MouseListener             import javax.swing.              public class Game extends JPanel implements MouseListener                   private Grid g  new Grid5,5                  public Game                      JFrame frame  new JFrameBoardgame                     frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE                     frame.setLayoutnew FlowLayout                      frame.setLayoutnew FlowLayout                     frame.setPreferredSizenew Dimension500,500                     frame.pack                     frame.setVisibletrue                     frame.addMouseListenerthis                                   public void mouseClickedMouseEvent e                          here we check if the user clicked on a tile,      if that happens then we get the x and ycoordinates of the tile and then g.playx,y                                   public void mouseEnteredMouseEvent e   we are not really interested in this method or the following  mouse methods but they are necessary for the mouselistener                                    public void mouseExitedMouseEvent e                             public void mousePressedMouseEvent e                             public void mouseReleasedMouseEvent e                             public static void mainString args[]                  new Game                       codepre  pSo in essence, what I would like to do isp  pi Have a background picture this is easy right [update I have done this by means of using a JLabel, if there is any better way to do it please tell me].p  pii Fix the MouseListener so that the pieces move when a tile is clicked.

Negative 314 pI would like to write a method that will print the entire scene graph including the names of the nodes and the css properties associated with the nodes to the console.

Negative 314 pI am writing a Java batch which is listening messages from a queue Oracle AQ and sending them to another queue Tibco EMS, where they are processed by a Tibco process BW.p  pThe problem is that the Oracle AQ driver automatically add some properties to messages JMSXGroupID, JMSXGroupSeq which cause errors when they are processed by Tibco process because they have bad values  JMSXGroupSeq should be an int but is set to null. Tibco falls into error when trying to parse message properties...p  pSo I would like to remove only these 2 properties from all messages but it seems that the jms api only offers a clearProperties method but no single property remove method Im using ths javax.jms.Message interface.p  pFor now, I can see two solutions p  ol lipset a correct value to these 2 properties, as Im assuming they will not be used further by Tibcopli lipread all properties and reconstruct the messages without the 2 which cause problem.

Negative 314 psome time ago I decided to learn how to write drivers.

Actually trying to stop the driver service changes its status to NOTSTOPPABLE. Then I have to restart if I want another try. I work with Windows 7 and with same outcomes I have tried to do it booting up with TESTSIGNING ON and with no signiture required too. A little bit odd thing is the load doesnt work either unless I create device in the entry function. Only then I can find my driver with winobj in the Driver directory. I have also tried it out on another machine with Win7 installation but it turned out local settings are not the issue. If you recognize this kind of kernel behaviour I would really like to hear it, thanks.p  pActually if know about some programm that can load .sys and then is able to unload it, drop a link or name.

However, I have found nothing. I have also researched similar problems on this forum as well as other forums, but the solutions use methods that I have not yet learned about and thus, my teacher would not allow them in my project code. Some of the methods I saw were arrays and the getline function. We have not yet learned about either.p  pNote My teacher does not want us to store every integer from the input file. He wants us to open the file a single time and store the number of games, and then use loops and if statements for determining the high, average, and low numbers from each line.p  pIf anyone could help me out, I would GREATLY appreciate it Thanksp

Negative 314 pI have a page on my site which will show all parks within a region by default. I would then like it to only show specific items based on a clicked region and hide all the other parks.p  pSo far I have 3 regions with and id e.g. region1, region2 and region3 I would then like it to show only parks within those regions so if I clicked on the id of region1 it would only show the parks with the class of region1 and hide all the others, this is the same for the other regions.p  pMy biggest problem with getting this to work is that the client will be able to add more regions in the future and more parks to those new regions.p  pSo what I need is JQuery to pick up every region id which will be added in the future and pair them with the relevant parks.p  precodeltdiv idsidebar classpullleftgt     lth2gtParks By Regionlth2gt     ltul classnav navpills navstackedgt         ltligt             lta hrefregion1gtSouth East Englandltagt         ltligt         ltligt             lta hrefregion2gtSouth West Englandltagt         ltligt         ltligt             lta hrefregion3gtNorth Walesltagt         ltligt     ltulgt ltdivgt ltdiv idcontentgt     ltdiv idcontentWrappergt               lth1gtREGION TEXTlth1gt         ltdiv classregion1 pullleftgtPark 1ltdivgt         ltdiv classregion2 pullleftgtPark 2ltdivgt         ltdiv classregion3 pullleftgtPark 3ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pHere is my JSFiddle to help give you an idea of what Im talking about... a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nety9CV9 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nety9CV9ap

Negative 314 pI was wondering whether it is a good idea to create a system wide rendering server that is responsible for the rendering of all application elements. Currently, applications usually have their own context, meaning whatever data might be identical across different applications, it will be duplicated in GPU memory and the more frequent resource management calls only decrease the count of usable render calls. From what I understand, the OpenGL execution engineserver itself is sequentialsingle threaded in design. So technically, everything that might be reused across applications, and especially heavy stuff like bitmap or geometry caches for text and UI, is just clogging the server with unnecessary transfers and memory usage.p  pAre there any downsides to having a scenegraph shared across multiple applications Naturally, assuming the correct handling of clients which accidentally freeze.p

Negative 314 pI am using a jQuery UI dialog and a hrefhttpapi.jqueryui.comdialogoptionbuttons relnofollowI am adding buttons to the dialog in JavaScripta based on some entitlements logic. I pass in a boolean from my serverside AJAX call if I am entitled and then I show different buttons based on that flag.p  pWhat concerned me is what is preventing someone from using developer tools like Firebug and putting a breakpoint on that line that does the check and either altering the flag or dragging to skip over that entitlements check.p  pSo my question is specific to adding buttons onto a jQuery UI dialog because its not like you can add the buttons from the server side since its a jQuery plugin, but I guess it highlights a more general point around any entitlements logic on the client side being vulnerable. So if there are any general best practices around this point I would be interested but still looking for an answer to my specific example.p  pstrongNOTEstrong I am also doing a serverside entitlement check on POST as a backup, so I am still protected but I am still concerned about the point above.p

Negative 314 pI am working on an MVC EF site that has a SQL DB with two tables Entries, Members.p  pModerators of the site can assign tasks to Members which will be logged in Entries.p  pIm trying to determine a way to prioritize the Members list so that the Member with the least amount of tasks as an alwaysincrementing number will always OrderBy from the top so that the Moderators can assign based on who has taken the least amount of tasks.p  pI explored doing this in the DB itself I can create a View that will check the Entries against the names on Members and provide a total of how many tasks they have been assigned. However EFdbContext doesnt work with SQL Views apparently. p  pI have an EntryController which feeds the Entries Table into the View and a MemberController which simply lists the members. My next thought is to simply call an action in the MemberController that increments a specific Members count number when called. Im not sure if this is the best way to do this or how I can even call both the InputSubmit POST from the Html.BeginForm and the Increment function at the same time.p  pThe BeginForm is on a stronglytyped view of the EntryController so Im also not sure how I could pass a Member back to the member controller so instead I made the function to identify the member based on a string grab .first and incrementp  precode    public void incrementCountstring member              Member[] members  null         members[0]  repository.Members.Wherep gt p.Name  member.First         members[0].Count  members[0].Count  1      codepre  pI am completely lost at this point so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 314 pQuestions I am pulling my hair out over.p  ol liHow do I get the array to add data to current index, then increment to the next index to add changed JTextField data for the next button press. currently Im overwriting the same index. li ol  pI have tried to figure out actionlisteners for the button Submit that uses a counter with nesting of the loop. played with ideas from question 23331198 and 3010840 and 17829577 many others as a reference but didnt really get it to far. Most searches pull up info on managing buttons with arrays and creating button arrays so I assume Im not using the correct wording to search with.

A strongviewstrong should use that data to decide how and what to show on the view...  further more to this, if you are worried that an admin button is shown accidently, if they click on that button provided by the view engineer, it doesnt matter.. the user gets taken to another page which loads a controller which insists that actually, this user does not have access to this page...  li liThe view guy should be asking questions like, can this user edit projects... rather than have I been given a button that I can display to the viewli ul  pWhat if the view guy decided actually, for design purposes, I want to show buttons that the user cant use... and provide a message stating why he cant use it... The controller in my colleagues example has provided a list of buttons that will now have to be ignored considering the view engineer artistdesigner is decided actually, screw your controller...

However, it feels like that this approach to TDD in Servlets is devious and more timeconsuming than TDD ordinary Java classes as HTML created in the ServletTest is copied to the Servlet for the most part and subsequently changed regarding the format e.g. removing backslashes instead of testing the output in a Test for ordinary Java Classes and writing most of the code in the main.p  pemServletTestemp  precodeHttpServletRequest mockedHttpServletRequest  mockHttpServletRequest.class HttpServletResponse mockedHttpServletResponse  mockHttpServletResponse.class HttpSession mockedHttpSession  mockHttpSession.class  StringWriter stringWriter  new StringWriter PrintWriter printWriter  new PrintWriterstringWriter  private final String doGetHtmlStringPartOne  lthtmlgtltbodygtlttablegt          lttrgtlttdgtlth1gt private final String doGetHtmlStringPartTwo  lth1gtlttdgt          ltform methodpostgt          ltinput typehidden namerandomDigitRange value1 gt          ltinput typehidden namerandomMathematicalOperator           value1 gtltinput typehidden namefractionBoolean           value  private final String doGetHtmlStringPartThree  lttdgtltinput typeradio nameuserInput valued.dgtdssdlttdgt  private final String doGetHtmlStringPartFour  lttrgtlttrgtlttdgt          ltinput typesubmit valueSubmit           onclickthis.form.actionToBeDefinedServlet gt          lttdgtlttrgtlttablegtltformgtltbodygtlthtmlgt          ltform actiontobedefinedservletgt          ltinput typesubmit valueHomegtltformgt  Test public void testBooleanFractionTrue throws IOException, ServletException      mockDoGet     assertTruestringWriter.getBuffer.toString.trim.matchesexpectedDoGetHtmlString1  1  1  1, true   public String expectedDoGetHtmlStringString assignment,         Boolean fractionBoolean      return doGetHtmlStringPartOne  assignment  doGetHtmlStringPartTwo                fractionBoolean     gt  n              doGetHtmlStringPartThree  n  doGetHtmlStringPartFour   public void mockDoGet throws IOException, ServletException      whenmockedHttpServletRequest.getSession.thenReturn             mockedHttpSession     whenmockedHttpServletResponse.getWriter.thenReturnprintWriter     whenmockedHttpServletRequest.getParameterfractionBoolean             .thenReturntrue     whenmockedHttpServletRequest.getParameterrandomDigitRange             .thenReturn1     when             mockedHttpServletRequest                     .getParameterrandomMathematicalOperator             .thenReturn1     whenmockedHttpServletRequest.getSession.thenReturn             mockedHttpSession     new ToBeDefinedServlet.doGetmockedHttpServletRequest,             mockedHttpServletResponse  codepre  pemServletemp  precodeprotected void doGetHttpServletRequest request,         HttpServletResponse response throws ServletException, IOException      calculation.setFractionBooleanBoolean.parseBooleanrequest             .getParameterfractionBoolean     calculation.setAssignmentDouble.parseDoublerequest             .getParameterrandomDigitRange, Double.parseDoublerequest             .getParameterrandomMathematicalOperator     PrintWriter out  response.getWriter      out.printlnlthtmlgtltbodygtlttablegt              lttrgtlttdgtlth1gt              calculation.getAssignment              lth1gtlttdgt              ltform methodpostgt              ltinput typehidden namerandomDigitRange value              request.getParameterrandomDigitRange               gt              ltinput typehidden namerandomMathematicalOperator value              request.getParameterrandomMathematicalOperator   gt              ltinput typehidden namefractionBoolean value              request.getParameterfractionBoolean   gt      for double possibleAnswer  calculation.getPossibleAnswersArray          String possibleAnswerFormat  Boolean.parseBooleanrequest                 .getParameterfractionBoolean  true                    new FractionpossibleAnswer      possibleAnswer                            out.printlnlttdgtltinput typeradio nameuserInput value                  possibleAnswer  gt  possibleAnswerFormat  lttdgt           out.printlnlttrgt              lttrgtlttdgtltinput typesubmit valueSubmit               onclickthis.form.actionToBeDefinedServlet gtlttdgt              lttrgtlttablegtltformgtltbodygtlthtmlgt              ltform actiontobedefinedservletgtltinput typesubmit valueHomegtltformgt  codepre

Negative 314 pCurious as to the reason the constructor string const char s, sometimes alters the characters in const char . I have a simple method that checks if a flag is set alters the string in some way searches a tree and return a value. It seems to work fine if I only use strings however for some odd reason when I use const char  received from another function as a parameter into the function the const char  I recieve back is sometimes returned incomplete. Which is the cause for subtle errors I was unable to locate until recently. It seems to work if inside the method I create another string and append the string parameter to the new string but this seems like the wrong way to resolve this issue. I believe it could be a misunderstanding of the proper use of the constructor, Does anyone have any insight into this subtle issuep  pAs a simple example the terminal returns the below result, Note the symbol for an incomplete character did not copy correctly and instead is blank.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHC7AZ.png altenter image description herep  pstrongEDITstrongbr T.C.br I in no way blame the string class T.C., Im well aware that it is my error and I am attempting to understand the issue. It is most probably a misinterpretation on the use of the constructors in the stdstring class. A bit of back story I am using CC and java together for practice. I created a class that seemed to pass minimal testing in C and created a wrapper so that I can use it in C. When I pass a string as a parameter instead of const char  it works without a problem however to the best of my understanding stdstring should copy the characters though this I am not sure. Im aware that a people will tell me to only use C and not to mix the two like in the answers to other questions when individuals mix the two but any direction would be appreciated. p  pI wanted to make the question short originally but posted before adding the code. Attached is a snippet of its use and a proper picture of the missing character symbol I could not find earlier.p  pLZW.c C Classp  precode... const char  tex  TrieIntlongestPrefixtrie,input Find max prefix match tex printf25st,tex FOR SOME REASON TEX CHANGES AFTER THIS CALL arr[size]  TrieIntgettrie,tex   Add encoding  printf25sn,tex int t  strlentex ... codepre  pctrie.cpp CWrapper Classp  precode...

Negative 314 pSo, im writing a very very basic text editor that is going to allow a user to do certain things such as change the colour of the text, make it bold or apply a header styling.p  pThe first problem I have ran into is that selecting a word in text and applying bold to it will make it apply to the first instance of that word in the string when i do a replace,  i need to be able to replace the actual item selected, by index, rather than a straight word replace.p  pSecondly is it possible for me to set tags within the div for the user to type within click BOLD button and the user will type in and its set too bold etc, standard wysiwyg behaviour  p  pMy fiddle is here  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netd7uvvywu12 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netd7uvvywu12ap  pI apologise, I am a beginner with jQuery.p  pMy replace method for the text.p  precodevar span  lthtmlCongt  highlight  lthtmlCongt var text  textRegions1Text1.html textRegions1Text1.htmltext.replacehighlight, span codepre

Negative 314 pHi, I have a problem, that I have a C project that uses select C1114 features that for the MSVC compiler are at best only present in the CTPNov2013 compiler toolset. I am aware that there is a very similar topic a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24530666howtosetcorrectlyfromcmakelistthevisualstudioplatformtoolsettov100herea, and that the most relevant answer was that the toolset must not be tinkered with from the script, as the enduser will want to tinker with it.p  ol liFirst of all, I do not agree that the selection of the toolset is the privilage of the enduser whomever that might refer to in case a library under development.li liSecondly, the only thing Id like to accomplish is that CMake detects if various compiler capabilities are present, and if they are missing, AND the platform is MSVC, then depending on the version of MSVC CMake attempts to change the platform toolset to the CTP version. I know for a fact, that VS 12 will not recieve any more compiler updates at least not in CTPs, as this is a privilage of the VS 13 Beta from here on, so it is safe to assume that MSVCVER 1700 if that is the version corresponding to VS 12 toolsets can be selected using the script.li liThirdly, manually updating the generated Visual Studio project files often result in defunct project files. Not considering that it is tedious to change the toolset of roughly a dozen targets one by one, if the source path contains unicode characters which they do in my case, then cl.exe will fail to find them. This is an issue of CMake, and is related to character encoding of the project file and the way CMake writes paths. There is nothing I can do about this. The project files MUST be ready enough for me to only have to hit F7.li ol  pI have found a way to achieve what I wanted with the commandsp  precodesetCMAKEGENERATORTOOLSET CTPNov2013 CACHE STRING Platform Toolset FORCE  setCMAKEVSPLATFORMTOOLSET CTPNov2013 CACHE STRING Platform Toolset FORCE codepre  pHowever the problem with this is that the script needs to be run twice in order for this to take effect. Since the cmake commandline is invoked usingp  precodecmake GVisual Studio 12 2013 Win64 codepre  pThere is already a toolset selected, but I immediately wish to override the toolset incorporated into the x64 Configuration of the selected generator. Ultimately the user selects 3264bit builds from the command line as usual using the generator specification, but I wish to hide the incapabilities of the MSVC compiler from the enduser in case heshe has the CTP installed.p  pHow can I write the script and invoke it from the command line so it works for both the Visual Studio and NMake Makefiles generators and for the first invocation of CMakep

Negative 314 pThe effect Im trying to achieve is upon clicking a button a circle made up of 8 triangles spins around. When it stops the triangle at the top of the circle is selected. Then a fancybox overlay relative to the selected segment is opened this last part doesnt work yet. The order the segments are selected appears random to the user but it can be preset as Ive done in the CSS currently 3rd  6th  1st  8th  2nd  5th  7th  4th.p  pIve created a codepen to show my current progress on this which you can see by visiting the link below as its quite hard to explain.p  precodehttpcodepen.iomoypenDrbAL codepre  pOn clicking the Spin button the circle rotates 3 times 1080 degrees  an additional 270 degrees so the 3rd listitem is positioned at the top of the div  this works fine.p  pMy 1st question is On the 2nd click of the button, the circle needs to rotate 3 times again and then a bit more to position the next selected listitemsegment 6 at the top of the div and so on for each of the remaining items. Is there a way to do this without having to add 1080 to the amount the circle has already rotated So the value is always code1080degcode  the additional amount the circle needs to rotate to position the relevant segment at the top of the div. Otherwise the last items value is going to be something like 10000 degrees If this has to be done I guess Ill have to live with it and get my maths hat on.p  pThe 2nd question is Once the circle has finished rotating, how can I display the related fancybox overlay The IDs are currently the title of each overlay but could easily be overlay1, overlay2, etc to match the classes of spin1, spin2 set on the spinning wheel after each spin.p  pThanks, hope someone can helpp

Negative 314 pI am developing 2d platformer and Ive faced with a very strange triggers behaviour in Unity. I have made the enemy that can throw objects into main player. So I have made two empty GameObjects with Circle2D colliders on them and attached them into the enemy GameObject.

The first trigger ensures that when the enemys hand will pass through it, it will spawn an object that will be thrown in future, and the second trigger is responsible for throwing an object into main player. Every trigger has a Rigidbody2D component attached to it. The hands of the enemy have tags right hand and left hand and I am checking the in the OnTriggerEnter2D method. strongThis method is calling and I have log messages and this method is detecting that left or right hand are entering trigger.strong But the problem is in that this strongmethod is calling when the hand has already passed through trigger and get out of its bounds.strong Can anyone help me and explain why this is happening I have attached a picture where I draw a scheme and described my problem.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsCXhm.png altenter image description herep

Negative 314 pI have some system tests which do not need access to the tested code as they test already deployed applications. These tests and the source code of the tested applications lie in the same repository. The applications are deployed every here and there  fully independent of the tests. In JenkinsCI I run the tests periodically. When a Jenkins test job is executed the svn repo is updated, tests are compiled and run against some already running applications. If a test run fails I can see the latest changes from the repo in Jenkins Changes view, which often is an indicator of newly introduced bugs.p  pstrongNow to the problem.strong Id like to separate the tests from the application code repository.

Negative 314 pI recently asked a question regarding CTEs and using data with no true root records i.e Instead of the root record having a NULL parentId it is parented to itselfp  pThe question link is here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26545611creatingarecursivectewithnorootrecordCreating a recursive CTE with no rootrecordap  pThe answer has been provided to that question and I now have the data I require however I am interested in the difference between the two approaches that I THINK are available to me.p  pThe approach that yielded the data I required was to create a temp table with cleaned up parenting data and then run a recursive CTE against. This looked like belowp  precodeSelect CASE     WHEN ParentId  PartyId THEN NULL     ELSE ParentId END AS ActParentId , PartyId , PARTYCODE , PARTYNAME INTO Parties FROM DIMENSIONPARTIES WHERE CURRENTRECORD  1,  WITH linkedParties AS  Select ActParentId, PartyId, PARTYCODE, PARTYNAME, 0 AS LEVEL FROM Parties WHERE ActParentId IS NULL  UNION ALL  Select p.ActParentId, p.PartyId, p.PARTYCODE, p.PARTYNAME, Level  1 FROM Parties p inner join linkedParties t on p.ActParentId  t.PartyId   Select  FROM linkedParties Order By Level codepre  pI also attempted to retrieve the same data by defining two CTEs. One to emulate the creation of the temp table above and the other to do the same recursive work but referencing the initial CTE rather than a temp tablep  precodeWITH Parties AS Select CASE     WHEN ParentId  PartyId THEN NULL     ELSE ParentId END AS ActParentId , PartyId , PARTYCODE , PARTYNAME FROM DIMENSIONPARTIES WHERE CURRENTRECORD  1,  linkedParties AS  Select ActParentId, PartyId, PARTYCODE, PARTYNAME, 0 AS LEVEL FROM Parties WHERE ActParentId IS NULL  UNION ALL  Select p.ActParentId, p.PartyId, p.PARTYCODE, p.PARTYNAME, Level  1 FROM Parties p inner join linkedParties t on p.ActParentId  t.PartyId   Select  FROM linkedParties Order By Level codepre  pNow these two scripts are run on the same server however the temp table approach yields the results in approximately 15 seconds.p  pThe multiple CTE approach takes upwards of 5 minutes so long in fact that I have never waited for the results to return.p  pIs there a reason why the temp table approach would be so much quickerp  pFor what it is worth I believe it is to do with the record counts. The base table has 200k records in it and from memory CTE performance is severely degraded when dealing with large data sets but I cannot seem to prove that so thought Id check with the experts.p  pMany Thanksp

So for example itll send me something likep  precodeCustomerOrder [deliveries, deliveries.orderlines, deliveries.orderlines.qtyordered...] codepre  p..means, if deliveries are addeddeleted from a customerorder or if lines are addeddeleted from a delivery attached to a customer order or if the qtyordered on an orderline on a delivery attached to a customer order, then what the API expects is for me to serialize CustomerOrder along with the entire chain of relationships and sent to an update service i.e. servercustomerorderupdates type thing that will run various routines and fillin pieces of data and send the entire chain of objects back. p  pFor illustration purposes Ive put a simple example on here of an ordertotal I realize this is easily calculated clientside but theres a bunch of other stuff that would be duplication of code from the server. So, if the qtyordered on an orderline changes, I need to send the customerorder instance to the server, where it will update my total field.p  pOne of the challenges is that I cant hard code that dependency list by setting up observer functions with .observes type stuff, it has to be done dynamically after that dependency data is loaded presumably using addObserver.

Negative 314 pI know there are huge hurdles to overcome if you want to do something like loading PRISM modules in separate app domains so they can be loaded and unloaded. Im trying to load everything in a new app domain. This includes the shell window that holds the view region, the bootstrapper, and the modules.p  pI built a sample solution that mimics the way I need to implement this per the current software we are trying to transition. For now, this includes the EXE that basically loads some settings, a Core class and Wrapper class which handle loading the app domain, loading the shell window and module discovery The Core creates the new app domain and loads an instance of the Wrapper into it while the Wrapper discovers the modules and instantiates the shell, and finally the shell itself which is responsible for showing the shell and loading modules on demand.p  pThe problem I have run into is, when the Wrapper class is loaded into a new App Domain, everything runs without an exception but the module is never displayed digging further shows that the view is never added to the viewregion, apparently because the viewregion is never added to the Regions in the RegionManager. Everything works just fine if I instantiate the Wrapper in the original App Domain.p  pI am trying to figure out why this is happening and if there is a workaround. I know the process seems complex but its the method we are shooting for, for various different reasons. Any help on why I am having problems with the ViewRegion and App Domain would be greatly appreciate.

Negative 314 pSo I am building an simple iOS app using Swift. I need to kill my codeNSTimercode after the app entering background, and create a new one after the app is active again. p  pInitially my solution is to create a timer of codeNSTimercode class in codeViewDidLoadcode in the main controller file. And this causes a bug in my app.p  pI guess I need to kill the timer by using codeapplicationDidEnterBackgroundcode in strongAppDelegate.swiftstrong. But I am not exactly sure about how to do it. Should I create the timer class in strongAppDelegate.swiftstrong or in the main controller I dont know how Swift files share classes.p  pI have searched online for solutions, but those posts are all too old, the solutions are written in ObjectiveC.p  pI am an absolutely beginner.

The problem is, none of string formats I used is valid. the code goes as followsp  precodelet formatter  NSDateFormatter formatter.dateFormat  yyyyMMdd hhmmss var output  formatter.dateFromString20000101T000000.000Z let timeString  formatter.stringFromDateoutput codepre  pas far as I know, if I want to retrieve hours from NSData, I have to call formatter once more p  precodeformatter.dateFormat  hh codepre  pand call it on NSDate obtained from string. Am I right My first question is how to make the determine proper date format so the output will not be evaluated to nil The second question is Do I get it right or there is a simpler method or generally way to retrieve the hours from the following string 20000101T000000.000Z  I know I can do it via dealing with mere string without involving dateFormatter and NSDate, but wont such solution be vulnerable Please advice me whats the simplestand robust way to deal with this.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 314 pIm a C developer using VS 2012 and VS 2010 for developing AAA titles. I have read about not using STL and other stuff provided in the standard headers that come with VS. I read most of the stuff on the websites based on game programming and some are really from the people well known in the industry. I have seen cases where they wont even use vector, list, map and others and not even use utility functions and algorithms. In such cases they write those containers and stuff themselves which has almost the same interface and so much of debug and implementation time spent on such huge code.p  pI have two questionsp  p1 Isnt the C implementation that comes with VS optimized for the platform for better performance Isnt it using some intrinsic functions that people on the client end doesnt know about and supplying their own implementation would indeed be more slower in basic container operations such as insert, remove, find, swap, copy Lets assume that we supply our own custom allocators for faster memory management to every container that we use. Also, they take care of fragmentation, alignment and stuff. Why develop custom containers with almost same interface, why not spend that time on writing allocators and other stuff that might actually helpp  p2 There are times when we include a lot, a lot, of unnecessary stuff through the standard headers in a huge code base. Unnecessary, because we only needed a thing or two from such huge headers including other huge headers and so on. Now, I know templates arent instantiated unless used, same goes for the members functions inside them and blah blah. Since, these are precompiled headers, it is safe to assume that there is no compile time hit for that unnecessary stuff. My question is, is there any hidden effect of such inclusions on code size executable that grows with the huge growth of the code base In my opinion there shouldnt be, but I wanna know Im not mistaken just in case. p  pThanksp

Negative 314 pWe are building a mobile hybrid web app which among others is going to have images. We want to reduce loading times by serving the user an image that is appropriate for hisher device. We know how to do it but we dont know what sizes do we need.br Now, understanding image properties is not that simple given all the categories like rendered pixels, physical pixels, resolutions, dpi etc.. That is why Im asking for help here. Ive managed to do some research but I would feel more confident if someone could take a look at it.  p  pIve taken 15 android devices and 6 iOS ones that gave me a total of 21 screen resolutions Ive taken retina displays into consideration. From those Ive selected 4 widthsheights to represent the images longest part widthheight. The reason Ive taken both widths and heights is due to portrait and landscape view of mobile devices. Ive also established that the images dpi is not that relevant and should, if possible, be 72dpi. Lastly I think that 4 image sizes should be enough. The script we are going to use will be able to detect retina display and simply serve a higher resolution image.br Therefore, the image properties I came up with are 480px, 960px, 1600px, 2560px of heightwidth value, depending on what is higher. Are those dimensions optimal Will we achieve fast load times, good mobile synch and image quality Can someone probably point me to a place where it is clearly stated what image sizes should we use   p  pTLDRbr Is using the following widths or heights for images 480px, 960px, 1600px, 2560px in a hybric mobile app a good optimization Will the images load fast and look sharp  p  pThanksp

Better means more efficient or clearer codewise.p  pTo read the data I do the following   p  ol limake codevar rawDatacode by converting the codeNSMutableDatacode to codeUnsafeMutablePoitnerltUInt8gtcodeli liCreate codevar ptr  UnsafeMutablePointerltUInt8gtcode from coderawData.mutableBytescodeli liCreate an array codebytescode of type codeUnsafeMutableBufferPointerltUInt8gtcode from a combo of the 1st two variablesli liCreate a new array consisting of just the bytes containing the string codebytes[19]code  codebytes[26]codeli liExtract this array into a string li ol  pThen to set the variable I have 3 methods but the one I think I would use is 1. Make a new string of 8 string 2. Create code[UInt8]code array of the characters of the string 3. Loop through each byte in the new array and set the value of the byte in the codebytescode array to the value in questionp  pIm assuming there is some way where I can be working directly with the parent byte array as opposed to making a subarray to work with.  Playground code is below.  Im looking for a cleaner way to do this and perhaps there is not one.p  pThanksp  h3Playground Codeh3  precodeimport Cocoa import AppKit    This is the raw data var testBytes  [UInt8]  [0x14, 0x00, 0xAB, 0x45, 0x49, 0x1F, 0xEF, 0x15, 0xA8, 0x89, 0x78, 0x0F, 0x09, 0xA9, 0x07, 0xB0, 0x01, 0x20, 0x01, 0x4E, 0x38, 0x32, 0x35, 0x56, 0x20, 0x20, 0x20, 0x00]  Convert into msgData var msgData  NSMutableDatabytes testBytes, length testBytes.count    Store raw data into a byte array for messing with var rawData NSMutableData  NSMutableDatadata msgData var ptr UnsafeMutablePointerltUInt8gt  UnsafeMutablePointerltUInt8gtrawData.mutableBytes var bytes  UnsafeMutableBufferPointerltUInt8gt  UnsafeMutableBufferPointerltUInt8gtstart ptr, count rawData.length    Extract Callsign from the data stream var callsignArray  [UInt8]  [bytes[19], bytes[20], bytes[21], bytes[22], bytes[23], bytes[24], bytes[25], bytes[26]] var callsignString  NSStringbytes callsignArray, length callsignArray.count, encoding NSUTF8StringEncoding let callsignString0  callsignString printlncallsignArray println1.

At the moment on the WebViews superview I have this tracking areap  precodeNSTrackingArea trackingArea  [[NSTrackingArea alloc] initWithRect[self visibleRect]                                                                 optionsNSTrackingMouseEnteredAndExited  NSTrackingMouseMoved  NSTrackingInVisibleRect  NSTrackingActiveAlways                                                                 ownerself                                                                 userInfonil] codepre  pThis works as I want it to, Im receiving the all the mouse events. However, the WebViews dont seem to be responding as intended. JavaScript mouse move events only fire when I hold and drag, not just hover and drag. p  pIve tried using hitTest to get the correct view, but nothing seems to work. Heres an example method, Im using the isHandlingMouse boolean because without it an infinite loop seemed to be created for some reasonp  precode NSView handleTrackedMouseEvent NSEvent theEvent     ifisHandlingMouse         return nil     isHandlingMouse  true     NSView hit  [self hitTest theEvent.locationInWindow]     if hit ampamp hit  self          return hit          return nil    voidmouseMovedNSEvent theEvent     NSView hit  [self handleTrackedMouseEvent theEvent]     if hit         [hit mouseMoved theEvent]          isHandlingMouse  false  codepre  pThe hit view, is a WebHTMLView, which appears to be a private class. Everything seems like it should be working,but perhaps theres something Im doing thats breaking it, or Im sending the event to the WebHTMLView incorrectly.p

Negative 314 pI have a button in a tableview cell that when clicked looks at the indexPath row of that cell and grabs the username text of that value passes it as the [follow] object value, sets the current user as the [follower] object value and then sets the [status] object to Pending.

The issue is that with my current setup if at least one of the conditions is true, then all of my button titles change automatically to Pending as opposed to only those cells where the button was clicked.

And explain how to use the setup.p  pSomething likep  precodeimport sys, myapp, IPython  explainusageofsession   You can use session.blah to frobnicate the foobaringo   session  myapp.MyComplicatedSessionFactoryincluding     configuration.paramsfromfile  sys.exit     IPython.startipythonusernsdictsessionsession,                           banner2explainusageofsession  codepre  h1Constraintsh1  pThe more specific usecase is that this script is being generated automatically by codebuildoutcodes codezc.recipe.eggcode, which locates codeIPython.startipythoncode using codeIPythoncode code[consolescripts]code entry point, so Im limited in the amount of customization I can actually pass into the script, and I cant use codeIPython.embedcode directly.p  pThe super duper plus specific usecase is that Im actually using codeanybox.recipe.odoocode, which wraps codezc.recipe.eggcode. The end result is that Im even more limited in how the script is built.p  pBasically I can just set the parameters that are passed into codeIPython.startipythoncode call as with the  codeargumentscode option of codezc.recipe.eggcode, and nothing else. In particular, I cant use the codeinitializationcode option of codezc.recipe.eggcode.p  pAnd Id rather not have to write my own entrypoint.p

Eventhough the keyvalue pair exists for this when it is sent, it does not recognize it and spits back that it was not supplied.p  pThe XML being sentp  precode        var requestXML           requestXML  ltsEnvelope xmlnsshttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoapenvelopegt         requestXML    ltsBodygt         requestXML  ltExecute xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comxrm2011ContractsServices xmlnsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstancegt         requestXML  ltrequest xmlnsahttpschemas.microsoft.comxrm2011Contractsgt         requestXML          ltaParameters xmlnsbhttpschemas.datacontract.org200407System.Collections.Genericgt         requestXML            ltaKeyValuePairOfStringanyTypegt         requestXML              ltbkeygtentityNameltbkeygt         requestXML              ltbvalue itypedstring xmlnsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemagt  Xrm.Page.data.entity.getEntityName         requestXML              ltbvaluegt         requestXML            ltaKeyValuePairOfStringanyTypegt         requestXML          ltaParametersgt         requestXML          ltaRequestId iniltrue gt         requestXML          ltaRequestNamegtnewStartCloningltaRequestNamegt         requestXML        ltrequestgt         requestXML      ltExecutegt         requestXML    ltsBodygt         requestXML  ltsEnvelopegt          var req  new XMLHttpRequest          req.openPOST, util.getBaseUrl   XRMServices2011Organization.svcweb, false          req.setRequestHeaderAccept, applicationxml, textxml,           req.setRequestHeaderContentType, textxml charsetutf8          req.setRequestHeaderSOAPAction, httpschemas.microsoft.comxrm2011ContractsServicesIOrganizationServiceExecute          var response  req.sendrequestXML codepre  pError message being returnedp  blockquote   psClientRequired field entityName is missing2147220989Required   field entityName is   missing20150805T205526.0627226Z2147220970System.ArgumentException   Required field entityName is missing20150805T205526.0627226Zp blockquote  pThanks for reading this far haha.p

Negative 314 pI have an app that has a single activity where all the screens are displayed as fragments.  p  pSo when most of the times  I am changing the fragment I add it to the back stack.

Negative 314 pI have a project that uses Prism 5 and thus Unity 3.5 and Enterprise Library 6. I have a WiX 3.9 installer project that deploys my product. Currently, I deploy the Prism 5 and Enterprise Library dlls into my program files installation folder. One of the 3rd party plugins that we use is still using Enterprise Library 5. This is causing an exception on startup where the plugin gets loaded with Enterprise Library 6 because it cannot find version 5. I dont have access to the 3rd party code to update it to Enterprise Library 6.p  pWhat are the best practices for deploying an application that uses Prism and Enterprise Library Should I be installing those files into the GAC Is there a wix bootstrapper package that I should be using Could I install both versions into the GAC and my program will use Enterprise Library 6 and the plugin would use version 5p

Also, I observed that protractor does not provide a stacktrace if other protractor tasks throws an error due to an error somewhere down the line it just hangs and times out.p  pI am using Protractor 2.1.0 and I am working with Angular JS pages.p  pI am specifically interested to know if it is a known issue to have silent errors in nested tasks with Protractor and is there anyway to solve itp

Negative 314 pIm new to Angular and states and wrapping my head around uirouter. Ive been doing it with jQuery for too long. In jQuery, I can load up something with ajax, then on the success, perhaps run another function. How do you do that with Angularp  pFor example, I have the following p  precodevar ivApp  angular.moduleivApp, [ui.router]  ivApp.configfunctionurlRouterProvider, stateProvider    urlRouterProvider.otherwise    stateProvider     .statehome,        url ,       templateUrl partialspartialhome.html         codepre  pWhich simply loads up codepartialhome.htmlcode into my codeuiviewcode. But how to tell it to run a function once that is done For example, I have codeauthenticate.jscode and a function codeauthenticatecode. How do I run authenticate once home state has loadedp  pAdditionally, can I tell angular to only load authenticate.js for this state Or should I have already loaded it in the template. I know that if I include the script in partialhome.html e.g. codeltscript srcauthenticate.jsgtltscriptgtcode chrome throws me an error about synchronous xmlhttprest being deprecated. So somhow in the config, can I declare authenticat.js as a dependency of the state or something like thatp  pAt the moment I have worked out I can do something likep  precodeivApp.controllerauthenticate, functionscope      start authorisation   authenticate   codepre  pAnd then define the controller authenticate in my uirouter states. But is that how its done It works basically. My authenticate function is doing things like changing things in the DOM, but I read controllers shouldnt be used for this.p  pThanks for any pointersp

Negative 314 pTake for example a view in cocoa or uikit.  It has a function setNeedsDisplay. You can call it as often as you want and once in each loop of the runtime it will update the view.p  pI want to do something similar.
