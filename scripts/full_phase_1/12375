My issues comes from how new accounts are set up differently on a dedicated server vs the AWS way.p  hr  pstrongMy first issuestrong p  pWhen I created a new account on my dedicated WHM, I was provided IP Addresses from the server farm that I assigned to newly created accounts. Once assigned, I can access the site with either the IP or the domain name. Now with this new AWS way, theres no info in the tutorials about how I obtain new IP Addresses. I tried adding a new local IP like 10.0.0.30 because it says its in NAT mode and use local IP and assigning this as a dedicated IP to the newly created accounts but I dont understand how anybody can access the site through that IP since its a local IP. So how do I access the domain through custom IP and domain like I did before I must be missing something fundamental.p  hr  pstrongMy second issuestrongp  pOn my dedicated WHM after I created a new account, I would typically go to DNS Functions  Edit DNS Zone and edit the zone to customize my nameserver as sop  pcodemynewdomain.com ns1.mynewdomain.com  ns2.mynewdomain.comcodep  pcodeanothersite.com ns1.anothersite.com ns2.anothersite.comcodep  pcodethirdsite.com ns1.thirdsite.com ns2.thirdsite.comcodep  pand then in my register I would add these custom nameservers into the register and point them to the dedicated IPs of each domain. But with the AWS way, the only way I was able to set this up was to use the new cluster nameservers as the nameserver for strongALLstrong accounts in this new WHM installation.p  pLike thisp  pcodemynewdomain.com ns1.awsnameserver.com ns2.awsnameserver.comcodep  pcodeanothersite.com ns1.awsnameserver.com ns2.awsnameserver.comcodep  pcodethirdsite.com ns1.awsnameserver.com ns2.awsnameserver.comcodep  pIs this the correct  the only way I can set up accounts now through this set up Is there a way to have custom nameservers names like I did in dedicated WHM p

Positive 12375 pIm attempting to run a webserver that uses an RDS database with EC2 inside a docker container. p  pIve setup the security groups so the EC2 hosts role is allowed to access the RDS and if I try to access it from the host machine directly everything works correctly.p  pHowever, when I run a simple container on the host and attempt to access the RDS, it gets blocked as if the security group werent letting it through. After a bunch of trial and error it seemed that indeed the containers requests arent appearing to come from the EC2 host so the firewall says no. p  pI was able to work around this in the shortrun by setting nethost on the docker container, however this breaks a lot of great docker functionality networking functionality like being able to map ports ie, now I need to make sure each instance of the container listens on a different port by hand.p  pHas anyone found a way around this It seems like a pretty big limitation to running containers in AWS if youre actually using any AWS resources.p

Positive 12375 pI was doing some experimentation with AWS Mesosphere and found something weirdp  pa. Make a small AWS Mesosphere cluster 1 master, 2 private slaves, 0 public slaves. Wait for all cluster to be created.p  pb. Go to AWS Launch Configurations, right click the SlaveLaunchConfig then Copy Launch Configuration. Then do not modify anything, just click on Create Launch Configuration. A new Launch Configuration will be created as SlaveLaunchConfigXXXXXCopy.p  pc. You may compare the 2 configurations, even the User Data is exactly the same.p  pd. Go to Auto Scaling Groups, select the SlaveServerGroup with the SlaveLaunchConfig, in the Details tab in the bottom click Edit. Then pick the SlaveLaunchConfigXXXXXXXCopy. Save.p  pe. Go to Instances then right click one of the slaves without a public DNS, Instance State, Stop. This will effectively terminate the instance because its part of an auto scale group. Once terminated, wait for a few mins then the Auto Scaling Group will kick in and create a new instance but with the new Launch Configuration.p  pf. The new instance will start, get to the Status Checks, then it will be terminated. Then the Auto Scaling will attempt to create another one, shut it down, terminate and again and again. p  pg. In the Auto Scale Groups, switch again to the original Launch Configuration, the next time the instance is created it will be fine.p  pSo in other words, I can only think that during the Launch Configuration Copy something went wrong, however I have checked all parameters and all looks the same.p  pAnyone in Mesosphere or AWS may shed some light pleasep  pThanksp  pGuimop

Negative 12375 pI am writing a program that will draw a solid along the curve of a spline. I am using visual studio 2005, and writing in C for OpenGL. Im using FLTK to open my windows fast and light toolkit.p  pI currently have an algorithm that will draw a Cardinal Cubic Spline, given a set of control points, by breaking the intervals between the points up into subintervals and drawing linesegments between these sub points. The number of subintervals is variable.p  pThe line drawing code works wonderfully, and basically works as follows I generate a set of points along the spline curve using the spline equation and store them in an array as a special datastructure called Pnt3f, where the coordinates are 3 floats and there are some handy functions such as distance, length, dot and crossproduct. Then i have a single loop that iterates through the array of points and draws them as sop  precodeglBeginGLLINESTRIP forpt  0 ptltnumsubsegements  pt      glVertex3fvpt.v  glEnd codepre  pAs stated, this code works great. Now what i want to do is, instead of drawing a line, I want to extrude a solid. My current exploration is using a cylinder quadric to create a tube along the line. This is a bit trickier, as I have to orient openGL in the direction i want to draw the cylinder. My idea is to do thisp  pPsuedocodep  precodePush the current matrix, translate to the first control point rotate to face the next point draw a cylinder length  distance between the points Pop the matrix repeat codepre  pMy problem is getting the angles between the points. I only need yaw and pitch, roll isnt important. I know take the arccosine of the dot product of the two points divided by the magnitude of both points, will return the angle between them, but this is not something i can feed to OpenGL to rotate with. Ive tried doing this in 2d, using the XZ plane to get x rotation, and making the points vectors from the origin, but it does not return the correct angle.p  pMy current approach is much simpler. For each plane of rotation X and Y, find the angle byp  parccosine difference in x valuesdistance between the pointsp  pthe x value depends on how your set your plane up, though for my calculations I always use world x.p  pBarring a few issues of it making it draw in the correct quadrant that I havent worked out yet, I want to get advice to see if this was a good implementation, or to see if someone knew a better way.p

Negative 12375 pAt our company we are developing an application that will consists of several modules. The architecture is pretty much defined but I have seconds thoughts about the presentationlayer and I would really like to hear your opinions. The architecture is as followsp  pForeach module we create several namespaces and those will be compiled in their own class library. So for our CRM module we create the followingp  ul liProductName.CRM.ServiceLayer holds the servicecontracts interfaces of CRM moduleli liProductName.CRM.ServiceLayer.Implementation implements the servicelayer interfaces of CRM moduleli liProductName.CRM.BusinessLayer holds the businesscomponents of CRM moduleli liProductName.CRM.BusinessLayer.BusinessObjects holds the businessObjects of CRM moduleli liProductName.CRM.DataLayer holds the DAO interfaces of CRM moduleli liProductName.CRM.DataLayer.SqlServer implements the datalayer interfaces of CRM moduleli ul  pWe create the same structure of class libraries for the modules Finance, HRM, Supply, etcp  ul liProductName.Finance....li liProductName.HRM....li lietc. I think you will get the idea for now li ul  pAlso we thought about the Crosscutting Concerns and for that we create the following namespaces and class librariesp  ul liProductName.Framework.ExceptionHandlingli liProductName.Framework.Loggingli liProductName.Framework.Securityli lietcetra...li ul  pSo that is how our architecture is so far and at this moment Im trying to find a proper way for setting up the PresentationLayer. For example, should I make a PresentationLayerlibrary foreach module ProductName.CRM.PresentationLayer, ProductName.Finance.PresentationLayer, etc.. And make an overall ProductName.PresentationLayerlibrary who has references to all the other Module.PresentationLayerlibraries. This overall ProductName.PresentationLayer will then have the LoginMainForm functionality and the ability to start forms that are implemented in one of the modules PresentationLayer. It will be like an entry point of the application to other modules.p  pOr...p  pShould I make just one ProductName.Presentationlibrary that contains all forms for all modules. By doing that that I can easly navigate to other forms and dont have to worry about references between modules when they are going to use each others forms sometimes they will do. p  pThe first solutions sounds good to me. However, when forms from different modules wants to navigate to each other.This kind of functionality will be tough to implement because only one of the two can have the reference to the other.p  pI would really like to hear your opinions about this issue Im dealing with and maybe someone could give me a proper solution or idea that I can use.p  pthanks in advance, Cheersp

Negative 12375 pIn an Object Oriented Program strongHow much abstraction is too much  How much is just rightstrongp  pI have always been a nuts and bolts kind of guy.  I understood the concept behind high levels of encapsulation and abstraction, but always felt instinctively that adding too much would just confuse the program.  I always tried to shoot for an amount of abstraction that left no empty classes or layers.  And where in doubt, instead of adding a new layer to the hierarchy, I would try and fit something into the existing layers.p  pHowever, recently Ive been encountering more highly abstracted systems.  Systems where everything that could require a representation later in the hierarchy gets one up front.  This leads to a lot of empty layers, which at first seems like bad design.  However, on second thought Ive come to realize that leaving those empty layers gives you more places to hook into in the future with out much refactoring.  It leaves you greater ability to add new functionality on top of the old with out doing nearly as much work to adjust the old.p  pThe two risks of this seem to be that you could get the layers you need wrong.  In this case one would wind up still needing to do substantial refactoring to extend the code and would still have a ton of never used layers.  But depending on how much time you spend coming up with the initial abstractions, the chance of screwing it up, and the time that could be saved later if you get it right  it may still be worth it to try.  The other risk I can think of is the risk of over doing it and never needing all the extra layers.  But is that really so bad  Are extra class layers really so expensive that it is much of a loss if they are never used   The biggest expense and loss here would be time that is lost up front coming up with the layers.  But much of that time still might be saved later when one can work with the abstracted code rather than more low level code.p  pstrongSo when is it too much  At what point do the empty layers and extra might need abstractions become overkill  How little is too little  Wheres the sweet spotstrongp  pAre there any dependable rules of thumb youve found in the course of your career that help you judge the amount of abstraction neededp

Negative 12375 pI have a big fat query thats written dynamically to integrate some data.

It turned out to be that they had some sales dating 20090229, an outofrange date. And yes, I know. Why was that stored as varchar Well, the source database has 3 columns for dates, Month, Day and Year. I have no idea why its like that, but still, it is.p  pBut how the hell would I treat that, if the source is not trustablep  pI cant HANDLE exceptions, I really need that it comes up to another level with the original message, but I wanted to provide some more info, so that the user could at least try to solve it before calling us.p  pSo I thought about displaying to the user the row number, or some ID that would at least give him some idea of what record hed have to correct. Thats also a hard job because there will be times when the integration will run up to 80000 records. And in an 80000 records integration, a single dummy error message emThe conversion of a varchar data type to a datetime data type resulted in an outofrange datetime valueem means nothing at all.p  pSo any idea  would be appreciated.p  pOh Im using SQL Server 2005 with Service Pack 3.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOk, so for what Ive read as answers, best thing to do is check each column that could be critical to raising errors, and if they do attend the condition, I should myself raise an error, with the message I find more descriptive, and add some info that could have been stored in a separate table or some variables, for example the ID of the row, or some other root information.p

Negative 12375 pMy question has to do with best practices and tools used for promoting application configuration data to a new environment as part of a typical testing cycle. The latter includes three environments, TEST, STAGING and PROD. Code and configuration changes are applied first to test and then promoted to STAGING and then to PROD once tests have passed at each step of the way. p  pPromoting a build of the software from environment to environment is straightforward. However, managing the promotion of the corresponding setup  configuration data changes is more challenging. The application is highly configurable and the configuration data is large  several GB stored in a few hundred Oracle db tables. p  pConceptually, the problem consists ofp  ol liKeeping track of all creates, updates and deletes to configuration data made within the application.li liTransferring those changes from one environment to anotherli ol  pDue to the large number of changes involved, doing this manually is time consuming and error prone.

This is an issue for AJAX websites anything with very dynamic content too, not just RIAs. And for static content, Google has been indexing SWF Flex content for some time now. Anyway, this is a problem for webSITES, not web applications two entirely different things. And deeplinking is not a problem for a Flash app, even basic research can dispel that myth.pli lipPerformanceinteroperability... FlashFlex is JIT compiled. If Silverlight isnt, Im sure it will be eventually. JavaScript is interpreted. Poor performance Really Flex runs in a platform independent strongvirtual machinestrong. Compared to the platform incompatibility problem within browsers for AJAX scripts, saying a VM approach is not as cross platform is emcompletely backwardsem thinking which completely ignores the browser wars and compatibility problems.pli lipAccessibility... Any large website needs to think about this. Contrary to what many believe, Flash has accessibility capabilitiesits not vastly harder like many claim, just different.pli lipPlayer upgrade nightmares... Not an issue for a emconsistentem backwards compatible platform like Flash. Actually the nonstandard, inconsistent DOM and DHTML browser incompatibility problems common in AJAX applications seem like the real nightmare in comparison.pli ul  pTo make it worse, the list of downsides such as OampM maintainability issues in response to new versions of browsers which break AJAX scripts is much longer than any list of issues with virtual machine application deployment. Why do so many hesitate to adopt 21st century innovation and abandon the 1990s legacy JavaScript era Is it just job security and learning fatigue from a rapidly evolving IT environment What is the difference between the software and hardware world where they are adopting virtualization technologies so readilyp

Negative 12375 pWeve implemented an audiovideo collaboration application on top of Silverlight, and are trying to tune it.  One of the issues were experiencing is an increase in stream latency whenever a packet is dropped we have to wait for the packet loss to be detected, requested, and then for the lost packet to be resent.  Of course, this plays hell with the consistency of our audio stream.  Wed switch over to UDP if we could, but Silverlight doesnt support that inbrowser.  Weve also disabled the Nagle algorithm, so in general, as soon as we submit a byte[] array to be transmitted, its transmitted, and in a single packet.  Im aware that TCP packet size  amount of data submitted, but with the Nagle algorithm disabled, its close.  And we have an adaptive jitter buffer, so we emcanem deal with lost packets, but a lost packet over TCPIP massively increases the amount of audio we need to buffer, and hence latency.p  pSo were trying to optimize how we send our packets, to see if theres any way to reduce the impact of dropped packets.  We currently have several competing solutions that were thinking about implementingp  p1 We could try to make our packets larger.  Currently, we send a mix of large 1024 byte video packets and small 70 byte audio packets over the same TCP stream.  But we could multiplex the audio and video data together, i.e., by attaching some of our video data to our audio packets whenever theres room.  This would make the individual packets somewhat larger, but would cut down on the total number of packets.p  p2 We could split the audio and video into two separate TCP streams.  This means that if the video stream stalled because of a lost packet, the audio stream wouldnt stall, and vice versa.  Of course, it would slightly increase the overhead, and wouldnt cut down on the overall number of packets sent.p  p3 We could inverse multiplex the audio into multiple separate TCP streams, and then reassemble them on the far side.  This would effectively allow us to fake a single UDP style of packet delivery.  If we had 8 audio streams, and one of them stalled because of a lost packet, the other streams would still be able to deliver their data on time, and all wed have to do is deal with 18 of the audio packets being unavailable until the stalled stream caught back up.  Thats not ideal, of course, but it might result in a better experience than to have the entire stream stall, and not being able to play emanyem packets until the lost packet is retransmitted.p  pAny thoughts on any of these possibilities Any other suggestions  Or do we just need to code up all three, and then test themp

Negative 12375 pWhat is the best way to permit C code to regularly access the instantaneous value of an integer generated from a separate Labview programp  pI have timecritical C code that controls a scientific experiment and records data once every 20ms. I also have some labview code that operates a different instrument and outputs an integer value ever 100ms. I want my C code to be able to record the value from labview. What is the best way to do thisp  pOne idea is to have Labview write the integer to file in a loop, and have the C code read the value of the file in a loop. I could add a second thread to my C code if necessary. Labview can also link to C  dlls. So I might be able to write a DLL in C that somehow facilitates sharing between the two programs. Is that advisable How would I do thatp

Negative 12375 pThere are so many tutorials that teach us to use for example some ORM directly with database, but in real life i cant remember a big project that was working directly with database and not with services, so the amount of that tutorials seems strange to me.br  Directly connected applications have real benefits in speed of data transitions between database and the app, and they do not have restrictions in functionality that appear because of service layersfor example lets take Entity framework and WCF Data servicesthat uses same entity data model itself. On the other side services solution is more secure and flexible, thats why iand i think many other programmers usually choose it for building large applications with some kind of common business logic...BUT Sometimes lose in speed is up to 10 times Thats just sad, application becomes less responsive than it could have been.br So the question i want to ask is can you share your own experience of building enterprise applications without the layer with webservices and when is it a good choicep

Negative 12375 pI have a requirement that certain attribute changes to records are not reflected in the user interface until those changes are approved. Further, if a change is made to an codeapprovedcode record, the user will be presented with the record as it exists before codeapprovalcode.p  pstrongMy first try...strongp  pwas to go to a versioning plugin such as codepapertrailcode, codeactsasauditedcode, etc. and add an codeapprovedcode attribute to their version model. Doing so would not only give me the ability to rollback through versions of the record, but also SHOULD allow me to differentiate between whether a version has been approved or not.p  pI have been working down this train of thought for awhile now, and the problem I keep running into is on the user side. That is, how do I query for a collection of codeapprovedcode records I emcouldem and tried writing some helper methods that get a collection of records, and then loop over them to find an approved version of the record. My primary gripe with this is how quickly the number of database hits can grow. My next attempt was to do something as followsp  precodeVersion.   whereitemtype gt MyModel.name, approved gt true.   groupitemtype.collect do v     like the reify method of papertrail   v.somemethodthatconvertstheversiontoarecord  end codepre  pSo assuming that the codesomemethod...code call doesnt hit the database, we kind of end up with the data were interested in. The main problem I ran into with this method is I cant use this finder as a scope. That is, I cant append additional scopes to this lookup to narrow my results further. For example, my records may also have a codecoolcode scope that only shows records where codecool gt truecode. Ideally, I would want to look up my records as codeMyModel.approved.coolcode, but here I guess I would have to get my collection of approved models and then loop over them for codecoolcode ones would would result in the very least in having a bunch of records initialized in memory for no reason.p  pstrongMy next try...strongp  pinvolved creating a special type of pending record that basically help potential changes to a record. So on the user end you would lookup whatever you wanted as you normally would. Whenever a pending record is codeapplycodeed it would simply makes those changes to the actual record, and alls well... emExceptem about 30 minutes into it I realize that it all breaks down if an admin wishes to go back and contribute more to his change before approving it. I guess my only option would be either top  ol lipForce the admin to approve all changes before making additional ones that wont go over well... nor should it.pli lipTry to read the changes out of the pending record model and apply them to the existing record without saving. Something about this idea just doesnt quite sound right.pli ol  pI would strongemloveemstrong someones input on this issue. I have been wrestling with it for some time, and I just cant seem to find the way that feels right. I like to live by the if its hard to get your head around it, youre probably doing it wrong mantra.p  pAnd this is kicking my tail...p

Negative 12375 pIm consulting on a large .Net winforms project that has to be able to run in Touch mode so it can be operated using a touch screen interface. The application architecture already contains scaling logic for enlarging the fontsdisplay on the standard .Net forms and controls and the custom controls also handles the scaling.p  pThe problem is that the application uses OpenFileDialog and SaveFileDialog which does not scale using the same logic which is essentially adjusting the size of the Font property on the control and the forms recursively. I believe that these dialogs are essentially native Windows dialogs and the OpenFileDialog class are really just wrapper classes that expose a standard .Net interface to interact with them.p  pOne solution could be to implement custom dialogs for these things, but that would probably be somewhat extensive work. What we really would like to do is to somehow scale the font size of this particular dialog perhaps through some PInvoke windowhandle magic p  pI know that one solution for touchenabling would be to adjust the font size of Windows in general, but that idea is not really catching on with this company, they would rather scale the app itself and leave the rest of the OS untouched.p  pSo, any experience or ideas as to how you could scale these dialogs to a larger font Or should we just bite the bullet and create custom dialogs for thisp

I have a class called codeRegexGroupcode which contains a list of codeRegexGroupcodes and codeRegexcodes.p  pI will make a gui frontend in order to utilize these classes and I started by making a Project class that will be serializable but I realized that a codeProjectcode class would be exactly the same as the codeRegexGroupcode. Is it good or bad practice to create a codeProjectcode class that is exactly the same as another just because they will be used in different contexts Or should I just stick with using the codeRegexGroupcode class Thanks in advance, ell.p  pnote I had trouble thinking of a title, please correct me if the use of the word semantics is incorrectp  pnote I am currently writing this in java but would this be an appropriate use of codetypedefcode in cp  pEdit The classes are literally exactly the same. Their implementation and interface is completely identical, there are no differences whatsoever.p

Negative 12375 pLets say I have a web app that calls out to a native app via a custom URL scheme, and after the native app has done its thing it returns to my web app by opening a callback URL.p  pThis all works fine when my web app is running in Safari. But what happens if a user saves the web app to the home screen creating a Web Clip In that case it runs in a separate process from regular safari, and has separate cookies and cache.p  pSo when the native app tries to return to the web app, the URL will presumably get opened by Safari, not by the Web Clip, and the session will be lost. And not just the session  all the page state, which in a rich Javascriptbased web app can be a lot of stuff with nontrivial startup time.p  pIs this assumption correct And if so, is there any way around it Is there some way to get iOS to try to open the URL with a web clip if installedp

Negative 12375 pI will explain my problem statement with the following illustration.p  pI have 4 machines, each running instances of my application which uses lucene for search. This means lucene indices have been created individually on all 4 machines and have been used internally for search using lucene in the respective instances.p  pNow, I am putting a server on top of all these 4 machines, so that its search feature could aggregate all the results from individual instances and give me a result. Hope the problem statement is clear.p  pNow the question, I am aware solr can read indices created by lucene. Does this hold good even for a distributed search Can solr just distribute the search over individually created lucene indicesp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. If this is not possible, I ll just have to go and rewrite the individual instances with solr and create indices suitable for distributed search.p

Negative 12375 pIs it possible to duplicate output from the perl crypt function using ColdFusion decrypt I am not familiar with encryption programming, but as I understand it crypt uses the DES algorithm unless otherwise indicated. Coldfusion can use the DES algorithm, but I dont know what other parameters to use.p  pAllow me to clarify my situation. I am working with a vendor supplied application written in perl. My local toolset is mainly ColdFusion. I would like to enhance the vendor supplied login function with a lost your passwordreset password function. I would prefer not to change the vendor source code, which I have access to, since it get upgraded regularly and I dont want to have to keep applying the changes. The best solution, for a host of reasons, is to emulate the perl crypt function output in ColdFusion so I can build the password reset function externally to the vendor application. It is admittedly an awkward and confusing situation.p  pI do not know if the emulation approach is feasible if not it is back to the drawing board.p

Negative 12375 pI am building a nodejs app with express and mongoosemongodb. p  pIn order to manage user roles a user may have 0n roles, I decided to implement a User schema and a separate Role schema and tie them together like DBRefs and using mongoose populate capability to get from one to the other easily. I chose this structure because I thought this was the best way to answer things like Get me a list of users that have X role or Get me a list of users whose Y role is set to expire soon.p  pThese are stripped down versions of my schemas for role and userp  precodeRoleSchema  new Schema    user  type Schema.ObjectId, ref User    type String   expiration  type Date, default  0    UserSchema  new Schema    email  type String, index  unique true          roles  [ type Schema.ObjectId, ref Role ]  codepre  pWith this, I am able to createfetchpopulate users and roles from within my express scripts without a problem. When I want to add a role to a user, I create the role, save it and then push it to the roles array of the user and then save the user. So, what happens in mongoDB is that each schema has its own collection, and they point to each other through an id field. p  pNow, what I want to do next is implement booleantype methods on my schema to check for rolerelated issues, so that I can do things like p  precodeifuser.isActiveSubscriber codepre  pI thought that I would be able to accomplish this simply by adding a method to my User schema, like thisp  precodeUserSchema.method isActiveSubscriber, gt   result  false   now  new Date   roles.forEach role gt     result  true  if role.type is SUBSCRIBER and role.expiration gt now  result codepre  pMy problem is that roles are coming out with empty attributes. I suppose it makes sense, since my user collection only has the id of the role but the actual attributes are stored in another collection.p  pSo, here go the questionsp  pa Is there a way to load the roles attributes from within my user schema method  I tried calling populate inside the method, but got an error that the user object doesnt know any populate method. I also tried doing a Role.findById from inside the method but also get an error tried with Role and RoleSchemap  pb In case there is not a way ... should I simply add the code to check in my scripts I hate having to put this kind of logic mixed with application logicflow. Is there a better optionp  pc Was it a bad idea to separate these collections in two Am I completely missing the point of NoSQL Would it be better if roles were simply an array of embedded documents stored as part of the user collectionp

Negative 12375 pWe have a Win32 application which displays tooltips on toolbars etc. The tooltips are very basic rectangles with incorporated text.

My database of choice is MySQL please advice if another database system is more suitable for the task, and I prefer to program in PHP but if I need to learn Python or any other language that will be more effective to this task, I will be willing.p  pI already searched at a hrefhttpanswers.semanticweb.com relnofollowanswers.semanticweb.comap

I have the example working for the most part.  I am able to push the refresh button, it parses the json and imports it in to the database.

If this call returns nil, then the code in MasterViewController adds it again to the database.  I have done some debugging and the serverId does get passed.  Also, the fetchrequest seems to be valid havent been able to debug it to be sure.  As you can see I have put a NSLog for the results, but it returns an empty result.  So, it then goes to if the results count is 0 which it is, it returns nil.  Thus my issue.  I dont see any where else where this issue could be a problem.  Any thoughtsp  pMike Rileyp

The class method codedictionaryForXMLDatacode allocs and inits the class. codeobjectWithDatacode then goes off and does the heavy lifting returning the codeNSDictionarycode object which gets returned to the caller.p  pThe confusing part for me is code[reader release]code before the return I understand this must happen because of the way codereadercode was created. My understanding of codeNSDictionarycodeis that all the objects will also be sent the codereleasecode message which means the object that were returning shouldnt have a retain count. Note that the object is created with a convenience method and only gets a retain count when it is added to the stack.p  pShould the return statement not be codereturn [rootDictionary autorelease]code. The problem I see with that is that there is no telling when coderootDictionarycode will be released and depending on the size of the XML file it could sit there clogging memory Or do I have it all wrongp

An example initialization of this class is herep  precodevar receiveDelimiter  Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes[END] var sendDelimiter  Encoding.UTF8.GetBytesrn var protocol  new DelimiterFramingProtocolreceiveDelimiter, sendDelimiter var server  new Serverprotocol server.Startport codepre  pThe protocol should be derived from the abstract class MessageFramingProtocol and the server should be able to use it to seperate messages. In the example above, the server should only fire its DataReceived event if the delimiter which is [END] is received and the arguments of DataReceived should only have the part of the message that is before the delimiter. If there are more bytes received after the delimiter, the server should store them and fire DataReceived only when the delimiter is received again. Server also should send the sendDelimiter after every message that it sends.p  pWhat I need is not this whole server class or any of the protocol classes. What I need is a template, a design advice. Assuming I have a property of type FramingProtocol called Protocol in the server class, how can I use it in receiving and sending operations in the Server class What abstract methods  properties it should have to provide the flexibility that you see above I should be able to write custom protocol classes that derive from FramingProtocol. They may use delimiters, lengthprefixing, both of them or other, custom approaches to seperate messages.p

Negative 12375 pI am having trouble with modrewrite in one directory on my server.  I use it elsewhere glitch free, but in this one new directory that is essentially just a wordpress site using permalinks, its not working. When I access this new site a hrefhttpwww.glutenfreegrapevine.com relnofollowhttpwww.glutenfreegrapevine.coma with Firefox on multiple computers, sometimes the pages come up and sometimes they hang, hang, hang when loading.  It can take a page 60 seconds to load.  It only happens in firefox. It happens to about 2 of every 10 requests.p  pI have narrowed down that the problem must be with our .htaccess file, because when I removed it from the directory the pages that could still be accessed werent rewrite pages worked and they didnt previously.  I also tested removing all wordpress plugins  no help.  And, I even had the problem when I tested a nonwordpress page in the directory and it still didnt load well all the time.  In a different directory, it worked just fine 100 of the time.   p  pHeres my .htaccess file p  precode BEGIN WordPress ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt RewriteEngine On RewriteBase  RewriteRule index.php  [L] RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule . index.php [L] ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule moddir.cgt    DirectorySlash Off ltIfModulegt    END WordPress codepre  pI just added the  part, because it was mentioned as a possible fix on some other threads.

Negative 12375 pNoob alert I started my current app as a simple test activity running the main routine. I now want to turn it into a proper app which requires a main menu as the mainactivity to call the sub activity with appropriate parameters.p  pIm used to simple coding where you just rename files, but in Eclipse you need to do things in particular ways Ive noticed. So whats the proper procedure for shifting my current mainactivity to a lower level and replacing the mainactivity Is it just a case of creating the lower activities and then copypasting code and .xml files, and then overwriting mainactivity Or should I refactor things in a particular order to keep the manifest and such in orderp

Negative 12375 pWe are trying to send uncaught GWT exceptions we are using GWT 2.5 rc1 to our server for logging and debugging purposes.  We want to deobfuscate the exception stack traces, otherwise it would be pretty much useless.p  pAfter some investigations, I found a hrefhttpwww.summatech.comblog201206117tipsforexceptionhandlingingwt7 Tips for Exception Handling in GWTa and a hrefhttpcode.google.compgooglewebtoolkitwikiWebModeExceptionsWebModeExceptionsa that contained valuable information.p  pSo we created a GWT UncaughtExceptionHandler that uses a custom RPC service to transfer the exceptions with their stack traces.  That works fine.p  pAs described in a hrefhttpcode.google.compgooglewebtoolkitwikiWebModeExceptionsResymbolizationDeobfuscationWebModeExceptions deobfuscation sectiona, we enabled stacktrace emulation with this in our GWT module p  precodeltsetproperty namecompiler.stackMode valueemulated gt ltsetconfigurationproperty namecompiler.emulatedStack.recordLineNumbers     valuetrue gt codepre  pNow our stacktraces look like this p  precodecom.google.gwt.core.client.JavaScriptException TypeError  Cannot call method pp of null     Unknown.aTUnknown Source174     Unknown.AVaUnknown Source501     Unknown.YFUnknown Source29     Unknown.LqbUnknown Source138     ... codepre  pIt seems ok to me because it contains the obfuscated method name and the line number which seems to be what is needed as described in a hrefhttpcode.google.compgooglewebtoolkitwikiWebModeExceptionsResymbolizationDeobfuscationWebModeExceptions deobfuscation sectiona.p  pThen we compile our GWT modules with the extra parameter to get the symbolmaps.p  pOur custom log service uses the symbolMaps directory to invoke com.google.gwt.logging.server.StackTraceDeobfuscator.  We use XGWTPermutation http header to invoke the deobfuscator.  I stepped in the deobfuscate method to make sure it could load the symbol map.  It could.  I validated that the symbolMap file name used was matching the .cache.js file name of the GWT module.  It does match.p  pSo basically, the service does thisp  precode Create the deobfuscator String dir  getSymbolMapsDirPath StackTraceDeobfuscator deobfuscator  new StackTraceDeobfuscatordir   request is the HttpServletRequest String strongName  request.getHeaderRpcRequestBuilder.STRONGNAMEHEADER   Deobfuscate the stack trace exception.setStackTrace     deobfuscator.deobfuscateStackTraceexception.getStackTrace, strongName   Log the exception logger.severeUncaught GWT exception, exception codepre  pThe end result is that the stack traces dont get deobfuscated.  Sometimes, some lines would get deobufscated with the wrong class and method name but nothing more.  When looking at the symbolMap file, the actual symbols in the stack trace dont match to any of the symbols in the symbolMap file.p  pAny idea what we are doing wrong herep  pstrongEDIT I tried RemoteLoggingServiceImpl and I get the same results.strongp

Negative 12375 pThe code below is something almost identical to what I used with ASI, but now I am using AFNetworking. My guess is that it is slow because it is running the success block on the main thread. I tried to set the successCallbackQueue to a new queue, but it does not seem to be working.

Negative 12375 pSo I am trying to add this tooltip, which gets resized based on the width of the text it contains. Tooltip is a div and it has another div containing the text.p  precodeltdivgtltdivgt tooltip text ltdivgtltdivgt codepre  pI assign text to it using javascript as mytooltiptext.innerHTMLsometext. The tooltip is hidden with display set to none, and becomes visible on mouse hover. I am trying to set its width before it even becomes visible based on the width of the texttext containing div. But when I try to get the clientWidth or scrollWidth of the text containing div, it comes out as zero. My understanding is that it is happening due to the element being hidden. I tried setting its display to block and visibility to hidden and then tried to get the requisite values, but to no avail. Is there a way to get the width of hidden text without making it visible firstp

Negative 12375 pI have about 100 textboxes on a page, and each textbox has its own corresponding value in an array, each textbox has a method which is invoked when the value in the textbox is changed, and updates the corresponding elements of the array, to reflect that value it has been changed to.

Negative 12375 pstrongTheres a few questions in here, so bear with me, and thanks for taking the time to read this...strongp  pI recently wrote an SPI master, and have fully simulated it to make sure it works as expected. From here Id like to use it in another design where Ive already got a 7 segment display component set up to take the value received from an ADC on the SPI bus, however I think Ive confused myself with things at this point.p  pI need to send a pulse with other parameters to the SPI master to initiate a transfer, and wait on a busy signal to be deasserted before I can send anything else. strongIm not really sure how best way to implement the SPI master within the new design.strong p  pemWould I use it in the design as a component is there a better wayem p  pIf it has to be a component, emis there any way I can set it up to directly output from that component to pins rather than me having to map to new inputsoutputs in the top level designemp  pFor example, I have SCLK, MOSI, MISO, and CS emCan I not just have them output directly rather than having to be mapped through the top levelem Seems like itd simplify the top level and make it less clunky.p  pAlso, emwould it be possible to set up a function to just say Send this data over SPI and then return whats receivedem p  pIm still getting my head around how to put these things together so helpexamples would be greatly  appreciated.

Negative 12375 pIve found that in many cases the designer in Visual Studio 2010 or in Expression Blend 4 will crash if, for example, a WPF UserControl contains a control does something in code based on the controls loaded event like transition to a different Visual State via a call like codeVisualStateManager.GoToStatethis, AfterLoaded, truecode. p  pMy typical approach to solving these designer crashes is use the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma834332718325codeDesignerProperties.GetIsInDesignModethiscode approacha in the controls contructorp  precodepublic MyControl       prevent designer crashes     if DesignerProperties.GetIsInDesignModethis         return      Loaded  MyControlLoaded     Unloaded  MyControlUnloaded     IsVisibleChanged  MyControlIsVisibleChanged      codepre  pThis approach targets both Visual Studio 2010 and Expression Blend 4 and enables me to have my design surface visible again.  However, it also removes any designtime preview that a designer might provide for me like with the abovementioned VSM state change on the loaded event.  Blend, in particular, is able to provide that preview for me in its designer if I switch to a different Blend tab and then switch back to the original tab I see the loaded animation run.  Furthermore, with some controls that I have not yet applied the above approach to, Visual Studio 2010s designer will crash, while Blend 4s designer will not.  Thus what I would like to do is check for strongonlystrong Visual Studio 2010s designer so that I can let Blends designer pass through and provide its previewing abilities.p  pThe benefit of this ability would be that I save time by not needing to build and run the application as often to see things like the loaded animation since Blends designer could give me its preview.    p

Negative 12375 pI build my first android app. I have a collection of lists that I display. Im wondering with a phones small memory size, is it a better design approach to go the database for my list every time or keep it in memoryp  pI do need to frequently reorder lists, so by just grabbing them out of the database in a sorted order it is pretty fast.p
Negative 12375 pI would like to have a set and have its elements have probabilities associated with them, so when I pick an element at random from the set, the distribution follows the probabilities associated with the elements. I would like to use that in a very small Java application that stores a list of movies I want to watch so I can have it suggest a random movie to me I always take hours to pick a movie otherwise. With each movie I want to associate the number of times the movie was suggested to me, which will be inversely proportionate to the probability that the movie is picked from the list for the next suggestion.p  pIs there a data structure that allows picking elements from it at random with a nonuniform distributionp  pIf not, whats the most efficient way of writing such a data structure I could of course always build an array, put every element of the list into the array often enough so the distribution of values in the array matches up the probabilities I want them to have, and pick a random element from that array but for large sets of movies, thats gonna be terribly inefficient. Another idea I had was encapsulating the element and the sum of probabilities of all elements up to it so the first element would be encapsulated as first, pfirst, the second as second, psecond  pfirst and so on, then pick a random number between 0 and 1 and do a binary search on a sorted list of those encapsulated elements. Does that sound sensiblep  pTLDR and somewhat abstract how do I map a nonuniform distribution to the elements of a set efficiently in Javap

Negative 12375 pThere are a number of popular frameworks around to provide data binding between objects and views. This is a great idea when the data changes, the view is updated automagically and vice versa. However, in mobile web apps, wrapped with Phonegap or equivalent, the app usually consists of one single html page holding multiple views usually divs used as containers. Only one view is displayed at a time, which means that only data bindings belonging to the current view need to be calculated and updated. If all views are updated all the time, it means a lot of unnecessary calculation and updates of invisible DOM elements. This should be avoided, since performance often is a problem in these apps.p  pWhat is the case with current JS frameworks How do they handle this I am especially interested in Angular.JS, but if there are other frameworks that handle the issue better, I am very curious to know. p

Negative 12375 pHow to partition a graph into possibly overlapping parts such that any vertex is contained in a part at which it has at least distance k from the Boundaryp  pThe problem arises in cases where the whole graph can not be loaded into a single machine because there is not sufficient memory.

Not using the provided AsyncVoidMethodBuilder.cs since it conflicts with the release version in mscorlib which may be part of the problem. I had to mark the provided Coordinator class as implementing System.Runtime.CompilerServices.INotifyCompletion since thats required by the release version of .NET 4.5.p  pDespite this, creating a console application to run the sample code works nicely and is exactly what I want cooperative multithreading on a single thread with await as yield, without the ugliness of IEnumerablelt based coroutines.p  pNow I edit the sample FirstCoroutine function as followsp  precodeprivate static async void FirstCoroutineCoordinator coordinator        await coordinator     throw new InvalidOperationExceptionFirst coroutine failed.  codepre  pAnd edit Main as followsp  precodeprivate static void Mainstring[] args        var coordinator  new Coordinator            FirstCoroutine,          SecondCoroutine,          ThirdCoroutine            try              coordinator.Start           catch Exception ex               Console.WriteLine Exception caught 0, ex       codepre  pI naively hoped the exception would be caught. Instead it isnt  in this single threaded coroutine implementation, its thrown on a thread pool thread and hence uncaught.p  pstrongAttempted Fixes to This Approachstrongp  pThrough reading around I understand part of the problem. I gather console applications lack a SynchronizationContext. I also gather that in some sense async voids are not intended to propagate results, though Im not sure what to do about it here nor how adding Tasks would help in a singlethreaded implementation.p  pI can see from the compiler generated state machine code for FirstCoroutine that via its MoveNext implementation, any exceptions are passed to AsyncVoidMethodBuilder.SetException, which spots the lack of synchronization context and calls ThrowAsync which ends up on the thread pool thread just as Im seeing.p  pHowever my attempts to naively graft a SynchronisationContext onto the app have been less than successful. I tried adding a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combpfxteamarchive2012020210263555.aspx relnofollowthis onea, calling SetSynchronizationContext at the start of Main, and wrapping the whole Coordinator creation and call in AsyncPump.Run, and I can Debugger.Break but not breakpoint in that class Post method and see that the exception makes it here. But that singlethreaded sync context simply executes in series it cant do the work of propagating the exception back to the caller. So the exception rocks up after the whole Coordinator sequence and its catch block are done and dusted.p  pI tried the even more niave approach of deriving my own SynchronizationContext whose Post method simply executes the given Action immediately this looked promising if evil and no doubt with horrible ramifications for any complex code called with that context active but this runs afoul of the generated state machine code AsyncMethodBuilderCore.ThrowAsyncs generic catch handler catches this attempt and rethrows onto the thread poolp  pstrongPartial Solution, Probably Unwisestrongp  pContinuing to mull, I have a partial solution, but Im not sure what the ramifications are as Im rather fishing in the dark.p  pI can customise Jon Skeets Coordinator to instantiate its own SynchronizationContextderived class which has a reference to the Coordinator itself. When said context is asked to Send or Post a callback such as by AsyncMethodBuilderCore.ThrowAsync, it instead asks the Coordinator to add this to a special queue of Actions.p  pThe Coordinator sets this as the current context before executing any Action coroutine or async continuation, and restores the previous context afterwards.p  pAfter executing any Action in the Coordinators usual queue, I can insist it executes every action in the special queue. This means that AsyncMethodBuilderCore.ThrowAsync causes an exception to be thrown immediately after the relevant continuation exits prematurely. Theres still some fishing around to do to extract the original exception from the one thrown by AsyncMethodBuilderCore.p  pHowever since the custom SynchronizationContexts other methods are not overridden, and since I ultimately lack decent clue about what Im doing, Id have thought this is going to have some unpleasant side effects for any complex esp. async or Task oriented, or genuinely multithreaded code called by the coroutines as a matter of coursep

Negative 12375 pTrying not to be too general herep  pI have an Android app in release which has a reasonably large internal Sqlite database  20  tables, 20 views and 10 triggers.p  pSome users have expressed the need to sync the data they enter into the app across the multiple devices they own, which is fair enough, as most apps seem to do this these days.p  pIve looked at a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comgooglegcmindex.htmlGCMa Google Cloud Messaging but, frankly, I dont have the time or financial resources to maintain my own servers to manage the backend single developer so Ive been looking for a 3rd party solution.p  pThe scenario would be that a user enters data into the app, it is stored in the local database, gets sent up to a master copy of the database in the cloud with a timestamp, and is available for another device of the same user to download and update that local database  and more complicated actions if triggers were involved.p  pIve looked at parse.com, stackmob and kinvey.com.

Negative 12375 pNow it seems like people like to use the MVP pattern in a bit different ways, some prefer the view to be totally unaware of the model and lets the presenter feed the data, while some prefer to just give the model to the view and let the view read its data directly from the model. Personally, I prefer the latter.p  pWhen reading up on MVP, it seems like all the examples concentrate on more or less CRUD views that work with one type of data. In the real world though, we have views that work with multiple datasources. For example, lets say we have a settings view that works with different type of data, such as SystemSettings, WorkflowSettings and UserSettings lets not argue about UX, this is just for the sake of an example. p  pMy first question is, how do you define a model for a view that works with multiple data sources I mean, does your view have methods for setting the different model setSystemSettings, setWorkflowSettings,... or do you wrap the actual domain models inside of a DTO and just have a simple setModelsettingsDto method in your viewp

Ive already checked out a hrefhttpsgithub.commaurycywStaggeredGridViewStaggeredGridViewa but it doesnt seem to accomplish what Id like.

And if the alpha did get changed when I toggle back I hardcode the alpha 255 elsewhere instead of 120 it doesnt go back to normal.p  pThis doesnt seem like the right way to do this anyways, it shouldnt be this difficult. It seems like there should be a single function call on an image to change the alpha but I havent found one yet.p

Negative 12375 pIm wondering if anyone could clue me in as to how to set up a search form in a Jquery Dialog. I want this to work through AJAX. I had tried using something like thisp  precodelt formtag teacherspath, method gt get, remotegt true do gt     lt textfieldtag search, params[search] gt     lt submittag Search, name gt nil gt lt end gt codepre  pThen on my controllerp  precodedef index     teachers Teacher.searchparams[search] end codepre  pAnd modelp  precodedef self.searchsearch   if search     findall, conditions gt [name LIKE , search]   else     findall   end end codepre  pNow, when i hit the submit button, since its got a remote attribute, it wont force the page to reload, but then the search thing doesnt happen either. I know im missing something, or probably im on the wrong track, so a hand is much appreciated here.p  pI tried my best to look for suitable answers to this questions, but ultimately couldnt find anything.p
Negative 12375 pI want to use some 3rd party modules that serve my needs for the most part, but to use them for my specific application, I have to make some changes.  More specifically I am using a module that provides ACL functionality, and in turn that module depends on a useramproleproviding module.  The modules themselves already have a database structure builtin, user object defined, role object defined, relationships between them defined, and so on.  The modules also have a captcha, some HTML files with a specific layout in them, and some other stuff.  p  pI have the need to use ACL but not all the other stuff.  So I have the need to customize the stuff in the modules to suit my needs, namelyp  ul lirestructure the database schema  add fields, change relationships between tables from one to many to many to many, add more tables, delete other tables, etcli liupdate HTML to add HTML code, jQuery code, etc.li liupdate the captcha code to use another classli liin the future maybe change the way the code generates ACL objects itselfli ul  pI am under the impression that the proper ZF2 way is to extend the module to modify it to suit my needs.  I do not see a way to easily extend these modules to make my changes, but maybe there is a way.  I am concerned that if I do extend it, my extension will be trying to undo or redo a lot of what the base modules already had.  It other words, it will become messy.  I might as well create my own ACL module.p  pAnother option is to edit the modules directly.  I do not want to edit modules code in the codevendorcode folder, as doing so is not advisable, but I basically want to take the modules asis and start hacking them up.  p  blockquote   pstrongQuestionstrong  How do I go about using the 3rd party modules ZF2 way, while allowing me to make extensive customizations to themp blockquote  pRight now I am thinking of just taking the modules asis, copying their content into my ZF2s codemodulecode folder and using them as modules internal to my own ZF2 application.  They will then be checked into the same version control as my main application code. p  pThe only possible downside I see is that if the module is updated by the original author and I want their updates, I will need to either manually copy them over and incorporate them, or use something like git patches, or codegit cherrypickcode. p

Negative 12375 pWhat am I missing I do not see an answer on stackoverflow, but could have missed it. It seems like the is operator should work i.e. evaluate to true for the case wherep  precodeshort j  1 int k  2   if j is int    Console.WriteLineall values of j will fit into k else    Console.WriteLineall values of j will not fit into k codepre  pI tried making the int and short nullable which did not work as well. The rationale for the conditional being true is that all values of short will fit into a variable of type int which is potentially wrong based on the result  i.e. the If j is in evaluates to false.

Negative 12375 pIm currently having an issue using a third party library that has broken pragmas that are pushing a lot of disabled warnings without correctly popping them so they stay disabled forever. I want the warnings to be enabled in order to detect any problems in my code that is including the third party files. Since modifying the third party source should be a last resort Id like to know if there are any other options to fix this.p  pThe only thing I can think of is to manually add codepragma warning popcode calls until the warnings start showing up again, but that seems really dirty. Is there some easy way to just pop everything that has been pushed all at once with a single call or something If thats not an option, are there any other solutions to this problem other than trying to figure out how to fix the broken pragmas in the third party source The third party source is very complicated so fixing it there wouldnt be easy.p  pEDIT It seems like theres no real solution for this other than fixing the third party code so I guess Ill just work with the dirty solution of adding a bunch of codepragma warning popcode statements in the files being worked on to make sure the warnings are enabled. It sucks, a lot, but I dont have the time to fix the third party code so itll have to do for now...Ill leave this open for a couple days and if no better solution comes up then Ill close it out somehow.p

This is good so far.p  pThe problem is, if I want to generate a list of assignments for the user that assigned them I want him to see only one row for a multipleuser assignment not one row for each recipient he sent the assignment to.p  pId love to be able to show the user a table likep  pemYou assigned form 1 To 50 users Due on April 25, 2014 Users Completed 10 View List of Usersemp  pAnd each assignee would see a table likep  pemUser 1 assigned you the following form form 1 Due on April 25, 2014, Click to Mark as Completedemp  pIm not sure how to go about this. If anyone could point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it.p

If i try debugging i get the Message  During startup program exited with code 0xc0000139. I googled the error code and Qt version 5.0.1 has a recorded bug though I used 4.8.6 i looked at it and it was about a secong MinGW compiler installed. I got a second one too so I uninstalled Qt removed the compiler deleted it since i never installed it just copied the files the I reinstalled Qt but still have the same problem Google doesnt say andthing else about that code so I wonder what the problem is  hope I wrote down all necessary infos if somethings missing just ask D thanksp  pps. this only happens with the 4.8.6 libs the 5.2.1 are working finep

Negative 12375 pIm running into an issue while using SqlBulkCopy to copy some data from Excel into a SQL Server table. Basically, I need to copy all the contents from some of the rows of the Excel file into the table. I had this working using straight SqlBulkCopy with no column mapping, but only after modifying the Excel file removing currently unusedempty columns. Due to our workflow, we need the Excel file to remain unchanged, so I tried using column mappings. I prefer to avoid working with a staging table because my SQL skills arent that great p  pMy code below works perfectly, except that it does not copy the final 11 columns. If i increase the final number 213 to 224 to try to include these, I get an IndexOutOfRangeException error.

Negative 12375 pI am new to JAVASCRIPT and this forum, well Ive read many posts here but this is my first post. Ive taken to using arrays as shown below to store the majority of data for a game Im building this goes especially for game statistics and coordinates. The example below is one of my smaller arrays. I keep them all in an excel spreadsheet which is particularly handy when I need to adjust some data as they are all concatenated automatically. So then I just copy the chunk of code and paste it in my javascript. This example mainly stores coordinates for the inventory slots and what kind of items they each hold.p  precodeENEMY INV ARAY COORDS function enemyinvcoordsname, x1, y1, x2, y2, item, state this.name  name, this.x1  x1, this.x2  x2, this.y1  y1, this.y2  y2, this.item  item, this.state  state  CREATE AND FILL INVCOORDSARRAY var ENinvarr  [] ENinvarr.pushnew enemyinvcoordsEI0, 420, 280, 460, 320, 1, false ENinvarr.pushnew enemyinvcoordsEI1, 465, 280, 505, 320, 2, false ENinvarr.pushnew enemyinvcoordsEI2, 510, 280, 550, 320, 3, false ENinvarr.pushnew enemyinvcoordsEI3, 555, 280, 595, 320, 4, false ENinvarr.pushnew enemyinvcoordsEI4, 600, 280, 640, 320, 5, false ENinvarr.pushnew enemyinvcoordsEI5, 645, 280, 685, 320, 6, false ENinvarr.pushnew enemyinvcoordsEI6, 690, 280, 730, 320, 7, false codepre  pIs there anything wrong with this method so far its been very handy when populating the screen and editing statistics as it allows me to keep my code short by using for loops that run through the required arrays. Do you have any advice of how I might be able to store these things in a better way I am in the long run planning to have this game communicate with a server of some kind but for the moment Im just designing game mechanics and UI interaction. I suspect there will be many rewrites before that ever happens though. Im probably asking this a bit late though, if this turns out to be a bad way to work then I feel another rewrite coming up.  Any advice you have would be most welcome.  Many Thanks and kind regards, p

Negative 12375 pI am trying to follow TDD principles in all my code base.  The frontend MVC and backend part are split, and frontend use their own Model objects, while backed use database objects which are then saved to a document database RavenDb.  p  pThis requires a lot of conversion from say codeCustomerModelcode to codeCustomerDatacode.  These are created independently from each other, so the strucutre might not match.  For example, the codeCustomerModelcode might be flat while codeCustomerDatacode has a nested object codeContactDetailscode.p  pCurrently, we are implementing two methods, one say codeConvertCustomerModelToCustomerDatacode and codeConvertCustomerDataToCustomerModelcode.  These are very similar, but inverse of each other.  Apart from this, these methods are also unittested.  Hence, similar code is created in four instances  twice for each conversion, and twice for each unit test.p  pThis is a big headache to maintain, and does not seem right to me.  Ive tried to use codeAutoMappercode, however I found it quite rigid.  Also, I could not find any way how I can unittest this. p  pAny ideas would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 12375 pFirst of all I apologize for the noobish nature of my question. I have tried to search the internet for a solution, so far with little luck. I therefore turn to the awesome people of StackOverflow, as this usually gets the problems solved quite fast.p  pI am trying to make a very simple login function for a website. It consists of a HTMLform and a php login script. The problem is that the username and password does not seem to get passed from the form to the login script. Starting with the form, it looks like thisp  precodeltform nameloginForm methodpost actionloginScript.phpgt     lttable styleposition absolute top55 left50 transform translate50, 50gt         lttrgt             lttdgtBrugernavnlttdgtlttdgtltinput nameedUsername typetext idusername autofocusgtlttdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttdgtAdgangskodelttdgtlttdgtltinput nameedPassword typepassword idpasswordgtltbrgtlttdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttd style fontsize 10pxgtGlemt din adgangskodelttdgt             lttd styletextalign rightgtltinput nameSubmit typesubmit valueLog indgtlttdgt         lttrgt     lttablegt ltformgt codepre  pSo the information i need in my login script is the username and password data. I try to obtain these with the filterinput since I read that this was safer than POST[]. In the login script it looks like thisp  precode Get username and password from post form eduser  filterinputINPUTPOST, username edpass  filterinputINPUTPOST, password echo eduser codepre  pThe echo part is just a temporary line, to check if there is indeed a username retrieved. So far this is not the case. So my question is, what the heck am I doing wrong p

Negative 12375 pI have started developing apps for Rails for last couple of months but there is always one question bugging me.

That was enough as user types didnt have anything which would be specific to them. Now I have to add many new columns which are only meant for certain user types. If I add those columns I will have many null values inside my users table. For examplep  precodecreatetable users, force true do t   t.string   username   t.string   password   t.boolean  admincolumn1   t.boolean  admincolumn2   t.boolean  editorcolumn1   t.boolean  editorcolumn2   t.boolean  publishercolumn1   t.boolean  publishercolumn2   t.boolean  designercolumn1   t.boolean  designercolumn2   t.boolean  admin,           default false   t.boolean  editor,          default false   t.boolean  publisher,       default false   t.boolean  designer,        default false end codepre  pThis means that if I create a user who is editor, I will have something like this inside my tablep  precode  username editorUsername   password editorPassword   admincolumn1 null   admincolumn2 null   editorcolumn1 editorData1   editorcolumn2 editorData2   publishercolumn1 null   publishercolumn2 null   designercolumn1 null   designercolumn2 null   admin false   editor true   publisher false   designer false codepre  pSo, as you can see I will have a lot of null values in each row.

Negative 12375 pI need to implement a system which does the followingp  ol liTransfer data to a remote place.li liOnce the data gets transferred fully, start a computation on the remote server.li liOnce the computation is done, fetch the resulting computed data back to the source.li liA web interface to trackedit the progress of each task.li ol  pI am thinking of using 1. Ruby on Rails for 4 2. Celery as the distributed solution. 3. Zmq to pass messages across to RoR app and in between the different categories of workers within celery described below.p  pTo decouple these components from each other, Im considering having 3 sets of celery workers, each belonging to a separate category  A. Sync workers, B. Render workers, and C. Fetch workers.p  pI wanna use zmq pub sub or broadcast model to pass messages around between these sets of workers and the web app so that they can be synchronised properly. For example B should only kick in once A is done. And C should follow B. p  pDoes this approach sound reasonable or can it be done better using perhaps just zmq or celery alone Should instead of these I be using the celery back end like redis or ampp  pReasons I wanna use celery is of course data persistence as well as a web interface to monitor the workers. p  pIm obviously relatively new to celery, zmq and distributed computation in general so any advice would be welcome.p  pThanks all.p

Negative 12375 pHello I have three datagridviews accross a Window, Each bound to seperate tables.

Negative 12375 pConsider processes all linked in a tree, either a formal supervision tree, or some adhoc structure.p  pNow, consider some child or worker down in this tree, with a parent or supervisor above it.  I have two questions.p  ol lipWe would like to gracefully exit this process if it needs to be killed or shutdown, because it could be halfway through updating some account balance.  Assume we have properly coded up some terminate function and connected this process to others with the proper plumbing.  Now assume this process is in its main loop doing work.  The signal to terminate comes in.  Where exactly or possibly the question should be WHEN EXACTLY does this termination happen  In other words, when will terminate be called  Will the thing just preempt itself right in the middle of the loop it is running and call terminate  Will it wait until the end of the loop but before starting the loop again  Will it only do it while in receive mode  Etc.pli lipSame question but without terminate function having been coded.  Assume parent process is a supervisor, and this child is following normal OTP conventions.  Parent tells child to shutdown, or parent crashes or whatever.  The child is in its main loop. Whenwherehow does shutdown occur  In the middle of the main loop  After it  Etc.pli ol

Negative 12375 pI have used a kafka Simple Consumer. All i want to do is that it will get message from the producer, then this data is processed in STORM and then after that will save to Cassandra.All goes well but the problem is that whenever i increases the maxReads value the kafka consumer goes to infinite loop and the data processing and saving to cassandra never gonna happen.So my question is what is the meaning of maxreads variable here and how can i make this consumer like when producer sends messages it fetch and give this tuples to storm bolt and when producer stops, consumer goes into halt and when after sometime if producer sends message then it will consume pass it to storm bolt and then goes to halt and this process will work further.p  pHere is my KafkaConsumerp  precodepackage com.sethiyaji.kafka  import

Negative 12375 pI have a movie clip on my timeline, which I then move on main timeline using classic tween from one side to another. I do not want that mc to loop so once the animation inside it finishes it should stop and all frames should be visible until the tween on main timeline finishes. To stop it from looping I added new keframe with stop at the end inside the movie clip. But it doesnt work, the movie clip keeps looping. I have changed the property type on first frame in the main timeline from movieclip to Graphic so that I can preview the movie clip in the timeline. In previous versions of Flash it worked always fine, but in CC the stop is ignored.  I know AS wont work with Graphics, but as far as the AS is inside that Graphic that shouldnt matter. Could anyone explain it to me and provide some solution pleasep

Negative 12375 pComing from a .Net background, and being pretty new to C and C, Im unsure about the implications of linking static thirdparty libraries when some of them are 64 bit and others are only targeting x86.p  pIn my case, Im doing some experiments with FreeGLUT, Glew and FreeType.

I want to build my application targeting x64 because Ill be doing a lot of work with 8 byte numeric values, but overall Im not too savvy with the differences in coding for x86 vs x64, or what it means to mix libraries from the two. I know that if I build my application targeting x86 then I clearly cant use x64 libs, but I have a feeling that the inverse is not true. Am I right Are there any traps to avoid Given that the Glew build I have is 32 bit but the FreeGLUT build is x64, can I expect them to work together at allp  pstrongEditstrong I found this page to be useful a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryew5tede7.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryew5tede7.aspxa  given that the active architecture affects how memory is allocated on the stack, it makes sense that trying to work with two different memory models in the same stack frame would not work.p

Negative 12375 pI am currently trying to rotate a positionVector 0,0,1 around the worlds xaxis and then rotate it back to its original position just trying to get it to work. I read into rotation matrixes and got it working sorta but i am pretty stuck now.p  pAs the image and code shows i create a cube at the starting point 0,0,1 and rotate it down in this case 30 degrees. But it seems to rotate more than 30 degrees when rotating clockwise. However when i rotate it back counterclockwise 30 degrees it does rotate the proper amount. Which results in it not ending up at its starting point as it should 0,0,1.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsCpKX.jpg altenter image description herep  hr  pI was wondering if any of you could shed some light on why this is happening and how to fix it.

Negative 12375 pMy problem is an Internet Explorer issue. I have an element, basically just a block, with the cssp  precodemdcard         minwidth 80         backgroundcolor fff      codepre  pAnd this element is full of data elements consisting of an icon and text. Each one is either a file or folder, and clicking a folder just navigates to that folders contents.p  pThese elements are using data binding and are dynamically updated when you click a folder so it removes the current contents and replaces the data with the opened folders new contents and for some reason this causes a problem in IEp  pThe codemdcardcode element despite having codeminwidthcode set to 80 will emsometimesem squash down to like an inch big on the screen when a folder is opened. Sometimes this happens only for an instant, and it resizes, and sometimes it sticks. But resizing the page will cause it to resize back to the intentded width.p  pI was thinking it was some weird interaction between angularjs and IE but Im wondering if this is an issue anyone has encountered or and ideas on why this is happening.p  pEdit On further inspection it seems to involve the codeminwidth 80code attribute. Changing it to codeminwidth 600pxcodeeliminates the problem.p

Negative 12375 pI need help optimizing my code or providing alternatives that will provide time efficient results. p  pI use Oracle 11GR2 11.2.0.4.0p  pI am writing a package that will take a clob that is filled with HTML source and grab the text between the html tags. The code that I have works as expected, but depending on the size of the contents in the clob, it can take forever to execute.p  pI understand that emregexpsubstrem using the emoccurrenceem parameter can be a bottle neck, and I believe if I can migrate it to using the empositionem parameter then it will run faster.p  pI have four functions in total, where two of the functions are to pipe the rows returned from an array of the functions respective list function.p  pEach list function emreturnrowslistem or emreturnrowslist2em will parse the HTML differently. For instance, emreturnrowslistem will use subquery factoring and emreturnrowslist2em will use PLSQL and variables to store the results from the emregexpsubstrem. I created the emreturnrowslist2em function to get an idea on which method would be the quickest. Both functions are to slow for any real use scenarios and are within 10 seconds of each other. p  pI need to somehow replace the emregexpsubstrem that uses the emoccurrenceem parameter to instead use the empositionem parameter using emregexpinstrem.p  pThe package below requires some source HTML code to work properly. I suggest taking any webpage and feeding the source into the a variable. I am using select statements to feed into a clob, because in reality the source will be larger than 32767characters and PLSQL wont accept string literals larger than that.p  pstrongemPackage Sourceemstrongp  precodeCREATE OR REPLACE package pipehtmlcontents as type rowst is record rec varchar232767  type trowslist is table of rowst index by binaryinteger type trowstab is table of rowst  function returnrowslist return trowslist  function returnrows return trowstab PIPELINED  function returnrows2 return trowstab PIPELINED  function returnrowslist2 return trowslist  end pipehtmlcontents  codepre  pstrongemPackage Bodyemstrongp  precodeCREATE OR REPLACE package body pipehtmlcontents as  function returnrows return trowstab PIPELINED IS lreturnValue trowslist begin lreturnValuereturnrowslist for i in 1 .. lreturnValue.count loop     pipe row lreturnValuei   end loop    return end  function returnrows2 return trowstab PIPELINED IS lreturnValue trowslist begin lreturnValuereturnrowslist2 for i in 1 .. lreturnValue.count loop     pipe row lreturnValuei   end loop    return end  function returnrowslist return trowslist IS lreturnValue trowslist pclob clob ctemp clob     lcount                        plsinteger  0        begin    for lrec in  with src    as select select SOURCE from temp as html from dual Source HTML Code goes here.

So far, searching for answers on Stack Overflow and Google has proved fruitless, and Mozilla host their own discussion list and bug tracker which do not seem to be very accessible to the general public.p  pThe l20n project appears to be in a state of flux, with the supposedly ES5compatible webcompatl20n.js in the version that I am using 3.0.5 requiring a Polyfill due to its use of Array.from additionally the examples and learning resources do not seem to exactly match up to how the framework should be used.  The source code is completely undocumented but despite that, most of the understanding that I have of the framework so far has been gained by looking there.  I cannot see any filtering of attribute names in their code, so I feel that this issue may be due to the need for elements and their attributes to be registered with the browser before l20n makes a pass at the data attributes.p  pThanks in advance to anyone who may be able to help.p

I would like to compute the styleClass property for the button, so I identify which one I have clicked by adding active to the styleClass.p  pUnfortunately when I set the active ID ID of the button selected in a viewScope variable and compare that with the ID computed in the styleClass they differentiate.p  pThe difference is that the value for the ID in the viewScope seems to contain an additional iterator value e.g.p  pviewid1id81repeat20button2 or viewid1id81repeat21button2p  pand the computed value in the styleClass not e.g.p  pviewid1id81repeat2button2p  pThis last ID value is the same for all the other buttons.p  pFor computing the ID value I usep  pgetComponentbutton2.getClientIdfacesContextp  pas mentioned by Tim Tripcony a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10147355gettingtheclientidofanxpagesbuttonprogrammaticallyGetting the clientId of an XPages button programmaticallyap  pWhat am I doing wrong or how can I compute the styleClass property properly in SSJSp
Negative 12375 pI was creating an animation using recursion showing the process of Hanoi Tower. Here is my complete code, my question is when I using main to call the codemovecode function, everything works fine, but when I tried to use a button, it does not work. Console output indicating the codemovecode does getting called but the window does not get refreshed.

Negative 12375 pTrying to brush up on my BigO understanding for a test A very basic BigO understanding required obviously I have coming up and was doing some practice problems in my book. p  pThey gave me the following snippetp  precodepublic static void swapint[] a      int i  0     int j  a.length1      while i lt j              int temp  a[i]         a[i]  a[j]         a[j]  temp         i         j       codepre  pPretty easy to understand I think. It has two iterators each covering half the array with a fixed amount of work which I think clocks them both at On2p  pTherefore On2  On2  O2n2  Onp  pNow please forgive as this is my current understanding and that was my attempt at the solution to the problem.

Im wondering what would be the correct way of implementing a stream for other types. I do not want to allow text but other forms of binary inputoutput I have specific formats.

These streams will sendreceive segments and only segments over a WiFi connection as these are used in the communication protocol. Sending anything else would break the protocol.
