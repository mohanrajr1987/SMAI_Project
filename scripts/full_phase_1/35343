Positive 35343 pI am working on a project which involves linking task list from SharePoint 2010 to MS Access for updating item details based on business requirements. There are filters based on Created By and Assigned To columns  [Me] which restricts users to view tasks not assigned or created by them. This works when the user  opens up the SharePoint task list on browser with applied filters. However, when this task list is linked using MS Access, a user is able to see all items under the linked table which bypasses the filtering restrictions. How do I achieve the filtering logic to be applied in MS Access as well, any help is greatly appreciated.p

Positive 35343 pI am having an issue with MS Access 2010 opening a large SharePoint linked list.  It was working fine on a Friday afternoon around 430pm, but then, the following Monday morning, I began getting an error when trying to open a large SharePoint linked list.  Not all of the linked lists, just the largest one, which has 8036 records the view threshold is 10000.  MS Access appears to open the list,but then the wait cursor appears and then after some time an error message Cannot connect to the SharePoint site  displays and all of the displayed data is removed.p  pIve asked our sys admins if there were any group policy or system updates that were pushed and they were not aware of any but that doesnt mean there werent any.p  pHere is a screencast video of the problem that I am having a hrefhttpsyoutu.beRYSmgL0gc relnofollowhttpsyoutu.beRYSmgL0gcap
Positive 35343 pI ran to an uncommon situation a few days back. All my intranet strongSharePoint site users are their permissions set to Readstrong.p  pAs things arent enough critical, afterward all my site collection administrators accounts are in full read permissions as well.p  pUsing my favorite search engine, I have put a script together which will allow me to explicitly set owners and secondary owners to all my SharePoint Web site, as shown belowp  precodeowner  ReadHost Enter site collection owner username  second  ReadHost Enter site collection secondary owner username  sites  GetSPSite Limit all foreach site in sites      WriteHost Setting site.url owner to owner and secondary owner to second     stsadm o siteowner url site.url ownerlogin owner secondarylogin second  WriteHost Done site.dispose codepre  pThis little script worked fine for all web site except for the more important one. The codefailedspsitecode throws an error  p  blockquote   pactions on this web site has been blocked  Contact administrator to resolve the problem.p blockquote  pI have no logs whatsoever, to help me figure out where the problem lies, nor any events logged when the errors is thrown. So all administrator accounts cannot not edit user and group permissions in the codefailedspsitecode web applications. However, when checking administrator rights in Central Administration GUI I can see that the permissions level are emFull Controlem .p  pMy administration center and FWE server are running on the same box while the SQL server is on another server. Its a SharePoint 2010 SP1  environment with only one server in the farm.p
Positive 35343 pI have two environments and authoring farm and a production farm using content deployment. The production farm is set up using host header site collections and the authoring is set up using path bases site collections. I am using SharePoint 2010 with a custom developed branding solution. The only thing the custom code does is use a module to add files to the style library in a folder structure for our designers.p  pNormally when not using a module to place assets and putting the style assets in a style library content deployment changes strips out the sitessitecollection, but, When using a module the path does not get changed when content deployment bring the assets down and the css does not have the proper path to images which is the effect of my problem. To fix this I have had to go into the production site remove the assets, remove the assets in authoring and add them back in then run CD and the assets have the correct path.p  pDoes anyone have any idea what might be causing this andor run into a similar problemp

Positive 35343 pMy goal is to modify list items including display names, filenames, titles, URLs, etc throughout our SharePoint site.  This is needed due to a major business reorganization which has altered the business hierarchy and project names.  We have way too many files and URLs to edit them manually.  We need to perform the equivalent of a searchandreplace operation on all list items throughout the SharePoint site.  So far, the code examples weve discovered for updating list items have all been simple setaflag styles of operations using the same values for all list items, but we need to read the contents of each list item and use those values as part of the newlyupdated values unless SPServicesSharePoint has some equivalent of Unix grepsed commands.p  pFor development and testing, I have added the following HTMLjavascript code into a Content Editor Web Part CEWPs HTML section which is located on my MySites Contents page because I really do not want to experiment against live production data, and this MySite also includes lots of textDOCPPTXLS files with various namestitlesetc to search through.  For now, this script attempts to modify a single file named test4 blah.txt eventually I will replace this CAMLQuery to modify multiple sets of files.  The javascript executes without errors, successfully finds the queriedfor list items, and displays the supposedlymodified list items in the GUI with the supposedlymodified new values i.e. everything looks successful from the users point of view of the GUI, but unfortunately behind the scenes, the actual list items in SharePoint are never actually modified.  No error messages were printed into the javascript console when this script executes.  In the codes UpdateListItems section, we have tried lots of variations on internal staticnames, displaynames, etc with no success.p  pWe are using Microsoft SharePoint 2010, SPServices jquery.SPServices2014.01.min.js, and jQuery jquery1.11.0.min.js.

Positive 35343 pI am here to give a simple workaround for SharePoint Email reminders. creating subscriptions in SSRS will do the trick. Here are the stepsp  p1 Create a blank report in SSRS and name it something like Sharepoint Subscriptions.p  p2 Create a subscription for that report.p  ul lipDonot forget to stronguncheckstrong  Include report and Include Link options in the subscription because here we are sending email to users and link is Sharepoint listsite but not anything related to report. Choose Select Schedule and you are done.pli lipThe above solution worked like a charm for me. This is much simpler than Windows Task Scheduler and much much more simpler than writing code.pli ul  pNote  The above workaround wont work if the requirement is to send reminder email workflows for particular item. In this case, i will create a view say Expiration Date  7days and send users link to this view  following the above steps i mentioned so that users will have one link for all items that are going to expire in 7 days.p  pPlease ignore this if you already know the workaround i mentioned.p

Negative 35343 ul liAny personal experience in overcoming web application performance hurdles li liAny recommended strategies for improving the performance of a datadriven web application li ul  pMy development team works on a web application JSP reports, HTML, JavaScript that uses an Oracle database PLSQL. The key functionality the application delivers is in reporting, where a user can get PDFs of reports at a high level and drill down to lower levels of supporting details. p  pAs the number of supporting detail records has grown into the millions, the performance of the system has significantly degraded. Based on our current analysis of the metrics, the bottleneck seems to be in the logic hitting the DB and the DB performance. Changing the DB model and redoing some of the server side logic is currently being explored.  p  pPartioning, indexing, explain plans, and running statistics are things that have been done on the DB side to try to help improve performance. While theyve helped, they havent solved the issue satisfactorily. The toughest part in analyzing performance data is that the database and web servers are remotely administered by a different part of the IT organization, so the developers dont have regular, full access to see whats going on especially in the production environment, which is not mirrored exactly in any other developmenttesting environment.  p

Negative 35343 pI have a simple WPF application that contains a user control that is animated in and out by a pair of storyboards on the main window.  I am animating the user controls opacity, scaletransform.scalex and scaletransform.scaley to pop it in and out of view.  It looks cool except for the first time it runs.  The animation is set to take 310 of a second, though I have increased this during my testing.  Ive tried setting a default value at a fraction of a second in to see if there is a problem where the values of the properties Im animating arent defaulting as expected.  That did nothing.  I even explicitly call my hide animation on window loaded to see if this would help me set my default values, but that didnt work either.  Is there some initialization that the runtime is doing the first time I fire the animation  Is there a way I can explicitly call that kind of initialization before showing the UI  The symptom is that the control isnt even visible until about 210 of a second into the first animation.  Sometimes its longer and the control shows up after its been fully animated opacity and size are their final values when it finally shows up.p

Negative 35343 pIm not positive I have the right architecture for this problem.  Lets say I have a Person object that has 1 or more Attribute objects associated with it.  For the interface, I have a list of Person objects, a Person view, and another control with tab pages that represent each Attribute object associated with that person.  How would an MVC architecture behind that be constructed  p  pCurrently, I have a single model for a Person that has a list of Attribute models.  I have a controller for the view, and then I was going to make a controller for the AttributeView that would have subcontrollers for each Attribute attached to each Attribute model in the Person model... I think I can handle all the appropriate interactions with that architecture, but Im not sure that its the best implementation.  Does that sound reasonable, or is there a better way to tackle thisp  pThanksp

Negative 35343 pIve recently been playing around with PostSharp, and it brought to mind a problem I faced a few years back A clients developer had produced a web application, but they had not given a lot of thought to how they managed state information  storing it dont ask me why emstaticallyem on the Application instance in IIS. Needless to say the system didnt scale and was  deeply flawed and unstable. But it was a big and very complex system and thus the cost of redeveloping it was prohibitive. My brief at the time was to try to refactor the codebase to impose proper decoupling between the components.p  pAt the time I tried to using some kind of abstraction mechanism to allow me to intercept all calls to the static resource and redirect them to a component that would properly manage the state data. The problem was there was about 1000 complex references to be redirected and I didnt have a lot of time to do it in Manual coding even with R proved to be just too time consuming  we scrapped the code base and rewrote it properly. it took over a year to rewrite.p  pWhat I wonder now is  had I had access to an assembly rewriter andor Aspect oriented programming system such as a PostSharp could I have easily automated the refactoring process of finding the direct references and converted them to interface references that could be redirected automatically and supplied by factories.p  pHas anyone out there used PostSharp or similar systems to rehabilitate pathological legacy systems How successful were the projects Did you find after the fact that the effort was worth it Would you do it againp  pstrongUPDATEstrong See a hrefhttpaabs.wordpress.com20091022canaophelpfixbadarchitectures relnofollowthisa blog post for more discussion.p

This breaks the theme for those elements and, for example, produces black text on black background where the text would otherwise be white.

Negative 35343 pTLDR The question isp  ul liDo you know of a crossplatform library that I can use from C to map MIME types lt file extensionsli ul  hr  pMy application is supposed to handle image and video files alike. I try to be as platform agnostic as possible, so I chose to use Qt4 as my main library. The Phonon framework for handling video files and QImage for handling images, obviously can both report which file formats they support. Phonon will return a list of MIME types that is supported by the installed backend and QImage expresses the supported file formats with a list of file extensions.p  pThe application should find out from a codeQString fileNamecode whether to create a codeVideoObjectcode or an codeImageObjectcode from it. My approach is to create a codemapltQString, FuncPtrgtcode that returns the appropriate factory method for creating the correct object. For the string I currently use the file extension, because it is very easy to infer the file extension from the file name. But now I do not have an elegant way to register the supported video file types, since I only know their MIME type.p  pIf I used the MIME types for the key in my codemapltQString, FuncPtrgtcode, I would be faced with the problem how top  ul lia map the file name to a MIME type no clue how to do that platform independently and extensiblyli lib map the file extensions provided by QImage to MIME typesli ul  pI know that, according to my research up to now, many people suggest to use the Apache mime.types file, which will preclude me from supporting new file formats WebM, WebP, ... when the client updates the back ends. p  pOther suggestions that I have found is to scan etcmime.types on Linux I could do that or to query the registry on Windows no clue how to do that. But this seems very limited to those two platforms, what about Mac OS X, etc.p  pIn addition to the above stated question I also welcome other suggestions in any shape or form. Perhaps I am missing something brain dead obvious.p

My question is, how would you go about debugging this failure  All I see in the Eclipse Debug pane is a RuntimeException.  I see LogCat has a bunch of messages, but its huge and Ive searched it but cant find anything to indicate whats wrong or where in my code the exception happened.  I cant find a way to display the message inside the RuntimeException or a stack trace to know which line of code initiated the exception.  p  pI assume there must be better ways to use the tools to find errors, but Im new and cant seem to figure out a better way to debug besides wrapping everything I code in a trycatch.  I would have expected to find a message in LogCat generated by the throwing of the exception.  I would have expected the Debug window to allow you to inspect the exceptions contents.  Im not saying that such techniques dont exist, Im saying Im having trouble figuring out as a beginner how to debug and asking what techniques do exist and how do I use them  p  pSo, simply putp  ul liHow would you find this error if you didnt already know what was causing it  li liWhat techniques would you use to find out the root cause  li liHow would you go about inspecting the Exceptions details  li liGenerally, how do you find problems in your Android code using Eclipse  li ul  pMultiple suggestions and discussion are welcomed.  p  pI would have included my LogCat contents, but its so large thats not reasonable.  You should be able to easily reproduce this yourself, so I left it out.  It is possible something is in LogCat to help me, but because its so large with even running a small program, I would need a hint as to what to search for and how to interpret it when hitting an exception thrown from an API call.  I see other posts that state something should be in LogCat, which while might be true, Im not finding anything myself.  If you think something should be in LogCat, please run the test yourself and copy the lines into your response that I should be finding.  p  pThanks.  p  pp  pSummary techniques list so far is as followsp  pInvasive Techniques 1. Place a Toast in code locations where you want to see you youve executed. 2. Place trycatch around code where you think theres a possibility of an Exception being thrown.  3. Comment out code and recompile and retest.p  pNonInvasive Techniques 1. Use the debugger. Breakpoints, variable inspection... 2. Monkey stress tester. 3. Download Android source library. 4. Use LogCat filters to see if a Caused By is listed.p  pUnclear if Available 1. Debug version of Android library that has additional logging, assertions or other additional help.  2. Ability to inspect an Exception in Eclipse through the Debug pane or other techniques. 3. A way to define a more global trycatch exception handler. 4. Ability to debug through the Android library source code.p  pNot Available 1. A noninvasive way to view the contents of an Exception or where the Exception happened.p

Negative 35343 pIm working with really long URLs or more specifically URL Queries and Ive encountered a problem.p  pIf I do a lt a href.. with the URL that Ive appended to the bottom of this post and

me to a new instance of that page, it does nothing, why would it do that I want my links to work no matter what instance of the page it is.p  pSo basically I have a page with a link that links to the

Negative 35343 pI have a change password page that needs to hash any passwords entered on the page via Javascript before sending. To complicate it, the page is loaded via a jQuery load call, and is submitted by a jQuery.Form ajaxForm call. Had everything working in MVC2, but MVC3 is giving me trouble.p  pThat is, I have a page with a Change Password link that when clicked, loads the change password page into a jQuery modal popup, then the form on the change password page gets submitted via the jQuery.Form library Essentially just wraps a .ajax call, and returns its result into the modal same modal popup.p  pEssentially, I have a model with two properties, OldPassword and NewPassword. I have two hidden fields generated by by view for these. They hold the hashed value of two other fields, PrehashOldPassword and PrehashNewPassword, and get updated via keyup events I know, this means it does a whole SHA256 hash on every keyup... inefficient, but got the job doen for testing. The key here is that the regex validation and required field validation needs to be executed on these Prehash fields, which exist on the client side only As obviously I dont want to transmit these fields to the server in any way.p  pSo I manually create these two and add on the dataval attributes to the elements, i.e. they are NOT generated by the MVC helpers, etc. I am guessing that this is where Im missing something. When the form submits with all fields empty, all of the errors popup that should, but the form goes right ahead and submits anyway. p  pp  pSo the things Ive triedp  pYes, the unobtrusive library parse method already gets called to parse the AJAX loaded form contents, and it appears to get all of the data validation stuff correctly, since I see the errors show up as fields blur, and when I hit submit before the ajax request completes and replaces the content of the popup.p  pPossible note this call to the unobtrusive librarys parse method happens AFTER the AJAX successfully loads the change password page into the popup... the AJAX form submit binding is put on document.ready of the loaded content, ergo, the AJAX form submission binding MAY be binding prior to, and thus firing before, the validation calls that the parse method may bind to the submit event... p  pHowever, 1 I am doing this same sort of thing in other places without issue, the ONLY DIFFERENCE being that I am manually putting these dataval attributes on elements I am creating manually And 2, if I cause some kind of error on the OldPassword or NewPassword fields, i.e. a required field validation error by not loading a value into them, they display their error, and successfully STOP the form from submitting through the jQuery.Form method.p  pSo I think something has to be wrong herep  precodeltinput idPrehashNewPassword typepassword namePrehashNewPassword datavalrequiredThe password field is required. datavalregexpatternlt RegexHelper.PasswordRegularExpression gt datavalregexlt RegexHelper.PasswordRegularExpressionError gt datavaltrue gt codepre  pI know that jquery.validate is getting the rules right, since I DO see the errors. Its just not stopping the form from submitting when their is an error in these manually generated elements, unless I do something like this, and add a presubmit callback on the forms AJAX submissionp  precode        ChangePasswordForm.ajaxForm             beforeSubmit function   if ChangePasswordForm.valid  return false  ,             target overlay          codepre  pWhile this works, it is kind of ugly and I believe it causes the validation to be called twice... Not a huge deal, but less than ideal. So is there some other call that I need to make in the unobtrusive library to bind thesep

Negative 35343 pFor the first time Ive encountered an infinite loop in a Haskell program Im writing. Ive narrowed it down to a quite specific section of code, but I cannot seem to pinpoint exactly where I have a nonterminating recursive definition. Im vaguely familiar with trace and history in GHCi, but the problem is that some branches of my code involve quite a bit of recursive modifications of a codeData.Map.Mapcode in the sense that the map codexcode is obtained by codeadjustcodeing something in the map codexcode based on values in another map depending on codexcode. The specifics dont matter here, but as you can probably tell, if this happens in an intertwined recursive way, my call history gets completely bogged down in all the various comparisons involved in map codelookupcodes, codeadjustcodements and codeinsertcodeions.p  pCan anyone recommend a more efficient way to locate infinite loops It would, for example, help a lot to restrict the call history to calls from a single source file.p

Negative 35343 pMath has come on my way again and has defeated me. I need your help to regroup and attack again.p  pstrongWhat Ive gotstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5TLR9.png altenter image description herep  pIve got a surfaceview and a circle as a bitmap. I need to rotate the bitmap as the user moves the finger around the circle edge. The faster the user slides, the more I need to rotate the image. Seems simple but not really easy to implement. p  pstrongWhat I needstrongp  pI need to calculate the angle on which to rotate the image on onDraw event. From what Ive thought so far I need two things  the angle between new touched point and the old one. Ive done a simple function that takes care of thisp  precode     private int getAngleBetweenTwoTouchedPointsdouble oldX, double oldY, double newX, double newY                return int Math.absMath.atan2newY  oldY, newX  oldX       codepre  pthe angle returned by this varies from 0 to 1 and I believe it is correct. By incrementing the image rotation matrix angle by this value I get a slow rotation, basically by 1 unit. So, there is a chance to work, but not ok yet.   so, the second thing I may need is the speed with which the user slides the finger around the screen. So basically something like thisp  protationAngle  angleBetweenTouchesspeedp  pSpeed, or velocity as I saw it named is the problem in my case, considering that I dont move only on X or Y but around the circle. I have no idea how to calculate it. I saw VelocityTracker on Android help but I dont know how it could help. p  pSo to recap I need to be able to rotate the image as the user moves the finger around the image border. Even simpler, when the user stops sliding, the pixel of the image that was below the finger on slide start should be the same when the slide stops. p  pAny help is greatly appreciated. Thank youp

Negative 35343 pWe built a website for a client using Wordpress. We used a testing server which always works well. Wordpress was hosted as a subdomain, i.e. a hrefhttpwordpress.ourcompany.com relnofollowhttpwordpress.ourcompany.coma. I have direct and full access to the server. In the etcapache2sitesavailable directory the file describing the site in question uses the final name a hrefhttpclientsite.com relnofollowhttpclientsite.coma as ServerName, our temporary subdomain under which we have been building is a ServerAlias.p  pWhen we were almost ready, we of course asked the client who already had a website for their domain login. We changed the DNS like always. It resolved, the site worked well. Although Wordpress kept redirecting of course to the subdomainvariant, we could enter the site with the full domain.p  pNow comes the culprit. I changed the Wordpress settings siteurl and home to match the new site. The frontend works brilliantly. However, the backend is unreachable as long as the settings are in this way. The login page shows up, but just redirects back to itself.

Negative 35343 pI have a data structure which will have Strings as the key referencing an integral value.  I cannot fit all the String keys into memory.  My most important focus is to perform fast lookups.  If I were going to implement this myself with no tools or libraries, I was thinking of implementing a btree where the nodes are the utf8 byte value of the string.  The depth would correspond to the position in the string.  At some point, though, the tree would need to be persisted on disk because the whole thing wont fit into memory.  I can imagine many optimizations to this that I wont have time to write.  Before I get started, I was wondering if theres already any tools out there like this  Perhaps lucene might do the trick, but Im not sure since I need exact matching not fuzzy.  Any ideas  Thanks.p

Negative 35343 pWe write apps for contract  we have many apps out there, and they all use our library. But we have no control over when they are released, that is up to the clients, so they all have different versions of our library which is always being added to.p  pI would like to know what the proper way to avoid using the same package name for the library in each project is I trust this makes sense to the more seasoned BB devs here.p  pFor my distribution builds, I refactor the library to use a unique package name for that project usually by putting the clients name into the package structure. But this adds time, trouble, and messes with eclipses svn clients. It seems totally wrong to do it this way but it works.p  pThere must be a proper way to do this, some tool or script even, since being forced to go down this path each time seems wrong. What is the right way to avoid this problem.p  hr  pExplanation of Why this is a problemp  ul liIf you install many apps using the same package structure somewhere in them, then the device overwrites the packages. e.g. If I use codecom.ric.sdkcode as my library, then each app that uses my sdk will overwrite whatever version is there. li ul  pThis is great if we only every upgrade. For us, some issues collide simultaneously, making a problem for usp  ol liWe write apps for many different clients, and like to use our common code for each client.li liWe are a new company, and our sdk is growing. Each app normally adds a few methods to some class or other. So each new app needs the newest sdk. The old apps will still work with the new sdk. The new apps will break with the old sdk.li liWe do not have release control, so cannot be sure that all apps out there always have the latest sdk.li ol  pe.g. we have a radio streaming app which was created 8 months ago. And a video streaming app unrelated client from 3 months ago. A vehicle tracking app for this month. If someone installs the tracking app, and then after finds amp installs the radio app, the new sdk is overwritten by an old one, and the tracking app breaks because it is not compatible with the old sdk.p  pthis question deals with the same issues a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5007763doappsdownloadedfromappworldshareprojectsDo apps downloaded from App World share projectsap  pWe have learnt the lesson and now refactor the sdk before the final build of each app, to a unique name e.g. coderadio.ric.sdkcode or codevideo.ric.sdkcode.p  pBut this is a horrible process, messes with the svn, wastes time, allows for human error etc  is there a tool that does this for me I do not believe that we are doing it the right way.p

Negative 35343 pSo I have made a website built for vertical orientation on the iPhone with the MobileBoilerplate framework.  Its 320px wide and looks great in vertical orientation.p  pBut, when you turn the iPhone sideways, now there are about 100px of white space on the righthand side.  Id like to have the viewport zoom in so the 320px design fills up the whole space.  p  pAny suggestions  Thanks so muchp  pBradp

Negative 35343 pI am currently having a problem with adding collision detection through an external class to one of my MovieClips with the class name of Level2Walls.

Negative 35343 pI know, variations of this question had been asked before. But my case may be a little different p  pSo, I am building a site that tracks events. Each event has id and value. It is also performed by a user, which has id, age, gender, city, country and rank. these attributes are all integers, if it mattersp  pI need to be able to quickly get answers to two queriesp  ul liget number of events from users with certain profile for example, males with age 1825 from Moscow, Russiali liget summaybe avg also of values of events from users with certain profile  li ul  pAlso, data is generated by multiple customers, which, in turn, can have multiple sourceids. p  pAccess pattern data  will be mostly written by collector processes, but when queried infrequently, by web ui it has to respond quickly.p  pI expect LOTS of data, certainly more than one table or single server can handle.p  pI am thinking about grouping events in separate tables per day that is, events20111011. Also I want to prefix table name with customer id and source id, so that data is isolated and can be trivially discarded purge old data and relatively easily moved around distribute load to other machines.  This way, every such table will have limited amount of rows, lets say, 10M tops.p  pSo, the question is what to do with users attributesp  pOption 1, normalized store them in separate table and reference from event tables. p  ul lipro No repetition of data. li licon joins, which are expensive or so I heard.  li licon this requires user table and event tables to be on the same serverli ul  pOption 2, redundant store user attributes in event tables and index them.p  ul lipro easier load balancing selfcontained tables can be moved around li lipro simpler faster queriesli licon lots of disk space and memory used for repeating user attributes and corresponding indexes li ul
Negative 35343 pIs there any way to unReset the Toolbox in Visual Studio 2008p  pI was trying to get my firstever WPF UserControl to appear in the Toolbox. I rebuilt my project, then rightclicked on the Toolbox and chose Reset Toolbox from the popup menu hoping that would refresh the control list I know better now. Alas, the reset removed ALL the controls from the Toolbox for WPF projects Its still OK for WinForms projects.p  pSo is there a relatively quick way to restore all the standard WPF controls to the Toolbox... I only had the standard controls being a WPF noob so No I didnt take a backup before I hit the reset switch... BIG Sighp  pThanking you all in advance,p  pKeith.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrong To document my sort of resolution to the problem...p  pI got my WPF controls back, but theyre not in there nice seperate toolboxes i.e. the expandable sections, or whatever you call them. Meh Itll have to do p  pTo get them back... With a WPF Window open Window1.xaml for example rightclick on the General toolbox, select Choose items ... from the popup menu, goto the WPF Components tab, select ALL items and click the checkbox of the last item to make all tools visible, then click the OK button... then if you want rightclick on the toolbox and select Sort Items Alphabetically then go back into rightclickToolbox  Choose Items  WPF Components and untick all those items which dont have distinctive icon emthe default icon is a white window with a blue border containing a cone which appears to be blowing red bubbles... stoners bewareem. Youll probably have to OK your unticks halfway down the list, coz you cant scroll the toolbox too see the icons whilst the Choose Items dialogue is open.p  pCheers all. Hope this helps the next MS Victim.p  pKeith.p  pPS For what its worth, I still think this is a bug in VS2008... Resetting the toolbars should retore them to there original condition. Which, as far as Im concerned, includes the out of the box WPF toolbox configuration. I presume its lost them coz the WPF Toolboxs whereare a tack on... implemented as custom toolboxs the same as a userdefined toolbox. Sigh.p  pIf its still a bug in VS2010 then maybe it should be reported, so that atleast it probably wont be propagated to 2012, or whatever comes next.p
Negative 35343 pI have an array which will fetch rows from the database. But what I want to do is to create a new empty row in the table where if coderow[StudentAnswer]code equals coderow[AnswerContent]code then new field lets say its called coderow[StudentAnswerWeight]code  coderow[Weight]code else coderow[StudentAnswerWeight]code  0.p  pOK the table is an output from a query. The array contains fields from the query. Look at this for an example row[Answercontent]  Leeds This is the correct answer for the question. row[StudentAnswer]  Leeds This is what the student has put for the answer. The row[weight] is the percentage of the mark for the correct answer. Lets say that the answer for the above example  5 of the total marks. Now as the above example shows that the students answer has matched the correct answer it means that in the new field I want row[StudentAnswerWeight] to display the wieght percentage of the answer which is 5. If the studnet got the answer wrong by lets say the Student put in hisher answer Manchester. The studentanswerweight should  0 as that the answer is wrong.

Negative 35343 pMaybe the question title is a little confusing, so Ill try to clarify things In a report I receive a dataset with a datatable which contain records to be shown. I cannot change that its not under my control.p  pThe records have a field, RetirementDate, which can be filled or null. Based on this, the records must be shown on two distinct tables on the same report. p  pBoth reports have the same grouping two groups, on Department an Category, and Category is included inside department.p  pSo reports should looks like thisp  precodeTable 1  Non retired RetirementDate is null   Department 1     Categ 1       Details ....     ....     Categ n       Details ....    Department 2     Categ 1       Details ....     ....     Categ n       Details ....  Table 2  Retired RetirementDate is not null   Department 1     Categ 1       Details ....     ....     Categ n       Details ....    Department 2     Categ 1       Details ....     ....     Categ n       Details .... codepre  pWhat I was tried was to set Filter for table 1 TrimRetiredDateamp and for table 2 TrimRetiredDateampp  pBut that didnt worked. Table 1 wasnt even shown even if 90 of records have RetiredDatenull, it just show grand total band, and most records were shown in table 2.  Obvious I missunderstand how Filter on table worksp  pI managed to temporary sort of workaround by setting condition above on Hidden prop on  details band of each table, and it kinda worked except it shows me Department Header  categ header for all dept  categs combinations, no matter they have or no details records  which, obvious, is not good.p  pCan anyone tell how can I accomplish what I needed I thought Filter on table should work, but obvious it didnt the way I thought of.p  pIm using SSRS 2005, and actually the report is used in offline mode, where the dataset is pushed in report before opening by client app and report is loaded in webbased viewer. Thats why I cannot change what data I get.p  pThank you  p

Negative 35343 pIve read the transitioning to ARC notes and I still have a bit of confusion about properties attributes we shoulcan use... We can use weak in place of assign with the advantage that the property is set to nil if the object it points to is released, strong in place of retain and what in place of copy We still use copy alone or do we need to couple strong with copy, such as codeproperty strong,copycode.. Maybe I need to practice and read again the doc because ARC is not very clear to me...p

Negative 35343 pIts currently impossible for a user to tell if clicking on something will load something in their current page or take them to a new page.

Negative 35343 pI have a simple test application where I want to have a clear button that clears the text area.  I want the clear button to be disabled when the text area is empty.

I bound this property to the enabled property of the clear button and things work great... but wait  When textEmpty is true, enabled is set to true... I want the reverse.  Im not interested in this test application functioning correctly... its just an example.  Im interested in negating the binding property expression in Netbeans.  Currently the expression looks likep  precodeForm[textEmpty] codepre  pHow do I negate itp  pPlease understand that Im interested in negating the expression.  I know I can just change the property from textEmpty to something like textNotEmpty and update the logic.  Thats not what Im interested.  I imagine this problem will come up frequently when I use javabeans that I do not have control over the properties, so I want to understand these binding expressions better.p

I am getting users information using their FaceBook authentication through FBConnect. p  pTo update fanwall screen efficiently, I want to have a local SQLite database for my App that contains userId, his profile image, his comments for my App etc. I have all these info in my SQL server database but not sure how to synchronize this info with iPhones SQLite database.p  pMy problemsp  pI am using ASIHTTPRequest to query my SQL database and it can return whole table as Array of C .NET class.

Negative 35343 pWe are about to start a new project and our company wants to go with the agile approach of where the business analyst writes user stories and from that we should be able to do BDD to flesh out our code.p  pHowever, the business analyst has been very vague and has given user stories which cover half of what certain pieces of functionality must do. p  pSince there are so many areas that are a bit grey, should a developer sit with him and make sure that all areas are coveredp  pI suppose from an agile point of view, the business analyst cannot cover all the user stories but what I am afraid of is we will start developing code and not all the user stories are covered until the end. Also, we could have several developers all becoming experts in certain areas of functionality with the business analyst and no overall designeranalyst to bring these areas together to make sure they will all work.p  pAnother approach would be to get someone who has the role of the architect and via DDD fleshes out the overall design. But this would still involve having all the user stories.p  pSo what is the best approachp

Negative 35343 pI am using Vim and GVim on a Win32 platform alas, Windows is against my nature, but its a work machine. I have noticed in GVim that when it returns to focus either using the mouse, or via ALTTAB there is a brief lag of 23 seconds before the cursor resumes flashing and it becomes usable. I definitely do not experience this in when running Vim from the console. I have not it experienced on Linux boxes either, but then I do not edit such long files on my home machine.p  pPreviously I also experienced the slow behaviour when switching between splits within a GVim session using codeltcwgtltcwgtcode.

I was able to avoid that by settingp  precodeset eventignoreBufEnter,WinEnter,BufWinEnter codepre  pBut I still have the problems when the GVim window itself regains focus. Adding codeset eventignoreFocusGainedcode makes no difference. Is there any way to persuade GVim to return to focus more smoothlyp  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 35343 pBy persistent collections I mean collections like those in clojure.p  pFor example, I have a list with the elements a,b,c. With a normal list, if I add d, my original list will have a,b,c,d as its elements. With a persistent list, when I call list.addd, I get back a new list, holding a,b,c,d. However, the implementation attempts to share elements between the list wherever possible, so its much more memory efficient than simply returning a copy of the original list. It also has the advantage of being immutable if I hold a reference to the original list, then it will always return the original 3 elements.p  pThis is all explained much better elsewhere e.g. a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPersistentdatastructurehttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPersistentdatastructurea.p  pAnyway, my question is... whats the best library for providing this functionality for use in java  Can I use the clojure collections somehow other that by directly using clojurep

Thanks.p  pAlso, ignore the ArrayToDBString methods, those are definitely not the issues since, like I said, Ive printed the last query and ran it through SQL successfully. Also, the result I get when running it through SQL is a single column called ContactID.p

Negative 35343 pI have a UITextField in a custom section header. There are multiple sections using this style of header, and therefore multiple UITextFields.p  pI have implemented the UITextFieldDelegate.

How do I determine which section header this UITextField was in I need to save the value to core data in the appropriate NSManagedObject for that section.p  pMany thanks in advancep  pEDIT Several people have suggested using a tag of the section number when creating the cell, which would work perfectly. However, I have already assigned the UITextField a tag to distinguish it as a header textfield as opposed to a cell textfield or a footer textfield. There are a whole lotta textfields on this tablep  pFurther EDIT Using in indexPath has been suggested. This would be my preferred solution if I can get it to work. Does anyone know if headers and footers have indexPathsp

Negative 35343 pI have been in the process of upgrading a Spring MVC app that was using Framework 2.5.6, Security 2.0.4, and Web Services 1.5. In researching the newer versions, Ive realized that Spring 3.1.0 and 3.0.7 deprecate the inheritance for controllers in favor of annotation driven configuration. I understand that annotations are the way forward with Spring configuration but in my situation the people who will be configuring default values for dependency injection cannot edit src files.p  pThe process at my company is like thisp  ul liI am the main developer for the Java EE app. li liWe have another team of designers and lessskilled developers who customize jsp, css, some javascript, xsl, the XML Spring configuration, and the Spring properties files. li liWe have over 100 active custom implementations, each with different default values to be injected into beans and some with i18n messaging.li liInstead of having 100s of different themes in our core product, we have a very smart build process that allows our customization team to maintain the custom applications within their own source control system. The build script will overwrite any files from the custom application to the core application before compiling and deploying to Tomcat. Therefore, src files are never touched, decoupling the engineering from the aesthetics within our company.li ul  pIf I had a chance to build a configuration module into the app, it would have already been done. So for now were stuck with managing XML configurations.p  pSo how would an annotation configuration work in my case It seems to me like it is not a feasible solution given the architecture of our product. Isnt the main goal of annotationdriven configuration to have the developer manage dependency injection within src files instead of XML filesp  pDoes anyone know a way to have only XML configuration in Spring 3 p  pEDIT I found this a hrefhttpstatic.springsource.orgspringdocs3.0.xspringframeworkreferencehtmlbeans.htmlbeansjavacombining relnofollowhttpstatic.springsource.orgspringdocs3.0.xspringframeworkreferencehtmlbeans.htmlbeansjavacombininga so I think I can migrate all the controllers to use annotations but leave other beans as they are since controller configurations are not touched very often by our customization team.p
Negative 35343 pI have a page which contains several tables, and I would like to format each table so that the second cell of each other row has a specific background color.

Negative 35343 pWe are currently facing the following problem We have an application that needs to display a multitude of separate OpenSceneGraph scenes in different Qt widgets. For example, we might have one Qt widget depicting a sphere, while another widget depicts an icosahedron. Since we are using OpenSceneGraph 3.0.1, we followed the a hrefhttpwww.openscenegraph.orgsvnosgOpenSceneGraphtagsOpenSceneGraph3.0.1examplesosgviewerQtosgviewerQt.cpp relnofollowosgViewerQt example from the official documentationa for implementing this.p  pThe example code uses a codeQTimercode in order to force updates for the viewer widgetp  precode    connect amptimer, SIGNALtimeout, this, SLOTupdate      timer.start 10  codepre  pThe problems now begin when we want to create and show emmultipleem widgets. Since each widget comes with its own timer, performance strongrapidly decreasesstrong with the number of open widgets. Not only is the interaction with the OSG widgets very slow, also the interaction with emotherem Qt widgets noticeably lags. Even a halfway recent quadcore system is almost overwhelmed when approximately 5 windows are open. This issue is strongdefinitelystrong not related to our graphics hardware. Other applications may render much larger scenes Blender, Meshlab etc. emwithoutem any negative performance impact.p  pSo, to summarize What would be the best way of creating multiple Qt widgets showing different OpenSceneGraph scenes emwithoutem a performance impact p  pWhat we already triedp  ul liWe already considered using a single codeosgViewerCompositeViewercode for rendering emallem scene objects. However, we discarded this idea for now because it will probably make interactions with a single widget very complicated.li liWe tried putting the rendering portion of each codeosgViewerCompositeViewercode in a separate thread as detailed by the a hrefhttpwww.openscenegraph.orgsvnosgOpenSceneGraphtagsOpenSceneGraph3.0.1examplesosgQtWidgetsosgQtWidgets.cpp relnofollowosgQtWidgets examplea.li ul  pOur second try using threads looked roughly like thisp  precode   class ViewerFrameThread  public OpenThreadsThread              public             ViewerFrameThreadosgViewerViewerBase viewerBase                 viewerBaseviewerBase               ViewerFrameThread                              cancel                 whileisRunning                                      OpenThreadsThreadYieldCurrentThread                                            int cancel                              viewerBasegtsetDonetrue                 return 0                           void run                              int result  viewerBasegtrun                           osgrefptrltosgViewerViewerBasegt viewerBase      codepre  pHowever, this emalsoem resulted in a remarkable performance decrease. Each thread still requires much CPU time which is not surprising as the basic interaction is emstillem handled with a timer. The only advantage of this approach is that at least interaction with emotherem Qt widgets remain possible.p  pThe ideal solution for us would be a widget that only fires redraw requests whenever the user interacts with it, for example by emclickingem, emdoubleclickingem, emscrollingem etc. More precisely, this widget should remain emidleem until there is a need for an update. Is something akin to this possible emat allem We would welcome any suggestions.p

It must NOT include the goals from the current match.  p  pThe difference with yesterdays question was that it only counted previous matches where the home team played at home and the away team played away. With this question, it doesnt matter if the home team previously played at home or away.

Negative 35343 pIm currently working on a project where our product at the current version is deployed at more than one client site. More often that not we test and scrap a.k.a. refactor  the DB design in our devtest environment.

Negative 35343 pSo, Im making a HTML5 RPG just for fun. The map is a codeltcanvasgtcode 512px width, 352px height  16 tiles across, 11 tiles top to bottom. I want to know if theres a more efficient way to paint the codeltcanvasgtcode.p  pHeres how I have it right nowp  h2How tiles are loaded and painted on maph2  pThe map is being painted by tiles 32x32 using the codeImagecode piece. The image files are loaded through a simple codeforcode loop and put into an array called codetiles[]code to be PAINTED on using codedrawImagecode.p  pFirst, we load the tiles...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commm7Zc.png altenter image description herep  pand heres how its being donep  precode SET UP THE amp DRAW THE MAP TILES tiles  [] var loadedImagesCount  0 for x  0 x lt NUMOFTILES x    var imageObj  new Image  new instance for each image   imageObj.src  jstilest  x  .png   imageObj.onload  function       console.logAdded tile ...   loadedImagesCount     loadedImagesCount     if loadedImagesCount  NUMOFTILES         Onces all tiles are loaded ...

But for here, it an allgrass map. p  pRight now, the maps use 2D arrays.

Once the 2d array above is codereturncode, the corresponding number in each array will be painted according to codeImagecode stored inside codetile[]code. Then codedrawImagecode will occur and paint according to the codexcode and codeycode and times it by code32code to paint on the correct codexycode coordinate.p  h2How multiple map switching occursh2  pWith my game, maps have five things to keep track of codecurrentIDcode, codeleftIDcode, coderightIDcode, codeupIDcode, and codebottomIDcode.p  ul listrongcurrentIDstrong The current ID of the map you are on. li listrongleftIDstrong What ID of codecurrentIDcode to load when you exit on the left of current map.li listrongrightIDstrong What ID of codecurrentIDcode to load when you exit on the right of current map. li listrongdownIDstrong What ID of codecurrentIDcode to load when you exit on the bottom of current map. li listrongupIDstrong What ID of codecurrentIDcode to load when you exit on the top of current map.li ul  pSomething to note If either codeleftIDcode, coderightIDcode, codeupIDcode, or codebottomIDcode are NOT specific, that means they are a code0code. That means they cannot leave that side of the map. It is merely an invisible blockade.p  pSo, once a person exits a side of the map, depending on where they exited... for example if they exited on the bottom, codebottomIDcode will the number of the codemapcode to load and thus be painted on the map.p  pHeres a representational .GIF to help you better visualizep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comASvZV.gif altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, sooner or later, with many maps I will be dealing with emmanyem IDs. And that can possibly get a little confusing and hectic. p  pThe obvious pros is that it load 176 tiles at a time, refresh a small 512x352 canvas, and handles one map at time. The con is that the MAP ids, when dealing with many maps, may get confusing at times.p  h2My questionh2  ul liIs this an efficient way to store maps given the usage of tiles, or is there a better way to handle mapsli ul  pI was thinking along the lines of a giant map.

Im planning to use Apples Enteprise approach to distribute our private commercial app to each of our iPhones clients.p  pThe server can push configuration settings to each client.

The clients can request more data sets from the server.  These exchanges can be managed asynchronously.  p  pThere is also be a need to have synchronous exchanges for critical processes.  This is rare, but it is a requirement.p  pThe data that needs to be exchanged is reasonably small. These clientserver processes are time dependent, so performance is critical requirement.p  pThe network wont be shared, but needs to be tightly controlled and fast.  E.g. it can be Bonjour if there is a compelling reason for that.p  pIm looking for a recommendation on which components of the MaciOS SDKs to leverage.

All good.p  pId like to implement a Clear button that clears the selection of controller1, which, thanks to bindings, should also clear the selection of controller2 and reset view1 and view2 to the null placeholder. For the life of me, I cant figure out the proper code for this very simple function. Altering the selection of controller1 fails to update the value shown in view1. Worse, altering the controller1 selection programatically causes weird things to happen in controller2 further selection of values in view1 fails to have any effect on view2.p  pThings Ive triedp  ul lipCalling the SetSelectedObjects method of controller1 with an [NSArray new].pli lipCalling the SetSelectedObjects method of controller1 with null.pli lipCalling the SetSelectedIndex method of controller1 with NSNotFound.pli lipCalling the RemoveSelectedIndex method of controller1 with the SelectedIndex property of controller1.pli lipLooking in the Cocoa NSArrayController documentation for any class method or suggestion for clearing the selection value.

Negative 35343 pIm not sure if fade out is the correct term to use, as it seems to refer to the animation effect a lot, but what Id like to achieve can be seen in the address bar of the iPhone Safari app.  When a URL is too long to display, the end of the string faded out rather than truncated with ....p  pI thought this could be easily done by changing the Line Breaks setting from Truncate Tail to Clip in the XIB file and then using an image with transparency to create the effect.  But  setting to Clip seems to clip at the end of a word, rather than the middle of a word, or the middle of a letter even, as seen in Safari or Chrome for iPhone.  This doesnt quite work for me, and it actually gives the impression that the text is complete, when upon closer inspection, the user will notice that the text doesnt make sense.p  pWhats the best way to fade out strings that dont fit in text labels  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 35343 pFirst, I am going to give a summary of what I need  to achieve. I have an acquisition system that receives at least two different types of data over time that I have to incorporate on a state estimation framework. There are two main scenarios regarding the data receptionp  ol liType strongAstrong Some data can be incorporated directly as it arrives 10 Hz, a FIFO queue would be enough for this.li liType strongBstrong Unfortunately, some of the data requires more processing 1 second so that it is incorporated to the estimation framework with a delay. In this case I have to strong1strong recover the past state of the framework at the reception of the type strongBstrong before processing then strong2strong use the type strongBstrong data to recompute the state at that time, and then strong3strong go forward in time incorporating all the type strongAstrong data received in the meantime the data is incorporated respecting the time ordering.li ol  pFrom the C programming point of view, I am thinking on the following solutionp  ul liDefine a general codetimeSamplecode class. So that every kind of data will be encapsulated in classes that inherit from the codetimeSamplecode mother class. Thus I will have something like codetimeSampleAcode and codetimeSampleBcode that can be dynamically cast from a codetimeSamplecode pointer. This is useful when the samples are passed back to the estimation framework, because it can now the kind of sample it is and call the appropriate function.li liFor each timeSample child class there is a circular buffer. So codetimeSampleAcode data is stored in codecircularBufferlttimeSampleAgtcode, codetimeSampleBcode data is stored in codecircularBufferlttimeSampleBgtcode and so on.li liA codemultisetlttimeSamplegtcode is used to store the time ordered pointers of the samples some of the pointers point to data inside codecircularBufferlttimeSampleAgtcode, and other to data inside the codecircularBufferlttimeSampleBgtcode. The codetimeSamplecode pointers are ordered using the time field inside the codetimeSamplecode instance that stores the time instant where the sample was received.li liAll the containers would be included in the same class, to ensure that the data is managed correctly. For example, when a type strongBstrong sample has finished the processing and the estimation is updated the cutoff time that defines which samples can be erased increases. This operation requires to correctly erase data from the codemultisetcode and from the codecircularBuffercodes. li ul  pI would like to knowp  ul liErrors and suggestions of the current solution I have proposed. li liSuggestions of circular buffer template implementations. I am currently learning how to use the boost library circular buffer   a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1490libscircularbufferdoccircularbuffer.html relnofollowhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1490libscircularbufferdoccircularbuffer.htmlali liExperience on similar problems would help a lot, specially on usage of circular buffers.li ul  pYour advice is welcomep

Negative 35343 pI was given an assignment to code an algorithm outputting in a plain ASCII, no fancy drawings, for a given K, a KxK square with the lines of symmetry as x and other things as o. If K is even, though, we use two lines of xes to mark the horizontal and vertical line of symmetry. Moreover, we cant use more than two loops in the whole source.p  pSo I have two ideas. The first is to analyze the coordinates each of the points should fulfill  there should be an equation for each of the points telling us if a given Kx, Ky point is x or o. We put it in the alternation of some if and just whileloop through all possible Kx, Ky marking some spots as x and others as y. This requires one loop.p  pThe other idea, quite bruteforce but not making us analyze all the points, is to have a set of variables we then use for concatenating the strings. Let me explain we have one while loop checking the height variable each turn we decrement it by one inside which we use a custom method of some repeatString consisting of one whileloop as well it just multiplies the string by given t times. So we have something like thisp  precodewhileheight if heightmaxHeight OR 0 print repeatStringx, maxWidth else if height is an element of markedKy an array telling us which Kys to mark as xes as the whole print repearStringx, maxWidth else print xhowManySpaces x [xx if even]  howManySpaces  x codepre  p...and so on. What I write above is of course very loose and does not cover many cases in fact , it does quite a little, but I think it may make my concept less confusing. This second method, however, would be a real pain to code  I can see just now how bugprone it is.p  pIs there any third, best method Im cracking my head on this, though it seems so easy, and cant figure out anything else.p

Negative 35343 h2Backgroundh2  pIm just doing an exercise following a course pyt201 at FXPHD if anyone was curious and one of the things were building up is a SequentialRange class thats meant to represent frames of footage. For simplicity assume integer frame numbers and no weird subframe renders.p  pOne method im implementing is codeaddframesself, framescode which accepts an unspecified lot of iterables and adds them in. The demo code simply does thisp  precodefor frame in imapint, chainframes         self.addframe codepre  h2Id like to..h2  p...avoid this behaviour since if you pass in a malformed sequence say, trivially, [1,2,fish,6,7] your resulting SequentialRange will be in one of those ugly halfprocessed states which helps nobody. Since its a set I know you could just patch the input, and readd it and dupes will be thrown out but Id like to write it up so that the addframes operation is more binary and either successfully loads all the frames, OR doesnt pollute the existing set.p  pThe thought process was that basically, Ill have an codeaddframecode method which Ill do any mystical voodoo necessary right now its just codeself.addinttheinputframevaluecode which in a way provides me my sanity check on the input. So I can create a temporary set from the input, and if thats successful, do a union of the temp set and the original set. The problem Im finding is that union returns me a copy made up of the union of the two sets, so I have to resort to something likep  precodetemporaryset  SequentialRange try     for frame in itertools.chainframes         temporaryset.addframeframe except ValueError      placeholder flameout message     printmalformed input, no changes made     return except     raise  for x in temporaryset     self.addframex codepre  h2It works but...h2  p...Im unconvinced that reiterating through the set is a good idea. It feels, err.. wrong Mainly I think because Ive gone and iterated through my input once for sanity checking, I dont like having to reiterate for an add phase. p  pSo yes, any suggestions on what Im doing wrong I cant shake the feeling that theres something Im missing that would make this easier, but at the same time, since this is for the sheer learning heck of it, alt approaches to the problem also welcomed..p

Im reading an operating systems book which describes how a semaphore is implemented. In their implementation the semaphore struct maintains a linked list of processes currently waiting for the semaphore.

Correct The threads in the linked list are put into a codeTASKINTERRUPTIBLEcode state until the semaphore is available, at which point one process is woken up by setting its state to codeTASKRUNNINGcode.p

Its an audit trail that logs any and all changes in our software. Is it not smart to do this Would I be better off storing this in another data store redis or another database Or does Postgresql handle this in a way that a large table wont effect read performance on other tables. How does postgres know which data to cache in memory etc.p  pSorry for such a basic and vague question, Im not sure how else to ask this. I just dont want to get down the road, a year from now, and were having serious database performance issues because one of our tables is 50gb, while the rest of the database is lt 1gb.p  pThanks.p

Negative 35343 pIm building a simple little movie cataloging database system for my own use.  The problem right now is that Ive got a mySQL query that works MOST of the time but not all.  Basically it works by using a 3rd party IMDB API.  I use that to search and pull the values I need which works just fine.  It displays on my preview screen and everything.  The problem Im running into that that while most movies work, a few do not and I cant figure out the reason.p  pFor example, The Fellowship of the Ring stores just fine while The Return of the King simply wont pass the query.

Negative 35343 pIf I run CtrlP natively out of the box, it works 100 as I desire, except that with the size of the codebase I work with, it takes a very long time to index directories.p  pTo make CtrlP cope with the project sizes Im dealing with, Im using the following fairly popular usercommand setting in my .vimrc file to provide native helperutilities to more quickly provide CtrlP with the list of files availablep  precodeif hasunix     let gctrlpusercommand        types           1 [.git, cd s ampamp git lsfiles]      ,      fallback find s type f  head  . gctrlpmaxfiles       endif codepre  pThis approach makes indexing blazingly fast, but when configured this way CtrlP doesnt learn about the contents of git submodules the way that it did when running without helper programs since git lsfiles doesnt recurse into submodules, while CtrlPs naive directory traversal does.p  pIve tried using find to index git repositories as well, but when I do that I wind up indexing .git directories, object files, and all sorts of other things that CtrlP normally knows to ignore automatically  seems like providing a usercommand completely supersedes the builtin logic about which files to ignore.  I could probably hack together an inverse grep to remove certain elements, but it seemed like someone must have figured out a more elegant solution to this.p  pIs there another, perhaps cleverer way to get CtrlP to index all files within a git repository, including the files inside all its submodules, other than resorting to its slow builtin searchp

Negative 35343 pIn Ruby on Rails we have Gems, that you can reuse to be part of your software. p  pWe have the same in Django, they call it apps. There are modules in Drupal too.p  pFor example, lets say that you are developing web software to control a proccess in your office, and you would like to add a poll, so users may interact.p  pIn Rails we may have a gem to do that, same in django apps and modules in drupal.p  pSo these gemappmodules have all the code to include in your web software, considering controllers, views and models.p  pBut if we think of Java EE 6 we have plenty of jars and specifications that help to make software. But Java EE doesnt have these kind of gemappmodules to include in your software.p  pJust to be clear, the question is not about using a framework or not.p  pLet me say that Ive got an app with Java EE 6 p  ul liEJB 3.1, JPA 2,  js2  primeli liand some jars, like prettyfaces and integrations.li ul  pNow I need to develop a forum or a poll functionality, so I have to write all code ejbjpajsf to make that forum. If I were using Rails, I could install a pollforum gem, or in Django an app that make this forum and so on.p  pI have some experience in these other frameworks, ROR, Django and Drupal its true that it is a CMS, but it has plenty of modules so maybe its a framework anyway,  And these modules are part of the software, written using all layers. In Java EE it should have EJB 3.1 code, JPA2 code and js2 code.p  pSo, we can make an analogy with Plone and Zope. Let say that Zope is Java EE 6 and Plone is what Im looking for in Java EE.p  pSo my question is Does there exists a repository where you can find these kind of modules for Java EEp  pIf this really doesnt exist, is it possible to create gemappmodules like these in a Java EE architecturep

Negative 35343 pIm having a bit of trouble with some vba script im attempting to run from a button on a form.p  pVia a linked MDB file, Ive written a string of Make Table queries that help certain other queries work. Rather than have the user rerun each individual Make Table query onebyone, Ive put the queries in a VBA script using strongDoCmd.RunSQLstrong and then assigned that script to a button on a form.p  pThe data source im using also has a File Info table that contains the File Name and the File Date of the data.p  pWhen the user clicks the button, Id like them to know what data source was used when the string of Make Tables queries was run that way they know what data the script was run on.p  pMy approach to this was to create a final Make Table query using the File Info table to put the File Name and File Date in its own table. p  pI would then add these fields to the form and add the strongDoCmd.RunSQLstrong for this final Make Table query in to the bottom of the VBA script for the button once all the Make Tables had run, the File Info and File Date fields would then be displayedupdated on the form telling the user what data file had been used the last time the script was run. p  pHeres the code for this for brevity Ive summarised all the Make Table scripts that run prior to the FileInfo as some bogus AllOtherMakeTables stringp  precodePrivate Sub Command0Click  On Error GoTo ErrCommand0Click  DoCmd.SetWarnings False  Dim AllOtherMakeTables As String Dim FileInfoStamp As String  AllOtherMakeTables   SELECT SomeField INTO AnotherTable  amp  FROM SomeTable   FileInfoStamp   SELECT FileInfo.FileName, FileInfo.FileDate INTO FileInfoStamp  amp  FROM FileInfo   DoCmd.RunSQL AllOtherMakeTables DoCmd.RunSQL FileInfoStamp  DoCmd.SetWarnings True  ExitCommand0Click Exit Sub  ErrCommand0Click     MsgBox Err.Description     Resume ExitCommand0Click  End Sub codepre  pClicking the button using the script above yields the following error messagep  blockquote   pThe database engine could not lock table FileInfoStamp because it is   already in use by another person or processp blockquote  pI think what is happening is the fields I added to the form FileName and FileDate are locking the FileInfoStamp table when the form is open, so when the script tries to recreate the FileInfoStamp it is unable to do this as the table is locked.p  pI thought this might be fixed simply by adding a strongDoCmd.Closestrong at the start of the above script and then adding a strongDoCmd.OpenFormstrong at the end of the script essentially closing the form whilst the Make Table commands are run and then reopening the form at the end. p  pAll this does though is close the form and bring up the same error message. So I guess even though the form is closed the connections with the fields on the form still remain active in some way...p  pAny assistance on how I might get around this would be much appreciated.

Fortunately before I commit the new changes I saw binbuildupload was modified and this led me to found I switched branch.p  pThe question is. Is there a way to prevent this ambiguity How can I tell git when I do checkout if I want to switch branch or revert a file p

However, I am a bit stuck there... Is it even possiblep  pAny thoughts are welcome of course.p  pstrongSome extra thoughsstrongp  pI could use several threads to speed up the calculation on finding Perfect numbers. However, I have no experience yet with good partitioning.  Ill try to explain my thoughts no code yetp  pFirst Ill be generating a primetable with use of the sieve of Erathostenes. It takes about 25 ms to find primes within the range of 2  1 million single threaded.p  pWhat C offers is quite astonishing. Using PLINQ with the Parallel.For method, I could run several calculations almost simultaneously, however, it chunks the primeTable array into parts which are not respected to the search. p  pI already figured out that the automatic load balancing of the threads is not sufficient for this task. Hence I need to try a different approach by dividing the loadbalance depending on the mersenne numbers to find and use to calculate a perfect number. Has anyone some experience with this This page seems to be a bit helpful a hrefhttpwww.drdobbs.comwindowscustomparallelpartitioningwithnet4224600406 relnofollowhttpwww.drdobbs.comwindowscustomparallelpartitioningwithnet4224600406a p  pIll be looking into it further.p  pAs for now, my results are as following. My current algorithm using the standard BigInteger class from C can find the first 17 perfect numbers see a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiListofperfectnumbers relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiListofperfectnumbersa within 5 seconds on my laptop an Intel I5 with 4 cores and 8GB of RAM. However, then it gets stuck and finds nothing within 10 minutes.p  pThis is something I cannot match yet... My gut feeling and common sense tells me that I should look into the LucasLehmer test, since a forloop calculating the 18th perfect number using Mersenne Prime 3217 would run 3214 times. There is room for improvement I guess...p  pWhat Dinony posted below is a suggestion to rewrite it completely in C. I agree that would boost my performance, however I choose C to find out its limitations and benefits.

As I understand things, coderebasecode is good because it maintains linearity, but can be confusing for collaborators because it alters history.p  pSo, would it be fair to deduce thatp  ol lipOn the feature branch, use fetchmerge to maintain history and avoid confusion amongst collaborators. The clutter doesnt matter since itll be deleted after pushing to master anyway.pli lipOn the master branch, use rebase to avoid clutter. Modifying history doesnt matter because the feature branch gets pushed out as a single commit.pli ol

Negative 35343 pWe have a system running Windows Server 2008R2 x64 and SQL Server 2008R2 x64 with SSRS installedconfigured.  This is a shared reporting server used by a large number of people, with some fairly large inefficient databases 400500gb of data ish, and these users use the system to generate adhoc reports based of a reporting model that sits on top of the aforementioned databases.  Note that the users are using NTLM to logon and identify for running reports.p  pMost reports are quick, but if you are running a report for 1 or 2 years worth of data, they can take a while to return 5minutes ish.  This is fine for most users, however some of the users are stuck behind a proxy, which has a connection timeout set at 2minutes.  As SSRS 2008R2 does not seem to send back a keepalive signal confirmed via wireshark, when running one of these long reports the proxy server thinks the connection has died, and as such it just gives up and kills the connection.  This gives the user a 401 or 503 error and obviously cancels the report the incorrect error is a known bug in SSRS which Microsoft refuse to fix.p  pWere getting a lot of flak from the users about this, even though its not really our issue..so I am looking for a creative solution.p  pSo far I have come up withp  p1 Discovering some as yet unknown setting for SSRS that can make it keep the connection alive.br  2 installing our own proxy in between the users and our reports server, which WILL send a keepalive back not sure this will work and its a bit hacky, just thinking creativelybr  3 rewriting our reports databases to be more efficient yes this is the best solution, but also incredibly expensivebr  4 ask the experts  br p  pWe have a call booked in with Microsoft Support to see if they can help  but can any experts on Stack help out I appreciate that this may be a better question for server fault and I may post it there but its a development question too really p  pThanksp

Maybe I have some settings changed in my project Im not sure why I have the same setup in both projects, but only one is working.p

Negative 35343 pIm new to Bluetooth device development. My current project needs a function of using Bluetooth headset for online chatting. When user wants to start talking, he should press the call button for onceone button on the Bluetooth headset. But it seems that the BroadcastReceiver object that I created couldnt receive any broadcasts when I press the buttons on the headset. The following is how I initialized the BroadcastReceiverp  precodeIntentFilter filter  new IntentFilterBluetoothHeadset.ACTIONVENDORSPECIFICHEADSETEVENT BroadcastReceiver eventReceiver  new BroadcastReceiverString cmdintent.getStringExtraBluetoothHeadset.EXTRAVENDORSPECIFICHEADSETEVENTCMD registerReceivereventReceiver, filter codepre  phowever, it is possible to receive connection state broadcast by setting the intentfilter with AudioManager.ACTIONSCOAUDIOSTATEUPDATED.p  pI read several posts mentioning that the constant ACTIONVENDORSPECIFICHEADSETEVENT doesnt work in Jelly Bean. Then do you guys know other ways to capture button pressing event from the Bluetooth headset  p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I read the source code of the phone app from source.google.com. In package com.android.phone.BluetoothHandsfree, I found out this method strongbroadcastVendorSpecificEventIntentstrong. so the system does broadcast the AT command intent. but in my application I still cant receive this kind of broadcast, my guess is that the system receiver has consumed the broadcast which is sent by BLuetoothHandsfree object. anyone knows how to set higher priority than the system receiver in order to retrieve this kind of broadcastp  pBy the way, Ive tried the method setPriority in class IntentFilter by setting Integer.MaxValue, however, it didnt work.  p

Negative 35343 pIs there a way to set the priority of a client in Strophe.js manually for an xmpp connection.p  pI am communicating with a google talk server, and have 2 seperate clients. One client signals the availability status onlineofflineetc....The other will be for receiving messages regardless of the other clients status.p  pa hrefhttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc3921.txt relnofollowhttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc3921.txta Section 11.1.4p  pSpecifies thatp  blockquote   pFor message stanzas, the server SHOULD deliver the stanza to the   highestpriority available resource if the resource did not provide a   value for the  element, the server SHOULD consider it to   have provided a value of zero.  If two or more available resources   have the same priority, the server MAY use some other rule e.g., most   recent connect time, most recent activity time, or highest   availability as determined by some hierarchy of  values to   choose between them or MAY deliver the message to all such resources.    However, the server MUST NOT deliver the stanza to an available   resource with a negative priority if the only available resource has   a negative priority, the server SHOULD handle the message as if there   were no available resources defined below.p blockquote  pSo essentially I want to set a negative priority for one client, and a positive priority for the other.

Maybe its good to note that the header regex.h is present usrinclude, though I see no specific library for it in usrlib or usrlocallib, though Im not aware if thats relevant.  This is just a side project for fun so Im not using a customized build system, just a regular C project in Eclipse.p  pIm not real experienced when it comes to modifying a build process other than setting include paths, libraries, etc., especially when an IDE like Eclipse is driving it, but my assumption is that the compiler and linker GCC G isnt configured for C11, though Ive tried various recommendations from SO and the Eclipse forums, like adding stdc11, but I just keep seeing output saying that theyre unrecognized arguments.p  pIm sure someone out there has dealt with this issue.

Negative 35343 pright now i have a project in which i need to build a search engine, but i cannot use Solr, only nutch and lucece, tho while im searching in forums and such i find out alot of people saying nutch does the indexing, i installed nutch 1.4 and crawled data, but realized i got no index folder or something like that, only the crawled data.. So, the question is, does nutch actually index what it crawls or it needs Lucene for indexing and searchp  pPS. for this project, i cant use Solr, only pure nutch and lucene and i need to build everything using Java, so im really confused when people says that nutch does in fact index...

Negative 35343 pIm in the situation where I have a Domain Model that is clean. By clean I mean its just a collection of private properties and getter and setters. I guess thats whats ment by the Anemic Data Model.p  pThis model is interchangeable with other applications can be shared with other application code without pulling in extra dependencies.p  pThis model needs to be serialized to different data formats. For this I can use a wide range of annotations that greatly simplify my life.p  pOnly they pull in an extra set of dependencies in all the projects that will share the domain model. Ive read its not advised to clutter the domain model for such reasons and I could possibly land in a Jar Hell.p  pI could write a wrapper that is annotated and pass in the domain model in the constructor and copy all the properties over to the annotated model. This way I can happily use annotations while keeping a clean Domain Model that will not enforce any extra dependencies.p  pThis is not specifically about serializing your data model but about adding extra functionality for example through annotations in your Domain Model that enforces new dependencies.p  pHow do you handle such use cases whats a safe way to handle this without having to fear Jar Hell p

It now appears to me that calling codesessionstartcode when the page switches back to HTTP creates a new session cookie that overrides the secure cookie.p  pThis means that codesetcookiecode and codesessiondestroycode might be acting upon the new session instead of the old one. I am more concern that the old session data residing in my server may not be properly destroyed.p  pIn this case, how does one goes about coding the HTTP logout page to ensure that the old session data is really destroyedp

Since it is using JQuery Mobile, all of the HTML is retrieved in a single request, and clicking on buttons brings up new pages over the default page. p  pThe test I am writing should click a button that brings up a new request pagep  precodeDefaultSelenium selenium ... selenium.clickcssa[hrefnewrequestpage] codepre  pThe driver seems to be finding this button just fine because Selenium doesnt throw any exceptions. However, no page ever pops up over the default page, so the user cant see what is going on. Despite this, the test seems to keep running as normal until it runs into a later unrelated error.p  pIs Selenium actually finding and clicking the new request button If so, what can I do to get the driver to load the new request page If not, why is it not letting me know that it cant find the new request buttonp  pI have read from others that I may need to tell the test to wait for Ajax calls to finish before starting the next step of the test, so that is my next solution. However, I was wondering if anyone else out there was having similar issues.p  pUnfortunately, I cannot post the link to the web app itself since it exists on our intranet and requires a company login to view. The test is being carried out in Firefox and is using the default Selenium web driver.p

Negative 35343 pI am writing a multithreaded application where there a n producers who tries to add an element to the shared resource. I want to maintain the order in which producer produces the element in the shared resource. p  pFor example my shared resource is a SynchronizedQueue and P1, P2, P3, P4 are going to produce a new elements in the order p1, p2, p3, p4 and during that time P5 producer is adding its element to the queue, so P1, P2, P3, P4 will be waiting for the lock. Once P5 releases the lock any one of the P14 will acquire the lock, so we loose the order of elements.p  pIs there a way to maintain the order of elements who wait for a lock  From my understanding it is not possible but I would like to check whether this can be achieved programmatically. p

Negative 35343 pAt my workplace there is a shared powerful 24core server on which we run our jobs. To utilize full power of the multicore CPU I wrote a multithreaded version of a longrunning program such that 24 threads are run on each core simultaneously via codethreadingcode library in codeJythoncode.p  pThe program runs speedily if there are no other jobs running. However, I was running a big job simultaneously on one core and as a result the thread running on that particular core took long amount of time, slowing down the entire program as threads needed to join the data at the end. However the threads on other CPUs had long finished execution  so I basically had 23 cores idle and 1 core running the thread and the heavy job, or at least this is what my diagnosis is. This was further confirmed by looking at output of codetimecode command, sys time was very low compared to user time which means there was lot of waiting.p  pDoes operating system codeLinuxcode in this case not switch jobs to different CPUs if one CPU is loaded while others are idle If not, can I do that in my program in codeJythoncode. It should not be difficult to query different CPU loads once in a while and then switch to one that is relatively free.p  pThanks.p

Negative 35343 pIm a beginner to Android development and Im implementing an address book app. This app will need an add contact screen and an edit contact screen. These screens are going be pretty similar  add contact is essentially going to be the edit contact screen but for a new blank contact and with a different title in the action bar. Should I implement them as separate layouts and activities they are going to be accessed using different buttons or is there a way that I can avoid duplicate code maybe using strategy objects or somethingp  pThanks for any advice.p

Negative 35343 pim new to unittesting and trying to follow TDD. p  pI my codeCardStackTestcode, there is number of tests, like these...p  precodepublic function testGetTopStackThrowsExceptionIfFirstArgumentNotInt public function testGetTopStackReturnsNullIfNoCardsAvailable public function testGetTopStackReturnsInstanceOfCardStack public function testGetTopStackRemovesAmountOfCardsFromStack public function testGetTopStackReturnsRestOfCardsIfNumberHigherThanCardsAvailable codepre  pNow... these are all working and all is fine and gladly accept hints for better test method naming. p  pMy question is. In my mind, i have already invisioned a codegetBottomStackcode method. And i know it will need exactly the same testing as my codegetTopStackcode method. Maybe i would add one extra test beyound this. p  pMy first idea was to make private method like codetestReturnsInstanceOfCardStackcode and then make the public test point to the private. p  pstrongBut should i write each test in same fashion, or is there a way to dry this up, maybe making some reusable testsstrongp
Negative 35343 pIm trying to make some jQuery functions a little easier to implement and so I tried to encapsulate some autocomplete logic into a function to allow a user to send in a variable of the URL, the parameter of the web service and the control whose value we need to take. With the following script I get the error coderesponse is not definedcode.

Firstly, the object now has multiple responsibilities and secondly, from a domain driven perspective, it seems wrong as I wouldnt expect a letter to arrive at my desk which declares itself to be valid or not or know how to convert itself into something else.p  pCould someone explain why this is good in DDDp

Negative 35343 pLong time reader first time poster Im playing around with the boostmultiindex container stuff and have a rather indepth question that hopefully a boost or C container expert might know my knowledge in C containers is pretty basic. For reference, the boost documentation on composite keys can be found here a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1331libsmultiindexdocadvancedtopics.htmlcompositekeys relnofollow titlehttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1331libsmultiindexdocadvancedtopics.htmlcompositekeysboostmultiindex composite keys.ap  pWhen using a composite key, the documentation states that Composite keys are sorted by lexicographical order, i.e. sorting is performed by the first key, then the second key if the first one is equal, etc. Does this mean that the structure is stored such that a lookup for a specific 2part composite key will take On1 time, i.e. is the container sorted such that there is a pointer directly to each item, or does the boost container retrieve a list that matches the first part of the composite key and then need to perform a search for items matching the second part of the key and thus is slowerp  pFor example, if I was to maintain two containers manually using two different indices and wanted to find items that matched a specific 2part query I would probably filter the first container for all items matching the 1st part of the query, and then filter the result for items that match the 2nd part of the query. So this manual method would effectively involve two searches. Does boost effectively do this or does it improve on efficiency somehow via the use of composite keysp  pHopefully Ive explained myself here but please ask questions and I will try my best to clarify exactly what I meanp

Negative 35343 plog service is recommended over console.log for AngularJS apps. One common use case for such logging is seeing debug print when running tests. The problem is, angularmocks silences log by default replacing it by a mock. Well, I do sometimes need to test my debug print, but I just need to see it much more often. The problem is, the default behavior insists on using dummy logging and I dont even see a proper way to revert back to real log.

Negative 35343 pI wonder where is the best way to validate the input variables. You could apply this question for every framework, but in my case it is Symfony2 the controller is a class which handles methods like individual controllers.p  pE.g. I have a Controller Class where each action is a methodp  precodenamespace MSDHomeBundleController  use SymfonyBundleFrameworkBundleControllerController use MSDHomeBundleEntityImagen as Imagen  class HomeController extends Controller         public function indexAction              if isset POST[whatever]  ampamp whatever  intval POST[whatever]                       iFoo1  whatever  25            iFoo2  whatever  32             return thisgtrender MSDHomeBundleHometemplate.html.twig, array foogt array foo1gtiFoo1, foo2gtiFoo2                      ...      codepre  pcodewhatevercode is validated inside the controller action. But you could create a method for each kind of operation. E.g.p  precodeprivate function multiply iNum1, iNum2       return  iNum1  iNum2     private function divide iNum1, iNum2       return  iNum1  iNum2   codepre  pand you should validate the parameters of each functionp  precodeprivate function multiply iNum1, iNum2       return  intval iNum1   intval iNum2      private function divide iNum1, iNum2       return  intval iNum1   intval iNum2    codepre  pand call them from the controllerp  precodenamespace MSDHomeBundleController  use SymfonyBundleFrameworkBundleControllerController use MSDHomeBundleEntityImagen as Imagen  class HomeController extends Controller         public function indexAction              if isset POST[whatever]  ampamp whatever  intval POST[whatever]                       iFoo1  this gt multiply whatever, 25             iFoo2  this gt divide whatever  32              return thisgtrender MSDHomeBundleHometemplate.html.twig, array foogt array foo1gtiFoo1, foo2gtiFoo2                        ...      codepre  pbut then youre validating codePOST[whatever]code three times in the codeifcode condition and in the two private functions. However, Im guessing this should be the safer way to validate, because you couldnt forget to validate, since each function validates their own parameters. But also implies duplicated validations.p  pIm not sure if there is a better way to proceed. Im not able to find a better solution, keeping the max security without duplicating validations.p
Negative 35343 pIll start by saying hello This forum has been a great help to me over the past few months, but have only now joined and asking my first question. Im working with the Northwind database in SQL Server 2008 r2 to build a vb.net application. Ive been wrecking my head for a week trying to figure out how to make an orderinvoice form. I can get the information I need to display using separate stored procs GetCustInfo, GetOrderInfo, GetProductInfo, or something like that, but Im having trouble figuring out how to display them on the form.  When I select all the info I need in one sp as in the Invoice view which comes built in the db, I get 2155 rows, which is the number of items which have been ordered in the company history.  What I want to do is display this information, but navigate by OrderID which would give me 830 rows, each with a certain number of products related to the OrderID. So Im thinking I need different stored procs related which can be related in some way.  Id really appreciate any help that can be given on this.p  pMany thanks in advance.p  pp.s. I have screenshots of the Northwind sample app which shippedships with Access, which is really what Im trying to recreate in SQL Server. Unfortunately, no code MMp

Negative 35343 pI wrote a simple daemon in Python which is based on Gevent. The daemon needs to do some cleanup before it exists, so it is necessary that it can handle the TERM signal, preform its cleanup and exit gracefully. In a single threaded daemon which is not based on Gevent, I used the Pythons signal module to set a signal handler for the TERM signal. The signal handler throws an user defined exception which is called codeTermSignalcode. The main thread of the daemon can just catch the TermSignal exception, do its cleanup and exit.p  pThis solution did not work as expected when I tried to implement it in a daemon based on Gevent. The daemon has a main greenlet that calls codejoinallcode on the workers greenlets. the codejoinallcode call is wrapped in tryexcept block which catches the codeKeyboardInterruptcode, which allows the daemon to preform its cleanup when it runs without daemonizing. However, when I implemented the solution above and sent a TERM signal to the process, I could see in the console window that one of the worker greenlets raised the codeTermSignalcode exception instead of the main greenlet. This uncaught exception did not proagate to the main greenlet, despite the face that I called codejoinallcode with coderaiseerrorcode parameter set to codeTruecode. The result was that one of the worker greenlets crashed due to the exception, but the daemon did not exit at all.p

Negative 35343 pIm stuck. I have a slightly complicated hierarchy of views. One UITabBarController to rule three UINavigationControllers. In each NavigationController I has a root UITableViewController that spaws others of its kind. All are subclassed. Everything was working yesterday, and after adjusting some scrollview insets and switching to blocks, I have a problem. p  pWhen I push another TableViewController onto the navigation stack everything is ok. But, when I pop that TableViewController and log the contentSize of the root TableViewController p  precodeviewWillAppear           contentSize 320, 15063.414 viewWillLayoutSubviews   contentSize 0, 0 viewDidLayoutSubviews    contentSize 0, 0 viewDidAppear            contentSize 0, 0 codepre  pThis only happens when popping from my custom TableViewController to another TableViewController of the same kind. Any idea whats going on presumably in codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscodep  pI am suspecting something might be up with the TabBarController or NavigationController but Im still drawing a blank.p  pIve updated what was logged to include codeviewWillLayoutSubviewscode and codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode. It appears everything is zeroed out before AutoLayout even gets its hands on it. Is that assumption correctp  h2Edith2  pThe same patter of setting content size properly and then setting it to zero also happens when I push a view controller on top. Then when I pop it off, it sets the proper contentSize and then removes it.p  pIve come up with a workaround. I cache my cell heights so in codeviewWillLayoutSubviewscode I set the contentSize properly. The problem still persists if I present a view modally because codeviewWillLayoutSubviewscode isnt called. Something is weird still.p
Negative 35343 pIve got a GameScreen where I have 100 dots randomly bounce around the screen. Im currently adding a UI button in order to rotate the screen one on the left and one on the right.

Negative 35343 pI have an App where the first time its run, it opens a settings page. Simple thats done.  when you put the app in the background and you rerun it doesnt open the settings page  which is correct, but when you double press the button and swipe the app away it brings it back to when it was installed in the first place so the settings page opens. p  pI have done all of this with NSUserDefaults.  So in DidFinishLaucningWithOptions i have put an IF statement, so if the boolforKey is blank never used then set it to YES and run the settings page.  When the settings page has been used it sets the boolforkey back to NO, so it doesnt run again when you relaunch the app to the foreground. p  pbut when you swipe the app away it must reset the NSUSerDefault to YES and it shows the settings page. p  pCan anyone suggest where I should set the NSUSerDefault to NO so when its relauched from swiping it away it works. p  pAnyhelp please  p  pthanks p

Negative 35343 pAs the title says, what is this thing and how do I handle itp  pIts a codeQObjectcode and asks for a codeQObjectcode as its parent. But at the same time it has child objects that are clearly codeQWidgetscode. p  pTypically with codeQObjectcodes, you can either let the parent delete it when the parent is deleted, or you can delete it yourself. But codeQSystemTrayIconcode doesnt seem to work this way  Ive tried making it the child of an arbitrary QObject and then letting its parent delete it  when I do this, a lingering event gets sent to the QSystemTrayIcon thats been parentdeleted. On OSX this segfaults because it ends up sending an obj message to an invalid object. p  pThis might be because the QMainWindow is going away at the same time in my application.p  pIf I have to delete it explicitly after unchilding it, why And if thats the case, it sounds like this is timingdependent or something. p  pIf codeQSystemTrayIconcode really just wants a codeQWidgetcode as its parent, why isnt its constructor written that way p

Negative 35343 pSo I am building a large menu out using a rather large JSON object. I originally tested it with about 250 nodes and the performance was fine. Since that was the scope for the project I wrote it off as completed and moved on.p  pNow the scope of the project requires there to be more than 3,000 nodes in the menu. In Chrome it takes about 34 seconds for the menu to be rendered, which is unacceptable enough. Then theres the fact that IE8 needs to be supported and takes almost a full minute to render the menu and you begin to see my problem.p  pNow normally I would build out a giant DOM string in JavaScript and apply it once its done and it would take lt1sec to build out the same DOM.  The problem is that all of the menu items have to be filtered based on checkboxes, which is why AngularJS was used in the first place, for realtime filtering of menu items not to mention easy rendering with recursive includes which lowered initial development time.p  pSo now I am stuck with trying to find a way to get Angular to create thousands of nodes quickly that are still databound so they can be filtered. Im already using a custom function to hideshow the nodes instead of having them be built out every time which made the menu blazing fast when addingremoving filters. Now I just need to find a way to get over this initial rendering hump.p  pHere is the markup for the menu itselfp  precodeltscript typetextngtemplate idmenuitemrenderer.htmlgt ltdiv classmenuitemgt     lta ngshowcategory.link hrefcategory.link classmenuitemtitle targetcategory.targetgt         category.title     ltagt     ltspan ngshowcategory.link classmenuitemtitlegt         category.title     ltspangt     ltspan classmenutogglebtn ngshowcategory.categories datangclasschildrenFilteredcategory.categoriesgtlti classiconplus gtltspangt     ltspan classmenuitemborder ngshowcategory.categoriesgtltspangt ltdivgt ltul classmenucategorylist listunstyledgt     ltli datangrepeatcategory in category.categories datangclassfilterResultscategory datangincludemenuitemrenderer.html classmenucategorygtltligt ltulgt codepre  pp        li   pThe JSON object is huge, but Ive set up a JSFiddle for you all so you can take a look at the render times.  Note that the JSON object is in an NGINIT due to the implementation restrictions of the application. This is how it is in my actual application, which is why Ive included it in the same manner here.

Although its usually not a lot of extra code, there is a bit of extra effort involved, and it certainly makes some things more cumbersome say, when you have some conditional rules about screen layout that depend on the data itself.p  pThere are quite a few cases in an app Im implementing where data really is mostly static.  Like, for example, when showing the times a restaurant is open at.  That data simply wont change, and its known at the time we initialize the screen.  Because Im somewhat new to the pattern Ive been kind of just blindly binding stuff everywhere.p  pNow that Ive done this quite a bit, Im reflecting on how silly it is in certain situation to do the databinding at all, for what is essentially read only data that wont change.p  pIm thinking I already know the answer here, but wanted to see what people think, overall.  Are there reasons that are not obvious, where its better to just data bind everythingp

Negative 35343 pI am using RMStore to verify receipts.  As a note, I am not using RMStore for the actual purchase portion.  The process is successfully dealing with success and failure in terms of throwing errors and not delivering content if the receipt is invalid.  I purposefully changed the bundle to force a failure as a test.  My question though is with the failure process and the confirmation Apple sends.p  pThe issue is that while this process does detect the failure to verify and therefore does prevent the content from being sent to the user, Apple still afterwards comes back with a dialog box about the purchase being successful.  The good news is that the purchase isnt successful and the content isnt delivered, but I would prefer that this dialog box from Apple not show as it will create confusion.p  pHere is my implementation of the check.

Negative 35343 pThis is my second post related to Java Swing, so pardon me if my question is too straightforward. Im trying to get multiple JPanels to communicate with each other. Im building a simple 2D grid that I can add wallsblocked cells to, and then run a simple FloodfillA Search algorithm on given start and goal locations. p  pTo isolate my issue, I decided that working with an example would be easier. So I created a simple application, that allows the user to write to a text box, strongprovidedstrong that heshe has clicked on a Start button. Once writing to the text box is done, the user can click on the Start button to flip it to the Stop state. In the Stop state, the user cannot add any text to the text box i.e. the application should not register any keystrokes at all. This is a simple problem that really brings out my question here. Heres how the UI looks like right now p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIlcXn.jpg altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.coml2FPM.jpg altenter image description herep  pstrongemMy questionemstrong I strongshouldstrong be able to write when the button shows Stop since it is in edit mode and I strongshouldntstrong be able to write in the text area when the button shows Start since it is not it edit mode. However, from the above images, you can see that Im able to write in the text area in any case. How do I then make the editing of the text area emdependentem on the button statep  pHeres my code which attempts at setting up that connection between the button panel and the text panel, but it somehow isnt working as expected.p  pI looked at StackOverflow posts a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9759792communicatingbetweenjpanelsherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4690892passingavaluebetweencomponentsherea, but frankly, the answers didnt seem clear to me.p  pstrongSimpleTextPanelstrongp  precodepublic class SimpleTextPanel extends JPanel implements PropertyChangeListener, ChangeListener        private boolean canWrite     public SimpleTextPanel            set the border properties         canWrite  true         TitledBorder title  BorderFactory.createTitledBorderSimple Text Panel         title.setTitleColorColor.BLACK         title.setBorderBorderFactory.createBevelBorderBevelBorder.LOWERED,                 Color.DARKGRAY, Color.GRAY         this.setBordertitle          JTextArea editSpace  new JTextArea10, 20         editSpace.setEditabletrue         editSpace.addPropertyChangeListenerthis         this.addeditSpace           Override     public void stateChangedChangeEvent changeEvent          JButton button  JButtonchangeEvent.getSource         canWrite  button.getText.equalsStart           Override     public void propertyChangePropertyChangeEvent propertyChangeEvent          JTextArea area  JTextAreapropertyChangeEvent.getSource         ifcanWrite area.setTextStringpropertyChangeEvent.getOldValue       codepre  pstrongSimpleButtonPanelstrongp  precodepublic class SimpleButtonPanel extends JPanel implements ActionListener       JButton switchButton     private boolean canWrite  true      public SimpleButtonPanelSimpleTextPanel txt            set the border properties         TitledBorder title  BorderFactory.createTitledBorderSimple Button Panel         title.setTitleColorColor.BLACK         title.setBorderBorderFactory.createBevelBorderBevelBorder.LOWERED,                 Color.DARKGRAY, Color.GRAY         this.setBordertitle          switchButton  new JButtonStart         switchButton.addActionListenerthis         switchButton.addChangeListenertxt         this.addswitchButton           Override     public void actionPerformedActionEvent actionEvent          ifswitchButton.getText.equalsStart              switchButton.setTextStop             canWrite  false          else ifswitchButton.getText.equalsStop              switchButton.setTextStart             canWrite  true                codepre  pstrongSimpleExampleTeststrongp  precodepublic class SimpleExampleTest extends JFrame       public SimpleExampleTest           setLayoutnew BorderLayout         setTitleSimple Example         setSize300, 300         setLocationRelativeTonull         setDefaultCloseOperationEXITONCLOSE          SimpleTextPanel text  new SimpleTextPanel         SimpleButtonPanel button  new SimpleButtonPaneltext          addtext, BorderLayout.NORTH         addbutton, BorderLayout.SOUTH         button.addPropertyChangeListenertext  so that text editor knows whether to allow writing or not            public static void mainString[] args           EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable              Override             public void run                  SimpleExampleTest ex  new SimpleExampleTest                 ex.setVisibletrue                             codepre  pAnyall help is appreciated.

Negative 35343 pIm using the mongoose Schema.postsave, postSaveCallback method in order to send updates over a socket to display the state of the world in the database to subscribed clients in a web browser. I am wondering if the post save callback is guaranteed to be executed in the same order that the save method was called This would guarantee that the state represented in the client view is the accurate state of the world. If the ordering of these post save callbacks is not guaranteed to be in the same order that the mongoose save method is called, it would mean that the clients view could potentially get out of sync with the real database representation.p  pIs there a better way to do this or is my approach sensiblep  pFurthermore, is it guaranteed that when postSaveCallback is called the save operation on the underlying mongodb has fully completed and was successfulp  pWould be very grateful for any pointers on this.p  pThanks in advance.p

This time the image location will be  codeABCimagescodep  pI do not want to change  codeABCimages..code for all the image url in my Gwt app, then the question is codehow to config the server so that i can see my imagescodep
Negative 35343 pI am currently implementing a asynchronous document renderer by using the windows 8.1 native pdf renderer. My goal is, to to have this renderer render each pdf page asyncrounasly, but it should be possible to change render direction or to overwrite the current render position these changes are triggered by user interactions. Background for this is, to use this renderer for my own document pager in an Windows Store App. A user should be able to jump to page XX without to wait for it to be rendered in order, but rather jump to it immeadeatly.p  pSo much for the background.p  pThe renderer I implemented so far does work perfecly but I noticed, that it isnt really asynchronous. My DocumentRenderer class has a PagRender which does the actuall rendering for one individual page. The method call to render a page is asynchronous, but the rest isnt If another part of my DocumentRenderer takes longer my UI Thread is blocked. For example if I override the render position with User input my renderer has sometimes to ignore XX pages because he rendered them already. This is mostly a issue for huge PDF ducuments I usesd the PDF Reference with 1300 pages where the renderer sometimes had to ignore hundreds of pages. p  pImportend to mention is, that I have two events defined One for ImageRendered and one for RenderingFinished. To use the Renderer I have to subscribe to theese events and handle the rendered images in the UI the DocumentPager.p  pOk here is the code of my render method p  precodepublic async void Render      var rendered  ImageRendered     if rendered  null              return           while AllPagesRendered                     Debug.WriteLineTag  gt Direction Forward             while RenderPosition lt mPageRenderer.getPageCount                                                    if IsPageRenderedRenderPosition                                                                Debug.WriteLineTag  Page   RenderPosition   was ignored... already rendered                      RenderPosition                     continue                                                         Uri ImageURL  await mPageRenderer.RenderPageRenderPosition                 string t  ImageURL.ToString                 ImageItem image  new ImageItemnew Urimsappx  ImageURL.AbsolutePath, RenderPosition                     Debug.WriteLineTag  Render Image at position   RenderPosition                 RenderedImages.Addimage                 renderedthis, new RenderArgsimage                                   RenderPosition                  if RestartRendering                                           Debug.WriteLineTag  gt Restart Renderer... at position   NewPosition                     RenderPosition  NewPosition                     RestartRendering  false                                   if ChangeDirection                                          Debug.WriteLineTag  gt Change Direction.

Big drop indeed. The other stuff that I draw doesnt change. How the adding of the filter make the bitmaps to draw 23 times slower. How Btw the Paint that is used have no antialiasing or dither set. If i set the dither to true however, the fps drops slightly, only slightly. Is there a better way to do it Help me, please. p

Negative 35343 pIm sorry if this question had been asked previously but i could not find any information whatsoever.p  pMy question is pretty straightforwardIs there any algorithm that can determine the number of disjoint simple paths between every pair of vertices in an undirected connect graph.Disjoint paths are such paths that dont have common vertex except the start and end vertices.p  pI used a modified version of BFS to find all paths between each pair of vertices and then compare each path for a common vertex but this procedure is really slow and Im not really sure about its accuracy.p

Negative 35343 pIf I use cloudfront with an S3 origin to serve a web site that has two files.  Lets say index.html and app.js.  Now if I make changes to the html file and app.js for example remove some functions and add some new functions.  Now the way cloudfront works is that the files have an expiration date that I believe is 24hours.  So once 24 hours is up then a request to cloudfront wil check the s3 bucket to see if the file has changed. This is fine if the files both expire at the same time, but what if the html file expires 4 hours after the javascript file  p  pThis would mean that the old HTML File could be calling a function that existed in the old javascript file.  However the new Javascript file is being served and it no longer has this function.  This would result in an error.  p  pTo deal with this, you can send an invalidation request, for both files and when this completes the new content will be served.  Invalidation requests can take some time, I personally have seen 1015 mins for a request to complete.  So if I push the edited fileshtml,js out to my S3 origin and send an invalidation request and it takes 15 mins to complete. Then just after I send the invalidation request the js file expires and the new JS file is pulled with the old HTML file...My site could be throwing an error for 15 mins  p  pWHat if I am serving my html from my servers and just pulling the js from cloudfrontS3  Do I have to time the change of the html on my local server exactly with the successful invalidation request on cloudfront p

Negative 35343 pEvery time when i deal with code signing and provisioning profiles strange things happens. Most times i get the error no code signing identity found and if not then something like no matching provisioning profiles found and no provisioning profiles with a valid signing identity.p  pAlthough i am quiet familiar with the theory and the things behind code signing and provisioning, there are still lots of pitfalls I everytime ran into and i dont know how to deal with. Sometimes it fails when setting up a new App, sometimes not.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQGMaa.png altenter image description herep  pThere are 52 different ways to select code signing identity. What is the difference between them And if i select one for debug and one for release, what is the reason for the strongAny iOS SDKstrong p  pAlso, there are two places giving this dialog ProjectSettings  Buildsettings is the first place, and also for the Target under Build Settings. Both are not in sync, so if i change the code signing at the first place, i have to change it twice in the second place. Is there a way to keep them in syncp  pWhich code signing identity would fit best into the various lines debug, debug  any ios sdk, release, release  any ios sdk, since i can choose between developer identities and distribution identities i could imagine, that the distribution one is for release and the developer one is for debug, but because of everything fails, i dont know.p  pWhat I didp  pThere a valid certificates in the Member Center deposited for each developer of our team and one for ad hoc distribution for the Team. We also created AppIDs which reflects exactly the same setting in the Project Settings. In between we avoid using Variables and use the exactly appid also in projectsettings to reduce risks on this side and to simplify things.p  pWhen switching the provisioning profile from Automatic to a specific Profile for this App, the code signing identities change to different values, which are also not in sync between the project settings and target build settingsp  pOn the TargetBuild Settings we get this result img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGCMZk.png altenter image description herep  pOn the Project  Build Settings we get a different result img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVDPwq.png altenter image description herep  pWhich one would be more accurate  After Product  Archive  Validate we get the following errorp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0Dxeb.png altenter image description herep  pIt doesnt matter here if we select different Code signing identities or not.

But most tutorials around this topic are outdated since several changes happened between XCode 4 and XCode 6. Even the apple documents offer mostly screenshots based on outdated XCode versions and also outdated versions of Member Developer Center.p  h2Updateh2  pAs Ian McDonald pointed out correctly, the last question covered by the last 2 screenshots is answered.

Negative 35343 pI screwed up and thought that it would be a good idea to try to convert my project into a gradle project without having any knowledge of how that system works. I converted the project inside of eclipse by using configure  convert to gradle project.

Negative 35343 pI am looking for a way to compute a solution to a boolean system of equations using the XOR operation. I found a hrefhttpmath.stackexchange.comquestions169921howtosolvesystemoflinearequationsofxoroperationa questiona similar to this, but it didnt show a way to compute it.p  pGaussian elimination always seems like something you just have to think through, and I have no idea how I can create a program to do this. Especially for a system that has several solutions. Right now I would be fine if I could find an algorithm that would just find one solution, but being able to find all solutions would be great.p

Negative 35343 pI am trying to implement Facebook login for my android app. However, instead of using the LoginActivity, as suggested on the developer a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsfacebookloginandroidv2.2 relnofollowwebsitea, I have added the Facebook login button on a separate fragment. This fragment simply holds the button and does all the processing, which otherwise the LoginActivity would have done. The purpose of using a separate fragment is to prevent doing everything in the LoginActivity, specially if other login options like Google also exist.p  pNow the problem is that the UiLifecycleHelper constructor accepts only Activity object for callbacks p  precodeUiLifecycleHelperActivity, StatusCallback codepre  pBecause of this, I am bound to do something likep  precodeUiLifecycleHelpergetActivity, callback codepre  pSo, eventuallyp  precodeoverride onActivityResult... codepre  pis called in LoginActivity, instead of in my fragment which hosts the login button.p  pNow the authentication wont work, unless I explicitly call codeonActivityResultcode method in the fragment from codeonActivityResultcode from the codeLoginActivitycode. Because it is the fragment who has created and is maintaining the UILifecycleHelper object.p  pI want to avoid adding this hack in the codeLoginActivitycode, specially since, theres no way for me to know if the codeonActivityResultcode was called as a result of Facebook authentication process.p  pWhats a proper way to achieve thisp

Help me visualize and understand the concept below and how the class structure should be for the given bean definition. Will these bean definitions be in the same XML Per the Spring Docsp  blockquote   pemSpecifying the target bean through the parent attribute creates a reference to a bean that is in a parent container of the current container. The value of the parent attribute may be the same as either the id attribute of the target bean, or one of the values in the name attribute of the target bean, and the target bean must be in a parent container of the current one.

Negative 35343 pMy company has a large code base and we recently started implementing bootstrap v3.3.4.p  pWe have 100 clients that all run through the same website, using a url like codehttpswww.company.comclienthomeindexcode.p  pWe use the codeclientcode part of the url to identify the client, and apply their specific settings and styles that make the site look and run differently, as if its their own site. We currently only allow 20 clients to have custom styles, but that might change in the near future.p  pWhen we initially implemented bootstrap we wanted to keep the core bootstrap styles codebootstrapcommon.csscode that are common to all clients separate from the clientspecific bootstrap styles codebootstrapclient1.csscode, codebootstrapclient2.csscode.p  pThis was a good idea for caching purposes and because changes to the less in codebootstrapcommon.csscode would not cause all of the clientspecific less files to be recompiled. However, it was problematic because if we wanted to do something simple like override codebrandprimarycode for a client, we had to not only override the variable in codebootstrapclient1.lesscode but since it was compiled separately from codebootstrapcommon.lesscode we had to override all of the css from codebootstrapcommon.lesscode that used that variable. Major code duplication and a maintenance nightmare.p  pWe have since switched to having each client have their own compiled bootstrap css file that includes all of bootstrap, our common overrides and styles, and the clientspecific overrides and styles. p  pThis solves the problem of overriding bootstrap variables and having the core bootstrap compiled with those overrides included. This means all we have to do in the client less file is set the codebrandprimarycode variable, and bootstrap will use that variable everywhere.p  pHowever, it isnt good for caching because the corecommon boostrap styles arent separated out into its own css file. If you switch between clients, or you change anything in the common or client less, a new file has to be downloaded, instead of having separate files that can be cached individually. Also, if you make one change in the corecommon less files, every single client less file has to be recompiled.p  pIm new to bootstrap and less, and after doing some research I havent been able to find anyone with this same use case. Does anyone know of a goodstandard way to handle this situationp

Negative 35343 pI have a program that uses the SVC class from sklearn. Really, Im using the OneVsRestClassifier class which uses the SVC class. My problem is that the predictproba method sometimes returns an vector thats too short. This is because the classes attribute is missing a class, which happens when a label isnt present during training.p  pConsider the following example code shown below. Suppose all possible classes are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Now suppose training data just happens to not contain any data labeled with class 3. This is fine, except when I call predictproba I want a vector of length 4. Instead, I get a vector of length 3. That is, predictproba returns [p1 p2 p4], but I want [p1 p2 p3 p4], where p3  0.p  pI guess clf.classes is implicitly defined by the labels seen during training, which is incomplete in this case. Is there any way I can explicitly set the possible class labels I know a simple work around is to just take the predictproba output and manually create the array I want. However, this is inconvenient and might slow my program down quite a bit.p  precode Python 2.7.6  from sklearn.svm import SVC from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier import numpy as np  Xtrain  [[1], [2], [4]]  10 y  [1, 2, 4]  10 Xtest  [[1]]  clf  OneVsRestClassifierSVCprobabilityTrue, kernellinear clf.fitXtrain, y   calling predictproba gives [p1 p2 p4]  I want [p1 p2 p3 p4], where p3  0 print clf.predictprobaXtest codepre  pThe workaround I had in mind creates a new list of probabilities and builds it one element at a time with multiple append calls see code below. This seems like it would be slow compared to having predictproba return what I want automatically. I dont know yet if it will significantly slow my program because I havent tried it yet. Regardless, I wanted to know if there was a better way.p  precodedef workAroundprobs, classes, allclasses          probs list of probabilities, output of predictproba but 1D     classes clf.classes     allclasses all possible classes superset of classes          allprobs  []     i  0   index into probs and classes      for cls in allclasses         if cls  classes[i]             allprobs.appendprobs[i]             i  1         else             allprobs.append0.0      return np.asarrayallprobs codepre

Here is what I have donep  pMade a script to get a random sample of Ids for paramaters only one table used at the moment  thats fine.p  precodeALTER PROC [dbo].[UpdateValidationGETRandomIdSample]TestSizePercent DECIMAL6,3 AS  This table is already created and will persist both sides of the update CREATE TABLE LiveCompanion.dbo.UpdateValidationIds  Id          INT IDENTITY1,1NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED  ,MyTableId   NT               NULL  IF TestSizePercent gt 100 RAISERRORDo you even percent, bro,16,1 DECLARE SQL VARCHAR255 TRUNCATE TABLE UpdateValidationIds  SET SQL  INSERT dbo.UpdateValidationIdsId SELECT TOP   CONVERTVARCHAR10,TestSizePercent   PERCENT ID FROM Live.dbo.MyTable ORDER BY NEWID EXEC SQL codepre  pMade a second script to run a stored procedure for each Id in the tablep  precodeALTER PROC [dbo].[UpdateValidationGETProcedureResultsManyTimes]ProcedureName VARCHAR255 AS  DECLARE ProcedureName VARCHAR255  LiveCompanion.dbo.MyProc  DECLARE ID INT DECLARE GETID CURSOR DECLARE SQL VARCHARMAX   DECLARE MyTableId INT DECLARE FirstRun BIT  1 SET GETID  CURSOR FOR     SELECT Id FROM LiveCompanion.dbo.UpdateValidationIds     WHERE MyTableId IS NOT NULL OPEN GETID FETCH NEXT FROM GETID INTO ID WHILE FETCHSTATUS  0 BEGIN     SELECT MyTableId  MyTableId FROM LiveCompanion.dbo.UpdateValidationIds     WHERE Id  ID      IF FirstRun  1     BEGIN         SET SQL  SELECT  INTO ProcedureOutput FROM OPENROWSETSQLNCLI,ServerSQL1TrustedConnectionyes,EXEC   ProcedureName     CONVERTVARCHAR50,MyTableId           SET FirstRun  0     END     ELSE     BEGIN         SET SQL  SQL           INSERT ProcedureOutput SELECT  FROM OPENROWSETSQLNCLI,ServerSQL1TrustedConnectionyes,EXEC   ProcedureName     CONVERTVARCHAR50,MyTableId       END     FETCH NEXT FROM GETID INTO ID END  SET SQL  SQL   SELECT  FROM ProcedureOutput DROP TABLE ProcedureOutput EXEC SQL  CLOSE GETID DEALLOCATE GETID codepre  pSo now I should be able to execute the second procedure for various stored procedures and output the results to file over a range of Ids, then repeat using the saved initially random Ids again after the update and compare the results.p  pThe trouble is, it fails when any of the called procedures use a temporary table EDIT Error Message returnedp  blockquote   pCannot process the object EXEC LiveCompanion.dbo.MyProc 12345.

Negative 35343 pIm learning about hash tables and quadratic probing in particular. Ive read that if the load factor is lt 0.5 and the tables size is prime, quadratic probing will always find an empty slot and no key will be accessed multiple times.

What does this mean Surely if we keep adding items, the load factor will increase until it equals 1 whether we want it to or not. So what is implied when my textbook says I should maintain a small load factorp

Negative 35343 pThere are three containers, small, medium and large. Passenger comes in, checkin the luggage. The baggage should be stored in the appropriate container and generate a unique token number. Then passenger should get back the bag using the same token number.  Trick was if small container is full store in medium if available or large. Now if the large bag comes in and there is now a empty space in small, than move the small bag back to small amp store the large bag.  How to generate the unique token number and move the baagage internally without changing the token numberp  p1 Lookup should be in constant time complexity and insertion in minimum complexity. 2 We can use the hash tables to store the token numbers, but token number shouldnt get changed if you move the baggage internally and space should not get wasted in the memory if baggage is removed.p  pIs there any efficient way to solve this  Thanks in advance. p

Negative 35343 pIm trying to bind a reference, for example codeJtxR26sMFPJ7RmXHjccode to an object that was passed to a function.

Negative 35343 pCan you help me duplicating rows generically in DB2 please The task is to duplicate rows that match a certain criteria like WHERE versionabc and reinserting them into the same table with updated value on some columns like versionabc1.p  pWith generically i mean, that i cannot explicitly list the attributes of the rows, it has to work for arbitrary tables.p  pEDIT for clarificationp  pLets say there is a table with the attributes ID, NAME, VERSION. Now i want to copy some rows of this table WHERE version4 into the same table but with version increased by 1. For this i need an SQL statement.p  pThe same SQL statement should work on a table with the attributes ID, COUNTRY, VERSION.p  pSo, there is always the technical ID and there is always the VERSION.

Now it gets mapped and rendered out to display seperate elements. Those elements have content which consist of an img and 2 icons. One icon is clickable.p  pThe clickable icon calls a function which passes some content to the parent component in which another function gets called to alter the state and set state codecurrentPic, display and displayBgcode.p  pcurrentPic now contains an array with the img src and everything needed. The other two states got changed with one class from dn to db from display none class to display block classp  pNow a div gets shown above the content containg an img and two more icons. behind the div there is a 100 width and height black background which has an onClick function. The onClick function is called hide, it changes the state back from db to dn from display block class to display none classp  pSomehow react doesnt only change the class but also creates an inline style which looks liek that styledisplaynone p  pSo when I click the icon to show the popup again the classes get changed fine but the inline style attribute is still there and overwritting all class styles...p

Negative 35343 pSay that I am building a simple web app with a REST backend where users have their own page with user information.p  pWhat I would like to achieve is, if an unauthenticated user makes a request to p  pemwww.mywebapp.comapiuserjohnemp  pthey would be provided with limited information only age and email for example. But if the users logs in, and makes the same request, the server will also respond with more information like personal preferences and such. p  pI am thinking that maybe the middleware that validates the users token, passes on permission on the request req.role  guest or req.role  user. Then in the username endpoint it would check the role and respond with different content.p  pThe other option would be to make a new route endpoint for authenticated users, and then check which one to call on the client side.p  pWhat is best practice herep

But this is an absolute nuisance as Im resetting the database a good bit during development.p  pHave I set this up wrong Thanks for looking.p  blockquote   pstrongError messagestrongp blockquote  precode    rake aborted     ActiveRecordAssociationTypeMismatch Team33344260 expected, got Fixnum8019940     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordassociationsassociation.rb216in raiseontypemismatch     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordassociationsbelongstoassociation.rb12in replace     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordassociationssingularassociation.rb17in writer     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordassociationsbuilderassociation.rb118in team1     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordattributeassignment.rb45in publicsend     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordattributeassignment.rb45in assignattribute     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordattributeassignment.rb32in block in assignattributes     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordattributeassignment.rb26in each     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordattributeassignment.rb26in assignattributes     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordcore.rb455in initattributes     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordcore.rb198in initialize     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordinheritance.rb30in new     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordinheritance.rb30in new     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordpersistence.rb33in create     homealzerworkspacepawchallengedbseeds09matches.rb1in lttop requiredgt     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactivesupport4.1.5libactivesupportdependencies.rb241in load     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactivesupport4.1.5libactivesupportdependencies.rb241in block in load     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactivesupport4.1.5libactivesupportdependencies.rb232in loaddependency     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactivesupport4.1.5libactivesupportdependencies.rb241in load     homealzerworkspacepawchallengedbseeds.rb1in block in lttop requiredgt     homealzerworkspacepawchallengedbseeds.rb1in each     homealzerworkspacepawchallengedbseeds.rb1in lttop requiredgt     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactivesupport4.1.5libactivesupportdependencies.rb241in load     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactivesupport4.1.5libactivesupportdependencies.rb241in block in load     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactivesupport4.1.5libactivesupportdependencies.rb232in loaddependency     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactivesupport4.1.5libactivesupportdependencies.rb241in load     varlibgems1.9.1gemsrailties4.1.5librailsengine.rb543in loadseed     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordtasksdatabasetasks.rb184in loadseed     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordrailtiesdatabases.rake173in block 2 levels in lttop requiredgt     varlibgems1.9.1gemsactiverecord4.1.5libactiverecordrailtiesdatabases.rake132in block 2 levels in lttop requiredgt codepre  blockquote   pstrongmodelsmatch.rbstrongp blockquote  precodeclass Match lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto team1, classname Team, foreignkey gt team1   belongsto team2, classname Team, foreignkey gt team2      defaultscope  orderid   Always orders the match objects by id when retrieved end codepre  blockquote   pstrongmodelsteam.rbstrongp blockquote  precodeclass Team lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany match   defaultscope  orderworldranking, rank   Always orders the team objects by world ranking then rank when retrieved end codepre

Negative 35343 pI have been experimenting with retrieving data from an MSSQL server from a Delphi program using Delphi 2007. The program has so far been using TADODataset to retrieve data. During tests we found that TQuery with an ODBC provider fetched a large select of data much quicker. But on the other hand TADODataset preformed much better with parametrizedprepared selects. Both TADODataset and TQuery connect to the same MSSQL database table. For this experiment I used MSSQL Native Client as provider for both.

Problem is, i cant figure out how to delegate down this task.p  pMy Code looks like this at the momentp  precodepublic class MainClass extends JFrame implements ActionListener      ..... other stuff     public MainClass           MainPanel mainPanel  new MainPanel          .... other stuff    class MainPanel extends JPanel       private GameWindow currentWindow      public MainPanel           currentWindow  new StartWindowthis           public void paintComponentGraphics g          g.drawRect 10, 10, 200, 200   lt can see on the window         abstract class GameWindow       contains game loop and update functions and so on    public class StartWindow extends GameWindow       GamePanel parentWindow      public StartWindowGamePanel parentWindow          super         parentWindow  parentWindow           public void paintComponentGraphics g          Does not work         g.drawRect 20, 20, 100, 100         codepre  pthe parentWindow contains the MainPanel, so i should have all the information that is needed to draw on its Panel, i just cant figure out how to do it.p  pEdit Minimum example thats workingp  precodeimport javax.swing. import java.awt. import java.awt.event.  public class MainClass extends JFrame implements ActionListener   public static void mainString[] args            System.out.printlnProgram Window1        MainClass glt  new MainClass        glt.setVisibletrue      ..... other stuff public MainClass       superFixed Timestep Game Loop Test     Container cp  getContentPane     cp.setLayoutnew BorderLayout     JPanel p  new JPanel     p.setLayoutnew GridLayout1,2        System.out.printlnProgram Window2     MainPanel gamePanel new MainPanel      cp.addgamePanel, BorderLayout.CENTER     cp.addp, BorderLayout.SOUTH     setSize500, 500  .... other stuff  Override public void actionPerformedActionEvent arg0       TODO Autogenerated method stub      class MainPanel extends JPanel   private GameWindow currentWindow  public MainPanel       currentWindow  new StartWindowthis   public void paintComponentGraphics g      g.drawRect 0, 0, 200, 200   lt can see on the window     abstract class GameWindow   contains game loop and update functions and so on    class StartWindow extends GameWindow   MainPanel parentWindow  public StartWindowMainPanel parentWindow      super     parentWindow  parentWindow   public void paintComponentGraphics g      Does not work     g.drawRect 20, 20, 100, 100     codepre
Negative 35343 pIve been working on an app extension for quite some time but it seems like iOS 9 breaks the status bar when I rotate the device while using the extension.p  pIve made some screenshots with the simulator but it also happens on a real device.p  pHeres a screenshot before rotation  a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comyi6XZ.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyi6XZ.png altBefore Rotationap  pHeres a screenshot after rotating the device  a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comrglke.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrglke.png altafter rotating the deviceap  pHeres a screenshot of safari after exiting the extension  a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqCi9T.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqCi9T.png altsafari screenshotap  pAs you can see the status bar is broken and I believe this is caused by iOS 9.p  pIs there something I can do to fix this problem I dont want to disable rotationp
Negative 35343 pHow can I convert an codeNSDatecode to seconds I need it in seconds so that I can added 30 secs to the date and then convert back to codeNSDatecode to schedule a local notification. Any better ways of doing that are welcome too.p
Negative 35343 pI have been scouring Google for the better part of my morning trying to find an Org Chart solution for an editable organization chart but almost all of my searches bring me back to a hrefhttpcodepen.iosiironpenaLkdE relnofollowthis suggestion.ap  pNow, this would be fine however, when I try to remove a department the layout gets completely destroyed and attempting to fix it is time consuming and confusing to me. I liked this layout a lot and I was hoping that this would be the solution I needed but it is currently too hard to work around changes.p  pIve also look at D3JS but it seems a little bit overboard for what I actually need to do. I only need a few nodes as it is so if its possible, Id like an HTMLCSS only solution however, if JS is the route I need to take that would be ok too.p  pAgain, Im looking for responsive designs and, so far, nothing but the CodePen example seem to satisfy that.p  pThanks ahead of time.p  precode HTML  ltdiv classcontentgt   lth1gtResponsive Organization Chartlth1gt   ltfigure classorgchart cfgt

Why does it crashp
Negative 35343 pi have a problem with what seems like session timing out and being destroyed, though i currently do not have it set to expire after a certain amount of time, nor do i have the session destroyed anywhere in the code.p  pHeres what happens in detail, p  pits an ecomm site i have 90  built which also has two payment gatewaysPayPal and SecurePay.p  pfirst of all, i only have this problem when the website is uploaded to the web hostGoDaddy, i havent experienced this issue using localhost.p  pThe issuep  ol liI can use my site, everything functioning normal, i can choose products and checkout successfully through both payment gateways without      issue. When i am finished for the day ill close the browser as per normal.li liThe next morning i will again open the browser and navigate to my site. The website has still retained all the session information and i can navigate to all my pages without issue, including my shopping cartmy shopping cart especially relies on session data to work.li liDuring the first time i go to checkout, with strongeitherstrong payment gateway, everything functions fine until payment gateway navigates back to my returnURL, where the session is somehow destroyed, all the session data is gone and i am logged out.li liThis only occurs once, specifically the first time i test the checkout process after a long period of inactivity. As i log back in after the session is destroyed the issue is does not appear to happen again, until the next morning.li liI would also like to add that the return urls are quite different for each payment gateway, the PayPal returnURL is a page where the order is still being processed and the user can change shipping methods rates, SecurePay returns to a page where the transaction is complete and an invoice is genrated, though the result is the same and the session is destroyed when returning from either payment gateway to the return url.li ol  pTo fix this i was just going to expire the session after 1 hour of session inactivity. But im curios why the session would be destroyed only after returning from the payment gateway and not as soon as the page is opened after such period of inactivityp
