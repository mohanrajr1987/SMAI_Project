Once assigned, I can access the site with either the IP or the domain name. Now with this new AWS way, theres no info in the tutorials about how I obtain new IP Addresses. I tried adding a new local IP like 10.0.0.30 because it says its in NAT mode and use local IP and assigning this as a dedicated IP to the newly created accounts but I dont understand how anybody can access the site through that IP since its a local IP. So how do I access the domain through custom IP and domain like I did before I must be missing something fundamental.p  hr  pstrongMy second issuestrongp  pOn my dedicated WHM after I created a new account, I would typically go to DNS Functions  Edit DNS Zone and edit the zone to customize my nameserver as sop  pcodemynewdomain.com ns1.mynewdomain.com  ns2.mynewdomain.comcodep  pcodeanothersite.com ns1.anothersite.com ns2.anothersite.comcodep  pcodethirdsite.com ns1.thirdsite.com ns2.thirdsite.comcodep  pand then in my register I would add these custom nameservers into the register and point them to the dedicated IPs of each domain.

In the cases where these tests are failing a System.NullReferenceException is thrown, Application.ExecutablePath appears to be returning the test runners executable instead of the DLL of the test assembly.p  pIs there a value other than Application.ExecutablePath I should be using were currently using it to get access to the values inside the .config file for the DLL  What is the NUnit GUI doing or not doing that causes it to behave correctly while other test runners are failing  p
Negative 33388 pI am trying to help a small business that has an application that could benefit from occasional or temporary database expertise.  The problem is, this company has all their IP in this database, so they are rightfully hesitant to give someone access it.  p  pThey would typically meet and gain trust in person, but the talent pool within physical proximity to them is pretty limited.  I would like to think that they could still somehow tap into the global DBA expertise though...p  pEven the crappiest DBA will be able to dance SQL Circles around these guys  so exposing only pieces of the database doesnt sound feasible to me, but I am hoping I just dont know how. p  pAnyone have any tips on how they could find a trustworthy company or individual  When I hire a programmer, I start them on basic stuff that if they mess up wont hurt too much.  With a database, is there something that I can start with that can limit their exposure.  Maybe Profiler output for analysis or somethingp
Negative 33388 pIm working on a Python package named lehmer that includes a bunch of extension modules written in C. Currently, I have a single extension module, rng.

Negative 33388 pI have a somewhat complex UserControl, and Visual Studio 2008 is giving me a rather harmless annoyance when working with it.  Every single time I open the control with the Designer, it decides to immediately change some of the harmless values set by the designer  namely the initialization of Size properties.  If I save those changes, close, and reopen, it almost invariably ends up deciding another component of my control needs its initial size changed, ad infinitum.  Luckily these changes are harmless since Im using automatic sizing everywhere, but this is quite annoying to work with.  I havent the foggiest on where to start figuring out whats going wrong, my only thought right now is that the Designer is assigning the results of autosizing back into the initial size fields every time I open the control.  Any ideas on causesfixesp  pstrongEditstrong Also, I am using Application Settings to save sizes of certain resizable child components across runs of the application, but I really hope the Designer is smart enough to understand that it should only ever be using the defaults.  p

Negative 33388 pIn an Eclipse RCP application I am trying to open many editors. It is a basically a tree with lot of nodes each of which opens an editor. When I open in access of 150 to 200 editors and try to open an editor for next treenode it doesnt open. Eclipse console shows org.eclipse.swt.SWTError No more handles. However if I close a few of already opened editors I am able to open as many new treenode editors.p  pI monitored the memory usage for javaw.exe memory grows on opening of each editor but number of handles remain constant after a certain MAX. javaw.exe consumes around 120,000K when the error happens. The total memory consumed by all applications during error is 700,000K. And if I try to open a few more applications like IE it either doesnt open or opens with lesser UI features due to shortage of system memory. And all this in spite of having 2GB RAMp  pI also tried by increasing vmargs in eclipse memory settings but it wasnt of much help either.p  pa  Is there a memory leak in my code I dont see it as handles remain constant after a certain MAX.  As I understand, as editors are open, the SWT controls on it are not disposed until they are closed.p  pb  Whats the max. memory that can be used up by applications As my RAM is 2GB and I see that my overall memory to all processes should be way better than 700,000K which I think is around 680MB.p

Negative 33388 pIm new to JMS and I am working on setting up ActiveMQ with Tomcat 6 and Spring.  I have most of the basic things configured however Im a little bit confused with the Message Listener Containers that Spring provides.  Reading the documentation it sounds like the Message Listener Container is used to handle subscribing Im working with Topics, unsubscribing and delivering the message to the listener.  I not sure if Im thinking about this correctly.  If this is the case I dont see any documentation on how I would have multiple classes subscribe to the same topic using the Message Listener Container.  I see that you can set the messageListener property but that would only allow one class to be able to subscribe to a topic.  It doesnt seem right to create another instance of the same Message Listener Container just to have another subscriber Message Driven POJO listen to the same topic.p  pCan anyone shed some light on this for me  I think I may be a little confused.  p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 33388 pOk, basically I have a run loop going in my application every second or two, while at the same time I have another thread going that is looping through the codelistenForPacketscode method codebroadcastMessagecode is only initiated when another action method takes place. The important part of this question is that when the listener thread is running seperately from the main thread, it never print out any of the print commands and it seems to not allow access to a global variable that I have defined called coderecvMessagecode which lies outside of the interface and implementation sections.p  pIn my code, I have it set up so that every time it runs through the main run loop, it updates a UILabel in my GUI. When the app is running, my label stays blank the whole time and never changes. Ive doublechecked the GUI and everything is linked up there correctly and my label is instantiated correctly too I use the name label as an instance of UILabel in the code below. Does anyone have any ideas why my label is updating The networking aspect of things is fine I believe, because I just got that done and everything is talking ok.

Negative 33388 pI read the latest a hrefhttpwww.codinghorror.comblogarchives001299.html relnofollowcoding horror posta, and one of the comments touched a nerve for mep  blockquote   pThis is the type of situation that test driven designrefactoring are supposed to fix. If big if you have tests for the interfaces, rewriting the implementation is riskfree, because you will know whether you caught everything.p blockquote  pNow in theory I like the idea of test driven development, but all the times Ive tried to make it work, it hasnt gone particularly well, I get out of the habit, and next thing I know all the tests that I had originally written not only dont pass, but theyre no longer a reflection of the design of the system.p  pIts all well and good if youve been handed a perfect design from on high, straight from the start which in my experience never actually happens, but what if halfway through the production of a system you notice that theres a critical flaw in the design Then its no longer a simple matter of diving in and fixing the bug, but you also have to rewrite all the tests. A fundamental assumption was wrong, and now you have to change it. Now test driven development is no longer a handy thing, but it just means that theres twice as much work to do everything.p  pIve tried to ask this question before, both of peers, and online, but Ive never heard a very satisfactory answer. ... Oh wait.. what was the questionp  pHow do you combine test driven development with a design that has to change to reflect a growing understanding of the problem space How do you make the TDD practice work for you instead of against youp  pstrongUpdatestrong I still dont think I fully understand it all, so I cant really make a decision about which answer to accept.  Most of my leaps in understanding have happened in the comments sections, not in the answers. Here s a collection of my favorites so farp  blockquote   pAnyone who uses terms like riskfree   in software development is indeed full   of shit. But dont write off TDD just   because some of its proponents are   hypersusceptible to hype. I find it   helps me clarify my thinking before   writing a chunk of code, helps me to   reproduce bugs and fix them, and makes   me more confident about refactoring   things when they start to look uglyp blockquote  pKristopher Johnsonp  blockquote   pIn that case, you rewrite the tests   for just the portions of the interface   that have changed, and consider   yourself lucky to have good test   coverage elsewhere that will tell you   what other objects depend on it.p blockquote  prcoderp  blockquote   pIn TDD, the reason to write the tests   is to do design. The reason to make   the tests automated is so that you can   reuse them as the design and code   evolve. When a test breaks, it means   youve somehow violated an earlier   design decision. Maybe thats a   decision you want to change, but its   good to get that feedback as soon as   possible.p blockquote  pKristopher Johnsonp  blockquote   p[about testing interfaces] A test would insert some elements,   check that the size corresponds to the   number of elements inserted, check   that contains returns true for them   but not for things that werent   inserted, checks that remove works,   etc. All of these tests would be   identical for all implementations, and   of course you would run the same code   for each implementation and not copy   it. So when the interface changes,   youd only have to adjust the test   code once, not once for each   implementation.p blockquote  pMichael Borgwardt p

For reasons not known to me, Crystal parameters are not translated into SQL parameters, so you end up with queries selecting everything from the order header history table inner joined to everything in the order lines history table, which results in over 8 million rows.p  pIs there a way to get Crystal Reports to use the parameters in the SQL query instead of loading all the records and filtering after the fact I read somewhere that a stored procedure should work, but Im curious if an ordinary parameterized query is possible in the interest of saving my time.p  pHere is the selection formulap  precode     trimOrderheader.ordno  Order No  and      Orderheader.ordtype  O  and       orderlines.ordtype  O codepre

Nonprogrammers make a lot of grammar mistakes they misspell keywords, they dont close parentheses, they dont terminate blocks, etc.p  pIm using ANTLR to generate my parser it provides a nifty mechanism for handling RecognitionExceptions to improve error handling.  But Im finding it pretty hard to develop good errorhandling code for my DSL.p  pAt this point, Im considering ways to simplify the language to make it easier for me to provide users with highquality error messages, but Im not really sure how to go about this.

I am perplexed a little by this as the two images I generate for the user to drag around and set as startend point are both instances of a class I created draw2d that subclasses UIImageView so I can drag it about.p  pSo at present I am adding two UIImageViews to my UIViewController in order to drag them about  you cant draw a line between two UIImageViews as such as the only drawing I know how to do is IN the UIImageView.p  pDo I need to nest these two images in a parentstyle UIImageView so I can draw between themp  pAny assistance is always greatly appreciated.p

Negative 33388 pI have an application into which I wish to allow users to enter login details for their own websites. One of authentication methods is forms. The way I had envisaged it working, is the users entering the method amp action of their login form, and the namevalue for each credential item, e.g. one for username, one for password. My application would then post this data in order to simulate a login, get the returned authentication cookie and be able to work on their site as if logged in.p  pIn principle, this sounded like a reasonable kind of thing to do. However, as Im sure youre aware, ASP.NET has a lot of inputs, and also hidden ones, e.g. VIEWSTATE, which are all always posted back to the server whenever the ASP.NET form is submitted e.g. when a emrealem user logs in. When my app tries to login however, it doesnt have the full list of inputs on that page, and their values, e.g. the always changing VIEWSTATE.p  pMy question is there a way to post data to an ASPX page, posting emonlyem certain inputs, and excluding others, e.g. VIEWSTATEp  pIf the page were, say, PHP it would probably look like thisp  pEx. 1p  precode... ltdiv idheadergt     ltform actionsearch.php actionPOSTgt         ltdiv idsearchgt             ltinput typetext namequery idSearchQueryText valueSearch query gt             ltinput typebutton namesubmit idSearchSubmitButton valueSearch gt         ltdivgt     ltformgt     ltform actionlogin.php actionPOSTgt         ltinput typetext nameuname idUsername valueUsername gt         ltinput typetext namepasswd idPassword valuePassword gt         ltinput typebutton namesubmit idLoginSubmitButton valueLogin gt     ltformgt     ... ltdivgt ... codepre  pin ASP.NET Web Forms, however, through the use of server controls, itd probably look likep  pEx. 2p  precode... ltbodygt         ltform nameAspNetForm methodpost actionProductsSomethingOrOther.aspx idForm enctypemultipartformdatagt         ltdiv idheadergt             ltdiv idsearchgt                 ltinput typetext idctl00SearchComponentSearchBox namectl00SearchComponentSearchBox valueSearch query gt                 ltinput typesubmit idctl00SearchComponentSearchSubmit namectl00SearchComponentSearchSubmit valueSearchgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv idlogingt                 ltinput typetext idctl00LoginComponentUsername namectl00LoginComponentUsername valueUsername gt                 ltinput typetext idctl00LoginComponentPassword namectl00LoginComponentPassword valuePasswordgt                 ltinput typesubmit idctl00LoginComponentLoginSubmit namectl00LoginComponentLoginSubmit valueLogingt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ...     ltformgt ltbodygt ... codepre  pWith example 1, submitting the login form is a simple case of POSTing unamesomethingamppasswdsomethingelse to login.php, however, in ASP.NET, because all inputs are wrapped in a global codeltformgtcode, to submit the login inputs, you have to submit the global form, and therefore all the inputs.p  pSo what Im after, is a way to submit emonlyem certain inputs in that global form, e.g. not VIEWSTATE, which we cant know without probing the page beforehand.p

I need main to restore any calculators that are in the file calc.bak before presenting the user with a menu and main should save all calculators that exist in that same file overwrite as appropriate just before exiting. I also need to give the user the option to create a brand new calculator, name it, and add a function to it from an already existing collection which are my Add, multiply, and divide. I also need the user to create their own function by designing and naming a combination of any pair of functions. The ouput of the first function would necessarily be input to the second function. For example, the user can create a new function called addmult that calls the add function which prompts for two numbers and adds them and establishes the sum as one of the operands for the multiply function which would have to prompt for its second operand.  p  pThe sample out put should look like this Welcome to the Calculator Configuratorp  ol liprestore a calculator from a filepli lipcreate a

Negative 33388 pIm looking for a good, free, java based webapplication framework with good support for mobile devicesp  pI have a web application which I initially wrote for normal browsers using the Vaadin framework. I have been very happy with this framework. However, my application now also needs to support browsers on mobile devices phones and pads. Unfortunately Vaadin does currently not do this very well even on pads things look wrong and the page is hard to interact with using Vaadin widgets.p  pSo I have come to the painful conclusion that it may be time to port my application to a different web framework to minimize work, ideally also Java or even GWT based. Is there any framework you would recommend that supports both normal browsers and mobile browsers well and ideally automatically detects what browser it is interacting with and adapts to thatp  pNote Im aware that there is a mobile Addon for Vaadin, but it is very expensive if you cant live with AGPL, only in beta, and apparently hasnt had an update in over a year. So, its not looking like an option for me.p

Negative 33388 pI am currently learning how to create Firefox addons using XPCOM and I want to know how to include thirdparty libraries to develop them. I followed a few tutorials to compile .xpt and .dll from c files noted in a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenHowtobuildabinaryXPCOMcomponentusingVisualStudio relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenHowtobuildabinaryXPCOMcomponentusingVisualStudioa and a hrefhttpnerdlife.netbuildingacxpcomcomponentinwindows relnofollowhttpnerdlife.netbuildingacxpcomcomponentinwindowsa and I am not sure how we are suppose to include the files into an addon project which gets packaged into .xpi file.p  pI am using Opencv c to do image conversions via the addon such as resizing a very large image 3mb high res png down to something small and simple such as 600X800 200kb jpg that will be done by my addon. I know that Opencv is written in c and xpcom can compile c code into a dll and xpt. I read a couple of tutorials but most of them points to adding these files xpt and dll in CProgram Filesx86Mozilla Firefoxcomponents instead of the addons components folder which is not how addons work, I believe. Though the Mozilla page listed above does include something about appcomponents and appapplication.ini folders but I have never read anything like this, so therefore I am confused how this is done.p  pMy other option is making the Opencv methods into an executable and then running it separately similar to how MemoryFox addon runs an executable to clear Firefoxs memory and use that to conduct image resizing.p  pI am really not sure how to do this I am new the addon development and I would like to know how to accomplish this using 3rd party C libs into the addons. An example, tutorial or explanation is fine to get me started.p  pThanks in advance.p  pEdit I would also like to inform that I have read threw most of a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenCreatingXPCOMComponents relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenCreatingXPCOMComponentsa picked and choose topics and it does not tell me how to achieve the above.p

Negative 33388 pthank you for taking the time to read this.p  pThe situation is basically, Im using EnumProcessModulesEx to enumerate all the modules in a loaded process. Ive verified that the process Im getting with GetCurrentProcess is correct via the ID. I seem to be getting all the loaded modules except the one I want Its a C DLL that is only loaded when the C DLL function is called. I made sure the DLL was loaded before I ran the enumerating function. Is there a reason this C DLL wont show upp  pI also put this enumeration after I load a couple of other C DLLs in my C code. It doesnt seem to be finding those either. All of these C DLLs are dynamically loaded. I figure it shouldnt matter because a everything is mapped into the process address space anyways, and b I have a C DLL that is injected dynamically loaded and I can find that just fine. My goal is to be able to hook a C DLL function, so being able to find these C DLLs is a must in this project. p  pThank you all again for any tips or insights p
Negative 33388 pIs there a method to calculate something like general similarity score of a string In a way that I am not comparing two strings together but rather I get some numberscores hash for each string that can later tell me that two strings are or are not similar. Two similar strings should have similar close scoreshashes. p  pLets consider these strings and scores as an examplep  pHello world                1000p  pHello world               1010p  pHello earth                1125p  pFoo bar                    3250p  pFooBarbar                  3750p  pFoo Bar                   3300p  pFoo world                 2350p  pYou can see that Hello world and Hello world are similar and their scores are close to each other.p  pThis way, finding the most similar strings to a given string would be done by subtracting given strings score from other scores and then sorting their absolute value.p  pMy end aim is  there would be streaming log messagesonly pure messages and i wanna find the pattern of those messagessome sort of regular expression type.But that gets started only when i can bucket similar strings.

Negative 33388 pI always assumed that booleans were more efficient than ints at storing an onoff value  considering thats their reason for existence. I recently decided to check if this is true with the help of jsperf, and it came up with some contrary resultsp  pa hrefhttpjsperf.comboolvsinthttpjsperf.comboolvsintap  pHere is the first test I tried. Toggling the value of the onoff switch. On Chrome its significantly faster to do this using 10, but on firefox its slightly faster to do this using bool. Interesting.p  pa hrefhttpjsperf.comboolvsint2httpjsperf.comboolvsint2ap  pAnd heres the second test I tried. Using them in a conditional. This appears to have significant advantage for ints as opposed to bools, up to 70 faster to use 10 instead of booleans  on both firefox and chrome. Wtfp  pI guess my question is, am I doing something wrong Why are ints so much better at booleans job Is the only value of using bools clarity, or am I missing something importantp
Negative 33388 pI have a project that Im trying to build an installer for using a Visual Studio setup project. Im wondering if there is a way to get the MatLab Compiler Runtime included as a prerequisite. Right now I have to include the MCRSetup.exe and have the user run that first and then my installer. Not too onerous but I was just wondering if there is a way to make it all happen in one step, so that the MCR stuff gets installed the same way that .NET and the C runtime libs get installed. p  pI did try going to the prerequisites tab but there is no choice for selecting the MCR not that I expected one. I also tried adding the MCRInstaller.exe to my Application Folder. This almost works much to my surprise. The MCR Installer runs automatically and appears to be the last step. However, it fails before it gets very far because it senses that another installer is running which is my project that launched it and the user is instructed to quit that installer first. Im sure my users will find this confusing and I was hoping to make it a little more seamless. p

If I click the submit button without filling out any field, the appropriate error messages are printed for the text input fields but not the text area field.  If I fill out all fields correctly and leave the message field blank, the form gets processed correctly and values are placed in the database and the success message is printed out.  This is also the case when I enter a value for message textarea field.  Now I tried something.  I changed the textarea to a text field and the SESSION[message] variable finally got echoed when I left this field blank.  So apparently, the problem arises from the fact that the named attribute from a textarea tag is not being processed correctly  Who knows whats going wrong herep

Negative 33388 pIm working on a web application, where the backend is built in MVC 3. When I run my project in Visual Studio 2010, the app is making jQuery Ajax calls to the IIS to get the data, which is then displayed in the browserfrontend.

In Visual Studio, I have to type UsersListUsers as the url for the Ajax call, however, when I try to call the same url by using httplocalhost51845UsersListUsers in Aptana, the Ajax request is made but there is no data returned, which seem to have something to do with the same origin policy.

Negative 33388 pI was wondering if this is an unwholesome use of a factory pattern, or if it is completely reasonablep  precodeltphp ConnectionFactory.class.php             Generates prepared mysqli connection instances           class ConnectionFactory          public static function make             c  new mysqlilocalhost, testusername, fakepassword             if cgtconnecterror throw new ConnectionExceptionConnection failed             return c                   class ConnectionException extends Exception  gt codepre  pOr would an extension of the mysqli class with prepopulated arguments be more appropriate I had thought about doing this, but it felt like violating the purity of the mysqli class. Maybe Im thinking too much into it.p  pMy usage comes from having many classes which make database transactions. In all of the examples I have seen the usernamepasswordhostetc have been rewritten on each usage, which doesnt seem very OOPlike either. p  pIts worth noting that I would really prefer to use a Singleton, and this strikes me as the perfect opportunity for such only one connection is ever needed which would be a huge performance boost as I understand it but Im trying to avoid the temptation because I hear that they are considered OOP cancer.p  pPerhaps the problem is that I shouldnt be using the mysqli class in so many places and maybe use a class with static do query functions or something similar. All thoughts on the subject are greatly appriciatedp

Negative 33388 pIm writing an application which at start up posts a message to the server and waits for the response.

Negative 33388 pFor a project I am working on I am using two different threads to acquire images from different hardware on a Windows system using Opencv and C. For the purposes of this post we will call them camera1 and camera2. Due to varying frame rates I cannot capture both from both camera1 and camera2 on the same thread or try to capture one image at a time. Instead, I have buffers set up for both cameras. Camera1 runs at over double the frame rate of camera2.p  pA third thread gets a frame from camera2 and tries to match that to an image taken by camera1 at the nearest point in time. The problem I am having is that I cant find a good way to match an image from one source to an image that was acquired at roughly the same time in the other source.p  pIs there a method of assigning time stamps to these images that is accurate when used in separate threads that are not high priority If not, is there another design method that would be better suited to a system like this.p  pI have had a hard time finding any information as to how far off methods of keeping track of time in Windows like clock and queryperformancecounter are when used in separate threads on different CPUS. I have read that they are not accurate when used in separate threads, but I am acquiring frames at roughly 20 frames per second so even if they are off, it may be close enough to still work well.p  pThank you in advance Let me know if I should clear anything up or explain better.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pUnfortunately I dont think there is any way for me to get timestamps from the drivers or the hardware. I think I have figured out a way to pretty accurately determine when an image is actually captured relative to each thread though. The part I dont really know how to deal with is if I use clock or something similar in two threads that are executing on separate cores, how far off the time stamps could be. If I could count on the time stamps on two different cores being within about 25ms from each other, that would be ideal. I just havent really been able to figure out a good way to measure what the difference is between the two. I have done some more research and it appears that timeGetTime in the Windows API is not effected too much by being called by separate cpu cores. I am going to try that out.p

Problem is, neither of these things happen.  The code.holdReadycode appears to do nothing, and while the alertdone loading slicks fires properly, and web developer console reports no more errors, and scripts loading in the sequence I want, the grid isnt displaying, and the codedocument.readycode event fires as though the code.holdReadycode wasnt even there.

Negative 33388 pI refer to the code in the Connection class of the boostasio HTTP Server 3 example a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1490dochtmlboostasioexamplehttpserver3connection.cpp relnofollowhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1490dochtmlboostasioexamplehttpserver3connection.cppap  pIt can be seen that each of the async operations are invoked on a boostasioioservicestrand.  This ensures that the completion handlers will not be invoked concurrently.  However, the example server can be run with multiple threads calling ioservicerun which means any of these threads could be used to invoke the handlers.  All of the handlers in this example invoke methods on the boostasioiptcpsocket object.  To me, this is sharing the socket object between threads although not invoking methods on it concurrently.p  pI can see no synchronization around the socket calls so my question is what mechanism is in place for ensuring that each thread has the same view of the state of the socket object  The documentation clearly states that it is unsafe to share an instance of boostasioiptcpsocket.p

Also, there seem to be events only for TESTSTART and TESTCOMPLETE, but not for TESTFAIL. p  pIs there some other way to find out if a test failed, to stop the runner p

Negative 33388 pSo up until about 6 months ago, most of my work big graph processing consisted of Python and C. Up to that point, and even now, I had not written any Java whatsoever.. I had seen the language and was familiar with the syntax having come from a CC background, and liked the idea of the JVM, but never actually written any substantial amount of Java.p  pWhen I picked up Scala, I loved it, OOP and functional programming features all in one, and it being on the JVM was great. Ive been constantly striving to improve my Scala and have been playing with Akka, and still loving it. However, at times, perhaps it is just me overthinkng it, but I feel I should learn some more about Java andor the JVM.p  pIve heard from many that Scala should be considered a separate language from Java, much like C to C. Perhaps you may feel the same way, and perhaps learning Java is more or less disjoint from learning Scala, but Im feeling learning more about the JVM e.g. JIT compilation, type erasure would be helpfulp  pThoughtsp

Negative 33388 pIm very new to Magento development this is my first module. The purpose of this module is to fix some problems that we are having with the original one, while not making any changes to the modelcontroller. I am modifying this existing template, but I cannot seem to find a way to retrieve fields. The template is usingp  precodethisgtgetChildHtmlsubmitbutton codepre  pto submit the data. This is ultimately making a call to a javascriptajax function that pretty much leaves me at a dead end. Im simply wanting to get the values of, lets sayp  precodelttextarea namething[other] ...gt codepre  pHow would I retrieve that value so that my Model may manipulate it Overriding the controller is not an option, this page is essentially a duplicate of another that uses the same controllers. The functionality of that controller is desired for that one, just not desired for this one.p  porp  pMy other option is to override the template. My problem with that is that the original module is using an observer to override the template, and Im not sure how to override that.p

So i can make the redirection perfectly on the basis of screen width.p  pURL to TEST a hrefhttpradiations3.aiksite.comhome.html relnofollowhttpradiations3.aiksite.comhome.htmlap  pThanks,p

Negative 33388 pI have been maintaining a magento store technical aspect for few months and still learning. The google analytics shows the number of visitors and sources but there is no info regarding the content. When I went into the admin section, I was surprised to see that google analytics was enabled but still we could see the visitors count and other basic info.p  pWhile going through the code, I saw that analytics script was hardcoded in the footer of the website. All, I want to know is that, Is this a correct way to configure analytics for a magento site. And if yes, then why i cannot see any content details regarding the pages of website.p  pOr should I just remove the hardcoded code from the footer and enable the analytics through admin  sales  google api. p

Negative 33388 pI have a simple panel on a form and Im using AutoScrollMinSize and AutoScroll to get some scrollbars on my panel, all works OK.p  pI also have a Scroll event which I use to invalidate the whole panel area, as defacto it seems to only invalidate bits it needs to when scrolling leftright, updown.  In addition to this Im using a BufferedGraphics which is the same size as the panel then does a .Rendere.Graphics as Im wanting for it to draw upon the whole panel as if the scroll bars didnt exist.p  pNow, the problem I have is there seems to be a visual keep up lag when scrolling and the contents being painted, I assume this is because theres an extra draw  setup stage somewhere that Im not familiar with either before the Scroll event is called or between that and the Paint event being called.p  pIf I have a invalidate panel inside the paint method you dont see the problem, but this is more to do with the paint event being called many times hiding the issue.p  pSo the way I think I understand it is, when you scroll, something under the hood does a big rectangle blit shifting contents that already exist then calls invalidate with the rectangle of the area that needs to be filled.p  pIf this is the case, is there anyway around this, as in inhibit this stage or some other setup Im missing to get rid of the keep up lagp  pPS I also override the OnPaintBackground method which is an empty stub.p

Negative 33388 pA client has asked me to enhance one of their apps in order to send out an email containing an excel spreadsheet.

Negative 33388 pI have a piece of HTML that I need to modify and I need to keep the changes minimal out of CSS. All I need to do is to hide a table cell until something happens. So I went ahead and added the style tag as shown belowp  precodelttd styledisplaynonegt codepre  pHowever, this causes the style class to reset, e.g. the cell which used to be vertically centeraligned is now topaligned, and so on. My understanding is that this is because the style attribute overrides the default CSS stuff. Is that correct If yes, how can I prevent it I just need to add the display attribute, not reset the rest of style attributes.p  pI spend some time searching online and noticed that HTML5 has introduced something called scoped style. Is there an HTML4 easytodo equivalent for itp

Negative 33388 pThis is a follow up to a question I posted earlier, but was unclear then. I hope I can be more clear now.p  pIm using ASP.NET and C to validate a user after login on all secure pages. I emshouldem be able to do this without touching the web.config files so please avoid any such solutions that involve editing the web.config file.

This is obviously bad, so im wondering how I can use the initial session ID of a valid user to protect all subsequent pageloads from other users who have the direct page path, but not a valid login.p  pAt the moment, the only check I do in all secure pageload functions is to check wether codeMySession.GetSessionIdnullcode.

Officially speaking, all branches are in a perpetual alpha state.p  pI think what I need to figure out is how to subtree merge a emtagem.p  pRight now, Im doing this to read WordPress 3.5 into codewebrootwordpresscode and to namespace WordPress tags, and it worksp  precode git remote add t master notags wordpress gitgithub.comWordPressWordPress.git  git config add remote.wordpress.fetch refstagsrefstagswordpress  git fetch wordpress warning no common commits remote Counting objects 138547, done. remote Compressing objects 100 2829728297, done. remote Total 138547 delta 110613, reused 137367 delta 109624 Receiving objects 100 138547138547, 46.05 MiB  2.26 MiBs, done.

Negative 33388 pIve been testing async in WebForms and for once, my question isnt about how to do something, its about how something that already works, DOES work. This is my test codep  precodeprotected override void OnPreRenderEventArgs e      Response.WriteOnPreRenderltBrgt  protected override void OnPreRenderCompleteEventArgs e      Response.WriteOnPreRenderCompleteltBrgt  protected async override void OnLoadCompleteEventArgs e      Response.WriteOnLoadCompleteltbrgt     var t1  Task.Factory.StartNew gt          System.Threading.Thread.Sleep2000         return 1           This actually does run     Response.Writeawait t1.ToString  codepre  pSo my task pauses for a bit and then writes out the result. My question is  I wouldnt expect this to work because control has been yielded from the OnLoadComplete method  I would expect the page to actually finish rendering and be returned to the client before my task ever returned. p  pThe actual output isp  precodeOnLoadComplete OnPreRender 1OnPreRenderComplete codepre  pSo its clear that the OnLoadComplete method yielded control so that OnPreRender could run and then control returned to the OnLoadComplete. My expected result was that the 1 would never print because the subsequent events would fire and the pages thread would either be killed or the posttask write would happen after the response had been sent. I guess, given the above, its not surprising that even if I delay for 10 seconds, the result is exactly the same.p  pI assume theres some wiring in the WebForm engine that ensures any awaitables are completed before the next phase of the pages life cycle proceeded. Does anyone know for sure how this happens Im afraid to use asyncawait in methods that need to complete before other events for fear that the continuation will be too late, but if its handled internally, then I wont worry.p

Negative 33388 pi am currently using ajax polling to periodically get new data from a database and show it to a user. It works fine, except sometimes, the images fetched begin to flicker, and then the flickering suddenly stops. Here is the JavaScript that fetches the datap  precodefunction loadLog          .ajax         url stream.php,         cache false,         success functionhtml inner.htmlhtml                         setInterval loadLog, 2500 codepre  pthe stream.php file contains basic sql commands that check the database for new data. So these commands are called every 2.5seconds. If the post type is an image, it is accompanied by a statement such as username posted a new image, xseconds ago. The statements never flicker at all, but the image does. Is there a way to stop the flickering of the image An interesting thing is that, if the database already has images, then only newly posted images flicker, whereas the old images do not. So if there are in total 3 images, two old and one new, the new one flickers, whereas the other ones do not,despite the fact that the entire script is being polled and not specific images.p
Negative 33388 pIm using Castle Windsor and DynamicProxy to implement persistence Lazy Loading from scratch I know NHibernate could be an option etc. I have implemented a custom component activator to always instantiate my business classes as proxies. I found that the default mixin proxies automatically created when using interceptors were not being used when class methods are called from inside the class itself, which was a problem. So I inherited DefaultComponentActivator and overriding CreateInstance Im calling CreateClassProxy to get a proxy that inherits from the business class, which in that respect works fine.p  pNow I was expecting this ProxyComponentActivator activator of mine to be instantiated by Castle only once, but a new instance is being created for each class type.

Negative 33388 pHi Im getting ANR Application Not Responding errors but I cant understand why. If I click Wait everything works perfectly and the ANR doesnt come back anymore.p  pNow, I do know that when using MediaPlayer as a service is good practice using .prepareAsync and the onPrepared method rather than simple .prepare and .start. It doesnt lock the UI thread and works great.p  pThe problem is that all my ANRs are not happening when opening files you would guess higher processor there, but randomly when they are playing and when the cpu is at few  at most. As I mentioned earlier NOTHING is remotely close to being unresponsive and there is little left on the UI thread.p  pThe only clue is that I dont get ANRs the first time I play a track, but only after it has been changed. I thought that the prepareAsync threads were colliding and I added a lock myself. no change.p  pI tried to release the media player each time before starting a new track. no changep  pI tried to reset, stop etc in many sequences. no change.p  pHas anybody experienced the same thingp  pAs a workaround, is there any way to automatically dismiss the ANR I know its not the answer but I cant find any options. I am on a rooted tablet I compiled the ROM and it is only for myself  no distributionp  pthanks p

Negative 33388 pTitle Conditional Validation for ViewModel Fields on ASP MVCp  pI have a question about ASP MVC validtion. Lets say that I have the follwing View Modelp  precodepublic class PersonViewModel      [Required]     public string Name get set       [Required]     public string Email get set   codepre  pAccording to this when I submit the form MVC will validate that both fields have values. However, in my website I have the situation where the Email can be turned off in a global site setting, so the model will only render the Name Textbox on the form. Now when I submit the form it still asks me for the Email field since it is indicated as Required, despite there is no way the user can fill that field now.p  pIs there a solution for this type of scenario when using ASP MVC validationsp

The object is  a complex anidations of mapvectors with classes of mapvectors. All go well on parse, I mean, I can access all functionality of context class by it wrapper CContext. My problem is that the language should first parse an initialization file and then the script, for that the object must context should stay with the data after the first initialization file to be able to correct run the script. p  pof course there is other way, I can make a temporal file, with all the script and the initialization file. But this limit or difficult the possibility of make some kind of include inside of the language. If I do it so, then I have to first read the file for includes and add all the files on one, to in the end run the real interpret. So I prefer to be able to run the parser many times if is possible. For that I need the context stay the same.p  pI dont know if this helps but well.p  pstrongUPDATE 3strongp  pI apply that was suggested, as I understand it, still the same thing.

Ive digged into opencvs code and the problem is that when creating the cropped data, opencv does not allocate a new pointer that is 4 times smaller but instead keeps the same already allocated block, advances the pointer upstream and flags the new codeimgcode variable as not continuous. Therefore my vtk image still imports data from the original uncropped Mat. I know I could import the full image to vtkImageData and then do the cropping with a vtk filter but I would prefer not to.p  pIs there a way with opencv to obtain a cropped image that is physically cropped with a newly allocated data pointerp  pThank youp

Negative 33388 pUnit tests are a great way to measure application functionality, but Im wondering has anyone used them for some preliminary performance profilingp  pWhat Im talking about is running some profiling tool as part of an automated test run, saving performance results and then comparing them to some arbitrary values so any bottlenecks would jump out.

Negative 33388 pI am validating a form which has bit complex logic. where one after another validation is done. I mean if one validation is run then next validation depends upon first validationp  pEg, there are multiple select boxes if one box has negative value then another cannot have ve value it must have negative value. and a message box is to be shown with showing the error and a message with a checkbox that says it is correct. and if it checks the box then they can enter both positive and negative value. so to do this i used a jquery modal dialogconfirm box. but like these there are multiple cases and logics. for whom i used the dialog box with a single div with id codedialogmodalcode and i passed the message dynamically with jquery. But what happened was the jquery modal dialog box only appears for the last validationp  pso i want is to break the page loading process when the dialog modal is called and only continue after any button is pressed. I have a function for the dialog modal like this...p  precodefunction dialogparam     dialogmodal.addClassparam      dialogmodal .param .dialog         resizable false,         modal true,         buttons              Yes function                  evalparamok                  this .dialogclose          ,             No function                  evalparamcancel                  this .dialog close                              codepre  pIf it is bit messy to understand than you can ask me....Its a bit complexp

Negative 33388 pIm in the process of completing a template refresh for a WordPressbased portfolio site for one of my clients. The site has a number of existing gallery pages that are being rendered with the standard WordPress gallery code. However, the drag n drop reordering feature seems not to be working for these galleries, and given that there are such a large number of images in each gallery Id like to avoid having to reupload them.p  pAccording to some answers to similar problems posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14344178howtocallwordpress35galleryimagessotheycanbereorderedherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14277794wordpress35owngallerywithincludedimagesdoesntworkherea, I think the issue may be to do with whether the images are attachments or links, and its been suggested that one solution is to use a regular expression to produce an array containing the image ids in the correct order, like sop  precodepostcontent  postgtpostcontent pregmatch[gallery.ids...], postcontent, ids arrayid  explode,, ids[1] codepre  pSolution provided by Slevinp  pHowever, at this point I get stuck, as its beyond my abilities to integrate this into the existing WordPress gallery code.

Negative 33388 pComing from Android development Im trying to imitate some of the layouts that Ive made in past applications, but now on the iPhone and iPad. Something that I use quite often in Android is layout weight. Ive done a ton of searching, reading books, blogs, and I thought something like this would be possible in iOS 6, but I havent been able to find anything. Ive also tried watching a ton of tutorials on auto layout in iOS, but I really havent found anything that accomplishes my task. This is driving me nuts. So... is there an iOS equivalent to Android layout weightsp

Negative 33388 pI am quite new to C. After searching, I did not find related questions on this problem. I want to think this problem as an architecture view. I will try to make the explanation clear P.p  pFor example, I have two FORMsmain FORM, camera setting FORM and one classclass Camera.  When the application starts, main FORM will show up first. p  pMain FORM needs to communicate with camera. The setting FORM is generated by clicking a button on main form. Setting FORM needs to communicate with camera as well.p  pMy question is, for setting FORM to communicate with camera, is it necessary to pass the return value first to main FORM And then main FORM will communicate with the camerap  pIf so, it will be very complicated when there are several forms and several classes. If not, could I have a broad picture on what should be done Such as delegate or threads or whatp

Negative 33388 pI have an iOS application where I am using Core Data for storage. I have two entities MyEntity, and OtherEntity which are in a one to one relationship.  Both entities are related to each other i.e. each entity has an inverse relationship with the other.

The problem I am having is that I realize that I shouldnt have an attribute that is the foreign key of another entity, when the entities have a relationship with each other, however I am unable to retrieve the primary key indirectly by referencing the relationship attribute, but I am able to retrieve it by referencing the attribute that I explicitly set to the primary key of the other entityp  precodeNSInteger userId  [testUser.otherEntity.userId integerValue] gt returns nil   NSInteger userId  [testUser.userId integerValue] gt works fine codepre  pwhere testUser is an instance of type MyEntity which is a subclass of NSManagedObject, and otherEntity is an instance of the Entity, OtherEntity that has an inverse relationship with MyEntity.p  pHere are the attributes of each Entityp  precodeimport ltFoundationFoundation.hgt import ltCoreDataCoreData.hgt  class OtherEntity  interface MyEntity  NSManagedObject  property nonatomic, strong NSString  email property nonatomic, strong NSNumber  primaryId primary key for MyEntity property nonatomic, strong NSString  metaData property nonatomic, strong NSDate  birthDate property nonatomic, strong NSString  name property nonatomic, strong NSNumber  userId this is the primary key for OtherEntity property nonatomic, strong OtherEntity otherEntity  end codepre  pand here are the attributes for OtherEntityp  precodeimport ltFoundationFoundation.hgt import ltCoreDataCoreData.hgt  class MyEntity  interface OtherEntity  NSManagedObject  property nonatomic, strong NSString  address property nonatomic, strong NSString  city property nonatomic, strong NSString  country property nonatomic, strong NSString  fax property nonatomic, strong NSString  phone property nonatomic, strong NSString  postalCode property nonatomic, strong NSString  province property nonatomic, strong NSNumber  myUserIdprimary key of MyEntity property nonatomic, strong NSNumber  userIdprimary key of Other Entity property nonatomic, strong MyEntity myEntity  end codepre  pCan anyone explain to me what the problem is, or what it is that Im doing wrongp  pThanks in advance to all who reply.p

Negative 33388 pApologies for the vague title  I cant think of a way to sum this problem up succinctly.p  pHeres the deal.

Find all entries in the question table, where question.surveyId  surveyId. 2. For each row in the question table returned by the previous query     a Find all entries in the answer table, where answer.questionId  question.id     b For each row in the answer table returned by the previous query        i Find the count of all entries in the vote table where vote.answerId  answer.id codepre  pThe controller needs to return an object containing the count of the number of times there is an entry in the vote table for each answerId. It would look something like code19, 221, 30code, where 1, 2, 3 are answer IDs and 9, 21, and 0 are counts of the number of rows with that answer ID in the vote table.p  pIve been using the Q library to avoid really deeply nested callbacks. I have a runQuery utility method that returns a promise and resolves it when the database IO is finished.p  pRight now, I have something that looks likep  precoderunQueryfind questions with surveyid matching given surveyid .then     for each question row returned by query          runQueryfind answers with questionid matching this question row          .then              for each answer row returned by query              runQueryfind votes with answerID matching this answer row              .then                  for each vote row                       increment the count for this answerid in the return object                              codepre  pThe problem is, the return object is always empty when the controller returns, because there hasnt been enough time for all the database ops to finish and the promises to resolve at least, I think thats the issue  its obviously really difficult to troubleshoot things like these asynchronous promises.p  pIs there a better way of doing this Should I just give up on Q and deal with a bunch of nested callbacksp

Negative 33388 pAccording to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma94103551494454this answera I try to create a page where if the input field get focused than the height is scaled down small enough that the page will be not scrollable. If the input field lose the focus than everything is made back to the original state.p  pI tried this technique without events only entering the code through the console and it worked like a charm, but after I bind these to events, everything is ruined. I realized that after I click into the input field and the binded function executes, the input field immediately lose the focus. It logs the codebindcode to the console, but doesnt codeunwrapcode and also doesnt change the codescrollLockedcodes value, so in the next click it codewrapcode the codeltdivgtcode again and there will be multiple ones.p  pMy guess for this behavior is that after the focus the DOM isnt created yet but it immediately blurs and it is executed so fast that it try to codeunwrapcode a DOM element that isnt exist yet. The only pitfall in this theory is that after the second or umpteen click there are a lot of codeheighthelpercodes but it still doesnt codeunwrapcode any of them.p  h1a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netXGRhZ relnofollowLive Demoah1  h2HTMLh2  precodeltinput typetext idsearchtextgt ltdiv idspacer styleheight1500pxgtltdivgt codepre  h2JavaScriptjQueryh2  precodevar scrollLocked  false  document.onfocus, searchtext, function     if scrollLocked         scrollLocked  true         body.wrapInner             ltdiv idheighthelpergt.css                 height 300,                 overflow hidden                              document.onblur, searchtext, function     console.logblur     heighthelper.contents.unwrap     scrollLocked  false  codepre  pWhy does the input field lose the focus immediately and why the blurs function do not codeunwrapcode even after multiple clicks Is there a way to achieve what I describedp

Im having troubles with face recognition algorithm taken from openCV documentation. The algorithm itself works for me without any errors, however im an not sure that i understand its output or maybe it isnt really correct.. I am using ATampT database for training and recognizing..

Negative 33388 pI am running a delete which removes all of the duplicates within a table. A duplicate is defined as a row where the tagid, userid, and isself are all the same. My technique here is pretty standard, to preform this delete, since the tagsusers table itself needs to be referenced to know if a duplicate exists a temp table is created so that a delete can be preformed from the same table that is being referenced. The problem is that this table is about a million rows so this query takes about an hour to run. I know this is related to the slow speed of defining this temp table and then referencing it as it is unindexed.p  precodeDELETE FROM tagsusers WHERE id IN       SELECT id FROM          SELECT A.id FROM tagsusers as A, tagsusers as B WHERE A.id gt B.id AND A.userid  B.userid AND A.tagid  B.tagid AND A.isself  B.isself GROUP BY A.id       tempdupdelete  codepre  pI have reviewed the explain from this query listed here Please note Im on mysql 5.5 so Im using EXPLAIN SELECT 1 to simulate EXPLAIN DELETE. I think the best possible solution to this is to define an index on the temp table, but I cannot figure out how to do this yet. The crux of my question here is is there a way to improve the speed of this query considering the way it defines a temp table.

Negative 33388 pIve read somewhere in the comments section of one of the questions here in stack overflow thatp  pAlways start coding unoptimized. If it meets the requirements then its good, else code an optimized version. Check if the optimized code meets the requirements, if it meets the requirement, keep it but also keep the unoptimized version or paste the unoptimized version as a comment. if the optimized version doesnt meet the requirements, delete it and stick with the unoptimized.p  pIs there a term for this kind of programming Is this a good or bad programming practicep  pIs optimization dangerous The only reason I can think of is that it can create unnecessary complexity which can lead to errors.

Negative 33388 pIm trying to automate a scenario where Im mousing over one element and then clicking another element from that submenu. Im using CSS selectors and doing testing for IE webdriver.p  pOur soft is providing 4 different languages to navigate. My code works for all 3, except for 1.

Negative 33388 pI am making a quiz with 4 questions and 2 answers per question. I used a couple of views in the same layout so I do not create an activity for every question.  The user will see a screen with a question and 2 possible answers, than he is supposed to choose one and click next to go to the next question. How can I register a number value for each button the user chooses, and at the end, when the result button is clicked, calculate the sum of this values and display a viewfrom a multitude of 16 that is a number equal to the sum of the answersp  precode     package com.example.quizapp       import android.os.Bundle      import android.app.Activity      import android.view.Menu      import

Negative 33388 pLong story short, I have to inform a 3rd party Web Service that follows a weird business logic,  when a user logs in and out, in my J2ee Portal. So Im following her httpSession startendtimeoutp  pBut its possible for a user to create multiple httpSessions, e.g by opening multiple browsers. In this case, when an httpSession ends, either by timing out or from a logout, if I inform the 3rd party service, it will invalidate some Objects, and cause problems to the rest of the living httpSessions. p  pI can think of many ways to deal with that, like p  ol liPreventing multiple httpSessions per user, extending the login Process.li liCounting stacklogic the users httpSessions, and inform the 3rd party Service, only when the last HttpSession Ends and the 1st hhtpSession Startsli liJust provide the user with an error message that shes not supposed to use multiple browsers, and force to repeat login.li liTell the 3rd party Developers to deal with that on their side. After all I shouldnt be burdened from their awkward business logic.li ol  pBut Im getting the feeling that Im reinventing the wheel here, and Im missing an obviously better and widely adopted practicep  pWhat do you think would be the most convenient way to handle multiple simultaneous httpSessionsp
Negative 33388 pIm working on an app where the user is expected to rapidly touch and swipe across multiple UIViews, each of which is supposed to do an action once the users finger has reached it. Ive got ema lotem of views and so the typical thing to do, where Id iterate over each view to see if a touch is inside of its bounds, is a nogo  theres just too much lag. Is there any other way to get touch events from one view to another that is beside the first one I thought maybe there is some way to cancel the touch event, but Ive searched and so far have come up empty.p  pOne of the big problems I have is that if I implement my touch handling in my view controller, touchesBegan only fires for the first touch  if the user touches something and then, without moving the first finger, taps on something else, that tap is not recorded in either touchesBegan or touchesMoved. But if I implement my touch handling in the UIViews themselves, once a view registers a touch, if the user does not lift their finger up and moves it, the views around the first view do not register the touch. Only if the user lifts his finger and then puts it back down will the surrounding views register the touch.p  pSo my question is, lets say I have two views side by side, my touch handling code is implemented in the views, and I put my finger down on view 1. I then slide my finger over to view 2  what do I need to do to make view 2 register that touch, which started in view 1 and never endedp

Then using the sample at a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetMultiAutoCompleteTextView.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetMultiAutoCompleteTextView.htmla I will bound my MultiAutoCompleteTextView to the adapter. At this point, I am not sure how to convert the adapter to match my needs i.e. search contacts by name or phone and to retrieve the numbers.

Except, the data I get is not the nice formatted elements that you see in the gmail codeEditTextcode. So back to the original question how is Google doing it I dont want to spend time explaining how the gmail compose editText looks as the relevant reader can readily verify this. In their codeEditTextcode I can enter four contacts and then with random access click on one to delete it. I want to be able to do that. Howp
Negative 33388 pThe issue I am having is that text in a UITextField disappears every other keyboard tap on iOS. This issue has happened in multiple view controllers, but previously I have been able to resolve the issue by making the textfield taller, giving it more room to draw the text inside. p  pThat solution is not working for this particular situation. I am using a custom font for my app, so I have used a subclass of UITextField for the text fields that automatically sets the custom font. I have tried reverting back to the basic UITextField, but this does not solve the problem.p  pI have also tried commenting out the delegate methods Ive implemented in the problem view controller and this does not solve my issue. I dont really know what else to try, so Im hoping someone else here can point me in the right direction. Here are the things Ive discovered about my problem so farp  ol liThe text disappears and reappears with every key tap, though tapping the backspace button does not change the appearancedisappearance of the text i.e. if tapping backspace when the text is visible, text is deleted normally. If tapping while the text is hidden, characters are deleted from the textfields text, but the user cant see whats happeningli liText appears at the bottom of the textfield when it is visible and the textfield is the first responderli liWhen a different text field becomes first responder, the text in the problematic text field will be drawn properly, centered vertically in the textfield, and always visible.li liMaking a textfield first responder when it has text in it already will cause the text to redraw and appear as if it is scrolling updown within the textfield. The text will alternately be drawn centered in the textfield and scroll down out of view, or be drawn out of view and scroll up into view, resting at the bottom of the textfield.li liThe view controller only has problems in one of the two modes it is presented in. It is either presented modally as the root view controller of a UINavigationController, or it is pushed onto a modallypresented UINavigationControllers stack as the navigation controllers third view controller. In the first case, where it is the root view controller, the textfields work perfectly fine and exhibit none of the strange behavior described above. The strange behavior occurs consistently in the second case.li ol  pA good example of this problem can be seen in the video posted in this similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19352663uitextfieldtextdisappearsoneveryotherkeystrokeUITextField text disappears on every other keystrokea. The answers to the question itself are not useful and do not solve my problems.p  h2EDITh2  pIve been successful in reproducing the issue that I was having before. It turns out that the issue was caused by adding a subview to the navigation controllers view, then removing it while a UITextField was in focus. If the subview is removed while the UITextField is not being edited, the bug will not occur.p  pIn my case, a loading image was added as a subview to the navigation controller during a net call, and removed after the completion of said call. During this time, a UITextField would be active, which would cause the visual bug I describe above. p  pIve recreated the bug in a standalone example project Ive uploaded here a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comss4kc05vg1pwteeoFunky20TextField20Tester.ziphttpswww.dropbox.comss4kc05vg1pwteeoFunky20TextField20Tester.zipa. Also note that if you tell the textField to become first responder in the viewDidLoad implementation for the view controller, this bug will occur right at the beginning and persist.p  h2NEW QUESTIONh2  pIts easy enough for me to just avoid putting the loading view in the navigation controllers view, but doing so gives me a nice effect of having the loading view float in the same position on the screen, whereas putting it into a view controllers view on a nav stack raises a bunch of visual issues moving loading view position when view controller is pushed onto stack, loading view is obscured by other view controllers, etc.. p  pIs there any way to reproduce this kind of look without putting the view into the navigation controllers view, or perhaps a safe way to put it into the navigation controllers view without performing strange workarounds like stopping editing on all UITextFields in the duration of the subviews presentationp

The style looks like thisp  precodelt  chartingPieDataPoint  gt ltStyle xKeyPieDataPointStyle TargetTypechartingPieDataPointgt   ltSetter PropertyBackground ValueOrange gt   ltSetter PropertyBorderBrush ValueWhite gt   ltSetter PropertyBorderThickness Value0 gt   ltSetter PropertyIsTabStop ValueFalse gt   ltSetter PropertyRatioStringFormat Value0p2 gt   ltSetter PropertyTemplategt      ltSetter.Valuegt         ltControlTemplate TargetTypechartingPieDataPointgt            ltGrid xNameRoot Opacity1gt               ltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt                  ltVisualStateGroup xNameCommonStatesgt                     ltVisualStateGroup.Transitionsgt                        ltVisualTransition GeneratedDuration000.1 gt                     ltVisualStateGroup.Transitionsgt                     ltVisualState xNameNormal gt                     ltVisualState xNameMouseOvergt                        ltStoryboardgt                           ltDoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetNameMouseOverHighlight Storyboard.TargetPropertyOpacity To0.6 Duration0 gt                        ltStoryboardgt                     ltVisualStategt                  ltVisualStateGroupgt                  ltVisualStateGroup xNameSelectionStatesgt                     ltVisualStateGroup.Transitionsgt                        ltVisualTransition GeneratedDuration000.1 gt                     ltVisualStateGroup.Transitionsgt                     ltVisualState xNameUnselected gt                     ltVisualState xNameSelectedgt                        ltStoryboardgt                           ltDoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetNameSelectionHighlight Storyboard.TargetPropertyOpacity To0.6 Duration0 gt                        ltStoryboardgt                     ltVisualStategt                  ltVisualStateGroupgt                  ltVisualStateGroup xNameRevealStatesgt                     ltVisualStateGroup.Transitionsgt                        ltVisualTransition GeneratedDuration000.5 gt                     ltVisualStateGroup.Transitionsgt                     ltVisualState xNameShowngt                        ltStoryboardgt                           ltDoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetNameRoot Storyboard.TargetPropertyOpacity To1 Duration0 gt                        ltStoryboardgt                     ltVisualStategt                     ltVisualState xNameHiddengt                        ltStoryboardgt                           ltDoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetNameRoot Storyboard.TargetPropertyOpacity To0 Duration0 gt                        ltStoryboardgt                     ltVisualStategt                  ltVisualStateGroupgt               ltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt               ltPath xNameSlice DataTemplateBinding Geometry                      FillTemplateBinding Background                      StrokeTemplateBinding BorderBrush                      StrokeMiterLimit1gt                  ltToolTipService.ToolTipgt                     ltStackPanelgt                        ltContentControl ContentTemplateBinding FormattedIndependentValue gt                        ltContentControl ContentTemplateBinding FormattedDependentValue gt                        ltContentControl ContentTemplateBinding FormattedRatio gt                     ltStackPanelgt                  ltToolTipService.ToolTipgt               ltPathgt               ltPath xNameSelectionHighlight DataTemplateBinding GeometrySelection FillRed StrokeMiterLimit1 IsHitTestVisibleFalse Opacity0 gt               ltPath xNameMouseOverHighlight DataTemplateBinding GeometryHighlight FillWhite StrokeMiterLimit1 IsHitTestVisibleFalse Opacity0 gt            ltGridgt         ltControlTemplategt      ltSetter.Valuegt    ltSettergt ltStylegt codepre  pI then use this to define a palette for the chart.p  precodeltdatavisResourceDictionaryCollection xKeyChartPalletegt   lt blue gt   ltResourceDictionarygt      ltStyle xKeyDataPointStyle TargetTypechartingPieDataPoint BasedOnStaticResource PieDataPointStylegt         ltSetter PropertyBackground Value007d9dgt      ltStylegt   ltResourceDictionarygt   lt green gt   ltResourceDictionarygt      ltStyle xKeyDataPointStyle TargetTypechartingPieDataPoint BasedOnStaticResource PieDataPointStylegt         ltSetter PropertyBackground Value8fcd3egt      ltStylegt   ltResourceDictionarygt   lt more resource dictionaries to a total of 15 gt ltdatavisResourceDictionaryCollection xKeyChartPalettegt codepre  pThis palette I set to the codePieSeriescode.p  precodevar series  new PieSeries series.Palette  Resources[ChartPalette] as ResourceDictionaryCollection codepre  pThe colors from the palette are used correctly for the slices, the tooltip shows correctly, but the visual states do not change when I hover the mouse or click on the data points slices.

Negative 33388 pIm currently developing a 3D viewer application in WPF, and for ergonomy reasons I want my mouse to go to the other border of the screen if it goes into one.p  pFor example, if my mouse goes into the top screen border, set I set my mouse position to the bottom of my screen. Same for leftright.p  pHow can I actually detect my mouse position in WPF The only position I can get is related to the software and not the entire screen.p  pAlso, it would be great if it could support dual monitors. So the mouse is reset only if it goes into the second monitorp

Negative 33388 pI have a JSP page which contains three sections header,body and footer. I am loading header and footer sections with jsps at runtime using JQuery syntax and body section contains some imagesdata displayed. p  pNow the problem I am facing is that, while running the application in browser, header page contains so many images which are being triggered from some locations due to that when ever I open this page in browser, first body section is getting diaplyed and then header content in being loaded. This is not I expect as I want all the page display at once.p  pI want to display all the sections at one time. Is there any way to tell browser to display content at once using JavascriptJQuery. I tried using codedocument.readycode in JQuery as well as codewindow.loadcode in javascript. None of them are working.p  pI am loading headerfooter jsps as belowp  precodejQueryheader.loadheader.jsp jQueryfooter.loadfooter.jsp codepre  pstrongProblem How to make sure browser displays all the page at once instead of displaying each section slowly.strong To put simple, I feel browser works loading web page in topbottom approach. So when the browser sees tag to load header.jsp it should load header page first and them move on to body followed by footer.But in my case it is loading body first as it is having less content and then slowly loading header.p  pPLease let me know if you need any further more details and provide me with any solution for this issue.p

Now, of course, a H2443 hint is perhaps not the most troubling of hints, but Id still like to get rid of it.p  pFortunately, had it been our own code, a H2443 is trivial to fix just add the reference it is asking for.  But even though we have access to the third party source code in this scenario, it feels eminappropriateem to suddenly alter it.p  pSo I wonder Should I just wait for the developers of FastReport to release a new version without the error or should I fix it myself and then simply overwrite my copy of the source files when a new version is releasedp  pI suppose this question could technically be generalised to how to deal with hintswarnings in third party libraries.  I thought about notifying the developers, but this isnt an open sourcefree software project, so the fix wont be for months.p  pIn fairness, I should mention, that there used to be far more hints in previous versions, so at least there are steps in the right direction.p

Both of map, flatmap need a parameter, I remember a parameter is a contravariance position, I just doenst understand why map works while flatmap not.p  precodeobject test    import scala.Optiongt,Eithergt,   sealed trait Either[E,A]     def map[B]fAgtBEither[E,B] this match        case LeftegtLefte       case RightagtRightfa          def flatMap[B]f AgtEither[E,B]Either[E,B]  this match        case LeftegtLefte       case Rightagtfa                  case class Right[A]aA extends Either[Nothing,A]   case class Left[E]eE extends Either[E,Nothing]   codepre
Negative 33388 pI think I already know the answer to this, but its important so I need to be sure.  Maybe theres some trick.p  pIt is possible to run the bundle org.eclipse.ocl3.3.0 in an Apache Felix containerp  pThe bundle in question depends on org.eclipse.runtime, and org.eclipse.osgi. p  pDeploy the above to Felix and nothing works.  Deploy them to equinox and all is well, but then other bundles break.  This has been a nasty surprise. I have a feeling Im screwed and on the verge of regretting I ever took a step down the OSGi path.  But I though Id ask this good community in a last ditch effort.p  pThanksp
Negative 33388 pIm working on a windowsunix multithreaded server application network layer with Berkeley sockets and stumbled upon a problem p  ul liI have one thread waiting at select with given fd sets. li liFrom another thread, I need to add a socket to one of the fd sets. li liAs the select is currently pending, it cannot be done and leads to a starvation.li ul  pPossible solution is to add a timeout to the select. I have seen that on sites addressing networking with select dated 15 years back.  p  pThe question isbr Are there any other solutions Waiting for timeout still leads to some level of starvation and takes CPU time from the selectwaiter thread. I thought it would be possible to redesign the application but adding sockets is also done from threads that selectwaiter thread has and most definitely should have no idea about, so the condition cannot be avoided.  p  pIf not, what sort of timeout should be chosen to achieve best performance  service qualityp  pAlso note that I do realize that it would be better idea to use more advanced API iocp, kqueue, ... or a lib that would do it for me, but that is not an option for me at the given point.  p  pThanksp

Negative 33388 pIm implementing a multiplayer option for a chess game I made, but Im starting from zero to do both client and server. A friend said to me to make the game happen in the server, and the client only gets the data and shows in the GUI. Does this means that I have to implement the game in the server without GUI and in the client project, just the GUI, actionListeners and stuff, so that, for example, when I click on a piece and then click where I want it to go, the server will make the move set new position etc and then send this information back to the client so that it can print Is this the best approachp  pBy the way, my server can emwillem host several games each time 2 sockets connect it creates a game thread. Oh and also, after finishing the game, I want to implement a little chat ingame. Dont know if this information changes something...p

Negative 33388 pMy ASP.Net 4 web app calls some code that spawns a Process for a long running script. The standard output is read and the returned value is updated in the database.  I would like to fire and forget this bit of code so that my UI remains responsive and the user doesnt have to wait around for these two operations to complete.  The end result of these two operations are not needed by the calling code so I dont think I need to await anything and I dont need any indication of success or failure.p  pIm getting confused by all of the available options.  What is the best way to code this so that these two operations are just sent off on their merry way and do their thing on their own  p

Negative 33388 pI have a Collection object returned from the DB. I want to see if there size is 0 or 0 and direct my forward accordingly.  To accomplish that I used iterator and hasNext like below,p  precodeif report.getFtRecords.iterator.hasNext                      NoRecord  true     IfNoRecord forwardName  successNoRecord  retains in the same page else forwardName  success goes to 2nd page page codepre  pIn the JSP I use the same report object and in scriptlet they are performing iterator.hasNext. This works fine for 0 records returned from DB and more than 1 record returned from DB. However if there is only one record, I use the same report object and since I do hasNext in action class and do the same in JSP, Cursor moves out of the 1st record and displays nothing in the JSP.9since the resultset has 1 record. Since its an iterator I cannot reset the collection. I cannot get the size of the collection too since my class extends abstract collection, so anything that calls .size throws exception. How do i handle the same. I tried to handle in the DB by sending last column with the count but will endup having the same issue. Any suggestionsp

Negative 33388 pI am relatively new to using Log4j and logstash. I am using Log4j with a socket appender to push log events to logstash1.4.2 and then on to Elasticsearch1.1.1 for storage. p  pI have tried generating the logging properties through an external properties file log4j.properties and through the java code. Both approaches seem to work with one exception The log events created with the properties specified in the code do not generate the stack trace information that those generated with an external properties file generate.p  pI have looked at the logstash documentation as well as the Apache Log4J docs to see if there is any reason why this may be happening but have found nothing.

Negative 33388 pIm trying to run a Python script from a WPF application, but I cant figure out how to find the file on the client machine. I know ClickOnce installs the files to AppDataLocal, but that seems like a poor way to search for the script.p  pIn my code, Im starting a shell as followsp  precodevar p  new Process p.StartInfo.FileName  CPython27python.exe p.StartInfo.Arguments  String.Format0 1, ScriptName, args p.StartInfo.WorkingDirectory  ltpathtoprojectgt p.StartInfo.WindowStyle  ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden p.StartInfo.CreateNoWindow  true p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute  false p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput  true p.Start string output  p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd p.WaitForExit codepre  pOn my development machine, the codeWorkingDirectorycode parameter makes it all work if I set it to the project path because thats where the Python script resides.p  pI included the script in the ClickOnce file manifest and Ive verified that it ends up in each version of the application deployment. Ive also verified that the file ends up on the client machine in the obfuscated hierarchy, so everything is in place except I cant get my WPF application to actually run it. I could always copy the file to a known place on the machine, but that completely defeats the point of ClickOnce.p  pAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 33388 pSo I have a mysql database in my PhpMyAdmin which stores all the information about a big list of products. The name, description, the image file name and the price. So here is the case, some products have decimal numbers in their price so I set the datatype for productprice from int to float. But some products cost for instance, 199.90, as I enter that value in the table it recieves it and stores it as 199.90 just as I want it to. But when I output the price on the website which I do with php it only outputs the number 199.9 as you can se the last zero is missing. Even though the two numbers are of the same value. 199.9 looks much less appealing  than 199.90, and I hope that is understandable. So, what am I supposed to dop  pThanks p

Negative 33388 pI am developing an ios application by using phonegap. Because it needs to implement face recognition, so I also use native language objectivec here. p  pIn main story board, I have two view controllers. One is called FaceRec, it is totally created by using objectivec. The face recognition functionality is implemented here. The other one is phonegap main view controller. They are connected by using Tab Bar Controller. p  pThe problem is when user enter FaceRec page from Tab Bar Controller and get response from server. If the response is true, I dont know how to send that response from FaceRec to phonegap main view controller. Because they are in different view controller and I also dont know how to call javascript function from objectivec. p  pI know by using plugin I can call objectivec method from javascript and also get response, but what I want is to send data from objectivec to phonegap through different view controller and call a javascript function.p  pDoes anyway has any ideas Thanks in advancep  pHere is the code in index.htmlp  precode    ltscript typetextjavascriptgt      function login              function                        .mobile.navigate main,  transition  slide, info info about the bar hash                       ltscriptgt    ltdiv idloginPage datarolepage datathemebgt  ltdiv idmain datarolepage datathemebgt codepre
Negative 33388 pIm working on a web application that requires a manifest file. There is an issue that causes the chrome browser to hang. This issue only happens in this scenariop  ol liI go to the index.html page and let chrome fetch the manifest filesli liI update the manifest header manually and refresh the page to force chrome to get it againli liChrome starts getting files but hangs after a whileli ol  pI thought my issue might be related to manifest but its funny that if I go to chromeappcacheinternals and remove the manifest file from there, the app will be booted without any problem. Is there any differences between these 2 way of forcing chrome to get manifest  maybe it can give me some hints to find my problem. By the way, not only that tab but also the developer tools on that tabs hangs, so I wont be able to use it.p

Negative 33388 pOk, so i am quite new to JavaScript, and may not know what i am doing wrong, so i need help correcting any mistakes ive made.  My aim to to make a title, and a sentence with 2 buttons.  One button is supposed to change the text of the sentence, and the other to change the text of the title.p  pHeres my thoughts  I named the functions title and sentence If i did it right so when i click the button that is said to execute that command on click, it does. obviously  So like onclicktitle  I mean when you click that button, it runs the code that would change the title, and vice versa for the sentence.  All i end up getting when i open it is 2 buttons, a sentence, and a title.  I click the buttons, nothing happens.  So my question is  How do i make 2 buttons that change 2 different entities.  One to change title, one to change the sentence.

Negative 33388 pDo you know a way in uirouter to get the list of child states of a given statep  pIm implementing a complex SPA with maybe 4 level deep navigation using uirouter. p  pI would like to implement a navigation tab interface for the second level generated automatically from the router table. p  pFor that, I need to get the list of direct children of a given state maybe is an abstract state. The only way that Ive found to get the states is to do a codestate.getcode and obtain the full list of states, but that means that Ill have to parse child states on my own, and I think thats code already written in uirouter.p  pI let this question here in case theres anyone with experience in the source code or know of a plugin or module that can help me on this. Meanwhile I will do a research on my own and post results if I find something.p

Negative 33388 pI have an application that uses a lot of memory diffing the contents of two potentially huge 100k directories. It makes sense to me that such an operation would use a lot of memory, but once my diffing operation is done, the heap remains the same size.p  pI basically have code that instantiates a class to store the filename, file size, path, and modification date for each file on the source and target. I save the additions, deletions, and updates in other arrays. I then codeclearcode my source and target arrays which could be 100k each by now, leaving relatively small additions, deletions, and updates arrays left.p  pAfter I codeclearcode my target and source arrays though, the memory usage as visible via VirtualVM and Windows Task Manager doesnt drop. Im not experienced enough with VirtualVM or any profiler for that matter to figure out what is taking up all this memory. VirtualVMs heap dump lists the top few objects with a retained size of a few megabytes.p  pAnything to help point me in the right directionp

Negative 33388 pI have questions upon using the new ASP.Net OpenID Connect framework while adding new Claims during the authentication pipeline as shown in the code below.

Should I be manually setting codeHttpContext.Current.Usercode and codeThread.CurrentPrincipalcode from codeOwinContext.Authentication.Usercodep  pQ2.

Negative 33388 pIm using html frames, splitting the page into 4 parts. The top left part is used to show several database fact tables, organized in a RadioButton group, allowing the user to specify the table which hes interested in. Upon selection, dimension tables linked to the selected table are displayed in the bottom left frame. The function of the remaining two tables is not important right now.p  pI have a servlet tending to each frame, and have managed to get the first frame up and running. What I would like to do now is to call the second servlet each time a new RadioButton is clicked and have it update its frame. I tried the onClick approach with no success, and resorting to forms in order to allow updates via submit buttons seems a bit lackluster. p  pIn short, Id like to call another servlet each time a new RadioButton selection is made in the browser.  p  pUpdate Heres the current solution.p  precodelt page sessiontrue contentTypetexthtml charsetUTF8 pageEncodingUTF8gt lt taglib urihttpjava.sun.comjspjstlcore prefixcgt  ltheadgt lttitlegtTitlelttitlegt ltheadgt  ltbodygt ltform nameform methodPOST actionDZ4dimensionsAndMeasures targetdimAndMesgt ltolgt     ltcforEach vartable itemsfactTablesgt         ltligtltinput typeradio namefactTable valuetable.id onclickthis.form.submitgttable.nameltligt     ltcforEachgt ltolgt ltformgt ltbodygt codepre

Negative 33388 pCurrently we are building an app which does something and before doing something it always validates the  token send by the client by calling a different service i.e. authentication service. Now we are planing to use varnish reverse proxy. Even though we use varnish, it needs to call the authentication service to authenticate the token it takes nearly 100 milisec to validate a token before even returning the response.p  pSo my question is is it proper to use varnish for this use case. Because varnish suppose to return the cached response blazingly fast manner if i tell varnish to call to authentication service to authenticate the token than it may not be proper. What you guys think about it Thanks in advance.p

Negative 33388 pSo I basically have an extremely long list of strings, and a CSV file that contains a column of strings and a column of numbers.  I need to loop through the extremely long list of strings, and for each one, loop through the rows of the CSV file checking each string in the first column of the CSV to see if it occurs in my string, and if it does, add the number in the other column to something.  A minimal sort of example would be p  precodeimport csv sList  [a cat, great wall, mediocre wall] vals  [] with openfile.csv, r as f     r  csv.readerf     for w in sList         val  0         for row in r             if row[0] in w                 val  1         vals.appendval codepre  pAn example of a CSV file with which I might use this could bep  precodea, 1 great, 2 codepre  pOf course csv.readerf creates an iterable that I can loop through only once.  Ive seen recommendations elsewhere to use itertools but all of the recommendations Ive found have been for problems that involve looping through the CSV file a small number of times, usually just twice.  If I tried to use this to loop through the CSV many times Im unsure of what that would mean for memory consumption, and in general Im just wondering about the smartest way to approach this problem.p

I can see the movie from my player by accessing that file without any problems at all.p  h2THE PROBLEMh2  pThe problem is in the shutdown function. You may ask why i want to use posixkill and kill the php pid.p  pUser has the option to select multiple movies to see from my application. A user has LIMIT to connections that can be opened to my server. That means if a user has 1 available slots to connect to the server he will be able to open only one movie at once.p  pFor that reason, lets say that a user is currently watching a Movie and he wants to ZAP change the current movie to another one. p  pHe wont be able to do that, because the old connection will not be ended fast and the pid will remain open for some seconds more.p  h2POSIXKILL Explanationh2  pstrongIf we uncomment the posixkill linestrong of the above code the user strongwont be able to see any moviestrong at all because somehow the posixkill function override all the above headers and the nginxphp does not send the headers i have in the file.p  pstrongHowever, if i DISABLE the HTTP SEEK and enable the posixkill as explained, user will be able to watch movies BUT he wont be able to seekstrong . This is happening because when we have the AcceptRanges header, players are doing multiple requests to the movie before opening it.p  pSo for example, a player will do 23 requests to that PHP File to understand and identify the seek. Posixkill however will kill those pids fast, and the player wont be able to take the right headers.p  h2What we wanth2  pSo, we want a solution that will make the PID of the connection in the server to be dropped instantly when the user closes the connection but remain the seek support.p  pemPS. The above code with posixkill enabled works PERFECTLY on live streaming as we dont have seek so a player will only make one request.emp  pHope you understand me Thank youp

Negative 33388 pI have a controller with a PUT method which accepts a set of parameters via JSON and then updates the database.

Am I missing something or is this just the way PUT worksp  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI thought about doing a LINQ select against the DB and then doing a check on each variable amp if its null then setting it to the data it got from the select, however this wont work as if the value actually comes through as null from the user it will leave the DB value in tact. This will work if there is a way I can determine if its missing from the JSON call rather than if its null, but it seems pretty inefficient.p

Negative 33388 pSo im working on a project for school, in which I have created a database with the information for all the chemicals on the periodic table, and upon running the program, the user is prompted to pick between a few options, such as search, sort, etc. Like thisp  precode String[] options  new String[] Search, Sort, Add, Delete, Exit     int xJOptionPane.showOptionDialognull, Choose one of the following, Virtual Periodic        Table, JOptionPane.DEFAULTOPTION, JOptionPane.PLAINMESSAGE,             null, options, options[0]      while true              if options[x]Search                                                  searchMenu                     else if options[x]Sort                             else if options[x]Add                             else if options[x]Delete                             else if options[x]Exit                      break               codepre  pI am not quite finished, as of right now I am still working on the search option. Anyways, upon clicking the search option, I call a procedure which pops up another menu which prompts the user to specify what they would like to search by, like thisp  precode String[] options  new String[] Name, Symbol, Atomic Number, Atomic Mass,  of Valence     Electrons, Go Back     int xJOptionPane.showOptionDialognull, What would you like to search by, Virtual  Periodic Table, JOptionPane.DEFAULTOPTION, JOptionPane.PLAINMESSAGE,             null, options, options[0]      if options[x]Name                                          searchByName           else if options[x]Symbol                 else if options[x]Atomic Number                 else if options[x]Atomic Mass                 else if options[x] of Valence Electrons                      else if options[x]Go Back            codepre  pNow, I am trying to figure out a way in which I can give the user the option to go back to the main menu so they can do something else with the data. For example if i decide to search but then i decide i want to actually sort, I can simply press Go Back and it will popup the previous menu, which was the main menu, so I can choose what I want to do next. I have added the button which says Go Back but im not quite sure how to make it so it actually gives command back to the main method which can popup the main menu again. I tried to put the search menu in a while loop and then making it break out of the loop if they were to click Go Back but it didnt no anything but close the entire program.p  pIm still fairly new to GUI in Java, anybody know what i can do p

Negative 33388 pI have a multisided div that is being controlled by angular and a piece of json, and what I am trying to do is have different nvd3 graphs on each side. So right now, I have all the graphs working on each side however the ones that arent shown  initially seem to collapse to a minimum width, so when I show them they have like 15px width. I have a json object with sides with a key value of active boolean and this determines what is shown through angular by a simple this is in an ngrepeat p  precode ltdiv ngshowside.active gt codepre  pSo I have logic that switches sides, and this works fine, however it looks like when the item is not shown it just collapses the graph.p  pWhat I did notice is if you resize the window it will refresh the charts perfectly to the right size.

Thanks for readingp  pEdit I figuired out I can do something simply with jquery like p  precode  nv.utils.windowResizechart.update  .flipWidgRight.bind click, function    chart.update  .flipWidgLeft.bind click, function    chart.update   codepre  pthis is inside the nv.addGraph, but Im wondering if there is a better way of going this that is a little more polymorphic, becuase id have to place these bindings inside each nv.addGraphp

Negative 33388 pArchitectural question. As part of a game, we were looking at keeping track of number of items that have been completed across all players. No problem keeping track of a players status, dynamo shards nicely across the users. But if I want a single number that shows how many of X have been processed, then Im talking about a single row table, which means everyone who is updated and retrieving from that table is hitting on exactly the same row. Im pretty sure Dynamo will take a lot of this, but Im wondering how well it will scale. As each person performs a function, the counter would increment, and then they would read it back.p  pIm thinking we could keep the counter in memcache or Redis, and update it when a new item is classified, and rebuild it on a nightly basis. This seems like overkill, and requires extra infrastructure.p  pAny thoughts Has anyone done this successfully Dynamo keeps track, but the number they return can be six hours out of date.p

Negative 33388 pWe have a web application that makes use of the Gmail API to automate certain emails on our users behalf. When the application sends an email, it stores the threadId returned by the Gmail API. It then uses this threadId to poll the Gmail users.threads.get API, looking for replies. When a reply is detected, it pauses future emails.p  pThe vast majority of the time, this works. However, we sometimes get complaints from users that their emails were not paused even though they received a reply. We recently confirmed with a user that the Gmail interface showed him a reply to an email our application had sent on his behalf. The Gmail interface showed this reply in the same thread as our original, outgoing email. However, when we repeat the users.threads.get call with the threadId we have for the email we sent, the Gmail API includes only the outgoing email in the thread ie thread.messages.length  1.p  pIs this a known limitation of the Gmail API Is there a workaround to ensure that we can see emails that the Gmail interface displays as a thread I understand that there may be situations in which a reply does not get grouped with the original, outgoing email eg when the recipient changes the subject prior to replying. The difficulty is that the user sees the original, outgoing email grouped with a reply that we cant detect.p

Negative 33388 pBesides stronge references, there are three distinct kinds of Reference WeakReference, SoftReference and PhantomReference. There may be others, but they will either extend one those or be irrelevant to my question.p  pIf an object is not strongly reachable during a GC cycle, it gets garbage collected i.e. finalized and removed from memory. But before it is collected, any Reference is cleared  depending on reachability conditions, the kind of Reference to be cleared, memory demand, etc.p  pI was wondering, if the JLS made any guarantees about whether all References of the same kind to the same object are cleared atomicallysimultaneously, or if there is a slight chance ie. race condition, that some References get cleared while other References of the same kind are not, such that an object could potentially be revived ie. be strongly referenced again through one of the remaining References although some References of the same kind have already been cleared and enqueued.p  pQuestion rephrased from a different POV Is it safe to assume that a cleared Reference implies that the previously referenced object cannot be revived through a different Reference of the same kindp

Negative 33388 pI work with data where most header name that are very long strings. These are cryptic but contain important details that cannot be forgotten. Long column names are difficult to work with for various display reasons as well as programmatic ones. To help with this, I typically retain the original column names as Hmisc labels amp rename the columns with uninformative names like V1, V2, V3... etc or with some truncated but still long amp often not unique version of the long name.p  precodelibraryHmisc myDF lt read.csvsomeFile.csv myLabels lt colnamesmyDF labelmyDF, selfFALSE lt myLabels colnamesmyDF lt paste0V, 1ncolmyDF codepre  pI can now work with the short names V amp still look up the labels to get the original names. However, this is still less than satisfactory... myDF is now composed of class labelled and contains character vectors although my data is numeric in nature. Converting to numeric or even subsetting myDF will cause the labels to be dropped. Does anyone have some better suggestions In particular I need to subset data, amp I also find indexing by number to be clumsy amp error prone. p  pDue to large data relative to RAM, I cannot keep copies of both numeric amp labelled data.frames. I have also tried creating hash objects using the hash packagep  precodelibraryhash myHash lt hashcolnamesmyDF, labelmyDF codepre  pOr via listsp  precodenameList lt list forname in colnamesmyDF    nameList[[name]] lt labelmyDF[name]  codepre  pBut... I also find these unsatisfactory mostly because they can fall out of synch with myDF after various manipulations amp they are not accessible from the same object. Perhaps I just need to be more diligent. p  pLastly, I thought that perhaps a solution would be a custom class that contains a data.frame amp some other data structures to know the very meaningless terse name, the verbose amp nonunique nickname, amp the true variable name. But this would require overloading all the indexing operators amp is likely way over my head skill wise.p  pSo any other purposed solutions Any help appreciated. p

When the agent tries to connect to the API it throws the following errorp  pcom.ibm.jsse2.util no trusted certificate found. This all is running on a Domino 9.0.1fp3 server.

Negative 33388 pIm hoping that someone on here can shed some light on the belowp  pIm busy setting up a shared hosting server using NGINX and HHVM with PHPFPM failover.  Im planning on hosting between 100 and 200 Wordpress sites on the server.  p  pHHVM is configured to use FastCGI.  Is it possible to have a single HHVM instance running multiple websites, each as their respective Linux user  Or would my only option be to have everything running as the default wwwdata user  p  pIm hoping to avoid the latter soup kitchenesque environment due to the obvious security and crosscontamination risk it presents.  Ive seen mention made of running separate HHVM instances, one per website, but this sounds like a fairly resource intensive option.p  pIf its not possible to have one HHVM instance with FastCGI and have each websites PHP processes run as the respective Linux user, Ill probably opt to drop HHVM in favor of PHPFPM which will allow me to achieve the latter.p  pAny tips or advise would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanksp

Negative 33388 pI have an app which takes android map marker locations latlong from mysql database. And user from my app can add markers too. The problem is that when user adds location of the new marker it does not appear on map. However the lat and long values appear in mysql database and if i reinstall the app it will show added location. Issue here seems to be that i have to refresh the map and i dont know how to do it in google maps v2. I found some answers that i should clear all markers and then load them again like thisp  precodegoogleMap.clear  codepre  pBut sadly it did not work. I found that in codeversion onecode there was this method p  precodemap.invalidate codepre  pSadly in Google Maps v2 there is no such method.

Negative 33388 pI have a Facebook app that I use only for retrieving insights data on my pages programatically.

Negative 33388 pIn our system there is a Schedule table which has two parts, one is being extensively updated fields LockedBy,LockExpirationTime,NextDueTime, and second is mostly static fields like Enabled,Name,SchedulePartition. In a such configuration does it make sense to split it actually in two different tables, with one to one mappingp  pThe update stored proc competes for schedules. It modifies only those dynamic fields, but takes into consideration static fields such as enabled, currently it uses rowlock with readpast. There are other tables, which rely on static part of the table, thus there are many read queries to the static part.p

Negative 33388 pI see that there are a lot of success stories using CloudFormation, were planning to use it to make sure our ProdDev environments are identical. I heard that its a a great place to have a single file, in version control, for deploying multiple similar environments.  Ive a doubt, lets say if I use CloudFormer and create a template of say my DB instance and save it GIT, and say in next 1015 days I make couple of changes like add new volumes in instance to store DataFiles, or delete some volumes etc, Now, when I use that Template in say our Dev Environment will it reflect the volumes which I addeddeleted. I mean how does it work behind the scene. p

Negative 33388 pI am trying to implement a function in neural network. The function is calculated in following manner. p  pThe error signals are the input. There are 5 total error signals. These signals are multiplied by 5 separate gains individually.These signals are then sent through a saturation block to limit the signals. They are then added to compute an ouput value single value. p  pI have taken 1000 samples of the 5 inputs and I also have the target output samples. I have modelled a Levenberg Marquardt training algorithm. Is there a way I could use the trained weights to calculate the gains in the function.p  pI plan to train the neural network and calculate gains offline so that I can use them later.p

I have this a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comvtQaJ.jpg relnofollowimagea. There are few circles near the center. To know whether program detects them I wrote code that draws circle of detected radius and square at the center of the circle. On the image there are 2 big circles and 2 small. Theres only 1 big detected, but thats not the problem  the others handdrawn, so shape is not correctcan be corrected with GaussianBlur. My concern is that program does not detect those 2 small perfect circles. How can I fix it Thanks in advance.p

Negative 33388 pI have been reading this book on java about runtime type information and I am very confused about class objects and the class Class. The question maybe silly but I am kind of confused. When we normally write a class we use smaller case c for the word class. eg. public class Foo with the class name starting with upper case. so the class Class is upper case C for the class name. Now the confusion is about the class object. which is also upper case for that class. so now forexample if we have say a method in a class such as p  precodepublic void countClassClassltgt  type   Classltgt superClass  type.getSuperclass   public TypeCounter Classltgt baseType  this.baseType  baseType  codepre  pNow in the first method what I understand is that the method countClass of type void has an argument of any type of class object The Class referring to here is what exactly The class CLass or the Class object if it is a class object of any type why cant we just write the name of the superclass here instead of complicating things so muchp  pIn the second method there is no type stated at all for the method TypeCounter how does that work and again it has a type of Class in the argument passedp  pIf these are referring to the Class class then what does it really mean and if it is just the Class object then what does the class object really do in this case herep  pThere are classes like thisp  precodestatic class PetCounter extends LinkedHasMapltClasslt extends petgt,Integergt  .... codepre  pnow the Class is what really class Class or Class object Im sorry if I am confusing you with this question.

Hopefully it helps.p  pstrongUPDATE 08262015strongp  pI tried the other approach which is to setup the web.xml file with security constraints and removed spring security adapter reference in the pom.xml file and used keycloak core and keycloak adapter core instead. It now redirects to my Keycloak server. However, when I login using the username and password, I get redirected back to the web url but it returns an error with Http Status 403 Access to the specified resource  has been forbidden.

Negative 33388 pIm pretty new to jni.p  pI need to invoke a native method from java code, which should perform a timeconsuming operation asynchronously in another thread, and at the end it should invoke a java callback. However I need this callback to be invoked in the same java thread that originated the operation. That is, the java application should be singlethreaded, and all callbacks should be invoked in the context of this thread.p  pIve read tutorials on callback invocations, the stuff about keeping global refs to the object, getting the appropriate methodid and invoking it. Ive also found stuff about how to call a java method from another thread codeAttachCurrentThreadcode, however this is not what I need. I need to make the java call within the originating thread, so the question is how do I switch to that threadp  pFor instance, in Win32 Id use something like codePostMessagecodecodePostThreadMessagecode to invoke a code in the specified thread, assuming it runs the messageloop. Therere also alternatives like codeQueueUserAPCcode which is applicable if the thread waits for events in an alertable state.p  pSo, what are the options at my disposal Is there a jni method for posting execution of a java method in the specified thread Or perhaps a linux equivalent of codePostThreadMessagecode I can also think about workarounds within the java code, but prefer to solve this on the native side.p  pThanks in advance.p

This can be done using raw PCL command or from windows apps that print using a printer that has been configured to substitute fonts based on a font substitution table. This is configured in the printers properties.p  pQuestion We have an app that needs to print a document with secure fonts. Our app produces HTML andor PDF it does not create raw PCL. However, neither of these two formats are able to use the font substitution printing through IE, Chrome, Acrobat Reader or FoxIt. We CAN get it to work if the document in HTML is opened and printed through Word.p  pThis is leading us to the conclusion that browsers and PDF readers are not font substitution aware i.e. they cant make use of this feature.p  pHas anyone else encountered a similar issue p
Negative 33388 pOK, so Im experimenting a bit with a hrefhttpelectron.atom.io relnofollowElectrona formerlt Atom Shell and trying to see how this could work in a emrealem app.p  pNow, given that the app is going to be commercial, Ill also have to think of some license generation scheme.p  pIn the past, Ive worked with a hrefhttpwww.fastspring.com relnofollowFastSpringa for payment processing  CocoaFob for license generation and Ive lately switched to a hrefhttpwww.paddle.com relnofollowPaddlea  which admittedly works very smoothly, especially when using their SDKs  on Mac.p  pSo, Im thinking how this whole thing good be done  given that, now, the application wont just be an OS X one, but a Windows one as well. And that I wont be having full control over the app, given that the app will be pretty much only HTMLCSSJS.p  pAny ideas on how to approach this Has anyone done that successfullyp

Negative 33388 pI want to create an arbitrary canvas in Cocoa that is, a drawing area where the entire visible area can be drawn on and with scrolling limits chosen by the programmer and have no effect on whether I can draw on the entirety of the visible area. This is similar to how I would do this on Windows and GTK, and different from the standard NSScrollView in that a I draw solely in the visible area so 0, 0 is the origin of the visible area, not the whole document and b I am not restricted to the document view frame so if the document view is smaller than the visible area I can still draw everything in the visible area.p  pTo do this, Im implementing a subclass of NSClipView to do the drawing and using NSScrollViews document view solely to set scroll extents.p  pWhen I override codedrawRectcode in NSClipView, the background of the clip view turns black. The method can be empty, it can defer to codesupercode, or it can draw anything the result is the same. Only by omitting codedrawRectcode does the correct white background color draw.p  pNow, as hinted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8711499iossubviewdisplayedasablackrectangleifdrawrectisoverwrittenherea even though its about iOS I assume the models are similar enough that the solution would have worked on OS X too, if I override codeisOpaquecode to return codeNOcode, the background draws correctly. Why What is different about NSClipView that it can get away with returning codeYEScode while still drawing the backgroundp  pOr is my approach to implementing this scroll view wrongp  pThanks.p

Negative 33388 pSo I have a grid view, when a thumbnail is pressed a video is suppose to come up.  The grid view and video are each described by there own activity.

Ive searched everywhere on how to build an appropriate media player for a video, and they all say different things.

Negative 33388 pIn my current app there are quite some complex calculations to do after coderouteChangeSuccesscode before the new page is really fully shown. This causes a bit of flickering as the content changes position and size. Im already preloading the needed JSON and images before the route changes via coderesolvecode in the coderouteProvidercode. br My idea to prevent this is to stop codengViewcode from deleting the old content before the new one gets inserted. Instead I want to insert the new content with codedisplaynonecode set, so the newly compiled directives can execute their linking procedures while the old route content is still showing. After this is all finished, the old content would be deleted and the new content would be displayed which would happen instantly with no flickering.p  pIs there a way to do this I didnt find any option in the docs or in google where you could define such a behaviour. The only option I see now is a custom build of codengRoutecode where I change the codengViewFactorycode to my needs. But I dont really like that idea as this will be stressful when I want to upgrade my angular version etc. Maybe theres a better wayp

Negative 33388 pI have this weird problem, I call UIView.animateWithDuration in viewDidAppear of my apps initial View Controller, but the animation seems to jump it becomes visible somewhere halfway. The only workaround I found is to add a delay before starting the animation. Id love to understand why this happens and if theres a better solution than the delay.p  pTo try it yourself, create a single view app, then add the method below in ViewController.swift Xcode debugger slows the app a bit, to simulate real conditions, stop and launch the app from the device or simulatorp  precodeoverride func viewDidAppearanimated Bool      super.viewDidAppearanimated      let redSquare  UIViewframe CGRectMake0, 0, 50, 50     redSquare.backgroundColor  UIColor.redColor     redSquare.center  view.center      view.addSubviewredSquare      UIView.animateWithDuration0.5   gt Void in         var newFrame  redSquare.frame         newFrame.origin.y  200         redSquare.frame  newFrame       codepre  pThe red square is supposed to start translating from the center of the screen to somewhere up top, but its as if the animation starts but the app is not ready to display it yet, so you see the red square starting its translation above the center.p  pEDIT Added call to viewDidAppear in example does not solve the problem though.p

Negative 33388 pI know getting microphone input has been asked many types before, but only for iOS. The Apple docs about AVFoundation only talk about iOS, so Im not sure if its even meant to be used on a mac. I have looked at CoreAudio, and most of it is deprecated, and the only docs are in ObjectiveC. I am looking for a standardlib swift solution of getting microphone samples. Does anybody have anything or is this type of stuff just not done in swiftp
Negative 33388 pI have a universal windows store app targeting Windows 10. In a previous version of the app targeting Windows 8.1 I used the LiveSDK a hrefhttpwww.microsoft.comenusdownloaddetails.aspxid42552 relnofollowthe 5.6 version herea to access data from the users MS Live account using the codeLiveAuthClientcode. In the new version of the app, I figured Id use the most recent version of the LiveSDK a hrefhttpswww.nuget.orgpackagesLiveSDK relnofollow5.6.3 available as a nuget package herea but when I install the nuget package, I am unable to to access the Microsoft.Live namespace.p  pFor example, the following statementp  precodeusing Microsoft.Live codepre  pProduces the error codeThe type or namespace Live does not exist in the namespace Microsoftcodep  pIs this package broken or am I missing something obvious here I would have expected this to work just like it did with the 5.6 version of the LiveSDK. It also seems like the a hrefhttpsdev.onedrive.com relnofollowdocumentation for the LiveSDKa is all pointing to info about the OneDrive api now so it makes me wonder if the purpose of the sdk has changed. Im confused... Whats the most recent version of the LiveSDK the one that has the codeLiveAuthClientcode and where can I find itp
