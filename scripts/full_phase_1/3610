Positive 3610 pI use this sheet to track the location of different things based off hard input from shipping schedules. Im working with three tables  p  ol lia list of all materials three columns that matter Identifier 1, Identifier 2, and Locationli lithe shipping out of plant A Identifier 1, Identifier 2, Shipping Dateli lipthe shipping out of plant B same as the plant A table. All materials are identified by two separate columns.p  precodeABCDEFGHIJK ID1ID2LocationID1ID2Ship DateID1ID2Ship Date 1A1A291715B291515 2A2A191815B291815 3A3B291815A191915 4B1C191915B192015 5B2A392115C192215 6C1A192215C292215 7C2 codepreli ol  pThere is a lot of shipping back and fourth. So, my original plan was to have an INDEXMATCH lookup the highest date value between the two shipping tables, and return that to the location column as either Plant A if the most recent date is on the Plant B table or Plant B if the most recent date is on the Plant A table.  p  pI couldnt figure that out at all. I ended up just adding two columns that looked up the shipping date from each table, and then with the location column, I just did if this is bigger than that Plant A if false Plant B and hid the two columns that formula looked like indextable2,Matcha1ampB1,EEampFF,0,1... but then I realized that it was pulling the oldest date from the second two tables instead of the newest one... making it worthless. p  pSo, I guess my first question is how do you get an INDEXMATCH function to find the highest value   p  pAnd my second is there any way to do it how I wanted to originally I tried using multiple indexmatch functions nested in an If function but it was super messy and refused to work or should I just keep my two hidden columns set up goingp

Positive 3610 pIm having a hard time coming up with a solution so any help or ideas would be appreciated.  Below is an example of the data structure that im working with.  Long story short Im working with a webpage that is loaded near completely in javascript.  As a result im scraping data from the site using a combination of regex and selenium.  So the data that youre seeing below is a partial scrape.  If you scroll down youll see a key with the value codeSports ampampamp Fitnesscode and it has a bunch of subcategories, which are also dictionaries. One of the values that is in all the dictionaries is the key codehasmorecode.  Hasmore is a key that keeps track of whether the web element is an expandable folder with more subcategories in it.  I need to be able to tell when Ive reached the end of a branch. That is if the is there is nothing else to click hasmore is false if all the children of a particular node have been clicked and scraped I need to switch that parents hasmore key to false, so when on the next pass, selenium knows not to transverse that section.  The idea is to build a dictionary of categories and subcategories, which is why I need to keep track of the parent categories and whether or not it hasmore subcategories.  Ive tried variations of code that looks like thisp  precodedef checktreeself, d     for k, v in d.iteritems       if isinstancev, dict         self.checktreev       else   codepre  pI have no clue what to do in the else.  I do know if the codesubcatergoriescode key is an empty dictionary that I have hit the end and that should trigger some event to let the parent know that that particular branch is done.p  precodedata parsed      Apparel          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Arts ampampamp Entertainment          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Attorneys ampampamp Law Firms          clicked false,          hasmore false,          subcatergories      ,      Beauty ampampamp Personal Care          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Business ampampamp Industrial          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Computers ampampamp Consumer Electronics          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Dining ampampamp Nightlife          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Family ampampamp Community          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Finance          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Food ampampamp Groceries          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Health          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Hobbies ampampamp Leisure          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Home ampampamp Garden          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Internet          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Jobs ampampamp Education          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      News, Media ampampamp Publications          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Occasions ampampamp Gifts          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Real Estate          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Sports ampampamp Fitness          clicked true,          hasmore true,          subcatergories              Boating ampampamp Water Recreation                  clicked true,                  currentnode Boating ampampamp Water Recreation,                  hasmore false,                  parent Sports ampampamp Fitness,                  subcatergories              ,              Fitness                  clicked false,                  currentnode Fitness,                  hasmore true,                  parent Sports ampampamp Fitness,                  subcatergories              ,              Sporting Goods                  clicked false,                  currentnode Sporting Goods,                  hasmore true,                  parent Sports ampampamp Fitness,                  subcatergories              ,              Sports                  clicked false,                  currentnode Sports,                  hasmore true,                  parent Sports ampampamp Fitness,                  subcatergories              ,              Sports Fan Gear ampampamp Apparel                  clicked true,                  currentnode Sports Fan Gear ampampamp Apparel,                  hasmore false,                  parent Sports ampampamp Fitness,                  subcatergories                            ,      Telephony          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Travel ampampamp Tourism          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories      ,      Vehicles          clicked false,          hasmore true,          subcatergories        codepre

BUT, if the user digits a letter or whatever which is not a number, the ifelse loop goes crazy and the program starts printing Choose a number between 0 and 50 Please insert a number between 0 and 50, not a letter whitout stopping...

Positive 3610 pFirst off, I am having trouble describing my issue. I apologize in advanced if I am not seeing an existing answer online. How can I split this string into an array where each entry is the text within each set of square brackets. Here is the stringp  precodeplanyear[benefitgroupsattributes][0][relationshipbenefitsattributes][1][premiumpct] codepre  pWhat I need to do is store the value in second set of square brackets. In this example it is [0]. .split hasnt given me the result I wanted, and I think it is because I am doingp  precode.split[[]] codepre  pShould I expect something like this to workp

Negative 3610 pEven though I am an experienced programmer and engineer, I find that I always run into tedious problems when dealing with networks. Rarely do installations of routers etc work out of the box, and you find yourself trying to learn all kinds of acronyms like WPA, UPnP, etc, and have a hard time trying to map these with the conceptual logic of networking. I think this is particularly true of networking it is a lot easier to troubleshoot things like compiling, installing hardware peripherals, or display East Asian fonts on your computer.p  pWhy are networking UIs so poor Is networking intrinsically complex and difficult, reflecting the UI Due to security issues Or are the problems more of historical nature Or do you disagree with me entirelyp  pUPDATE 2009221 I think the commenters below have a good point in that appliance companies dont afford to contract software engineers, giving priority to hardware skill. But I feel that networking is worse than any other category when it comes to UI, terminology etc, so I am looking for answers that is particular to networking. p
Negative 3610 pI have a live search on my help page that searches our help database and returns the relevant results.

Negative 3610 pIm working on a game and have asked a couple questions on it already, and now I have another question to ask of you guys.p  pThe level format in this game is set up as a tilemap of Uint16s Im using SDL which are indices into an array of tilemapData structs.  One of the bits of the tilemapData struct is the isConductive bitboolean.p  pThe use of this bit is basically to create paths that connect various objects together into a single powerNet.

What are some ideas for how to mitigate this risk with these functions  I can provide more info on the structs used if its needed.p  pIve thought of modifying the code so that coderecursiveCheckTilecode only makes a recursive call when it reaches a junction and just interatively follows the conductive path its on otherwise, but that still seems to be only a partial solution since I cant know ahead of time how twisted or branching the path might be.p  pIf it makes a difference, speed is entirely unimportant here, since this function only runs once when the map is being processed before being used, and so using a little extra time wont hurt.p

Negative 3610 pI tried posting on their boards authors of this library, however it literally takes months for them to reply when it comes to the free software cant blame them.p  pBut anyways I have found that this library is behaving weirdly  for instance, a major problem with my application is when someone is trying to sign in through FTP, they provide a correct login and mistype the password, no reply is received from FTP server.p  pI tried doing the same from command window just to verify that its not the FTP servers fault and FTP commands were received instantaneously. p  pIt almost looks as though this library eats the commands.

Negative 3610 pWe have a small company team and even smaller Development team.  The current process is that each Sales Rep SR is the actual Project Manager of each web application sold.

Negative 3610 pWe have a website built in .NET and jQuery. We have custom jQuery to call the load method on a processing ASP.NET page. That ajax call is fired in a click handler, e.g.p  precodeSubmit.clickfunction   aselector.loadProcess.aspxdata  someDataObject, null, function     alertDone      return false  codepre  pOur issue is when we hit the Submit button the click is fired which calls the ajax to process it. People seem to be doubleclicking the button and therefore were getting multiple results in our database from the dual clicks. Does anyone have an idea on how to prevent this issue I considered something like disabling the button via JS but Id like to know of other ideas.p

I am using PHPs DateTime, DateInterval and DatePeriod objects for date handling they make dealing with timezones and recurrence easier despite their other drawbacks. Currently my design goes like thisp  pA Calendar object has a DatePeriod called window which contains all the display dates. e.g. the month of May, 1957.p  pThe Calendar also has an array schedules of Schedule objects. Each member of schedules must be aware of window.  So I implemented the Observer pattern between Calendar and Schedule.p  pSimilarly each Schedule has an array events of Events, which because they may be recurring, must also be aware of window. So I implemented the Observer pattern between Schedule and Event.p  pAll of this means that I have a cascade of copying the window to multiple other objects every time it changes.  p  pIt would be much more efficient if the Events in events knew who their enclosing Schedule was and that Schedule knew who its enclosing Calendar was.  Then when these objects needed to use window they could just ask for it.p  pAny thoughts on a good way of making this happen Is there a pattern I can refer top

Negative 3610 pI am following the a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comeaaDevPresentationModel.html relnofollowpresentation modela design pattern suggested by a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMartinFowler relnofollowMartin Fowlera for my GUI architecture in a Windows Forms project.p  pemThe essence of a Presentation Model is of a fully selfcontained class that represents all the data and behavior of the UI window, but without any of the controls used to render that UI on the screen. A view then simply projects the state of the presentation model onto the glass....em  Martin Fowlerp  pI am finding the concept very fluid and easy to understand except this one issue of data binding RadioButtons to properties on the DataDomain object.p  pSupposing I have a Windows Form with three radio buttons to depict some Mode options as p  ul liAutoli liManualli liImportli ul  pHow can I use boolean properties on DataDomain Objects to DataBind to these buttons I have tried many ways but to no avail. For example I would like to code like p  precoderbtnAutoMode.DataBindings.AddText, myBusinessObject, IsAutoMode rbtnManualMode.DataBindings.AddText, myBusinessObject, IsManualMode rbtnImportMode.DataBindings.AddText, myBusinessObject, IsImportMode codepre  pThere should be a fourth property like SelectedMode on the datadomain object which at the end should depict a single value like SelectedMode  Auto. I am trying to update this property when any of the IsAutoMode, IsManualMode or IsImportMode is changed, e.g. through the property setters. I have INotifyPropertyChanged implemented on my datadomain object so, updating any datadomain object property automatically updates my UI controls, thats not an issue.p  pThere is a good example of binding two radio buttons in StacknbspOverflow question ema hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions344964howdoiusedatabindingwithwindowsformsradiobuttonsHow do I use databinding with Windows Forms radio buttonsaem, but I am missing the link while implementing the same with three buttons. I am having very erratic behaviors for the radio buttons.p  pI hope I was able to explain it reasonably. I am actually in a hurry and could not put a detailed code on post, but any help in this regard is appreciated.p  pThere is a simple solution to this issue by exposing a method like p  precodepublic void SetModeModes mode    this.selectedMode  mode  codepre  pwhich could be called from the CheckedChanged event of the radio buttons from the UI and would perfectly set the SelectedMode on the business object, but I need to stretch the limits to verify whether this can be done by DataBinding.p

Negative 3610 pheres a definition of marshaling from Wikipediap  blockquote   pIn computer science, marshalling   similar to serialization is the   process of transforming the memory   representation of an object to a data   format suitable for storage or   transmission. It is typically used   when data must be moved between   different parts of a computer program   or from one program to another.p blockquote  pI have always done data serialization in php via its serialize function, usually on objects or arrays.

Negative 3610 pAs all developers do, we constantly deal with some kind of identifiers as part of our daily work. Most of the time, its about bugs or support tickets. Our software, upon detecting a bug, creates a package that has a name formatted from a timestamp and a version number, which is a cheap way of creating reasonably unique identifiers to avoid mixing packages up. Example emBug Report 20101214 174856 6.4b2em.p  pMy brain just isnt that good at remembering numbers.

Negative 3610 pIm creating a service that will gather user data such as username, name, email, login password. How do I securely store this data One thing I was thinking is store it encrypted in the DB so that if anyone gets access to the DB they wont be able to use the data.p  pBut that arises two issues  1  much much slower search of the DB and 2 the encryption key will still be stored in the Perl script that will encrypt the data submitted by the user so if someone gets access to the whole server theyll still be able to decrypt all data.p  pSo I was wondering what do services such as Twitter, Facebook, Hotmail, etc. use to securely store datap  pBTW as I said Im working with PerlMySQL.p  pThank you all nice peoplep

Negative 3610 pI am trying to build a django service to which numerous clients will send data. Each client will represent an authenticated user, who might be connected to the internet or not, so the client will aggregate the data and send them when a connection is available. The data should also be persisted locally so that they are accessed quickly without hitting the server. p  pThe nature of the data is simple. It has to do with game achievements, so each user will have a collection of achievements they have achieved. As a consequence, there are no consistency issues, as each user will be sending their own achievement stats, and no user will edit someone elses data. p  pI am trying to find the most suitable medium for this. My first thought was POST HTTP requests, which the django server will handle. A python client will login and send data by performing these requests. Can anyone suggest better alternatives, or give me reasons why this setup is suitable or not p  pId also like to know what you would suggest for a formatway to obtain the data from the client side. I was thinking json or yamlp  pEDIT 2 This question has been revamped after S.Lotts recommendation. p
Negative 3610 pSo for example if we have a flash video already buffered and playing, or an autocomplete active with input, focus, and a dropdown visible and maybe even loading something but only have HTML of the full document and a copy of the HTML earlier, how can we merge them into the live DOM without the users state being interruptedp  pOrdinarily Id just program a specific fix, specifying the right area to change given its div name, manually but that is not a known variable for the situation at hand Im programming a Pythonic MVC framework with AJAX.p  pI want to change the smallest amount of nodes, and probably the deepest nodes that I can get away with.p  pIts ok to require IDs for some of the nodes e.g flash or autocomplete widget but not possible to expect this for all nodes  so in some situations perhaps node position and types will be available to compare documents.p  pI understand this will not be a complete solution but in some cases it will be all that is required.p

Negative 3610 pIm a beginner at ASP.NET and I was learning how to use it through a hrefhttpwww.asp.netmvcsamplesmvcmusicstore relnofollowthis tutoriala. I use Linux, so Im using Mono 2.6.7. Ive had to stray off the path of the tutorial several times to get things to work under Mono including using a patched version of MVC 2 that I would link to, but I am unable to as new users can only post one hyperlink, but theres one problem that I havent been able to fix form validation. I set up my validation metadata like thisp  precodeusing System using System.ComponentModel using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations using System.Web.Mvc  namespace MvcMusicStore.Models   [MetadataTypetypeofAlbumMetaData]  public partial class Album     [BindExclude  AlbumID]   public class AlbumMetaData       [ScaffoldColumnfalse]    public object AlbumID  get set      [DisplayNameGenre]    public object GenreID  get set      [DisplayNameArtist]    public object ArtistID  get set      [RequiredErrorMessage  An Album Title is required]    [StringLength160]    public object Title  get set      [DisplayNameAlbum Art URL]    [StringLength1024]    public object AlbumArtUrl  get set      [RequiredErrorMessage  Price is required]    [Range0.01, 100.00, ErrorMessage  Price must be between 0.01 and 100.00]    public object Price  get set        codepre  pAnd I set up my View like thisp  precodeltpgt     lt Html.LabelFormodel gt model.Title gt  lt Html.TextBoxFormodel gt model.Title gt     lt Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.Title gt ltpgt  ltpgt  lt Html.LabelFormodel gt model.Price gt  lt Html.TextBoxFormodel gt model.Price gt  lt Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.Price gt ltpgt  ltpgt  lt Html.LabelFormodel gt model.AlbumArtUrl gt  lt Html.TextBoxFormodel gt model.AlbumArtUrl gt  lt Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.AlbumArtUrl gt ltpgt codepre  pHowever, when I test the form by giving it bad data, I dont get the error messages I set. When I leave Title blank, I get Validation error System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.RequiredAttribute Title, and I get a similar error when I leave Price blank. If I enter an outofrange number for Price or a long string for Title or AlbumArtUrl, the script ignores the problem, doesnt leave an error message and lets the form submit however, if I type a very large number into Price, I get The value emlarge numberem is invalid..p  pHow can I fix this Is there an alternate method to Html.ValidationMessageFor that I can use Is it a problem with my model Is it just a problem with Mono Please helpp

Negative 3610 pim new to this whole portlets my question came from the fact that our company is outsourcing this kind of development for another company. and they are facing this issue, which is there are too many requests going to the DB and many portlets on the same page make connection to the DB.p  pim thinking probably there is a better way , like for example having a controller over all of those portlets that will fetch data from DB for all related portlets, and then store them into session or something . or maybe one portlet hidden maybe that will make all the calls and store the values that it get from DB for each portlet into session variables.p  pthey are using RAD, and WEbsphere Portal server. is that possiblep  pthanksp

Negative 3610 pHow do you store facts within which data is related And how do you configure the measure For example, I have a data warehouse that tracks the lifecycle of an order, which changes states  ordered, to shipped, to refunded. And for a state like refunded, it is not always there. So in my model, I am employing the transaction store model, so every time the order changes state, it is another row in the fact table. So, for an order that was placed in april, and refunded in may, there will be two rows  one with a state of ordered and another with a state of refunded. So if the user wanted to see all the orders placedordered in april, and wanted to see how many of those orders got refunded, how would he see that Is this a MDX query that will be run at runtime Is this is a calculated measure I can store in the cube How would I do that My thought process is that it should be a fact that the user can use in a pivottable, but Im not sure.....p

Negative 3610 pIm fairly new to JS and not very familiar with jQuery, but Id like to give a shot at dynamically calling a hrefhttpscode.google.compslimboxwikijQueryAPIMultipleimages relnofollowslimboxs multiimage functiona.p  pFor example, there is a photoslider that randomly cycles through 3 images on my website, and I would like slimbox to show 2 more images for the first and 1 more for the last.  This means slimbox will display a total of 6 images in the slideshow.  p  pSo in case you need it, heres the detailed walk through  when the user visits my site, the user will see a div block that shows 1 image at a time.  The image in the photoslider will rotate out to the next one of the 3 randomly loaded.  When the user clicks on the image, the user will trigger the slimbox lightweight lightbox and a larger slideshow will take up the screen dimming the background.  Through slimbox, the user will see a up to a total of 6 images cycle through.p  pIn order to create a dynamic variable, I tried to use EVAL within a FOR loop, but this fails when running jQuery.

Negative 3610 pThe solution I propose involves quite a bit of code, but you can just copy it all and past it in a VS test solution assuming you have SqLite installed, and you should be able to run the tests yourself.p  pAs I have been struggling with the object identity versus object equality and database identity problem using Nhibernate, I have read various posts. However, I could not get a clear picture of how to properly set up object identity in conjunction with collections. Basically, the big problem, as I got, is that once an object is added to a collection its identity as derived by the GetHashCode method cannot change. The preferred way to implement the GetHasHCode is to use a business key. But what if the business key was not the right one I would like to have that entity updated with its new business key. But then my collections are out of sync as I violated the immutability of the identity of that object. p  pThe below code is a proposal to solve this problem. However, as I am certainly not a NHibernate expert and also not a very experienced developer, I would gladly receive comments from more senior developers whether this is a viable approach.   p

Negative 3610 pI am attempting to write an application that uses very large textures. The idea is that you work on a scaled version of the texture in realtime modifying shaders and when finished the application would apply your changes to the original unscaled large texture. The problem is that profiling shows something like the followingp  ul liimg.src  filename 500msli litexImage2d... 1500msli libindrendering 100msli lireadPixels 300msli liPut into canvas 1000msli liSave canvas to file 300msli ul  pEssentially this means the browser locks up for almost four seconds when saving the larger unscaled texture, with the user unable to do anything. Is it possible to do this asynchronously so that the browser stays responsive It needs to all be done in javascript and clientside, as Im using local files HTML5 filefilesystem.p  pWeb workers sounded like a good idea, but they are unable to access the DOM, so I cant use the browsers image loading and saving functionality, and they have no access to the WebGL context so they cant call texImage2d, which takes the most time.p  pDue to the size and number of images I cannot load them all into memory as textures when the page initially loads.p  pIs there anything that can be done to make this more responsive to the user Id like them to be able to continue working on the next image while the previous one renders.p

Negative 3610 pIm using a semaphore to hand work off to another thread in Python.  I.e. the master thread will put an item on a queue, then call the semaphores codereleasecode method the worker thread will call codeacquirecode on the semaphore, then pop an item off the queue to work on.p  pTheres also a special TERMINATE item that the master can put on the queue, which instructs the worker to end.  My question is, should the worker aim to issue codeacquirecodes to match any outstanding codereleasecodes on the semaphore, before it terminates  The semaphore belongs to the worker object and is not used again after the thread terminates the process however may be longlived and create many worker objectsthreadssemaphores in future.p  ol lipIs it safe to abandon the semaphore with a nonzero count  I suspect it is but I want to double check.pli lipRegardless of whether its safe, do you subjectively think its nicer to fully clean up the semaphore before endingpli ol  pIm mostly interested in the semaphore behaviour in Python and more specifically CPython.  However any general wisdom on semaphores in other languages, such as Cs pthreads, would be welcome too.p

Negative 3610 pI am using two managed object contexts in my iOS app.  The first context is the parent of the second, utilizing the new nested managed contexts model introduced in iOS 5.  Both of these contexts were created with the NSMainQueueConcurrencyType.p  pWhat I am trying to achieve is a nice way to handle temporary additions and edits to my data that may or may not get saved and have a logical distinction where the main controller object owns the first context parent and the subcontroller owns the 2nd context child.  Changes are thusly bubbled up and the main controller can decide whether or not to save its context.  The fact that my contexts are nested requires that they be setup strongnotstrong using the confinement pattern NSConfinementConcurrencyType.p  pMy question is  is this pattern Im trying to implement flawed  I just read from multiple posts that using multiple contexts on the main thread is probably not the best idea most of the time.  Im also struggling to determine where I should be using codeperformBlockAndWaitcode on my contexts.  Should I use it every time a message is sent to a context, even if Im sure Im currently executing in the main thread  Does this include spots where I am creating a new NSManagedObject like sop  precode    [theManagedObjectContext performBlockAndWait              id myObj  [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForNameMyEntity inManagedObjectContexttheManagedObjectContext]          more stuff done here     ] codepre  pWhat about spots where I make changes to my NSManagedObjects  Do I need to wrap those in a codeperformBlockAndWaitcode as well  What about spots where I use an NSFetchedResultsController and send it the codeperformFetchcode messagep  pAm I better off just using one context and figuring out how the undo manager worksp  pThe documentation for these new Core Data features is very sparse from what Ive seen...p

Negative 3610 pI was thinking about patterns which allow me to return both computation result and statusp  pThere are few approaches which I could think aboutp  ul lipfunction returns computation result, status is being returned via out parameter not all languages support out parameters and this seems wrong, since in general you dont expect parameters to be modified.pli lipfunction returns objectpair consisting both values downside is that you have to create artificial class just to return function result or use pair which have no semantic meaning  you know which argument is which by its order.pli lipif your status is just successfailure you can return computation value, and in case of error throw an exception look like the best approach, but works only with successfailure scenario and shouldnt be abused for controlling normal program flow.pli lipfunction returns value, function arguments are delegates to onSuccessonFailure procedures. pli lipthere is a statefull method class which have status field, and method returning computation results I prefer having statelessimmutable objects.pli ul  pPlease, give me some hints on pros, cons and situations preconditions of using aforementioned approaches or show me other patterns which I could use preferably with hints on preconditions when to use them.p  hr  pEDIT Realworld example I am developing java ee internet application and I have a class resolving request parameters converting them from string to some business logic objects.

Negative 3610 pI have a lowpriority PDFdrawing NSOperation.  I am using the function CGContextDrawPDFPage to draw the page.  p  pAs best I can tell, the app will not switch to another thread while the CGContextDrawPDFPage function is executing.  I suppose I need to break up my graphics context into several smaller contexts to get around that.  But I still have one problem  how can I persuade the operation to allow other threads to perform their tasks before starting that draw  The way things are set up right now, the app draws the page right away, even though the thread priority is set to zero.p  pHere is the code that adds the NSOperation to the queuep  precodeMyNSOperationSubclass op  [[MyNSOperationSubclass alloc]initWithStuff stuff] [op setThreadPriority0.] [self.drawingQueue addOperationop] codepre  pHere is some code within MyNSOperationSubclassp  precodevoid drawStuff      NSLogdrawStuff     autoreleasepool           some code to setup the graphics context and PDF page here         CGContextDrawPDFPagecontext, page         [self finish]   finishes the NSOperation           void main      NSLogmain     autoreleasepool          [self drawStuff]         void start      self.isExecuting  YES     [NSThread detachNewThreadSelectorselectormain toTargetself withObjectnil]  codepre  pwhat happens is that even though the thread priority is set to zero, the setup code is so quick that the NSOperation gets into the CGContextDrawPDFPage call right as the operation is started.  But  once that call has started, the thread wont yield to other threads until it has finished.  So the drawing operation happens right away, which is the opposite of what I want to do.p  pEDIT  After taking a closer look, the first answerer is correct that the CGContextDrawPDFPage call does not always prevent a thread from yielding.  But even with a nonconcurrent operation, I still have the problem that it finishes quickly, rather than waiting around for other, higherpriority stuff to happen.p  pEDIT 2  Apparently I dont understand how thread priorities work.  After changing it to a nonconcurrent operation, the thread priority of the operation thread is 0.5, even though I called [op setThreadPriority 0] before adding it to the queue.p

Negative 3610 pIn my app, I have an equalizer with a visualizer behind it. p  pThe equalizer is a series of dots which are imageviews with a path drawn between them using Quartz 2D also with tick marks on the bottom and left to denote the frequency and gain amounts. Behind that is a visualizer done using OpenGL with a CAEAGLLayer.p  pThe way this is set up is there is a sub view of my view controllers main view that handles the visualizer, and above that is another subview of the main view that draws the path. Above both of them are the image views for the eq points.p  pWhat happens is, the path draws fine until a song starts and the visualizer starts to draw. It seems like it wipes out the Quartz 2D above it. Even having it call setNeedsDisplay on the view above it every time it draws is not working. Like OpenGL is given exclusive access to draw there. The UIImageView eq points however, stay visible.p  pIs there any way to use Quartz 2D on top of a view with a gl layer Id prefer not to use OpenGL to draw the path and tick marks using OpenGL because I would have to draw to either a 512x512 or 1024x1024 texture and scale it, so it would not look perfect, and Ive already got the working Quartz code to draw everything.p

Negative 3610 pIm an absolute newbie to Varnish amp caching in general, so this question might be trivial to some p  pIm building a web app in rails, and I was looking at some options to cache content on production servers. Ive so far looked at Varnish, and am slightly concerned about the noncaching of withcookie requests. I understand why such a behaviour is intended, but there is one usecase that could really benefit if there was some way to cache content over cookies.p  pIn my particular case, a lot of urls have data that is same irrespective of the loggedin user. For example, tripadvisor would possibly be returning every loggedin user the same data at least majority of the data for a hotel listing. So essentially, although cookies would accompany the request  response, about 90 of the page would be common for each user.p  pIn such scenarios, is it possible to use Varnish to cache such urls  pages maybe the common part only. And if yes, then how.p  pThanks a ton p

Negative 3610 pI am using Javascriptwith Mootools to dynamically build a large page using HTML template elements, copying the same template many times to populate the page. Within each template I use string keywords that need to be replaced to create the unique IDs. Im having serious performance issues however in that it takes multiple seconds to perform all these replacements, especially in IE. The code looks like this p  precodevar fieldTemplate  .fieldTemplate[0] var fieldTr  fieldTemplate.clonetrue, true fieldTr.removeClassfieldTemplate replaceIdsHelperfieldTr, FIELDNODEID, fieldNodeId parentTable.grabfieldTr codepre  preplaceIdsHelper is the problem method according to IE9s profiler. Ive tried two implementations of this methodp  precode Retrieve the entire HTML body of the element, replace the string and set the HTML back. var html  rootElem.gethtml.replacenew RegExpreplaceStr, g, id rootElem.sethtml, html codepre  pandp  precode Load the child elements and replace just their IDs selectively rootElem.getElements.eachfunctionelem      var elemId  elem.getid     if elemId  null elemId  elemId.replacereplaceStr, id     elem.setid, elemId  codepre  pHowever, both of these approaches are extremely slow given how many times this method gets calledabout 200.... Everything else runs fine, its only replacing these IDs which seems to be a major performance bottleneck. Does anyone know if theres a way to do this efficiently, or a reason it might be running so slow The elements start hidden and arent grabbed by the DOM until after theyre created so theres no redrawing happening.p  pBy the way, the reason Im building the page this way is to keep the code clean, since we need to be able to create new elements dynamically after loading as well. Doing this from the server side would make things much more complicated.p

So if a customer has 2 addresses, this is rather simple, check if they are the same, if so, keep one that is a residential, remove other, update links, in this case i just need to know the above.p  pBut what about when the customer has more then one address, how do you go about checking the pairs one by one. I know you can join the table on itself, but how do you decide which to keep, as going through all the pairs will delete all the addresses if they are all identicalp  pThen there is the case of when one residential address exists, and two identical postal address, I need to remove one of the postal addresses, but still check that a residential address exists for the customer.p  pI realise this is a lot of corner cases, so if anyone can simply help with the structures to use to make these checks, that would be immensly helpfulp  pFor you visual people, assume the data looks like thisp  precodeID   CustID   Address   Type 1     25       123 St    R 2     36       567 Rd    R 3     36       567 Rd    R    lt should be removed 4     36       567 Rd    P    lt should be removed 5     25       99 Lane   P 6     25       99 Lane   P    lt should be removed 7     25       66 Way    P codepre

Negative 3610 pstrongBackgroundstrong I am designing a software application that reads millions or much more files and either converts or just parses those files. Part of requirement is to build a scalable and distributed system so that reading and parsing can be scaled accordingly.p  pBasically, a minimally detailed list of filenames is one DB and Clients need to access the list to know which files need to be parsedconverted next. The files again are on another serverlocation. While most of the pieces are designed, one critical piece that needs a revisit is a design of feeding the filenames to different clients.p  pI have two options nowp  ol lipDesign a single service that sits next to DB and channelizes all requests to file names and feeds the clients. So in this case, Clients talk to the servicepredefined protocolformat and get the list.pli lipDesign Clients to talk directly to DB and implement synchronizationchannelization within clients.pli ol  pMy only concern with first option is that, is that a scalable architecturedesign Has anyone dealt with such an circumstance in scalable architecture where one resource becomes a critical in scaling In my case it could be One service feedingservicing all clientsp

Negative 3610 pHeres an interesting problem Lets say we have a set codeAcode for which the following are permittedp  blockquote   ul   liInsert xli   liFindmin xli   liDelete the nth inserted element in Ali   ul blockquote  pCreate a data structure to permit these in logarithmic time.p  pThe most common solution is with a heap. AFAIK, heaps with decreasekey based on a value  generally the index when an element was added keep a table with the codePos[1...N]code meaning the codeicodeth added value is now on index codePos[i]code, so it can find the key to decrease in O1. Can someone confirm thisp  pAnother question is how we solve the problem with STL containers i.e. with codesetscode, codemapscode or codepriority queuescode. A partial solution i found is to have a priority queue with indexes but ordered by the value to these indexes. I.e. codeA[1..N]code are our added elements in order of insertion. codepriqueuecode with code1..Ncode based on comparison of codeA[i],A[j]code. Now we keep a table with the deleted indexes and verify if the minvalue index was deleted. Unfortunately, Findmin becomes slightly proportional with no. of deleted values. Any alternative ideasp  pNow I thought how to formulate a more general problem. Create a data structure similar to multimap with codeltkey, valuegtcode elements. codeKeys are not unique. Values are.code Insert, find one based on key, find based on value, delete one based on key and delete based on value must be permitted OlogN.p  pPerhaps a bit oddly, this is possible with a manually implemented Binary Search Tree with a modification for every node operation a hashtable or a map based on value is updated with the new pointer to the node.p  pSimilar to having a strictly ordered codestdsetcode if equal key order by value with a hashtable on value giving the iterator to the element containing that value.p  pPossible with codestdsetcode and a stdmaphash table as described by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq92093231293643Chong Luoa.p

Negative 3610 pI have an object in my class like sop  precodethis.options        a 1,      b 2,      ...  codepre  pI just wondered if there was a way to attach the options object to the current scope in Javascript, such that I can refer to codeacode and codebcode directly instead of codethis.options.acode and codethis.options.bcode. Something likep  precodeattachthis.options var myVariable  a  3  4 detachthis.options codepre  porp  precodewith this.options,      code here  var myVariable  a  3  4  codepre  pIn the above, the codeattachcode and codewithcode have the effect of taking all of the children of codethis.optionscode and attaching them to the current scope so they are accessible via codeacode instead of codethis.options.acode. The codewithcode version simply detaches codethis.optionscode once youre done, enclosing the potentiallydamaging attaching to within that scope.p  pAs long as it works in the SpidermonkeyMozilla engine, I dont mind if its not portable.p  pI only mention this because of curiosity amp laziness all the nested names are getting annoying to type out, and I know that in the R language this is possible in fact, the syntax in the snippets above is almost exactly what youd write in R to achieve this.p

Negative 3610 pMy situation is that my app uses core data, and needs to load images from that core data to show in a table view. Because of the time it takes to do that, it needs to run in a background thread. So i have code such as thisp  precodedispatchasyncqueue,       if self.cellInfo.numberOfMediaItems gt 0           int i  0          int numberOfThumbnails  MINself.cellInfo.numberOfMediaItems, 3          while i lt numberOfThumbnails              Media media  [self.entry.media objectAtIndexi]              UIImage image  [media getThumbnail]             [self.mediaArray addObjectimage]             i                    dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,          self.isFinishedProcessing  YES          [self setNeedsDisplay]        codepre  pThis speeds the process up considerably, and the images appear in the background when its ready.p  pThe problem is, sometimes itll have the foreground thread try and access core data at the same time as the background thread. It doesnt like this, and so it crashes. This must be a situation that a lot of developers get in, and thus one with a solution. I wanted to know how to deal with the situation so my app stops crashing when they both start accessing core data at the same timep

Negative 3610 pWhen I perform a refactoring extract variable for instance in a .mxml file, IntelliJ reformats the contents whole codeltmxScriptgtcode element. We dont want it to do that because it makes the commits noisier than it needs to be. This in turn complicates merges. p  pPart of the problem is that were transitioning from Eclipse to IntelliJ  which has generally been a big improvement  and were still getting our code style sorted out. So there are some inconsistencies in the format actually present in a particular file. A problem, which to some degree predates our migration. We are working on getting a standard format published, which will help. But we dont need the merge conflicts. This is out of character for IntelliJ. How do we prevent thisp

In happens before relation concept all code executed prior to start of thread is completed. The concept is  instance variables are shared across multiple threads  here there are two threads running  the main thread and the Tester thread.  So i should shared with both threads  if i is shared and if happensbefore relation is maintained before starting Tester thread then the value of incremented i should be visible to the Tester threadp
Negative 3610 pI know that there are a lot of threads on monitoring andor limiting network bandwidth usage, but none of them provide a satisfactory answer. Here is my problemp  pI have a legacy java application which communicates to different servers like HTTP and JMS. My application can also receive incoming HTTP requests as well. Now, this application is now supposed to be deployed in a cloud infrastructure to provide a SaaS model. The pricing model for the consumers is supposed to be based on the bandwidth flow in and out of the application. p  pSo, we need to device a way to count the number of bytes flowing in and out of the application through all sources basically, all sockets that are created. The code base is huge and uses third party communication libraries in certain cases so active code changes are not possible everywhere. Also, the application is a legacy java application supported on all platforms, the solution should be workable on all platforms as well. I dont want to use third party external monitoring tools to do the job. Instead, need to find a solution which can be baked into the system, strongpassivelystrong, to get the job done.p  pWhat are the waysoptionssolutions to get this done Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 3610 pI know questions like this have been asked here, but a lot of the existing questions have answers that are now outdated. What I am needing is the following a web page with preferably only CSS and HTML that has a fixed and centered background image. The dimensions of the background image that I am using are 1024x1024 with the idea being that the image will cover the screen in landscape and portrait modes. The background image must also be fixed, meaning that if the content on the page is scrolled, the background image does not scroll with the content.p  pI have a solution that emnearlyem worksp  pstrongCSSstrongp  precodebackground      backgroundimage urlbackground.jpg     backgroundpositioncenter      backgroundrepeat norepeat     width 100      height 100      position fixed      zindex 0   codepre  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltbodygt     ltdiv idbackgroundgtltdivgt     lt content here gt ltbodygt codepre  pThis solution works fine in portrait mode fixed and centered are both working fine. But when I turn the ipad into landscape mode, the background image does not immediately resize to fill the new width, insead it shows a white vertical stripe on the righthand side. When I scroll the content, then the background image resizes and fills the width correctly.p  pDoes anyone know why the resize of the background is only happening when the page content is scrolled and does anyone know how to get this working correctly I am only interested in this working in iOS 5, so the answer does not have to take other browsers or iOS 4 into account.p

Negative 3610 pIm trying to have a custom MKAnnotationView PostFlag do two things when it is selected 1 expand to show details about the annotation, and 2 become centered in the map.  The trouble is that when the annotation is selected, the MKMapView sometimes dramatically zooms out.  This causes my logic for handling significant zoom events to run, which collects nearby annotations into common annotation views, causing the annotation views to reload, which often replaces the annotation the user was trying to view with a closed annotation view.p  pMy attempts to fix this started by trying to be sure that I dont set the region incorrectly with a span that would cause the zoomout for example when I try to center the annotation.  Everything there seems ok  the region is correct when I set it.  The delegate method mapViewdidChangeRegionanimated still gets called though with a zoomed out region.  Im not sure exactly whats going on there.  p  pSetting scrollEnabled and zoomEnabled to NO before changing the region to center the annotation doesnt seem to have any effect.p  pIt doesnt matter if I animate the expansion of the annotation view or not  the zooming still occurs.p  pDoes this sound familiar to anyone  Heres some codep  precode void mapViewMKMapView mapView didSelectAnnotationViewMKAnnotationView view      self.selectedFlag  PostFlagview  disables scrollingzooming on the map      move region to show expanded flag     float size  mselectedFlag.expandedHeight  2.0  50 getting a comfortable position in the display     float dLat  size  mapView.region.span.latitudeDelta  mapView.frame.size.height  get span in degrees from degree to pixel ratio      build a new coordinate for our center location     CLLocationCoordinate2D originalCoord  PostAnnotationmselectedFlag.annotation.coordinate     CLLocationCoordinate2D offsetCoord  CLLocationCoordinate2DMakeoriginalCoord.latitude  dLat, originalCoord.longitude      adjust the map view to center on that new coordinate     [mmapView setRegion MKCoordinateRegionMakeoffsetCoord, mmapRegionAtTimeOfLastUpdate.span animated YES]     void setSelectedFlagPostFlag  val      ifmselectedFlag              mselectedFlag.expanded  NO         [mselectedFlag release]           ifval         mselectedFlag  [val retain]     else         mselectedFlag  nil      ifmselectedFlag              mselectedFlag.expanded  YES          [mmapView bringSubviewToFront mselectedFlag]         mmapView.scrollEnabled  NO         mmapView.zoomEnabled  NO          else              mmapView.scrollEnabled  YES         mmapView.zoomEnabled  YES       codepre  pWhen a PostFlag collapses, it tells this view controller and the vc reenabled scrolling and zooming on the map.

Beside that, Im not convinced that writing interfaces with only getters or setters is a good practice.p  pPlease help p
Negative 3610 pI am trying to achieve the following result. I am using Active Admin to develop an application where I need to provide the means to navigate nested categories and subcategories to the user.

Put another way, user selects categories, is presented with the root categories, selects category1 and the grid refreshes with the subcategories of category1.p  pI have played around with awesomenestedset and various approaches using member actions and the inherited resources gem to try and get a categoriesidcategories route working to no avail.

Negative 3610 pMy coworker posted this question yesterday a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions125726237secondefstartuptimeevenfortinydbcontext7second EF startup time even for tiny DbContexta.p  pAfter taking his code and moving it to a separate solution to isolate it as much as possible, I found that the containing projects platform target had a profound affect on the runtime of the EF startup process.p  pWhen targeting x64, I saw that the test took 7 seconds to spin up the first DbContext and lt1 second to spin up the second DbContext consistent with my coworkers findings who is also targeting x64. However when I switched the platform target to x86, the first DbContext spin up time was reduced by about 4 seconds down to 3.34633 seconds while the second DbContext took the same amount of time as the x64 case.p  pGiven this, it appears the Entity Framework is going through a much different initialization process when targeting a 64bit system vs 32bit system.

Can I use this to practice Java Because now when I write anything in Java and compile it, it only outputs whats in the layout XML.p

Negative 3610 pI have in my application three classes codeUsercode, codeGroupcode, codeCompanycode which do not belong to the same inheritance tree, as their names reveal. Each class has a constructor which receives a number of different parameters i.e codeUserString name, String password, int typecode, codeGroupString name, String namecode, codeCompanyString name, int employees, boolean isValidcode. The number of the paraameters that each constructors requires is not the same for all the classes. I have created a class codeReadDataFromFilecode to read some data from  txt files and to create new Objects passing the data as paaraameters to the above constructors. The code of this class is apparently the same for every type, except for one method which creates the objects. Consequently it is not appropriate to create three distinct classes, but I had better to aim at a better design approach. p  pMy question is whether the opportune design on this occasion is a Generic class, or an abstract class and implementing in its subclass the one method which differs codecreateObjectcode, assuming that the necessary data coming from the txt file are put into a String array with differnt length for each type. I would like to follow the approach of Generic class codeclass ReadDataFromFileltTgtcode , but I cannot find how I should handle the different types, since each one requires a call of a different constructor. Should I check for the type with codeinstanceofcode Should I pass to the method the class of each object Or is there a better way    p

Negative 3610 pWe have a solr search implemented. We are encountering a situation and wish to tackle it as cleanly as possible.  We have a book that has an isbn number and it has a relation of isbn numbers in different bindings.  When we perform a solr search we would like the first instance of that book to show up and none of its related instances.  In other words show the first  occurrence in the search based on the relation and its own isbn number.  I know that sounds confusing but let me elaborate.p  pIf I search for books and I get one that has a main isbn  9781617840227 and related isbns  9781617147197, 1617147192.

Recently Ive had reports that the HTML mode in the WYSIWYG editor that is, when we can see and manipulate the actual HTML being generated is not editable in Chrome 27  it works in 26. It works in Safari tested 6.0.5, 8536.30.1, Firefox tested 19 and 21 and Opera, all four on Macs. Lets not speak of IE. I pulled a Webkit nightly r151773 and that also shows the problem, suggesting this is a Webkit problem.p  pThis setup works by building both a standard codetextareacode with the HTML, and an iframe with the WYSIWYG content. When we open or close HTML mode, one is hidden codedisplaynonecode and the other is shown, depending on which way were going. Its just that in Chrome, one cant change the content in the codetextareacode. Cant get the cursor in it, cant select text, cant change the contents in the developer tools  just cant do anything with it.p  pWhat could be causing this in Chrome but not Safari, FF or Opera What should I be looking for in terms of attributes on codetextareacode which might be causing thisp  pETA It looks like this is a bug in Chromium, Webkit, or both.

Negative 3610 pI learned MIPS assembly in a systemslevel programming course last semester, and have been looking into the Intel and AMD architectures now.p  pI was having trouble trying to write a simple x8664 program in GAS that calls printf and prints argc, and argv[04]. To help me understand how to do it correctly, I used the gcc S to look at the assembler for the C source file test.cp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt int main int argc, char  argv[]      printfd,s,s,s,s,sn, argc, argv[0], argv[1], argv[2], argv[3], argv[4] return 0  codepre  pThe output of gcc S masmintel test.c wasp  precode    .file   test.c     .intelsyntax noprefix     .section    .rodata .LC0     .string d,s,s,s,s,sn     .text     .globl  main     .type   main, function main .LFB0     .cfistartproc     push    rbp     .cfidefcfaoffset 16     .cfioffset 6, 16     mov rbp, rsp     .cfidefcfaregister 6     sub rsp, 32     mov DWORD PTR [rbp4], edi     mov QWORD PTR [rbp16], rsi     mov rax, QWORD PTR [rbp16]     add rax, 32     mov rsi, QWORD PTR [rax]     mov rax, QWORD PTR [rbp16]     add rax, 24     mov r8, QWORD PTR [rax]     mov rax, QWORD PTR [rbp16]     add rax, 16     mov rdi, QWORD PTR [rax]     mov rax, QWORD PTR [rbp16]     add rax, 8     mov rcx, QWORD PTR [rax]     mov rax, QWORD PTR [rbp16]     mov rdx, QWORD PTR [rax]     mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp4]     mov QWORD PTR [rsp], rsi     mov r9, r8     mov r8, rdi     mov esi, eax     mov edi, OFFSET FLAT.LC0     mov eax, 0     call    printf     mov eax, 0     leave     .cfidefcfa 7, 8     ret     .cfiendproc .LFE0     .size   main, .main     .ident  GCC GNU 4.7.2 20121109 Red Hat 4.7.28     .section    .note.GNUstack,,progbits codepre  pTo be honest, I dont think I completely understand what is going on in lines 1838. To me, it looks like gcc stores a pointer to argc and argv[0] at [rbp4] and [rbp16], then loads the [rbp16] into rax as a basepoint pointer to argv[0], and adds 8,16,24,... to make rax point to argv[1,2,3,...], and then loads that address into the appropriate register to pass to printf.p  pWith that interpretation, I was able to understand enough about how the command line arguments are passed to main to be able to fix my GAS code to thisp  precode.intelsyntax noprefix .globl  main  .data fmt    .asciz  d,s,s,s,s,sn  .text main     push    rbp     mov     rbp, rsp      mov     rdx, QWORD PTR [rsi]     mov     rcx, QWORD PTR [rsi8]     mov     r8, QWORD PTR [rsi16]     mov     r9, QWORD PTR [rsi24]     push    [rsi32]     mov     rsi, rdi     mov     rdi, offset fmt     xor     rax, rax     call    printf  return     mov     rsp, rbp     pop     rbp     xor     rax, rax     ret codepre  pThis produces the same output as the test.c does, as well as the gccgenerated test.s. So my question is this.... Is there anything wrong with the way I did it And if not, why would gcc generate such a complicated way to do something that is this simple Maybe its just the way the compiler interprets the use of arraysp  pI suppose my way is technically correct since it produces the same output, but I want to make sure it is an acceptable way to do it.p

If BIOS does not provide this facility then can I use CC to find out Total RAM size And call CC code from assembly What function of CC would be used to find Total RAM sizep  pRemember that my assembly code will do a cold boot and there would be no operating system to provide any facility to my code.p  pEDITEDp  pI read the website a hrefhttpwiki.osdev.orgDetectingMemory28x8629 relnofollowhttpwiki.osdev.orgDetectingMemory28x8629a.

Negative 3610 pCan anyone give me a definitive answer as to whether or not TFS 2012 allows multiple build controllers for a single collection  I cant seem to find anything that says no, but it also isnt well explained as to if it is possible. I understand that the typical solution is to expand by adding more agents, but the purpose for a secondary controller is that I want to roll out a second custom workflow with separate assemblies to run against the same collection without breaking our original workflow which is also run using custom assemblies. So this is sort of a bluegreen or drainfill approach for testing new build steps on a live system without breaking the existing system. It appears to almost work but weve also seen some TFS connectivity issues connection terminations when fetching code for the build workspace which did not exist before we tried this. p
Negative 3610 pIm working with a small team developing an application in CASP.NET and recently weve run into an issue with authentication. The way our program authenticates users is by using Forms Authentication and validating the user input against our companys Active Directory. This all works fine in our development environment, but a problem arose when we actually deployed this to instore users. I dont know a whole lot about the instore computer setup, but all computers in a store are logged into Windows using the same account. Because of the way the computer system is set up, all computers in the store share a lot of the same information, including cookies. Obviously, this is a problem because Forms Authentication stores login credentials in cookies. If a single user is on the site, there is no problem, but if another user tries to access the site at the same time, the website is behaving as if they are both accessing the website from the same computer its similar to trying to access a website in two different tabs. p  pSo far, weve looked into using a cookieless solution storing login information in the Uri, but this does not seem like a viable solution since so much of our program relies on posting user specific data back to the site. There is also no chance we will be able to change the way the store computers are set up. What we need is a way to have two users logged in simultaneously, as if they were on two different tabs on the same browser and computer. p  pI honestly have no idea where to start with this and I greatly appreciate any advice.p  pEdit Im sorry that Im doing a terrible job at explaining this, I also have very few details. Ill try to explain it better. Our web application is being used in our companys stores and the way the store computers work is that they all remote into another server. Thats where Im very low on details, but it appears as though all of the computers in the store share information, such as cookies. This means if UserA logs in on computer 1, theyre fine. However, if UserB logs in to the site from computer 2 in the same store, due to the way the computers are configured, computer 1 now has the authentication cookie from computer 2 and thus both computers are now logged in as UserB on our website. The same happens if either of them log out, the cookie is invalidated and both computers are logged out. I hope that helped clear things up.p

Negative 3610 pWe are currently tasked with implementing a preferably simple authentication system for a mobile application communication with a RESTful API.

The validation needs to be easy to extend and loosely coupled and also I need to be able to call this validation beforehand instead of adding everything.p  precodepublic static class ValidationFactory      public static LazyltIFieldValidationgt PhoneValidation  new LazyltIFieldValidationgtgtnew PhoneNumberValidation     public static LazyltIFieldValidationgt EmailValidation  new LazyltIFieldValidationgtgtnew EmailValidation     etc.   interface IFieldValidation      string ValidationMesagegetset     bool Validateobject value   class PhoneNumberValidation  IFieldValidation      public string ValidationMesagegetset     public bool Validateobject value                 var validated  true lets say...         var innerValue  string value         validate innerValue using Regex or something         if validation fails, then set ValidationMessage propert for logging.         return validated        class EmailValidation  IFieldValidation      public string ValidationMesagegetset     public bool Validateobject value                 var validated  true lets say...         var innerValue  string value         validate innerValue using Regex or something         if validation fails, then set ValidationMessage propert for logging.         return validated       codepre

Negative 3610 pI am trying to connect to a computer through a socket in c.

When codesleepcode is not there, the program works and continually tries to connect to the socket but there is no delay so it wouldnt connect anyway. I really need the delay to work.p  pCould anyone please helpp

Negative 3610 pIm trying to conceptualise a network analysis problem and figure out where to start in terms of analysis techniques in R. Apologies as Im fairly new to all this.p  pBasically, I have a network 1022 vertices and 9171 edges which is a hyperlink network of different websites. I want to know if I start at a random vertex in the network emuem, how many hops i.e. clicking on hyperlinks will it take to get to from emuem to my chosen vertex emvem.p  pHence, if I iterate this say 1000 times each with a random assignment of emuem, it might provide some kind of diagnostic around how reachable emuem is. I could then run this on different networks, to see compare reachability of a particular type of vertex emuem.p  pIn less abstract terms I am analysing government websites and the hyperlink networks they are part of. So Im trying to compare different websites in terms of their reachability in the network  i.e. whos more reachable I understand there is a wealth of network analysis techniques out there, but Im at a loss where to start really...p

Negative 3610 pI have a homework assignment that reads as follows dont flameworry, I am emnotem asking you to do my homework p  blockquote   pWrite a program that sorts a set of numbers by using the Quick Sort method using a binary search   tree. The recommended implementation is to use a recursive algorithm.p blockquote  pWhat does this mean Here are my interpretations thus far, and as I explain below, I think both are flawedp  blockquote   pA. Get an array of numbers integers, or whatever from the user. Quicksort them with the normal quicksort algorithm on arrays. Then put stuff into a binary search tree, make the middle element of the array the root, et cetera, done.p      pB. Get numbers from the user, put them directly one by one into the tree, using standard properties of binary search trees. Tree is sorted, all is welldone.p blockquote  pHeres why Im confused. Option A does everything the assignment asks for, except it doesnt really use the binary tree so much as it throws it last minute in the end since its a homework assignment on binary trees. This makes me think the intended exercise couldnt have been A, since the main topics not quicksort, but binary trees. p  pBut option B isnt much betterit doesnt use quicksort at all So, Im confused.p  pHere are my questionsp  ol lipif the interpretation is option A, just say so, I have no questions, thank you for your time, goodbye.pli lipif the interpretation is option B, why is the sorting method used for inserting values in binary trees the same as quicksort they dont emseemem inherently similar other than the fact that they both in the forms Ive learned so far use the recursion divideandconquer strategy and divide their input in two.pli lipif the interpretation is something else...what am I supposed to do pli ol

Negative 3610 pIve recently been reading a lot about font icons, and just about every site I see uses the codebeforecode and codeaftercode pseudoelements in combination with the codecontentcode property to insert font icons into the DOM.p  pHowever, I dont see the advantage of using these pseudoelements for font icons. In fact, I feel like there are two big disadvantages to using them codebeforecode and codeaftercode are not supported in IE7 and below, and it can be hard to position content using them.p  pAs such, my question is this Why use codebeforecode and codeaftercode at all to insert font icons into the DOM I was thinking that maybe it has something to do with screen readers, but nowadays, all font icons services like IcoMoon seem to allocate the font icons to code points in the Unicode PUAs Private Use Areas, which from what I hear, are not read aloud by screen readers anyway.p  pTo me, it seems much easier and more crossbrowser compliant to simply add the font icons to the markup using HTML entities like codeampxE000code.p  pTo rephrase the question What are the specific reasons why most people use codebeforecode and codeaftercode for font icons Thank you very much.p

Negative 3610 pI have a div with webkitoverflowscrolling set to touch. On iOS this then gives me an updated position during the touchmove event, but once the user lets go this event ends and a final call to touchend is made before events all stop, but the div continues to momentum scroll.p  pThis is the behaviour I want, but I also want to update the page during this momentum scrolling.p  pI trigger a call to requestAnimationFrame when the touchend event happens, and I can loop this while the momentum scroll occurs. But when I get DOM information, its frozen until after the mometnum scroll ends.p  pIve tried using both the scroll position of the scrolling element and elementFromPoint, but both just have the position the scrolled div was in at the time touchend was triggered, and dont update until the momentum scroll ends.p  pDoes anyone know of any way to get real time DOM information on iOS 6, not worried about 5p  pHeres some code Im usingp  precodevar glideStart var birdscanner  document.getElementByIdbirdscanner birdscanner.addEventListenertouchend,function      glideStart  null     requestAnimationFrameglide   function glidetimestamp       if we need to reset the timestamp     if glideStart  null               glideStart  timestamp            determine if weve moved     var birdscanner  document.getElementByIdbirdscanner      console.log document.elementFromPoint337,568        calculate progress keep running for a very long time so we see what happens when momentum ends     var progress  timestamp  glideStart     if progress lt 10000               requestAnimationFrameApp.Controller.bird.glide       codepre  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAfter a stronglotstrong of attempts at this, I think it really is impossible without using some library to try and mimic the momentum scroll instead of using the built in option something I find never really gives as smooth results. Apple are clearly very worried about things interfering with their momentum scroll animation and preventing it rendering properly.p  pI ended up removing the momentum scroll and just detecting swipes and moving through a bunch of elements at once when thats triggered.p  pI did notice some particularly strange behaviour. When I had webkitoverflowscrolling touch set on an element that was scrolling the page updown and added a setTimeoutsomefunc,0 to the touchend event, the function wasnt triggered until the momentum scroll ended. When I tried the same thing on a scroll going leftright it triggered the function straight away. No clue why this happens, decided it must just be some strange webkit quirk.p

In my case I am looking to resizedownscale the image based on a maximum size.p  pAs an example, I would like to set a maximum codeNSDatacode size to be 500 KB. I know that I can get the size of the image like this Check the size of the image returnedp  precodeNSData imageData  UIImageJPEGRepresentationimage, 0.5   Log out the image size NSLoglu KB,imageData.length1024 codepre  pWhat I would like to do is some form of loop here.

If the size is still too large scale down again slightly then check again, until it is lower than the maximum set size.p  pI am not sure what the best approach for this is. Ideally I do not want to scale down the image to a specific size all the time, but only slightly scale down the image each time.

Negative 3610 pIm trying to use pregmatchall to check for syntax errors with comma, where hello, there is ok but not hello,there. p  pFirst I realize that a space, double quote, and line break are all acceptable after a comma, so I believe I can do  codepregmatchall,[ rn], mystring, resultcode and anything returning means theres a syntax error.p  pThen I realize commas also appear in numbers, eg. 1,234,567, so I need to allow 3digit numbers in my regex. If Im purely searching for a 3digit number, I know I can do     codepregmatchalld3, mystring, resultcodep  pBut in this case I want to emexcludeem 3digit numbers, ie. the regex should say match all that have a comma followed by something NOT space, NOT line break, and emNOT a 3digit numberem. The and NOT a 3digit number part threw me off I thought I could just do      codepregmatchall,[ rnd3], mystring, resultcode but that doesnt seem to be it. What did I do wrong here And is there a simpler way to accomplish this searchp

Negative 3610 pI ran into a bit of a roadblock when writing a child class constructor..p  pIn my program I have an codeentitycode class which describes a generic object in the game. It has members that everything will have, such as position, sprite image, an object name, etc.p  pThere is a child class called codecreaturecode that inherits from codeentitycode, describing any kind of living objectthing in the game, the player, monster, what have you.p  pcodeentity.hcode has the constructorp  pcodeentityint a, int b, int c, string n, char dcode, explicity creating an entity at codea,b,ccode with name codencode and display character codedcode.p  pcodecreaturecode inherits codeentitycode, and the aforementioned constructor. Although it has several other things that need to be initialized, namely the creatures stats that takes its own code block to describe.p  p.., codecreature.hcode has the constructorp  pcodecreatureint a, int b, int c, string n, char d  entitya,b,c,n,d  codep  pHowever, when I go to write codecreature.cppcode, and write the implementation for this constructor to initialize the stats, I cannot get passed a redefinition  previously defined error. My first guess was to remove the brackets at the end but then I get codeexpected  at end of inputcode. The only temporary solution I found was to write the implementation in the   of the codecreature.hcode file, but thats not the practice I want to observe here of course.p  pWhat is the correct syntax to do this The only examples I could find from digging around write the definition and implementation in the same set of code p

Negative 3610 pAsking this question here because a hrefhttpcs.stackexchange.comcs stack exhangea has only 50 followers for Computer Networks tag and has no tag for TCPp  pAt a particular national level examination, for postgraduate university admissions in my country, the following question was askedp  pWhile opening a TCP connection, the initial sequence number is to be derived  using a timeofday ToD clock that keeps running even when the host is down.  The low order 32 bits of the counter of the ToD clock is to be used for the initial  sequence numbers. The clock counter increments once per millisecond. The  maximum packet lifetime is given to be 64s. p  pWhich one of the choices given below is closest to the minimum permissible rate      at which sequence numbers used for packets of a connection can increase p  precode A 0.015s B 0.064s C 0.135s D 0.327s codepre  pThe answer apparently is B 0.064sp  ul liNormally, TCP strongmaximumstrong connection speed is governed by the packet lifetime. If you use 32 bits  for the sequence number, then the numbers will get repeated after 232 counts, because of wrap around. li liIf you send a packet with number X, then after 232 bytes are sent, the number X will get reassigned to some other packet. When the second packet with number X enters the connection, the first one shouldnt be in the network to avoid duplication. So sequence numbers should strongnotstrong be repeated strongbeforestrong a packet lifetime.li ul  pemThatem governs the emmaximumem rate.p  pHowever, as asked in the problem, we need to find the emminimumem rate.p  pbtw, even if sequence numbers are changed once in every 64 seconds 1 seq no. in 64 seconds , then the number of sequence values in 1 second  164  0.015...which is option A, but thats not the correct answer either , apparently.p  pMy questionsp  ol liWhat factor governs the minimum rate in general, or in this particular questionli liWhy 0.064s, as in what happens if sequence numbers change slower than that How to solve this question to arrive at 0.064s li ol  pI know its more of a theoretical question, but it has been really nagging me for a long time..  Any help is highly appreciated. including proof that this question andor the answer is wrong. The only reason this question is worth pondering over, is that it was asked in an important and highly valued  nationwide examination.p

Negative 3610 pIve got a preview tool that  when the user selects an orientation, relays out the screen to have a wider landscape or higher portrait preview window containing a generated image.p  pWhat I would like to happen is.. p  ul liUser selects a new orientation say Landscapeli liThey see a loading gif for say 500msli liWhilst they see a loading gif, the preview window resizes to the correct dimensionsli liThen the new generated image appears in the preview panelli ul  pHere are two snippets from a PrintPreviewer object which are at the heart of the issue, updatePreview and resizePreviewWindow.p  pThe problem is that both of these functions were trying to use the css method to insert a new backgroundimage into the preview area. When I tried to add a loading gif to the step in resizePreviewWindow, unfortunately, the loader gif was never shown. So instead, I have now opted below to simply remove the preview background image temporarily. I need to do this, because if the old bg image remained in the preview panel whilst the new correctly ratiod image was generated, it looks very odd for about 200ms as the resizePreviewWindow function does its work. p  pA This already feels rather clunky as a way to switch orientations for the user. Although this works, I feel it could do with some tidying up and DRYing out, and would appreciate some guidance.p  pB I was hoping that Id be able to use a loading gif in the time it takes updatePreview to point to the server at printspreview and display in the preview panel whilst the new generated image is fetched and streamed into place.p  precodevar PrintPreviewer        init function           var data  this.cleanForm          this.updatePreviewdata         this.selectBoxUpdate         this.changeColor         this.changeTextarea         this.changeStyle     ,       removed some code for clarity      updatePreview function data          var preview  preview         preview.fadeInslow, function              preview.attrpreviewpreface,              preview.cssbackgroundimage,urlprintspreviewdata             console.logdata              ,      removed some code for clarity      resizePreviewWindow function elem       when user selects new orientation put correct shape window     var prevSurr  previewSurround     var prev  preview      switch elem.val           case landscape         prevSurr.removeClassportrait square.addClasslandscape         prev             .css             backgroundimage none,                          .animate             height 380px,         , 100          break     case portrait         prevSurr.removeClasslandscape square.addClassportrait         prev             .css             backgroundimage none,                          .animate             height 540px,         , 100          break     case square         prevSurr.removeClassportrait landscape.addClasssquare         prev             .css             backgroundimage none,                          .animate             height 420px,         , 100          break     default         console.loghi         codepre

Negative 3610 pI have a NSOpenGLView object within a floating NSPanel of which I render an image using glDrawPixels. Everything works fine until the window gets resized. Ive prevented resizing by returning a fixed size when the resize function of the NSPanel object is called, but when the cursor click is on the edge of the window and attempts to resize the window, the window doesnt resize but after holding on for a few seconds, the automatic update for the OpenGL view stops getting called.p  pBelow are a simplified list of stepsp  ol lidrawRect called automaticallyli liUser attempts to resize window click amp drag for a few secondsli lidrawRect stops getting called automatically. setNeedsDisplay or [openglcontext update] in the reshape function doesnt helpli ol  pMy OpenGLContext is setup with the following formatp  precodeNSOpenGLPFANoRecovery, NSOpenGLPFAWindow, NSOpenGLPFAAccelerated, NSOpenGLPFADoubleBuffer, NSOpenGLPFAColorSize, 24, NSOpenGLPFAAlphaSize, 8, NSOpenGLPFADepthSize, 2, NSOpenGLPFAStencilSize, 8, NSOpenGLPFAAccumSize, 0, 0 codepre  pWithin drawRectp  precodeglClearColor0, 0, 0, 0 glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT [[self openGLContext] makeCurrentContext] glOrtho0, self.frame.size.width, 0, self.frame.size.height, 1, 1 glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW glLoadIdentity glDisableGLDEPTHTEST  Drawing code here.

The problem to the above solution isnt a graceful one but it works. I basically disabled the window style mask that enables the resize mask.

Negative 3610 pI have two small userdefined subroutines that I have implemented in the finite element software ABAQUS they define two special types JTYPE1,2 of multipoint constraint MPC in my finite element model. These subroutines are written in FORTRAN 6677 as required and are compiled at runtime by ABAQUS using the Intel FORTRAN Compiler. I have verified that they compile and work correctly.p  pHowever, I can only use one of these subroutines at a time in my model. This is because they must both use the following name and arguments in order for ABAQUS to know when to call them and how to use themp  precode      SUBROUTINE MPCUE,A,JDOF,MDOF,N,JTYPE,X,U,UINIT,MAXDOF,       LMPC,KSTEP,KINC,TIME,NT,NF,TEMP,FIELD,LTRAN,TRAN codepre  pIt turns out, however, that I need to be able to simultaneously use both types in a given analysis. Since JTYPE, which is specified for each of the many MPC instances used in my finite element model, is either 1 or 2, the ideal solution is to combine my currently separate subroutines, and switch between the two types inside this new subroutine. I figured that I could do this using an emIFJTYPE .EQ. 1 THENem type syntax.p  pThe problem is that the required blocks of code differ for each JTYPE, even though they are both SUBROUTINE MPC. For my first subroutine JTYPE1, the manual requires the         following interfacep  precode      SUBROUTINE MPCUE,A,JDOF,MDOF,N,JTYPE,X,U,UINIT,MAXDOF,       LMPC,KSTEP,KINC,TIME,NT,NF,TEMP,FIELD,LTRAN,TRAN C       INCLUDE ABAPARAM.INC C       DIMENSION AN,JDOFN,X6,N,UMAXDOF,N,UINITMAXDOF,N,       TIME2,TEMPNT,N,FIELDNF,NT,N,LTRANN,TRAN3,3,N         user coding to define A, JDOF, and, optionally, LMPC         RETURN       END codepre  pFor the second subroutine JTYPE2, the manual requires the following interfacep  precode      SUBROUTINE MPCUE,A,JDOF,MDOF,N,JTYPE,X,U,UINIT,MAXDOF,       LMPC,KSTEP,KINC,TIME,NT,NF,TEMP,FIELD,LTRAN,TRAN C       INCLUDE ABAPARAM.INC C       DIMENSION UEMDOF,AMDOF,MDOF,N,JDOFMDOF,N,X6,N,       UMAXDOF,N,UINITMAXDOF,N,TIME2,TEMPNT,N,       FIELDNF,NT,N,LTRANN,TRAN3,3,N         user coding to define JDOF, A and, optionally, LMPC         RETURN       END codepre  pThe important difference is that the dimensions of the A and JDOF arrays are different for each type.p  pI had hoped to get around this by declaring these variables inside the IF loop, as followsp  precode      SUBROUTINE MPCUE,A,JDOF,MDOF,N,JTYPE,X,U,UINIT,MAXDOF,       LMPC,KSTEP,KINC,TIME,NT,NF,TEMP,FIELD,LTRAN,TRAN C C     CUSTOM MULTI POINT CONSTRAINT C       INCLUDE ABAPARAM.INC C       DIMENSION AN,JDOFN,X6,N,UMAXDOF,N,UINITMAXDOF,N,       TIME2,TEMPNT,N,FIELDNF,NT,N,LTRANN,TRAN3,3,N,       A2MDOF,MDOF,N,JDOF2MDOF,N,UEMDOF C       IF JTYPE .EQ. 1 THEN       DIMENSION AN,JDOFN,X6,N,UMAXDOF,N,UINITMAXDOF,N,       TIME2,TEMPNT,N,FIELDNF,NT,N,LTRANN,TRAN3,3,N,       A2MDOF,MDOF,N,JDOF2MDOF,N,UEMDOF         A1  1.

Negative 3610 pIn Woocommerce, I have many products in about 8 different categories.  When users purchase items, the email that is sent to them lists the products in the order that they added them to their cart which appears very chaotic.

Negative 3610 pI am having some problems understanding the concept of component instantiation in iPOJO. I read a hrefhttpfelix.apache.orgdocumentationsubprojectsapachefelixipojoapachefelixipojouserguideapachefelixipojoinstances.html relnofollowthis guidea and I get the analogy to classes and objects but I still have some concrete problems and some conceptual problems that I hope someone can clarifyp  pI thought I needed to create instances via iPOJO emInstantiateem or factories strongonlystrong for service providers since they never use emnewem because the impl is always hidden. However, I have some consumers emComponentem that I instantiate myself say in a main method where I call emnewem on them directly. I made them emComponentem because they need to have things injected. I was assuming that the ipojo bytecode manipulation would make it so that when the objects were constructed, they would have their dependencies injected Im using mostly method injection with emBindem but it seems that is not the case. Can someone clarify this to me please. Now it seems to me that for iPOJO to do any injection at all I need to always use one of the iPOJO instantiation techniques. The problem I have is that then the constructors I made in the consumer classes are not called.p  pThis is a simplified example to illustrate my confusionp  precodeComponentnametest public class MyFoo      private ListltExternalgt externals injected     private Bar bar passed via constructor. Bar is not a Component      public MyFooBar otherBar          bar  otherBar         externals  new ArrayList           Bindaggregatetrue     public addExternalExternal service          externals.addservice       codepre  pSo, as can be seen here, I need to have all the providers of interface codeExternalcode, but I also need a codeBarcode object that I pass when I construct the object using codenew MyFoosomeBarcodep  pMy problem is that if I need to pass a codeBarcode to the constructor then I need to use emnewem but If i use emnewem, iPojo never invokes my injection method. On the other hand, if I use iPOJOs instantiation say I add Instantiate then the injection does happen but the constructor is not invoked, so the bind throws a NPE because the list has not been created yet  bar will not be set. I know I can create the list inside the bind method, but my question is more conceptual. p  ol liHow are you supposed to accomplish this framework injection  argument passing in the constructor li liHow can iPOJO be calling addExternal which means the object has been created without calling my one and only constructor that creates the object this is very counterintuitive in standard javali liAre you just not supposed to use constructors when using iPOJO components maybeli ol

Negative 3610 pWe develop an application that is supposed to run on both PCs and Android mobile phones. Some of the code should be shared on both platforms. As both versions make heavy use of databases native SQLite on the PC and the builtin SQLite DBs on Android, I was wondering whether there is a good way to write code that accesses both these databases through the same API. p  pMy question is about the preferred way to develop such code. There are ways to use a native SQLite DB on the Android phone, then obviously the code would be identical. The second option would be to develop a small library that has an AndroidDatabaseAdapter and an SQLiteDatabaseAdapter which both implement a common interface and essentially just forward the respective calls. But since I guess that Im not the first person to have such a problem, I was wondering whether there already exists such a library. Unfortunately, my Google and SO search did not reveal any such library that is slim and does not already come along with ORM and lots more features which I consider as overhead for our purpose.p

Negative 3610 pI load some obj. and .mtl files and I create and add some object in the scene. I put them in an array, so I can detect when they re clicked succesfully.  intersectObjectsobjs,true p  pAlthough, when I create simple circle meshes and put them in an array so I can detect them, detection does not fully work. Very difficultly intersectObjects detects my clicks on the circles needs 45 clicks on average.p  pThe strange thing is that when I press F12 and I open the Developer Tools and then I close it or not,does not matter, everything works perfectly and the circles are easily detected. Very strange. I think something is wrong with intersectObjects. It seems to me that it does not handle well the meshes.p  pPiece of code because project is big and complicated a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu100222836code.js relnofollowhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu100222836code.jsap  pNote I think couple of days ago console put out an error message relate to the .getDescendants function of the Three.js file in the IntersectObjects function.p  pstrongEDITstrong  p  pstrongAn other odd thing that happens is that before I open the developer tools, I click next to a circle  the empty space at the left of a circle and it detects the click as if I had clicked the circle itself the circle in the right of the empty space changes color as expected by the click see pic where I click strong a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms0gqb6iovon8c665Screenshot20201405152015.51.18.png relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.coms0gqb6iovon8c665Screenshot20201405152015.51.18.pnga . p  pstrongAfter I opened the Tools, it does not detect the clicking in the empty space at the left of a circle.

Negative 3610 pWith a friend of mine, we disagree on how synchronization is handled at userspace level in the pthread library.p  pa. I think that during a pthreadmutexlock, the thread actively waits. Meaning the linux scheduler rises this thread, let it execute his code, which should looks likep  precodewhile mutexresourcegtlocked codepre  pThen, another thread is scheduled which potentially free the codelockedcode field, etc.  So this means that the scheduler waits for the thread to complete its emschedule timeem before switching to the next one, no matter what the thread is doing.p  pb. My friend thinks that the waiting thread somehow tells the kernel Hey, Im asleep, dont wait for me at all. In this case, the kernel would schedule the next thread right away, without waiting for the current thread to complete its emschedule timeem, being aware this thread is sleeping. p  pFrom what I see in the code of pthread, it seems there is loop handling the lock. But maybe I missed something.p  pIn embedded systems, it could make sense to prevent the kernel from waiting. So he may be right but I hope he does not D.p  pThanksp

However, when I attempt to access ANY of the 57 files, including the FMServerSample file, I get errors.p  pusing the following php, I get an error returned of 959, which according to FileMaker is that the CWP service is not running. An entry IS being created in the FileMaker Server log, so I know its hitting the server. If I point it at any of the 4 other servers, I get correct results. But I am baffled on this one.p  precodeltphp  requireonceFileMaker.php requireonceConfig.php   fm  new FileMakerFMServerSample, 127.0.0.1, Admin, 12345 request  fmgtnewFindAllCommandEnglishFormView result  requestgtexecute if FileMakerisErrorresult      echo FileMaker server error  . resultgtmessage .  . resultgtcode .   else      records  resultgtgetRecords     foreach records as r          echo rgtgetFieldTitle       codepre
Negative 3610 pIm trying to utilize Vagrant 1.6s Docker provider and I seem to have run into a snag.

Negative 3610 pI have a function in Javascript that Exports data to a new Excel file. Im using ActiveXObejctExcel.Application to work with Excel.

Negative 3610 pThere is something that I dont entirely understand when it comes to mutating value types in Swift.p  pAs the The Swift Programming Language iBook states  strongemBy default, the properties of a value type cannot be modified from within its instance methods.emstrongp  pAnd so to make this possible we can declare methods with the codemutatingcode keyword inside structs and enums.p  pThe thing that is not entirely clear to me is this You can change a var from outside a struct, but you cannot change it from its own methods. This seems counterintuitive to me, as in Object Oriented languages, you generally try to encapsulate variables so they can only be changed from within. With structs this appears to be the other way around. To elaborate, heres a code snippetp  precodestruct Point      var x  0, y  0     mutating func moveToXx Int, andY yInt  Needs to be a mutating method in order to work         self.x  x         self.y  y        var p  Pointx 1, y 2 p.x  3 Works from outside the struct p.moveToX5, andY 5  codepre  pDoes anyone know the reason why structs cannot change their content from inside their own context, while the contents can easily be changed elsewherep

Negative 3610 pI have a B2C application coded in Symfony2. Users arrives on my homepage and then signup. Once signup, my application authenticate this user, using the Authentication of Symfony 2. The authentication is persistent, so after the signup the user will be loggedin forever.p  pBut my users can interact with my application not only directly under my domain there are websites, partners of my application, that allows their users to interact with my application. During this, the user remains inside the pages of the third party website.p  pIn order to make this possible Ive created, in Symfony, a set of API that allows third party websites to interact with my application. The API calls are made by Jquery.p  pHere comes my question would my Symfony Controller who replies to API Calls, be able to recognize if the user who is on the third party website which is doing the API call is loggedin on my application or notp  pI tried to check thisp  pifthisgetsecurity.contextisGrantedROLEUSERp  pBut it always replies me with false.p  pIf the API Call would have been made by PHP, I know it would be impossible. But it is made in JavaScript, so from the client the user. Thats why I think I would be able to recognize if the client who is calling my API from a third party website, is already loggedin on my application.p  pThanksp

Negative 3610 pVery soon I will be building a database structure that will contain 2 million rows. Generally there are no more than 200 rows queried per minute and of those 200 itll be 1020 of those rows that are being queried.p  pGiven the size of the table, Id like to store the queried row somewhere so that any other end users querying this row will be able to get the row data quicker. I then want this row to be accessed via this for a while and then put back into the main table once its no longer in use. I believe this will make access quicker and more efficient.p  pUsing the below schema, Ill provide an example. In this case row 1 has been accessed from the application layer. The application layer queries the accessed table to see if the row is there. If it is, it uses this and updates the accessed table with any changed data. If it isnt, it is queried from the main large table and dropped into the accessed table until the cron runs say 10 minutes later when all accessed data is copied into the main table and deleted from the accessed table.p  pa hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com2d76f62 relnofollowhttpsqlfiddle.com2d76f62ap  pIm trying to work out the followingp  p1 Will this show an increase in efficiency I would imagine each query against accessed instead of the main will be significantly fasterp  p2 What technology should be used for the accessed data storage Its likely the main table will be stored in MariaDBMySQL, however Im happy to run it in flat files, sqlite, a different instance or keep it within the same instance... Im open to suggestions that will make this more efficient, and in theory theres no reason the application layer couldnt act as an intermediary between any technologiesp

Negative 3610 pIm writing some code in visual basic which uses the interop functionality with Microsoft Excel. Im getting frustrated with the way the point unit of measurement works and the fact that translating inches to points will not yield accurate results for both vertical and horizontal cell dimensionsIt changes them by drastically different amounts. There is a page layout view under the views tab in the excel application proper and I am looking for a setting for an Excel.Workbook or Excel.WorkSheet object that will do the same thing as this essentially in that it will change the units with which things like the ColumnWidth and RowHeight are measured to be in inchesor better yet something like millimetres. p  pDoes anyone know of a setting in the Excel interop which would do thisp  pThanks, any help or clarifications would be appreciated.p

Negative 3610 pIm working with a 3rd party library Autodesk Revit whose API requires that all calls take place on the main thread.  So, in order to create a progress window to provide information on the status of running commands, Ive been forced to create a window on a new thread. Running the logic in a BackgroundWorker or on any other sort of background thread is unfortunately not an option.p  pFor reference, Im targeting the .NET Framework version 4.5, and using WPF with an MVVM pattern.p  pEverything works properly, UNLESS I click anywhere in the window at any point when its visible.  If I leave the window alone, all properties and both progress bars are correctly updated, and the window closes as expected at the end.p  pIf I click anywhere in the window, it locks up completely  progress bars stop updating, no properties are updated, I cant move it, etc. No exceptions are thrown and there is nothing to indicate that there is an issue.  Eventually, once the command completes, a  System.Threading.Tasks.TaskCanceledException exception is thrown presumably on the window Close call.br The window remains open because the call to close it was never received and becomes updated with the final values that it should have had before closing.  Observing the window in Spy, I can see that all of the clicks and mouse events that should have taken place while the window was frozen are received all at once.p  pI hope somebody out there has an idea of whats going on, Im totally stumped...p  pHere is the call stack before clicking in the windowbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYwxOQ.png altCall Stack Before Clickp  pAnd the call stack after

The autoforms now creates me the form and I am able to do stuff with it. p  pBut whats the problem here  The problem is the codeparentcodevalue. Its type is codeStringcode and because of this selecting  none  is not possible. But I want that the field codeparentcode in the database has a codebooleancode value codefalsecode when no parent is given.p  pThe question is now how to solve this.p  pIs it better  and possible  to give a value 2 or more types  If not it must be necessery to overwrite the value after or before isnerting to the collection  but this also does not work because the simpleSchema do deny this process.

Negative 3610 pIm developping a windows form application in managed C, compiled for AnyCPU using Visual Studio 2008 and .NET3.5.brbr When debugging on a 32bit PC, everything works fine.brbr When debugging on a 64bit PC, the app crashes due to an access violation that occurs within a 3rd party 32bit native DLL, part of a USB camera API, that I wrapped into a managed DLL. The native function call that fails has only one int32 argument, which is correctly initialized. That API call being the first one, I can see in the debugger output window that it correctly triggers the loading of the native 32bits DLL and all its dependencies from the SysWoW64 directory.brbr I precise that I dont have access to the source code of the native DLL which is provided with minimum documentation and no support by the camera manufacturer.brbr My question is twofoldbrbr 1  Apart from a buggy native DLL, what could explain the different behavior we observe for the same 32bit app running on a 32bit or a 64bit machine brbr 2  Although I know it may sound as bad design, Id like to catch the access violation to prevent that DLL call from leading to an app crash. Indeed, the app manages many different instruments so it should rather catch and signal the error rather than abruptly stop its execution because of only one instrument. So I tried to put the native dll call first within a strongemtrycatch blockemstrong, then using a strongemtryexcept blockemstrong with the SEH compiler option, but I cant seem to catch the error the program always terminates at the native function call. Even when the debugger does catch it by selecting access violation in emDebugExceptionsem, it doesnt pass it on to the app and my handler block is never reached... I spent hours searching SO for similar issues but, although I did find nice posts on the SEH, I couldnt find the solution to this one. Any idea  Did I miss something with the SEH brbr Thanks for your help.p

Negative 3610 pIm already using codespin.jscode in my application. I like it because its pure codeJScode and at least for me solved some issues that I was having using a loading image. However the default behaviour has two things that I would really like to change.p  pHere is a simple a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netL7d3soja relnofollowFiddle examplea which is simple but very well illustrates what I would like to achieve.p  pI have a very long from and at the beginning of the codeHTMLcode file I have codeltdiv idshowspinnergtltdivgtcode so when the user clicks codeSubmitcode I canp  precodevar target  document.getElementByIdshowspinner var spinner  new Spinner.spintarget codepre  pThe problem is that when Im at the end of the form where the codesubmitcode button is when I call the spinner it shows in such a way that I may very well not see it at all, as it is in my codeFiddlecode example at least if you are using some lowlaptop resolution but no matter the resoution theres always the chance to get so down below that you cant actually see that the spinner is shown. Which kinda leads me to the nex problem which I think is realted to the first  I would like to show the spinner always at the center of media screen the laptop display for example and also  since for example I dont want the user to be able to click codeSubmitcode twice and in I would say, all of the cases, when I show the spinner I would like the user to not be able to interact with the codeUIcode  I mean, to click buttons, write stuff in inputs and so on so I would like to show some sort of load mask or Im not sure how its called, just like when you call codealertcodep  pSo to sum it up  from what is it right now in my fiddle example I would like to change it to some codealertcode like behaviour so that no matter where I am on the codeHTMLcode dom I always get some sort of spinning animation on the center of my screen and mask diasbling the user to interact with the codeUIcode.p  pSince this sounds to me as kind of trivial task, or at least something that have been solved already I would accept answer pointing to plugin that provide such functionality. The only thing  I woul prefer to use something that is pure JS and doesnt use images.. but I will apreciate all suggestionsp

Negative 3610 pSay I have a program that does a lot of file system operations, and I want to see what accesses are occurring in order to improve that program. What are good tools for recording the file system access stats So things like which files have been accessed, total readwrite bytes by file, total readswrites counts.p  pThanks.p
Negative 3610 pIm using HttpURLConnection in Android and I would like to know how to completely close it. There is disconnect function but in documentation I found that it not necessary closes connection. Indeed when I dop  precodeadb shell netstat lptu codepre  pI see my connection and disconnect does nothing. On the other hand if I close my app and remove it from background the connection is dissapears so I feel that there is a way.p  pIm not interested in advices like its better to let connection reusing because tests I need to pass are checking that connection was not closed and are failing. I cant modify test tools so I need to completely close the connection.p

Negative 3610 pWe have developed a custom checkin policy plugin that traps the checkin events to TFS 2013 on the client. This is used to evaluate certain workflow statuses and generate a meaningful comment for the checkin. For these tasks the Work item selected  associated by the user for the checkin is inspected for validity, and values from the work item are used to generate the comment. This works perfectly in the Visual Studio realm. Until recently all checkins to TFS were done via Visual Studio 2013. A new team joined us and they make use of XPA Magic. The standard XPA editor seems to makes use of the 32bit MSSCCI provider for TFS 2013 to perform check outs and checkins on TFS.  When checking in code via the XPA editor, the following dialog is used to allow the user to select  associate his work item and add comments.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comreuqy.png altenter image description herep  pUnfortunately when checkingin via this dialog, the functionality does not work anymore.  I have debugged the plugin project and when checking OUT via this route, the Evaluate function is called and exposes the Microsoft.VisualStudio.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.PendingChanges.PendingChangesModelVS . However when checking IN, the Evaluate function is NOT called.p  pemIs it conceptually possible to also trap the checkin events and achieve the same or similar results as when checking in via Visual Studioemp  pClient machines have Visual Studio Premium 2013 running on Windows 7 connecting to a TFS 2013.Update3 application server.p  pp  pp  pHey Edward,p  pI am not entirely sure that I am interpreting your reply correctly, but here goes  p  pThe idea is to build an comment containing the details from the associated work item Like the WI number, description and some other custom information at checkin time. After checking in the files the comment of the change set created, will then contain some useful information .  The comment strings is generated on the checkin and then set in the following property  PendingCheckin.PendingChanges.Comment  newCheckinCommentp  pFull NameSpace Microsoft.VisualStudio.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.PendingChanges.PendingChangesModelVS.PendingCheckin.PendingChanges.Commentp  pWe thus need to push the comment in here during the checkin action. At checkin we also know for sure that there is at least one WI associated from where the data can be distilled, as this is enforced.p  pIn debug I see the following events firing every time when these actions are undertakenp  ul liOn a Refresh within Team Explorer. PendingCheckin.Policies.EvaluationState  Unevaluatedli lipOn a Checkout via the Context menu  Team Foundation Server in Windows Explorer. PendingCheckin.Policies.EvaluationState  Unevaluatedpli lipOn a strongCheckinstrong with Visual Studio PendingCheckin.Policies.EvaluationState  strongEvaluatedstrongpli ul  pSeeing that we are only interested in the checkin action, the code only responds to  PendingCheckin.Policies.EvaluationState  Evaluatedp  precode    public override PolicyFailure[] Evaluate              PolicyFailure[] failures  null          if PendingCheckin.Policies.EvaluationState  PolicyEvaluationState.Evaluated               InitConfiguration             failures  CheckWorkitemStatus             if Util.ArePolicyFailuresOkfailures                 failures  ComposeCheckinComment             if Util.ArePolicyFailuresOkfailures The setting of the comment gt PendingCheckin.PendingChanges.Comment  newCheckinComment , happen in this function.                 failures  CheckFilesToCheckin                  return failures      codepre  pSo as you can see the problem arises that the checkin via the Context menu  Team Foundation Server in a Windows Explorer, never reaches the Evaluate function, but the checkout from the same Context menu does  Hope it makes sensep

Negative 3610 pI am currently dealing with a performance issue where I cannot find a way to fix it. I want to search a text for usernames mentioned with the codecode sign in front. The list of usernames is available as PHP array.p  pThe problem is usernames may contain spaces or other special characters. There is no limitation for it. So I cant find a regex dealing with that. Currently I am using a function which gets the whole line after the codecode and checks char by char which usernames could match for this mention, until there is just one username left which totally matches the mention. But for a long text with 5 mentions it takes several seconds  to finish. for more than 20 mentions the script runs endlessly.p  pI have some ideas, but I dont know if they may work.p  ol liGoing through username list could be 1.000 names or more and search for all Username without regex, just string search. I would say this would be far more inefficient.li liChecking on writing the usernames with JavaScript if space or punctual sign is inside the username and then surround it with quotation marks. Like User Name. Dont like that idea, that looks dirty for the user.li liDont start with one character, but maybe 4. and if no match, go back. So same principle like on sorting algorithms. Divide and Conquer.

Negative 3610 pI have an Android OpenGLES application featuring two threads. Call Thread 1 the display thread which blends its current texture with a texture emanating from Thread 2 a.k.a the worker thread. Thread 2 performs offscreen rendering render to texture, and then Thread 1 combines this texture with its own texture to generate the frame which is displayed to the user.p  pI have a working solution but I know it is inefficient and am trying to improve upon it. In its OnSurfaceCreated method, Thread 1 creates two textures. Thread 2, in its draw method, does a glReadPixels into a ByteBuffer lets refer to it as strongbbstrong. Thread 2 then signals to Thread 1 that a new frame is ready, at which point Thread 1 invokes glTexSubImage2Dstrongbbstrong to update its texture with the new data from Thread 2, and proceed with its blending in order to generate a new frame.p  pThis architecture works better on some Android devices than others, and I have been able to garner a slight improvement in performance by using PBOs. But I figured that by using socalled direct textures via the EGL Image extension a hrefhttpssoftware.intel.comenusarticlesusingopenglestoaccelerateappswithlegacy2dguis relnofollowhttpssoftware.intel.comenusarticlesusingopenglestoaccelerateappswithlegacy2dguisa I would gain some benefit by removing the need for the costly glTexSubImage2D call. Yes, Id still have the glReadPixels call which bothers me still but at least I should measure some improvement. In fact, at least on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S Mali T628 GPU my new code is dramatically emslowerem than before How can this bep  pIn the new code Thread 1 instantiates the EGLImage object by using gralloc and proceeds to bind it to a texturep  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecode note gbuffercreate is a wrapper around gralloc buffer  gbuffercreatewidth, height, gbufferFORMATRGBA8888 EGLClientBuffer anb  buffergtgetNativeBuffer EGLImageKHR pEGLImage  eglCreateImageKHReglGetCurrentDisplay, EGLNOCONTEXT, EGLNATIVEBUFFERANDROID, EGLClientBufferanb, attrs glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, texid  texid from glGenTextures... glEGLImageTargetTexture2DOESGLTEXTURE2D, pEGLImagecodepre div div p  pThen Thread 2 in its main loop does its offscreen rendertotexture stuff and essentially pushes the data back over to Thread 1 via glReadPixels with the destination address as the backing storage behind the EGLImagep  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodevoid vaddr  buffergtlock glReadPixels0, 0, width, height, GLRGBA, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, vaddr buffergtunlockcodepre div div p  pHow can this be slower than glReadPixels into a ByteBuffer followed by glTexSubImage2D from the aforementioned ByteBuffer Im also interested in alternative techniques as I am not limited to OpenGLES 2.0 and can use OpenGLES 3.0. I have tried FBOs but ran into some issues.p  pIn response to the first answer I decided to take a stab at implementing a different approach. Namely, emsharingem the textures between Thread 1 and Thread 2. While I dont have the sharing part working yet, I do have Thread 1s EGLContext passed down to Thread 2s EGLContext so that in theory, Thread 2 can share textures with Thread 1. With these changes in place, and with the glReadPixels and glTexSubImage2D calls remaining, the app works but is far slower than before. Strange.p  pThe other oddity I uncovered is the deal with the difference between javax.microedition.khronos.egl.EGLContext and android.opengl.EGLContext. GLSurfaceView exposes an interface method setEGLContextFactory which allows me to pass Thread 1s EGLContext to Thread 2, as in the followingp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodepublic Thread1SurfaceView extends GLSurfaceView    public Thread1SurfaceViewContext context      supercontext      here is how I pass Thread 1s EGLContext to Thread 2     setEGLContextFactorynew EGLContextFactory        Override       public javax.microedition.khronos.egl.EGLContext createContext         final javax.microedition.khronos.egl.EGL10 egl,         final javax.microedition.khronos.egl.EGLDisplay display,         final javax.microedition.khronos.egl.EGLConfig eglConfig             Configure context for OpenGL ES 3.0.           int[] attriblist  EGL14.EGLCONTEXTCLIENTVERSION, 3, EGL14.EGLNONE           javax.microedition.khronos.egl.EGLContext renderContext               egl.eglCreateContextdisplay, eglConfig, EGL10.EGLNOCONTEXT, attriblist           mThread2  new Thread2renderContext               codepre div div p  pPreviously, I used stuff out of the EGL14 namespace but since the interface for GLSurfaceView apparently relies on EGL10 stuff I had to change the implementation for Thread 2. Everywhere I used EGL14 I replaced with javax.microedition.khronos.egl.EGL10. Then my shaders stopped compiling until I added GLES3 to the attribute list. Now things work, albeit slower than before but next I will remove the calls to glReadPixels and glTexSubImage2D.p  pMy followon question is, is this the right way to handle the javax.microedition.khronos.egl. versus android.opengl. issue Can I typecast javax.microedition.khronos.egl.EGL10 to android.opengl.EGL14, javax.microedition.khronos.egl.EGLDisplay to android.opengl.EGLDisplay, and javax.microedition.khronos.egl.EGLContext to android.opengl.EGLContext What I have right now just seems ugly and doesnt feel right, although this proposed casting doesnt sit right either.

Negative 3610 pI have some code Im trying to unit test and from what I can tell, its simply not possible. There are several questions similar to this, some of which incorrectly claim to solve this problem however none them can actually test my product code. Below is a sample of the important linesp  precode            WebRequest req  WebRequestWebRequest.Createurl             WebResponse resp  WebResponsereq.GetResponse             HttpWebResponse httpResp  HttpWebResponseresp              if httpResp.StatusCode  HttpStatusCode200                              log.ErrorString.FormatRecieved non200 status 0, httpResp.StatusCode                 return defaultT  defaultT  null for all reference types              codepre  pIn the above code, the commented out block is what should actually be in my product. The two lines above it Ive had to use in its palce to make it unit testable.p  pMy mock for unit testing is based my the example a hrefhttpblog.salamandersoft.co.ukindex.php200910howtomockhttpwebrequestwhenunittesting relnofollowherea which says it mocks codeHttpWebResponsecode but in fact mocks codeWebResponsecode. From what I can tell its not possible to mock the codeHttpWebResponsecode because its constructors have both been deprecated... Here is an example modifying the code from that blog postingp  precodeclass TestWebReponse  HttpWebResponse      Stream responseStream       ltsummarygtInitializes a new instance of ltsee crefTestWebReponsegt      with the response stream to return.ltsummarygt     public TestWebReponseStream responseStream              this.responseStream  responseStream            ltsummarygtSee ltsee crefWebResponse.GetResponseStreamgt.ltsummarygt     public override Stream GetResponseStream              return responseStream       codepre  pHowever the above will not compile due to the codeHttpWebResponse does not have a constructor that takes 0 argumentscode error. Does anyone have a work around for this that employs a similar mechanism for intercepting the product codes request but is capable of returning an codeHttpWebResponsecode Mocking codeWebResponsecode just simply isnt very useful for these types of applications no rest consumer should be using codeWebRequestcodecodeWebResponsecode in favor of codeHttpWebRequestcodecodeHttpWebResponsecode and this is the point at which I must test so using Moq or a similar utility to make one of my methods return the object is not an option, as it would just circumvent the code Im trying to test which to be clear is two things is my request valid and do we correctly deserialize the response. So the only restriction for answers is that the test code needs to remain similar to thisp  precodestring response  JsonConvert.SerializeObjectexpected WebRequest.RegisterPrefixtest, new TestWebRequestCreate TestWebRequest request  TestWebRequestCreate.CreateTestRequestresponse  var client  new FakeProprietaryHTTPClient PropietaryDataType res  client.MakeRequestThatReturnsDeserializedPropietaryDataType  do asserts against that PropertaryDataType codepre
Negative 3610 pI am working with a trial copy of the current version of Cloud Zoom. You can see my test page at a hrefhttpwww.vici.comactuatest.php relnofollowhttpwww.vici.comactuatest.phpa . I have it configured to zoom to the full larger photo on a mouseclick. I was not particularly happy that on a touch device, I had to leave my finger on the small image to keep the large photo open, so I tried adding permaZoomtrue feature. This would be ideal if I could set the large photo to close on an additional click or touch  or at least be able to close it by clicking or touching a Close window link in the caption. I suspect this is possible, but Im pretty clueless. Any help, pleasep

Negative 3610 pThis is related to a recent thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29376714updateprogresswithmrprogress2937733729377337Update progress with MRProgressa. I converted my cloudkit queries from the convenience API to CKOperations as a result of previous thread Thanks Edwin. So while using CKModifyRecordsOperation to save a record, I can see the records progress via logging in the perRecordProgressBlock, which is great. However, Im trying to send this progress back to the viewcontroller and I cannot figure out how to do that. I have created a class for all of my CloudKit methods  CKManager. The other problem Im having is that Im unsure when to update the progress indicator using MRProgress framework in the VC. Do I call it before, during or after the save operations call in the CKManager Should it be called recursively until the progress  1.0 Here is the code I have so far...every works fine except for updatinganimating the progress indicator it appears and shows 0 and then disappears when the save operation is completed. Also, Im using a property double progress in my CKManager class and I know that is incorrect, but I wasnt sure how else to do it. And I do not feel that the callback method Ive declareddefined in my CKManager class below for this is correct either.

Negative 3610 pHi I am very new to android development and so require your help. I am using google places api to get a list of places around a user. Based on this list, I want to send push notifications to users. I have written the code for this function and it is working properly. However, how can I make this function run continuously even when the app is closed  For example, lets say this function is called collectsendnotification. I want this particular function to run every 15 minutes in the background even if the user had closed the app. I am sure this is possible but need some guidance. Thank you. p

Bonus internet points if anyone knows why codeexecvecode takes a codechar  const code instead of a codechar const code as its second argument.p  pstrongEdit Editstrong To clarify, the difference between the constsp  pcodechar  const code  makes the contents of the array immutable codechar const code  makes the contents of the string buffers pointed to by the array immutable.p  pConst always constifies the thing to the left, unless it appears first the ANSI C guys need shooting for that in which case it constifies the thing on the right. Although many people write codeconst char code, its considered best practice by some, to write codechar const code because then application of the const is consistent.p  pYou cant cast away a const without receiving a warning from the C compiler. memcpy is the only way to work around this without warnings.p  pMany older libraries dont correctly mark arguments to their functions as const, and if you have applied const correctly to types in your code, the compiler will emit warnings. That is why using memcpy is occasionally acceptable.p

Negative 3610 pThe following lines of code returns two different outputs on two different servers A and Bp  precodeecho dateM Y, strtotime201501 echo dateM Y, strtotime201502 codepre  pThe expected output is Jan 2015 and Feb 2015 which is correct on the server A. p  pBut the same code on server B returns the output as Jan 2015 and Mar 2015. p  pOn debugging, I found that the codestrtotimecode function on server B is always returning the timestamp for the current day of every month today is 29th, which explains why 201502 is shown as March 2015 since there is no Feb 29, 2015.

Negative 3610 pBackground Im trying to write a graphics library for python built on top of Tkinter. I therefore would like to abstract all of Tkinters functionality from the user and have method calls that modify the root window sequentially in a Processinglike manner. e.g my library lets call it mylib would enable you to write code like thisp  precodefrom mylib import  this would be my library window400, 400 open a new window to add objects to colorred set the color of all subsequent items to red circleradius5, centerx  0, centery0 make a red circle line10,10, 20, 20 red line going from 10, 10 to 20, 20 colorblue line50, 50, 100, 100 blue line codepre  pI thought of implementing it like thisp  precodetry     from tkinter import  except     from Tkinter import   root  Tk   class MyCanvasCanvas     def initself, width400, height400         master  Toplevelroot         Canvas.initself, master, widthwidth, heightheight         self.pack         self.items  []         self.width  width         self.height  height         root.mainloop   global c c  None  def window     c  MyCanvas     c.pack  def linea,b,c,d     config code goes here     c.createlinea,b,c,d  test window line10, 10, 50, 50 codepre  pThat didnt work because Python wouldnt get out of mainloop so I tried this instead     try         from tkinter import      except         from Tkinter import p  precoderoot  Tk   class MyCanvasCanvas     def initself, width400, height400         master  Toplevelroot         Canvas.initself, master, widthwidth, heightheight         self.pack         self.items  []         self.width  width         self.height  height    global c c  None  def window     c  MyCanvas     c.pack  def linea,b,c,d     config code goes here     c.createlinea,b,c,d     root.updateidletasks  test window line10, 10, 50, 50 codepre  pBut that didnt work too  it just froze. And I tried replacing updateidletasks with update. The window froze again. How do I use update properlyp  pIs there a way to accomplish this using mainloop without having the user explicitly call itp  pOr is there a way to edit widgets in mainloop I thought about using after but I didnt see how that would solve the problem.p  pIf no answer exits given these constraints would writing the package in PyOpenGL be useful or portable  Should I write the module using C from scratch Does anything else exist Help mep  pSorry for the long question.

Negative 3610 pHello I have the code below. Essentially, it grabs unique values of a certain range in each worksheet and adds it to a range on the side of the same worksheet. p  pThe .find method is not working for me like it does in another procedure and I would like an explanation why or what I am doing wrong or the difference between the behavior of the code when written differently. make sensep  precode    sub methodtwo      Dim cell As Range     Dim strDATE As String     Dim datehr As Range       For i  1 To Sheets.Count  4         Sheetsi.Activate         Set datehr  Sheetsi.RangeH2, Sheetsi.RangeH2.EndxlDown                 For Each cell In datehr                         strDATE  cell.Value                         Set cell  Sheetsi.RangeL1L400.FindWhatstrName                              If cell Is Nothing Then                                 Sheetsi.RangeL1.EndxlDown.Offset1, 0.Value  cell                              End If                  Next cell         Next i      End Sub codepre  pbelow is the code I have written before and a reference for writing the code above. In the code below, the find method works perfectly and adds unique values to the designated range...the code above does not.p  precodeSub methodone  Dim sh As Worksheet Dim r As Long Dim a As Range Dim al As Range Dim strName As String  For Each sh In Worksheets     sh.Activate     sh.RangeK1.Activate     Set al  ActiveSheet.RangeA2A13000          For Each a In al                 strName  a.Value                 Set Cell  ActiveSheet.RangeK1K400.FindWhatstrName                      If Cell Is Nothing Then                         ActiveSheet.RangeK1.EndxlDown.Offset1, 0.Value  a                      End If          Next a  Next sh   End Sub codepre  pI wanted the methodtwo to do the exact same thing as methodone except on the last 4 sheets.p  pIs the problem obvious Im working on my attention to detail..especially when using a previously written code for reference.p

And I always tend to favor the former, despite the nesting, because of the single return statement. I feel that nesting can sometimes be defeated by other refactoring, but sometimes I do end up with a method that doesnt make sense to be broken up and has truefalse blocks with nontrivial code in each of them. It is in these situations that Im not sure what to favor from a design perspective.p  pSo the question here really is strongat what level does nesting become unacceptablestrongp  pIs it ever acceptable beyond a single level I think, because its the way we write our firstpass of logic, it is looked at as being lazy and thoughtless to have a lot of nesting. On the other hand, nesting is necessary at points, but can seemingly always be unrolled into a flatter statement and, just like any other refactor, this concept can be over applied. So the follow up question is strongwhat is the fine balance between overlynested code and overly flattened codestrongp  pProviding backing resources such as coding guidelines docs, professional posts, articles, etc will certainly help substantiate your opinion. The reason Im asking these questions is because I havent found enough resources to back either side of this argument.p  pHopefully this question is found to be useful by others, and thank you in advance for your help.p

Negative 3610 pI have a bit of a problem regarding a large database with many different names for the same company. Basically, what I have to do is find all the names representing Company X and change them to X.p  pThis way, if the detailed name is X SL or Shipment Regarder ASL or oubiyubib2 and we know that all three represent company X, Id have to look for them and change them by hand. Theres also something called NISA thats meant to represent the sector the company is in, since sometimes the one that comes in the files Im to process are wrong.p  pTo solve this, I created an excel that stores all known names for the various companies and then replaces the names on the list accordingly. The structure of the stored data goes like thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comQDSww.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQDSww.jpg altCapturaa So in the first column theres the NISA and the second one has the generic name for the company, while on the columns following that are the known names for the company. The whole name lists are alphabetized by the column with a 1.p  pThen, theres INDICE which details the row where the first instance with the three letter combination appears. This way, the first name starting with 3SU is in row 28. INDICIE 2 is to detail the first letter in INDICE, so an index of an index. Meaning that the first row in INDICE starting with an A would be in row 39.p  pThe main reason for all this is because the database quickly grew to contain over 25K rows and over a hundred columns in some instances, and because sometimes 3MSA is an entirely different company than 3MSL, the thing has to go word for word checking over which itd be its appropriate generic name.p  pSo the bulk of the code goes like thisp  precodeDim listRow As Long, searchRow As Long Dim searchedName As String, genericName As String Dim problem As Boolean problem  False listRow  2 searchRow  2 searchedName   genericName    Do While CellslistRow, colmnNames ltgt      searchedName  UCaseCellslistRow, colmnNames     searchRow  0     This part compares if its looking again for the same name.

If it gets outside the starting 3 letter combination, it stops and returns 0, otherwise, itll return the row where it found the match             If searchRow gt 0 Then                 CellslistRow, colmnResults  CellssearchRow, B                 CellslistRow, colmnRestNisa  CellssearchRow, A             Else                 GoTo NotFound             End If         Else NotFound               CellslistRow, colmnResults  searchedName             CellslistRow, colmnRestNisa  CellslistRow, colmnSectores             CellslistRow, errorsA  searchedName             CellslistRow, errorsB  CellslistRow, colmnSectores             CellslistRow, erroresC  Not Found             problem  True This is so therell be a popup at the end of the loop.

Negative 3610 pIm currently tinkering with a scenario for using CoreOS. Its probably not the 1st class use case. But Id like to get a pointer if its valid though. As Im really at the beginning of getting a grip on CoreOS I hope that my use case is not totally off.p  pImagine a multi tenant application where every tenant should get its own runtime environment. Lets take a web app running on Node.js and PostgreSQL for data storage as given. Each tenant environment would be be running on CoreOS in their respective containers. Data persistance is left out for now. For me its currently more about the general feasibility.p  pSo why CoreOSp  pCurrently I try to stick with the idea of separated environments per tenant. To optimise the density of DB and web server instances per hardware host I thought CoreOS might be the right choice instead of classic virtualisation.p  pAnother reason is that a lot of tenants might not need more than a single, smallish DB instance and a single, smallish web server. But there might be other tenants that need some constantly scaled out deployments. Others might need a temporary scale out during burst times. CoreOS sounds like a good fit here as well.p  pOn the other side there must be a scalable messaging infrastructure RabbitMQ in behind that will handle a lot of messages. This infrastructure will be used by all tenants and needs to dynamically scalable at best. Probably there will be a to be scaled Elasticsearch infrastructure as well. Viewed through my current CoreOS for everything goggles this seems a good fit as well.p  pIn case this whole scenario is generally valid, I currently cannot see how it would be possible to route the traffic for a general available web site to the different tenant containers.p  pImagine the app is running at app.greatthing.tld. A user can login and should be presented the app served for its tenant. Is this something socketplane andor flannel are there to solve Or how would a solution look like to get the tenant served by the right containers I think its kind of a general issue. But at least in the context of a CoreOS containerized environment I cannot see how to deal with this at all.p

Negative 3610 pI have a WPF application where I have functionality to read data from Excel. I was doing this using OLEDB and it was working great, until I found out there was a 255 limit for columns and the data would be truncated unless data  255 characters is not present in the first eight rows.

Negative 3610 pI am downloading 43 stock symbols historical pricing into excel 2013.  my code uses a 2d array which is then transposed and inserted into a sheet.  It works fine, until I try and download pricing going back to 1990 for the 43 symobls.  It seems that once the second dimension of the array gets over a certain amount the cell value turns to NA as some point down column one.

Negative 3610 pI have a dataset with unknown number of clusters and I aim to cluster them. Since, I dont know the number of clusters in advance, I tried to use densitybased algorithms especially DBSCAN. The problem that I have with DBSCAN is that how to detect appropriate epsilon. The method suggested in the DBSCAN paper assume there are some noises and when we plot sorted kdist graph we can detect valley and define the threshold for epsilon. But, my dataset obtained from a controlled environment and there are no noise. p  pDoes anybody have an idea of how to detect epsilon Or, suggest better clustering algorithm could fit this problem.p
