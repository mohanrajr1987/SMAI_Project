Positive 1188 h2My Setuph2  pIm currently running 2 instances of WildFly 9.0.0.CR1 on a Linux machine.p  pI have install scripts that set everything up. It creates a codesimstandalonecode folder in addition to the existing codestandalonecode folder and copies in a codesimstandalonefull.xmlcode file this file offsets the port number by 100.p  pThey are both installed as services under codeetcinit.dwildflycode and codeetcinit.dsimwildflycode, with codesimwildflycode being tweaked to use a different configuration file it points to the codesimstandalonecode folder and uses the codesimstandalonefull.xmlcode file instead of codestandalonecode and codestandalonefull.xmlcode.p  hr  h2My Questionh2  pThe only issue Im having now is that both codewildflycode and codesimwildflycode are using the codeJBOSSHOMEbinstandalone.shcode file to run. This causes issues because codeJBOSSBASEDIRcode points to the codestandalonecode folder, causing the logs to overlap and the deployments to be read from that folder for both instances.p  pMy current solution is to create another codestandalone.shcode file and change the codeJBOSSBASEDIRcode to the codesimstandalonecode folder however, I would like to know if there is a way to set codeJBOSSBASEDIRcode in one of my existing files without having to create another codestandalone.shcode file. I tried setting it in codesimwildfly.confcode since there are many other variables in there, but that didnt work.p  pAny help would be appreciatedp  hr  pstrongEDITstrong So my codeetcinit.dsimwildflycode script runs codestandalone.shcode. It sets the script by settingp  precodeJBOSSSCRIPTJBOSSHOMEbinstandalone.sh codepre  pIm trying to set it to p  precodeJBOSSSCRIPTJBOSSHOMEbinstandalone.sh Djboss.server.base.dirJBOSSHOMEsimstandalone codepre  p...but that doesnt seem to be working. It says that codeDjboss.server.base.dirJBOSSHOMEsimstandalonecode is not a file or directory when I run codesystemctl status simwildflycode. I tried wrapping it in quotes as well. What am I missingp
Positive 1188 pIve inherited some java code that uses the JBoss Logging implementation explicitly.  I know that this is normally configured as a JBoss Subsytem, and Im able to observe various log tuning operations just fine when running on the server.  However, Im not getting any log message output for unit tests.  Ive dropped several configuration files on the test classpath to includep  ul lilogging.propertiesli lilog4j.xmlli lilog4j2.xmlli ul  pbut have not seen any results.  Has anyone been able to configure the JBoss Logging system such that theyre visible outside of the container in unit tests  Is this even possible  The a hrefhttpsdocs.jboss.orgauthordisplayAS72LoggingConfiguration relnofollowlogging configuration guidea didnt speak to how to do this.p

Positive 1188 pI am trying to configure a security domain for my JBoss EAP 6 application in which the primary means of authentication will be a Smart Card, but in the absence of the card will accept LDAP authentication. I have been able to do either one, but not both. The password stacking option is supposed to allow each module to be run, to allow the LDAP module, for instance, to retrieve the roles even when the Certificate module has returned the user identity. However, the applications web.xml needs to specify a loginconfig with an authmethod. In the case of Certificate, this is CLIENTCERT, and with LDAP its BASIC. Has anyone found a way to allow both of these modules to be chained together successfully My standalone security domain looks like thisp  precode    ltsecuritydomain nameMySecurityDomain cachetypedefaultgt ltauthenticationgt     ltloginmodule codeCertificate flagrequiredgt         ltmoduleoption namepasswordstacking valueuseFirstPassgt         ltmoduleoption namesecurityDomain valueMySecurityDomaingt         ltmoduleoption nameverifier valueorg.jboss.security.auth.certs.AnyCertVerifiergt     ltloginmodulegt     ltloginmodule codeLdapExtended flagrequiredgt         ltmoduleoption namepasswordstacking valueuseFirstPassgt         ltmoduleoption namejava.naming.factory.initial valuecom.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactorygt         ltmoduleoption namejava.naming.security.authentication valuesimplegt         ltmoduleoption namejava.naming.provider.url valueldapmy.fully.qualified.domain389gt         ltmoduleoption namebindDN valueFULLYusernamegt         ltmoduleoption namebindCredential valuemypasswordgt         ltmoduleoption namebaseCtxDN valueCNUsers,DCfully,DCqualified,DCdomaingt         ltmoduleoption namebaseFilter valuesAMAccountName0gt         ltmoduleoption namerolesCtxDN valueCNUsers,DCfully,DCqualified,DCdomaingt         ltmoduleoption nameroleFilter valuemember1gt         ltmoduleoption nameroleAttributeIsDN valuetruegt         ltmoduleoption nameroleAttributeID valuememberOfgt         ltmoduleoption nameroleNameAttributeID valuenamegt         ltmoduleoption nameallowEmptyPasswords valuefalsegt     ltloginmodulegt     ltloginmodule codeorg.picketlink.identity.federation.bindings.jboss.auth.RegExUserNameLoginModule flagoptionalgt         ltmoduleoption nameregex valueCN.,gt     ltloginmodulegt     ltloginmodule codeDatabase flagrequiredgt         ltmoduleoption namepasswordstacking valueuseFirstPassgt         ltmoduleoption namedsJndiName valuejavajbossdatasourcesmyDSgt         ltmoduleoption namerolesQuery valueselect role, Roles from Principal where namegt     ltloginmodulegt ltauthenticationgt ltjsse truststorepasswordmykeypass truststoreurljboss.server.config.dirtruststore.jks clientauthtruegt ltauditgt     ltprovidermodule codeLogAuditProvidergt ltauditgt codepre  pp

Positive 1188 pIm trying to replace the default session manager to use Object Grid.  Although this post is in a hrefhttpsdeveloper.jboss.orgthread220840 relnofollowreferencea to AS 7.11 its been my only guide thus far.  Based on Pauls instructions, I believe I have been successful in registering my implementation of codeorg.jboss.as.clustering.web.DistributedCacheManagerFactorycode because I see the print statements I have in its constructor in the console.  I have also added additional print statements to methods within my implementation.  Namely, codestartcode, codestopcode, and codesessionCreatedcode.  To test this I created a sample web application that creates a new session using codeHttpServletRequestgetSessiontruecode.  I dont see these statements in the console.p  pWhat else should I be doing to have my implementation usedp
Positive 1188 pAll. I am very new to jboss and resteasy.p  pI am having a trouble with finding a tutorial for integrating JBoss JAAS into Resteasy JAXRS. p  pI would like to provide two restful APIs in resteasy application one is used for loggingin and the other one is for loggingout. p  pin the loggingin method, I would like to create a LoginContext object with user credentials from the request and call its LoginContext.login method to authenticate the user. After that, set a cookie on the request. I dont really know if this is possible, I know I can createmodify cookie header with resteasy, but I am not sure about if its possible to convert that LoginContext to a session id p  panother solution I can think of is to create a session id and keep a mapping between that session id with LoginContext. However, that would significantly increase complexity of the resteasy application which I would like to avoid. it also doesnt make sense if there is no conventional way to automatically bind these information to a web sessionp  pAny suggestionssolutions are welcome. a sample code or tutorial would be much appreciate. p  pemI am using is JBoss AS 6 and resteasyjaxrs2.1.0.GA.jar.em p

Positive 1188 pI have a JBoss application which has Oracle DB based password authentication using org.jboss.security.auth.spi.DatabaseServerLoginModule. This application is running on the older community edition jboss6.1.0.Final. I would like to throttle failed login attempts.  I figure that these may come in a couple of waysp  ol liA username which exists in the database has repeated failed password attemptsli liAttempts are made with usernames likely machine generated that do not exist in the database li ol  pI am currently only concerned with 2. p  pThis server is behind a reverse proxy, which would make tracking the IPs attempts come from difficult.p  pAfter a few fruitless hours of Googling I am none the wiser about how to implement logic whereby, in the case of 2, the failed attempts may be logged and some sort of lockout takes place. Another thought I had was that maybe a lockout isnt necessary, and instead implement some sort of CAPTCHA system. Again, I find no good resources on how to implement this within my current authentication scheme.p  pWhat are the suggested practices to deal with thisp
Positive 1188 pWe defined a data source for Oracle in standalone.xml.Instead of defining the username and password tags in the standalone.xml as we dont know the values, requirement is we need to get the username and password from .orapwd file .p  pWe are provided with the path of the password file.orapwd file. I found that we can define security domain in standalone.xml with module option where we pass value of file path.

Negative 1188 pHave you used the Perl 5.10 backtracking control verbs in your regexes yet And what problems did they help you accomplish p  hr  pJust as background I have done some fiddling, but I cant get any really useful results.p  pAs a comparison, when I started getting what the codegtcode grouping did, it started showing up more in my regexes. I liked the idea of tuning the world of Perl regex to a particular set of assumptions. As RE languages get more featured, the backtracking has made the performance of REs wildly divergent from the lean and mean FSA that they were based upon. p  hr  pWhen someone can tell me what emotherem implementation of REs has backtracking control verbsand PCRE emdoes notem, I can concede that it belongs in the general area of expertise of people knowledgeable about regexes. This is a emPerlem regex question, and guys helping people out with Ruby, Python, C, Javascriptor any PCRE client implementations probably cant help or see it as a waste of space for the tags they normally read.p

Negative 1188 pI recently upgraded one of my applications to Rails 2.2.2.  Having done that, Ive encountered a strange performance bug that has caused renders that used to complete in a fraction of a second to take up to 10 seconds.p  pIve profiled the issue, and a hrefhttpcompucatedsolutions.comjmcrailsprofileflat.txt relnofollowhere are the results Ive come up witha.  It looks like the issue is in the coderealconnectcode method of the Mysql class.  My understanding is that the Ruby coderealconnectcode method is a wrapper around the C codemysqlrealconnectcode function.  This would lead me to believe that the issue must be with the database, since Ive encountered the same problem when running the code on Windows and Linux the database server is a separate system.  I dont, however, believe this is the case, because when I roll back to a previous version pre Rails 2.2.2 from my subversion repository, the performance issue goes away.

Negative 1188 pI thought Id post here in the hope that maybe someone with MVVM expertise would be able to offer opinions on whether the following is a good ideap  pIm using Sacha Barbers Cinch MVVM framework, which includes Marlon Grechs SimpleCommand class.p  pOne thing this class doesnt have which some other alternatives have is a Text property, which can be commonly used to bind UI elements to the Title of the command operation.  Consequently Ive been writing an extension to this class which exposes a Text property.p  pNow, what Ive run into is a use case where Im using a command to toggle connectivity to a device.  Theres a bunch of different ways I could implement this arent there always  its software.  One way would be to expose multiple command objects from my ViewModel  one for Disconnect and one for Connect have the view model expose a property which indicates the connection state IsConnected and have the view conditionally bind to either the Connect command or Disconnect command.  My reaction to this option though, is ... yuckp  pWhat I initially started looking at instead was not only providing a Text property but also having the command object implement INotifyPropertyChanged so that the text property can be dynamically altered by the viewmodel to Connect or Disconnect according to system state.  Doing this, I can avoid having multiple commands and just expose a single ToggleConnection command object.p  pStarting down this path though, it occurs to me that there may be other variations of this pattern whereby the UI needs to be altered according to command state.  For example, in addition to changing the commands text according to connection state, you may have places where an icon needs to change according to connection state.  So, I started writing a Stateful class which implements INotifyPropertyChanged, and exposes two properties  Text and State.  Ive made the class generic so that the type of State can be defined by the user I usually prefer not to use object where avoidable.p  pThe question I have is... Do you think this is a good or bad idea  It may be diverging from the original intention  design of commands From what Ive seen it may in general be the case that command objects were intended to be stateless as they are the verbs of the system.  With routed commands, if I understand things correctly only the target of the command would usually be expected to have state.  Particularly since the same command could be routed to different handlers depending on where command bindings are declared.p  pSo, Im thinking that at least with routed commands, state would not make sense.p  pHowever, Im not dealing with routed commands  Im specifically dealing with MVVM commands.  In this case there basically is no conditional routing of commands  the MVVM views bind directly to a particular viewmodels command objects and its execute and canexecute handlers.p  pIn this case, does it make sensep  pIve attached a copy of the code in question, in case its of useinterest.p  pThanks, Philp

Through debug logging, it appears that the codeUIControlEventTouchDragExitcode event is the one to intercept though it doesnt fire until the touch is around 100 pixels away from the button, but that is not important to this question.p  pIdeally, when the drag exit event is fired, the button would stop receiving touch move events, the CustomView would get a codetouchesBegancode event even if I need to fake one myself somehow, and all future touch events codetouchesMovedcode, etc would be sent to the CustomView.p  pI have tried the following, and it doesnt have any effectp  precodevoidbtnTouchDragExitidsender      UIButton  btn  sender     [btn resignFirstResponder]     [customView becomeFirstResponder]  codepre  pI think the underlying codeUITouchcode object which is consistent across touch events is not being retargeted to point at the CustomView.

Negative 1188 pThe following question is inspired by a hrefhttpajaxian.comarchivesjquerybondage relnofollowthis blog entrya at ajaxian.com and a hrefhttpajaxian.comarchivesjquerybondagecomment276284 relnofollowthis comment by paul irisha.p  pHere is a way to declare live event. p  precodeli a.live... codepre  pAs per a hrefhttpwww.neeraj.nameblogarticles882howlivemethodworksinjquerywhyitdoesnotworkinsomecaseswhentouselivequery relnofollowthis blog entrya, it is my understanding that live events are nothing but a catch all at the document level. Any event that bubbles all the way to the top are caught by live events and if the selector is matching then the function is invoked.p  pIt is my understanding that on document ready if I invokep  precodeli a.liveclick, .. codepre  pthen all jQuery should do is to put the literal selector li a in memory somewhere. Now when a click happens and if that click bubbles all the way to the top then live should check what is the target element. If the target element satisfies the rule of li a then the function should be fired otherwise ignored this bubbled up event.p  pBased on that presumption on document ready when I am callingp  precodeli a.liveclick, .. codepre  pthen ideally jQuery should not actually go looking for all the element matching li a because jquery does not do anything with those elements. I know for sure that the elements that are currently present in the document matching li a are not bound to any event handler. p  pIf all jQuery has to do is to put the literal li a at the document root level then why go looking for elements matching the criteria li a on document ready. But based on the comment link that I mentioned at the top, it seems jQuery actually goes about looking for element on document ready. p  pMy question is why should live method find all the li a methods when it is not going to do anything with them. I guess the live syntax should have been something likep  precode.liveli a, click, function codepre  pAm I missing something herep

Negative 1188 pI have a core data entity which has an exclusive one to many relationship with another entity.

An instance of the second entity can only be contained in one of the first entities.p  pI want to be able to remove all the contained entities from the first entity and then delete them. How should I do this Should I remove the relationship and then call deleteObject for each entity or will calling deleteIObject for each contained entity cause the relationship to be set correctly. If the second is true, can I just enumerate the contained entities and call deleteObject or should I first make a copy of the set if calling deleteObject for each objects severs the relationship this will modify the set which is not allowed in normal enumeration.p
Negative 1188 pI have set up SSRS on my localhost, and used BIDS to create a couple of reports on them.  They access data from the same SQL Server where the SSRS is deployed, and when I preview them they run fine.  Then I deployed them to my localhost SSRS and accessed them via the ReportManager web interface, again they ran just fine.  Finally I deployed them to my hosting providers SSRS.  Same deal good data connectivity and it looks great in the ReportManager.p  pThe first time I access them through the ReportManager on either system, it demands my username and password, which on my laptop is just my account logon and password.  For my hosting provider its my account logon for them.p  pMy problem is when I try to display a report using the ReportViewer control in ASP.Net.  Very often, when it tries to render I get a Bad Logon or 401 Unauthorized instead of my report.  After a lot of reading and pondering, I believe the problem is that I need to log on not to the SQL Server, but to the website web service where my reports are exposed.  Right now if I dont provide any credentials at all, I can get my local reports in the ReportViewer usually.  However, when I deploy the reports to a remote server, this doesnt work anymore.p  pAfter some research I created a class that implements IReportServerCredentials and tried using it to pass in the username and password, but this doesnt appear to work.  And it was confusing me whether these credentials are supposed to be for the data source or for the web service. p  pIf anyone could clue me in on how to get the ReportViewer to log in to the SSRS web service, Id much appreciate it.p

Negative 1188 pI have a singleton instance that is referenced throughout the project which works like a charm. It saves me the trouble from having to pass around an instance of the object to every little class in the project. However, now I need to manage multiple instances of the previous setup, which means that the singleton pattern breaks since each instance would need its own singleton instance.p  pWhat options are there to still maintain static access to the singleton To be more specific, we have our game engine and several components and plugins reference the engine through a static property. Now our server needs to host multiple game instances each having their own engine, which means that on the server side the singleton pattern breaks.p  pIm trying to avoid all the classes having the engine in the constructor.p  pstrongEditstrong The engines isnt guaranteed to be running on a unique thread.

Negative 1188 pIve spent my entire day researching this topic, so it is with some scattered knowledge on the topic that i come to you with this inquiry. Please allow me to describe what I am attempting to accomplish, and maybe you can either suggest a solution to the immediate question, or another way to tackle the problem entirely.p  pI am trying to mimic something related to how bXAMLb files work in bWPFb, where you are essentially instantiating an object tree from an XML definition. If this is incorrect, please inform. This issue is otherwise unrelated to bWPFb, bCb, or anything managed  I solely mention it because it is a similar concept..p  pSo, Ive created an bXMLb parser class already, and generated a node tree based on bObjectNodeb objects. bObjectNodeb objects hold a string value called btypeb, and they have an bstdvectorb of child bObjectNodeb objects. p  pThe next step is to instantiate a tree of objects based on the data in the bObjectNodeb tree. This intermediate bObjectNodeb tree is needed because the same bObjectNodeb tree might be instantiated multiple times or delayed as needed. The tree of objects that is being created is such that the nodes in the tree are descendants of a common base class, which for now we can refer to as bMyBaseb. Leaf nodes can be of any type, not necessarily derived from bMyBaseb.p  pTo make this more challenging, I will not know what types of objects might be involved in the tree, so I need to allow for new types to be registered with the factory.p  pI am aware of boosts factory. Their docs have an interesting little design paragraph on a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1430libsfunctionalfactorydochtmlindex.html relnofollowthisa pagep  pi o We may want a factory that takes some arguments that are forwarded to the constructor,br o we will probably want to use smart pointers,br o we may want several member functions to create different kinds of objects,br o we might not necessarily need a polymorphic base class for the objects,br o as we will see, we do not need a factory base class at all,br o we might want to just call the constructor  without new to create an object on the stack, andbr o finally we might want to use customized memory management.br ip  pI might not be understanding this all correctly, but that seems to state that what Im trying to do can be accomplished with boosts factory. But all the examples Ive located, seem to describe factories where all objects are derived from a base type.p  pAny guidance on this would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks for your timep

Ive thought of finding the maximum TableA ID and offsetting the second and third TableB IDs by the max and two times the max. The problem with that is I dont know how to store that maximum value between queries.p  p[Edit2] I think Ive got the answer, TableB will be completely empty at the start of this, so if I sort TableA in the INSERT SELECT statement above, the records that are inserted into TableB should be in the same order.

Negative 1188 pNOTICE Appericiate all the answers, thanks but we already have a sequence.. and cant use the UNIQUE contraints because some items need to have duplicates.. I need to handle this using PLSQL somehow, so based on some criteria using an if statement i need to ensure there is no duplicates for that.. And just to confirm, these identifiers are very customized with different types of string.. And for each set of string, we have a number taht counts up only for that string STRSTR and we have like hundreds of these STRSTR combinations and for each combination we have a  that counts up... And on top of these some STRSTR combinations are allowed to have duplicates.. So we CANT use UNIQUE CONTRAINTS, not can we use PRIMARY KEY as its not a simple number and on top of that we do have a PRIMARY KEY assigned to the each item.. These Identifiers are for the users and not for the database management. p  pWhen a user creates an item, based on some creteria, we give a certain number to the item.. In the save function, a function is called to prepare the first initial string, then the table where the numbers are kept is scanned and the next available 4 digit number for that particular string is assigned.p  pNow there is some issues with this, there is about 1000 lines of codes between getting the next number and the commit to the database. The issue is when 2 people create an item with the same criteria within seconds of each other, sometimes the same number is issued.p  pWhat ive done is that just before the commit, i check the database for the number and if it exist, i call the function to get the next available number again...p  pEven though this code decreased the chances of a duplictation, if i save 2 items exactly at the same time, i still get a duplicate number..p  pAnyone know any way to avoid duplicates and drop the chances of a duplicate number to a 0p  pEDIT1 We already have a primary key.. This identifier is a special string, and very customized, therefore it woudnt be possible to just use a number that counts up from 0p  pEDIT2 There is also some cases where we need duplicates.. this is very minor maybe about 10 different item tracks use duplicates so before i do my checks for duplicates before the commit with an if statment, so if the item saves dosnt belong to one of the systems that is supposed to have duplicates then, i skip the check...p  pEDIT 3 We are using PLSQL herep  pEDIT 4 I guess this problem was very specific and i didnt quite convey it so.. Although there were many answers, noone of them really captured my problem.. Regardless,i solved the problem and added below as my answer.. p
Negative 1188 pI am looking for a way to provide a ListSource to a TDBLookupComboBox in delphi without having an actual table on the database server to draw that list from. The DataField for the Combo Box is a 1 character field that contains a coded value such as A  Drivers License, B  Passport, C  Library Card, etc. That is to say that the table only contains A, B, or C. The application is responsible for Displaying Drivers License in the GUI. Normally a database might have a look up table but this database does not and I can not add one. My idea is that the DataSource and ListSource for a DB Lookup control do not have to be the same database, so if it were possible to define a small table in my form that contains the lookup data then I could use that an not require a real database table. p  pDoes anyone know of a delphi component that allows a TDataSet to be defined on a form without having any actual data files behind itp

Ajax stuff1 UpdateTargetId  fruits Ajax stuff2 UpdateTargetId  fruits  ltHtml.RenderPartialPagerAjax, PagerViewData[pager] gt  ltdivgt codepre  pnow this fruit control can appear on a number of webpages and the pager would need to know what page the user is on so that it can pull next set of fruits accordingly.  For example, if I am on redfruit page, then PagerAjax should know I am only pulling out red fruits. So, basically I would need to know ControllerName assume its home and actionName assume its redFruits.  Example may seem inefficient but it makes sense for the real purpose.

Negative 1188 pIs there a way to read a files data but continue reading the data on the hard drive past the end of file For normal file IO I could just use fread, but, obviously, that will only read to the end of the file. And it might be beneficial if I add that I need this on a Windows computer.p  pAll my Googling for a way to do this is instead coming up with results about unrelated topics concerning EOF, such as people having problems with normal IO.p  pMy reasoning for this is that I accidentally deleted part of the text in a text file I was working on, and it was an entire days worth of work. I Googled up a bunch of file recovery stuff, but it all seems to be about recovering deleted files, where my problem is that the file is still there but without some of its information, and Im hoping some of that data still exists directly after the currently marked end of file and is neither fragmented elsewhere or already claimed or otherwise overwritten. Since I cant find a program that helps with this specifically, Im hoping I can quickly make something up for it I understand that, depending on what is involved, this might not be as feasible as just redoing the work, but Im hoping thats not the case.p  pAs far as I can foresee, though I might not be correct not sure, which is why Im asking for help, there are 3 possibilities.p  pWorst of the three I have to look up Windows API functions that allow direct access to the entire hard drive similar to its functions for memory, perhaps those I have experience with and scan the entire thing for the data that I still have access to from the file and then just continue looking at whats after it.p  pSecond I can get a pointer to the file, then I still have to get raw access to HD but at least have a pointer to the file in itp  pBest of the three Just open the file for write access, seek to the end, then write a ways past EOF to claim more space, but first hope that Windows wont clean the data before it hands it over to me so that I get garbage data which was the previous data in that spot which would actually be what Im looking for This would be awesome if it were that simple, but Im afraid to test it out because Id lose the data if it failed, so hopefully someone else already knows. The PC in question is running Vista Home Premium if that matters to anyone that knows the gory details of Windows.p  pDo either of those three seem plausible Whether yea or nay, Im also open and eager for other suggestions, especially those which are better than my silly ideas, and especially if they come with direction toward specific functions to use to get the job done.p  pAlso, if anyone else actually has heard of a recovery program that doesnt just recover deleted files but which would actually work for a situation like this, and which is free and trustworthy, that works too.p  pThanks in advance for any assistance.p
Negative 1188 pcan anyone help me out with sharing a list between multiple python processes.

In order to know how much data ids are in process self.mpsinprocess is used nr processes is hardcoded here, but actually its dynamic.p  pThe problem is to share mpsinprocess and IDList across multiple processes. Current code goes into pretty much endless loop. What goes wrong is actually well described in multiprocessing libraryp  blockquote   pif code run in a child process tries to access a global variable, then the value it sees if any may not be the same as the value in the parent process at the time that Process.start was called.p blockquote  pHowever, Im not able to figure out how to get mpsinprocess and IDList working. I cannot use Queue, as the way elements are taken out from mpsinprocess is random. I cannot use Array, because .pop0 does not work. I cannot use Manager.list, because .remove and lenIDList do not work then. Using threading instead of multiprocessing is no solution, because later freezesupport must be used.p  pTherefore, any help how to share list among processes is very welcomep

Negative 1188 pGreetings again,p  pFollowing up my previous question, Im trying to maximize the compatibility of my Cwritten Windows Explorer extension.  In particular, Im interested in making sure it works in an environment in which .NET 4 is installed and .NET 3.5 and below are emnotem installed.  One would think theres no problem, but apparently its not so simple...p  pThere are two problems.  First, non.NET4targeted assemblies flat out strongwill notstrong load with CLR 4 unless they have a code.configcode file that specifies codeltsupportedRuntime versionv4.0 gtcode.  Even trying to use codengencode on them will fail without this code.configcode file.  But my DLL goes in the GAC.  How do I get a code.configcode file in there too  Others have asked the same thing, and reached the conclusion well, Ill just make a static Settings class instead.  Obviously I cant do that...p  pSecond problem When I register my DLL with coderegasm.execode, and then open up the registry to see what it wrote, I see codeRuntimeVersion  v2.0.50727code under its CLSID entry.  This also prevents the DLL from loading.  Only after I manually change the codeRuntimeVersioncode value to codev4.0.30319code does the DLL load.p  pSo what the heck do I have to make my installer do here  For the first one I have no idea.  For the second, I guess I have to have the installer set the registrys RuntimeVersion manually to whatever .NET version is installed  That seems too wacky to be true...p

But this would be a nice tool to have in other scenarios too.p

Negative 1188 pIn the good old days of regular OpenGL, it was fairly easy to determine if a texture upload was successful  after calling glTexImage2D you could use glGetTexLevelParameteriv with GLTEXTUREWIDTH and GLTEXTUREHEIGHT as parameters.  GLES, however, doesnt seem to allow this, and as far as I can tell has no mechanism to determine whether a texture has actually been successfully provided to the card for example, glGetError is only set for things that emwill notem succeed, as opposed to things that emdid notem succeed.p  pThe application Im working on is always straddling the barrier between having enough VRAM available and not and theres often a lot of dynamicallyallocated FBOs and the like flying around, complicating matters further, and if an important texture upload fails I need to know if I need to purge an unimportant texture and retry.p

Negative 1188 pIm working on improving the experience of a site by adding in iPad support. This includes support for videos. Our client is pushing towards a YouTube model for storing and serving videos  great for us I originally planned to implement the use of YouTubes new HTML5supporting codeltiframegtcode snippets. This offloads the device detection to YouTube and makes embedding a video a cinch as we dont need to worry about compatibility. It turns out the the CMS were using, a hrefhttpwww.sitecore.net relnofollowSitecore CMSa, strips out codeltiframegtcodes from our WYSIWYG editor. After a lot of research it looks like its a bit hard to not make this happen.p  pFast forward to now... I tested out the old style codeltembedgtcode code and discovered even though iOS doesnt support Flash, these embeds seem to work fine on iPad. Some Stack Overflow research led me to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2578807whydoesonlyyoutubeembedsworkonipad25788222578822this posta which suggests its because of the YouTube plugin codeSystemLibraryInternet PlugInsYouTubePlugIn.webplugincode on iPads that allows for the playback.p  pMy question is, is there any documentation that this is the exact reason Id like to go by this as why we can use the regular codeltembedgtcode code but I need to back it up with proof via a document for iOS. Is this YT plugin on every iPad by default, or do users need to manually install it This seems like a great solution considering our unfortunate incompatibility with an codeltiframegtcode but I need to support the use of the codeltembedgtcodes with hard facts.

Negative 1188 pStated simply my question is as follows Is it possible for a button on a worksheet in a normal excel workbook .xlsx not .xlsm to trigger a macro in another file specifically an installed excel add in .xlam.p  pHere is some background on why I want to achieve this. I have a workbook that many users need to be able to view but only some need to be able to update by filling in a form on another sheet and calling a macro in an add in. The worksheet should not contain any macros to avoid security warnings when opened by normal users. I can do this by having a ribbon button in the add in that the user clicks which will then check that the correct workbook is open and that the form is filled in etc. before executing the update code. However the interface would be nicer if the button instead of appearing on the ribbon was on the worksheet just below the form. Therefore my question is it possible to trigger an external macro from a button click in a non macro enabled workbook. p

Negative 1188 pLanguage Cbr OS Windowsp  pMy application is framed with nt level apis and has to manipulate file and directory handles. On a Zwopenfile or zwcreate file, I get a codeHANDLEcode as a result. Usually the values for the codeHANDLEcode are like 0x00000024, 28,2c... etc. When I cast it as a codeLPBYTEcode to view the contents. Visual studio  shows Expression could not be evaluated. I understood from that the codeHANDLEcode returned from createopen file apis are not pointers to a memory location.  However, windows uses the value and performing file operations.  codeNtquerydirectorycode object supplies me the infomation about handles. However, how windows have implemented this functionality is unknown. Can anyone throw light on it.p

Negative 1188 pI am writing client code in Scala that needs to interface with a framework in Java. The framework is responsible for creating object instances of classes specified via an API, which it does using reflection. For examplep  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic class ReflectionUtil     public static ltTgt T newInstanceClassltTgt aClass      T result     try        ConstructorltTgt meth  aClass.getDeclaredConstructornew Class[]       meth.setAccessibletrue       result  meth.newInstance      catch Exception e        throw new RuntimeExceptione          return result     codepre  pThe classes of the object instances I want to create are implemented in Scala and are paramerterised on a type that has a context bound on it. For examplep  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeclass OrderedValue[A]var value Aimplicit ord Ordering[A]    def get A  value   def setx A   value  x    def cmpthat OrderedValue[A] Int  ord.comparethis.value, that.value  codepre  pI run into a problem when I pass this class to the Java framework to construct new instances as the framework makes the assumption that the class will have a zeroargument constructor available. For example, the following code will result in a codeNoSuchMethodExceptioncode from within codenewInstancecodep  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodedef mainargs Array[String]     val a OrderedValue[Int]  ReflectionUtil.newInstanceclassOf[OrderedValue[Int]]   val b OrderedValue[Int]  ReflectionUtil.newInstanceclassOf[OrderedValue[Int]]    a.set3   b.set5    printlna.cmpb  codepre  pAn attempt at resolving this issue is to add a zeroargument constructor to codeOrderedValuecode however there is no reasonable value for the implicit parameter codeordcode. Setting it to codenullcode will result in a codeNullPointerExceptioncode within codecmpcodep  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodedef this  thisnull.asInstanceOf[A]null.asInstanceOf[Ordering[A]] codepre  pAnother approach is to subclass a particular concrete value of codeOrderedValuecode. For examplep  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeclass OrderedIntValueval v Int extends OrderedValue[Int]v    def this  thisnull.asInstanceOf[Int]   val a OrderedValue[Int]  ReflectionUtil.newInstanceclassOf[OrderedValue[Int]] codepre  pThis will work but is not ideal as it is not always convenient or possible to know the concrete type of codeOrderedValuecode. For example, codenewInstancecode may be called within a scope that is also parameterised on a type i.e. we dont know that its specifically an codeIntcode.p  pSo my question is given that context bounds i.e. type classes are a very useful, and now commonly used, feature within Scala, and given I can not change the internals of the Java framework that I am interfacing with, has anyone encountered or developed an approach that can make this all workp

Which is bizarre because if it were going to default to something I would rather it default to www.primary. com. p      pI dont know if it matters but the sub1.primary.com is under SSL and so is sub7.primary.com, along with 5 others on a .primary.com SSL cert. p blockquote

Negative 1188 pTheres a nice javascript library for displaying photos on iPhone called jaipho.  Im trying to adapt its slider implementation to work in a normal browser, and Im having some problems.p  pHeres the summary of how its slider works  theres a table of images arranged horizontally.  The table is contained in a div which has overflowhidden, and then some javascript moves the table by setting its marginLeft to some negative number.p  pMore specifically  the table is placed inside the div by setting its innerHTML in javascript.  Each table cell is of class slide, which is set by CSS to be the width of the iPhone.  The photos are dynamically placed in the table cells by calls to appendChild, so that they need not all be loaded at once.p  pIt works great on the iPhone in MobileSafari.  With the photos arranged horizontally, one can slide out of view to the left while the next one slides in from the right.p  pNow I try to get it to work on a Mac in a browser window.  The problem is getting a constant width for each cell  I cant use CSS because the width I want is window.innerWidth, not a fixed width like the iPhone.  Ive tried setting the table cells with width tags or style tags to the width of the window.  Looking at what Chrome thinks is going on in its Javascript Console, its as if the table is ignoring the effort of the cells to set their width, and rather the table is setting their widths to be very narrow in an effort to entirely fit inside the window.  Or into its containing div, even though its set to overflow hidden.p  pAnyone have any suggestions how to coerce a table into being very, very wide in pixels, even though only some small part of it will ever be shown at a time  p  pThanks,p  pDavep

Negative 1188 pIn my application, I am often creating new Views and ViewModels, but persisting the same Models. For example, I might show a simple view of a list of items in my main window, and have another window with further details of any particular item.

Negative 1188 pThe application I am working on is relying on Autofac as DI container and one of the reasons that made me decide to use it, among others, was the delegate factory feature see a hrefhttpcode.google.compautofacwikiDelegateFactories titleherehereap  pThis works fine for all cases where I need to recreate the same elements several times as is the case of some reports and related screens. Some reports even those of the same type are executed concurrently but they change only by their userdefined parameters so it makes sense I think to inject factories in order to create instances, passing the free parameters and leave the rest to the application.p  pThe problem comes with the fact that each report is made of a variable number of sub reports tasks and each task implements an ITask interface. Each report may have up to 50 different tasks to use and each task encapsulates a precise business operation. One option I have is to inject delegate factories for and create them when needed.p  pThese tasks have to be dynamically generated by factories and something likep  precodevar myTaskA  taskFactoryConcreteTaskA var myTaskB  taskFactoryConcreteTaskB var myTaskC  taskFactoryConcreteTaskC ... var myTaskZZ   taskFactoryConcreteTaskZZ codepre  prequires a lot of manual wiring delegates, constructor, backing fields etc while something like p  precodevar myTaskA  taskFactory.CreateltConcreteTaskAgt var myTaskB  taskFactory.CreateltConcreteTaskBgt var myTaskC  taskFactory.CreateltConcreteTaskCgt ... var myTaskZZ  taskFactory.CreateltConcreteTaskZZgt codepre  pwould be incredibly less work especially if the taskFactory wraps the container as shown in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1770113howdoiimplementadelegatefactorythis other posta, but also it would basically mean I am using a service locator to create my tasks.p  pWhat other options do I have that may be suitable to solve thisp  pNOTE there is a good chance I am completely off track and that I have to read a lot more about DI, in which case any contribution would be even more importantp

Negative 1188 pWhat is the most efficient way to delete a bunch of items from a hash, based on whether an items value contains a specific substring or not As far as I know, there is not really a way to do this in one simple block. I have to literally grab all the values of that hash in a Java list, then iterate over this list till i find what I need, then delete its key from the hash, and repeat the same procedure ove and over again. p  pAnother approach I tried was to put an id references to the the hash items in a separate list, so that later on, with a single call, i could grab a list of id for items which should be deleted. That was a bit better, but still, the redis implementation I use Jedis does not support the deletion of multiple hash keys, so again I am left with my hands tied.p  pRedis does not support referential integrity, right This means, OK, the keys stored in the Redis list are references to the items in the hash, so if I delete the list, the corresponding items from the hash would eb deleted. There is nothing like that in Redis, rightp  pI will have to go through this loop and delete every single item separately. I wish at least there was something like a block, where I could collect all 1000 commands, and send them in one entire call, rather than 1000 separate ones.p

Negative 1188 pIm currently porting one of my projects to GCC, and Im using the MinGWw64 project to accomplish this as I require both x64 and x86 support.p  pIve hit a problem in setting up my build environment though. My project currently uses the Boost C libraries, and to make the build process easier I use Boost.Build in my project too as it makes integration simple.p  pUnder MSVC this is fine, because I can do the following from the command linep  precodeb2 toolsetmsvc addressmodel32  compile as 32bit b2 toolsetmsvc addressmodel64  compile as 64bit codepre  pMinGWw64 is making this problematic, as the 32bit and 64bit toolchains are housed in separate directories. CMinGW32 and CMinGW64 respectively.p  pIs it possible to set up Boost.Build in a way that it will choose the correct toolchain based on the addressmodel flag If not, what is my next best optionp  pEDITp  pIf it helps, I am using the rubenvb 4.6.31 builds from the MinGWw64 website in the Personal Builds folder I am using these builds in particular as I wish to try getting my code to parse  but not compile  under Clang.p  pEDITp  pOne solution I just thought of would be to manually set the PATH to point to the correct toolchain before compilation, however this adds an extra layer of complication to my build process which Id like to avoid. Ideally I would like it to be as easy as it is for MSVC, though I understand this may not be possible. In the worst case I assume what I just suggested would work, and I would just have to add scripts to correctly set the PATH before invoking Boost.Build. That would mean hardcoding a path though, which I dont want to do...p

Negative 1188 pI am implementing a simple recommendation system for a collection of user created components.p  pI was planning on doing this with JPA and a few dedicated EJB. My entities would have extra couple of lists containing the most up to date recommendations, then an EJB would crawl the data set and update this list periodically. The model is based on the relationships between components, and does not depend on past user behavior. I expect that the data set will remain relatively small. probably no more than half a million items.p  pI have a pretty good idea of how to do this with JPA and EJB, and I think for my particular use case, this would be very effective.p  pShould I spend the time to learn and implement Mahout I do have a bit of experience with hadoop, although, I dont think my data set will be nearly large enough to justify bringing in the elephant.p  pAlso, can anyone point me to a good primer on implementing recommendation systems with mahout p  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 1188 pI want to have a more or less standard NSWindow with a toolbar and all that, but I want the content view to be transparent so that I can see through it. At the same time I want to keep the light gray outline of the window and also its shadow. BUT I want to avoid the inner shadow I get from the toolbar inside the content view area.p  pWhat I have tried so far is just to set the window background color to a semi transparent color and also set opaque to NO. The problem is that the window border fades away with the alpha of the background itself, and the more transparency I have on the background, the more the shadow of the toolbar shows up within the content view.p  pGenerally, the window shadow and border changes depending on the transparency of the content view, which I totally understand. But I want a behavior where it keeps the border and shadow just as if it was a completely opaque window, and then I want the content view area to be transparent.p  pI am not sure what I need to do conceptually to make it work. Maybe I have to draw the window border myself, maybe not. Maybe I need to draw the shadow myself, or maybe not.p  pIs there anyone that know how to build this I dont need exact code details, but rather what parts I need to do custom.. p  pI appreciate any inputp

Negative 1188 pIm making a comic book website built upon a WordPress platform for an old friend for his business. I would like to be able to have a script that goes to various publisher sites and pulls in the data. Im new to programming and Ive read of many different alternatives and just dont know where to begin. Firstly, would this be legal to pull this content from these websites Secondly, heres an example for what I would like to do.p  ol lipPage displays whats coming out for the month. Copy all links from that page within the appropriate div that leads to the comic book details. Save each hyperlink as comiclink or whatever. The script will execute each hyperlink at a time.pli lipGo to the hyperlink for comiclink and scrape content out of the page based     upon whats in certain DIVs on that page. Examplep  ul liCopy amp save comic title within a defined div into titlebr li liCopy amp save previous and future title hyperlinks within a defined div into othertitlesbr br    blockquote   pemNote othertitles will loop off and start the same process itself from 1.embr br li   liSave amp download all images within a defined div to imagesbr li   lipCopy amp save all content within a defined div to content. content is then broken down    and pulled apart based upon the content that is within it. Examplepp blockquote  blockquote   blockquote     blockquote       ul       liIn stores dateli       liformat formatli       liUPC upcli       liPrice priceli       liThe Story storyli       ul     blockquote   blockquote blockquoteli ulli lipCopy amp save defined div hyperlink and save into seriesinfopli lipCopy amp save defined div relatedinfo and then break it down.p  ul liimages within relatedinfo to relatedimagesli licontent within relatedinfo to relatedcontentli lilinks within relatedinfo to relatedlink. relatedlink will loop off and restart this process itself from 1.li ulli ol  pNow that everything is broken apart and saved into its own little pieces. I want WordPress to automatically create a post and then start assigning all this info into the post. Working something like this.p  ol liCheck for existing post with same title if does not exist place title in title for post and pagename. If it exists abort script and move on to the next. li liRemove numbers and alpha characters from title and check for existence of category if it does not exist create it and assign to post. If it exists assigns category to the post.li liCheck for existing category with value format if exists assign to post, if not create amp assign category to post.li liupload images that were downloaded from image into this post.li liCheck for images that contain the word cover and assign as featured image.li ol  pAlso how this whole thing executes also. I dont want this running 247  just once a week I would like this to execute by itself and automatically go to the websites in question and scrape the content and create the pages.p  pIm not asking you guys to write out the whole darn thing for me though I definitely wont object to it Just help point me in the right directions to get this going.

Negative 1188 pI have two LinearLayout views that contain a number of edit texts and checkboxes for entering user information name, email address etc. When a validation fails on one of these fields a gone textview is displayed showing the validation error.p  pI have enclosed the two layouts within a ViewSwitcher and I animate between the two views using the ObjectAnimator class.

The timeline can be viewed at a hrefhttpwww.nsf.govnewsspecialreportshistorynsftimelineindex.jsp relnofollowhttpwww.nsf.govnewsspecialreportshistorynsftimelineindex.jspa. At that time, there were no browser compatibility issues. We are now having  layout issues with the timeline in IE8 and IE9, but not with Firefox, Safari and Chrome. p  pThe IE 9 developer toolbar was deployed to check Javascript issues and no errors were reported. It was suggested at a hrefhttpcode.google.compsimilewidgetsissuesdetailid428 relnofollowhttpcode.google.compsimilewidgetsissuesdetailid428a that the layout issue can be rectified by changing className to class in timelinebundle.js in the similewidgets exhibits. This change was carried out, but did not fix the layout. Then a global change was carried  out but this too did not fix the layout. Then, the nsfhistory.js file was examined but the layout problem persisted. p  pWould you have any suggestion what we could do to rectify the layout problem with the Simile timeline in IE8 and IE9 If it can be fixed, then well be able to keep the timeline on the nsf.gov website. p  pThanks in advance for your help. p  pStevep
Negative 1188 pMy application uses embedded Jetty as the http interface, and it seems to hang after 23 weeks of uptime. Upon inspection there were a lot of sleeping threads, so I ran it locally with jvisualvm and pounded it out with pyplot and bunch of simple gets and found the number of threads always rises, with most of them sleeping.p  pMy code specifically handles async requests with async context with an async listener, and basically sleeps intermittently until it finds results in a results hash populated by the main app. If the result never shows up, the request times out.p  pA coworker suggested I may not be closing the requests properly. Is this the case Ive attached my code below for your criticism after the jvisualvm plot.

Negative 1188 pI am writing an application that periodically fetches data from a web server using ASI HTTP and then processes that data to display something relevant to the user on the UI. The data is retrieved from different requests on a single server. The data itself needs to be processed in a specific order. One of the blocks of data is much bigger than the other ones.p  pIn order not to lock the UI while the data is being processed, I have tried to use the codeNSOperationQueuecode to run the data processing on different threads. This works fine about 90 of the times. However, in the remaining 10 of the time, the biggest block of data is being processed on the main thread, which cause the UI to block for 12 seconds. The application contains two MKMapViews in different tabs. When both MKMapViews tabs are loaded the percentage of time the biggest block of data is being processed on the main thread increases  above 50 which seems to point to the assumption that this happens when there is more concurrent activity.p  pIs there a way to prevent the codeNSOperationQueuecode to run code on the main threadp  pI have tried to play with the codeNSOperationQueuecode codesetMaxConcurrentOperationCountcode, increasing and decreasing it but there was no real change on the issue.p  pThis is the code that starts the periodic refreshp  precode voidrefreshAll           Create Operations     ServerRefreshOperation  smallDataProcessor1Op  [[ServerRefreshOperation alloc] initWithDelegatesmallDataProcessor1]     ServerRefreshOperation  smallDataProcessor2Op  [[ServerRefreshOperation alloc] initWithDelegatesmallDataProcessor2]     ServerRefreshOperation  smallDataProcessor3Op  [[ServerRefreshOperation alloc] initWithDelegatesmallDataProcessor3]     ServerRefreshOperation  smallDataProcessor4Op  [[ServerRefreshOperation alloc] initWithDelegatesmallDataProcessor4]     ServerRefreshOperation  smallDataProcessor5Op  [[ServerRefreshOperation alloc] initWithDelegatesmallDataProcessor5]     ServerRefreshOperation  hugeDataProcessorOp  [[ServerRefreshOperation alloc] initWithDelegatehugeDataProcessor]       Create dependency graph for response processing     [HugeDataProcessorOp addDependencysmallDataProcessor4Op.operation]     [smallDataProcessor5Op addDependencysmallDataProcessor4Op.operation]     [smallDataProcessor4Op addDependencysmallDataProcessor3Op.operation]     [smallDataProcessor4Op addDependencysmallDataProcessor2Op.operation]     [smallDataProcessor4Op addDependencysmallDataProcessor1Op.operation]       Start be sending all requests to server startAsynchronous directly calls the ASIHTTPRequest startAsynchronous method     [smallDataProcessor1Op startAsynchronous]     [smallDataProcessor2Op startAsynchronous]     [smallDataProcessor3Op startAsynchronous]     [smallDataProcessor4Op startAsynchronous]     [smallDataProcessor5Op startAsynchronous]     [hugeDataProcessorOp startAsynchronous]  codepre  pThis is the code that sets the ASI HTTP completion block that starts the data processingp  precode[request setCompletionBlock     [self.delegate setResponseStringrequest.responseString]     [[MyModel queue] addOperationoperation]  operation is a NSInvocationOperation that calls the delegate parse method ] codepre  pI have added this block of code in all NSInvocationOperation Invoked method at the entry pointp  precodeif[NSThread isMainThread]     NSLogRunning ltoperation xgt on Main thread  codepre  pThe line is printed every time the UI freezes.

Negative 1188 pIm making a PONG game for a school project using Kivy in Python. So far thanks to this forum Ive made myself some AI for the NPC paddle. This is the codep  precode    if self.ball.y lt self.player2.centery         self.player2.centery  self.player2.centery  4     if self.ball.y gt self.player2.centery         self.player2.centery  self.player2.centery  4 codepre  pThis is in a method of PongGame class called ArtificialIntelligence.p  pI use this to call itp  precodeClock.scheduleintervalgame.ArtificialIntelligence, 1300      codepre  pThis allows me to call it once every 1300th of a second. However, anything more than 1300, I seem to have no difference. I.e. 19001 does not call it once every 19001th of a second.p  pThe way it works is that it increases the y coordinate 4 pixels relative to the balls position, and it does this once every 1300th of a second, hence why it doesnt lag at this rate. This is basically an easy mode for the player. If I want to do a hard mode, I need to make the NPC more accurate. I can do this by doingp  precodeself.player2.centery  self.player2.centery  20 codepre  pSomething like this. This would be extremely accurate. HOWEVER, it does NOT look fluid, it looks laggy. I assume I could get the same amount of movement by emcalling the method more oftenem instead of changing the amount it moves via altering the pixel movement. However, I dont know how to do this, because, as I said, changing it from anywhere above 1300 seems to make no difference. p  pThis is how I use my paddlep  precodeif touch.x lt self.width3     self.player1.centery  touch.y codepre  pand I can move it as fast as I want because this updates as I move the mouse. And it looks fluid because it updates as often as it needs to update. I dont know how to do this with my AI.p  pDoes anyone know how I could basically make the NPC paddle more accurate, allowing me to do EasyNormalHard, etc, while retaining fluidity and no lag I see only one way I could do it Increase the amount the method is called. p  pHowever I bet there is a better way and I dont know how to do it.

Negative 1188 pSo, Im going to receive an API call atp  precodePOST httpolddomain.comapicall     Post contents in Raw Body codepre  pI need to redirect that top  precodePOST httpnewdomain.comapicall codepre  pWith the same Raw Body contents.  Seems theres no way to redirect a POST serverside, and the only way to do it is to generate an HTML form and submit that form via JS.  So, given that, Im not even sure its possible for our API clients that are going to expect JSON returned back to them to render and submit that HTMLJS in order to redirect the POST.p  pSo now Im thinking that I may need to just translate the POST raw body contents into query string variables  the volume of data in the call is probably low enough that we can get away with this  and then maybe update the API call handler to accept GET parameters in this scenario.p  pNone of this seems at all clean.  Please tell me there is a better way.p  pUPDATE The implementation requires codecurlcode compatibility, because the API client uses it.p
Negative 1188 pBasically, I try to pickle and restore a Traits object, which contains a list of objects.

Negative 1188 pI am new to Workflow foundation and want to understand the purpose of codeActivityActioncode and codeActivityFunccode and how it differs from having child activities instead.p  pAs far as I can understand child activities may exist in some composite codeNativeActivitycode and have to be scheduled by it. So child activities emmayem be used by codeNativeActivitycode as event handlers during its execution. So for example this NativeActivity may run some long running computation and schedule its child when it finishes.p  pcodeActivityActioncode and codeActivityFunccode func returns a result and action does not exist for the same purpose  to enable plugging custom handlers in the course of execution defined in the codeNativeActivitycode. The difference is that those are strongly typed and look more like contract declared by its parent.p  pSo I came to conclusion that the main difference is strong typing and ActivityFuncAction may be swapped with child activities. Is my understanding wrong or am I missing somethingp

Negative 1188 pI am solving a problem for an AI course and I have to implement a graph search with the BFS algorithm in Python. My implementation actually finds the solution, but it expands too many nodes. The answer says that 269 nodes should be expanded, but I got 275.p  pTo keep track of the visited nodes I use a dictionary. The keys are the expanded states and the values are 1. Once I get a nodes successors, I check if they are present in the dictionary. If yes, I just ignore this successor. If not, I push it into the fringe queue. I thought that this process would prevent expanding already visited nodes, but it doesnt seem to be the case.p  pAnyone could give me a hint about this No code should be needed, as all I want is some idea of what might be going wrong.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1188 pIm using an SVG font in Chrome.p  pFrom time to time, the glyphs seem to end up with a width of zero. This means if I have the character all by itself, its parent container gets a width of zero, so it is basically not shown. If its parent has other things, itll appear behind the font.p  pSo, if I have  with the custom font, it winds up invisible because it seems the glyph has a width of zero.p  pIf I have something like p Cookiep, I see Cookie, and the  is the custom font and is behind the word Cookie.p  pIm not sure if it is a Chromespecific issue, a .svg font specific issue or what. And the weird thing is it only happens sometimes. Occasionally it will start with a refresh, then persist through several refreshes. Eventually itll go away generally when the cache is cleared.p  pIt doesnt seem to be a corrupt file download either, since comparing the content length of the response that works and when it doesnt is the same... though Im not prepared to rule anything out.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1188 pI am doing some testing on my Nexus 7 tablets Chrome browser, and found the curious codewebkitForcecode property in the touch object provided by touch events. p  pSure enough, it appears to be a scalar that is set usually between about 0.05 and around 1.2 which appears to scale with the emfinger pressureem on the capacitive touch screen. It works with multiple simultaneous touches I have a test page that drew out circles scaled to this value and it correlates with finger pressureposition quite well, providing a 3 dimensional quantity for each touch.p  pThere is some slight inconsistency that may be seen when changing pressure on one finger affecting the reading provided for another finger that is close to it in either axis. This looks to be a result of limitations from either the actual capacitive touch hardware or software that processes output from it. p  pI have googled this and found practically nothing. It is really strange that Google does not have any sort of site that I can find through the search engine that documents this. p  pSo my question is where can I find more information about this neat little feature How come iOS devices with arguably more responsive and capable touch screens provide nothing of this sort Which Android devices and OSBrowser combinations provide this feature p

Negative 1188 pAlmost any hyperlink in an email sent to an Facebook.com address is broken with a fbsbx.com redirect link. If you change the fbsbx.com in that link to Facebook.com, then the link works, so its something about that domain.  For example, when I email myself this link a hrefhttpnews.cnet.com830117938105575047861theweirdworldwhere3dprintingandartcollide relnofollowhttpnews.cnet.com830117938105575047861theweirdworldwhere3dprintingandartcollidea  When I click through it as an incoming Facebook message its become a hrefhttpfbsbx.coml.phpuhttp3A2F2Fnews.cnet.com2F8301179381055750478612Ftheweirdworldwhere3dprintingandartcollide2FamphrAQEQCCGnamps1 relnofollowhttpfbsbx.coml.phpuhttp3A2F2Fnews.cnet.com2F8301179381055750478612Ftheweirdworldwhere3dprintingandartcollide2FamphrAQEQCCGnamps1a That just takes me to a Not Found page. p  pSo far I havent been able to find a workaround.p  pThis is especially a problem for me given that my emergency apps allows people to notify their friends or their emergencies via Facebook message. Those Facebook messages contain links to the live session, but Facebook is breaking those links. We send the links by sending them as Facebook.com emails. The messages get through, but the links are broken. Fixing this is crucial for my app.p

Negative 1188 pI have just found the most bizarre Internet Explorer issue I think Ive ever seen, and have absolutely no idea how to get around it, so was hoping that maybe someone has seen something similar before and knows what causes it  how to fix it. p  pI have a multiline textbox, as followsp  precodeltaspTextBox runatserver IDtxtDoctorNotes TextModeMultiLine Rows8 Width270gtltaspTextBoxgt codepre  pI noticed this morning that some of the words in this textbox were duplicated, and thinking Id just made a mistake when typing it I clicked in the box to change the contents, and strangely the duplications disappeared, and it read as it should be. I have no onclick event on the textbox, though jquery is used when the contents are changed so when I tab out of the box jquery flags up that some contents of the form have been changed. Thinking it was a one off rendering issue, I reloaded the page, and sure enough the same duplications reappeared, clicked in the box, they disappeared. Oddly the duplicated words werent at the beginning or end of the contents, and werent even all together, it just randomly duplicated them.p  pTried it in Chrome, works perfect, no duplication. p  pAs an example Ive changed the contents to the followingp  pthe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. p  pIve put a breakpoint on the line that sets the contents of the textbox, and it shows the above, however, when the form loads it showsp  pthe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy over the lazy dog. p  pIf I click on it, it changes to read correctly. p  pWhen I had my actual notes in there earlier, it also duplicated the last word, but separately from the others, so in the above example it would have readp  pthe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy over the lazy dog dog.p  pIm running Internet Explorer 9.

This makes it very difficult to cleanly uninstall the driverp  pCan this be fixed using an uninstaller What is the best way to fix the affected machine in an automated way p
Negative 1188 pIm trying to rotate an image a full rotation, a small angleincrement at a time. p  pEach proceeding rotation should begin after the previous rotation has been displayed. p  pHow fast the rotation happens means nothing to me  as long as each rotation is displayed its fine by me. That means it can be practically considered to be too fast.p  pIve tried a few different approaches for this. I have a working solution below something along these lines, at least  Ive been playing with the code, so it might not be completely compilable. p  pcodehandlercode is a Handler instance and is together with all of the code below located in the body of the activity class that Im starting from. coderotationIncrementcode is 0.36, so were rotating the image 1000 times by posting a new Runnable to the UIthread each time the previous rotation is finished.    p  precodepublic void startView view      MainActivity.rotation0     imageview.setScaleTypeScaleType.MATRIX     handler.postnew RotationRunnable          public class RotationRunnable implements Runnable          Override         public void run              MainActivity.rotationrotationIncrement             Log.dRotating, String.valueOfrotation             Matrix matrix  new Matriximageview.getImageMatrix             matrix.setRotaterotation             imageview.setImageMatrixmatrix             imageview.invalidate              if MainActivity.rotationlt360                  handler.postnew RotationRunnable              else                  Log.dElapsed, String.valueOfSystem.nanoTimestartTime                        codepre  pThe code above gives me a pretty smooth animation. With a 1000 rotations, it takes about 16s on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus to finish. p  pMy question is this p  pstrongIs there a better way to do this  if the goal is to have the rotation happen as fast as possible  and maintaining that each rotation is displayed in orderstrong p  pThis is NOT going to be implemented into a product or anything  this is more an artificial test, so Im not looking for any more convenient ways of animating a rotation.p

Negative 1188 h2Informationh2  pI would like to use OpenCVs HOG detection to identify objects that can be seen in a variety of orientations.  The only problem is, I cant seem to find a reasonable feature detector or classifier to detect this in a rotation and scale invaraint way as is needed by objects such as forearms.  p  h2Prior Workh2  pLets focus on forearms for this discussion.  A forearm can have multiple orientations, the primary distinct features probably being its contour edges.  It is possible to have images of forearms that are pointing in any direction in an image, thus the complexity.  So far I have done some in depth research on using HOG descriptors to solve this problem, but I am finding that the variety of poses produced by forearms in my positives training set is producing very low detection scores in actual images.  I suspect the issue is that the gradients produced by each positive image do not produce very consistent results when saved into the Histogram.  I have reviewed many research papers on the topic trying to resolve or improvie this, including the original from Dalal amp Triggs [Link] a hrefhttplear.inrialpes.frpeopletriggspubsDalalcvpr05.pdf relnofollowhttplear.inrialpes.frpeopletriggspubsDalalcvpr05.pdfa It also seems that the assumptions made for detecting whole humans do not necessary apply to detecting individual features particularly the assumption that all humans are standing up seems to suggest HOG is not a good route for rotation invariant detection like that of forearms.  p  h2Noteh2  pIf possible, I would like to steer clear of any nonfree solutions such as those pertaining to Sift, Surf, or Haar.p  h2Questionh2  pWhat is a good solution to detecting rotation and scale invariant objects in an image  Particularly for this example, what would be a good solution to detecting all orientations of forearms in an imagep

Negative 1188 pNormally, after I finish my coding, I always check for security vulnerabilities mainly XSS using a hrefhttpwww.veracode.com relnofollowveracodea. Most of the times in my JSP, if I have a code like codeltbean.getValuesgtcode its flagged as XSS vulnerable. To resolve it, I mainly use JSTL tags like codeltcoutgtcode.p  pNow consider this scenario, I have a JSP, which I am loading with an codeltiframegtcode. The same piece of code as shown above is there. Veracode does not know that this jsp is shown in codeltiframegtcode and hence will throw this piece of code as XSS vulnerable. But if such a piece of code is in an codeltiframegtcode, does it not make it almost difficult to crack it via crosssite scripting, as codeltiframegtcode is difficult to hack intop  pI am just a little bit confused.

Negative 1188 pI have an ASP.NET MVC application which uses Google signin to authenticate the user. The flow is as followsp  ol liUser accesses controller action decorated with [Authorize] attribute, forms authentication is configured so the user is forwarded to the log in page.li liUser clicks the Sign In with Google button and the server side flow is initiated as per a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebsigninserversideflowusingonetimecodeflow relnofollowguideali liServer receives the Google tokens which are used to authenticate the user, logging them in and returning the standard asp.net auth cookie in the response. The user can then access the site with the cookie.li ol  pNow, if I go through the usual asp.net forms log out process of clearing the users cookiesession theres a problem. If they attempt to access the application after theyve logged out but are still signed into a Google product in another tab, theyll be redirected to my login page. The Google signin button will automatically sign them back in again initiating the whole sign in process and getting a brand new asp.net cookie The only way to truly sign out is to ensure you are not signed into any Google products still and then attempt to sign out. Not exactly user friendly. I guess the same thing happens with all Google products, if Im signed into Gmail and open Docs, Ill get signed in automagically. The difference being if you sign out of one, youll sign out of all Google products. I think.p

Negative 1188 pIm totally new to Haskell so apologies if the question is silly.p  pWhat I want to do is recursively build a list while emat the same timeem building up an accumulated value based on the recursive calls. This is for a problem Im doing for a Coursera course, so I wont post the exact problem but something analogous.p  pSay for example I wanted to take a list of ints and double each one ignoring for the purpose of the example that I could just use codemapcode, but I emalsoem wanted to count up how many times the number 5 appears in the list.p  pSo to do the doubling I could do thisp  precodefoo []      [] foo xxs  x  2  foo xs codepre  pSo far so easy. But how can I also maintain a count of how many times codexcode is a five The best solution Ive got is to use an explicit accumulator like this, which I dont like as it reverses the list, so you need to do a reverse at the endp  precodefoo total acc []      total, reverse acc foo total acc xxs  foo if x  5 then total  1 else total x2  acc xs codepre  pBut I feel like this should be able to be handled nicer by the codeStatecode monad, which I havent used before, but when I try to construct a function that will fit the pattern Ive seen I get stuck because of the recursive call to codefoocode. Is there a nicer way to do thisp  pEDIT I need this to work for very long lists, so any recursive calls need to be tailrecursive too. The example I have here manages to be tailrecursive thanks to Haskells  tail recursion modulo cons.p

Now, my dilemma is the followingp  ul lipDoes PeerFinder detect that a socket is open with that device and automatically omits it from the available peers list orpli lipPeerFinder only supports one connection at a time frowny face and I have to use something else to build my app If so, what Dpli ul  pThanksp

Negative 1188 pI am creating an import application in VB.NET for an SQL Server 2008 database. I am trying to make the import as generic as possible to reduce maintenance in the future.

I am currently try to check to see whether a value that is being imported is castable as the data type of the field in the database. For example, if you want to import a date into the database but you mistakenly put an address field instead, I want to pick this up and alert the user.p  pSo, I have a VB datatable with the same schema as the database table and a value which I would like to go into the datatable.

Negative 1188 pI have an issue that Im trying to solve regarding the serial port in Linux.  Im able to open, read from, and close the port just fine.  However, I want to ensure that I am the only person readingwriting from the port at any given time.p  pI thought that this was already done for me after I make the open function call.  However, I am able to call open multiple times on the same port in my program.  I can also have two threads which are both reading from the same port simultaneously.p  pI tried fixing this issue with flock and I still had the same problem.  Is it because both systems calls are coming from the same pid, even though there are different file descriptors involved with each set of opens and reads  For the record, both open calls do return a valid file descriptor.p  pAs a result, Im wondering if theres any way that I can remedy by problem.  From my programs perspective, its not a big deal if two calls to open are successful on the same port since the programmer should be aware of the hilarity that they are causing.  However, I just want to be sure that when I open a port, that I am the only process with access to it.p  pThanks for the help. p

Negative 1188 pIm using ActiveMQ and I would like to know how to solve this specific case.p  pWhen the consumer is down, the producer sends a message to the queue. The message will remain in the queue until the consumer is running to consume it.p  pNow imagine I shutdown the producer, the message will STILL remain in the queue. Now i run the consumer and it will try to consume that message, but wont be able to reply back to the producer since its down.p  pI would like to solve this problem by cleaning the messages if the producer is out.  The ActiveMQ Broker cleans the Queue after stopping. I would like to do the same for the messages of a respective producer.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1188 pI have a FrameLayout with four SurfaceViews arranged in a 2x2 grid. The user can resize each of the views.p  pId like the views to be drawn in order of their area, with the largest view drawn first and so on. Each time a view is resized, I order the views by their area, and update the FrameLayoutp  precodepublic void reorderViews          PlotView child1         PlotView child2         boolean swap  false          forint i  0 i lt layout.getChildCount i              child1  PlotView layout.getChildAti             forint j  i  1 j lt layout.getChildCount j                  child2  PlotView layout.getChildAtj                 ifchild1.area lt child2.area                      layout.removeViewAtj                     layout.addViewchild2, i                                              codepre  pThis works, in the sense that the FrameLayouts children array holds the views in the correct order. But after reordering, the views continue to draw in their original order i.e. the order in which they were originally added. p  pIve tried requesting layout on the FrameLayout, on the individual child views, on the FrameLayouts parent view. Ive also tried invalidating everything. Ive overridden the FrameLayouts onDraw hoping to force the correct draw order. No go.p  pA few points Im using FrameLayout rather than Grid because Id like larger views to obscure smaller views, instead of having a larger view push a smaller view aside, as is the behaviour in GridView.p  pIn order to position the child views properly, I adjust their margins and set their gravity to top it doesnt seem to matter what value I use for gravity, just so long as gravity is set to something, margins work.  Might the gravity be the issuep  pAlso, Im sure theres a more efficient way to reorder the views, but theres only four total, so this works ok. p

Negative 1188 pI am working on a simple task list project right now. I have built the I have so far using jQuery and Javascript to insertdeletemanipulate the tasks. Because all of the elements are createdremovedchanged in the DOM, every time the page is refreshed, all changes to the list are lost. I dont want to use a caching system because the aim is to create a system that can be accessed from multiple devices. I would like to set up some sort of PHP database that would allow me to create user profiles and have each users tasks separated.p  pI am familiar with Wordpress so Im thinking I could use that and its user profile system to accomplish what I need. The issue I have is that I cant find any information as to how I could send the changes that were made to the DOM to a separate database entry associated with each user.p  pMy strategy from there unless anyone could suggest a better method of storing the data would be to essentially make a copy of a set section of the raw HTML and post that to the database entry when the user hits a save button. Each time they log in, the most recent HTML would be loaded into the DOM as a starting point. They could then make the changes they desire, hit save before leaving the site and the cycle would repeat.p  pI am new to development side of things, so I could be making this way harder than it needs to be. Any links to topics similar to this, suggestions, advice would be appreciated. Im not asking for an indepth howto guide though that would be nice but to just be pointed in the right direction.p

Could someone please read this back to me in English and answer two or three questionsp  pIs the buffered data extracted from this method or how should it be, if I have it wrong  Are there parts of it that are no longer needed And although I really like the decoupling from my business code, and keeping all the socket code in just one or two methods, is there a better way to do this decoupled AND readablep  precode    public static IObservableltintgt WhenDataReceivedthis Socket socket, int byteCount, SocketFlags flags  SocketFlags.None              Contract.RequiresbyteCount gt 0          return Observable.Createltintgt             observer gt                              byte[] buffer  new byte[byteCount]                 int remainder  byteCount                 bool shutdown  false                  return Observable.Deferltintgt gt                         Task.Factory.FromAsyncltintgtsocket.BeginReceivebuffer, buffer.Length  remainder, remainder, flags,                         result gt                                                      var read  intresult.AsyncState                             remainder  read                              if read  0                                 shutdown  true                         ,                         null, socket.EndReceive.ToObservable                     .TakeWhile gt remainder gt 0 ampamp shutdown                     .TakeLast1                     .Subscribe                         observer.OnNext,                         ex gt                                                      var socketError  ex as SocketException                              if socketError  null                                 ampamp socketError.SocketErrorCode  SocketError.Disconnecting                                      socketError.SocketErrorCode  SocketError.Shutdown                                                              observer.OnCompleted                                                          else  observer.OnErrorex                          ,                         observer.OnCompleted                    codepre  pThe function that calls it still has compilation errors I dont understand .Do and .BitConverter have some invalid argumentsp  precode        static IObservableltstringgt StartClientthis IObserverltScanInformationgt observer, IPAddress ip, int port              var client  Observable.Using              gt new SocketAddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp,             socket gt             from  in socket.WhenConnectedip, port             from message in                 from first in socket.WhenDataReceived4                  let length  BitConverter.ToInt32first, 0                  from message in                      Observable.If                          condition  gt length gt 0,                          thenSource from second in socket.WhenDataReceivedlength                                      select Encoding.UTF8.GetStringsecond, 0, length,                          elseSource Observable.Returnltstringgtnull                  select message                 .Repeat                 .TakeWhilemessage gt message  null             select message          return             client.Doobserver.TakeLast1      codepre

Negative 1188 pIve been seeing intermittent errors in a couple of systems Ive been working on, when using the same methodology not the same code leading me to believe the problem may be linked to creating and using structs in the same request. Im wondering if its possible theres a race conditionp  pThe scenario is this Were on an ecommerce system, looking at a product, or in some cases a list of products. The code in question is designed to return the images associated with each product, in a struct that we can use for display of said images.p  pAt the beginning of the request, the code looks for database records associated with the item in question. These records represent images for the products. These records are returned in a single codeCFQuerycode call or more accurately, a call to a function which returns the results of a codeCFQuerycode call, shaped into a struct containing various info.p  pThe code then loops through the supplied image struct, and adds various information to a Local struct. Later in the request we use the data in the struct to display the images in our codeltimggtcode tags. We also populate the codeltimggtcode tag with codedatacode attributes for use with JavaScript.p  pIn the case that any particular image was not correctly returned by the query  usually because the physical file is missing  we use a generic placeholder image. This is done by putting the struct creation inside a codetrycatchcode block.p  pImportantly strongthis works.strongp  pWhats happening however, is that emvery intermittentlyem, when referring to a node in the struct weve created, we find that it does not exist and CF throws an error  this happens maybe 1 of the time and reloading the same page, everything will work perfectly.p  pIve had this same problem on multiple systems, on multiple servers, on different versions of ColdFusion 8 amp 10 to be specific and using completely different code to achieve similar results. The first system I saw this issue on, actually used codeFileExistscode to check that the image file was available and thus I thought that the problem was probably caused by the bottleneck of the filesystem  I tried many ways around this and eventually eliminated it altogether in the new system  but the problem persists.p  pThe only thing I can think of, is that when creating a struct and then using that struct later in the same request, theres a possibility that a race condition occurs whereby I refer to a node in the struct before its finished being created. Im not using threading here though, so I cant really see how thats possible... Im out of other ideas.p  pSome code is below to show what Im doing, but given that the same issue arises on completely different systems, I think its the methodology rather than the code that has a problem.p  precodelt Get product images gt ltcfset Local.stProductImages  Application.cfcParts.getPartImages         liItemID  Arguments.pid  gt   lt Loop through images gt ltcfloop listListSortstructKeyListLocal.stProductImages[item amp Arguments.pid], text indexigt     ltcftrygt         ltcfset Local[ImageURL amp i amp Large]     Local.stProductImages[item amp Local.arguments.pid][i].largewatermarked.URL gt         ltcfcatchgt             ltcfset Local[ImageURL amp i amp Large]     Application.com.Images.getMissingImages.large gt         ltcfcatchgt     ltcftrygt                             ltcftrygt         ltcfset Local[ImageURL amp i amp Med]       Local.stProductImages[item amp Local.arguments.pid][i].med.URL gt         ltcfcatchgt             ltcfset Local[ImageURL amp i amp Med]       Application.com.Images.getMissingImages.med gt         ltcfcatchgt     ltcftrygt                             ltcftrygt         ltcfset Local[ImageURL amp i amp Small]         Local.stProductImages[item amp Local.arguments.pid][i].small.URL gt         ltcfcatchgt             ltcfset Local[ImageURL amp i amp Small]         Application.com.Images.getMissingImages.small gt         ltcfcatchgt     ltcftrygt                              ltimg class           altProdImgltcfif i EQ image03gt endImageltcfifgt          src              Local[ImageURL amp i amp Small]          image            i          alt                       dataimgsmall    Local[ImageURL amp i amp Small]         dataimgmed      Local[ImageURL amp i amp Med]         dataimglarge    Local[ImageURL amp i amp Large]         dataimgnum      i         datapid         Arguments.pid     gt ltcfloopgt codepre  pThe error occurs in the codeltimggtcode tag, when referring to a node created in the preceding code  Something likep  blockquote   pElement ImageURLimage02Large is undefined in a Java object of type class coldfusion.runtime.LocalScope. p blockquote  pBut only very occasionally...

Negative 1188 pI have been at this for over an hour, I have read everything under the sun about multithreading in PHP, and I am lost when it comes to returning values to the parent thread.

Negative 1188 pfolks, lets suppose I have two activities, A and B. Activity A is in charge to span a thread to get some json a list of countries for example from a rest service which must then be cached in a var called for example countries in a Singleton object. Which then will be retrieved from Activity B to fill a Spinner widget in B UI. What is happening currently in my code is that var countries in the Singleton object is returning null. Seems as there was no time enough to get the data from the backend. So, which do you think is the best way to manage thisp

Negative 1188 pWe are trying to emulate a stepped area chart with Kendo UI to denote the directionposition in which an actuator travels over a period of time 1 denoting clockwise, 1 denoting a counterclockwise direction during the course of a day. The period of time over which the actuator completes its transition is not constant. p  pThe code is included below alternatively please feel free to use the following jsfiddle at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpirahawkXT6CZ15 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netpirahawkXT6CZ15a to avoid any setup. We have used the Kendo Stockchart because it provides a complementary navigator component which allows the user to restrict the graph to a desired time period. However we are finding oddities in the chart api especially when the data set has large time lapses. As shown in the example below, we started off with receiving inputs that have 1 second intervals between them. Plotting these on the chart achieves the shape that we expect to see. However adding additional datapoints that are now apart by a few hours please uncomment the data points shown, we are finding that the chart api seems to somehow incorrectly extrapolate the earlier data points. p  pWhen using the navigator to restrict the chart to the earlier period between 2am  230am, we do once again achieve the original shape. However we would like to have the same shape shown without having to do this i.e. stop the api from extrapolating data points with large intervals between data points.

Negative 1188 pFirst off this question is based around PySide, but it is a general question of inheritance for class attributes.p  pSo I have an inheritance problem. I basically want to inherit from 2 PySide GUI classes. Multiple inheritance had major conflicts and gave errors. Basically, I made a custom widget and want to make that same widget into a dock widget floating window.p  pOne way that I found easy to implement was to override the stronggetattrstrong method to redirect attribute calls, like below.p  precodeclass DockWidgetQtGui.QDockWidget     def initself         super.init         self.test  Test           Container is a custom widget containing the Test widget and a toolbar.         self.setWidgetself.test.getCustomContainer      def getattrself, name         Call a propertys method when the given attribute name is not found.          Note Gives full access to the test attribute.          Args             name str Method or property name.                  if hasattrself.test, name             return self.test.getattributename      end getattr  end class DockWidget  class TestQtGui.QWidget     def doSomethingself, msg         printmsg      end doSomething  end Test  widg  DockWidget widg.doSomethingTest codepre  pI would like to know if this is considered really bad, and if there is a better way.p

Negative 1188 pIn the book emThe Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programmingem, the authors present two alternative ways of finding the least divisor codekcode of a number codencode with codek gt 1code, claiming that the second version is much faster than the first one. I have problems understanding why I am a beginnner.p  pHere is the first version page 10p  precodeld  Integer gt Integer  finds the smallest divisor of n which is gt 1 ld n  ldf 2 n  ldf  Integer gt Integer gt Integer ldf k n  n rem k  0  k          k  2 gt n       n          otherwise       ldf k  1 n codepre  pIf I understand this correctly, the codeldcode function basically ends up iterating through all integers in the interval code[2..sqrtn]code and stops as soon as one of them divides codencode, returning it as the result.p  pThe second version, which the authors claim to be much faster, goes like this page 23p  precodeldp  Integer gt Integer  finds the smallest divisor of n which is gt 1 ldp n  ldpf allPrimes n  ldpf  [Integer] gt Integer gt Integer ldpf pps n  rem n p  0  p                p  2 gt n     n                otherwise     ldpf ps n  allPrimes  [Integer] allPrimes  2  filter isPrime [3..]  isPrime  Integer gt Bool isPrime n  n lt 1      error Not a positive integer            n  1     False            otherwise  ldp n  n codepre  pThe authors claim that this version is faster because it iterates only through the list of emprimesem within the interval code2..sqrtncode, instead of iterating through all numbers in that range. p  pHowever, this argument doesnt convince me the recursive function codeldpfcode is eating one by one the numbers from the list of primes codeallPrimescode. This list is generated by doing codefiltercode on the list of all integers.p  pSo unless I am missing something, this second version ends up iterating through all numbers within the interval code2..sqrtncode too, but for each number it first checks whether it is prime a relatively expensive operation, and if so, it checks whether it divides codencode a relatively cheap one.p  pI would say that just checking whether codekcode divides codencode for each codekcode should be faster.

Negative 1188 pWell I want to highlight this and bring it all in this thread, as the rest of threads did not have a concluded answer, so before skipping into them here are the threads I referred top  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22203862adtdoesntcreatedefaulthelloworldbutcommandlinedoesAdt doesn39t create default hello world but command line doesap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22250633eclipsebehavingdifferentlywhilecreatingnewprojectactivity[solved ]Eclipse behaving differently while creating new projectactivityap  pADT has been behaving a bit weird since past few days. I keep my SDK always updated so I frequently Run the SDK manager and download all the updates. recently I noticed that if I create a new android app project it is not creating a default MainActivity even if I check that box, it does not create a Activity under src and more to annoy me, I wasnt able to refactor anything, so I realized that I had to update my Eclipse as after reading few posts, but now when I create every new project it creates an annoying appcompatv7 project with EVERY  project, say I create two new projects it creates appcompatv72....this is driving me crazy and the new project library is the appcompatv7 project. This is becoming annoying and no idea whats going on here  What should I do...please rescue me  Thanks in advance ....A screenshot to annoy u guys too ...  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsOPZq.png altToday is not my dayp  pCurrent Alternative, not a solutionp  pstrongAs of 1252014 with ADT 23.0.2 I dont see this issue anymore.strongp  pI have waited for an acceptable solution on this issue as of now there is none, but one of the SO members directed me to this post a hrefhttpscode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid66975 relnofollowhttpscode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid66975a. What I am doing is described in one of the solutions below, but for people who have come to this post, the alternative is to delete that ugly projectif you have more than one which has been created and add up this oneappcompatv7 as a library. So if you create another project and appcomatv72...comes up delete that and point your project to the appcompatv7, do the same for other projects too. This is not recommended for some reason though, but it worked well for me till now without issues. If anyone hits up with a solution please post it here. Current Alternative, not a solutionp

Negative 1188 pIn my Android project, I have a class that extends FragmentActivity in order to display 2 tabs which are fragments. I am trying to pass data from a JSON Object in one Activity to a textView on one of these tabs.

However, it will not display on the tab. p  pSince I have the tabs set up in another package, I used a LayoutInflater to access the descriptionText TextView field in the infoFrag.xml file.

Negative 1188 pI have an iPad application which opens a socket connection to a server in Intranet using socket libraries in C . While starting the application, if the iPad is not connected to the same network i.e. can not resolve the Domain Name of the server, I expect it to establish a VPN connection automatically. But socket calls and getaddrinfo methods in the application can not do this. They just fail to connect to the server without trying to open the VPN connection. p  pWith Safari, browsing to the address http... works fine and succesfully starts the VPN. If I make a similar HTTP request in the beginning of the application by using the code below, I can make it start the VPN connection.

Negative 1188 pI am supposed to create an inside web based APEX application for students working at Oracle. The login is managed via SingleSignOn. Also, I need to have two user roles, Student and Administrator, each of them with different privileges and different pages they can see. There seems to be no obvious way to do this.p  pI was thinking about somehow extracting the username from email used in SSO, linking it with the database of People and having a column there that defines the user role. Then it would be stored somewhere and will determine the rights the person has. It seems messy though and I am quite new to APEX  I guess there is a better way to do this.p  pI know this can be done directly in APEX itself, but it would be much better to get this working in the app.p

Negative 1188 pIm trying to write a function that displays the PID of the owning process of all threads in a system in multiple message boxes.p  precodevoid CheckProcess  LPCSTR blahzix HANDLE tsnap  CreateToolhelp32Snapshot TH32CSSNAPTHREAD, 0 THREADENTRY32 tentry tentry.dwSize  sizeof tentry BOOL CRec  Thread32Firsttsnap, amptentry GetLastError while CRec      blahzix  tentry.th32OwnerProcessID     MessageBox NULL, NULL, blahzix, MBOK     CRec  Thread32Nexttsnap, amptentry  CloseHandletsnap  codepre  pI was confused about why this wasnt working for a while so I opened it up in OllyDBG and found out that the code for codeMessageBoxcodewas having its third parameter receive the PID data directly instead of receiving an address which has the PID stored as a string, resulting in an access violation when the codeMessageBoxcode function tries to access data stored at 00000004. If I remove the line codeblahzix  tentry.th32OwnerProcessIDcode and append the third line to look like this codeLPCSTR blahzix  anythingcode then instead of crashing codeMessageBoxcode properly displays a messagebox with the title anything.p  pWhy does this happen Am I correct in thinking that the compiler decides variable blahzix isnt used anywhere except in this messagebox function and it always equals tentry.th32OwnerProcessID so they might as well be the same variable, Ill just get rid of it and make messagebox use that variable instead.p  pEDIT Let me rephrase my question. If codeLPCSTR blahzix  fdisafcode uses the  operator and the  operator is supposed to change the value of the variable on the left to the value of the data or variable on the right, then how come its use to create a string for blahzix is valid Since blahzix is apparently actually a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa38375128vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowa pointera I would assume the  operator should only change where the variable points to instead of changing the contents in it. How come using the  operator in this instance changes the data of the string that it points to and using it in this instance codeblahzix  tentry.th32OwnerProcessIDcode changes the data of the pointer instead of the data of the string Shouldnt the  operator change one or the other How can I make the  operator specify which data I want to changep

Negative 1188 pIm working on a Backbone app, but everything Ive read so far is either about displaying a list of items a TODO list for example or a single item.p  pRight now I have users, each user has a list of skills pretty much like any game. I can easily get all users or a single user, the same for the skills but what if I want to get all the skills for a given user How would I do thatp  pI thought about just adding a property to the users with a new instance of a collection, something like thisp  precodevar Users  Backbone.Model.extend   skills new Skills user this    var Skills  Backbone.Collection.extend   model Skill,   url someUrl,   initialize function options       fetch all skills from an user     this.fetch data  user options.user.getid       codepre  pBut I dont have much experience with Backbone and I dont really like the idea of that, also the request would look something like codesomeUrluser1code which Id rather avoid, codesomeUrluser1code would be much better.p  pIve also noticed a hrefhttpbackbonerelational.org relnofollowBackboneRelationala but I havent really tried it, it seems a bit of an overkill for my problem, but maybe Im wrong.p  pWhat approach should I take to fetch all of my users skills Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1188 pI currently have a desktop application which requires the user to have a username and a password. These credentials are stored on a webserver myserver.com, so when he types the username and the password and clicks on the Login button, theyre sent to the webserver. If the credentials are right, the server will return ok and the main form will be displayed. If not, the server will return wrong and an alert will be displayed. However, this is very insecure, because a user can just edit the hosts file, redirect myserver.com to his localhost, which always returns ok, and bypass the login screen.p  pHow can I make a more secure login form for a desktop appp

Negative 1188 pI wanted to know what is the best way of doing the email verification for new user . I am using  angular js as frontend and using laravel in the backend . So I am confused between p  pa The link which is sent in the email, when a user clicks it, it goes thru angular and then we display a wait page during which we call an API with details in the request params of the link and then based on the response we route it.p  por p  pb The user clicks on the link  he hits the laravel which validates everything and then reroute  it itself based on the verification.p  pI am asking this to clarify one more thing that is the difference when you are implementing a web server and app server ,so things like all the apis are available by app server that is understandable, but email verification links should they be handled by app server too or everything should go through web sever first.p

Negative 1188 pI may have discovered one of the problems in the code posted previously,  R using foreach with sample procedures in randomForest call and it relates to the script I was using to draw a random subsample of columns from a dataframe.  The fake data below has 19 columns, A through S and I want to draw a random subset of 5 columns, but I want to exclude the third column, C, from the draw.  Simply excluding the third column from the first argument of sample call does not work i.e., some of the samples contain the C column. Im hoping someone has a suggestion on how to do this.

Negative 1188 pWhen I use generatorangularfullstacks API to build routes, controllers, directives, whathaveyou, it appends naming conventions I dont like. For instance for all the module declarations it appends App, and Id prefer to not have App appended to my app name. Also, it uses Ctrl instead of Controller, and so on.p  pIm not seeing a json file that controls this behavior in my app or my angularfullstack npm files.

Negative 1188 pI have two tomcat 6 installations running on the same Redhat 5 machine  one is mine and one belongs to another group at my organisation.  Mine is currently 6.0.35, the other is 6.0.32.  I had a problem with the filenames being generated for the tomcat logs ending up with dates in them, which broke our log rotation, so I searched around on here and found that setting thep  p1catalina.org.apache.juli.FileHandler.rotatablep  pproperty to false removed the date, as per the documentation herep  pa hrefhttpstomcat.apache.orgtomcat6.0docapiorgapachejuliFileHandler.html relnofollowhttpstomcat.apache.orgtomcat6.0docapiorgapachejuliFileHandler.htmlap  pHurrah problem solved.  So I checked to see if the other installation was having the same problem it was, and they asked me to help them fix it.  Since their logging.properties setup was exactly the same as ours its all based on catalina.base I just copied over the new, fixed logging.properties file that works in our installation, and fixed the permissions.  But for some reason, here it doesnt work.p  pI can confirm from the commandline arguments of the running process that both are using the same logging.manager org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager and that the second installation is using the correct logging.properties config file.  I can even change other properties in that file e.g. prefix, suffix and restart the server to see them take effect in the filenames used.  But for whatever reason, the second installation seems to ignore the rotatablefalse property, and refuses to generate logfiles without dates in the name.

Then loaded them into one article with the following method    codeqB48wcodea hrefhttpjsfiddle.netqB48w relnofollowJSFiddlea. Here, when one uncomments a box, the rest of boxes get automatically centered.p  pWith the example above, I would like to be able to do the same with 4 boxes, all of them made in customhtml in Joomla 2.5.xp  pCan anyone help me with this challenge, or point me in the right direction p  pBest regard Jens.p

Negative 1188 pIm relatively new to Java and Im selfteaching.  Currently Im trying to develop a Frame which includes a text field and a button.

Instead of grabbing whats been typed in the field, it only gives me what the fields text is at default.p  pIm hoping someone could look at my code below and tell me where Im going wrong.

Negative 1188 pIm getting started with using size classes in one of my apps. Basically, I have an app that I designed using the standard square size class, but now I want to make more specific changes in different size classes. I have about four view controllers embedded in a navigation controller. They are all connected by various segues. When I change the size class, only the navigation controller visibly changes to a different aspect ratio in the storyboard. I think this is a segue issue because when I add a new view controller to the storyboard, I can successfully change the size class of it, but when I use a segue to connect it to another view controller that was made with the square anyH, anyW size class, it turns back into a square. Any idea how I can convert all the view controllers to one specific size classp

Negative 1188 pI have an image given as a 3D numpy array width, height and color as dimensions. Now I would like to extract all possible subimages of a given shape. For example, the width and height of the original image is 300 and 200 pixels, respectively, and I would like to extract all subimages with width and heights equal to 10 and 20 pixels, respectively. Moreover, each subimage I would like to have as 1D array for that I need to specify a particular ordering of pixels.p  pI solve the problem in the following wayp  precodefor col0 in rangewmax  maxshift     x3snew  [x  col0 for x in x3s]     for row0 in rangehmax  maxshift          vec1  []         for colshift, rowshift in pxinds             col  col0  colshift             row  row0  rowshift             vec1  [ia[row, col, 0], ia[row, col, 1], ia[row, col, 2]]          y3snew  [y  row0 for y in y3s]         vec2  listia[y3snew, x3snew, z3s] codepre  pIn the above code I make a loop over columns and rows of the matrix representing the image. Then each pixel given by its column and row I treat as the lefttop corner of the subimage and extract the subimage.p  pThe codevec1code and codevec2code are the desired subimages given as 1D arrays lists. They are identical, I just wanted to test what way is faster. Surprisingly, it take more time to generate codevec2code than codevec1code.

I assume there is no way but was interested because I would have thought this would be possible.p  pId like to define a type which is essentially a redefinition of an int but which can be distinguished between.  For example, an index which can access different overloaded functions depending what it is an index ofp  precodevoid ReturnSomeValueIndexA id void ReturnSomeValueIndexB id codepre  pIts not necessary, but I thought it would be nice to avoid accidentally passing the wrong index to a different function which is designed for the other thus triggering a compiler error no matching call for FunctionIndexB and not a potentially baffling logical error.p  pIve tried using typedefp  precodetypedef int IndexA typedef int IndexB codepre  pbut it seems these are both ints with a different name as far as the compiler is concerned.p  pThis will probably be possible using a class or a struct but will involve a lot of rewriting and seems a bit of an overkill for this simple issue.p  pThanks for any help, Id be interested to know if this was possiblep

Negative 1188 pIm tackling something Ive not dealt with before and would really appreciate some pointers to get me started.p  pIm creating a Web API project to bridgeinterface two other applications.  One application will be posting data not XML into my application of which I need to transform based on an XSD schema and then post back out to another application as XML.p  pIve successfully created C classes based on a couple of XSD schemas via the XSD.exe utility.  Also I have created a model to holdrecieve the posted data from application 1. I now need to reformat this data to meet the XML structure for application 2.p  pThe structure of the XML that I need to pass is similar to thisp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 ltNewItem xsischemaLocationhttpexample.com.. xmlnsxsihttpwwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xmlnshttpexample.com..gt ltCreateSystemIDgtMyAppID12345ltCreateSystemIDgt    ltSystemDetailsgt       ltColourgtGreenltColourgt       ltUsagegtHeaveyltUsagegt       ltBaseLocationgtTBAltBaseLocationgt    ltSystemDetailsgt  ltNewItemgt codepre  pI can post data to the controller which works fine and is stored in my holding model.

And a second schema which specs out the fields found in the SystemDetails section.p  pI wasnt sure how to concatenatestitch the two XSD schemas together.  So I concluded that I needed to create another C model.  Effectively creating the fields in a nested format, which to some degree recreates my XML structure.p  precodepublic class NewItemModel  public string CreateSystemID getset public SystemDetailsModel SystemDetailsModel get set   public class SystemDetailsModel   public string Colour getset public string Usage getset public string BaseLocation getset  codepre  pThe output from a transformation method Ive started to write does something like thisp  precodepublic IEnumerableltNewItemModelgt SetupNewItemIEnumerableltModelApp1gt passInItems  var items  passInItems.Selectx gt new  var CreateItem  NewItemModel     CreateSystemID  Test Entry,    SystemDetailsModel  new SystemDetailsModel     Colour  x.color    Usage  x.uses    BaseLocation  x.region    codepre  pHowever Im not sure how to get my method to convert this model so that I can post it out to application 2 in the XML structure I listed earlier.  p  pSo Im hoping someone out there has done something similar to this project and could shed some lightguidance on working with XSDs in this manner.  The end goal is to take data from application 1, inject it into a new model to meet the required structure for application 2 and then post it out as XML.p  pHopefully the above makes sense and apologies that my approachcoding must look rather backward.  Im not the strongest C programmer as its still quite new to me.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1188 pI inherited some 10 year old code I have to complete. The code is in MFC C.p  pTheres a .h file where the custom data structures are written and some const variables are in there as Globals. Some of these are used for MS Office file extensions, of type CString, and are declared as T.doc, T.xls, etc.p  pObviously these are dated and need to be updated to recognize the Office 2007 and later extensions. My first brilliant idea was to use constcast to change the constant if needed, but found out later thats a nono and resulted in undefined behavior sometimes it would switch back to .doc.p  pI then decided to create a struct and have two structs inherit from it. I created a void method in the base struct to make it abstract but otherwise it does nothing. Heres the codep  precodestruct eOfficeExtensions      const CString WORDEXTENSION     const CString EXCELEXTENSION     const CString WORDPADEXTENSION     const INT EXTENSION2007      eOfficeExtensionsCString word, CString excel, CString wordpad, INT ver           WORDEXTENSIONword, EXCELEXTENSIONexcel, WORDPADEXTENSIONwordpad, EXTENSION2007ver      method to ensure base class is abstract     virtual void Interface  0   struct eOfficeExtensions2003  public eOfficeExtensions  public       eOfficeExtensions2003  eOfficeExtensionsT.doc, T.xls, T.rtf, 0  private     virtual void Interface   struct eOfficeExtensions2007OrLater  public eOfficeExtensions       eOfficeExtensions2007OrLater  eOfficeExtensionsT.docx, T.xlsx, T.rtf, 1  private     virtual void Interface  codepre  pThis feels like a ridiculous amount of code for what should be a simple conditional definition. What would an experienced programmer dop  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThese constants should only be set once and never changed. The version of MS Office installed is determined by scanning registry subkeys in a class that deals with memory management. p  pThe constants are mainly used to create new files or search a directory for files with that extension, not for resolving conditional statements. The struct should also be instantiated once as a eOfficeExtensions pointer to the relevant child struct. p

Negative 1188 pSo, this was a question my professor posed in my OS class. I went home and played around with it, and it turns out you can create  files even after you make a directory readonly. Those files are not readonly until you explicitly set them to be readonly, either by modifying the permissions on the file itself or those of the directory again. p  pIt seems that every time you explicitly make a directory readonly, all the files in it become readonly, but every time you create a new file after that, it is not readonly. A readonly directory should place a sort of lock on the files in it, shouldnt it Is there a specific reason this happensp

Negative 1188 pI have a producer thread and a consumer thread, with the producer being realtime and determinismsensitive. p  pHence I decided to hoist the processing out of the producer thread into a consumer thread, using a lockfree fifo queue. The goal is to have the consumer being both responsive but also avoiding busywaiting, while never delaying the producer for a indeterminate amount of time thus any allocationslocks and kernel entries, I suppose etc. are completely out of the question.p  pIve implemented this pattern, which seems to work well, however Im unsure of why a mutex is needed at allp  precodestdmutex m stdconditionvariable cv  void consumer      stduniquelockltstdmutexgt lockm     while 1              cv.waitlock          process consumation...        void producer      while 1               produce and post..         cv.notifyone       codepre  pThe other canonical examples seems to lock the mutex in the producer as well, why My data communication is already threadsafe, so this shouldnt be needed.

Negative 1188 pIve been doing some digging through old SO questions about the inherent evilness of mutable structs, but as a C noob I cant tell whether this is an intended use of structs in c.p  pSo basically Im learning c by making a simple textbased dungeon game. I have codeEnemycode, codePlayercode, and codeAttackcode classes and an codeEffectcode Struct. Every codeAttackcode can have an codeEffectcode, and when the codePlayercode object attacks an codeEnemycode object, it uses its own codeAttackcode object to calculate damage, and then passes the codeAttackcodes codeEffectcode struct to the codeEnemycode where it is added to a list of Effects.p  pEffect has a duration field, which is decreased every turn until it reaches 0 via this method p  precodepublic void tick          duration  codepre  pEvery turn, the codeEnemycode iterates through the list of codeEffectscode, calling codetickcode and checking whether codedurationcode has reached 0. If it has, it removes the struct from the list.p  pNow is this bad, or is it one of the intended uses of structs Coming from a java background, Im used to doing this by codenewcodeing objects. Is that the way its supposed to be done in cp

Negative 1188 pWith unknown reason, boost binary serialization doesnt work occasionally. The parsed data is corrupted sometimes.p  pOriginally I serialized instances of selfdefined class manually, with each instance being a line in a text file. However, the speed was slow.The text file was dealt in a speed of 2 MBsec, which can be seen in windows task manager. Recently I changed to use the boost binary serialization. However, strange things happens.p  pI stored many many instances of class InstanceIdentity, which contains a string member variable and a struc member variable representing the xyz integer coordinates.p  pMy Problem The previous 504 instances can be parsed from the binary file successfully and printed to screen. However the 505th instance is falsely parsed.The xyz coordinates should be no more than 512. And then the following instances become a mess. And soon an unknown exception is thrown from boost. I tried to catch it and used the .what method to reveal more information. However, it only says codeUnknown Exceptioncode.p  precodeline 503 0294.sraw.gz 306, 215, 64 line 504 0294.sraw.gz 224, 154, 86 line 505 0294.sraw.gz 68109, 36608, 16384  Then the screen output becomes a mess.

Negative 1188 pSorry for a possible duplicate post, I saw many similar topics here but none was exactly I needed. Before actually posting a question I want to explicitly state that this question is NOT A HOMEWORK. p  pSo the question is how to convert a large integer number into binary representation The integer number is large enough to fit in primitive type Java long cannot be used. An input might be represented as a string format or as an array of digits. Disclaimer, This is not going to be a solution of production level, so I dont want to use BigInteger class. Instead, I want to implement an algorithm.p  pSo far I ended up with the following approach Input and output values represented as strings. If the last digit of input is even, I prepend the output with 0, otherwise  with 1. After that, I replace input with input divided by 2. I use another method  strongdivideByTwostrong for an arithmetical division. This process runs in a loop until input becomes 0 or 1. Finally, I prepend input to the output. Heres the codep  pHelper Methodp  precode  param s input integer value in string representation  return the input divided by 2 in string representation  static String divideByTwoString s      String result       int dividend  0     int quotent  0     boolean dividendIsZero  false      while s.length gt 0              int i  1                   dividend  Character.getNumericValues.charAt0          while dividend lt 2 ampamp i lt s.length                      if dividendIsZero result  0             dividend  Integer.parseInts.substring0, i                   quotent  dividend  2         dividend  quotent  2                     dividendIsZero  dividend  0          result  Integer.toStringquotent         s  s.substringi          if dividendIsZero ampamp s.length  0                      s  Integer.toStringdividend  s                   return result        codepre  pMain Methodp  precode  param s the integer in string representation  return the binary integer in string representation  static String integerToBinaryString s      if s.matches[09]              throw new IllegalArgumentExceptions   cannot be converted to integer           String result       while s.equals0 ampamp s.equals1              int lastDigit  Character.getNumericValues.charAts.length1         result  lastDigit  2  result if last digit is even prepend 0, otherwise 1         s  divideByTwos          return s  result.replaceAll0,   codepre  pAs you can see, the runtime is On2. On for strongintegerToBinarystrong method and On for strongdivideByTwostrong that runs inside the loop. Is there a way to achieve a better runtime Thanks in advancep
