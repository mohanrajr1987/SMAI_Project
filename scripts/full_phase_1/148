Positive 148 pI am working with Java of late, and was wondering whether there was any kind of interface implementation derivation in Java. My preferred programming language is Haskell, which is in many ways antithetical to Java, but one feature that I was wondering whether Java had anything like is the ability to derive interface implementations of compound types from the interface implementations of their parameters. For example, in Haskellp  precodedata Pair k v  Pair k v  instance Ord k gt Ord Pair k v where     compare Pair x  Pair x   compare x x codepre  pThis allows you to order a codePaircode if its first parameter can be ordered, without explicitly requiring that to be the case. However, the closest I can come  to this in Java is through explicit requirementp  precodeclass PairltK extends ComparableltKgt, Vgt extends ComparableltPairltK,Vgtgt      K k     V v     public int compareToPairltK,Vgt p          return k.compareTop.k       codepre  pWithout a way of leaving the comparability to be inferred, it is impossible for me to implement a BST of pairs without ensuring that all pairs have a comparable first element, so I cannot implement any kind of Map where the first element is not explicitly required to be Comparable. Is there any way around this, other than creating a method of my BST class that attempts to compare the generic type by casting it first as comparable, and then as a Pair with a comparable key, comparing whenever comparability is possiblep

Positive 148 pBackground I wanted to expand the .NET codeLazyltgtcode type to support implicit cast between codeLazyltTgtcode and the underlying codeTcode object to be able automatically unwrap the containing value.

Since variance modifiers are not allowed in class definitions, I had to resort to an empty interface to achieve thisp  precodepublic interface IExtendedLazyltout Tgt   codepre  pAnd changed my class definition to p  pcodepublic class ExtendedLazyltTgt  LazyltTgt, IExtendedLazyltTgtcodep  pThis works fine and I was able to make use of this covariant typep  precodeExtendedLazyltDerivedClassgt derivedLazy  new ExtendedLazyltDerivedClassgt IExtendedLazyltBaseClassgt baseLazy  derivedLazy codepre  pWhile this compiles and works fine, it goes against a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms182128.aspx relnofollowCA1040 Avoid empty interfacesa which says using empty interfaces as contracts is a bad design and a code smell and Im sure most people agree. My question is, given the inability of the CLR to recognize variant generic types in class definitions, what other ways are around this to make it more consistent with acceptable OO practices Id imagine Im not the only person facing this issue so am hoping to get some insight on this.p
Positive 148 pEDIT  Summary after solution had been givenp  pLinq query results are almost always presented with emvarem implicit type or with typed emIENumerablelt Tem like emIEnumerablelt intem. However simple more  generic emIEnumerableem is sufficientp  pString.Join does not have specialization for emIEnumerableem  but has naturally one for emIEnumerablelt Tem  and fall back to emString.Join Method String, Object[] ...em. It then assumes that the linq query result emresem is an array of Object of size 1.

Positive 148 pIm trying to get a proof of concept down for a feature I need in my code.  In the real application, I have a Dependency Injection container, and children sometimes need to new up an object, and I need the DI container to return that object.

Negative 148 pThe project Im working on is a piece of static HTML with some inline JavaScript that will call a REST webservice, which Im creating myself using .NET 3.5 WCF.p  pThe JavaScript will grab some details from the user including an email address, then send those details off to the webservice through Ajax. The webservice will then store the details in a database.p  pSince this is a webservice, Im pretty sure it would be stateless.p  pHowever, the requirement for the project is that the frontend JavaScript should also do a captcha, to prevent spamming.p  pThe site itself will only be up for a few weeks 6 weeks max, and I dont think thats enough time for any wouldbe attackers to get serious about bringing the site down.p  pFor this reason, Ive considered making an entirely clientside captcha, since traditional captcha requires a stateful sessions.p  pHowever Im curious to know what security measures would normally be implemented in a stateless environment, or if anyone thinks Im wrong about clientside captcha validation being sufficient.p

This of course results in my cells getting redrawn over and over again each time a user scrolls and on top of each other.p  p3 I also tried placing the drawing of the custom cell labels, graphics etc. inside the cell  nil block, but setting the labels.text property after the block. This cant be done as my   UILabels then cant be accessed from outside the block they were instantiated in. I could do some crazy forUILabel l in cell.contentView.subviews  but that would require an if statement for each label and probably some tags to identify them with.p  p4 I could then declare all my labels before the cell  nil block and then just do the instantiation and drawing inside the block and setting the text property after the cell  nil block. But as I passed 10 UIlabels this looks and feels really messy, having them spread out like this inside and outside the cell  nil block, plus they would be declared each time the table has to refresh.p  pThe reason I ask is because when using 24 labels I have always found a way around it, but this time I need 12 custom UILabels set up and I would like to do it so that I have to redraw the least amount of graphics, as there probably will be a lot of cells.p  pI have seen examples where people and the Apple docs uses ap  precode void configureCellUITableViewCell cell atIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath  codepre  pBut I cant really see how that would help me outp  pHope someone could point out a best practice for these sort of things.p  pThank youp

Negative 148 pI am using Linq to SQL to call a stored procedure which runs a fulltext search and returns the rank plus a few specific columns from the table codeArticlecode.  The rank column is the rank returned from the SQL function FREETEXTTABLE.

Id like to get this information so I can display it to the user.p  pSo far, Ive tried creating a new class codeRankedArticlecode which inherits from codeArticlecode and adds the column codeRankcode, then changing the return type of my sproc mapping to codeRankedArticlecode.

Negative 148 pIm developing an application winforms C .NET 4.0 where I access a lookup functionality from a 3rd party through a simple HTTP request. I call an url with a parameter, and in return I get a small string with the result of the lookup. Simple enough.p  pThe challenge is however, that I have to do lots of these lookups a couple of thousands, and I would like to limit the time needed. Therefore I would like to run requests in parallel say 1020. I use a ThreadPool to do this, and the short version of my code looks like thisp  precodepublic void startAsyncLookupActionltLookupResultgt returnLookupResult      this.returnLookupResult  returnLookupResult      foreach string number in numbersToLookup              ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemlookupNumber, number        public void lookupNumberObject threadContext      string numberToLookup  stringthreadContext     string url  httpsome.url.comnumber  numberToLookup     WebClient webClient  new WebClient     Stream responseData  webClient.OpenReadurl     LookupResult lookupResult  parseLookupResultresponseData      returnLookupResultlookupResult  codepre  pI fill up codenumbersToLookupcode a codeListltStringgtcode from another place, call codestartAsyncLookupcode and provide it with a callback function codereturnLookupResultcode to return each result. This works, but I found that Im not getting the throughput I want.p  pInitially I thought it might be the 3rd party having a poor system on their end, but I excluded this by trying to run the same code from two different machines at the same time. Each of the two took as long as one did alone, so I could rule out that one.p  pA colleague then tipped me that this might be a limitation in Windows. I googled a bit, and found amongst others a hrefhttpwww.pctools.comguidesregistrydetail536this posta saying that by default Windows limits the number of simultaneous request to the same web server to 4 for HTTP 1.0 and to 2 for HTTP 1.1 for HTTP 1.1 this is actually according to the specification RFC2068.p  pThe same post referred to above also provided a way to increase these limits. By adding two registry values to code[HKEYCURRENTUSERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet Settings]code MaxConnectionsPerServer and MaxConnectionsPer10Server, I could control this myself.p  pSo, I tried this sat both to 20, restarted my computer, and tried to run my program again. Sadly though, it didnt seem to help any. I also kept an eye on the Resource Monitor a hrefhttpimg708.imageshack.usimg7082306resourcemonitor.jpgsee screen shota while running my batch lookup, and I noticed that my application the one with the title blacked out still only was using two TCP connections.p  pSo, the question is, why isnt this working Is the post I linked to using the wrong registry values Is this perhaps not possible to hack in Windows any longer Im on Windows 7p  pAny ideas would be highly appreciated p  pAnd just in case anyone should wonder, I have also tried with different settings for MaxThreads on ThreadPool everyting from 10 to 100, and this didnt seem to affect my throughput at all, so the problem shouldnt be there either.p

Negative 148 pI have the following system configuredp  pTomcat  Apache p  pNow, I have some URLs on which I have MaxAge, LastModified and Etags set.  My expectation is when Client1 makes a call to the server, the page should get served from tomcat, but should get cached in the modcache module of Apache. So that when next client makes a call, the page is served from Apache and it doesnt have to hit the Tomcat server, if the page is still fresh. If the page isnt fresh, Apache should make a Conditional Get to validate the content it has.p  pCan someone tell me if there is any fundamental mistake in this thinking It doesnt happen to work that way. In my case, when client2 makes a call, it goes straight to the Tomcat servernot even a Conditional Get. p  pIs my thinking incorrect or my Apache configuration incorrect Thanksp

Negative 148 pThis is a question to proxy and plugin developers.p  pThe usual mindset when it comes to specific sites is emThey make changes which breaks our plugin we change the logic to make it work againem.p  pBut, what if the other side worries about this too If we want to compile a set of guidelines and best practices for site development for a proxyfriendly site, what do you suggest should go to it Think of the tough nuts youve had to crack. Do you remember those moments you wished the site developer had done a certain feature differently Howp  pSince this is concerned with coding, I dont think it should go to serverfault.p  pEdit After reading Pekkas comment I feel I should add some more background information.p  pThere are web proxy scripts out there such as glype and PHProxy. As the script should cope with many unknown conditions it fails to serve many sites. Because the number of such sites is overwhelming it does not make sense to try to make the proxys internal logic sophisticated enough to handle this huge variety. This is where plugins come in handy. The main or embaseem script implements a mechanism to invoke plugin code on a per site bases.p  pSo, if the proxy fails to serve lets say facebook.com, which is the case by the way, a coder interested in the challenge does some research and debugging, to find where and why the chain is broken and what should be done to resolve the issue. The coder implements his fix as a plugin for that particular site and users could drop the plugin into their plugins directory.p  pBut it also happens that something on the site changes, and that change causes the plugin to break again. So it is a constant match to catch up with the most recent changes of a site. The irony of the situation is that many site developers neither know, nor care about the impact their design decisions may have on emproxy serveabilityem of the content. But some sites have good reason to care about the ability of visitors to access their content through proxies. Dont want to get into politics here, so I leave it to you to guess why this might be important to some sites.p  pThis question is an attempt to tap into the collective knowledge and experience of proxy and plugin authors to make a set of guidelines for making a site proxyfriendly.p  pemI didnt tag the question php originally as it mostly concerns output of a site, not how you generate it. But decided to tag it so, because it will improve visibility of the question and the tag could be justified on target audience basis as well. Im making this community wiki also, so if you feel php tag should be removed, just do so.emp

Negative 148 pI have a WCF service that has been working flawlessly for 3 months.  It is consumed by local clients on the same server hosting the WCF service and local network clients.  It uses SSL and basic authentication for security.p  pA few nights ago, the local client local network clients not affected started receiving 404 errors whenever it tried to use the service.  I am able to open a browser on the server hosting the WCF and view the WSDL and even call the put command and get the expected method not allowed.  I have confirmed that no software or hardware changes have been made to the hosting server.  I have confirmed that the SSL key is valid.  I have confirmed that the permissions for the Application Pool are sufficient.  I have confirmed that no firewall is running.  The only thing odd is the IIS log showing that the first post does not contain the basic authentication user.  However, the next line in the log does and shows a 200 response.  I am not entirely sure that log is not normal.  See below.  I was hoping somebody could give me another place to research to find the problem.

The local network clients are transferring small files and not throwing the error.  I found this a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSwcfthread7805475e0efe4a1e8cb500101a61e9a9 relnofollowlinka that suggests that the default transferModeBuffered will throw a 404 for files above 20 MB file.  The fix for this person was to change the transferModeStreamed.  However, the Streamed setting only allows 1 parameter to be passed to the WCF service.  I have multiple parameters so I need to find a fix for buffered mode.p

For reasons beyond my control, we have the entire BlazeDS distribution in our SVN project directory under codesrcmainresourcesblazedscode.

Tomcat and our RIA application work and everything is fine.p  pThe problem is, Eclipse tries to compile everything under codesrcmainresourcesblazedscode when running AutoBuild and this generates about 300 errorswarnings in our problem view.

Therefore support for asynchronous tests is important to me.p  pThe issue Im raising here is not related to View testing, which I have handled with some success in the past using System.Windows.Automation.Peers, and  although I have not used it yet  could possibly now handle more easily with the support in VS 2010 Feature Pack 2 which appears to be targeted at automation  playback of UI tests from what I gather.p  pI should mention that my findings from the products Ive looked at and used so far are as followsp  ul liSilverlight Unit Test Framework  I currently use this, and its great as far as it goes, but its limitations are a it is not integrated with Visual Studio and b if you dont want to run all tests, you are limited to the crude tag expression filter.li liStatLight  very nice.  I currently use this, and have used it since v0.9 when targeting Silverlight 3 on a previous project.  Being a commandline tool, it can be integrated with a continuous integration server  which certainly handles another required scenario.  But it is of no use directly in terms of Visual Studio integration during the development process.li liUnit Test Result Viewer for Silverlight Visual Studio extension on the Visual Studio gallery  looks promising, but its limitations are a currently fails to find projects which are located in solution folders, rather than under the solution root and b runs emallem tests in a given assembly via StatLight, with no apparent ability to run a specific test, or a selection of tests.li liEinar Ingebrigtsens Silverlight Unit Test Runner for ReSharper, which later became Odin  ahead of the game it first appeared in 2008, but the limitation is that it appears that this project is no longer maintained most recent update is Apr 2009.li liAgUnit ReSharper plugin  a hrefhttpagunit.codeplex.comhttpagunit.codeplex.coma   looks excellent initially. After downloading the source code for it and building the latest bugfixed version to work against ReSharper 5.1, I was very encouraged.  But unfortunately it does not handle asynchronous tests.  This is a design limitation with the threading, so it does not matter whether you try to use the asynchronous support that is built into Silverlight Unit Test Framework Microsoft.Silverliht.Testing.SilverlightTest base class, or whether youre using AutoResetEvent or anything else.  This has been noted by the coordinator on the projects discussion forum on CodePlex.  This is a massive limitation.li liTestDriven.NET 3.0  appears to have support for Silverlight 4.0 tests at first glance, but the limitation I suspect is Silverlight 4 assembly portability i.e. the 5 dependent assemblies that are portable between SL4 and .NET 4.  Certainly, when I tried using it with a simple POC, it crashed my instance of VS 2010.li ul  pPerhaps Ive missed something here  I wonder if anyone in the community has any better ideas for Silverlight unit testingp

Negative 148 pHitting a wall with this one, hope someone can lend a hand.  I have a wrapper div containing many fixedwidth content divs.  Its like a table, except that the number of items per row arent fixed, so that whenever the screen size is wide, more items fit onto the screen.  Pretty basic.  p  pAlso, each of these content divs has an adjacent details div that is hidden by default styledisplaynone, and an adjacent separator div that is empty, containing only the style clearboth.  p  pEach contentdetailsseparator div has a unique number in its ID, so that I can tell they are related e.g., content123, details1234, separator1234p  pNow, when one of these content divs is clicked, I want to reveal its details div below it.  That part, Ive got working partially, by wrapping an anchor tag around the content div, which fires an onClick javascript event, which in turns runs a jQuery statement to make visible the details and separator divs codejQuery.details1234.cssdisplay,blockcodep  pBut you can imagine my problem.  Once that separator div is reveled, it pushes down clears any content divs that appears to the right of it, ugly.  My thought, what I have been wrestling with for hours, is to reveal the separator div of the content div, that is the last one appearing in the row that was clicked.  That way, a new row will be opened up by the separator, so that when the content div is revealed it appears below the clicked item in the new row. To do that, I need to figure out the elementID of the last content div in the row, and I was thinking about using the Ycoord of the mouse click event, plus the Xcoord  to the rightmost edge of the wrapper div minus half the width of the fixedwidth content div. Something like that.  But I am smashed into a wall and cant figure it out.p  pCan anyone help me do that  Or offer a different solution If sample code would help let me know, I could whip up an example, but it may take some screen space in this post.p  pThanks everyone.. going nuts with this.p  pEDIT  the sample code below is based on my site.  When a cell is clicked, you can see its details div appear below it, but unfortunately the other divs in the row get pushed down.  that is the effect Im trying to avoid.  When a cell is clicked, I want the details to appear below it, but also the other divs to stay in their positions above the other cells details, basically I want to keep the row intact.  In the code, you can see my fruitless experiments using a separator div, because my assumption is that if I can insert that after the last div in the row, then the details div will become the next row, followed then by the next row of cells.

Negative 148 pRecently, I spent some time working on getting boost version 1.44.0 built on windows with both iostreams support for both zlib amp bzip2 compression filters. For a variety of reasons, it was decided to allow boost to build both zlib amp bzip2 libraries from source. For what its worth, but I dont think it matters, the version of MSVC Im using is VC9 VS2008. Also note that from my superficial examination, this issue should apply to any version of boost with iostreams built against bzip2 on windows.p  pBoost built cleanly by specifying codesZLIBSOURCEltPATHgtcode and codesBZIP2SOURCEltPATHgtcode. However, it was noticed that the boostiostreams.dll libs depended on libbz2.dll instead of boostbzip2.dll, which did not exist. Boost, did however successfully build boostbzip2.dll. Note that Im using the wildcard as a placeholder for the all of the build variant information.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pSomewhere a hardcoded dependency to libbz2.dll exists.p  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pThe simplest solution I found, was to modify libbz2.def included with the bzip2 source. Namely, delete the line as of bzip2 v1.0.6, it is line 1p  precodeLIBRARY         LIBBZ2 codepre  pRemoving this line eliminates the hardcoded dependency to a DLL named libbz2.dll. This then allows the boostbuilt libs named boostbzip2.dll and generated .lib and .exp files to properly resolve to the correspondingly named DLL, as well as export all necessary functions.p  pstrongApologiesstrongp  pSorry for posting a selfanswering question, but I did not find any solution to this particular problem on the internet, or on SO. Ill also post the above solution as an answer, but will leave it unaccepted for a while in case someone comes up with a cleaner solution. i.e. one that can be done that still allows boost to build the zlib amp bzip2 libs from source, but doesnt require any modifications at all to boost or bzip2 source.p

Negative 148 pI have an application, built on CF3.5 and Im trying to work out how to deploy this to the device.  Ive created a deployment project, and that deploys the software fine.  p  pHowever, the project has an app.config file to hold some running parameters.  p  pWhat I need to be able to do is to produce the CAB file, and allow the config to be changed before it is synced to the device changing it once its on the device is not viable.  The problem I have is that if I include this in the setup project, then it will be included in the produced CAB file and end up in the application directory on the device.p  pIm aware that the contents of the CAB file can be changed, but this is quite a cumbersome process.  It there a way to have the installation program just copy a file named app.config from the same directory as the CAB file to wherever the program is installed  Alternatively, is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 148 pJust wondering if anyone has any advice on the best approach to take for setting up cron jobs for scripts that run within Expression Engine.p  pAt the moment my plan is to use a cron job to access a URL with Lynx. The URL will be a random string so it cant be stumbled upon but will be publicly accessible. The cron job will load the URL, and the script will run as part of expression engine.p  pIt seems the ideal way to run these scripts though would be to get a cron job to run a PHP script internally, but at this time I need it to run things from within the EE framework so calling my module script would fail as it wouldnt be piped in. p  pHow could I pipe this in to work or should I just go with plan Ap

Negative 148 pI read through Python 3.2 changes and understand that it has made many improvement over 3.1. However, my exact same code with zero modification running on 3.2 is more than 10 times slower than when I run my code on 3.1.3p  pIt took Python 3.2 six minutes to transfer binary content of a file to a physical device then receive and prints out the received data on screen, when the exact same scenario on same PC only takes 30 second to execute with Python 3.1.3.p  pI developed my code from scratch with Python 3.1.2 and 20 of my code uses ctypes to perform transaction through windows driver with USBPCI device, so I dont think this performance hit has anything to do with backward compatibility. In my application, I create four instances of threading.Thread subclasses, each dealing with one PCI or USB device on the system.

Negative 148 pI am trying to extract human from a video source, so that I can use his image later. I need to only extract human body, and ignore the environment. The good thing is that the background is static. I have tried to use AForge and applied CustomFrameDifferenceDetector filter, which compares current frame to the static background image and extracts the pixels which differ differencethreshold. It works well, but there is a problem when skin or part of the clothing has the similar color to background. In these cases filter ignores these parts and the result has various holes in the body. Simply decreasing threshold doesnt solve the problem, since body shadows and other noise increases even under noise supression. p  pDo you know of any known solution to this problem Or is it still unsolved problemp
Negative 148 pIm trying to create a server that takes JSONRPC requests from a client, transforms those into nontrivial SOAP requests to a SOAP server, then takes the SOAP response and sends the client a transformed JSON response.

Negative 148 pIve created an android app that is so far working quite well. It contains a local service which is responsible for getting the users location every couple of minutes and relaying that via UDP to a collection server which is in turned displayed on a web application map.p  pThe app needs to be constantly running unless the user explicitly signs out of the application. Currently, it seems the OS is shutting down the service and restarting it as needed. I can see this because normally it would report its location consistently every 2 minutes. Instead, there are gaps in these intervals.p  pSo Im looking for some advice on how I can write a service which at the batterys expense unfortunately can stay running always and pool the location service just enough to send accurate fixes at a 2 minute interval.p  pI have a well working code base so far, so if demonstrating where I currently am with code would help, dont hesitate to ask.p  pThanks in advance to those that lend a hand.p

Negative 148 pI have a program that simulates bestfit memory management. Basically, while there are available holes in the holes list, large enough for a process we are trying to allocate, processes are allocated and added to the process list. However, eventually, we get to a point where holes become very fragmented and we need to perform compaction. p  pThe easiest way to do this, is obviously to create a new list and add all the processes in sequential order. However, that is not very realistic, since in real world, you wouldnt have space to move things to and create a new list. p  pCan you think of a way to push all the processes to one end of memory and free space to the other Basically it is set up like this array of holes holes are structs that contain starting index and size and an array of processes processes are also structs that contain process id, starting index and size. p

Negative 148 pIm running a 32 bit ver of win7 in a vm. I am trying to reference 5 com dlls VB6 in my .net project. These dlls and their dependencies are registered ok since I can use them natively as they form a part of another app and that app is working fine. p  pI try to set a reference to any of them directly in vs and I get the error message  Library not registered Exception from HRESULT 0x8002801D TYPEELIBNOTREGISTERED.p  pHowever, if I set a reference to another com component which I dont want to reference but which in turn does reference these libs I find that the references to these com dlls which I do want to reference gets set correctly in vs. I then just need to remove the ref to the unwanted dll and everything seems to be good to go.p  pIf I look at the GUID and version details of one of the successfully referenced component, they appear to be the same as the GUID and version that appears in the caption of the error form, when I unsuccessfully try and set a reference to the same component directly.p  pBTW I have tried repairing the VS installation to no availp  pI was wondering if someone could explain what I am doing wrong.p  pEDIT Followup following Hans suggestionp  pSo I ran p  precodetlbimp mylib.dll codepre  pand it returned a TI1006 error  Output would overwrite the input file. So following suggestions found, I then issuedp  precodetlbimp mylib.dll OUTinterop.mylib.dll codepre  pand this then returned the error p  pTlbImp  warning TI3011  Type library importer has encountered an interface not derived from IUnknown HiddenInterface.

I have tried with a dll which doesnt reference ADODB and that seems to work using tlbimp. So, e.g.p  precodetlbimp myNONADODBlib.dll OUTinterop.myNONADODBlib.dll codepre  pworks from the commandline. However p  precodetlbimp myNONADODBlib.dll codepre  pstill generates the error TI1006  output file will overwrite input file, and I cannot reference this into my .net projectp  pEDITp  pThere seems to be a problem with ADO and Win7 SP1. a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb2517589 relnofollowhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb2517589a which would account for the deprecated error message TI1033 I was getting, but not why VS was failing to create a CCW for the dll I can manually create a CCW via tlbimp.p  pEDIT 120328 1040 p  pSo I have rebuilt the com dll with the suggested tlb. I can now successfully run p  precodetlbimp mylib.dll codepre  pwithout getting any error messages and it appears to complete successfully. However, when I try and add a reference to that dll in VS, I still get the same original error message  Library not registered Exception from HRESULT 0x8002801D TYPEELIBNOTREGISTERED.

My problem is, that I cant figure out how to pull this off.

Negative 148 pI am building an app that takes a few different text files and strings them together, then builds a pdf out of them. I needed to add the files text add separate times so I can add in hyperlinks to the text from each file. I have made some progress and got it to display almost accurately, but it appears CTFramesetterCreateWithAttributedString is not sizing correctly.p  pFor example, the first of the three files displays too much, in other words, after the text ends there is a blank page that comes after it. The second text file displays just fine, but the third has a large chunk from the beginning missing. I do not believe it has anything to do with the files themselves, because I get the same problem if I reverse the order in which the files are rendered. The first file whichever file it is has a blank page at the end, and the third file has the first page or so missing.

Negative 148 pThis issue is better demonstrated than explained, so Ive set up a a hrefhttpsgithub.comDanStevensTableLayoutSizingIssueTestgit repoa with Visual Studio 2010 project that be used to see the issue in action.p  pI have a project where Ive added a ComboBox control codecomboFieldcode to a TableLayout control codetableLayoutPanel1code. Ive set the codeDockcode property of the ComboBox to codeFillcode so that it fills the cell of the TableLayout control that it has been placed in. Ive also set the codeDockcode property of the TableLayout control to codeFillcode so that it fills the Form that it has been placed on. The width of the ComboBox is currently 193 pixels.p  pWhen I run the form and increase its width, the size of the ComboBox increases, as expected. When I reduce the size of the form, the ComboBox reduces in size emuntilem it reaches its original size 193 pixels. At which point, the width of the ComboBox will not decrease any further, resulting in the righthand side of the control being clipped. This is contrary to what I would expect the width of the ComboBox will decrease to zero, given that no codeMinimumSizecode has been specified. Neither has a codeMinimumSizecode been specified for any of the other controls on the form, such as the TableLayout control.p  pIn case it is relevant, the width of the first column of the TableLayout has is set to an codeAbsolutecode size of 100 pixels, while the width of the second column of the TableLayout has been set to codeAutoSizecode.p  pCan anyone shed any light on why this form is behaving contrary to my expectations and advise on how I can get this working in the way I want Any help would be much appreciated.p

I am running visual studio 2005 and Access 2007, updating the database to 2007 rather than compatibility mode is possible but not ideal , however my current code cant access it.p  pThank you for your helpp  pJoshp

Negative 148 pI have a Java GUI that takes video frames into a byte array, and saves them directly to a raw output file.  I am able to then load this file into MATLAB and execute my signal processing algorithm.  However, the raw file ends up being about 1GB and takes a very long time to open in MATLAB.p  pCurrently I use a Process, inside a SwingWorker to run an instance of MATLAB and have the algorithm execute and generate the results.  This is all working correctly, but the loading the 1GB raw file into MATLAB is very slow, on the order of 30 seconds.  p  pI am wondering if there is anyway to directly pass the Java byte array to MATLABp  pThanks in advancep

Also wanted to mention that there are obviously many other flaws with this program it is far from robust. That is because it is far from finished. You dont have to bring these issues to my attention, I will work on them after I get this bug sorted out. Thanks for giving this a look  EDIT My problem is fixed, however Id still like to keep this open for a little while to see if anyone could elucidate exactly why my original code did not work.p
Negative 148 pstrongGoalstrong Generate a spreadsheet with worksheets named off of tables and column names listed on the first row of each worksheet.

So obviously tree cannot be reloaded and assigned codeFocusedNodecode from within the codeOnNewTextcode event.p  pI implemented delayed call to reload new tree and reassign codeFocusedNodecode  by implementing a quick and dirty timer could have used PostMessage for delayed function call but this is just a dumb example  after assigning within a timer it no longer NULL and works as expected.p  pCan anyone point me what is the optimal way to implement reloading of the tree  like a particular event to use in which it is safe to set new codeFocusedNodecode and it wont be reassigned back to NULL Is delayed function call the only way to achieve this or is there a better event to trap for example if one occurs after codeOnNewTextcode if this one doesnt allow setting focused node. Of course this works but I am interested if there is a better way to do this.p

Negative 148 pI have a game that will show a game over screen when the game is over. In order to start a new game from the game over screen the user is prompted to press the space bar. In my game the user presses and can hold the space bar to perform an attack. In my thread, if and when the users or the AIs health diminishes toor below zero then the game over screen is shown. Therefore, there is a good chance that when the game over the space bar will be down and therefore the game over screen flickers for a split second and the game is started in order to make things smoother instead of a traditional keyPress statement I am using booleans that affect a thread which runs the repaint function. My question is what is the syntax or command I need to put in to imitate the screen being releasedp

The loop is not infinite the problem occurs for a specific search between 9,00010,000 legitimate searches  I need it to keep going. Im using tailrecursion I think and that may be part of my problem, since I gather that C does not do this well. However, Im not sure how to avoid using tailrecursion in my case.p  pstrongQuestions.strong Why is the StackOverflowException occurring Does my overall approach make sense If the design sucks, Id rather start there, rather than just avoiding an exception. But if the design is acceptable, what can I do about the StackOverflowExceptionp  pstrongCode.strong The class Ive written searches for contacts about 500 from a specified list in a large amount of text about 6MB. The strategy Im using is to search for the last name, then look for the first name somewhere shortly before or after the last name. I need to find each instance of each contact within the given text. The StringSearcher class has a recursive method that continues to search for contacts, returning the result whenever one is found, but keeping track of where it left off with the search.p  pI use this class in the following mannerp  precodeStringSearcher searcher  new StringSearcher     File.ReadAllTextFilePath,     lastname,     firstname,     30   string searchResult  null while searchResult  searcher.NextInstance  null       do something with each searchResult  codepre  pOn the whole, the script seems to work. Most contacts return the results I expect. However, The problem seems to occur when the primary search string is extremely common thousands of hits, and the secondary search string never or rarely occurs.

So maybe Im posing my question in a way that is unanswerable.  Let me try adding some context.p  pMy app is assembling data from multiple Twitter API calls of different types as specified by Twitter.  Im not building tables for display.  I just want the data in ivars and eventually managed objects.  The app has a lot to do other than just get the Twitter data, so I dont want to put too much of the structure of my app inside a single performRequestWithHandler block just so I can access its returned data at some point. To me, getting the data from the net is a utility operation, not the sole app design determinant.  Some of my API calls depend specifically on data gathered from other types of API calls executed earlier in a specific order. p  pI need to know when those previous calls have finished so I can use the ivar values I set from their data objects.p  pThat is, I need a way to make API call1, assign assorted return data to ivars, do other stuff with the ivars outside the performRequestWithHandler block, make API call2 and 3, etc., based on what call1 and subsequent API calls returned, and eventually shuffle off to other viewControllers to display the processed data from the multiple API calls return values in various ways.p  pI totally get that performRequestWithHandler is executed on an unspecified thread which will get executed Idontknowwhen. Im not worried about UI long waits due to synced network access latency because I intend to specify very short wait times.  Im not going to make my users sit around waiting for a slow network connection  If the connection is slow, Ill show an activity indicator briefly and give up waiting quickly to show an alert.  That part of the app isnt my challenge of focus here.p  pMy challenge is assembling the returned data from multiple performRequestWithHandler calls in one place emafterem some or all of them have finished.p  pIt looks to me like performRequestWithHandler may be too high level a call to achieve the kind of sync control and data access I need. I dont know.p  pThe code example above was just the simplest way I could think of to isolate and demonstrate my problem in a simple way that compiles. Ive tried many variants but no joy so far.p  pHope this helps clarify the design idea Im working with.p  pThanks for any specific help, clues or ideas you may be able to offer.

Negative 148 pI am trying to retrieve links programatically that use javascript for their retrieval. For this purpose I have decided to use Selenium which has been suggested by many for this purpose. The machine is command line based linux machine on which I am going to execute has Python2.4 ruby1.8.5 and perl 5.8.8 and I can strictly use the above mentioned versions only for this task in any programming language mentioned.  Being an absolute beginner I am getting confused with lot of terms with selenium and its compatibility with the above mentioned versions of programming language. I tried reading a hrefhttpdocs.seleniumhq.orgdocs03webdriver.jsp relnofollowhttpdocs.seleniumhq.orgdocs03webdriver.jspa but was just lost in all those terms related to selenium.

Negative 148 pI have a UItableViewCell defined from a XIB file. This cell contains a UIScrollView, which is filled on the fly with UIView Objects  viewXY . I use arc, everywhere in the code. The UI looks likep  pcell 0  [ view00   view01 view02 ...]p  pcell 1  [ view10   view11 view12 ...]p  petc..., where [   ] is a cell content, which is horizontally scrollable.p  pProblem I profiled the app, and as I scroll emdownem vertically, the memory footprint grows rapidly, and as far as I could see, never goes back to normal, nor reaches a plateau. More importantly, if I scroll down a few cells and then back up, memory increases too.... p  pI checked for leaks with the instrument tool, nothing.p  pI narrowed down the problem around the part of the code that creates the viewXY . If I usep  precodemyDisplay viewXYmyDisplay is a UIView subclass gtviewXY  [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamedAWUIVE ownerself optionsnil][0] [scrollView addSubviewviewXY] codepre  pMemory grows out of control as I flip through the cells. The NIB is a simple UIViewUIImageView2 Labels.... If I replace sayp  precodeUIImageView viewXY  [UIImageView alloc] initWithImage[blablabla]] [scrollView addSubviewviewXY] codepre  pEverything is fine. The emLive Bytesem in instruments reaches rapidly a plateau.p  pAs part of the tests, I load the NIB file without exercising any of the methods defined in its custom class, so it comes out with the IBOutlets as defined in the IB default label text, image etc....p  pThis stuff is driving me crazy.p  pSuggestions to understand what Im doing wrong are most welcome.p

Negative 148 pI am trying to create a simple WCF service to handle various security scenarios, but am not really sure where to begin. p  pThe WCF service will be hosted on IIS most likely.

I need to be able to access various methods for both types, though the authenticated users should have access to additional methods. p  pI would like to be able to check HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated I assume this would be the easiest way to determine which type of user  or would it be ServiceSecurityContext.Current.WindowsIdentity and access a roles database. The service will be accessed by both a .net 4.0 website not webforms app and not mvc and other external sources that may or may not be .net java app or java web site, for instance.p  pI am unclear as to where to begin. What type of bindings, transports, security modes. Can I use a membershiproles provider SimpleMembership or the older asp.net membership with the servicep  pIf I want to have different types of anonymous users, do they need to be mapped to a specific active directory users for different roles or can I also include some sort of usernamepassword to authenticatep  pI also need to be able to use impersonation, so that assuming the correct rights, actions performed by one user can appear as if done by another. p  pI have been looking at various options and getting confused. ADFS, WIF, Microsoft.IdentityModel.dll, ACS 2.0, etc.p  pNot sure what is best, what is overkill, what will and will not meet the needs, what will be relatively easy to implement.

Negative 148 pTHERE ARE NO ERRORS IN MY LOGCATp  pI have my notification being launched from a timer which then sets off a broadcastreciever that triggers my notification. This all works fine and when a user unlocks the screen and then presses the notification it properly launches the activity. However when the screen is locked and a user pulls down the notification bar and launches the activity from there it causes the app to crash instead of launching. p  pIs this because there is no current backstack or valid context for the map There should be because when I unlock the screen first it works. p  pAlso Ive run through some basic tests and have close the app completely then turned off the screen and opened it back up and tried when its locked and got the crash and then Ive also opened the app after the screen is unlocked it works perfect.p  pSo....why would having the screen locked make a difference and cause the app to crash when launching the notifications intent from the lockscreen.p

Negative 148 pI know that my approach isnt practical, but this is going to help me get used to Java a bit more. I am trying to create a JButton subclass named MyButton. MyButton basically will create a new Gui button, with a custom image background. I know how to create a new button in the class, but dont know how to refer to the button that the MyButton class creates. As the code shows, the buttons icon needs to be set, but this needs to be done inside the subclass, so that said used doesnt have to use it. On creation, the coder inputs the string that refers to the texture, and then the MyButton has all the properties of a JButton, but also already has its image set. Below is my source code.p  precodepackage Classes import javax.swing.ImageIcon import javax.swing.JButton  public class MyButton extends JButton private static final long serialVersionUID  1L  public JButton abc  new JButton private ImageIcon def private MyButton ghi  public MyButtonString image      def  new ImageIcongetClass.getResourceimage      abc.setIcondef     abc.setPressedIcondef      ghi  new MyButtonimage.png     ghi.setIcondef     codepre  pstrongUPADTEstrong Solved it.

Negative 148 pI have written a script in Python 3.3 which reads position x, y coordinate and risk values from a text file and saves the resulting contour plot using matplotlib.  My company needs to be able to edit the contour in AutoCAD.  Unfortunately, my knowledge about AutoCAD is severely limited, and the people at my company who know AutoCAD know very little about generating contour plots.  p  pHow can I create a contour plot that can be imported in AutoCAD  My current thinking is that I should save the plot as an svg file and convert it to something AutoCAD can open, or install a plugin for AutoCAD that will allow it to open one of the formats that matplotlib can save.  I have seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3837777svg2dxfconversionthis questiona but that does not quite suit my needs.p  pEditp  pI have tried saving the plot as an SVG file, opening it in a hrefhttpinkscape.org relnofollowInkscapea, and saving it as DXF, but it does not save the contour color information, and the task needs to be automated anyway.  The contour color information is important to preserve because the color indicates the order of magnitude of risk.p

I was able to solve this by just surrounding the entry with this string while creating the filep  pstrongHYPERLINKa hrefhttpmyurl.comhttpmyurl.comastrongp  pWhen Excel loads, the link is clickable and the mouse pointer changes to the hand icon. The only problem is that when you are just looking at it and not hovering the cell, it just looks like black text on a white background. Usually when you see a link, it is blue with an underline signifying that it is clickable. I would like to have this visual queue, but I am not sure if there is a way of doing it just by modifying my function above with some sort of cell formatting function or something.p  pAnd Yes, I know what conditional formatting is and how to apply it to a cell in Excel. However, this will not work for me, because I just need it to work when the file is loaded. The file is always created new when a user downloads it, because the contents are always changing. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 148 pI cannot get sound to play for videos on my ipad 4 from a standalone web app, running ios 6.1.3. Check out this fiddle at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net6YVAH relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net6YVAHap  pRun it just about anywhere that supports HTML5 video, including within the regular Safari browser on the iPad, and the video clip runs just fine, sound and video. Save it as a chromeless standalone iPad desktop web app, however, and the video plays with no sound. I have also experimented with audio files, and again no sound when saved to the desktop.p  pThe html is about is simple as you can possibly get. You can fix it by removing the applemobilewebappcapable meta tagp  precode ltmeta nameapplemobilewebappcapable contentyes gt    codepre  pbut that eliminates the possibility of saving to the desktop as a chromeless app, which is my requirement. Anyone know a workaround, or is this just a bug in ios 6.1.3 that will hopefully get fixed in 7.0p

Negative 148 pIm building an application that makes a userspecified number of calls to codecanvas.putImageDatacode in Javascript. Between each call to codeputImageDatacode, the image data is modified. The time needed to modify the data varies between calls. The user also needs to be able to stop the animation while its running Im using a button. Initially I usedp  precodefor var i0 i lt n i      canvas.putImageDataimgdata, 0, 0     modifyimgdata  codepre  pHowever, this doesnt display each frame, only the last one. What does work is to put an alert after codecanvas.putImageDatacode, but thats super annoying. I tried using codesetIntervalcode and codecancelIntervalcode as Im sure many would suggest, but this doesnt work for me for two reasonsp  ul liThe time needed to modify the image data varies.li lisetInterval is asynchronous if the delay I use is too short, calls to modifyimgdata pile up on the stack and users wont be able to stop the animation when they want.li ul  pHow can I make this work correctlyp

This way I never need to expire CloudFront content, I just redirect the ajax loading it.p  pBut then I have the issue of the JSON needing to be cached.

I know memcache and rack can help me speed that up, but its a problem I just dont want to have.p  pSome ideas Ive hadp  ul liMaybe there is a third party service, similar to a Memcache db, that allows me to be expose a value in a JSON url  That way my dynamos are never touched.li liMaybe there is an alternative to Cloudfront that allows for quicker manual expiration I know that kinda defeats the nature of caching, but maybe there more intermediary services, like a varnish layer or something.li ul

Negative 148 pId like to understand better why choose codeintcode over codeunsignedcodep  pPersonally, Ive never liked signed values unless there is a valid reason for them.  e.g. count of items in an array, or length of a string, or size of memory block, etc., so often these things cannot possibly be negative.  Such a value has no possible meaning.  Why prefer codeintcode when it is misleading in all such casesp  pI ask this because both Bjarne Stroustrup and Chandler Carruth gave the advice to prefer codeintcode over codeunsignedcode a hrefhttpchannel9.msdn.comEventsGoingNative2013InteractivePanelAskUsAnythinghere approx 1230a.p  pI can see the argument for using codeintcode over codeshortcode or codelongcode  codeintcode is the most natural data width for the target machine architecture.p  pBut signed over unsigned has always annoyed me.  Are signed values genuinely faster on typical modern CPU architectures  What makes them betterp

Negative 148 pI have a local version of a clients site running in a Wordpress installation on my machine with MAMP. The website contains a PayPal donation form that was written by another developer but left unfinished until the client had set up a PayPal account. The client now has the account, and has hired me to make the donation form live. Obviously I want to test this before I flip the switch to make it live on their site.

Also, Ive tested other sites with similar PayPal forms successfully on this installation of MAMP.

I then made my files hosted on my website to take off the whopping 197mb off the app to make it lighter and uploadable, but it gave me a Application error the connection to the server was unsuccessful I then tried using the webview code and used it with the example www.google.com , that worked fine. I tried using my site, and it would change the color of the screen to the bg in my site, BUT nothing else would show up. So then I tried making a simple html file with just a small text and changed the index.html to it, and it loaded the text fine.. Im lost, I have no idea what to try or what to do.

Every single variable that you use in the context of the table you apply a codemethodmissingcode to is never nil, since I have to return an object that can be called in order to codepass the buckcode of the potential call from the index function to an actual call. p  pi.e. After defining a global methodmissing as above, attempting to call undefined method testprint runs as expected, but the value of testprint when indexed is nonnil, and other methodsvariables that arent responded to, like codethisshouldbenilcode are nonnil.p  pSo is it possible to avoid this pitfall Or can the syntax not be bent to support this modification without modifying the language source itself I imagine the difficulty arises in how in Ruby, indexing and calling are analogous, whereas in Lua they are distinct.p

Is there anything I can do about this I already checked whether disabling antialiasing or enabled the rasterrenderer makes a difference, but it doesnt.p  pExample When using a viewport size of 450px, 200px, a window size of factor 100 45000, 20000 and thus font sizes scaled up by factor 100 as well 1400pt, rendering 30 times the text hello takes about 4 seconds on Linux  both on OpenSuse and Ubuntu.p  pThe same sample renders in a snap on Windows and Mac.p  pJust for clarification although the font size is scaled up, the text appears in normal size on screen due to the described windowltviewport mapping.p  pHere is the simple sample code I am usingp  precodevoid WidgetpaintEventQPaintEvent event      const int scaleFactor  100      QPainter painterthis       Setup font     QFont font     font.setPointSize14scaleFactor     painter.setFontfont       Setup mapping     painter.setWindow0, 0, width  scaleFactor, height  scaleFactor       Render the text     for int i  0 i lt 30 i         painter.drawTextqrand  width  scaleFactor, qrand  height  scaleFactor, Hello  codepre  pAny help would be awesome.p  pNote I am using Qt 4.8.5p

I have the query as followsp  precodestatquery  SELECT CONCATrepmaster.firstname,  , repmaster.lastname, tour1.totalcalls, tour1.acw, tour1.revenue, tour1.envelopes, tour1.pens, tour1.other FROM repmaster LEFT JOIN tour1 ON repmaster.id  tour1.id WHERE repmaster.leader  LENTSCH  statresult  mysqli gt querystatquery while statrow  statresult gt fetcharrayMYSQLINUM      echo lttrgt     foreach statrow as i          arraypushstatarray, i         echo lttdgt . i . lttdgt          echo lttrgt  codepre  pThis produces a nice little table that lists the statistics for each representative, but I need to be able to organize the information so that I can display it in a preformatted table. My thought is that I should create multiple instances of a PHP representative class, or at the very least have an associative array. What I want to have isp  precodeRepresentative Name    Total Calls    ACW    Revenue    Envelopes    Pens    Other codepre  pI should also mention that there are four intervals for which data needs to be organized tour1, tour2, tour3, tour4.

Negative 148 pDoes OCaml have slices like D slices of immutable data  It seems like it would fit really nicely into the OCaml paradigm you could avoid constantly having to reverse a list every time you want to do any kind of processing with tail recursion, because you can accessslice the list from both ends.  Would it be difficult to implementp  pAs an example, if OCaml lists behaved like slices, I could sayp  precodelet merge lhs rhs    mergehelper lhs rhs []  let rec mergehelper lhs rhs res       match lhs with      [] gt res  rhs      lfirst  lrest gt         match rhs with          [] gt res  lhs          rfirst  rrest gt         if lfirst lt rfirst then             mergehelper lrest rhs res  [lfirst]         else             mergehelper lhs rrest res  [rfirst] codepre  pWhere lhs  rhs attempts to concatenate them by copying rhs into the space next to lhs if available and otherwise copies them into a new slot in memory at least twice as large as lhs.p  pEDIT Perhaps I need to clarify Concatenation such as let concatted  lhs  rhs is not a mutating operation.  lhs will be the same as it was, and rhs will be the same as it was. concatted may or may not point to the same segment of memory as lhs just with a larger length.  The copying I was talking about is an underthehood operation.  From the clients perspective all objects behave as if they were immutable and the construction lhs  rhs takes amortized Orhs time amortized in the sense that if we keep on constructing longer slices by repeatedly concatenating things on the right, the number of internal reallocations is small.p  pEDIT 2 Sorry, I was imagining that concatenating behaves like D appending.  D doesnt do this because they also allow slices of mutable data, but in OCaml things default to immutable, so this wouldnt be a problem at least, no more than it is for D lists.p

Negative 148 pIve checked other answers regarding the asynchronous updates of codeListFragmentscode and have figured out that the most common problem for the codenotifyDataSetChangedcode method not working is, that developers tend to overwrite the initial adapter source, causing the adapter to lose reference and hence not updating the view.

Negative 148 pI have created a tree that are made up by patches in the 2D world. The canopy of tree is green colour.

Negative 148 pIm using ImageMagick to convert a few hundred thousand PDF files to PNG files.  ImageMagick takes about ten seconds to do this.  Now, most of these PDF files are automatically generated grading certificates, so its basically just a bunch of PDF files with the forms filled in with different numbers.  There are also a few simple raster images on each PDF  I mean, one option is to just throw computing power at it, but that means money as well as making sure they all end up in the right place when they come back.  Another option is to just wait it out on our current computer.  But I did the calculations here, and we wont even be able to keep up with the certificates we get in realtime.p  pNow, the option Im hoping to pursue is to somehow take advantage of the fact that most of these files are very similar, so if we have some sort of precomputed template to use, we can skip the process of calculating the entire PDF file every time the conversion is done.  Id do a quick check to see if the PDF fits any of the templates, run the optimized conversion if it does, and just do a full conversion if it doesnt.p  pOf course, my understanding of the PDF file format is intermediate at best, and I dont even know if this idea is practical or not.  Would it require making a custom version of ImageMagick  Maybe contributing to the ImageMagick source code  Or is there some solution out there already that does exactly what I need it to Weve all spend weeks on a project, then had this happen, I imaginep

I can of course do this like sop  precodechild  DaChild child.name  parent.name child.number  parent.number codepre  pThe thing is that while developing, this class will grow to have a fairly large number of attributes, and I dont constantly want to change the manual copying of the attributes into the child.p  pIs there a way to automatically take over the attributes of the parent object into a new child object All tips are welcomep  p[EDIT] Just to explain the WHY I want to do this. I use the a hrefhttppeewee.readthedocs.orgenlatest relnofollowPeewee ORMa to interact with my DB. I now want to revision a table meaning if a record gets updated, I want keep all previous versions. The way I intent to do that is by for example creating a codePersoncode class and a codePersonRevisioncode class which inherits from the codePersoncode class. I then override the a hrefhttpsgithub.comcoleiferpeeweeblobmasterpeewee.pyL3546L3565 relnofollowpeewee save methoda to not only save the codePersoncode object, but also copy all attributes into a codePersonRevisioncode object and save that as well. Since I will never actually directly interact with the codePersonRevisioncode class I dont need shadowing or any fancy stuff. I just want to copy the attributes and call the object its codesavecode method.p

Originally I was going to just use a contentcontrol and host the view inside it, but then I wondered if maybe there might be a reason to have the contentcontrol select a Page from the actual page class as opposed to a view that extends user control.p  precode   ltWindow.Resourcesgt         ltDataTemplate DataTypexType localHomeViewModelgt             ltlocalHomeView gt         ltDataTemplategt         ltDataTemplate DataTypexType localProductsViewModelgt             ltlocalProductsView gt         ltDataTemplategt     ltWindow.Resourcesgt   ltDockPanelgt     ltBorder DockPanel.DockLeft BorderBrushBlack BorderThickness0,0,1,0gt         ltItemsControl ItemsSourceBinding PageViewModelsgt             ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt                 ltDataTemplategt                     ltButton ContentBinding Name                             CommandBinding DataContext.ChangePageCommand, RelativeSourceRelativeSource AncestorTypexType Window                             CommandParameterBinding                              Margin2,5gt                 ltDataTemplategt             ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt         ltItemsControlgt     ltBordergt      ltContentControl ContentBinding CurrentPageViewModel gt ltDockPanelgt codepre  pp

Negative 148 pI am developing an application where I have defined a variable object containing data in the form of a numpy array. These variables are linked to netcdf data files, and I would like to dynamically load the variable values when needed instead of loading all data from the sometimes huge files at the start.p  pThe following snippet demonstrates the principle and works well, including access to data portions with slices. For example, you can writep  precodea  var    empty variable print a.values[7]    values have been automatically loaded codepre  por evenp  precodea  var a[7]  0 codepre  pHowever, this code still forces me to load the entire variable data at once.

Examplep  precodef  netCDF4.Datasetfilename, r print f.variables[a][7] codepre  pI cannot use the netcdf variable objects directly, because my application is tied to a web service which cannot remember the netcdf file handler, and also because the variable data dont always come from netcdf files, but may originate from other sources such as OGC web services.p  pIs there a way to capture the slicing expression in the property or setter methods and use them The idea would be to write something likep  precode    property     def valuesself         if self.values is None             self.values  np.arange10.[slice]   load from file ...         return self.values codepre  pinstead of the code below.    p  pWorking demop  precodeimport numpy as np  class varobject      def initself, valuesNone, metadataNone         if values is None             self.values  None         else             self.values  np.arrayvalues         self.metadata  metadata   just to demonstrate that var has mor than just values      property     def valuesself         if self.values is None             self.values  np.arange10.   load from file ...         return self.values      values.setter     def valuesself, values         self.values  values codepre  pFirst thought Should I perhaps create values as a separate class and then use codegetitemcode See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23213057inpythonhowdoicreatetwoindexslicingformyownmatrixclassIn python, how do I create two index slicing for my own matrix classa p

The final list suppose orderbydescending times.p  precodevoid Main      string s  Using the Thread class The Thread class can be found in the System.Threading namespace. This class enables you to create new treads, manage their priority, and get their status. The Thread class isnt something that you should use in your applications, except when you have special needs. However, when using the Thread class you have control over all configuration options. You can, for example, specify the priority of your thread, tell Windows that your thread is long running, or configure other advanced options. Listing 11 shows an example of using the Thread class to run a method on another thread. The Console class synchronizes the use of the output stream for you so you can write to it from multiple threads. Synchronization is the mechanism of ensuring that two threads dont execute a specific portion of your program at the same time. In the case of a console application, this means that no two threads can write data to the screen at the exact same time. If one thread is working with the output stream, other threads will have to wait before its finished.      var a  s.Splitnew char[] , ,, lt, ., gt, , , , , , ,  , , , [, , ], , , , , , , , , amp, , , , , , , ,          var q1  a.Whereo gt o.IsEmpty      var q2  q1.Distinct      var al  new ArrayList      foreachvar w in q2              al.Addnew result times  GetTimesq1, w, word  w           al.Dump   public FuncltIEnumerableltstringgt, string, intgt GetTimes  arg1, arg2 gt      var rst  arg1.Counto gt o  arg2     return rst   public class result      public int times get set     public string word get set  codepre

I also trained the program so that it knows that values between code5..15code for codeacode and code0..2code for codebcode classify the given object as codelabel1code.p  pAs the program evolves, I need to further train it with known data so that the attribute intervals will get more accurate hence the classification.p  pNow, I havent got any experience with machine learning or any of this kind and I would like to know how should I start with this.

I would have 56 labels to start with and their number will soon increase. Also, the object attributes are integers.p  pAny tip is highly appreciatedp

Negative 148 pIm looking for a conditional formatting rule for when the current row excluding the cell to be formatted contains a string value. The formatting should be as in the image below. Green font if the rest of the row contains codeXcode, red font if no codeXcode is present elsewhere in the row.

Negative 148 pI am writing a webpage that will display statistics for a MySQL database that is maintained independent of the website. The idea is to have in constanly polling the MySQL DB and keeping the website up to date without having to reload it. I have a php page that does all of the database polling and logic on how or what to display. The main page the user accesses has a function that reloads the php page at a constant interval thereby automatically refreshing the polling on screen. p  pAfter I wrote everything it would work great for a while then it would crash without fail after a few hours regardless the browser I used. In chrome I brought up the Task Manager and noticed that the memory increased a lot in a short period of time. It would take a little under an hour to go from 10 mb to over 1 g. My initial thought was there was a large memory leak in the php script possibly from polling the MySQL database that often. To ensure it was that I commented out everything in the php script yet the leak still persisted. It has to be in the html and jQuery code I wrote. Javascript is not my forte, I am a novice to say the least. But I do know it has garbage collecting and so I thought my poor implementation is somehow preventing it from GCing.Can anyone see what may be causing this The index.html is below. Like I said, index.php is blank now so I cant see what that would have any effect.p  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltlink typetextcss relstylesheet hrefstyle.cssgt     lttitlegtStatisticslttitlegt     ltmeta httpequivpragma contentnocachegt     ltmeta httpequivcachecontrol contentnocache, nostore, mustrevalidate, maxage1, maxstale0, postcheck0, precheck0gt     ltmeta httpequivexpires content1gt     ltscript src.jsjquery1.11.2.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript src.jsjquery1.11.2.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscriptgt          document.readyfunction              refreshpage.loadindex.php             var refreshId  setIntervalfunction                  refreshpage.loadindex.php                 , 5000             refreshId  null             refreshpage.unload             .ajaxSetup cache false                   ltscriptgt         ltbody classbgroundgt             ltcentergt                 ltdiv idrefreshpagegtltdivgt             ltcentergt             ltimg idlogoShift srclogo.pnggt         ltbodygt ltheadgt codepre  pp

Negative 148 pI am attempting to have a table which can switch the background color based on an RGB value, where each row of the table has clickable codelttdgtcodes, and they will add up to give and RGB value eg. first row is  123, second row is  123.p  pstrong2strong The issue Im running into currently is that when I attempt to pass my DOM  object from my listenercreating for loop to the codeswitchJS function, the DOM that is being passed incodedomobj is undefined.p  pI would then like to switch the value of the hidden inputs inside of the codelttdgtcodes each time the user clicks, and define a separate function probably not in the JS to add them up and render a rgb color based on that.p  pAs I said, strongthe real issue is above as 2strong, but any other help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 148 pI went over this many times looking for what I could be doing wrong.  Basically in my C application I have a class that accepts a message from SignalR then fires an event with the message for any listeners.  Ive got many custom events working just fine and Ive compared this code and it all seems fine.p  pIn the messaging class I have thisp  precode    private string message  string.Empty      public event EventHandler evtNewMessage      public string szMessage              get  return this.message          set                      this.message  value              if this.evtNewMessage  null                 this.evtNewMessagethis, new EventArgs               codepre  pIve put a break on the line if this.evtNewMessage  null and I can see that the message makes it there, but the this.evtNewMessage is always null so the line following this.evtNewMessagethis, new EventArgs never runs.p  pI also verified the calling app... p  precodepublic partial class TestFunc  Form      ...     sigClient oClient  new sigClient      public TestFunc              oClient.evtNewMessage  EventHandlerDataReceived         oClient.Startup         Listen           private void Listen              oClient.RunTests           private void DataReceivedobject sender, EventArgs e              var receivedMessage  System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetStringe.Data         sigClient TempObj  sigClientsender          tbOutPut.Text  TempObj.szMessage      codepre  pI set a break on the line oClient.evtNewMessage  new EventHandlerDataReceived and I can see the event is null before and assigned after the line is run.p  pThe function DataReceived never gets hit because the event is never fired it thinks nothing has subscribed.  I can break the execution at any point and I can see the event is assigned in the application.  However, when I step into the child class, it shows the event as nullunassigned.p  pAnyone know what may be going onp  pEdit I set up another test where I initialize the comm class, subscribe, and send a test message before the threads initialize and it works.  For some reason, the threads are overwriting the handler but its not a static class so Im not sure why thats happeningp
Negative 148 pIm trying to get the height of every h2 in a div, then if that height is higher than 21px, apply a class to that h2 or change his css.p  pThe reason for that is that I have my project titles overlapping the tags when theyre longer than a single line p  pa hrefhttpwww.elisagilis.be relnofollowhttpwww.elisagilis.beap  pso far Ive tried this p  precode.postdetails h2.eachfunction      ifthis.height gt 21                this.cssmargintop 315px, lineheight 28px         codepre  pAND this p  precode.postdetails h2.eachfunction     ifthis.height gt 21              this.addClassmargintop       codepre  pNone of them work. Ive tried without using each as well, didnt work because it would select all of my h2 and apply the cssclass to all of them.  if you have a better solution than the ones Im considering theyre welcome as well.p  pMany thanks for your helpp
Negative 148 pI am using wplogin with some modifications for a project.p  pOriginally I was using this code in the themes functions.php to have users redirected to the main page after login and everything worked like a charmp  precode redirect users to front page after login  function redirecttofrontpage  global redirectto if issetGET[redirectto]  redirectto  getoptionsiteurl   addactionloginform, redirecttofrontpage codepre  pThen I began testing the site and realized it would be better if people were redirected to the last page they visited.  That way if they were viewing content other than the main page and decided to log in to comment they wouldnt get booted back the main page.p  pI then altered the code to read like thisp  precode redirect users to last page viewed after login  function redirecttolastpage  global redirectto if issetGET[redirectto]  redirectto  SERVER[HTTPREFERER]   addactionloginform, redirecttolastpage codepre  pIt works perfectly except in the case of a failed login.  In that case they get sent back to wplogin with an error message, which is fine.  But when they try to log in a second time and are successful, instead of redirecting back to the site content page they came from they are being redirected back to wplogin with no explanation.p  pI can see it remembers the instance of wplogin without the error as the referer and that this is creating my problem.  But I dont have a good mental picture of how to make this situation conditional, nor has anything Ive read made any sense in the context of my problem.p  pUPDATEp  pI got it to work by starting a session and using the strstr function.  This code was added at the very top of the wplogin.php filep  precodesessionstart  lpage  SERVER[HTTPREFERER] ifstrstrlpage, login.php  false  SESSION[referrer]  SERVER[HTTPREFERER]  codepre  pThen I changed the code in functions.php to thisp  precode redirect users to last page viewed after login  function redirecttolastpage  global redirectto if issetGET[redirectto]  redirectto  SESSION[referrer]     addactionloginform, redirecttolastpage codepre  pHowever, I would rather not be making changes to Wordpress core files.  So if anyone can suggest a way to move all this into functions.php it would be appreciated.  I tried to just add the code into functions.php instead of wplogin but it throws an error.p  pIf someone spots a potential security problem that would also be helpful.p

The script comes with 6 preset filters, but it says you can convert any Photoshop code.acv curves filecode and apply that as a filter. When I look at the development script, it reads a code.acv filecode directly. However, in the production script, the curves files are represented by the following codeA,R,G,Bcode values. My question is, how can I convert one of my custom .acv curves files that I create in Photoshop, into these codeA,R,G,Bcode values so I can use them in this script Any help would be much appreciated.p  precodea[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250,251,252,253,254,255,255],  r[32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,33,33,33,33,33,34,35,36,38,39,41,43,45,48,50,52,54,56,58,60,62,64,65,67,69,71,73,75,77,79,81,83,85,87,89,91,93,95,96,98,100,102,104,106,108,110,112,114,116,117,119,121,123,125,126,128,130,132,133,135,137,139,140,142,144,146,147,149,151,152,154,155,157,158,160,161,163,164,166,167,168,170,171,172,173,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,197,198,199,200,201,201,202,203,204,204,205,205,206,206,207,207,208,208,209,209,210,210,211,211,212,212,213,213,214,214,215,215,216,216,217,217,218,218,219,219,220,220,221,221,221,222,222,223,223,224,224,225,225,225,226,226,227,227,228,228,228,229,229,230,230,231,231,231,232,232,233,233,233,234,234,235,235,235,236,236,236,237,237,238,238,238,239,239,239,240,240,240,241,241,242,242,242,243,243,243,244,244,245,245,245,246,246,247,248,248,249,249,250,250,251,251,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252],  g[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,14,15,16,17,19,20,21,23,24,25,27,28,30,31,33,34,36,37,39,40,42,44,45,47,49,50,52,54,56,57,59,61,63,65,67,69,71,73,75,78,80,82,85,87,89,92,94,97,99,102,104,106,109,111,114,116,118,121,123,125,127,129,131,133,135,137,139,141,143,145,146,148,150,152,154,156,157,159,161,163,164,166,168,169,171,173,174,176,178,179,181,182,184,185,187,188,190,191,192,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,205,206,207,207,208,209,209,210,210,211,211,211,212,212,213,213,213,214,214,215,215,216,216,216,217,217,218,218,219,219,220,220,220,221,221,222,222,222,223,223,224,224,225,225,225,226,226,227,227,228,228,228,229,229,230,230,231,231,232,232,232,233,233,234,234,235,235,236,236,237,237,238,238,239,239,239,240,240,241,241,242,242,243,244,244,245,246,246,247,248,249,249,250,250,251,251,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252,252],  b[2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,8,8,9,9,9,10,10,11,12,12,13,13,14,15,15,16,17,17,18,19,19,20,21,22,23,24,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,32,33,34,35,36,38,39,40,42,43,45,47,48,50,52,54,56,58,60,62,64,66,68,70,72,74,76,78,80,82,84,86,87,89,91,93,95,96,98,100,101,103,105,107,108,110,112,113,115,117,118,120,122,123,125,127,128,130,131,133,135,136,138,140,141,143,145,146,148,149,151,153,154,156,158,159,161,163,164,166,167,169,170,171,173,174,175,177,178,179,180,182,183,184,185,186,187,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,195,196,197,198,198,199,200,200,201,201,202,202,203,203,204,204,204,205,205,205,206,206,206,207,207,207,207,208,208,209,209,209,210,210,211,211,211,212,212,213,213,214,214,214,215,215,216,216,216,217,217,218,218,218,219,219,220,220,220,221,221,222,222,222,223,223,224,224,225,225,226,226,227,227,227,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,228] codepre

Negative 148 pIn my iOS app, I have to restrict the user to use iOS app per device. To do this I found a solution that we can use the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma21878670identifierForVendor methoda of codeUUID Universally Unique Identifiercode which will generate a unique ID to uniquely identify an app on a device.

Negative 148 pDays of troubleshooting on this one, googling solutions amp rereading Microsoft documentation on the needed functions.  Changing variables, retrying again and again.

Ideally Id like to get the last 50 or so runs and generate a graph showing the time it took to execute over that period of time.p  pThe first thing we thought about was to just create our own database and wrap each execution with a codeStopwatchcode then save the duration to our database. We could then just query this database and build the graph that way.p  pBut since this was the very first time we used WebJobs, we quickly found out that most of the stuff we wanted to log is already logged automatically by the WebJobs SDK. Things like start times, duration, function name, etc, all exist already in the logs and would be enough for us to build our own display around.p  pThe problem then is how to query those logs from our MVC project in a suitable format. I could of course read from the blob storage directly and join the data manually, but I was looking for a more high level API. To me the storage containers used by the WebJobs are an implementation detail that could change in the future.p  pWhen searching for that, I found numerous ways to get to the data, but I feel none of them are really what I was looking for. p  ul lipThere is the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryazuredn495187.aspx relnofollowcodeGetAzureWebsiteLogcode PowerShell cmdleta that returns the data for a set of runs for a job. This looks ok, but I wanted something callable directly from .Net, and Id like to see the console outputs for the action too, and I cant seem to find those with this cmdlet.pli lipThere is a hrefhttpsgithub.comprojectkudukuduwikiWebJobsAPI relnofollowa WebAPIa to query the logs for a given job. That one seems to be returning the exact same response as the PowerShell version the PowerShell cmdlet is probably calling the same REST endpoint under the covers. So the same problems apply.pli ul  pBy looking at the actual files created on the blob storage account, I can get access to the output logs for each run by inspecting the codeazurewebjobshostsoutputlogscode folder and correlating the id there with the values on the codeazurewebjobsdashboardfunctionsinstancescode folder, so I suspect it would be possible somehow to get them using a more high level API. Also, if such API was available, I wouldnt need to worry about having to create type safe models for each API response and things like that.p

Negative 148 pAs of late, maybe during the past few months, Googlemail started flaggingmarking mails coming from my domain as spam. I am running a postfixamavisd clamav and spamassassin combination that is configured quite rigidly so I hardly see any spam in my own inbox. I am using SPF, DMARC, DKIM, dont allow relay access, dont do any header rewriting and my IP is not on any blacklists. Reverse DNS etc is set up and working fine. Also, in essence, I only have one user me.p  pI have noticed that my mail is delivered properly no SMTP errors whatsoever but is immediately marked as spam and moved to the spam folder of any new Googlemail inbox that Im sending to. Now, by nature of my business, it happens from time to time that I have to send mails to clients that I have never mailed before. I cannot possibly call every single one before sending them a mail and ask them to check their spam folder... Also I use several from addresses on my domain, i.e. sending mails from sales as well as info. When info is marked as non spam in Googlemail mails from sales are still being delivered directly to the spam folder so not even this works for me. When looking at the header fields in the received mails, there is only passok and no mention of failed.p  pI tried contacting Google via their various web forms and also added a Google site verification TXT record in my DNS entries but to no avail. Not even a response.p  pThe same thing happens for Hotmailliveoutlook.com inboxes where mails from my domain are immediately moved to the spam folder. Problem here is that there doesnt even seem to be a way to contact Microsoft to address these kinds of problems.p  pSo, is there anything else I can do Other things I should check Do you know of any contact addresses I could write to Any last resorts to tryp  pIn its current state, my mailserver is essentially useless and Id argue if the situation doesnt improve the whole email system is doomed. If no one can host their own mailserver anymore we can all just as well go to Google, Microsoft or Facebook and hand them over our data which we are already doing anyway. If the old, federated mail system is not working, in my opinion, there is no need for email anymore and we could resort to Facebook messages, whatsapp and the likes.

Negative 148 pI have recently written a custom driver for a phy that is connected to an ARM processor running a Linux 3.8 kernel. I wrote the driver because I could not find a driver that supported the fiber interface on this phy in the open source community. My driver seems to be a little buggy but I am not sure why. Here is what I am seeing.p  p1 During boot I will get and IP address through DHCP udhcpc in this case only about 50 of the time.

Negative 148 pJust finished installing mongodb, however, I have not been able to make complete sense of the difference between codemongocode vs codemongodcode commands. Yes, I do understand that p  blockquote   pmongod is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB systemp blockquote  pand that p  blockquote   pmongo is an interactive JavaScript shell interface to MongoDBp blockquote  pbut what does that mean practically I presume every time I want to use mongodb, I need to run codemongodcode first. But then why am I able to run codemongocode without having started codemongodcode first Does codemongocode run codemongodcode in the background automatically Secondly, if I run codemongodcode it eventually ends with something like p  blockquote   pwaiting for connections on port 27017p blockquote  pbut then I cant type anything after that. Again, I presume that mongodb has been started in the background so I can safely close the terminal. But if I close the terminal by mistake on a mac, how can I get that back up on the terminal Also, how can I terminate the service for it to stop listening to the portp  pSo as you can I see, I have a bunch of simple questions... but most are related to the practical uses of when and when not to codemongocode or codemongodcode. I cant seem to find anything online that will help me explain these in the practical sense.p

Negative 148 pIve spent over 10 hours on this problem and basically scoured the entire internet for a solution. Its a simply jQuery ajax POST method, one that Ive used a few times before successfully. In the past I had this problem also but somehow solved it. The data Im passing seems to be okay, in the network console of chrome it even shows a successful post with the supposed data. However, using .load to get that data always returns null. In the code below, I used a form that I prevented from default submitting to prevent a refresh.

Negative 148 pThis is a weird question... The context is that somehow, my program keeps creating weird arbitrary blank users with no information.

Unfortunately the user looks like thisp  precodeltUser id 175, email , createdat nil, updatedat nil, encryptedpassword , resetpasswordtoken nil, resetpasswordsentat nil, remembercreatedat nil, signincount 0, currentsigninat nil, lastsigninat nil, currentsigninip nil, lastsigninip nil, confirmationtoken nil, confirmedat nil, confirmationsentat nil, unconfirmedemail nil, failedattempts 0, unlocktoken nil, lockedat nil, stripecustomerid nil, stripecardid nil, invitecode nil, invitedby nil, profilepic nil, firstname nil, lastname nil, fullname nilgt codepre  pI didnt realize it was possible to have this happen creation without codecreatedatcode, so am curious to see what could lead to this, and maybe that will help the debugging.p  pFYI I have tried to just look at my log over a long time period but the weird thing is I definitely do NOT see the actual codecreatecode action being called so many times. I even have a codeputscode statement right after the codecreatecode just to catch this and it has only been logged twice the appropriate amount. FWIW Im using Devise.p  pThanksp

Negative 148 pI am considering using node.js to build an API like service but am having trouble understanding whether to use a data structure vs. storing information in a databasetext file.p  pBasically the program would allow for a user to come on line and collect that users geocoded location. Then the service would store that information in either a javascript data structure or store it into a database or text file. Then another user would log on and I would connect them with a user who is closes to them.p  pMy question is, if I have a datastructure some sort of custom implemented sorted list based off of geocodes would all of that information be volatile and I would loose it if the program crashed  p  pWould it be more preferable to store the information in a text file or database even though the access and write of that information would take longerp  pAlso, if I was using the data structure approach, would that make it more difficult to scale the application if I needed to expand to additional serversp  pAny thoughtsp
